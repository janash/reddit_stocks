”The volume is low”.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

So, stop panicking pussies. They’ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven’t already. Share this info to other newbie traders

Info of volume can be see in level 2 market data, found free on this stream:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQbg_WU-0AQ&ab_channel=StocksBigPlays

WHAT'S TO STOP THEM FROM DOING THIS FOREVER?

Well, unlike us retarded diamond handed monkeys, everyone with a short position has to pay daily interest on their positions to their broker. The longer they wait the more they have to pay to stay in the game. This is a war of attrition, but one side (us) does not have a financial penalty for staying on the battlefield, the other side (those with short positions) do.

2,AMC,"  

So, let’s just rewind a few days. Thursday, they executed a ladder attack, trading large stock holdings between themselves, gradually lowering the offering each time. What did this do? Trick the market algorithms into thinking there was a mass sell off! Was there really? Fuck no. Did we sell? Fuck no! Did we hold? Fuck yes! 💎🤲🏻💎🤲🏻

In the hours following their futile attempt of BLATANT ILLEGAL MARKET MANIPULATION, the stock rose again to +300, an honest representation of the situation, because none of us retards sold!!!

The corrupts at wall street have had the entire weekend to think of a strategy to keep us at bay. Trying to create hype about silver to distract us, using their media contacts to distort the narrative, scaremongering... has it worked? Fuck no!

What they are now doing is using a reduced form of laddering to keep the main stocks at bay. In other words they will continue to trade between themselves at a level that will keep the stock stagnant. This will be a futile attempt to deceive us that the game is up (excuse the pun) and that the squeeze is over.

People, the squeeze is just getting started! It has barley begun! They will do EVERYTHING in their power to come out on top. The amount of blatant illegal acts they committed last week proves this. There are literally no rules they will not break on their quest to cause panic and ultimately get us retards to sell our stock.

They are continuing to drive the price down now aftermarket in attempt to create further panic so that people sell tomorrow. This is exactly what they want. DO NOT FALL FOR IT!!!

HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART; No matter what people say, what you hear in the media or any other form of bullshit distraction...

THEY CANNOT CLOSE THEIR POSITIONS UNLESS WE SELL. Simple as that. It’s mathematics. The short float is more than the physical amount of existing shares. Bottom line.

They can’t get out of this without buying the shares back. And who controls the price at which the buy back? WE DO!

Everyone just take a step back, chill out, block out the noise and absolutely 100% hold every bit of stock you own. We are winning here. It really is that simple.

If everyone can stay cool and follow this advice, we got this.

Please upvote, share etc. Don’t care about karma or anything this is far more important. The message needs to be spread so that we can do what’s necessary and finally get ours. We’ve spent too long being oppressed by this corrupt system. It’s time for change.

45,RH," I'm probably the last person anyone should get financial advice from, and this is JUST MY OPINION, but I think that has been the plan in the past week or so. If we don't sell, and hold and buy, but more importantly hold, then they will keep LOSING MONEY. Mainly from their interest, and if they've double-downed as some people have been suggesting, then the interest rates are higher and they're losing even MORE money. So much so that either they'll accept our (I mean your, because I ain't no finance person and have just been following this whole shit for the drama and memes) price of 100k and quite possibly go bankrupt, or they'll use some of the dirtiest, illegal tricks to try and invalidate our efforts. 

That's the only scary part that they somehow flip this whole thing using their influence. Apps like RH don't help. I've heard of low upper sell limits, of selling stock without consent, of hacking different accounts, of lending a person's stock until the price goes down, of limiting the amount of stock one can buy, etc. And this is just the app. 

But hopefully they'll lose their money, you guys get your money, and we can look back to this period with the fondest of memories.

76,NEXT," learned this investment tip from my gay aunt. When you buy Gamestop, dont just stare at your phone all day. evertime i buy a stock, I gently squeeze my phone between my glute cheeks and set my phone to vibrate every time the shares moves. the tingling keeps me grounded and focused on the present moment. I find my mind wandering on painful past memories or future anxiety, but my new meditation mantra gently reminds me to focus on the present moment and remain mindful of all the boof stocks I'm buying. namestay is the way. Also, and this is super serious, if you've never had a prostate orgasm, this method is great at relieving stress and relieving the backlog of prostate milk youve built while holding Gamestop. Your investment is more than a financial revolution, it's spiritual orgasmic sexual revolution. Sure these hedge funds want your money, but they want even more than that. They want to repress your prostate milk. I'm talking pure spiritual energy that's inside all of you. Milk your prostate and release your tendies.  Ladies can also tap into this raw spiritual orgasmic jet fuel by placing the phone on the front of your clitoral hood. My wife's gay boyfriend showed me where this is. many women apparently lack sensitivity in this nether region from Hitachi wand over use. This method can bring back that sensitivity and more.
Gamestop isn't just going to the moon. Its going to the milky way.

After a year of being indoors, even as an introvert, I would love to see the people in my community again, share popcorn that is overly buttered with my husband. I had a baby last year during the first wave of the pandemic. She’s only ever been to the grocery store in her 9 months of life. I can’t wait to bring her outside, buy some silly game for her to “help” me play with her pretend game controller, go to the mall, take her to her first movie.

The pandemic has been a global trauma, and we are all yearning for the nostalgia of pre-COVID life. So, to me, those are two companies I love, and am willing to waste money to keep them from going bankrupt.

130,SHO," **How Margin accounts help shorters:**

If shares are in a margin account, they may be loaned to a short without the consent or knowledge of the account owner. If the shares are in a cash account, IRA account or are restricted shares they are not supposed to be borrowed unless there is express consent by the account owner.

Margin account buyers, because of loopholes in the rules, inadvertently aid the shorts. If short A sells a naked short he has three days to deliver a borrowed share. If the counterfeit share is purchased in a margin account, it is immediately put into the stock lend and, for a fee, is available as a borrowed share to the short who counterfeited it in the first place. This process is perpetually fluid with multiple parties, but it serves to create more counterfeit shares and is an example of how a counterfeit share gets “laundered” into a legitimate borrowed share.

Margin account agreements give the broker dealers the right to lend those shares without notifying the account owner. Shares held in cash accounts, IRA accounts and any restricted shares are not supposed to be loaned without express consent from the account owner. Broker dealers have been known to change cash accounts to margin accounts without telling the owner, take shares from IRA accounts, take shares from cash accounts and lend restricted shares. One of the prime brokers recently took a million shares from cash accounts of the company's founding investors without telling the owners or the stockbroker who represented ownership. The shares were put into the stock lend, which got the company off the SHO threshold list, and opened the door for more manipulative shorting.

131,GME," Fidelity and Schwab should meet the Trillion dollar asset balance sheet. I know Fidelity didn't restrict trades in GME from several post by other people and it was their most traded stock last week for several days (maybe even the entire week). Not sure about Schwab. I have accounts with both but did not trade in GME so this is info from other people that posted. There was a post in one of the other subs that had a list of all the brokers that allowed trading in GME. Mark is right about the class action lawsuit payout, I have been involved in at least one and got nothing out of it. Not saying you shouldn't get involved in one, because some money is better than nothing, but don't get your hopes up that you will get a big payout. I'm going to look for the link that had the list of brokers that allowed unrestricted trades in GME and post it here.

What fucked up RobinHood is that they didnt have enough cash to handle the number of customers they had, their margin loans and the requirements from the DTCC.  They have now raised more than $5 billion and that may not be enough.  And its not like they are charging anything for their trades.  

The question becomes whether or not buyers would pay a commission or even a tip to a broker for doing their trades.

137,GME," Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand.  They created a RobinHood Dive.  No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers.  Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.

Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls.  When that margin call happens, its brutal.  They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan. 

That then accelerates the selling. 

Which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particular

>To the Honorable (**Congressman’s Name**),  


>>My name is (**insert name**) and I am writing to you today as one of your constituents because of the injustice that retail investors such as myself have recently experienced at the hands of hedge funds. As you may have heard, on or around Thursday, January 28th, major trading platform brokerage Robinhood, among many others, restricted users from buying certain stocks, forcing shareholders to either hold or sell their positions. These brokerages prevented millions of users from buying stocks and options that retail traders were investing into like GameStop ($GME), AMC ($AMC), Blackberry ($BB), and Bed Bath and Beyond ($BBBY) just to name a few. In fact, it is estimated that roughly half of all Robinhood users owned a position in GameStop when trading was halted. As of 2020, Robinhood had over 13 million users, which would translate to over 6.5 million people being held at the mercy of hedge funds.  


>>During this time, the prices on those stocks tumbled significantly. Robinhood claims to have made the decision to halt trades on those specific stocks to “protect investors from market volatility.” This was a lie, of course. Previously, people could put as much money into a stock or options calls, and Robinhood would not care if you lost all of your money. If anything, the only people they were trying to protect were themselves and their sponsors. It wasn’t until retail investors began to make money that restrictions were put in place. Moreover, during the period in which investors were barred from buying more shares, hedge funds were allowed to trade as normal. This was blatant market manipulation, and they have yet to face consequences.  

 
>>Brokerages like Robinhood, their relationship with MM’s like Citadel, hedge funds like Melvin Capital, and media manipulators like Citron Research need to be immediately investigated. This week has once again shown how rigged this system is. Hedge funds were essentially allowed to reposition themselves without any interference. Truthfully, the SEC should have done something about the 140% short position that GameStop was experiencing before Wednesday. You can’t borrow a car that doesn’t exist; you can’t borrow a house that doesn’t exist. You shouldn’t be able to borrow shares that don’t exist either.  


>>I want to remind you that the subreddit getting attention in the media, r/WallStreetBets, has never been about just one stock. GameStop has been the center of attention after users took notice of clear manipulation in the markets from Hedge Funds shorting over 140% of the available shares with naked short selling. As a frequent Reddit user, I would urge you to not turn this matter into a liberal vs. conservative issue. The likes of AOC, Ted Cruz, Bernie Sanders, and Trump Jr. all agree that this was a violation of a free and open market. Democrats and Republicans alike must come together and hold corrupt hedge funds and brokerages accountable for their actions. It would not surprise me if media outlets and others with influence tried to divide people with politics to distract them from what is happening.  


>>The SEC and FBI need to begin immediate investigations into these actions, and I hope that we can see Robinhood, among others, be punished to the highest extent of the law. In addition to compensating users who owned some of the restricted stocks, I want to see corrupt people responsible for driving down stock prices be incarcerated. While a large fine might sound like a sizeable amount of money to the average person, it is merely a small fee to pay for the upper class to continue crushing working-class Americans. Robinhood, Citadel, and Melvin Capitol need to be held accountable for what took place that day. The Interactive Brokers chairman went on CNBC and openly admitted to these crimes. Moreover, the Robinhood CEO had no answers on his interview. It is blatant market manipulation and hedge funds were able to reduce their losses by more than $6 billion. Please take action on this immediately and hold them accountable for their crimes. The world is watching, and we expect you to do everything in your power to fight for us. We are the 99% and our voices will be heard one way or another. The fact that we are in the midst of a global pandemic makes this issue all the more urgent, as millions of people have lost their jobs and/or homes.

159,DD," this is the thing. finance itself isnt evil by nature. but 2008 has shown us that the rhetoric of ""big money is too difficult for the normal person to understand""... that is what killed the economy. bc after so long of being unregulated & unchecked, people & large financial institutions felt... AND ACTED above the law mostly bc they knew that lawmakers & other nonfinancial people just didnt understand what was going on. like how do you edit a topology maths proof if you never passed algebra? you cant & just wont see the errors. so ppl had no clue about repackaging shitty loans to now have a AAA rating. things looked on the up & up. 

& today thats the bs that cnbc & the media is still presenting. that we autists are really the evil ones bc how dare we attempt to play with the big boys since we are just going to accidentally make it worse for ourselves & our fellow poorAFmen. lolnah. hedge funds arent inherently evil but:
a) our complatancy has allowed them to go fckn rogue &
b) they have THEIR interests at heart... not ours, which is to be expected

so i hope local politics & grassroot efforts remind us that DD is not some mystical dragon slayable only by a heavily armored knight...thats what will change the dynamic long term. & wsb is but a drop in the ocean bc the average person is fully capable of learning which indicators tickle his dick & consult the greeks at will.

& i mega super hope more college students go into finance. but unlike skynet maybe we can nurture the turk, finding the moral ppl to pivot into handling money... while the regular apes quick fckn around & start learning THE BASICS to at least point out when fire is hot.

192,GME," What I posted above: 

GME has 51m float. Meaning that to come down from 140% to 50% represents about 45 million of volume. In the last 5 days the total volume was 400 million. So even though shorts covering aren't that much of a 'tiny' amount, they can very easily get lost in the total 400 million volume, where they represent only ten percent.

If it went from 140% to 50% in like, one day, then it would probably be responsible for a spike.
 
On 1/27 the stock closed at its highest, $340 - it had closed at $150 a day earlier. And those two days had a combined volume of 280 million. It looks like those two days could easily have accounted for a lot of the shorts covering, and that could be part of the volume.

197,SO," Hi! I’m a journalist - and this is 100% correct. Outlets have gotten better at avoiding this in politics, thanks to the last five years. But it’s still a big issue on other beats.

Now that newsrooms have shrunk, beat reporters usually handle the features and longer stories on their beat. Very few outlets still have breaking news reporters specifically dedicated to a beat.

That means shorter breaking-news style articles are usually written by early-career news general assignment reporters on insanely short deadlines, which usually aggregate the other news. All it takes is a few reputable folks saying misinformation, and boom, it’s getting propagated by hundreds of people without the knowledge or ability or time to fact check.

The only thing I’d push back on is calling it “lazy.” Lazy implies you have the option of doing better. With newsrooms so short staffed, none of us are lazy. We burn out SO fast. Newsrooms are broke, cheap, and value quantity over than quality (not always, but often) and because newsrooms are broke, reporters are overworked and under-resourced.

Not that there aren’t lazy reporters out there. But true laziness is reserved for the 70-year-old-Big-Names who really need to retire, but like having something to corner younger reporters with at cocktail parties.

PS: if you don’t like quantity-over-quality news, consider becoming a member of your local public media companies/member stations. I am very very lucky to have escaped commercial news. Public media is a land of no quotas and time.

As tempted as I am to dump my $6000 of life savings into GME, I'm very comfortable with the $1150 I have in it.

But if that $1150 magically turns into $35,000-$40,000 then I'll buy a couple rental properties, and tell my boss I'm quitting with my naked hairy ballsack resting on his desk.

285,GME," Thank you sir,

Also I’ve been thinking that it’s being reported over and over that the negative business case for GME is that people don’t go to stores and buy games anymore and the only way forward is streaming.

I actually think that’s completely opposite.

Just like I can’t wait to go out and meet friends and get rejected by girls at clubs again I can’t wait to go visit a physical GameStop again. Talk to the cool staff, browse through the Preowned games, buy yet another popfigure and then just slide the game into my new ps ( that I will buy at GameStop) without download times.

Add to that all the publicity GameStop received cause of the stock and I believe GameStop will have the same if not better reopen effect than other stores, restaurants etc.",HappinessSloth,15,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lajk83/today_wasnt_a_bloodbath_for_gme_or_amc_we_watched/gloz89b/,0.065,0.861,0.074,0.0664

Those of us with funds but already have GME shares can set lower and lower buy prices. This means if all the buy prices hit we will have bought in at a better price than, say, if we yolo in all at one price. 

That would also mean they sell to us at lower prices, and they HAVE TO buy back from us at higher prices later.

357,GME," I don't know whether this applies directly to this GME case, but it could be an advantage of the hedge funds' low latency for High Frequency Trading (HFT). The computers of the hedge funds that run the algorithms (HFT) are installed inside the exchange's building to execute trade orders as fast as possible. The servers of these computers are co-located right within the exchange to get the lowest possible latency. A lower latency equals faster (trade) order execution, which the hedge funds can benefit from. The hedge funds pay the exchanges for these spots.

390,AMZN," To basically make it more attractive to people who might not normally consider investing in the stock because it's too expensive.

Example, last year $TSLA did a 5-1 split so if you had 10 shares on the date they decide to ""record"" shareholders you'd have 50 shares on the date they ""execute"" the split as long as you hold on to those shares until the distribution date. If $TSLA didn't do that their share price would now be around $4.2k at open today which makes it not look attainable for a lot of people (in comparison AMZN opened at $3,380). 

I'm noting these 2 because some people might hear about the split and decide to buy stock after the ""shareholder of record"" date but before the distribution of new shares. If that's the case, most of the time you'd be entitled to the additional shares but not all the time. Since I'm not a trading expert and cannot give trading advice, you'll need to do some chit-chat time with your own advisor.  

I honestly want to see if $AMZN will want to execute a split or not or if the trend now is to have a dong contest for highest price per share.",ItsMeWynter,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lavgj3/my_102_year_old_grandmother_bought_gme_in_august/glqicce/,0.0,0.874,0.126,0.9659

It's also extremely unlikely that you make it to 102, but here she is.

She may have worked for the holding companies (NeoStar, Babbages ETC) and that's why she has stock.

The age of the stock is likely just an updated ticker and whatever company it is just simplified the history.

Watch, she's the former secretary to Leonard Riggio.  Or his former flame.  Who knows.

425,GME," While you aren't wrong, it doesn't matter.

Yes, super duper shady shit just transpired in broad daylight.

The reality of the matter is there is probably 10's of millions of counterfeit shares (or artifact shares depending on your point of view) that have been created along the way. The early shorts most likely used these to exit. New shorts have been piling in as this ramped up way too quickly, and have made an absolute fortune. With the option chain continually getting bumped up, there was no shortage of room for a MM to generate a naked call, sell to a hedge (not through the market, directly), and use that to ""close out"" the short position.

They restricted buying so there was no liquidity run. They know the numbers held by retail, which were borrowable and which weren't. They also knew how many they could borrow from institutions or get them to pop free if need be. Once momentum had been blunted and the gamma squeeze prevented, now it became a game of emotionally wear down retail. They knew exactly where we stood Friday and where they did, and they moved with asymmetric knowledge. Retail was stymied longer than necessary, but now is done just to keep a safety valve on it. The option chain is too large now to get a gamma squeeze, so that risk is off the table.

I think they've abandoned plan A of short GME into bankruptcy and now are in the mode of make some profit and get out of the play and leave the evidence so murky and obfuscated that it would take a smart and dedicated investigator (which there aren't any) and a massive amount of congressional pressure changing laws to force the information to rise. And even then, most of the trail will be punted offshore through multiple channels to make it almost impossible.

The only real hope for change on this, is that a whistleblower from one of the hedge funds comes forward (and I wouldn't count on this).",scbtl,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lalucf/i_suspect_the_hedgies_are_illegally_covering/glq5msw/,0.072,0.84,0.088,0.8745

## Robinhood Cash

A Robinhood Cash account allows you to place commission-free trades during the standard and extended-hours trading sessions. You won’t have access to instant deposits or instant settlements. You can [**downgrade**](https://robinhood.com/support/articles/360001214603/downgrading-from-gold/) to a Cash account from an Instant or Gold account at anytime.

479,CAT," >	Overall, the Division concludes that none of these alternatives is likely to be cost- effective when compared to the baseline. The Division concludes that the benefits to regulatory and public uses of information from Real-Time Short Position Reporting are likely to be modest. In particular, the Division believes that Real-Time Short Position Reporting and Transaction Marking would provide regulators with little additional information than would already be available from the CAT. However, the Division concludes that the implementation and compliance costs, which could include updating or building a system to collect short position reports, are likely to be significant, even if the information is provided to regulators only. Implementing the CAT will enable the Commission to reassess the extent of any additional benefits that may be derived from requiring Real-Time Short Position Reporting and Transaction Marking, and the costs of any additional infrastructure needed to collect such information. Finally, the Division concludes that a voluntary pilot in Transaction Marking is unlikely to be of much utility. While this report concludes that the short sale reporting regimes studied are unlikely to be cost-effective, the analysis contained in this report should still provide valuable insight to potential future rulemaking regarding short sale disclosure.

Questions to keep asking yourself when you start to get feelings of bailing/paper hands:

- Why is the enemy trying SO hard to spread fake news? Our focus is on silver now??? No, it's not. Why would they say that?? Because they see the giant impact we AS INDIVIDUALS have, and want others to follow suit in the wrong direction.

- Why are they CONSTANTLY doing short ladder attacks? You wouldn't do that if you weren't worried!


- Why the buying restrictions?? This happening globally.


- Why the giant influx of bots trying to persuade you not to buy GME?? 


- Why the constant distractions to other stocks??


- Why keep trying to paint the picture everything got taken care of with the short situation?


We have seen patterns forming. Yes, it's a roller coaster. This is not a news flash!

Keep your head focused on the end goal. 

- Why were a ton of $800 calls bought the other day for March, with a stock that has been shown to be unstable and maybe headed downhill??

My name is BoBo, according to the media I am now a ""dumb dumb nazi"" because I just soiled myself into FOMO and joined the party on the dip.

I started a new trading account - randomized all my security questions so I had no hope of getting back into it -  bought $5,000 GME, and tossed the fucking password.

Why, because I have lost way more money to these Wall Street fucks that that, and at leas this time, it is was on my own terms. You can't take what I already gave away and it feel good to be irrational for once.

To everyone who is panicking, the following words are for you:

All of us have been feeling the ups and downs of this ride and, to be honest, don't forget where it all started and how far we've come. And by 'we' I mean the people who like this stock. 

Big hit today, right at the opening. Following this, I had the urge to open reddit and post for the 1st time to make it all clear for you, who obviously feel the doubt about the strategy. Don't feel bad about it, it's normal. You're stading against powerful people who want what we have and will do anything to get it -- starting, as we see, by lowering the prices and targeting stop losses (that you should've canceled already by this time). 

But, just in time of Mark's Cuban AMA, I will spoil the message in his own words:

#  «If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.»

This is the message, this is what I want to say to every single of you retards who are in doubt. It's not all fun and games. Some suits are fighting not to lose billions. We,  the people, are disrupting the market. You thought it would be easy? 

They are doing everything they can to get those shares in your pocket, that's the only way to cover their naked ass. When people have been saying to **HOLD** this is precisely what they fucking meant. **TO FUCKING HOLD**. **THIS IS THE MOTHERFUCKING BATTLE. PEOPLE DON'T SPAM IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S COOL TO HOLD. NO, IF YOU WANT THOSE FUCKING TENDIES YOU CAN'T LET SOME WALL STREET CORRUPT TRASH PARASITE TO COME AND TAKE IT FROM YOUR HANDS. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO GOT CAUGHT HOLDING THEIR PANTS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL AFRAID AND SELL. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD - AND ARE - FUCKING DESPERATE.** 

You genuinely think that if they weren't scared all of this circus would've happen? 

Hold your shares, and, if you can, buy some more. Volume is low, price is in discount. We still have the cheese in our hands. Plus (and correct me if I'm wrong because, you know, I'm a retard as well) they still have contracts to cover. I'm confident we might see the price to rise again today. But even if it doesn't, who cares? You don't pay interests to cover, **patience is key.** Citing Cuban again (damn it feels good): ***«Patience. Disruption is never easy or straight line».***

Guys, one last word: this is the epic journey people have been speaking for months. It's starting to spike (remember VW chart, i.e.). Today we are experiencing one of their last attempts to buy shares from the ones who panicked. This is why people keep yelling to **HOLD!** This is why you should not invest with money you might need, because you don't know how much time you'll have to **HOLD!** This is why you have to know your risk tolerance, to **FUCKING KEEP HOLDING**. 

**JUST TAKE A LOOK TO THE MESIAH IT SELF, DO YOU SEE DEEP FUCKING VALUE SELLING?**

644,VERY," I am a retard and so probably wrong, but for anyone who hasnt watched or read any of u/deepfuckingvalue DD: he believed in this company being a $40-$60 company. With all the free press Gamestop has gotten and will continue to get, at the absolute minimum this is a $40 stock. 
So those worried about losing it all, just know this stock is not settling below $40 even if everyone pulls out. Even if it goes below, its going right back over $40 as smart money buys the dip. Now maybe that will change a year or more out if Cohen cant transition this company into the digital marketplace but for this year, this stock has a lot of potential to succeed even after the squeeze.
So realistic worse case scenario is you lose 2/3 of the current share value. Best case scenario which we all know is VERY realistic, is that this thing rockets over $1000. Its a once in a lifetime opportunity for a slingshot past Mars! 
Plus, you can stick it to these hedge funds, corrupt businesses, media companies and politicians backing the hedge funds. 

I dont know what im taking about, but neither do the people saying this will go back below $20. Hedge funds all over shorted this company initially when it was below $25 and they wont recoup that. No chance.

645,GME," I've seen compelling arguments about how this squeeze was a big dud, its over and the shorts already covered, etc etc.

But nothing they say support the very basic data I can independently find on my broker and other sources. Volume is way down, far less to justify the price activity. You cant open up new shorts with GME. There isnt enough stock. They're examples of failure to deliver. The float is still over 100%. Major hedge funds have already gone under and others have reportable massive losses. 

If this was any other stock under any other circumstance, I could see reasons to get out. I could still get out now and have made decent money. But with everything happening I can see this isnt normal and short sellers are not only in a bad position, their tactics are putting them in WORSE positions if they dont pay off and its showing them to be increasingly more and more desperate.

748,GME," They're not. Everyone is losing their minds over the count at the till, but the shares outstanding are fine.

To the extent the hedgies are doing crazy shit, it's pretty much a sleight of hand to screw with the numbers on failed-to-deliver, stock borrows, and so forth. It's a very X - X + X = X kind of equation.

You'll note they're doing this in the part of the system that doesn't constantly report numbers. That's not an accident. It's a choice. It's the magician palming the quarter.

The final tally of shares is legit. X will equal X when all is said and done.

If it's not, there are much, much bigger problems. That's a Lehman moment.

Also, they're not going to delist GME. That would be unfair to legit shareholders and the company itself.

860,GME," They can short it to 1 cent if they have the funding to do so. They can't, but there is nothing stopping them provided they have the resources. What they need is for us to sell, and the short ladder attacks are being done to scare smooth brain apes into selling up. Think of it as a ""fake price"" and a ""real price""

They're creating the illusion of the stock crashing in value by doubling down. If you sell the share, then you give that share back to the market, and Melvin Cap can buy it back. Making their short ladder attack successful.

If you dig your heels in, they will eventually have to buy back the shares and the share price will fucking rocket.

Think of it this way, no one was interested in GME a year ago, but it was at rock bottom price. Now so many people are buying the stock, so why is it going down? There's legitimate interest in this stock. The only answer is a short ladder attack which will only be successful if we sell our GME shares. DONT SELL.

The more they put into the ladder, the bigger the boom of the squeeze. Let the share price go lower and buy at a low price, your buying power only increases as GME gets laddered. Use their own tactics against them. Buy what you can and hold with hands of diamond.

Apes together - strong.

863,GME," 1) infinitely, the fine is a slap on the wrist compared to the upside, its comes with a cost tho, the shares are available to you, cheaper and still (theoretically) have to be paid back.

2) not much you can do on a macro level as a retail investor, if you think its a fraudulent ladder attack, you could buy and hold, if you think its legit and the price is falling, you should short the stock, same as with every single investment opportunity ever.

GME is completely removed from any book valuations at this point, this is a trade that is based on exactly one thing, the amount of shares shorted.  If the original thesis is true and its still heavily shorted, this is a good trade to be in, if the short positions have closed to reasonable and healthy levels, its a loser, and going to $20 in short order, period.  The end point is $20-$40 range, you could easily make a great short here, and you could also very easily get stopped out at a 100 plus percent loss if the squeeze hasn't happened.  You have to do your own due diligence, and you shouldn't be listening to people on reddit about how to invest your money or use money that you aren't comfortable losing all of to mess around with stuff like this.

Questions to keep asking yourself when you start to get feelings of bailing/paper hands:

- Why is the enemy trying SO hard to spread fake news? Our focus is on silver now??? No, it's not. Why would they say that?? Because they see the giant impact we AS INDIVIDUALS have, and want others to follow suit in the wrong direction.

- Why are they CONSTANTLY doing short ladder attacks? You wouldn't do that if you weren't worried!


- Why the buying restrictions?? This happening globally.


- Why the giant influx of bots trying to persuade you not to buy GME?? 


- Why the constant distractions to other stocks??


- Why keep trying to paint the picture everything got taken care of with the short situation?


We have seen patterns forming. Yes, it's a roller coaster. This is not a news flash!

Keep your head focused on the end goal.

Questions to keep asking yourself when you start to get feelings of bailing/paper hands:

- Why is the enemy trying SO hard to spread fake news? Our focus is on silver now??? No, it's not. Why would they say that?? Because they see the giant impact we AS INDIVIDUALS have, and want others to follow suit in the wrong direction.

- Why are they CONSTANTLY doing short ladder attacks? You wouldn't do that if you weren't worried!


- Why the buying restrictions?? This happening globally.


- Why the giant influx of bots trying to persuade you not to buy GME?? 


- Why the constant distractions to other stocks??


- Why keep trying to paint the picture everything got taken care of with the short situation?

Big hit today, right at the opening. Following this, I had the urge to open reddit and post for the 1st time to make it all clear for you, who obviously feel the doubt about the strategy. Don't feel bad about it, it's normal. You're stading against powerful people who want what we have and will do anything to get it -- starting, as we see, by lowering the prices and targeting stop losses (that you should've canceled already by this time).

This is the message, this is what I want to say to every single of you retards who are in doubt. It's not all fun and games. Some suits are fighting not to lose billions. We,  the people, are disrupting the market. You thought it would be easy? 

They are doing everything they can to get those shares in your pocket, that's the only way to cover their naked ass. When people have been saying to **HOLD** this is precisely what they fucking meant. **TO FUCKING HOLD**. **THIS IS THE MOTHERFUCKING BATTLE. PEOPLE DON'T SPAM IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S COOL TO HOLD.

But even if it doesn't, who cares? You don't pay interests to cover, **patience is key.** Citing Cuban again (damn it feels good): ***«Patience. Disruption is never easy or straight line».***

930,GME," **MIDDAY SUMMARY**

Another ladder attack this morning but we weren't surprised, we saw it coming so we HELD like good APES. You can tell when they've finished a ladder attack because the price of GME comes straight back up.

**WHY IS THE PRICE NOT SKYROCKETING BACK UP TO $200+?**

Basically loads of BROKER BITCHES have placed limits on how much you can order. This then indicates that the demand for GME is very low, hence why the price plummets. These BROKER BITCHES and HEDGE FUCKERS know that true demand for GME is very high. I believe that true demand for GME right now is at least 500,000 people. If the average investment across these 500,000 people is $1,000 that's $500,000,000 worth of demand in a few hours. That would skyrocket the price of GME. The BROKER BITCHES and HEDGE FUCKERS know this, that's why they restricted buying. Unfortunately for them, APES do HOLD!

**WHAT'S OUR GAMEPLAN**

Buy when you can and keep HOLDING. Even Mark Cuban said to do the same thing. Switch BROKER BITCHES if you need to and remove any stop losses.

**HOW LONG UNTIL 🚀🌓**

I think Thursday but it really depends of BROKER BITCHES keep placing limits, if they do, then it could take longer.

**REMEMBER THIS**

If those HEDGE FUCKERS were out of danger right now there wouldn't be any buying limits on GME. It's that simple! They are shit scared 😍

When has Wall St ever cared about retail investors? The answer is never. They didn't care in 2008 and they sure as hell don't care now. MSM has never cared about us and they never will so just keep ignoring them.

THE SHORT SQUEEZE HASN'T HAPPENED YET BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO BUY!!!!!!

**TLDR**

Once people are able to buy GME again in normal quantities, GME's price will skyrocket and APE will go to MOON. Just keeping HOLDING APES

Fuck short squeezes, fuck short ladder attacks, fuck bots and brokerages and whatever.  If you sell now, you’re a super-retard and you are the reason you will lose money.

985,GME," This doesn't mean they can't still short sell, it just changes how and when they can short sell.

The SSR rule is designed to restrict short selling from further driving down the price of a stock that has dropped more than 10 percent in one day.  So this rule doesn't kick in unless GME loses 10% tomorrow from close today. They can still short the stock, but only on upticks. Short selling would be permitted if the price of the security is above the current national best bid. The real effect is generally to stabilize the price. When comparing stocks on either side of the threshold in the same hour of trading, generally restriction leads to 8% lower short sale volume and 35 bps higher daily returns.

1. Sell at a loss and lose 50% forever, have horrible dreams that you lost your ticket for a better life
2. Not sell and get on the rocket to escaping your miserable life

Big hit today, right at the opening. Following this, I had the urge to open reddit and post for the 1st time to make it all clear for you, who obviously feel the doubt about the strategy. Don't feel bad about it, it's normal. You're stading against powerful people who want what we have and will do anything to get it -- starting, as we see, by lowering the prices and targeting stop losses (that you should've canceled already by this time).

When people have been saying to **HOLD** this is precisely what they fucking meant. **TO FUCKING HOLD**. **THIS IS THE MOTHERFUCKING BATTLE. PEOPLE DON'T SPAM IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S COOL TO HOLD.

But even if it doesn't, who cares? You don't pay interests to cover, **patience is key.** Citing Cuban again (damn it feels good): ***«Patience. Disruption is never easy or straight line».***

1049,AMC," So, let’s just rewind a few days.

Thursday, they executed a ladder attack, trading large stock holdings between themselves, gradually lowering the offering each time. What did this do? Trick the market algorithms into thinking there was a mass sell off! Was there really? Fuck no. Did we sell? Fuck no! Did we hold? Fuck yes! 💎🤲🏻💎🤲🏻

In the hours following their futile attempt of BLATANT ILLEGAL MARKET MANIPULATION, the stock rose again to +300, an honest representation of the situation, because none of us retards sold!!!

The corrupts at wall street have had the entire weekend to think of a strategy to keep us at bay. Trying to create hype about silver to distract us, using their media contacts to distort the narrative, scaremongering... has it worked? Fuck no!

What they are now doing is using a reduced form of laddering to keep the main stocks at bay. In other words they will continue to trade between themselves at a level that will keep the stock stagnant. This will be a futile attempt to deceive us that the game is up (excuse the pun) and that the squeeze is over.

People, the squeeze is just getting started! It has barley begun!

They will do EVERYTHING in their power to come out on top. The amount of blatant illegal acts they committed last week proves this. There are literally no rules they will not break on their quest to cause panic and ultimately get us retards to sell our stock.

They are continuing to drive the price down now aftermarket in attempt to create further panic so that people sell tomorrow. This is exactly what they want. DO NOT FALL FOR IT!!!

HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART;

No matter what people say, what you hear in the media or any other form of bullshit distraction...

THEY CANNOT CLOSE THEIR POSITIONS UNLESS WE SELL. Simple as that. It’s mathematics. The short float is more than the physical amount of existing shares. Bottom line.

They can’t get out of this without buying the shares back. And who controls the price at which the buy back? WE DO!

Everyone just take a step back, chill out, block out the noise and absolutely 100% hold every bit of stock you own.

1050,GME," So, let’s just rewind a few days.

Thursday, they executed a ladder attack, trading large stock holdings between themselves, gradually lowering the offering each time. What did this do? Trick the market algorithms into thinking there was a mass sell off! Was there really? Fuck no. Did we sell? Fuck no! Did we hold? Fuck yes! 💎🤲🏻💎🤲🏻

In the hours following their futile attempt of BLATANT ILLEGAL MARKET MANIPULATION, the stock rose again to +300, an honest representation of the situation, because none of us retards sold!!!

The corrupts at wall street have had the entire weekend to think of a strategy to keep us at bay. Trying to create hype about silver to distract us, using their media contacts to distort the narrative, scaremongering... has it worked? Fuck no!

What they are now doing is using a reduced form of laddering to keep the main stocks at bay. In other words they will continue to trade between themselves at a level that will keep the stock stagnant. This will be a futile attempt to deceive us that the game is up (excuse the pun) and that the squeeze is over.

People, the squeeze is just getting started! It has barley begun!

They will do EVERYTHING in their power to come out on top. The amount of blatant illegal acts they committed last week proves this. There are literally no rules they will not break on their quest to cause panic and ultimately get us retards to sell our stock.

They are continuing to drive the price down now aftermarket in attempt to create further panic so that people sell tomorrow. This is exactly what they want. DO NOT FALL FOR IT!!!

HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART;

No matter what people say, what you hear in the media or any other form of bullshit distraction...

THEY CANNOT CLOSE THEIR POSITIONS UNLESS WE SELL. Simple as that. It’s mathematics. The short float is more than the physical amount of existing shares. Bottom line.

They can’t get out of this without buying the shares back. And who controls the price at which the buy back? WE DO!

Everyone just take a step back, chill out, block out the noise and absolutely 100% hold every bit of stock you own.

We are winning here. It really is that simple. If everyone can stay cool and follow this advice, we got this.

This is for us!

Launch GameStop beyond the Moon! Hopefully this can help our moral up! Here's my opinion

TLDR: This squeeze gives GameStop the opportunity to compete with the like of Value Steam and amazon

I think GME will fly beyond the moon, I hope this will help our resolve. Please Spread out if you think I maybe on something. ;)

If you read thanks again la! >.<

I would like to imagine this was a multi-year project event would put GameStop on top of the world.

Think about it. Gamestop looks to have reduced their float by 40million pushing the short interest to over 100%. They are the catalyst as to why this short squeeze is happening. They had 100 million share outstanding originally years ago, they aggressively focused on reducing debt and buying back equity these past years which reduced their profits during those same year which only got the shorters to double down and write articles about the potential bankruptcy of GME. Little did the shorters know.

They hired the exo Nintendo chair and executives George Sherman . Specialist in the gaming industry.

Micheal Burry and DFV: Owned (MB)\~1.75 millions shares (DFV)\~100k shares on market. Bring attention to the short interest float to Gamestop

Ryan Cohen: eCommerce Founder of chewy epet store that can compete with likes of Amazon. Taken up 10% of marketable shares away from the Float and bring in expertise on creating an eCommerce business.

Gamestop: Has been reducing expenses (stores and management) and debt over the years and if you've notice when you go to GameStop they no longer just sell video games they have expand their product lines, to memorabilia, board games, electronics, hobby items, and expanding to computer parts.

This quarter: GameStop has had aconsiderable growth of 800% in their e-commerce sales stoking peoples attentions. Plus It is also a new game console generation supercycle so this coming quarter can expect decent revenues.

Brilliant Free Globalscale Marketing Campaign for this company because of the Squeeze. All the News articles, interviews, twitter feed from our lord Elon, and even talk of a movie all free of cost bringing even more attention to GameStop. A great marketing opportunity for a company shifting focus to online e commerce.

Generating a great comeback narrative of all time, a marvel sensationalist story across the world. From zero to hero bring wealth aside from themselves to everyone who believed in it and generating capital injection for this project from the hedging who shorted them for so many years, same capital to work on a new console platform industry equal to value steam. An new industry platform under their guide linked with their new expanded product line.

If you can imagine connecting these dots I feel there's something big coming for GameSpot. I would love to imagine if they launch a brand new online playstore platform at peak of this Squeeze. It would instantly stabilize the price and build huge expectations.

Starting fresh with a brand heavily believed in by it's followers, freshly capitalized by it's shorters, a global sensations with an opportunity to present to the world it's freshly minted ecommerces.

Imagine you had the opportunity to invest in the PC Steam platform product of Value when it just started.

Just my opinion

”The volume is low”.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

So, stop panicking pussies. They’ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven’t already. Share this info to other newbie traders

Info of volume can be see in level 2 market data, found free on this stream:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQbg_WU-0AQ&ab_channel=StocksBigPlays

WHAT'S TO STOP THEM FROM DOING THIS FOREVER?

Well, unlike us retarded diamond handed monkeys, everyone with a short position has to pay daily interest on their positions to their broker. The longer they wait the more they have to pay to stay in the game. This is a war of attrition, but one side (us) does not have a financial penalty for staying on the battlefield, the other side (those with short positions) do.

The open interest of 6,687 refers to the number of contracts that were OPEN prior to the start of the trading day. The open interest (OI) is updated once per day PRIOR to open; it is not updated again until premarket the following trading day. You also don't know if those are long or short calls - it's impossible to tell from OI alone. OI just tells you how many contracts are ""open,"" and you can sell a call to open - effectively shorting the underlying.

The volume for those $800C today was 16k. Volume includes all transactions that occurred this day i.e. sell to open, buy to open, sell to close, buy to close.  So 16k volume doesn't mean 16,000 contracts were open. It could mean 7k contracts were bought to open + 7k were sold to close (could've been opened/closed the same day) + 2k were sold to open. In that example, the volume is 16k even though the net effect was selling to open 2k contracts.

So how do you interpret the volume? You compare OI on consecutive days.

Tomorrow morning the OI will update to reflect the total number of open contracts, so the previous 6.6k may go up OR down depending if net contracts were open or closed. If we use that above example of net 2k contracts sold to open -> tomorrow's OI would be 6.6k + 2k = 8.6k. So you can't look at that 8.6k and say ""That must mean there are 8,600 long calls"" because we just explained that we know 2,000 are short calls...and we have no idea about the other 6,600.

Still, even after looking at how OI changes, it's impossible to say if those are buys or sells without looking at the order book/flow. For example, if the OI goes up by 2k those could be 2k long calls, 2k short calls, or some combination.

The call flow OP posted probably indicates OTM call buying because it's at the ask price (""the \_A"" indicates that), but in that same screenshot he posted there was some large ATM put buying. In this screenshot you could say there were 2k calls bought vs. 1.2k puts, but you have to remember the puts are much closer to the money so they will have a much greater effect on how MM's hedge.

Best case scenario this is a hedge fund hedging against a squeeze since this call option would PRINT if the stock price shot past $800.

Middle case scenario this is just a bullish bet by someone with deep pockets.

1081,TSLA," Gamma squeeze. The person who sold all the calls needs to buy shares to cover the position. They don’t buy all 100 at once though, they only buy enough to cover the delta (fancy word, just know that delta is small if the strike is faaaaaaaar away and it ramps up as the stonk approaches the strike of the call and expiration). As stonk rises, the dealer buys more and it *squeezes* up. 

Basically, it’s a rocket ladder if you will. Well documented over the last year, especially with TSLA. 

And for the hedgies that read this: blame WSB punters all you want, but one of you knuckleheads is hitting those blocks and sweeps. We chew crayons, we don’t throw $2.4M into a block of calls over 100% OTM that expire in two weeks. (@well known macro podcasts, does this look like us collectively punting?

1084,GME," Yes this. If short interest reports are right the shorts have closed a sizable chunk of their position with not a lot of movement in the stock price.

Could be a chance blackrock or another fund is unloading a large chunk of their position for a couple reasons - 1) GME a stock that was $15 a few weeks ago is now $200+, what fund would not want a gain like that and 2) saving the shorts brings back stability in the market, unfucking everyone else’s longs.

Dear SEC and President Biden, I am calling on you today, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that artificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of the laws of the United States.

Currently, GME and AMC stock prices are actively being manipulated using a mechanism called ""short ladder attacks"" to depress the price of these stocks in contravention of 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i.

Further silence from the SEC on this matter not only encourages further market manipulation but also further diminishes public trust and faith in the U.S. Government.

1164,GME," Just copied from my comment earlier, I don't think the SEC will help or harm the hedge funds in the GME matter. Thinking it over, while helping them some how will benefit them in the short term, the long term consequences would be catastrophic.

SEC helping them would cause world wide outrage for one. Many countries and its citizens have invested in this stock and screwing it up or nullifying it would hurt country relations. 

It would also cause business around the world to be less likely to invest or buy into the American Market. As if anyone would invest in a company on the off chance it just poofs into nothing because hedgefunds fucked it up and made a huge scandal.

And if the SEC were to help then toss the current head as a sacrifice, everyone would point to the next head to fix it or worse, call on Biden for accountability. Try telling millions of people you screwed them over cause the hedgefunds were losing money so ya gotta go back to being poor. I'll try harder for you next time. Absolute shit show that could cost them any future political viability. Progressives would never vote liberal due to them being in wall streets pocket. They would be handing over everything to Conservatives in the next 4 years on an election they barely won. Not to be political on this last point as this situation shouldn't be but one cant deny the effects have shockwaves into other parts of life.

Simply put the SEC's best move would be to sit and watch the hedge funds involved blow themselves up and then investigate with a slap on the wrist and make some rules after that will probably restrict retail investors in the future (disguised as protecting them of course).

Dear President Biden,

I am calling on you today, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i, titled Manipulation of Security Prices, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that artificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of the laws of the United States.

Section 78i(a) clearly states that ""It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of any facility of any national securities exchange, or for any member of a national securities exchange -- (2) To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, a series of transactions in any security registered on a national securities exchange, any security not so registered, or in connection with any security-based swap or security-based swap agreement with respect to such security creating actual or apparent active trading in such security, or raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.""

Currently, GME and AMC stock prices are actively being manipulated using a mechanism called ""short ladder attacks"" to depress the price of these stocks in contravention of 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i. ""Short ladder attacks"" occur when large institutions in possession of the aforementioned stocks sell them for just less than market value in rapid succession between one another in order to drive the price down. The fact that short ladder attacks exist is apparent from on-going market activity that can be seen here [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades) and [https://imgur.com/gallery/Y9TVxCj](https://imgur.com/gallery/Y9TVxCj) Such blatant attacks readily establishes prima facie case of market manipulation and must be investigated by the SEC immediately.

I'm holding until $10K or the super peak gets squoze. I just want to see GME worth more than the entire global economy for a brief moment in history and break the market, because they should fix mechanics that allow it to break like this. Shouldn't be possible, but what would you expect from a bunch of ""autists"" that grew up figuring out infinite damage loop holes in Yu-Gi-Oh who moved on to the game of the stonks market. Like card games, this exploit should get nerfed, but atm, it's legal.

That said, I learned a lot about the stock market, and probably will make investments as a result of this experience that will far outweigh the potential loss. At least I didn't short and have infinite liability like Melvin. Probs never going to short ever until they set a cap on future but back promises. Never take an unlimited risk.

You don’t lose money when you don’t sell, and you don’t make money when you sell a loss. All over this people have been saying don’t invest what you don’t have to burn in a dumpster fire. So if your upside down, it’s on you. Post your fuckkng loss porn and ride it out. I have watched this WSB as a lurker for years and even I thought there was no way this would work out.

It’s a fucking wager against the fuckers that think GME is only worth $40. People say valuation like it is a perfect expectation of company performance and value if you had to liquidate. They act like this value is NOT the figment of some VC’s wet dream, who would gladly undervalue something until it’s a guaranteed bet at 60% ownership of the company. Again this is my opinion, from someone who used to think economics were predictable cyclical things.

What WILL destroy them is the message we are sending with GME to normal people. We have shown everyone that you can take a few bucks today and have thousands tomorrow. You don't need to give someone else your money, you can invest on your own and do better then the ""Big Guys"". Little by little as the average person retakes control of their futures, fund after fund will disappear. 

But this wont happen if everyone here lose their shirts. If we do, the big guys will use this as an example of why the average person cant be allowed to invest. They will call for restrictions to ""protect us for ourselves"". Self-directed brokers will put more and more restrictions on us.

1306,GME," Thank you.

I'm not a denizen or anything but this was always a place to discuss high-risk, high-reward plays. This is something that needs to exist. Personally it was a great resource when I could *not* afford to go all in and ride a single trade into the ground, but could put my limited funds into fail-fast carefully targeted plays, and with an immense amount of hard work and vigilance have found a new path to success. The humor and commiseration (of sorts, ha) here has helped keep me sane.

I never saw a lot of pitching, let alone touting. At most it was ""join me in this stupid move and lose all your money too"" or ""I'm gonna be rich and you'll regret laughing at me"". And then, like /u/DeepFuckingValue, put your money where your mouth is and wait to earn mockery and/or respect.

What is this nonsense where people come in off the street ""I am poor and sick children depending on me and no idea what I'm doing"" and the response is ""all in GME, retard... literally can't go tits up... you'll have your own mansion next week"" except it's not meant as a joke nor taken as one? This isn't even a case of people misunderstanding the culture or whatever; this is people earnestly seeking advice and getting led down a garden path, and the absolute worst-case outcome is that it actually pays off for them with no understanding of how or why. Getting unsophisticated investors to FOMO in at the peak with assurances of guaranteed wealth, for personal benefit may I add, is wrong.

(The same infestation has already taken root in the community for a certain canine-related digital ledger. It was bad enough when they were all going to put in $20 to get it to $1, ""for a meme"", but now it's ""we're gonna get it to $5 or $10... imagine if you loaded up your whole paycheck!"". And another nice and fun thing is ruined. (Pharma pennies, meanwhile, have always been a minefield but now that scene is horrible too.))

If this keeps up there will no longer be a resource for people desperate or wealthy enough to YOLO *advisedly*. You'll also get them and yourselves and every innocent bystander banned from your favorite things: margin and options. Stop.

1307,DD," It's been a struggle to find real solid DD and separate those who know what they are saying vs. the 90% of people here who are new. Recently it sounds like a fever pitch in here and the conspiracy theories are getting wilder and wilder.  In googling around and trying to learn about Short Ladders attack, search results have one article from 2014 and then the rest are all in the last 3 days from here. I'm not saying a short ladder attack isn't real but if you all truly believe every time the stock drops it's a ladder attack, then I think you don't understand that a lot of people are in fact selling. Volume down? Yes, but price is up - every time price doubles, volume halves- it's still the same $ amount moving. So. these things are repeated over and over again, and I think we are repeating some false (or at least misunderstood) truths here. 

For sure, sketchy and even illegal things have happened - the entire robinhood blocking purchases and tanking the price I think was a seminal moment that \*may\* have killed this whole thing, because I think when the share price dropped it gave the opportunity for a lot of cover. Everyone says volume is low but they are still trading 30, 40 million shares a day - lots of that could be covering. Not saying it is, but none of us seem to really know if what S3 is saying about covering is right.

I liked the stock at $10, even at $80 I saw a huge squeeze coming, and I liked the stock. At $200 it turned to madness. I'm glad AMC was saved though. /u/DeepFuckingValue is great, he posted his positions for a year while getting laughed out of the sub. He's done great, even if the remainder of his position tanks.

Good news?

10K stock has been on fire sale for two days!

I wanted to buy yesterday, and MM were kind enough to lower the $GME price to the point where I was able to buy 2 this morning instead of 1 at close.

1395,GME," Got some bad news for you. Lol. He has been cashing out slowly and incrementally over time. He’s not the architect of *this*, he probably expected GME to go from 5 to 50, not 500 or 1k or anything. He’s talked about the long term value of the company from the start.

1396,RH," He needs to dot his i’s and cross his t’s. Everyone on this sub basically doesn’t care whether their posts could be considered market manipulation. Because some retard telling people to switch their RH accounts to cash won’t actually have a material affect on GME’s price, it doesn’t really matter.

However, if DFV posts tonight that he sold, it would crash the stock, imo. It would be akin to Ryan Cohen announcing he his selling his shares. When something you say has a material impact on the stock price, what you said needs to be totally above board or you’re gonna get fined by the SEC.

1399,GME," the market is all about luck. Microsoft deal waas nowhere on the horizon. Pandemic retail trading was nowhere on the horizon when he invested. Creating what literally became the biggest investing story in years was nowhere on the horizon. Cohen was nowhere on the horizon. The nintendo guy joining was nowhere on the horizon. Burry buying GME stock was nowhere on the horizon.

For everyone who sticks to a thesis that a failing company is salvageable, there are 10 who were probably doing the same on HTZ, or PYX.

if i had to guess, GME had cash and assets to stay afloat for a while, and were trading so low that just becoming slightly profitable and proving they can ""just exist"" indefinitely would have been enough to push the price up. And their cash burn rate probably gave enough time to know that it wasn't going tits up tomorrow. Creates a fairly asymmetrical risk (the good side).

What he did was smarter since apparently he was doing alright financially before, I'm assuming he didn't go all in but allocated a percentage of his port.

The real lesson here is risk management.

2. It still might go back to single digits and ultimately fail one day in the not too distant future. Remember, it's still a dying retailer.

Or is it because his personal money was put into it, which means that RC ventures is an extension of Cohen essentially (hence the LLC i guess). Would that change if he just happened to be the owner of an investor backed fund that invested in GME?

for example if Ryan Cohen wasn't on the board, would RC Ventures still not be able to sell? 

and on the flip side, if Cohen was on the board and RC Ventures didn't sign an agreement, would he be able to sell.

We may see some bizarre moves if WSB doesn't sell, because some people need to hide some crimes. No joke. Here's why I think this may be the case:

---------- The Background ----------

Read this first to understand how naked shorts work:

https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf

Basically, to short a stock, you must “borrow” the stock from another account, usually something like a margin account. This is something that typically the clearing house does on behest of the fund doing the shorting. Most people don’t even know when their shares are being borrowed by a hedge fund for the purposes of shorting.

A “naked short” is when you short a stock, but don’t confirm that the stock you are borrowing actually exists. This can happen when a clearing house either purposefully or inadvertently (ahem, sure) lends the same stock more than once. This basically clones the stock, just like an item cloning glitch in a video game. There are now two copies of the same stock in existence being actively traded… at least temporarily. Hold that thought.

Naked shorts can be devastating to the company being shorted, as not only do they lose liquidity because of the short, the cloned stocks serve to dilute the value of the real stocks being held by artificially increasing the number of stocks being traded. Especially for small companies doing initial investment rounds, this practically guarantees bankruptcy: the diluted value limits the amount of capital they can raise, as the company never sees the cash from the cloned stock.

Now, after the 2008 crash the SEC in theory made this illegal. Obviously, this practice kills companies if the short succeeds or destroys markets if the short doesn’t succeed. Either way, someone gets hurt.

HOWEVER, there’s a catch: Because hedge funds and clearing houses are permitted to operate behind closed doors, the SEC can only detect a naked short when a “failure to deliver” occurs. When someone calls the short, either because of a buy or because someone withdraws the right to loan their shares, the person shorting then has 3 days to deliver. If they can’t deliver the share (because it doesn’t exist) within 3 days, then this gets reported as a “failure to deliver”. Now, the SEC may look past a few of these because floats do happen, but too many and the SEC is obligated to open an investigation.

But of course, that never happens. The clearinghouse only has to report the net deliveries, not the actual transactions. This means that as long as there is someone buying on the day the failure-to-deliver would occur, the clearinghouse can roll the transaction forward… basically just like floating a check. The non-existent cloned stock is bought with the new buy, and the sell of real shares that should have covered that buy is left open but doesn’t need to be fulfilled for three more days. The clock resets. This is sort of like somebody-I-know used to do by floating checks back and forth between two different bank accounts: keeping the money in the air for several weeks until payday by continually writing checks to cover checks. Super unethical, but does work.

But, this can’t be continued indefinitely. There are SEC rules that make it tough to do this for longer than 21 days. IANAL, I don’t know every loophole, but that’s my understanding.

This is why after 2008 it became so important for the hedge fund to bankrupt the target company. If the company goes bankrupt, then the shares cease to be and the books never resolve. Even some kinds of restructuring can keep the books from resolving. It’s still possible to cover this without bankrupting the company if you can get enough people to sell, but it’s easier to crash the company and just make it all go away while pocketing cash from more shares than were ever real.

1446,BY," In the eras of history past, battles, wars, nations were not decided by the armies, they were decided by the line.

It didn't matter how badly you outnumbered the enemy, if they managed to break your line, FUD would ensue. People would see the oncoming enemy and think ""Oh no! We've lost! I'm next!"" and run for their lives. Leaving them far worse off than before.  


We are in the same situation yet in a new era on a new battlefield, individually we will flee and run, and let those who stand above us win the day. It is only when we are part of the holding line, with thousands of comrades shoulder to shoulder will we have the courage to stand and fight.

mmmmm

I keep a close watch on these hands of mine 
I keep my phone apps open all the time 
I keep the goal Four Twenty Sixty Nine 
These Shares are mine I hold the line 

I find it very, very easy to be true  
I find I still own GME when each day's through 
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a retard too 
These shares are mine, I hold the line 

As sure as night is closed and day is there for 
trade 
I buy the dip and hold although I can't get laid 
And hedgefund bailout news just proves our theory right
These shares are mine, I hold the line 

Wallstreetbets will keep me on your side 
You give me cause to hold i really cannot hide 
For you I know I'd even try to buy the high 
These shares are mine, I hold the line

1492,IRL," Belfort is an opportunist. When I was a broker years back, after he'd gotten out of prison before his movie, everyone in my firm was sharing the persuasion course he had put together that they group bought for thousands of $ and there was no value in it, in my opinion at least.

But people loved the fact that he made a ton of money and didn't care that he fucked over many people in the process. He's a scumbag and I agree, he shouldn't be promoted. He's just trying to sell people on his overpriced course that has been done better by people teaching sales on YouTube at this point. He's trying to stay relevant.

10 minutes of you retards' life. You already have your life savings in, what's 10 minutes?

Basically he says this:

* He thinks it's cool
* He doesn't really want to get in at this price
* Trying to actually take profit during the moment of the squeeze will be like catching a falling knife, so be careful
* If you're in profits, you may want to take out your initial investment and 'just play with the house's money'
* Only put in what you can afford to lose
* These profits wont last forever. Dont quit your day job

Overall, I dont really see what's so negative.

**ALL HE SAID WAS TO BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR MONEY AND DONT GET CAUGHT BAG HOLDING. WHICH TO MANY OF YOU KOOLADE DRINKING RETARDS SOUNDS LIKE ABSOLUTE FUD**

1552,RH," Direct quote from Mark Cuban on AMA on GME:

""If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.

Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.

I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.

I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.""",golobanks,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lau37c/we_can_stay_retarded_longer_than_you_can_stay/glquox6/,0.092,0.832,0.075,-0.5006

1620,GME," I love this.  Bless your heart, you autistic bastard. 🚀🌕

On another note, I really hope they can confirm Gary Gensler soon.  The lax administration set in place by Trump is leading to severe inaction.  The constant ladder attacks, and manipulation in play to drive the price down needs to be dealt with... This is a pervasive issue not just with GME, but throughout the stock market.

They've continued to heavily short the stock, traded stocks back in forth (likely stocks that don't exist), all in hopes of scaring people off, and of driving the price down.  What they wanted was for this stock to crash, they'd pocket the money, and never have to reveal the amount of naked shorts sold.  Until that happens, when the dust settles, they'll have to explain where the stocks came from that didn't exist.  Which they can't do, because they were naked shorts.  They covered part of their short position, yes, from 144% of float shorted to 121%.  That's still heavily shorted...

I hope we can see more action from the new SEC chairman to curb what is illegal activity being conducted with impunity in the market.

This is simply enforcing its own rules against naked shorting. WSB honorary mod and legend status if he gets the SEC to commit to a date of enforcement. 

What would he do about the FTD and short interest? No company should be shorted over 100%. So obviously the HFs/MM know where the shares are at, right? It’s curious this can’t be resolved. 

My suspicion is these hedgies are committing securities fraud or something else nefarious that they are attempting to cover. But what do I know. 

Does he think they are trading counterfeit shares, cooking books or tricking the algos to show a false downward pressure? There are some excellent threads outlining a strong case for share counterfeiting. 

What does he think GME’s share price is going to? It was trending to the 700-1000+ easily before intervention, the gamma squeeze was happening before everyone’s eyes. Investors are holding long, sentiment is extremely high and positive, a huge user base still can’t buy, shorts continue to bleed; that doesn’t sound bearish. SI is still likely >100%. The only thing that truly changed was the ability to buy which remains THE problem now.

What does he think about if there is a conflict of interest of Citadel bailing out Melvin who has a massive short on GME? And possibly leaning on RH to prevent buying of these securities. Questionable ethics and backgrounds of MC, citadel, Point72 and RH. Obviously we don’t know the full story for some reason since the SEC is nowhere in sight. 

What should happen to Robinhood? Thoughts on the way they generate income with Citadel, and further conflicts of interest that seem fairly obvious? Is RH done to him?

What should happen to citadel, a company exploiting data to reap massive profits with impunity, in this case to drive prices down to save their buddies?

These guys are truly the predators of the financial world, casting doubt and fear among retail investors with infinite resources to do so. This has been on display and is still ongoing.

Hopefully he can talk about something more in his wheel house like how he looks for and structures value investments at a time when the equity and real estate markets among others are quite clearly propped up with QE, insane printing, impossible to sustain demand, and interest rates. Does he even look for these opportunities in years like now or shift to a more arbitrage focused strategy. I know there are some decent long term opportunities coming up (Bill Ackman) but they seem so few and far between that I wonder how he approaches them. And also does he think the retail influx that we are seeing so much of right now will stay contained to liquid shares and options markets or will the retail revolution ^(tm) expand to have impacts on more real world, concrete, value investments.

The DTC increased collateral requirements for the clearing houses to 100% (from 1-3%). Who makes up the DTC? The very same brokers that lend to hedge funds. The **clearing houses became aware of the squeeze about to happen**, and ordered retail brokers to stop buying on the retail side. Why is that? For two main reasons: one) they didn't want to payout $15B, and two) they didn't want $300B+ held in collateral by the DTC. They all had the capital, they are just too greedy.

1751,DD," After 2008, Occupy wall street seeing these people laugh at us from on top of their balconies drinking champagne, bailouts, and endless fuck yous to the common man, us, I've made a decision. A reckless, stupid, dangerous decision. But also, for me, the only obvious decision since all of you ALSO have something at stake. I will not abandon you. I promise.

Honestly at this point in life at 40 years old I could leverage all the equity I've ever earned even a tiny bit, (all this solidarity just makes me want to support the community even more) tap in to more savings yet even, and then on top of that go in to a little bit or a LOT of debt. (VERY comfortable with debt. I was born in to debt. I didn't even know savings until I was already a man.)

I have a very strong position (for just some guy) already and I haven't even scratched the surface of what I'm willing to do out of desperation to make these people pay.

The retail investor knows what's happening and was also not stupid enough to overextend themselves early in a war if that's what you want.

Drive it below $100 with your ladder attacks.

I.

Dare.

You.

Ask me if I can afford it. Tell me to only invest what I can afford to lose.

But first, ask yourself. With what's at stake for everyone, can I afford NOT to do this?

”The volume is low”.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

So, stop panicking pussies. They’ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven’t already. Share this info to other newbie traders

Info of volume can be see in level 2 market data, found free on this stream:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQbg_WU-0AQ&ab_channel=StocksBigPlays

The longer they wait the more they have to pay to stay in the game.

The dip is an artificial manipulation tactic. Sell short creates a perception of someone selling. They have to buy back the shares. If you sell, they win.

**ELI5:** 12 trades of bananas sold when the store opened. The sold their bananas for $247M. These trades made the bananas left seem less valuable. About $5000M less valuable or $100 per banana less.

$250M in a handful of large sales created a loss of $5000M in stock value. Why would anyone sell $250M that would be $300M or 1000M if they wait a small bit of time. If these bananas weren't sold, the price would have continued up.

* Small volumes creates a dip that doesn’t represent what people are actually selling/valuing the stock at. Only what we will buy at.
* They might not be selling stocks they have and are selling short more. This means they are selling the stock today which creates a dip, and promising to buy/repay later. This doesn’t represent what people are actually selling/valuing the stock at. Only what they are buying at.

**ELI5:** 12 trades of bananas sold when the store opened. The sold their bananas for $247M. These trades made the bananas left seem less valuable. About $5000M less valuable or $100 per banana less.

# I believe the dip was from NEW short sells (the two trades 333k each) this morning at open.

# Someone(s) is now buying large amount of shares as of 9:56 AM EST:

# - BOUGHT: 120,152 shares at 10:23:33 AM EST for $14,429,053.68 at 120.09 each.

# - BOUGHT: 125,075 shares at 10:42:56 AM EST for $16,259,750 at 130.00 each.

Correct me if I am wrong, but it sure looks like someone is profiting in the hundreds of millions if they shorted at the top.

\-----

$250M in a handful of large sales created a loss of $5000M in stock value. Why would anyone sell $250M that would be $300M or 1000M if they wait a small bit of time. If these bananas weren't sold, the price would have continued up.

I am speculating the following drops that I labeled 'etoro stop loss triggered' was because etoro stop losses were triggered. I do think it could be paper hand selling too. Based on the screenshots of people showing their etoro accounts in manic, the numbers align with their stop loss price.

I’d also like to mention my understanding that:

* Small volumes and millisecond rapid trading can create a dip that doesn’t represent what people are actually selling/valuing the stock at. Only what we will buy at.
* They might not be selling stocks they have and are selling short more. This means they are selling the stock today which creates a dip, and promising to buy/repay later. This doesn’t represent what people are actually selling/valuing the stock at. Only what they are buying at.

Working on the next chart explaining Monday's market closing dip with a $34,613,190 short(?) sell attack. Until then, here is the data:

* 45,246 shares batch sold at $225 on February 1st, 2020 at 4:00:02 PM EST
* 45,246 shares batch sold at $225 on February 1st, 2020 at 4:00:02 PM EST
* 45,246 hares batch old at $225 on February 1st, 2020 at 4:10:00 PM EST

I’ve tracked about 3-4 of these each day. It doesn’t matter how much it dips if we hold. Fidelity is holding. DFV is holding. When I saw \~$200M spent to bring the price down, I bought 1700 shares at $248.87. Clearly not the smartest move to not think they’d keep doing this but holding!

* 45,246 shares batch sold at $225 on February 1st, 2020 at 4:00:02 PM EST
* 45,246 shares batch sold at $225 on February 1st, 2020 at 4:00:02 PM EST
* 45,246 hares batch old at $225 on February 1st, 2020 at 4:10:00 PM EST

I’ve tracked about 3-4 of these each day. It doesn’t matter how much it dips if we hold. Fidelity is holding. DFV is holding. When I saw \~$200M spent to bring the price down, I bought 1700 shares at $248.87. Clearly not the smartest move to not think they’d keep doing this but holding!

1919,GME," # ELI[🦍](https://emojipedia.org/gorilla/): BUY THE DIP!!!!!

Sell short creates a perception of someone selling. They have to buy back the shares. ~~If you sell, they win.~~ It looks like they did this today, as well. This is just a chart speculating on one of the many dips that I believe lead to a significant change in price. I hope this helps you do your own DD using data that I wasn't finding already on r/WSB.

You can replicate the chart here: [https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GME/advanced-chart](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GME/advanced-chart) Set the ""Display"" to Candlesticks, the frequence to 1 min, and the range to 5 days, the move the sliders to narrow your date range to yesterday morning (Feb 1st, 2021).-----

**ELI5:** 12 trades of bananas sold when the store opened. The sold their bananas for $247M. These trades made the bananas left seem less valuable. About $5000M less valuable or $100 per banana less.

\-----

# I believe the dip was from NEW short sells (the two trades 333k each) this morning at open.

# Someone(s) is now buying large amount of shares as of 9:56 AM EST:

# - BOUGHT: 120,152 shares at 10:23:33 AM EST for $14,429,053.68 at 120.09 each.

# - BOUGHT: 117,796 shares at 10:32:33 AM EST for $16,843,650.04 at 142.99 each.

# - BOUGHT: 125,075 shares at 10:42:56 AM EST for $16,259,750 at 130.00 each.

Correct me if I am wrong, but it sure looks like someone is profiting in the hundreds of millions if they shorted at the top.

\-----

$250M in a handful of large sales created a loss of $5000M in stock value. Why would anyone sell $250M that would be $300M or 1000M if they wait a small bit of time. If these bananas weren't sold, the price would have continued up.

I am speculating the following drops that I labeled 'etoro stop loss triggered' was because etoro stop losses were triggered. I do think it could be paper hand selling too. Based on the screenshots of people showing their etoro accounts in manic, the numbers align with their stop loss price.

I’d also like to mention my understanding that:

* Small volumes and millisecond rapid trading can create a dip that doesn’t represent what people are actually selling/valuing the stock at. Only what we will buy at.
* They might not be selling stocks they have and are selling short more. This means they are selling the stock today which creates a dip, and promising to buy/repay later. This doesn’t represent what people are actually selling/valuing the stock at. Only what they are buying at.

1922,ARE," Everyone saying it’s over...

HOW FUCKING STUPID ARE YOU. 

this is exactly what they want. you’re all certain it’s going back to 20$ if your monkey brain with 5 days experience in stocks thinks that big money knows that. it’s obviously being shorted on the way down. This is the idea of a infinity squeeze every time the previous shorts cover new scum will try short it on the way down. after the squeeze if we all hold the line and don’t allow it to slide those shorts will have to cover and so on until they realise it isn’t a good idea to short business that supports tens of thousands of jobs around the world during a pandemic. I don’t think most Americans understand the reach of GameStop (living in Ireland almost every little town has a GameStop). Just because you paper-handed doesn’t make you smart it makes you a idiot for bringing it down and losing out on massive gains for everyone. but it’s not over we may want two lifetimes supply of trendies but shorts are greedy greedy greedy people this is being shorted into the ground. 

TL;DR 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
BUY and hold $GME to squeeze the new shorts truly making a difference and...... trendies 🤯

1939,NK,"  

Yeap - with so much money at risk (literally, tens of billions of dollars) they will try every and anything to create a narrative (one that benefits them).

WallStreet works this way : if they calculate their potential losses to be at 10 billion, they will bribe North Korea to fire a missile towards Hawaii and let it crash in the ocean. If that creates panic in the markets and pushes prices down, saving them from those 10 billion losses, the 1 billion bribe to NK is peanuts. If they get caught later one, they will pay a 500 million fine to the SEC to settle the investigation and still pocket the 8.5 billion saved.

So if they need to, they will create an earthquake, tsunami, an asteroid colliding with the Earth, nuclear war, poison water - anything! As long as it saves them money.

1940,GME," Its on mega sale! Buy if you can. This isn't investing advice as I'm a janitor and handyman. If you have restrictions on buying through your retail broker, then think about what's really happening. BTW the hedgies have been prompted by the move of everyone on WSB going all in with their life savings and stock sales to push this to the ultimate waiting gain. They imagine (and rightfully so) that numb nut retards putting all the money the have in the world on GME, that it's a matter of time before paper handed bitches have to bow out because they were full on retard. They have to outlast those share buyers who will start to bail and help them cover their losses at the lower price because you came in looking for a sure thing. True as it ever was, there is no such thing as a sure thing. This is the casino market of Wall Street. The house will win, and if you bail now because you can't eat or will get evicted, you played into THEIR game, not ours. They're pushing you to emotionally move your sell orders because you're collectively squeezing their nuts so hard. If you can't hold through all this without getting sweaty palms and jump ship, you're playing their END game like a fucking minion. They assembled an army by focusing on the idiot millions that thought this would end Friday/Monday/Tuesday/February/March...this is now a long game. Educate your monkey brain. Hold. Squeeze them. They can't buy a product that's not there (without a fine anyway) and at this point a visit to Washington to explain themselves. What became the get tendies movement (which will work for those who actually fucking hold) evolved into fuck HFs by exposing their game and manipulation. This has become two gun fighters staring each other in the eyes on the streets of Laredo (or Wall Street as the case may be) waiting for the other one to draw.

""If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.

Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.

I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.

I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.""",golobanks,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lauvug/monday_market_opening_attack_explained_how/glqt3lm/,0.092,0.832,0.075,-0.5006

If we think it'd be a solid idea to own our own platform, we could start with initial design and business model.


####Edit 1:


Okay; I think this is getting some heat and some confusion. Nothing is impossible if we set our mind to it. I think last few weeks of chaos in WallStreet and how $GME game brought those greedy assholes to their knees have shown us that. 


I agree there will be a lot hops like a monkey but it'll be worth it. Vanguard might be such platform but seems outdates. Why? Coz despite it being available we never saw growth in retards doing the trades at this level. Robinhood took this to next level and brought a simple and powerful UI for everday people to trade in these uncharted  waters.


I had this idea for last few days but didn't care much coz I was not convinced that people would really care for others. But after seeing how this $GME game unfolded so many legends among the regular people, I am willing to put my sweat in to work with such people and help all of us.


What how where etc etc is secondary, I am sure a lot people are aware of opensource work, we can simply start there and once we have an initial prototype, we can ask all of our fellow humble retards here who got some extra tendies   To spare to do the initial investment and the ball will begin to roll.

His profit is extreme, and he’s **clearly** done the math, and he both comes out on top no matter what, and he’s in for the long haul. I can’t remember where I saw the number, but GME being priced around $200-$500 in the long term seems like a very realistic, and accurate value of the company going forward. So whether that’s in 1 week, or 1 year, DFV still comes out way in top.

2. Fidelity, same, but to a significantly larger degree. They can easily afford the risk, and loss, but they also own a large chunk of GME, 14.6%, or there abouts. 

Not saying this to counter what you’re saying, but I don’t think someone that bought in at 300 with $10,000 should have the same optics as DFV and Fidelity.",Bestlamescreenname,47,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lauvug/monday_market_opening_attack_explained_how/glqkcw2/,0.046,0.826,0.129,0.9062

GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next

Hello all,

If you don't recognize my name then perhaps you haven't seen my posts at the start of all this. You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.

Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.

But what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.

Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.

One of two things can happen to these people:

1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able
2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.

This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.

So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.

Now, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**

If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?

Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.

If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.

Another question to consider:

If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.

The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.

Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.

Now, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:

1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.
2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.

**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.

I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.

**EDIT:** For people claiming the liquidity defense, please tell me why trading on TSLA was not blocked during its insane short squeeze. If that sounds aggressive I'm sorry, I'm truly trying to find an answer to this question. 

**EDIT2:** This all speculation, no one knows what comes next, no one. We just do our best to guess.",gfazojay,276,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lauvug/monday_market_opening_attack_explained_how/glqf98v/,0.108,0.786,0.106,0.599

GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next

Hello all,

If you don't recognize my name then perhaps you haven't seen my posts at the start of all this. You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.

Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.

But what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.

Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.

One of two things can happen to these people:

1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able
2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.

This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.

So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.

Now, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**

If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?

Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.

If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.

Another question to consider:

If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.

The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.

Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.

Now, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:

1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.
2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.

**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.

The SEC is a mess. I wouldnt trust them to do the right thing ever. Its an agency built by and for lawyers to be lawyers and win cases rather than do the right thing

If the SEC gave a shit about ANYONE other than Wall Street you would be able to go there right now and read bright line guidelines about insider trading, shorting, what is a pump and dump, what are the rules for cutting off the purchase of stocks like happened with GME et al

But they wont. They would rather litigate to regulate, which means they love to sue people in order to create new legal precedents.

All you need to know about the SEC and how badly they want to fuck the little guy is that they have the option of using JUDGES THAT WORK FOR THE SEC when they sue you rather than you have the option to have jury of your peers in front of a judge that is independent . Thats how bad the SEC is.

2033,IMO," Down vote me all you like, but realistic opinions hurt.

1) what makes you think “we are here, in comparison to Volkswagen”?

The percentage change from $200 to $400 = 100%

And the percentage change again from $200 to $1000 = 400%

Compare that to Gamestop:

The percentage change from $40 to $483 = 1,107.5%
 
IMO the squeeze has happened.

2) all this “to the moon” is kinda delusional, does anyone understand if this stock actually went past $1500 give or take the whole market would crash and throw us all into a recession? If not collapse the whole system, screwing over everyone. 

I’m all for this movement, but since this thread gained main stream media attention it gained a bunch of people who have no idea how to trade who are also throwing in their life savings and it’s sad to see. 

3) sorry, but the system and odds are against retailers, it sucks, I hate it too but seeing all these folk put in their life savings in hopes of reaching $69,420 is actually messed up. Pump and dump schemes only benefit some people, a lot of people still get burnt and lose all their money and not everyone can sell at the same price making us all rich. That line chart will drop so fast you won’t even have time to react.

4) institutions can get bailed out, retailers can’t. You can’t beat the system, if we knew exactly what was going to happen with a stock, we would all be rich.

Edit: people need to stop making posts that is giving “certainty” behind all this. Nothing is certain, all in all give your speculation but you’re also responsible for destroying people’s lives by feeding them dreams.

2054,GME," Would you stop sharing this garbage around. The dip in the photo was because Lehman went bankrupt and the entire recession kicked into high gear, and the runup had absolutely nothing to do with shorts. The insane VW squeeze was triggered by Porsche decreasing its float to a tiny fraction of what it once was in the span of one day so short sellers panicked and had to cover at ludicrously high costs.

2173,ALL," Seriously guys, hear me out: 

I overslept this morning, but luckily I have a ""Pre-Market Alarm"" on my phone that I usually have set for 9:05am, but I changed it last night to 9:20am. 

I woke up, used the bathroom, sat on the edge of my bed, waited for Market open, patiently waited for GME & AMC to drop down a couple more dollars, sold ALL but 5 of my $BB, $NOKIA, $NKD & 25x $PLTR (still holding the rest for long haul). Once GME & AMC had dropped to what I thought was stagnant enough (seeing at that time RH had lifted restrictions temporarily on share purchasing) I scooped up as much as possible of GME & AMC (turned off Margin last night!), took screenshots in case RH decides to do something crazy, then closed RH. 
Proceeded to open up my Fidelity account, the only 2 shares I have up there are GME & AMC...and proceeded to buy more (I have margin, but refuse to use it during this war). Closed both apps....took my medication (just had major surgery 1.5weeks ago), went to cook breakfast (on a 100% liquid diet...errr), sat down and started to watch comedies. 


I DO NOT PLAN to look at my brokerage apps except between 9:20am-10:00am, but ONLY to purchase this dip! 
Constantly looking at your stocks and the false volume fluctuations (Ladder attacks) will only plant seeds of doubt that will grow into trees of despair and blossom fruits of Misery. Uproot the blight before it spreads. 

Liquidate any shares that you're not willing to hold right now  that are not GME & AMC to slow down this weeks hemorrhaging, (i.e.: My PLTR shares, I honestly believe that it will be a $100-$200 stock if not more....at the beginning of 2022, this is ONLY the 2nd month of the year and I bought them at IPO and when they had that massive dip...I have 10 more months to collect back my 25 shares!) If you have margin and can afford to lay it off and then turn it off....do so! 

AFTER Today don't even look at your Brokerage apps UNLESS ITS to purchase GME/AMC or to sell OTHER shares. Don't look at it tomorrow, Friday or next Monday UNLESS it's for the above aforementioned. 

This is literally just a BATTLE of what can be a mildly lengthy War! Every battle we have can be stretched to 1-2 weeks, to where I would love & want for us to be the victor, but this is reality! Our goal is to win the war and to do that we need to win more battles than lose, the shares are at a discount. The DD's are right there, the fundamentals are right there, TRUTH is right there!!! 
I questioned myself last night before coming to this resolve, I felt betrayed, I felt gullible and I felt that my dreams of being filthy rich had just been utterly destroyed....but then I closed reddit and I researched and researched and researched and.....researched, till I realized the potential of both GME & AMC, actually saw the ladder attacks myself by looking at after hour volume and jumped down the rabbit hole (so to say) and realized that it literally is US vs the HC's...they are gonna do whatever they can do to make money and lose as little as possible.
We LITERALLY and single handedly brought TWO/2 companies that we love and cherish OUT FROM both BANKRUPTCY & DEBT!!!!!! The only way this can venture forward is...UP! 

If I'm willing to hold and wait Months & years for PLTR & Steel to take off....why can't I purchase and hold for a couple of Months for GME/AMC? I've bled more for PLTR & Steel than I have for GME/AMC....and like a retard ape...just kept buying more shares and leap options, cause ""ITS A DISCOUNT TO ME, IT'LL BE SKYHIGH IN A YEAR, BETTER START STOCKPILING"" <--- I can do that.....and be patient...then I damn sure can hold out for 2-3 more months to see this thing shoot up out of the ground like it was freaking Captain Planet!!! 


#BUY & HOLD IT'S THAT DAMN SIMPLE!!! if you can't...then exit out, no harm no foul, just leaves more to us that believe and are ""sure"" this is a risky but definite bet!!!

Constantly looking at your stocks and the false volume fluctuations (Ladder attacks) will only plant seeds of doubt that will grow into trees of despair and blossom fruits of Misery. Uproot the blight before it spreads. 

Liquidate any shares that you're not willing to hold right now  that are not GME & AMC to slow down this weeks hemorrhaging, (i.e.: My PLTR shares, I honestly believe that it will be a $100-$200 stock if not more....at the beginning of 2022, this is ONLY the 2nd month of the year and I bought them at IPO and when they had that massive dip...I have 10 more months to collect back my 25 shares!) If you have margin and can afford to lay it off and then turn it off....do so! 

AFTER Today don't even look at your Brokerage apps UNLESS ITS to purchase GME/AMC or to sell OTHER shares. Don't look at it tomorrow, Friday or next Monday UNLESS it's for the above aforementioned. 

This is literally just a BATTLE of what can be a mildly lengthy War! Every battle we have can be stretched to 1-2 weeks, to where I would love & want for us to be the victor, but this is reality! Our goal is to win the war and to do that we need to win more battles than lose, the shares are at a discount. The DD's are right there, the fundamentals are right there, TRUTH is right there!!! 
I questioned myself last night before coming to this resolve, I felt betrayed, I felt gullible and I felt that my dreams of being filthy rich had just been utterly destroyed....but then I closed reddit and I researched and researched and researched and.....researched, till I realized the potential of both GME & AMC, actually saw the ladder attacks myself by looking at after hour volume and jumped down the rabbit hole (so to say) and realized that it literally is US vs the HC's...they are gonna do whatever they can do to make money and lose as little as possible.
We LITERALLY and single handedly brought TWO/2 companies that we love and cherish OUT FROM both BANKRUPTCY & DEBT!!!!!! The only way this can venture forward is...UP! 

If I'm willing to hold and wait Months & years for PLTR & Steel to take off....why can't I purchase and hold for a couple of Months for GME/AMC? I've bled more for PLTR & Steel than I have for GME/AMC....and like a retard ape...just kept buying more shares and leap options, cause ""ITS A DISCOUNT TO ME, IT'LL BE SKYHIGH IN A YEAR, BETTER START STOCKPILING"" <--- I can do that.....and be patient...then I damn sure can hold out for 2-3 more months to see this thing shoot up out of the ground like it was freaking Captain Planet!!! 


#BUY & HOLD IT'S THAT DAMN SIMPLE!!! if you can't...then exit out, no harm no foul, just leaves more to us that believe and are ""sure"" this is a risky but definite bet!!!

I overslept this morning, but luckily I have a ""Pre-Market Alarm"" on my phone that I usually have set for 9:05am, but I changed it last night to 9:20am. 

I woke up, used the bathroom, sat on the edge of my bed, waited for Market open, patiently waited for GME & AMC to drop down a couple more dollars, sold ALL but 5 of my $BB, $NOKIA, $NKD & 25x $PLTR (still holding the rest for long haul). Once GME & AMC had dropped to what I thought was stagnant enough (seeing at that time RH had lifted restrictions temporarily on share purchasing) I scooped up as much as possible of GME & AMC (turned off Margin last night!), took screenshots in case RH decides to do something crazy, then closed RH. 
Proceeded to open up my Fidelity account, the only 2 shares I have up there are GME & AMC...and proceeded to buy more (I have margin, but refuse to use it during this war). Closed both apps....took my medication (just had major surgery 1.5weeks ago), went to cook breakfast (on a 100% liquid diet...errr), sat down and started to watch comedies.

2205,IT," (sorry to hijack top comment)

To everyone who is panicking, the following words are for you:

All of us have been feeling the ups and downs of this ride and, to be honest, don't forget where it all started and how far we've come. And by 'we' I mean the people who like this stock. 

Big hit today, right at the opening. Following this, I had the urge to open reddit and post for the 1st time to make it all clear for you, who obviously feel the doubt about the strategy. Don't feel bad about it, it's normal. You're stading against powerful people who want what we have and will do anything to get it -- starting, as we see, by lowering the prices and targeting stop losses (that you should've canceled already by this time). 

But, just in time of Mark's Cuban AMA, I will spoil the message in his own words:

#  «If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.»

This is the message, this is what I want to say to every single of you retards who are in doubt. It's not all fun and games. Some suits are fighting not to lose billions. We,  the people, are disrupting the market. You thought it would be easy? 

They are doing everything they can to get those shares in your pocket, that's the only way to cover their naked ass. When people have been saying to **HOLD** this is precisely what they fucking meant. **TO FUCKING HOLD**. **THIS IS THE MOTHERFUCKING BATTLE. PEOPLE DON'T SPAM IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S COOL TO HOLD. NO, IF YOU WANT THOSE FUCKING TENDIES YOU CAN'T LET SOME WALL STREET CORRUPT TRASH PARASITE TO COME AND TAKE IT FROM YOUR HANDS. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO GOT CAUGHT HOLDING THEIR PANTS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL AFRAID AND SELL. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD - AND ARE - FUCKING DESPERATE.** 

You genuinely think that if they weren't scared all of this circus would've happen? 

Hold your shares, and, if you can, buy some more. Volume is low, price is in discount. We still have the cheese in our hands. Plus (and correct me if I'm wrong because, you know, I'm a retard as well) they still have contracts to cover. I'm confident we might see the price to rise again today. But even if it doesn't, who cares? You don't pay interests to cover, **patience is key.** Citing Cuban again (damn it feels good): ***«Patience. Disruption is never easy or straight line».***

Guys, one last word: this is the epic journey people have been speaking for months. It's starting to spike (remember VW chart, i.e.). Today we are experiencing one of their last attempts to buy shares from the ones who panicked. This is why people keep yelling to **HOLD!** This is why you should not invest with money you might need, because you don't know how much time you'll have to **HOLD!** This is why you have to know your risk tolerance, to **FUCKING KEEP HOLDING**. 

**JUST TAKE A LOOK TO THE MESIAH IT SELF, DO YOU SEE DEEP FUCKING VALUE SELLING?**

2206,MAN," (sorry to hijack top comment)

To everyone who is panicking, the following words are for you:

All of us have been feeling the ups and downs of this ride and, to be honest, don't forget where it all started and how far we've come. And by 'we' I mean the people who like this stock. 

Big hit today, right at the opening. Following this, I had the urge to open reddit and post for the 1st time to make it all clear for you, who obviously feel the doubt about the strategy. Don't feel bad about it, it's normal. You're stading against powerful people who want what we have and will do anything to get it -- starting, as we see, by lowering the prices and targeting stop losses (that you should've canceled already by this time). 

But, just in time of Mark's Cuban AMA, I will spoil the message in his own words:

#  «If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.»

This is the message, this is what I want to say to every single of you retards who are in doubt. It's not all fun and games. Some suits are fighting not to lose billions. We,  the people, are disrupting the market. You thought it would be easy? 

They are doing everything they can to get those shares in your pocket, that's the only way to cover their naked ass. When people have been saying to **HOLD** this is precisely what they fucking meant. **TO FUCKING HOLD**. **THIS IS THE MOTHERFUCKING BATTLE. PEOPLE DON'T SPAM IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S COOL TO HOLD. NO, IF YOU WANT THOSE FUCKING TENDIES YOU CAN'T LET SOME WALL STREET CORRUPT TRASH PARASITE TO COME AND TAKE IT FROM YOUR HANDS. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO GOT CAUGHT HOLDING THEIR PANTS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL AFRAID AND SELL. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD - AND ARE - FUCKING DESPERATE.** 

You genuinely think that if they weren't scared all of this circus would've happen? 

Hold your shares, and, if you can, buy some more. Volume is low, price is in discount. We still have the cheese in our hands. Plus (and correct me if I'm wrong because, you know, I'm a retard as well) they still have contracts to cover. I'm confident we might see the price to rise again today. But even if it doesn't, who cares? You don't pay interests to cover, **patience is key.** Citing Cuban again (damn it feels good): ***«Patience. Disruption is never easy or straight line».***

Guys, one last word: this is the epic journey people have been speaking for months. It's starting to spike (remember VW chart, i.e.). Today we are experiencing one of their last attempts to buy shares from the ones who panicked. This is why people keep yelling to **HOLD!** This is why you should not invest with money you might need, because you don't know how much time you'll have to **HOLD!** This is why you have to know your risk tolerance, to **FUCKING KEEP HOLDING**. 

**JUST TAKE A LOOK TO THE MESIAH IT SELF, DO YOU SEE DEEP FUCKING VALUE SELLING?**

They bought en masse, and existing fidelity users had minimal GME to sell. They bought from people at other brokerages that weren’t spammed as the robinhood alternative. People that were locked out of robinhood and other brokerages who weren’t true believers just sold from within Robinhood instead of going through the effort of changing brokers.

We know how they're screwing and marginalizing their retail trading customers for their own benefit and the benefit of their crony insiders. We live in a society where corruption and inequality are elements of success. Once retail traders became concentrated in phone app trading platforms, it's a no-brainer that crony capitalists would use that against them to win, in a pinch.

The only way to prevent trade-platform-based trade manipulation hacks from being used as weapons against retail traders is for retail traders to diversify trading platforms. Everyone should have a ""real"" trading platform with an industry major, either discount or full service, and not just rely on an app. Otherwise the concentration of young retail traders in RH will continue to leave them vulnerable to victimization by market maker manipulations.

WSB needs to have a list of super secure, full featured professional trading platforms, and popular full featured discount retail trader platforms, and finally simple, no-features apps with bad security and trader vulnerability to hacks and manipulation and Robinhood should be in the last group. WSB should advise people to have at least one account with a full service platform that is strong enough to be free from market maker and institutional manipulations.",rhetorical_twix,657,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laubr4/yahoo_finance_calling_it_robinhood_is_toast_after/glq5udf/,0.088,0.775,0.137,0.9287

I hate that I was proven right about this. A few times I called out using RH as a bad move for large plays (and got downvoted to hell for it). Sure, use then to figure out which way is up when you first get into trading (hint: >!it's green. Green is up!<), but moving onto a 'real' platform should be everyone's goal. If they can't handle your trades from end-to-end (maintaining their own clearing house), then you are just asking for trouble at some point, from someone. Go ahead and keep an App like RH (but *not* RH) for small or quick plays, but you should make an effort to transfer all your large, valuable, and/or long-term positions to a real brokerage as necessary.

To be clear I think Robinhood is a shitty brokerage and a shitty app, there's a reason they are considered a joke among serious traders.  But again, that's because they're a startup, and the Fisher-Price version of a brokerage.  They don't have their own clearing house like the big boys that have been around for decades.  They got screwed in this whole situation too.

The big fuck up on the RH side was horrible communication.  They should have come out IMMEDIATELY and said ""we can't handle this volume and our clearing house is screwing us over"".

The major risk is people defaulting, unable to pony up the dough for the prices they *agreed upon* at the time of the trade, when the end of the settlement period comes around. Which is still an issue, though there have to have been other options... eg only allowing trading GME with settled funds maybe? Or just taking out a huge loan and charging a fee on GME buys to make up for it because they know that their non-margin accounts aren't about to default en masse.

2345,RC," I have a spreadsheet that does these calcs. I can tell you what is going on, and that you might be wrong.

Firstly, you are correct about how they define their % float.  They use ""float + synthetic longs"".

Secondly, the 55% figure was from Friday's numbers, as in their numbers they had after Thursday's close. I'm sure there are still screenshots hanging around that show the S3 short shares graph -- they had it pinned at 58m shares that day.  Let's confirm this 55% number:  58m shorted / (46.89m float + 58m synth) = 55.30%.

So 55% shorted S3 float implies 58m shares shorted -- that's what they claimed was shorted as of Thursday.

Their tweet on Sunday claimed that the 58m shorted had gone down to 28m shorted.  In S3 % float, that is 28m shorted / (46.89m float + 28m synth) = 37.39%.  

So, I think you are just using their old Thursday number -- and you did properly back it out into the old % float.  But S3 claims the new numbers are 28m shorted, and were they to put that in their % S3 float terms, that'd be 37.39%.

----

One more sign of hope, though.  I have a spreadsheet tracks # shares shorted divided by what I call ""buyable float"" -- basically the amount of shares that are likely to be available for sale.  This is float, minus some % of institutional shares, minus RC's shares, minus an estimate of diamond hand shares.  I assume all other shares are 20% diamond handed (if due to nothing but investors not actively trading them, forgetting about them, or actually holding).

My estimates are that 15.3m of the 46.89m float are buyable.  I get there from: 30m inst shares (a guess) that are 70% diamond handed (also a guess). 9m RC shares 100% DH. Remaining 7.9m float shares are 20% DH.  Ok, so far 15.3m buyable.

Next are the lent versions of these shares (which, as S3 points out *are* used as float). While not all 46.9m shares of the float are ""buyable"", the vast majority are probably lendable. Regardless, S3 says 28m of them are shorted.  Of these 28m shares, maybe 5m are in WSB's diamond hands. Those ain't buyable.  The remaining 23m are in retail or wherever else... lets assume again 20% DH, so thats 18.4m buyable.

15.3m + 18.4 buyable = 33.7m buyable float.
28m shorted / 33.7m buyable = 83.06% buyable shares shorted

The same calculation friday, with 58m shorted shares is:
58m shorted / 57.7m buyable = 100.5% buyable shares shorted

Notice even dropping the shorted shares by 30m they only improve this figure from 100% to 83%... that's because when they short shares they create more buyable float, and the inverse happens when they cover.

This also highlights how valuable DH shares are.  They are subtracted from the denominator! So they are geometrically leverage.. that is, the less buyable shares there are, the more valuable it becomes to DH each share.

Hope you guys like this shit, took me several hours to come up with this shit.

----

FINALLY one last thing.  If the institutions immediately called back their lent shares, this thing would be over in a heartbeat. Or they'd could print more FTDs, I dunno... haven't dug into that world yet.

Part of me believes this is what Cuban and Burry were getting at. Institutions calling back their massive swath of lent shares would send shorters in an absolute scramble to cover them. They would simply have nobody else to borrow them from, and would have to instantly relend shorted shares multiple times over (which I don't think is even possible). 

I don't know the terms of shares borrowed in bulk by institutions.. it's possible they are guaranteed some amount of time to keep them as borrowed to prevent the institutions from fucking them. I just don't know that world.",pennyether,2095,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/glpc3rs/,0.023,0.821,0.155,0.9972

2388,GME," No it wouldn’t. Financial firms use trading algorithms to slowly close out large positions over a period of several hours to several days. The volume of GME has been as high as 300mm some days. There are only 70mm shares outstanding. A 120% interest would be 84mm shares. Closing out 56mm shares wouldn’t make a dent in the volume if spread out over a day or two. When the brokers cut off trading, the volume was over 150mm. That was more than enough to account for the closing of those short positions.

I know people have been saying this is all retail investors moving the price (and it mostly is), but there is no way that robinhood traders are making up the majority of the daily volume. 10 million people buying an average of probably less than 10 shares isn’t making enough of a difference.

2424,GME," i... don't think anyone's actually answered you correctly yet lol

if you assume GME will fall before it moons, it's because GME falling is a result of, largely, market manipulations. that is, the *actual* price of GME stock hasn't fallen. the reason it would rise again (according to this assumption) is because, even though the price is being manipulated, organizations like e.g. melvin capital *don't have any stocks to buy* (because everyone is holding them)

if you sell, even with the intent of buying when it gets lower, you're selling stock to the people manipulating the prices, and making it easier for them to cover their position. they *want* you to sell, because if they cover their positions, the squeeze doesn't happen.

the basic idea is:

- some organizations (like melvin capital) *want* you to sell because they need to buy stocks, and they need to buy them cheaply so they can cover their short positions. they manipulate the prices to go down, and people get scared and sell (so the price goes even lower)
- if they **can't** cover their short positions within some certain period of time (that is, if no one sells to them), then they have to buy the stock @ whatever price people sell them. that's what a short-squeeze is, and that's what makes the price skyrocket

2482,SHO," **How Margin accounts help shorters:**

If shares are in a margin account, they may be loaned to a short without the consent or knowledge of the account owner. If the shares are in a cash account, IRA account or are restricted shares they are not supposed to be borrowed unless there is express consent by the account owner.

Margin account buyers, because of loopholes in the rules, inadvertently aid the shorts. If short A sells a naked short he has three days to deliver a borrowed share. If the counterfeit share is purchased in a margin account, it is immediately put into the stock lend and, for a fee, is available as a borrowed share to the short who counterfeited it in the first place. This process is perpetually fluid with multiple parties, but it serves to create more counterfeit shares and is an example of how a counterfeit share gets “laundered” into a legitimate borrowed share.

Margin account agreements give the broker dealers the right to lend those shares without notifying the account owner. Shares held in cash accounts, IRA accounts and any restricted shares are not supposed to be loaned without express consent from the account owner. Broker dealers have been known to change cash accounts to margin accounts without telling the owner, take shares from IRA accounts, take shares from cash accounts and lend restricted shares. One of the prime brokers recently took a million shares from cash accounts of the company's founding investors without telling the owners or the stockbroker who represented ownership. The shares were put into the stock lend, which got the company off the SHO threshold list, and opened the door for more manipulative shorting.

2484,GME," So imagine you want to buy $100k of GME shares.

You don't have $100k.

But your broker says 'hey, deposit $10k, and I'll loan you the rest'. But the deal is - if the price _falls_ then you've got to cover the difference, or we'll force a sale so we don't lose out.

Your $100k of stock goes up by 10% -> You make $10k, from $10k down. Doubling your money on a 10% movement.

Your $100k of stock goes _down_ by 10% -> the broker goes 'hey, so we've got $90k of stock, and $10k of your money, and that means you're zero. So give us more money, or we sell your stock at a loss, to cover.'  

You can then either put more of your own money in, or you can shrug and walk away with nothing.  

That's known a 'margin call' - you're forced to either sell or pony up _despite_ losing money by doing so, and being sure the stock is going to the moon if you just wait. 

I use 10% for simples, but the actual ratio varies hugely depending on how rich you are, and how much of a gamble you want to take. 

It's a way of making more money from less capital, but it's also  a way to wipe yourself out. It's pretty common with big deposit accounts, because the broker doesn't really lose out (they can always margin call you) and the trader can amplify their returns",sobrique,128,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawqwr/nice_dip_i_just_bought_another_775_shares_of_gme/glqsc5u/,0.022,0.896,0.083,0.936

2598,GME," Failure to delivery is *legal*. It is only a problem when those exist for longer than 35 days for the *same* share. You can see it as if every naked short is a ticking time bomb.

So, this is how it works:

**Normal market flow**

1. A new share S_NOT_A_SHARE_WITH_VOTING_RIGHTS is made out of thin air by the market maker  
2. S_NOT_A_SHARE_WITH_VOTING_RIGHTS is bought by Retail Joe. 
3. Retail Sandra comes along and wants to sell her share SHARE_WITH_VOTING_RIGHTS. 
4. Market maker buys from Sandra. Then the clearing house switches Retail Joe's share with Sandra's, so he can now vote. 

**Business as usual ""Fuck Retail""-market flow**
  
1. A new share S_NOT_A_SHARE_WITH_VOTING_RIGHTS is made out of thin air by the market maker  
2. S_NOT_A_SHARE_WITH_VOTING_RIGHTS is bought by Retail Joe. 
3. Retail Sandra has diamond hands and isn't fucking selling for 21 days. 
4. Market maker sends a failure to delivery message to the SEC and everything is all good. 
5. Sandra gets paper hands and sells on day 30 to the market maker. 
6. Market maker tells Sandra what a stupid cunt she is. 


**The GME play ""Fuck the SHORTS""-market flow**

1. A new share S_NOT_A_SHARE_WITH_VOTING_RIGHTS is made out of thin air by the market maker 
2. Dana Diamond Hands understands the play and buys GME.
3. Market maker/hedge funds dances around, manipulates media, does pony tricks/short ladders, in order to convince Dana to sell.

GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next

Hello all,

If you don't recognize my name then perhaps you haven't seen my posts at the start of all this. You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.

Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.

But what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.

Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.

One of two things can happen to these people:

1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able
2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.

This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.

So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.

Now, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**

If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?

Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.

If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.

Another question to consider:

If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.

The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.

Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.

Now, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:

1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.
2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.

**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.

I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.

**EDIT:** For people claiming the liquidity defense, please tell me why trading on TSLA was not blocked during its insane short squeeze. If that sounds aggressive I'm sorry, I'm truly trying to find an answer to this question. 

**EDIT2:** This all speculation, no one knows what comes next, no one. We just do our best to guess.",gfazojay,54,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lavgs0/whats_happening_right_now_is_not_a_selloff_but/glqfjx7/,0.105,0.785,0.11,0.754

Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.

One of two things can happen to these people:

1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able
2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.

This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.

So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.

Now, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**

If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?

Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.

If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.

Another question to consider:

If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.

The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.

Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.

Now, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:

1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.
2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.

**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.

I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.

**EDIT:** For people claiming the liquidity defense, please tell me why trading on TSLA was not blocked during its insane short squeeze. If that sounds aggressive I'm sorry, I'm truly trying to find an answer to this question.

GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next

Hello all,

If you don't recognize my name then perhaps you haven't seen my posts at the start of all this. You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.

Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.

But what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.

Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold.

2671,GME," 100s of thousands of shares were sold. There is a large sell off. Hedgefunds successfully manipulated the price low enough monday for a mass sell off today. Shorts are also now profitable and being closed out very likely. 

This thing is over. All the people posting the ""You are here"" VW meme are incorrectly judging the situation. The activity on the subreddit mostly reeks of desperation as profits evaporate.

To everyone who is panicking, the following words are for you:

All of us have been feeling the ups and downs of this ride and, to be honest, don't forget where it all started and how far we've come. And by 'we' I mean the people who like this stock. 

Big hit today, right at the opening. Following this, I had the urge to open reddit and post for the 1st time to make it all clear for you, who obviously feel the doubt about the strategy. Don't feel bad about it, it's normal. You're stading against powerful people who want what we have and will do anything to get it -- starting, as we see, by lowering the prices and targeting stop losses (that you should've canceled already by this time). 

But, just in time of Mark's Cuban AMA, I will spoil the message in his own words:

#  «If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.»

This is the message, this is what I want to say to every single of you retards who are in doubt. It's not all fun and games. Some suits are fighting not to lose billions. We,  the people, are disrupting the market. You thought it would be easy? 

They are doing everything they can to get those shares in your pocket, that's the only way to cover their naked ass. When people have been saying to **HOLD** this is precisely what they fucking meant. **TO FUCKING HOLD**. **THIS IS THE MOTHERFUCKING BATTLE. PEOPLE DON'T SPAM IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S COOL TO HOLD. NO, IF YOU WANT THOSE FUCKING TENDIES YOU CAN'T LET SOME WALL STREET CORRUPT TRASH PARASITE TO COME AND TAKE IT FROM YOUR HANDS. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO GOT CAUGHT HOLDING THEIR PANTS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL AFRAID AND SELL. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD - AND ARE - FUCKING DESPERATE.** 

You genuinely think that if they weren't scared all of this circus would've happen? 

Hold your shares, and, if you can, buy some more. Volume is low, price is in discount. We still have the cheese in our hands. Plus (and correct me if I'm wrong because, you know, I'm a retard as well) they still have contracts to cover. I'm confident we might see the price to rise again today. But even if it doesn't, who cares? You don't pay interests to cover, **patience is key.** Citing Cuban again (damn it feels good): ***«Patience. Disruption is never easy or straight line».***

Guys, one last word: this is the epic journey people have been speaking for months. It's starting to spike (remember VW chart, i.e.). Today we are experiencing one of their last attempts to buy shares from the ones who panicked. This is why people keep yelling to **HOLD!** This is why you should not invest with money you might need, because you don't know how much time you'll have to **HOLD!** This is why you have to know your risk tolerance, to **FUCKING KEEP HOLDING**.

You don't make bets you can't afford to lose.

Accept that you *may* lose and go about your day. Set alerts so you're aware if a huge uptick occurs.

We technically have the upper hand, but it's very pessimistic around here because there are a lot of disinformation bots and a lot of pro-GME propaganda too.

The fact is... it was always a 50/50 gamble. We relied on other investors dogpiling and using a broker that has enough capital to fund it. We used RH. They couldn't fund it. We lost out on the squeeze that day, because a novel company was too poor to capitalise on the cannibalising of their parent. In true WS fashion... they'd have predicted this. They'd have procured funds ahead of time. They'd have let this happen. The executive decision branch at RH is plain dense.

2772,GME," Hey everyone!

I'm relatively new to the party, holding on to my four shares. 🦍🚀

When I joined the movement, the media was covering GME, everyone was talking about how it would be a rocket to the moon. I personally didn't buy into it, and having never participated in the stocks before, I thought to myself that it was some kind of get rich quick scheme.

**HOWEVER,** being a curious ape who doesn't know what the fuck he's doing, I decided to read as much as I could about the situation with GME, and ended up spending countless hours reading up about everything. I've reached a point where I understand ladder attacks, short selling, long sells, squeezes, historical events I had no real understanding of (hello 2008), etc. I've got a minuscule grasp of what is going on, but I'm still a dumb ape, which is why I ended up getting four shares.

What I have observed though over the last few days, is how the coverage of GME has completely changed. I no longer see people outside of here saying this is a rocket to the moon. I see the media trying to make us seem retarded (which we are), I see a massive push for SLV which coincidentally happens just as GME is starting to skyrocket and over the weekend so that hype builds up for Monday. I've seen us get flooded with all sorts of different stocks and bot posts.

The stock is now down to about 135 pre-market, which seems terrible.

But what does that tell us? When we're holding and all of a sudden the media and bots are constantly trying to make us look the other way? When nobody thinks that GME will go to the moon except for the people in on what is going on?

It tells us that we should hold on to every single share of GME we have. It means that we should hold on with diamond hands, which themselves have their own fucking diamond hands. It means that today at open, you need to buy that discounted dip, upgrade your hands from paper to diamond, or if you have diamond hands already, give em an extra set of diamond hands of their own.

💎👐💎👐💎👐💎👐💎👐💎👐💎👐💎👐💎👐💎

It tells us that they are using every single tactic they can to get you to sell, to make it seem like GME is worthless. If they could have tanked the price by now, they would have. They didn't because **APES FUCKING STRONG TOGETHER!** 🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍

Give them hell, and hold on like there's no tomorrow, because we're going to the moon!

**This is the way!**

Now of course, this is all a personal opinion from a retarded ape who understands very little about stocks and who just started a few days ago. So don't base any of your decisions on my stupid retarded opinion.

RH said they will restrict to one share so I though to myself I will buy one share a day but no they actually mean one share total.  So no one can buy there isnt any volume and the only thing you can do is sell of course the price is down of course fud that is the game to get you to sell so they can cover on the cheap.  Think what the stock price would be if we could actually buy it now realize that is what is being stolen from us.

3014,AMC," It’s market speculation. Short reports come out every 2 weeks. So the idea is that companies didn’t give up last week on the assumption we would this week when we can’t see more recent reports. So the squeeze needs to happen by EOW or they will have to “buy in” again. For the same reason that ppl are holding out for the boom, companies will hold out for the drop each waiting until Friday.

https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/interactive-chart

This link provides the information about yesterday's volume. The volume represents the trades that are happening. And yesterday's volume was really low. This means people are not selling. We have been holding, which should drive the price up.

The second one is this:

https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml

This link provides the information about yesterday's supply/demand considering buy and sell orders (on fidelity). The demand is WAY too high for the supply to meet, which should also drive the price up.

The third is this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la8ox3/at_these_levels_its_not_about_the_price_of_the/

Hedge funds are ""fraudulently creating more shares"" and retail are holding. They are using very ugly tactics in order to bring the price down to a number that satisfies them since even $225 is beyond the amount they are prepared to absolutely-have-to-fucking-pay.

Please stay educated. Do not trade emotionally. We do not know when this shitshow will end. But hopefully we will have left a stain of hope in history behind us.

Please feel free to repost this to infinity. It may satisfy alot of people (like myself) who feel extremely anxious after yesterday, and need a pat on the shoulder.

To everyone who is panicking, the following words are for you:

All of us have been feeling the ups and downs of this ride and, to be honest, don't forget where it all started and how far we've come. And by 'we' I mean the people who like this stock.

Big hit today, right at the opening. Following this, I had the urge to open reddit and post for the 1st time to make it all clear for you, who obviously feel the doubt about the strategy. Don't feel bad about it, it's normal. You're stading against powerful people who want what we have and will do anything to get it -- starting, as we see, by lowering the prices and targeting stop losses (that you should've canceled already by this time).

But, just in time of Mark's Cuban AMA, I will spoil the message in his own words:

«If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.»

This is the message, this is what I want to say to every single of you retards who are in doubt. It's not all fun and games. Some suits are fighting not to lose billions. We, the people, are disrupting the market. You thought it would be easy?

They are doing everything they can to get those shares in your pocket, that's the only way to cover their naked ass. When people have been saying to **HOLD** this is precisely what they fucking meant. **TO FUCKING HOLD**. **THIS IS THE MOTHERFUCKING BATTLE. PEOPLE DON'T SPAM IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S COOL TO HOLD. NO, IF YOU WANT THOSE FUCKING TENDIES YOU CAN'T LET SOME WALL STREET CORRUPT TRASH PARASITE TO COME AND TAKE IT FROM YOUR HANDS. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO GOT CAUGHT HOLDING THEIR PANTS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL AFRAID AND SELL. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD - AND ARE - FUCKING DESPERATE.**

You genuinely think that if they weren't scared all of this circus would've happen?

Hold your shares, and, if you can, buy some more. Volume is low, price is in discount. We still have the cheese in our hands. Plus (and correct me if I'm wrong because, you know, I'm a retard as well) they still have contracts to cover. I'm confident we might see the price to rise again today. But even if it doesn't, who cares? You don't pay interests to cover, **patience is key.** Citing Cuban again (damn it feels good): ***«Patience. Disruption is never easy or straight line».***

Guys, one last word: this is the epic journey people have been speaking for months. It's starting to spike (remember VW chart, i.e.). Today we are experiencing one of their last attempts to buy shares from the ones who panicked.

3065,MAN," Just a copy/paste but keep it up retards!💎🤲

To everyone who is panicking, the following words are for you:

All of us have been feeling the ups and downs of this ride and, to be honest, don't forget where it all started and how far we've come. And by 'we' I mean the people who like this stock.

Big hit today, right at the opening. Following this, I had the urge to open reddit and post for the 1st time to make it all clear for you, who obviously feel the doubt about the strategy. Don't feel bad about it, it's normal. You're stading against powerful people who want what we have and will do anything to get it -- starting, as we see, by lowering the prices and targeting stop losses (that you should've canceled already by this time).

But, just in time of Mark's Cuban AMA, I will spoil the message in his own words:

«If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.»

This is the message, this is what I want to say to every single of you retards who are in doubt. It's not all fun and games. Some suits are fighting not to lose billions. We, the people, are disrupting the market. You thought it would be easy?

They are doing everything they can to get those shares in your pocket, that's the only way to cover their naked ass. When people have been saying to **HOLD** this is precisely what they fucking meant. **TO FUCKING HOLD**. **THIS IS THE MOTHERFUCKING BATTLE. PEOPLE DON'T SPAM IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S COOL TO HOLD. NO, IF YOU WANT THOSE FUCKING TENDIES YOU CAN'T LET SOME WALL STREET CORRUPT TRASH PARASITE TO COME AND TAKE IT FROM YOUR HANDS. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO GOT CAUGHT HOLDING THEIR PANTS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL AFRAID AND SELL. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD - AND ARE - FUCKING DESPERATE.**

You genuinely think that if they weren't scared all of this circus would've happen?

Hold your shares, and, if you can, buy some more. Volume is low, price is in discount. We still have the cheese in our hands. Plus (and correct me if I'm wrong because, you know, I'm a retard as well) they still have contracts to cover. I'm confident we might see the price to rise again today. But even if it doesn't, who cares? You don't pay interests to cover, **patience is key.** Citing Cuban again (damn it feels good): ***«Patience. Disruption is never easy or straight line».***

Guys, one last word: this is the epic journey people have been speaking for months. It's starting to spike (remember VW chart, i.e.). Today we are experiencing one of their last attempts to buy shares from the ones who panicked. This is why people keep yelling to **HOLD!** This is why you should not invest with money you might need, because you don't know how much time you'll have to **HOLD!** This is why you have to know your risk tolerance, to **FUCKING KEEP HOLDING**.

Not just that you wanted to stack some tendies, but really what those tendies represent. With the massive wounds we've been taking the past few days I feel like it's time to consider my 'why'

Back in 2008, my family was suckered into one of the variable rate mortgages that banks were issuing and hedge funds were pushing. Due to that move, my family lost our ancestral home. To this day, the bank still holds the home but it's unoccupied. My father passed away 2 years ago and it was his dream for the whole family to be able to enjoy the house and have it be a generational gather place for friends and family. He never got to see his dream come to fruition, but I will make that dream become reality.

The 'risky' move I made buying GameStop was the most educated and well researched play I've ever made, and all of it with the purpose of one day being able to buy back my families home. If this goes the way we all know it will, I will be able to complete my fathers dream DECADES sooner than my current trajectory.

For those of you who are discouraged, take heart in remembering your why. Remember that we are MILLIONS strong and are currently kicking the snot out of a multi-billion dollar hedge fund and we're currently WINNING. The psyops, ladder attacks, directed silver ads, and news stories about how GameStop is dead, are all meant to distract you and convince you to sell and hold on to the few bucks you have left.

3089,GME," From Mark Cuban on why the stock is dropping: 

Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand. They created a RobinHood Dive. No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers. Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.

Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls. When that margin call happens, its brutal. They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.

That then accelerates the selling.

Which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particular

So what to do ?

If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.

Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.

I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.

I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use .

3116,GME," copy/pasting this from the Cuban AMA that's happening now:

Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand. They created a RobinHood Dive. No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers. Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.

Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls. When that margin call happens, its brutal. They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.

That then accelerates the selling.

Which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particular

So what to do ?

If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.

Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.

I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.

I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.",normalize_munting,52,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laujs5/gme_thread_for_2221/glqlvek/,0.157,0.775,0.068,-0.985

Might see a little dip here for 30 mins - 1 hr based on earlier negative MACD from 9-10 AM.

So don’t panic if you see a dip in the next few hours.

Weekly MACD is starting to head negative. Which might extend the dip further 1-2 hours. 

Volume is very low right now though so not a lot of people selling or buying. Price can change wildly and quickly when volume is low. 

If it drops look for a bounce off the monthly 200 EMA around ~$87 if you’re buying the dip.

""**Remember why we HOLD.**"" For he didn't wish tribute or song. No monuments, no poems of war and valour.

His wish was simple: ""**HOLD GME**""  he said to me. That was his hope. Should any free retard come across that place, in all the countless centuries yet to be, may all our voices  whisper to you from the ageless stones:

# Go tell the fellow retards, passer-by, that here, by wallstreetbets law, we HOLD.

**So my king HELD, and my brothers HELD, barely a year ago.**

Long  I pondered my king's cryptic talk of victory. Time has proven him wise,  for from free monkey to free monkey the word was spread that bold  DeepFuckingValue and his retards, so far from home, laid down their gainz, not just for WSB, but for all retards and the promise this  subreddit holds.

Now, here on this ragged patch of earth called Wall Street, **Melvin Capital's hordes face  bankrupcy!**

Just there, the barbarians funds huddle, sheer terror gripping tight their hearts with icy fingers, knowing full well what  merciless horrors they suffered at the first short squeeze. Yet they  stare now across the plain at 10,000 monkeys holding their bananas with **DIAMOND HANDS**!  💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋

3220,GME," [A little paper about shorting](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html)

>Who Profits from this Illicit Activity? — The short answer is everyone who participates. Specifically:

> - The shorts — They win over ninety percent of the time. Their return on investment is enormous because they don't put any capital up when they sell short — they get cash from the sale delivered to their account. As long as the stock price remains under their short sale price, it is all profit on no investment.
> - The prime brokers — The shorts need the prime brokers to aid in counterfeiting shares, which is the cornerstone of the fraud. Not only do the prime brokers get sales commissions and interest on margin accounts, they charge the shorts “interest” on borrowed shares. This can be as high as five percent per week. The prime brokers allegedly make eight to ten billion dollars a year from their short stock lend program. The prime brokers also actively short the victim companies, making large trading profits.
> - The DTC — A significant amount of the counterfeiting occurs at the DTC level. They charge the shorts “interest” on borrowed shares, whether it is a legitimate stock borrow or counterfeit shares, as is the case in a vast majority of shares of a company under attack. The amount of profit that the DTC receives is unknown because it is a private company owned by the prime brokers

DTC is who raised capital requirements on purchases, and allowed brokers to claim it wasn't their responsibility for the GME halt.

Don't feel bad about it, it's normal. You're stading against powerful people who want what we have and will do anything to get it -- starting, as we see, by lowering the prices and targeting stop losses (that you should've canceled already by this time).

But even if it doesn't, who cares? You don't pay interests to cover, **patience is key.** Citing Cuban again (damn it feels good): ***«Patience. Disruption is never easy or straight line».***

3283,RC," Fair value is tough to calculate in the middle of a turnaround play. Reasonable estimates I've seen range from around $60 (assuming RC largely fails) to $235 (assuming it's fair to value their online marketplace as a growing tech company). 

I think $180 is actually a reasonable middle ground. Right now we're oscillating between mania and market manipulation, though. A squeeze could push it a lot higher. If people panic sell, the shorts could temporarily push it lower. In my uninformed opinion it is unlikely to ever again be valued as a company destined for bankruptcy.

You can’t scare an ape out of its position with red. Red is the best flavor of crayon. It means ape can buy more GME for less money.

I fully believe that there's a strong likelihood of synthetic long (Short + buy calls + sell to open puts) is a fantastic strategy for risk management by shorts and you fucking nailed it you beautiful autist.

EDIT:

\> be short seller

\> sell stock short

\> buy calls ATM

\> sell puts ATM

....

Price goes up

\> exercise calls and cover short position

\> use your put money to cover short position

\> announce your short interest has dropped dramatically and wait for crash

\> buy shares at bottom and close short position. you won

&#x200B;

OR

Price goes down

\> buy shares to close short position

\> use money from puts sold to open to help close short position

\> all the buying makes share price go up

\> now use your calls and get them cheaper than at the 'top'

\> close position you did it you tricked the apes.

...unless the apes thought about what you were trying to do?

&#x200B;

Price stays the same  
\> pay more interest for your shorts

\> your calls expire worthless

\> your puts give you a little time to breathe

Yes, but if you then spend the money you borrowed, someone else gets it and deposits it in their bank, and the bank can then lend it to someone else. 

There has been no expansion in currency, but there are positive balances now in the account of the person who made the initial deposit of the dollars which were leant to you, and of the person you paid who again deposited the same dollars. 

Once you allow people to borrow and then sell shares, the same thing can happen. With the short interest on GME now at 51.3%, if all of those shorted shares were borrowed, the long interest could be as high as 151.3%.

Thursday, they executed a ladder attack, trading large stock holdings between themselves, gradually lowering the offering each time. What did this do? Trick the market algorithms into thinking there was a mass sell off! Was there really? Fuck no. Did we sell? Fuck no! Did we hold? Fuck yes! 💎🤲🏻💎🤲🏻

In the hours following their futile attempt of BLATANT ILLEGAL MARKET MANIPULATION, the stock rose again to +300, an honest representation of the situation, because none of us retards sold!!!

The corrupts at wall street have had the entire weekend to think of a strategy to keep us at bay. Trying to create hype about silver to distract us, using their media contacts to distort the narrative, scaremongering... has it worked? Fuck no!

What they are now doing is using a reduced form of laddering to keep the main stocks at bay. In other words they will continue to trade between themselves at a level that will keep the stock stagnant. This will be a futile attempt to deceive us that the game is up (excuse the pun) and that the squeeze is over.

People, the squeeze is just getting started! It has barley begun!

They will do EVERYTHING in their power to come out on top. The amount of blatant illegal acts they committed last week proves this. There are literally no rules they will not break on their quest to cause panic and ultimately get us retards to sell our stock.

They are continuing to drive the price down now aftermarket in attempt to create further panic so that people sell tomorrow. This is exactly what they want. DO NOT FALL FOR IT!!!

HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART;

No matter what people say, what you hear in the media or any other form of bullshit distraction...

THEY CANNOT CLOSE THEIR POSITIONS UNLESS WE SELL. Simple as that. It’s mathematics. The short float is more than the physical amount of existing shares. Bottom line.

They can’t get out of this without buying the shares back. And who controls the price at which the buy back? WE DO!

Everyone just take a step back, chill out, block out the noise and absolutely 100% hold every bit of stock you own.

We are winning here. It really is that simple. If everyone can stay cool and follow this advice, we got this.

Please upvote, share etc. Don’t care about karma or anything this is far more important. The message needs to be spread so that we can do what’s necessary and finally get ours. We’ve spent too long being oppressed by this corrupt system. It’s time for change.

Remember GAMESTOP ACTUALLY HAS VALUE

Love you guys, this is the moment Michael Burry was beating the crap out of his drum set in the big short right before the market crash.   STAY STRONG! I will!

Never forget Feb 1, 2021

This is for us!

Launch GameStop beyond the Moon! Hopefully this can help our moral up! Here's my opinion about what opportunity there is here.

TLDR: This squeeze gives GameStop the opportunity to compete with the like of Value Steam and amazon

I think GME will fly beyond the moon, I hope this will help our resolve. Please Spread this out if you think I maybe on something. ;)

If you read thanks again la! >.<

I would like to imagine this was a multi-year project event would put GameStop on top of the world.

Think about it. Gamestop looks to have reduced their float by 40million pushing the short interest to over 100%. They are the catalyst as to why this short squeeze is happening. They had 100 million share outstanding originally years ago, they aggressively focused on reducing debt and buying back equity these past years which reduced their profits during those same year which only got the shorters to double down and write articles about the potential bankruptcy of GME. Little did the shorters know.

They hired the exo Nintendo chair and executives George Sherman . Specialist in the gaming industry.

Micheal Burry and DFV: Owned (MB)\~1.75 millions shares (DFV)\~100k shares on market. Bring attention to the short interest float to Gamestop

Ryan Cohen: eCommerce Founder of chewy epet store that can compete with likes of Amazon. Taken up 10% of marketable shares away from the Float and bring in expertise on creating an eCommerce business.

Gamestop: Has been reducing expenses (stores and management) and debt over the years and if you've notice when you go to GameStop they no longer just sell video games they have expand their product lines, to memorabilia, board games, electronics, hobby items, and expanding to computer parts.

This quarter: GameStop has had a considerable growth of 800% in their e-commerce sales stoking peoples attentions. Plus It is also a new game console generation supercycle so this coming quarter can expect decent revenues.

Microsoft setting up a multiple year strategy instead of buying them out to help track digital sales on their cloud servers. Maybe forming a new platform development using Microsoft servers.

The squeeze Opportunity, let GameStop the ability to take new capital from issuing shares, literally taking the hedge funds money to fund this new global eCommerce project. In the meanwhile they bring a huge population wealth and stability, thus forming an occult of people who can truly be converted into diehard fans of the company brand.

The squeeze brought in many institution on the long side, such as blackrock and vanguard they actually will have a vested interest in the growth of GameStop. Notice that ETFs top the investments they generally don't sell out their positions entirely

Brilliant Free Globalscale Marketing Campaign for this company because of the Squeeze. All the News articles, interviews, twitter feed from our lord Elon, and even talk of a movie all free of cost bringing even more attention to GameStop. A great marketing opportunity for a company shifting focus to online e commerce.

Generating a great comeback narrative of all time, a marvel sensationalist story across the world. From zero to hero bring wealth aside from themselves to everyone who believed in it and generating capital injection for this project from the hedging who shorted them for so many years, same capital to work on a new console platform industry equal to value steam. An new industry platform under their guide linked with their new expanded product line.

If you can imagine connecting these dots I feel there's something big coming for GameSpot. I would love to imagine if they launch a brand new online playstore platform at peak of this Squeeze. It would instantly stabilize the price and build huge expectations.

Starting fresh with a brand heavily believed in by it's followers, freshly capitalized by it's shorters, a global sensations with an opportunity to present to the world it's freshly minted ecommerces.

Imagine you had the opportunity to invest in the PC Steam platform product of Value when it just started.

To everyone who is panicking, the following words are for you:

All of us have been feeling the ups and downs of this ride and, to be honest, don't forget where it all started and how far we've come. And by 'we' I mean the people who like this stock. 

Big hit today, right at the opening. Following this, I had the urge to open reddit and post for the 1st time to make it all clear for you, who obviously feel the doubt about the strategy.

Practically it's also a human judgement call, both for DTCC & any brokerage. Stocks don't settle for 2 days after the trade, no one wants to be left ""holding the bag"", rapidly changing policies will cause confusion and anger, and therefore it's easier for them just to leave the policies in place.",spencermcc,45,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lavtn1/if_the_squeeze_is_over_and_the_price_is_only/glqwox2/,0.13,0.829,0.04,-0.8047
3565,GME," Actual reason for the trading freezes: TL,DR: brokers are taking on enough risk that they could go broke and their trade facilitators (clearing houses) are demanding $$ up front, because they guarantee the trade to the other party if a broker fucks up. Brokers need to come up with cash or cut down on the risk.  


A lot of these users are trading on margin, so if the stock goes to $2, their broker is on the hook. (if I had 30% margin, I could buy a $240 stock for 160 of my money, but if it goes to 2, my broker has to hope I can come up with the other 80 or they just lose it but get to keep the stock, which is now worth $2. Yay.)  If a broker markets mostly to ~~dumbass gamblers~~  inexperienced traders, gives them easy access to margin and options plays that can go negative, then most of them take the same side on a trade and it's a large part of that brokerage's business, the broker is at risk of going under if they all lose out and mey not be able to afford the damage, especially  if they're relatively small. That's why clearinghouses told RH and others ""U used to only have to put \~30% down on trades I handle for you. You're into too much risky shit, so I need you to hand me the full value of each trade in case you go down, then it's not my problem. You have been margin called."" Also why fidelity and Vanguard are fine- big bois with plenty of cushion who don't let new users play with loan money and stuff that can go negative.

So RH and others 1. need cash 2. need less GME in their portfolio or need it to not be on margin. The sensible thing to do is margin call your users that put a mix of the user's and RH's $$ on a stock with a risk if cratering down, and limit options selling as well as shorting, so what they did is still fucky. I get you don't want to lock users into a trade, so letting them sell makes sense, but not letting them buy cash, I don't see a good reason for that. Granted, I'm just another idiot with internet access and no formal finance education.   


As far as if the squeeze will happen, dunno. I don't have good data and we find out on 2/9 what the short interest is- whether there is still a ton of demand from short sellers who have to buy stock or pay high interest. Maybe they try to ride it out and pay interest, or maybe they try to buy and risk setting off the squeeze if they raise demand too much. Interest on shorts is \~30% apy for the old ones, it was up to 80% for the new ones done when it was high, if I understand what I read.

Coupled with so many people hopping on the train who had never traded stocks before - it's created this artificial gap.

3597,GME," Two more points:

1) Nearly all online brokerages use margin. When you move money to Robinhood or similar you can immediately trade, even though the cash hasn't posted into Robinhood's account. The clearing house knows that, and therefore requires Robinhood to post collateral, and requires more collateral for more volatile assets. The risk is to the system, because check fraud, institutional fraud, and edge cases (maybe, you go bankrupt before the stock purchase is settled) is all very real. 

2) Building from your credit card analog: Very few Americans actually could open 30 credit cards in one week – the banks would check their credit reports and decline, because it would be too much risk. The trades with GME have been very risky both for hedge funds & retail, but retail can't post its own collateral.

GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next

Hello all,

If you don't recognize my name then perhaps you haven't seen my posts at the start of all this. You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.

Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.

But what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.

Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.

One of two things can happen to these people:

1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able
2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.

This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.

So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.

Now, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**

If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?

Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.

If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.

Another question to consider:

If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.

The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.

Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.

Now, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:

1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.
2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.

**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.

I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.

**EDIT:** For people claiming the liquidity defense, please tell me why trading on TSLA was not blocked during its insane short squeeze. If that sounds aggressive I'm sorry, I'm truly trying to find an answer to this question. 

**EDIT2:** This all speculation, no one knows what comes next, no one. We just do our best to guess.",gfazojay,206,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawdj2/this_seems_totally_normal_premarket/glqep2i/,0.107,0.788,0.105,0.2799

Now, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**

If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?

Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.

If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.

Another question to consider:

If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.

The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.

Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.

Now, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:

1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.
2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.

**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.

I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.

GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next

Hello all,

If you don't recognize my name then perhaps you haven't seen my posts at the start of all this. You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.

Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.

But what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.

Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.

One of two things can happen to these people:

1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able
2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.

This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.

So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.

Now, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**

Why do they get cancelled at seemingly random times? No way this shit isn't coordinated.

3817,GME," There seems to be some short comings to this strategy?

1. If shorts sold ATM puts, GME crashes below the put strikes before expiration and the puts get exercised, the shorts will make no money. They may even lose money if they did not cover shorts and GME rebounded. So the shorts will have an interest to maintain GME price level between current and the strike price they sold at, until the puts expire?
2. Calls cover them when GME moons, but we still get to make tendies. And this presumably huge amount of extra open calls would make gamma squeeze more likely? But MMs probably figured out ways to sell these calls without adequate floats now.

I'm retarded so someone please educate me.

Edit: to me it seems buying naked deep ITM calls (e.g. 5c 1/21/2022) is more likely the strategy being deployed.

3834,GME," The VW squeeze and GME squeeze are wildly different situations and aren't comparable.

In the VW squeeze there were only a few parties and, at the end, everyone could see each other's cards. Porsche popped up showing it had 74% stake, and it was known that about 25% of the remainder was in a state pension fund, VW itself, and hedge funds, which left about 1% float to cover about 13% short interest. Porsche boomed them good.

Now, with GME? Hundreds of different hedge funds all playing shell games, millions of investors buying and selling stock in and out, some stockholders cashing in their holdings while the tide is high. It is far from clear how much stock is available and how many shorts are still exposed. Even if we knew the short interest number well, that's just an average over all shorts. Some hedge funds might be hedged to the tits and will be fine, others might have papered over their shorts. We definitely caught the bigger ones like Melvin out, and I tend to believe they bled money to get out of their positions. Why would they lie about that to their investors if there was a strong chance they were going to get boomed again this week?

3837,DD,"  I'm not a financial advisor nor am I smart in any of this at all. Do your own DD.
Here's a theoretical analogy or something. Just try to understand the parallels to the stock market.

TL;DR 🚀🚀🚀 💎🙌 

Let's say I borrowed all the houses at $100,000. I sell them right away (that's a shorting, i made money off of the current price it's at and the only logical reason for that is to buy it back at a cheaper value and pocket the difference). I do this so many times that I've actually got investors lined up for future houses that haven't even been built yet, they don't even exist (naked short). I decide to borrow the houses that don't even exist yet.

A bunch of college kids decide to all buy the house because they like the houses and are going to live in it (that's you). They like these houses so much they decide ""these are really undervalued! We can sell them for $150k"".

I freak out, knowing that i would lose 50k on top of paying back the original 100k of the house, I change the ads for the houses and say ""noisy neighbourhood, college kids, parties, hard to maintain cleanliness blah blah blah"" (smear campaign).

People like the houses so much that it goes up in value. I'm paying interest on all the houses i borrowed at the current market value. Instead of admitting I fucked up and taking the losses, I decide to take the L on the interest.

The best thing I can come up with is to go back to the ads, and say ""no plumbing, roof needs repair, damages all over"" (short attack, market manipulation btw). The value of the houses go down, but the people that have already owned these houses see that there aren't such issues. They go and check out these other houses and it turns out, they're all in the same condition, but all the houses are in the same condition. They buy the houses that don't exist yet. Now I'm really fucked. I'm doing whatever I can to try to drive these prices down. ""Hey look, that neighbourhood has really good houses! Those ones are gonna really blow up in price in a couple of years (media manipulation, bots), little do the people know, I actually own those houses (SLV omegalul), and when they buy, i have more money to try and get out of the situation I got myself in. Monday comes and I have money now, I'm ready to buy back the houses I owe! But.. Nobodies selling them. Not even the one's that don't exist. At this point I'm trying to do whatever I can to drop prices to try and freak people out so I can buy and pay off my borrow, as well as pay off my interest.


If my funds get too low, I'll be forced to pay what I owe before I go bankrupt, they'll liquidate my assets (my other houses) and throw it into the houses that I borrowed, which the homeowner can set the price of because there's no other house to buy.


My dilemma is if I buy at their asking price, the other houses will ask for more, so it only benefits me to buy their houses when I've made them think that they're not as valuable as they think it should be.

In this scenario I'm a hedge fund in short interests. It only benefits me if you sell.",eyendall,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lag1d3/why_gme_short_interest_appears_to_have_fallen/glp2s73/,0.104,0.818,0.078,-0.932

I think the answer is that Gamestop has at the very least a bit of a lifeline until the next console gen (~7 years). If they pivot from most of their revenue from game sales to hardware, or if at the very least they are able to match any and all digital sales (ie what they are doing now where they sell codes that are used to redeem on consoles) and convince enough consumers to continue purchasing those through them (main incentive being accumulating points in the reward program), I can see them at least surviving the next decade.

3862,HE," I keep thinking of that scene in The Big Short where Burry is fucking freaking out as he's -197%.

He talks to one of his employees and he says something like:

""There's a possibility that we're working in an entirely fraudulent system""

and the employee says 

""Or you're wrong""

Here's the thing. HE was the one shorting in that situation, and paying the interest. HE thought the system would react the way it was supposed to.

In our situation, the hedge funds made their play *under the assumption it was a fraudulent system.* They continue to pull grosser and grosser moves to maintain that fraudulence.

Remember on their big whiteboard right now, last week they wrote ""-53%"".

If you believe that what we're doing is correct and will work, just hold on. We don't have the pressure of interest payments slowly crippling us, they do.

.

There WILL be a second wave. Mark my fucking words. Its almost inevitable. There are 8million people on here. And restrictions on trading stops on Thursday. Thats when the doors open and the “domino-effect” will flood the gates. 

Now imagine, Amc goes up even to just 15$ by thursday or 20$, and gme goes to 150$... well guess the fuck what.... alll these people are gonna rally for that and all those people who ARENT holding are gonna have ptsd and jump back in creating a giant domino effect that will blow these stocks to fucking pluto. If/WHEN there is a second wave... Its Game fucking Stop for Wall st. Game over. Let me explain. 

What happened with GME is the true meaning and power of unity. It defies logic period. The power of the people will always defy logic. That is how we fucking evolved. Now logic was put in place to keep us in fucking place, and look where that got us. When RH and all those other mofos who tried to save their asses decided to shut it down the whole fucking WORLD that wanted to get in couldnt. So what happened? They hunted down how they could and acquired a mass amount of knowledge. They entered into the stock market for the very first time. And sadly all these OG crusty stock people tried to explain to them that gme and amc is not logical and they should follow the “smart investment strategies” the hedgefunders would love for you to believe. That is a fucking illusion my friends... Because like i said what happened, Defies logic. Peri-fucking-od. So quickly they all realized after they were put on a leash that yes “long term” “smart investing” makes sense. And it does. And i encourage it. But the GME effect proved that we couldnt give a fuck about a couple k in x amount of years. We need money right the fuck now. And so together we can get it. So know that that is always still gonna be on the back of their minds. What they need is a restoration of faith and a proof that financial unity does in fact work and gme was not a one off thing. So mark my words.... when there will be a second wave... its game over for wall st and its game over for logic and we will prove it time and time again. Together we can solve a huge financial crisis. And yes some will win some will lose, that is life, but as long as we trust one another to help us rise up (no shame in selling at a win and buying back in to hold for you fellow man/woman/other) we can acheive fucking anything. If any of yall were out on the streets in 2020 then you know exactly what im saying. 

With that. 

Hold the fucking line and realize there are bigger and darker things in the works by those up top. Even people like Elon are puppets. We all need each other to realize only together free can we all be free. We cut off our strings. This is just the beginning and every single person here and in the world deep down feels the same.

All of us have been feeling the ups and downs of this ride and, to be honest, don't forget where it all started and how far we've come. And by 'we' I mean the people who like this stock. 

Big hit today, right at the opening. Following this, I had the urge to open reddit and post for the 1st time to make it all clear for you, who obviously feel the doubt about the strategy. Don't feel bad about it, it's normal. You're stading against powerful people who want what we have and will do anything to get it -- starting, as we see, by lowering the prices and targeting stop losses (that you should've canceled already by this time). 

But, just in time of Mark's Cuban AMA, I will spoil the message in his own words:

#  «If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.»

This is the message, this is what I want to say to every single of you retards who are in doubt. It's not all fun and games. Some suits are fighting not to lose billions. We,  the people, are disrupting the market. You thought it would be easy? 

They are doing everything they can to get those shares in your pocket, that's the only way to cover their naked ass. When people have been saying to **HOLD** this is precisely what they fucking meant. **TO FUCKING HOLD**. **THIS IS THE MOTHERFUCKING BATTLE. PEOPLE DON'T SPAM IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S COOL TO HOLD. NO, IF YOU WANT THOSE FUCKING TENDIES YOU CAN'T LET SOME WALL STREET CORRUPT TRASH PARASITE TO COME AND TAKE IT FROM YOUR HANDS. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO GOT CAUGHT HOLDING THEIR PANTS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL AFRAID AND SELL. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD - AND ARE - FUCKING DESPERATE.** 

You genuinely think that if they weren't scared all of this circus would've happen? 

Hold your shares, and, if you can, buy some more. Volume is low, price is in discount. We still have the cheese in our hands. Plus (and correct me if I'm wrong because, you know, I'm a retard as well) they still have contracts to cover. I'm confident we might see the price to rise again today. But even if it doesn't, who cares? You don't pay interests to cover, **patience is key.** Citing Cuban again (damn it feels good): ***«Patience. Disruption is never easy or straight line».***

Guys, one last word: this is the epic journey people have been speaking for months. It's starting to spike (remember VW chart, i.e.). Today we are experiencing one of their last attempts to buy shares from the ones who panicked. This is why people keep yelling to **HOLD!** This is why you should not invest with money you might need, because you don't know how much time you'll have to **HOLD!** This is why you have to know your risk tolerance, to **FUCKING KEEP HOLDING**.

This site, [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) , has a great deal of data on the COVID pandemic. If you take a look at the U.S. you can see that the new daily infection rates are finally heading in the right direction, presumably due to the vaccine rollout. You can also click on the second tab and take a look at individual states, of which, the large majority are also heading in the right direction.

Why do I bring this up? Well, if infection rates continue to decline like this, we could see a ""return to normal"" by the summer time, which also means, a return to the movies. Is that a guarantee? No, but there's probably a lot of pent up energy to get out and do stuff, even if it is just going to the movie theater.

3986,GME, I suspect the real reason why Robin Hood and other brokers had to stop the buying is because they were worried that they wouldn't have sufficient capital to put down as collateral at the clearing house because firstly so many people were buying on margin and secondly the clearing houses got worried so they raised collateral requirements. Also remember that if GME reversed and went down customers on margin could end up in debt to Robin Hood that they might be unable to collect on... If Robin Hood went bust on this then clearing houses would have to fork up. So they raised collateral requirements that then triggered the domino effect throughout the brokerages.

2. Not sell and get on the rocket to escaping your miserable life

Because they know they can win because they know deep down you are a big pussy and these numbers scare you. All you have to do to not fuck this up is hold. They have money and experience on their side. You have math and cold hard facts about the inescapable position they put themselves into. Just fuckin hold!!

COHEN sees a total addressable market cap of over $200B next year and wants to eat into that starting with a $7-$9 Billion nostalgia player in the field.  He's all about ecommerce and even addresses re-selling digital download games.  He's a very wealthy multi billionaire with a very sharp vision for this company and he's all on board.   All of this publicity is only going to translate to him and his team kicking astronomical ass this year.  I can't wait to get actual updates from the new board on where this company is going.

All of us have been feeling the ups and downs of this ride and, to be honest, don't forget where it all started and how far we've come. And by 'we' I mean the people who like this stock. 

Big hit today, right at the opening. Following this, I had the urge to open reddit and post for the 1st time to make it all clear for you, who obviously feel the doubt about the strategy. Don't feel bad about it, it's normal. You're stading against powerful people who want what we have and will do anything to get it -- starting, as we see, by lowering the prices and targeting stop losses (that you should've canceled already by this time). 

But, just in time of Mark's Cuban AMA, I will spoil the message in his own words:

#  «If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.»

This is the message, this is what I want to say to every single of you retards who are in doubt. It's not all fun and games. Some suits are fighting not to lose billions. We,  the people, are disrupting the market. You thought it would be easy? 

They are doing everything they can to get those shares in your pocket, that's the only way to cover their naked ass. When people have been saying to **HOLD** this is precisely what they fucking meant. **TO FUCKING HOLD**. **THIS IS THE MOTHERFUCKING BATTLE. PEOPLE DON'T SPAM IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S COOL TO HOLD. NO, IF YOU WANT THOSE FUCKING TENDIES YOU CAN'T LET SOME WALL STREET CORRUPT TRASH PARASITE TO COME AND TAKE IT FROM YOUR HANDS. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO GOT CAUGHT HOLDING THEIR PANTS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL AFRAID AND SELL. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD - AND ARE - FUCKING DESPERATE.** 

You genuinely think that if they weren't scared all of this circus would've happen? 

Hold your shares, and, if you can, buy some more. Volume is low, price is in discount. We still have the cheese in our hands. Plus (and correct me if I'm wrong because, you know, I'm a retard as well) they still have contracts to cover. I'm confident we might see the price to rise again today. But even if it doesn't, who cares? You don't pay interests to cover, **patience is key.** Citing Cuban again (damn it feels good): ***«Patience. Disruption is never easy or straight line».***

Guys, one last word: this is the epic journey people have been speaking for months. It's starting to spike (remember VW chart, i.e.). Today we are experiencing one of their last attempts to buy shares from the ones who panicked. This is why people keep yelling to **HOLD!** This is why you should not invest with money you might need, because you don't know how much time you'll have to **HOLD!** This is why you have to know your risk tolerance, to **FUCKING KEEP HOLDING**.

GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next

Hello all,

If you don't recognize my name then perhaps you haven't seen my posts at the start of all this. You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.

Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.

But what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.

Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.

One of two things can happen to these people:

1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able
2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.

This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.

So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.

Now, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**

If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?

Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.

If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.

Another question to consider:

If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.

The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.

Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.

Now, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:

1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.
2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.

**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.

I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.

**EDIT:** For people claiming the liquidity defense, please tell me why trading on TSLA was not blocked during its insane short squeeze. If that sounds aggressive I'm sorry, I'm truly trying to find an answer to this question. 

**EDIT2:** This all speculation, no one knows what comes next, no one. We just do our best to guess.",gfazojay,23,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lav53w/down_400k_today_alone_didnt_sell_yesterday_sure/glqf0yf/,0.107,0.788,0.105,0.2799

That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.

I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.

**EDIT:** For people claiming the liquidity defense, please tell me why trading on TSLA was not blocked during its insane short squeeze. If that sounds aggressive I'm sorry, I'm truly trying to find an answer to this question.

4240,ON," So a lot of the newbies and paper hands are getting spooked by the decreasing price, but it's not a bad thing because the volume of stocks traded are the same. At the end of the day, those stocks are owed to investors by the short-sellers irrespective of the price. The fact that there are virtually no stocks to be traded apart from the ones being traded to each other (i.e. inducing ladder attacks) is where the problem lies for them.

That is the key point; hedges still need to buy the stocks to close their over-shorted positions. A low price is instrumental in allowing people to buy stocks back and will enable those who missed the first spike to get back into the game. With everyone being able to buy stocks at a lower price, we may have the firepower needed to re-commence the buying of stocks and finally induce the MOASS due to their heavily shorted positions.

&#x200B;

**THIS IS WHY THE NEWS IS SO ADAMANT ON SAYING THE REDDIT ARMY HAS MOVED ON; THEY DO NOT WANT INVESTORS TO BUY IN AT A LOWER PRICE AGAIN BECAUSE THEY ARE THEY ROYALLY SCREWED**. All their efforts will have been in vein and there will be even MORE longed stocks that are owed, thanks to investors who bough at that dip. This is why it is important to hold.

4262,GME," What’s confusing? Who is out. The number is still over 100%. Go look at the cost to borrow GME right now. The funds are ready to bleed based on that number rather than hemorrhage by covering the full position at the top.  The VWAY squeeze happened with a 12% short interest. Piggly Wiggly squeeze happened with closer to 60%. This is GME this over 100% this is MOASS. 

All of it is bullshit until the shelf offering that was agreed upon in Q4 comes out. That shelf is going to save the shorts. That’s Ryan Cohen’s ace in the hole. The shorts know there is a way out and it is through the shelf and to some extent Blackrock/fidelity or possibly the SEC stepping in.

It’s the Art of War, you leave your enemy and escape path so you know which way they will retreat. This isn’t over until the shelf comes out.

4266,GME," They really are only LOSSES when you sell. We all know the fundamentals of the squeeze haven’t changed for the shorts, that they are playing a shell game with their positions, that they are manipulating the media and constricting buying but not selling and that they finally got their shit together today. We also know these are all artificial events they finally managed to coordinate effectively enough.

We also know the stock is hella volatile and it could be all over the map tomorrow, offering freaked out people time to exit. BUT all my people bought at the $220 dip, and tomorrow if people did that enmasse, we’d be on our way up again.

There has never been a hype on a stock like this in history. It’s just PSyops warfare at this point. GameStop is the worlds most famous brand right now. It’s a bubble but not in a traditional sense, at least that it rests on basic math that’s irrefutable. Plus in this ‘bubble’ the more people who see the hype and get in at bargain prices the greater upward pressure on price.

I’m not happy it dropped so low, but also not scared by their tactics. The stock will be bouncing around all week, or it could drill to the earths core. They aren’t losses until you sell. I can very easily see GME rocket in the next week on any shred of good news. I think that’s equally possible. This whole experience has been too unifying and wonderful. It sucks to be down but we will be higher again as well.

I believe it’s equally plausible the stock may hit $50 as it will hit $300.",Boomslangalang,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laecr5/volume_has_not_increased_enough_to_cover_shorts/glonsbe/,0.101,0.798,0.102,0.0878
4267,GME," **MIDDAY SUMMARY**

Another ladder attack this morning but we weren't surprised, we saw it coming so we HELD like good APES. You can tell when they've finished a ladder attack because the price of GME comes straight back up.

**WHY IS THE PRICE NOT SKYROCKETING BACK UP TO $200+?**

Basically loads of BROKER BITCHES have placed limits on how much you can order. This then indicates that the demand for GME is very low, hence why the price plummets. These BROKER BITCHES and HEDGE FUCKERS know that true demand for GME is very high. I believe that true demand for GME right now is at least 500,000 people. If the average investment across these 500,000 people is $1,000 that's $500,000,000 worth of demand in a few hours. That would skyrocket the price of GME. The BROKER BITCHES and HEDGE FUCKERS know this, that's why they restricted buying. Unfortunately for them, APES do HOLD!

**WHAT'S OUR GAMEPLAN**

Buy when you can and keep HOLDING. Even Mark Cuban said to do the same thing. Switch BROKER BITCHES if you need to and remove any stop losses.

**HOW LONG UNTIL 🚀🌓**

I think Thursday but it really depends of BROKER BITCHES keep placing limits, if they do, then it could take longer.

**REMEMBER THIS**

If those HEDGE FUCKERS were out of danger right now there wouldn't be any buying limits on GME. It's that simple! They are shit scared 😍

When has Wall St ever cared about retail investors? The answer is never. They didn't care in 2008 and they sure as hell don't care now. MSM has never cared about us and they never will so just keep ignoring them.

THE SHORT SQUEEZE HASN'T HAPPENED YET BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO BUY!!!!!!

**TLDR**

Once people are able to buy GME again in normal quantities, GME's price will skyrocket and APE will go to MOON. Just keeping HOLDING APES

Hear ye hear ye! You pirate degenerates!

Do I have a fucking treasure map for you.

First off I want to congratulate all you smooth brain apes out there for the progress on GME (AMC youre cool too) for the squeeze will be squoze and all its juices suckled up for your wives boyfriends to enjoy!

Its only a matter of time and time is why I bring you all ti feast your eyes on FISV.

But ""why FISV?"" What does that have to do with time? You ask?

One only needs to be a completely autistic baby with a concaved Fontanelle bone to see that Melvin Captial is buying time with its position in FISV.

Here let me explain...

What is Fiserv besides a horrible company name and complicated business model that only yacht owners understand?  ...its fucking portal banking with AI.  Thats right a company currently valued at $71 billion is doing what banks should do but doing it for them but for a ridiculous price and less manpower.  Don't believe me? Watch this as Louie Andersons cousin explains how FISV is making bank on handing out money from the Cares Act for BANKS, wtf?

How is this company worth that much? Because institutional investors and the fact where Melvin over bought shorts on GME they over bought calls on FISV causing its artificial inflation.

Melvins largest position as of Jan 30th, 2021 is FISV with 10.54 million shares, but who cares right? WRONG DIPSHITS.  Melvin also has 6.26 million (the largest call position I've ever fucking seen) in calls and as the pressure on GME continues Melvin is forced to liquidate its largest position first to maintain portfolio diversity because bitches love diversity.

So Melvin is funding this GME fight with its call options of FISV and all the hedge fund buddies are helping push the stock price up.  

It only takes a retard to see the lack luster volume on FISV during the day with the stock price moving in trend up as GME goes down. You can almost inverse the graph and over lap it but ill leave that for you fucks because I'm lazy and want easy money. All of that day rally on no news is to be followed by an immediate high volume sell off at the end of each trading day this past week like clock work. Check it out yourselves.

This will not end good for FISV as all this stock churning upwards will eventually come down when the squeeze is on.

So get your sea legs and happy rough seas!!

So, let’s just rewind a few days.

Thursday, they executed a ladder attack, trading large stock holdings between themselves, gradually lowering the offering each time. What did this do? Trick the market algorithms into thinking there was a mass sell off! Was there really? Fuck no. Did we sell? Fuck no! Did we hold? Fuck yes! 💎🤲🏻💎🤲🏻

In the hours following their futile attempt of BLATANT ILLEGAL MARKET MANIPULATION, the stock rose again to +300, an honest representation of the situation, because none of us retards sold!!!

The corrupts at wall street have had the entire weekend to think of a strategy to keep us at bay. Trying to create hype about silver to distract us, using their media contacts to distort the narrative, scaremongering... has it worked? Fuck no!

What they are now doing is using a reduced form of laddering to keep the main stocks at bay. In other words they will continue to trade between themselves at a level that will keep the stock stagnant. This will be a futile attempt to deceive us that the game is up (excuse the pun) and that the squeeze is over.

People, the squeeze is just getting started! It has barley begun!

They will do EVERYTHING in their power to come out on top. The amount of blatant illegal acts they committed last week proves this. There are literally no rules they will not break on their quest to cause panic and ultimately get us retards to sell our stock.

They are continuing to drive the price down now aftermarket in attempt to create further panic so that people sell tomorrow. This is exactly what they want. DO NOT FALL FOR IT!!!

HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART;

No matter what people say, what you hear in the media or any other form of bullshit distraction...

THEY CANNOT CLOSE THEIR POSITIONS UNLESS WE SELL. Simple as that. It’s mathematics. The short float is more than the physical amount of existing shares. Bottom line.

They can’t get out of this without buying the shares back. And who controls the price at which the buy back? WE DO!

Everyone just take a step back, chill out, block out the noise and absolutely 100% hold every bit of stock you own.

We are winning here. It really is that simple. If everyone can stay cool and follow this advice, we got this.

Please upvote, share etc. Don’t care about karma or anything this is far more important. The message needs to be spread so that we can do what’s necessary and finally get ours. We’ve spent too long being oppressed by this corrupt system. It’s time for change.

TLDR; 💎🖐🏻🖐🏽🖐🏿

The goal of the hedge funds here is very clear. They’ve lowered the stock price to drive you into despair. As the price now increases (potentially back up to $300 by end of day) they are hoping you will sell when you hit your buy in. This is a strong play for them because it plays on natural human instinct.

In reality, they are still in deep trouble and they need you to sell. You shouldn’t think of holding today as any different than when you were holding last Friday.

The hedge funds are losing REAL money. They are losing interest on their shorts.

You are seeing theoretical losses. They materialize when you sell.",drdiggz,273,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/layuxv/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_02_2021_part/glr14pm/,0.116,0.736,0.148,0.7031

4436,IT," To everyone who is panicking, the following words are for you:

All of us have been feeling the ups and downs of this ride and, to be honest, don't forget where it all started and how far we've come. And by 'we' I mean the people who like this stock.

Big hit today, right at the opening. Following this, I had the urge to open reddit and post for the 1st time to make it all clear for you, who obviously feel the doubt about the strategy. Don't feel bad about it, it's normal. You're stading against powerful people who want what we have and will do anything to get it -- starting, as we see, by lowering the prices and targeting stop losses (that you should've canceled already by this time).

But, just in time of Mark's Cuban AMA, I will spoil the message in his own words:

«If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.»

This is the message, this is what I want to say to every single of you retards who are in doubt. It's not all fun and games. Some suits are fighting not to lose billions. We, the people, are disrupting the market. You thought it would be easy?

They are doing everything they can to get those shares in your pocket, that's the only way to cover their naked ass. When people have been saying to **HOLD** this is precisely what they fucking meant. **TO FUCKING HOLD**. **THIS IS THE MOTHERFUCKING BATTLE. PEOPLE DON'T SPAM IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S COOL TO HOLD. NO, IF YOU WANT THOSE FUCKING TENDIES YOU CAN'T LET SOME WALL STREET CORRUPT TRASH PARASITE TO COME AND TAKE IT FROM YOUR HANDS. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO GOT CAUGHT HOLDING THEIR PANTS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL AFRAID AND SELL. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD - AND ARE - FUCKING DESPERATE.**

You genuinely think that if they weren't scared all of this circus would've happen?

Hold your shares, and, if you can, buy some more. Volume is low, price is in discount. We still have the cheese in our hands. Plus (and correct me if I'm wrong because, you know, I'm a retard as well) they still have contracts to cover. I'm confident we might see the price to rise again today. But even if it doesn't, who cares? You don't pay interests to cover, **patience is key.** Citing Cuban again (damn it feels good): ***«Patience. Disruption is never easy or straight line».***

Guys, one last word: this is the epic journey people have been speaking for months. It's starting to spike (remember VW chart, i.e.). Today we are experiencing one of their last attempts to buy shares from the ones who panicked. This is why people keep yelling to **HOLD!** This is why you should not invest with money you might need, because you don't know how much time you'll have to **HOLD!** This is why you have to know your risk tolerance, to **FUCKING KEEP HOLDING**.

4522,GME," I bought the stock at 86 (32 shares to 21 shares because my shares got sold due to being margin account and company buy back apparently), watched it plummet from 300+ to 120 now. Thing is I knew this was going to happen. My gf ought amc at 14 and now shes pissed and panicking, I assured her everything will be fine.

My thoughts are currently not organized right now and I'm just blurring out words as much as I can before they fade into oblivion, but I gave it some thought on why I holding.

1. I've seen it rise and fall and (hopefully have) understood its potential. If what people say in here (especially Mr Cuban) are true I expect to see it go back up again to at least 250. Though I have reasonable doubt it'll go to Uranus.
2. If this GME thing falls, we all lose and probably things go back to normal, us plebs will be sitting here bitching and moaning about the unfairness and WS gets their last laugh. The logical choice for me is to sell now and still make some profit albeit not as much, but that would go against everything I believed in since I joined WSB, and I believe all you apes can evolve and kick HF ass and take back what belongs to you.
3. I believe when the whole corona virus thing is over, everything shoot back up, and especially because of how much support the relevant generation is showing, I believe its going to bounce back even more.

In conclusion, hold. At least I know I will.

GME now represents a movement and that movement is valued at far higher than these artificial dips. To those who have already taken profits; we open the door back to you to push this higher. To those still holding; diamond hands for days. The height of this movement is only limited by ourselves.

YOU KNOW THE GAME.

YOU DONT SELL WHEN YOU ARE DOWN.
YOU ONLY BUY.
THIS WAS EXPECT.

YOU SELL NOW YOU ARE NOT THE GOOD KIND OF RETARD. YOU LOSE IN THE WKRSR WAY POSSIBLE.  LITERALLY GIVING AWAY STOCKS TO THE ASSHOLE WHO TRIED TO RIG IT TO MAKE MILLIONS/BILLIONS.  

YOU HOLD LIKE A GOOD RETARD.  WAIT FOR THE SQUEEZE THST WILL COME SOON.  THEY ARE DRAGGING IT OUT.  JUST HOLD.  BUY IF YOU CAN.  IF NOT GO PLAY SOME VIDEO GAMES.

THESE STOCKS ARE WORTH FAR MORE THAN 1K. 
THESE STOCKS HAVE POTRNTIAL TO GO ABOVE 5K.
HISTORY SHOWS HIGHEST SQUEEZE WAS 36K.
GME HAS POTENTIAL AND THE NUMBERS TO GO ABOVE 36K

IF YOU CAN'T TAKE THE RED.  JUST CLOSE THE APP. GO DO SOMETHINF ELSE.  SERIOUSLY FORGET ABOUT IT.  ONCE IT HITS SKY HIGH YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT.  UNTIL THEN DONT TOUCH YOUR STOCK!!!!

THIS ISN'T FINANCIAL ADVISE.  BUT THIS IS MORE LIKE COMMON SENSE. 
DONT SELL BECAUSE YOU LOST.  YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE IF YOU SELL.

THE MATH.  THE EVIDENCE AND THE GAME IS ON OUR SIDE.

HEDGIES AND THEIR DIRTY TRICKS ARE AGAINST US.

OUR ONLY WAY TO WIN IS TO BUY LOW. HOLD UNTOL WE BREAK PAST 1K.

I LIKE THE STOCK.
I'M A RETARD.  DO WHAT YOU WANNA DO.

4759,GME," PER MARK CUBAN

Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand.  They created a RobinHood Dive.  No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers.  Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.

Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls.  When that margin call happens, its brutal.  They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.

That then accelerates the selling.

Which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particular


So what to do ?

If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold.  I dont own it, but thats what i would do.

Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.

I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.

I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.",Alternative-Stuff375,34,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lat43j/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_02_2021/glqmb3o/,0.16,0.771,0.069,-0.985

4884,GME," I think that a drop like this probably shook out a lot of people who bought in high, who were most likely composed heavily of outsiders. People jumping in for a quick profit. The people that we have left are rocks. They aren't moving - 

We who bought in early and are probably still up.

We who bought in late but have earned 💎✋🏼 badges.

In other words, all that's left is the A team. And an opportunity for 🦍 young and old to join the fight at a much lower price.

We are $120 down from $400. We can go lower, sure, but will it make a difference? Will people who were down 100% and held suddenly sell at -120%? I don't think many will.

And besides all that, GME at this price point seems like a pretty good buy to me. On top of all the positive news that led to this shindig, we have lots of new customers who likely lead to at least 1-2 earnings beats. Plus strong potential for a squeeze.

4913,GME," Also this is psychological warfare. They are in loss mitigation mode. They may well be thinking that by driving the price down they will instill such fear and frustration that when it hits $300 again, everyone will just sell to recoup their money and they avoid the squeeze up to $1k or $10k or whatever. I wouldn't be surprised if they keep pushing the price down tomorrow and then we have a runup on Thursday just like last week, maybe they let it go to $300 to trigger people wanting to recoup, before driving down the price again. How much frustration would it cause to have multiple false starts to the squeeze? I bet they can do that for multiple weeks, mitigating their short losses while also betting on the slide down. This isn't to discourage you into selling, but rather to encourage you to take a long view. Take a Xanax, stop looking at the market unless you are buying the dips, set an price alert on your phone at $500k GME and otherwise just forget about your investment. Fidelity did a study where they looked at various classes of investors to see who performed better. You know what kind of investor was found to be the best? Dead people. Dead people don't sell.

4916,OR," Melvin got bailed by citadel once, who’s to say it hasn’t happened many times with other hedge firms coming to the rescue for them? If Melvin did go bankrupt and had to sell their assets, that would drop the overall market, which in turn would hurt the other hedge funds. Plus, if they are doubling down like it’s been rumored to have happened, they could be making much of that money back along with manipulating the price through media.

 I'm retarded and unable to do basic math so idk if it's more cost effective to pump in all at once at a lower price (say $50 at today's close, therefore ensuing the rocket can take off when this massive order comes in), OR average in as the price drops (using media manipulation and short ladder attacks causing retail panic) and therefore no rocket take off because there won't be a mass order? For  all we know, they could be at only 20% short at this point.

4929,GME," At the end of the day this is what determines if you belong here. Do you have the faith, the knowledge and the mental fortitude to trust in the numbers? Do you have the belief that your fellow man will do the same? We've all seen the big short. This is the part of the movie where homeboy Dr. Michael McFlurry Burry stops his investors from pulling out and locks himself in his office. We survive this and we'll be in Valhalla. 

Valhalla is the mythic heaven for those who died in battle. Are you going to be a hero who comes home with the tendies, or are you going to desert and leave your fellow WSB'r holding the slack? The squeeze is inevitable, the HF's that are underwater just want to get out of the position with as little cost as possible. They drive the price down, then they cover. 

We all like to think that we pulled the wool over their eyes, but lets remember these guys are harvard grads who work in one of the most competitive industries in the world. They're not stupid, just greedy. They'll drive the price down as much as possible, and then they'll cover at whatever price they can stomach. The last one to cover on the HF side is going to pay the most. So they're facing the same Game Theory problem we are.
