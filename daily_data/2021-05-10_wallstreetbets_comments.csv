2. VW squeeze was an *entirely* different situation (and time) and is only an example of what *can* happen during a squeeze and has no substantive correlation on the potential GME price point/top
3. If you were going to use VW as a baseline (don't) then it's worth noting VW was at a much higher price before the squeeze vs. VW
4. ""Hype"" has nothing to do with how high the squeeze will reach

...and that's just getting started. In another post below, you seem to be aware of some of the context around the VW squeeze, so I'm struggling to understand how you could post something this retarded.  There are many, many other points of potential evidence you could point to for making an argument why GME hasn't been covered and you decided to go with ""GME more hype than VW""?",gameover2020,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n8r390/gme_t39_tomorrow/gxkg9we/,0.117,0.835,0.048,-0.9486

If you look at the volume of normal trading vs gme when it hit 350 it is ridiculous. (350 on my screen I saw orders on wsb fulfilled @500). VW squeeze shows 60 on Google but you can find orders filled for 1000. Also when this happened gme short intrest was over 100% so this situation is so different from vw I believe it has much more of a ceiling.

Before his return most people just wrote off Apple as x86 was taking over the world, and outside of Education and Content Creation (which in a pre-social media world was basically gated to professionals only) they were losing incredible amounts of market share.  This is in an era where every two years x86 processor speeds were doubling, the PC was still king despite the rise of the internet, and Mac hardware based on PPC chips just could not keep up.  PCs were starting to takeover this market as well.  Audio and Video applications that relied on real-time capture were an absolute mess on PCs for architectural reasons but the raw power of x86 was starting to allow companies to just throw muscle at the issue.  Meanwhile the performance advantages for applications like Photoshop and versions on PC and Mac reaching feature parity made it incredibly compelling to switch.  Apple did not have a bright future.

His return was seen as potentially righting the ship, and was hugely welcome by the Apple faithful.

For one , $150M was more symbolic than anything. Apple was still a multi billion dollar company at the time and the financial problems they were having were not solved by a paltry $150M. 


The deal was important for other reasons. 

For Apple, it was a symbolic gesture from Microsoft that they were not abandoning MacOS. This was very important because if Macs lost the Office suite, it would have been devastating. This was pre-Google docs, there were no widespread alternatives to office. 

For Microsoft, it was important for a couple reasons. 
First, it helped their antitrust issues. ‚ÄúSupporting‚Äù Apple was a way to show they weren‚Äôt being anti competitive. 

At the same time, it bolstered support for Internet Explorer. Every single Mac would ship with Explorer as the default browser. 
Remember, at the time Microsoft was trying to snuff out all browser competition. Netscape was popular on Macs back then. 

So yes, the deal helped Apple and MS, but it didn‚Äôt save them from bankruptcy and the money was an insignificant part of the deal.",trpkchkn,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n90gsv/apple_during_dotcom_bubble_vs_tesla_now_margin/gxmbi3a/,0.073,0.836,0.09,0.3141

225,TSLA," Tesla is a battery company pretending to be a car company. Their cars are subpar for the price, and under-engineered for the duty life we have come to expect from internal combustion engines, with nearly 0 aftermarket OE supply chain which is going to make owning a used out of warranty tesla a nightmare. 

But, I think the real secret is possibly TSLA becoming the amazon of energy. A vertically integrated ecosystem for renewable energy consumption. If they ever figure out the residential solar tech and integrate homes with their power wall Tesla will position itself more like Apple which streamlines the experience within the ecosystem. 

I think the future of energy utilities is decentralized power. Everyone will have battery arrays in their home and they will either soak up generated power from their home solar, or top off intelligently during off peak periods. Then during peak power grid draw times the batteries will siphon back into the system up to the personally allotted amount and help reduce the generation demands to smooth out the curve. Probably end up seeing this incentivized through tax credits and energy bill deductions in the future. I think eventually these types of decentralized home battery systems will replace the megapack and suit a similar purpose.

This is just from the technical standpoint.

Plus every car will need multiple cameras which will exponentially increase the dystopian surveillance state. I mostly hate this ""automated driving"" hype for these kinds of reasons.

If someone gave him 35,000 USD right now - would he invest it in PLTR?

Recently, INOVIO in cooperation with [dwkulp@wistar.org](mailto:dwkulp@wistar.org) posted a preprint of their study highlighting adding nanoparticles to new vaccines developed with INOVIO to fight the variants of COVID-19.

In a nutshell, they developed vaccines that are more effective against COVID-19 variants than than vaccines that simply target the spike protein of the COVID-19 virus.

INOVIO has yet to announce their development of INO-4802 (the PAN-COVID vaccine), however based on this study INOVIO may be very close finishing designing their new vaccines for COVID-19 booster shots.  

This research appears to be very very promising...

Key Points:

\> INO-4800 induced robust T-cell response too all COVID-19 variants (including UK and Brazilian variants).

\> INO-4800 has the same effective powers in generating neutralizing antibodies similar to mRNA vaccines like Moderna.

\> Second generation Pan-COVID vaccine INO-4802 is being developed and is progressing well and upcoming pre-pub  coming out in the near future.

\> Immuno-oncology effort: novel combination trial with PD-1 inhibitor with Regeneron and Sanofi in newly diagnosed GBM is ongoing. The company anticipates sharing 24 month survival data and other data later this year

\> On their HPV trials they have meet their efficacy end points. This is for the management of HPV-16/18 induced malignancies. The findings/data will be shared later this year at scientific meeting. VGX-3100 biomarker will help find patients that potentially will respond to VGX-3100

\> VGX-3100 indications may expand to include anal dysplasia and vulvar dysplasia following further discussion with FDA

\> Financial summary for Q1 2021: Well positioned finally with total cash $111.6 MM. Net proceeds of 162 million from recent offering in february. They have multiple years of capital to support Inovio's many project. RV 371K for Q1. Total operating expnese 52 Million. Net loss for Q1 54.4 Million. Or 27 cents per share. R&D expense 32MM. HIgher drug manufacutring expenses related to INO-4800 and other trials. They also had increased expense from cellectra¬Æ 2000 device and new hire. These expenses have been essential for their INO-4800 trial for covid 19 and their cellectra¬Æ 2000 device. Overall Strong financial position.

\> On track with INO-4800 trial with phase III on track for this summer. This temperature stable vaccine will be important globally.

&#x200B;

Q/A Session:

\> Q1 - Jeff Mecham BoA:  How is the phase III INO-4800 clinical halt going? How does this relate to trial being done outside USA?

A1: Clinical hold on phase III for INO-4800 only impacts USA and not outside of USA. They still plan to open sites in USA but most of the trials will be global. They will apply with FDA during Q1 to lift the partial clinical hold hoping to start in Q2. The goal is global phase III trial and looking with external sources of funding. Not going to Ex-US for cost reasons but they have external links with some countries which do not have covid-19 vaccines and they can do randomized placebo control blinded trials there

&#x200B;

\> Q2 - Ellen -  Looks like you are targeting countries with active Covid-19 and without vaccines. Have you considered non-inferiority trials?

\> A2 - Case driven efficacy window is still open Ex-US.

&#x200B;

\> Q3 - Ellen - Planning on revealing INO-3107 data?

A3 - We received orphan drug designation last year for INO-3107 last year. The most impactful data will be released in 2022. Maybe some meaningful data later this year.

&#x200B;

\>Q4 -  Aydin Huseynov, M.D., CFA Benchmark - We see the data in the pre-publication. Can you commend on Geometric folding?

\>A4 -Antibody levels and impact on vaccine on rise on antibody is important. We feel INO-4800 is equally as good as current EUA approved vaccines in providing protection against COVID-19. Our phase 2 trial shows strong T-cell reponse. Furthermore, the T-cell responese mainted in respond to the new variants. This will be important in providing protection as per our phase III effacicy trial which will start later this summer.

Q5 - Can you see boosting with the INO-4800? What is the medium term view for this vaccine.

A5 - Many experts globally feel like COVID-19 vaccination will require annual seasonal boosting. If they are correct. A vaccine that can be boosted safely and tolerably seasonally over and over again will be important. After the pandemic we will have endemic COVID-XX which will require boosters and INO-4800 will be important to vaccinate people. They can also be used to boost other first generation vaccines that have already been used. INO-4802 is a further generation ahead and will be a pan-COVID vaccine.

&#x200B;

Q6 - E Chan from Wayne Right - Can you tell us if INovio is going to put some of their capital in global Covid-19 research.

A6 - We have over 500 million in cash right now and that is one of our strengths. We want to maintain that and limit our expenses. We are currently are in the process of working with external sources of funding to expand our INO-4800 trial in the US and globally. We are focusing on places where we feel Covid-19 vaccines are needed globally. We will have more information published in the next few weeks.

&#x200B;

Q7 -  Piper Sandler - Can you comment the neutralizing antibody response in comparison to convalence plasma. What gives you confidence the reaction from the investigators and subjects?

A7 - The geometric mean titer presented in the pre-pub shows excellent level of neutralizing antibodies. This is specially apparent for the 2 mg group. The confidence intervals are very strong.

They can also be used to boost other first generation vaccines that have already been used. INO-4802 is a further generation ahead and will be a pan-COVID vaccine.

Q6 - E Chan from Wayne Right - Can you tell us if INovio is going to put some of their capital in global Covid-19 research.

A6 - We have over 500 million in cash right now and that is one of our strengths. We want to maintain that and limit our expenses. We are currently are in the process of working with external sources of funding to expand our INO-4800 trial in the US and globally. We are focusing on places where we feel Covid-19 vaccines are needed globally. We will have more information published in the next few weeks.

&#x200B;

Q7 -  Piper Sandler - Can you comment the neutralizing antibody response in comparison to convalence plasma. What gives you confidence the reaction from the investigators and subjects?

A7 - The geometric mean titer presented in the pre-pub shows excellent level of neutralizing antibodies. This is specially apparent for the 2 mg group. The confidence intervals are very strong.

311,INO," I'd say not priced in.  Price has been steady march downwards due to shorting and waiting for news. I'm a believer so take everything with a grain of salt. Responses below.

Cellectra can be battery operated and is definitely cheaper than building a cold storage logistical solution for many countries. I'm actually excited they have a hardware platform and I think it's undervalued.

#1 - People in US act like COVID is over now. 95% of world needs vaccine. Asia, emerging countries, are a good fit for INO. And even US needs boosters too. So I think investors are chasing other opportunities on false belief that COVID is done.

#2 - check out OP original due diligence.

#3 - people were expecting COVID news the day VGX3100 news came out. Management was excited but news fell flat due to hopes for Phase 2 numbers instead.

I know this was a joke but I really don't see how GME doesn't end up successful. Stock price? Let's say they manage just to get their marketcap to match CHWY at $40bn~ that's a $600 no squeeze. Let's say it takes them 2-4yrs to do so. That's a magnificent return again, with no squeeze. 

Along the way though there will be many squeezes like TSLA.

358,TSLA," lol I thought it was pretty funny but I think the equivalency would be Netflix or Amazon if we are being fair here. 

Mail in DVDs and book sales. Both pivoted successfully into different business models after seeing the writing on the wall. If blockbuster got new activist management, instead of renting moved into streaming ala Netflix they would've been successful. 

Sears? 

I know this was a joke but I really don't see how GME doesn't end up successful. Stock price? Let's say they manage just to get their marketcap to match CHWY at $40bn~ that's a $600 no squeeze. Let's say it takes them 2-4yrs to do so. That's a magnificent return again, with no squeeze.

359,GME," > I know this was a joke but I really don't see how GME doesn't end up successful.

Have you *really* thought about it though? It's easy to just say 'lol be chewy', but easier said than done, and what exactly does it mean when it comes to video games?  Shipping physical games isn't gonna cut it, not with the move to digital.  And before you say something like you prefer physical copies, reddit was full of people saying the same about Bluray. Bluray isn't exactly a failure, but it did fail to live up to expectations, and third party retailers that specialize in selling/renting physical copies were decimated.    

Digital distribution?  Good luck getting control of that from Microsoft/Sony/Nintendo.    Gaming is the worst space to be in for third party distribution.    

Merch? Cool.  PC hardware?  Ok, cool.  Chewy has recurring business at least, people don't buy new motherboards or keyboards every month, and it's also a super saturated market they're late to by 15 years.  That's a lot of catching up to do.  

What else do people usually bring up, LAN centers?  Not very popular in the US.  Esports what?    

Gamestopo doesn't create, innovate, invent, nothing. They're yet another third party retailer in a sea of *very* well established competition. I'm not saying it's game over, but there's definitely tons ways they can be unsuccessful, at least relative to shareholder expectations.",BanzYT,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n8qn9r/chance_the_rappers_deal_with_amc_previews_the/gxli9ij/,0.093,0.692,0.215,0.9871

$1.3B cash in hand as of 12/31/2020, $1B after-tax net income in Q4 2020.

Current quarterly dividend expense is $0.10/share\*100M shares=$10M.

Wholesale channel growing in mortgage market from 20%.

UWMC taking bigger wholesale market share.

Wholesale channel provides the easiest, fastest and cheapest option for consumers, as interest goes up, growth accelerates.

566,UWMC," Yeah, that's my thought process as well.  It isn't about each call you write bringing in serious bank, it's about giving you an additional return on top of the \~5% dividend return.  If it ends up printing, you still got all the previous dividends, plus all previous calls you sold, on top of the profits from it printing at that unlikely price point.  The only risk is that if it rockets for some unforeseen reason way past the $10 strike price you miss out on those extra gains.  But constant repeatable gains are better than a very low chance of serious gains when dealing with UWMC IMO.

$10 per contract at cost basis of 6.80/share, assuming about a 45 day cycle on the contracts, yields almost an extra 12% annual return.",lord_dentaku,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n97drs/undervalued_mortgage_company_uwc/gxnafin/,0.067,0.767,0.166,0.9257

653,GME," Hi there. Thank you. I don't invest in too many stocks. I usually research a couple companies as much as I can and invest if I see value. Nokia is 90% of my portfolio right now. I had 60% of my portfolio in Apple pre-covid  but when Covid hit, I thought ""luxury electronics"" market would take a big hit with large unemployment numbers so I sold it (unfortunately :) ).

Other 5%, I have in AT&T purely for the dividend and that the stock likes to trade between $30-40 and I bought at $31 and will sell if it gets to high $30s. T-Mobile or Verizon  are possibly better plays but I feel comfortable with AT&T and have a good idea about its floor & ceiling. It's not a growth stock but it's a good dividend stock. It has a lot of debt but it's income is good enough to cover the dividend. So, why not? 

The last 5% is on a stock that I have 0 knowledge. GME. That is just because of this sub. :)",Sonerb81,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n93pfz/nokia_a_detailed_review_of_the_company/gxmxcgi/,0.052,0.751,0.197,0.9811

656,CMD," I did briefly but to extend on that comparison Nokia and Ericsson has similar revenues. 

I have to talk about why Ericsson is where it is now before I can claim why Nokia should be within the same ballpark:

Ericsson has been managed well in the 5G era with their new-ish CEO. They really turned the corner so to speak. They have better margins as of now. They have been gaining market share whereas Nokia has been losing some. They have strong foothold in China and Nokia is almost kicked out of it. 

Having said that, Pekka Lundmark mentioned on the CMD that Nokia in many aspects caught up with the competition since his appointment and at the end of 2021, Nokia being behind it's rivals ie Ericsson in the 5G war will be history.

Bottom line is, Nokia has not been managed well under the previous over-promising and under-delivering CEO. Now, Pekka Lundmark is doing great.

(I had to mention why they are not on the same level to show why they should be)  

I mentioned the past, lets mention the present: Things have changed in the last few months. Now Nokia is profitable with strong cash position, positive free cash flow guidance and a very strong balance sheet.  

Plus, as mentioned in my post, Nokia has much more upside potential with substantially higher signed 5G agreements in comparison to Ericsson.

Additionally, Nokia is a leader in the Enterprise market. I mentioned that this market will grow in double digits and is much more profitable than the CSP market. Within a short period of time it will double from about 1.7 billion Euros per year to 3.5 million Euros per year. With double digits OMs, this will propel Nokia's share price to mid to upper $10 range IMO.

When two companies within the same industry have similar revenues and the one with a bigger potential has much lower market cap, I see value. If Nokia was managed properly in the beginning of the 5G era and chose the correct chipset, Nokia would be around $8-9 range right now. There wouldn't be as much value in investing in this stock. It was not and therefore the stock is traded at a discount. That's why I am in Nokia.

If this doesn't answer your question, search my post history and look at my previous Nokia threads.

BASE building projects with robotic building the stations in space. Puting an placing and installing. 
Were looking to build a aprox size 1m by 2mile moon base setup. Preflight to mars staging station. So it obviously starting point earth, to moon base, and then from the moon, again very obvious staging point for preflight setups for distance space flight to Mars Base1 & or & spacestation orbital, and then too a staging area to a flight down to mars. The Orbital Mars (X-Spacestation-X)will orbit Mars, for alot of reasons. It will be allot allot easier. To logistics & transports and Mars Communication Network Center to Earth & Traveling SpaceShips of many designs in the near future! 
Ramp up of NASA hiring welders and electrictions, and metal fabicators to prefab out parts and peices of construction stuff for the stations. 
Robotic building building models. 
Welder Robotics, basicly a multi-tool of 1-4 robotic designs maybe 20 types, robots cargo, and transports of parts and supplies to resupply welders and gas & plasma cutters, self placement pipe robot. 
Wiring robots for power lines and emplacement of the plugins and other control board computer setups instalments.

But yeah. Spacewars. One idea that is freaky to anyone. Unknown outcomes and unknown enemy. Possible enemies and unknown combatant units and armor or ships and size of power weapons that are unknown powers. Super weapons of aliens. Bigger than anythiny we know or is they are so same they are advanced but lack and has serious flaws. We bring a bigger fight, their shit over heats and back fires and blows them up. Backdraft weapon drawback flaw of energy weapons overheat fast. So if they dont know of a cooling device for cooln it down or keeping it cool longer befor it has to sit out of commision tell its fully cooled down. Or it cooks and blows up. Flaws and fixes or is thier a cooling coolant type fix? High energy weapons are advanced and unknown. What they present and what they are not capabile of doing is n question. Are they combustion projectial type or energy beam like a laser or plasma beam blaster? Cutting or what? Energy blast beam power that ignites blast that radiates outwords and vapes everything on the surface? Is it a lightning bolt energy weapon? A flame thrower of unknown gas?

No one has a clue. Is it possible aliens are so more advanced we dont know what to call the weapon type it is. Because they the aliens figured something we cant or couldnt even possibly knew about because of unknown reason and unknown chemical makeup! Mineral mixing process we cant replicate or build yet in a trillion years. Ever. So are we all outmatched by aliens and they are wicked bad ass and capible of enilation at will. And we cant defend from? Probley 100% possible. We could be wiped out in 1min, and that can be simutainulousy attacked and corinated like dots on a map, and be sp smashed and no idea it happened, because we got enilated so dead, so fast. Just dusted in 1sec. Dead. Instant cleaned off the face of earth. Everything cleared and made into ruin and everything is resedued vaped clean on surface. Underground survivors would be best bet to survive an surface elimination event to wipe every thing on the surface off. Bunker undergrounds maybe last bet of survivial would suit survivial of mankind. 
Just sayn. Aliens and weapons of unknown super strengths and thier UFO vechical things. Is like wtf. What is thier plan  goal, wtf are they?

Most of the good part is basicly going to be Robotics Building Machines autonomus A.I. and Remotely controled robotics. 
BASE building projects with robotic building the stations in space. Puting an placing and installing. 
Were looking to build a aprox size 1m by 2mile moon base setup. Preflight to mars staging station. So it obviously starting point earth, to moon base, and then from the moon, again very obvious staging point for preflight setups for distance space flight to Mars Base1 & or & spacestation orbital, and then too a staging area to a flight down to mars. The Orbital Mars (X-Spacestation-X)will orbit Mars, for alot of reasons. It will be allot allot easier.

BUT That idea is scary but thier advancements and unknown weapontry, it would be a serious fast death or one heck of a battle of all out war and blasting constantly. 
But yeah. Spacewars. One idea that is freaky to anyone. Unknown outcomes and unknown enemy. Possible enemies and unknown combatant units and armor or ships and size of power weapons that are unknown powers. Super weapons of aliens. Bigger than anythiny we know or is they are so same they are advanced but lack and has serious flaws. We bring a bigger fight, their shit over heats and back fires and blows them up. Backdraft weapon drawback flaw of energy weapons overheat fast. So if they dont know of a cooling device for cooln it down or keeping it cool longer befor it has to sit out of commision tell its fully cooled down. Or it cooks and blows up. Flaws and fixes or is thier a cooling coolant type fix? High energy weapons are advanced and unknown. What they present and what they are not capabile of doing is n question. Are they combustion projectial type or energy beam like a laser or plasma beam blaster? Cutting or what? Energy blast beam power that ignites blast that radiates outwords and vapes everything on the surface? Is it a lightning bolt energy weapon? A flame thrower of unknown gas? 
So much hotter that it insta-vapes shit to dust?

No one has a clue. Is it possible aliens are so more advanced we dont know what to call the weapon type it is. Because they the aliens figured something we cant or couldnt even possibly knew about because of unknown reason and unknown chemical makeup! Mineral mixing process we cant replicate or build yet in a trillion years. Ever. So are we all outmatched by aliens and they are wicked bad ass and capible of enilation at will. And we cant defend from? Probley 100% possible. We could be wiped out in 1min, and that can be simutainulousy attacked and corinated like dots on a map, and be sp smashed and no idea it happened, because we got enilated so dead, so fast. Just dusted in 1sec. Dead. Instant cleaned off the face of earth. Everything cleared and made into ruin and everything is resedued vaped clean on surface. Underground survivors would be best bet to survive an surface elimination event to wipe every thing on the surface off. Bunker undergrounds maybe last bet of survivial would suit survivial of mankind. 
Just sayn. Aliens and weapons of unknown super strengths and thier UFO vechical things. Is like wtf. What is thier plan  goal, wtf are they? Why weird cattle mutilations and then disapeair like wtf for what reason??? These thouse type aliens are weird.

Most of the good part is basicly going to be Robotics Building Machines autonomus A.I. and Remotely controled robotics. 
BASE building projects with robotic building the stations in space. Puting an placing and installing. 
Were looking to build a aprox size 1m by 2mile moon base setup. Preflight to mars staging station. So it obviously starting point earth, to moon base, and then from the moon, again very obvious staging point for preflight setups for distance space flight to Mars Base1 & or & spacestation orbital, and then too a staging area to a flight down to mars. The Orbital Mars (X-Spacestation-X)will orbit Mars, for alot of reasons. It will be allot allot easier.

No one has a clue. Is it possible aliens are so more advanced we dont know what to call the weapon type it is. Because they the aliens figured something we cant or couldnt even possibly knew about because of unknown reason and unknown chemical makeup! Mineral mixing process we cant replicate or build yet in a trillion years. Ever. So are we all outmatched by aliens and they are wicked bad ass and capible of enilation at will. And we cant defend from? Probley 100% possible. We could be wiped out in 1min, and that can be simutainulousy attacked and corinated like dots on a map, and be sp smashed and no idea it happened, because we got enilated so dead, so fast. Just dusted in 1sec. Dead. Instant cleaned off the face of earth. Everything cleared and made into ruin and everything is resedued vaped clean on surface. Underground survivors would be best bet to survive an surface elimination event to wipe every thing on the surface off. Bunker undergrounds maybe last bet of survivial would suit survivial of mankind. 
Just sayn. Aliens and weapons of unknown super strengths and thier UFO vechical things. Is like wtf. What is thier plan  goal, wtf are they?

BASE building projects with robotic building the stations in space. Puting an placing and installing. 
Were looking to build a aprox size 1m by 2mile moon base setup. Preflight to mars staging station. So it obviously starting point earth, to moon base, and then from the moon, again very obvious staging point for preflight setups for distance space flight to Mars Base1 & or & spacestation orbital, and then too a staging area to a flight down to mars. The Orbital Mars (X-Spacestation-X)will orbit Mars, for alot of reasons. It will be allot allot easier.

So if they dont know of a cooling device for cooln it down or keeping it cool longer befor it has to sit out of commision tell its fully cooled down. Or it cooks and blows up. Flaws and fixes or is thier a cooling coolant type fix? High energy weapons are advanced and unknown. What they present and what they are not capabile of doing is n question.

750,INO," I heard from INO employees directly who felt the FDA were holding them back and I have seen tons of allegations on Reddit and Stock twits but I doubt that FDA corruption is really the cause of delays. I feel it's likely Inovio was slow on the development of their medical device for INO-4800, the electroporation device. This was the source of the hold, ""questions about the cellectra device"" as the FDA put it. Commercialization of VGX-3100 is first in line in their pipeline and that uses a different device than the INO-4800 electroporator. Inovio needs to fully develop and manufacture tens of thousands of these for Covid, many more than a vibrant HSIL treatment business requires.  VGX-3100 wasn't going to demand finished electroporation devices untill 2022 so I think a lot of the delay is to allow for the medical devices to catch up to the drugs.

Additionally the US military funds Inovio and runs their clinical trials on a host of pipeline drugs. That relationship must have lead to confidentiality agreements. This is another reason I dismiss criticism for a lack of communication with shareholders.",Brostradamnus,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n8zrfe/inovio_is_worth_looking_into_ino/gxmii8v/,0.068,0.872,0.06,-0.3458

754,PLTR," Here's my take and it's got a couple of angles.

The first thing is, in my life, I saw a variety of investment opportunities that kind of *spoke* to me. I saw the Iphone and said 'Oh, that's going to change everything.' I saw Netflix and thought the same. I saw a CEO change from one company to another and thought 'Man.. that's gonna be massive.' and I didn't act on any of them because at the time, I asked other people more '*in the know*' than I was and they talked me out of it and their reasons weren't bad.

All of those opportunities could've made me a lot of money but I missed them. None of them were overnight. They all took years to get to their peaks.

PLTR is one of those for me. When I saw it, saw what they do and have done I said 'Oh, yeah, I get it.. this is going to be huge.'.

I just think that any company that can assist multi billion dollar operations in making more billions is itself going to make billions (billy yansen) of dollars. It's really that simple for me.

755,PLTR," PLTR has a moat in terms of what they have built, based on R&D costs. Lots of money and time over the past 10 years. Assuming a company wants to build something similar, it's going to take probably $30-50M in R&D and 2-3 years. That's a pretty big risk.

Even if PLTR wasn't providing a lot of value to customers, they are addressing the setup and knowledge gaps that exist in building inference systems in companies. The fact they provide value as well is just icing on the cake.

793,CC," Covered Calls are easy. You set a strike price for the number of calls you can sell (1 call is equivalent to 100 shares).

The goal of a covered call is to gain premium for selling the call. As such, it is in your best interest that the stock either drop slightly or stays the same. If the calls expire out of the money-meaning the stock did not reach the strike price-then nothing happens. You don't get assigned, don't sell your shares, and you get to keep the entire profit (minus transaction costs).

The other way to gain profit is to close the position early by buying a call. This way you don't need to wait to the expiration to take some profit.

Let's say you had 100 shares of the stock and you wanted to sell a CC at your average price which is 20 dollars. Let's say the contract is worth .80 so selling it would get you 80 dollars into your account. Now let's say that the price falls a little. As the price falls the price for the contracts will also fall. So let's say you expect it to bounce back up a little. Instead of waiting until the expiration, you could buy a call at the lower contract price. Let's say the contract went down to .40. In that case you would pay 40 dollars for the contract and net the 40 dollars in premium. If the stock rebounds, the price for selling a contract would go up and you could sell another.  You could also choose a different strike price or expiration to try and get more profits. 

The only potential problem with CC is if there is a huge run up and you get assigned the contract. If the stock price is above the strike price, then you still have to sell your shares at the strike price. Meaning you would have missed out on some profit. If it is far from expiration and makes a huge run, it still might be better to buy a call to cover-if the profits will outweigh the price you'll have to pay for the contract.

As long as you don't put yourself at too much risk with strikes far below your average, then CC are an easy way to generate profit. Do them enough weeks and something you have lost money on can turn even and allow you to sell at the lower stock price.",danferindustries,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n93btj/is_pltr_really_that_good_of_a_buy/gxn0o6h/,0.079,0.802,0.119,0.9775

832,VIAC," Some will point to debt, but they just paid it down $2 billion, and it‚Äôs only at a ratio of 1.6 or so I believe, a really good ratio is 1.0.. so can‚Äôt really argue debt is an issue. Then they‚Äôll argue that the legacy side of the business is a drag, i.e. cable.. that it‚Äôs on a steep decline moving towards cord cutting... however we can clearly see VIAC is pivoting hard and aggressively, and is leveraging its legacy business into world class streaming services. Others will argue that VIAC is way behind, and they don‚Äôt stand a chance against the likes of Disney+ or Netflix.. and the streaming space is ‚Äúcrowded‚Äù.. how can they hope to capture significant market share... well, again, they are showing us and proving to us ‚Äúhow‚Äù they will... the real bear thesis is VIAC is an old, legacy boomer media ‚Äúcable‚Äù stock, and that‚Äôs because they are only doing a surface gloss over, and not really digging in and seeing that it‚Äôs furthest from the case...

965,MVIS," The fact that Mitsubishi just trippled their position means a lot.
As for the revenue, yes, its low, but is there another lidar company that has revenue that justifies their market cap?? Lazr and Velodyne have same ratios, but they do not have developed technology unlike MVIS. On top Mvis besides lidar has other technology like the one that Microsoft uses in their military contract worth 22Billion.( 500k revenue probably came from 220 mil defence contract Microsoft had in 2017).

This being said, because wsb came at the very wrong time before (3 days prior to announcement) its not likely that shorts would allow price to go up before may options expire, so ideal day is to buy it on May 20th. If buyout is announced on 26 th price is likely to be double of what it is today, if no buyout june 1st you can sell for the same price you purchased, so no really any risk. 

Had shares purchased at 11, so dont care if its trading daily at 14 or 18, looking for 31.73.

1114,DD," Ugh I just can't with them. Not to trash your DD, and you might be right, but I personally will never buy from them again and won't buy their stock either.

I've been buying Old Navy, Gap and Banana Republic for about 20 years and I've noticed a significant decline in quality across the board. I'd say I used to return at least 50% of items I purchase from there before giving up completely. I also find myself donating a lot of stuff I buy from there.

Their sizing is completely wack, I usually need to order 3 or 4 of the same item just to figure out what's going to fit. They're constantly running weird gimmicky sales and rewards system (supercash?) that usually only apply to the deeply discounted janky items that nobody wants. The quality of their fabric has just gotten worse. Hey, maybe this is a business model that works for them but as a consumer it's a dumpster fire.

I will say that the athletic apparel from Gap/ON is dece if on sale. Also sometimes I will buy something from Old Navy if I need an emergency pair of pants for a funeral or something and don't want to spend more than $30.
