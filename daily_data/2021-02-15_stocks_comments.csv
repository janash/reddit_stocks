20,GME," Not sure this example is really showing “pigs get slaughtered”. When I think of that, I think of people chasing stocks that already popped because they think they’ll go higher (tsla, GME, etc), or even holding something that grew 80% overnight, but then it flat for a year, losing money that could have been made on other investments in the meantime. 

It doesn’t mean “sit an hold something just because you don’t need the money”. Sitting on something flat or growing too slow can be a loss. 

If you’re an active investor and you want to lock in profits to move on to the next play, selling at a profit makes sense so you can invest in something else.

My question is I have about $1,000 to start and I know its going to be a process to get familiar and to become decent at this. I am an experience accountant so I do not impulse buy and sell/ analytics are pretty simple to me. I do the DD and read about everything I have purchased so far.

71,HNW," $250k+ JPMC private client is nothing really. That was JPMC trying to get the affluent market with carrots like sign up cash bonuses so that they would eventually be able to cross sell other services like wealth management and products through wealth Management.  They call them private client to make them feel special. 

The private bank client are  the people JPMC are really after as they are HNW and ultra HNW that meet minimum $5 million dollar thresholds  and they mostly have assets managed by JPMC and make quite a bit of revenue there. Private clients are loss leaders and intended to be a funnel for cross selling or private bank when they get more assets. 

Me and my wife have chase accounts that meet private client thresholds  and have been approached a number of times to sign up for private client. I don't see any benefits and see a liability as you have to have some $250k minimum with them at all times.. I keep our money spread across different banks so we don't cross $500k at any point. We keep around 5 to 10% in muncipality bond funds  as dry powder and little cash for monthly expenses. 

Sounds like private bank money would make news if they started going all equities.

72,UK," This is my take as a 28 year old European who has been investing for a while and sits on about 200k cash and 50k shares.

*-> I have liquidated all my positions*

*-> I day trade from time to time since I lost my job, good way to make some cash quick right now with the market volatility*

*-> I avoid swings and long term investments because the market is basically a giant casino right now*

**What is the current situation?**

The current market is grossly overvalued in certain sectors. Tech is absolutely killing it right now, carried by the pandemic which has increased reliance and consumerism in the tech industry, allowing it to flourish and seem like an amazing thing. 

This trend could continue for a while, or it could all end tomorrow, that is the beauty of not knowing the future.

However:

\-> Current market is propped-up by the intervention of the US government printing money like it is going out of fashion. The fact that they can print money and keep interest rates close to 0 is pretty mad

\-> There is a bubble, whether we like to admit it or not, the question is,  will the bubble burst, or will it become the new normal?

\-> What happens when the US government has to stop printing money, or when the over-printing leads to the USD losing value vs the GBP and the EUR? Could be a big issue for US stocks, holding their US monetary value, but actually being worth sustanitally less, especially in a world of global trade

\-> The numbers for unemployment are worse than anticipated

\-> There hasn't been any fallout yet from businesses going bust, small businesses getting into debt, etc. due to the pandemic: this will be huge, and will be the same case in other countries such as Spain, the UK, Portugal, Greece, etc.

\-> The financial cost of Covid-19, the measures put in place and all that jazz will have to be recouped somewhere, so we can imagine new taxes, new taxes on businesses, etc. to try to make up the hole that was created from both bailouts/subsidies and the negative growth of the economy

Conclusion:

The fact that the SP500 is at an all time high, breaking records and tech stocks are killing it, is counter-intuitive of the current global situation. The safe assumption is that the market is artificially propped-up by stakeholders who have an incentive to keep it going as long as possible.

You can still make money in this market, but a crash, or at least a correction, is highly possible, so it is worth re-allocating resources into other types of investment, or holding cash.

Good luck to all, and please don't listen to people on reddit who say ""the world will end"" or ""the market isn't a bubble because Cathie said so"" -> do your research, draw your conclusions, and don't remortgage the house or use student loans to invest (this is never a good idea).",Alpaca_lives_matter,3,/r/stocks/comments/ljxylf/huge_amount_of_cash_among_wealthy_be_careful_out/gniwp06/,0.072,0.818,0.11,0.9186

88,GME," Hi. You are more than welcome. I wish I knew exactly what to do :) I am not the kind of person to Yolo everything on GME, so my advice might be a bit too conservative for you. But here it is...

First and foremost payoff your high interest debt if any (credit cards, etc).  Then build a stash to carry you for 6-12 months. I don’t know your circumstances - if things go to hell and your portfolio is down 40%, will  you be ok?  If you can’t pay your rent, can you crash with your parents rather then selling off your stocks?  Can you wait it out until markets stabilize?  Just make sure you have enough saved up to tie you over until you are back on track. 

After that, given that you don’t have a lot of experience and I am assuming have 30-40 years till retirement, I would say majority vanguard/ETF or some other low fee index fund. Pay attention to fees. But set aside some money to play with stocks and get experience. You may lose a lot of it or not. Who knows. Do your due diligence and see what speaks to you. Definitely have some money you actively manage to gain experience and maybe it will turn into something more lucrative. Or maybe you will get spooked and decide that index funds are perfectly fine.

93,EV," In background, I'm almost 40.  My ship has sailed, and it crashed into the rocks.  I'm 90% sure I'm boned, I'm just trying to give my kid enough of a head start that when she leaves home, the only time she has to come back is for my funeral.

I have no credit card debt, and I'm good on immediate savings.  I'm a dumb hammer monkey, and I've got work under contract for the next three years.  Small time residental stuff, no great danger of losing my paycheck any time soon, no more than anyone else on any given day.  I'm less than 30k away from owning my house, and I've been slowly chipping away at paying that off faster by rounding up my mortgage payments to the next highest hundred.  I have no credit card debt, for richer or poorer, because growing up as a dumb hill jack in WV, I saw alot of folks bury themselves fast, scared the piss out of me, I have one that I keep at zero balance just in case of emergency.

I have enough in savings that, with conservation and frugality, I could do 6 months comfortably, 9 months with a gun to my head.  I have not dipped into that for obvious reasons, my investing capital is seperate and not nearly as substantial.  I currently have positions in an SPAC that has merged two companies I believe will do well in the future, a certain automobile manufacturer who has very unimaginative names in trucks because the entry is low, and I think they'll eventually rise to the EV challenge, and a meme stock phone manufacturer, because I escaped some of the hype, but I remain a deeply, deeply stupid person.  That's 80% of my investment.  The other 20% is bag holding a penny stock because I like the needles and I think it'll go to $3 in a month or two, unless it gets PnD'd again, in which case I'll get out too.

I know I'm gonna work until I die.  I don't have invested, but I'm adding to it, and I'm trying to do better for my kid.

I see many comments in other posts saying “I can easily make 20% a year and retire at 40”. That’s based on what they have experienced in the last 5 years or so. 

I am assuming those Chase private clients are older (40+) and lived through some tougher markets. 

Also, the older you get the less you can afford to lose: mortgage, tuition, looming retirement, aging parents that all of a sudden depend on you.

Honestly, in your case, I would stick with you “gambles” - I have few silly ones as well and who knows where they will take us.

So it might tank with the market but unless it totally goes bankrupt, you will still get dividend return.

131,AMZN," It’s directly correlated with the price of the stock.  No one would be willing to buy your shares of AMZN if the company made no money.   They whole concept of the stock market is that you own a piece/% of a company.  If you own a share of a high earning/high growth company your share is more valueable than a dog shit company that makes no money.   Stock prices are set by investors earnings/growth expectations.  That is why you always see pops/drops on earning reports.  The market is adjusting their expectations/outlook for earning potential and the share price adjusts with it.  

If you understand supply and demand then know that earnings is the demand driver in the story.  People want to own companies with good earnings growth and that demand drives up the prices of those shares since supply is fairly constant (with a few exceptions). 

While you can’t cash in until you sell, it’s still very important because it will dictate your eventual sale price.",Chadd_Farthouse,5,/r/stocks/comments/lk51gr/i_dont_understand_how_earnings_fundamentals/gni1rs5/,0.082,0.794,0.125,0.7778
132,DD," Thankfully this is already easily and quickly calculated for us. It's called ""Shareholder's Equity"". It should be listed on the Balance Sheet. However, be careful, because as most people noted this is based on a lot of accounting assumptions.

The most common assumption is ""Goodwill."" What's the ""brand"" of a company worth? Companies notoriously over value their Goodwill.

Take Blackberry as an example. In 2019, they listed $3.89bn in shareholder equity (i.e. net assets). But of that, they claim their name ""Blackberry"" (i.e. their Goodwill) is worth $1.44bn. I don't know about you, but I would **not** pay $1.44bn to buy the name ""Blackberry.""  Maybe someone else would, I don't know. But the point is this: I'm skeptical of their listed shareholder equity.

As always, this is why a good DD dives into financials and carefully scrutinized them.

If you just throw out an arbitrary number, chance are you’re hoping (speculating) that you’ll reach that number by the end of the year.

183,CC," > How much can you really make selling CC in a 100k portfolio?

more than you can with a 1k portfolio.

numbers wise, my weekly average over the last 24 weeks (when i started doing CC's) is around $250/week. there was one outlier week that bumped my average up from closer to $200/week. mostly i do conservative calls, but occasionally i'll see more aggressive ones that are too much of a return to pass up.

percentage wise, it's a pretty solid return that 1k portfolios would be locked out of.",reaper527,1,/r/stocks/comments/lk16vh/whats_easier_10k_to_100k_or_100k_to_1mil/gnhsuor/,0.025,0.841,0.134,0.8768

when i started selling covered calls, i was at around 50-55k. currently, i'm at about 95k, quickly inching towards the 100k mark (got as high as 98k before a dip last week), plus some margin not included in that number (so the 95-98k is my total value - the margin).

>what positions

i don't necessarily have all of these any more, as some were called away (deliberately in some cases,because like when delta had grown  over 75% from when i bought in, and at the time i was skeptic about it holding that value and  expecting a dip, so i sold VERY aggressive covered calls at like $1 over the current price at the time until it eventually sold. in other cases, just a result of the companies growing more than expected, like when DIS went through the roof the day the first vaccine was announced). that being said, the companies i have sold calls against are:

* AAPL
* T
* HRZN (this isn't really a good company for CC's right now due to low premiums with monthly calls being the only options at prices that seem way too low to justify) 
* IRM (same deal as HRZN, but not quite as bad so i'll check these every week, and sometimes i'll find a premium i'll jump for)

of course, as stated, some of these have gotten called away, so i don't have all those shares currently.

>and what is your typical strike price as a percentage above market?

honestly, i don't pay too much attention to the percentage. i use more of a gut feel weighing the risk/reward. i'll look at the premiums and say ""what do i think the odds are this will go up $x over that time span"" and shoot for the best premium i can get that i feel pretty comfortable with. when doing this, i'll look at the price history for the company to see when the last time it hit that price was and what the trajectory has been. i'd feel super comfortable selling $33 monthly covered calls of T for example when it's sitting at $30/share, but wouldn't necessarily feel so comfortable doing the same thing with most other companies.

another thing i do is keep exdates in mind and make sure that if the call is going to be near an exdate, that i pick a date shortly AFTER rather than shortly before. there's no need to have the dividend hunters artificially spike up the price right before my options expire.

also, sometimes i'll also buy shares with the sole intent of letting them get called away. a recent example is EXPI. i was excited about the company and wanted some shares. the premium for shares $1 over the sell price at the time on a 2 week call was an insane $11/share. i grabbed a stack and immediately did one of those calls. will it hit? sure. will i be making $1200 off of it? yup. (and at the same time i also grabbed 100 shares that i intended to keep, and sold a much more conservative call against that one for like $40 over the current price, which still had a $3/share premium, and honestly, if that gets called away, i'm really not going to be too upset after that kind of profit. that being said i don't expect it to and i plan to hold these and sell calls on for years to come)

>Do you sell weeklies or do biweeklies then buy back at a lower premium on dips?

still kind of figuring that out. i was mainly doing weekly, but the last month or so i have shifted towards biweekly because it's been giving me a higher per week average (for example, maybe on a given company i get 3 cents a share  on weeklies, but 8 cents a share on biweekly which would average to 4 cents a week).

typically for companies that have higher premiums (around $1 if not more), i'm more apt to do weekly calls. for companies in the 1 to 5 cent range, i'm more apt to do bi-weekly or even monthly calls.

>Do you sell weeklies or do biweeklies then buy back at a lower premium on dips?

still kind of figuring that out. i was mainly doing weekly, but the last month or so i have shifted towards biweekly because it's been giving me a higher per week average (for example, maybe on a given company i get 3 cents a share  on weeklies, but 8 cents a share on biweekly which would average to 4 cents a week).

typically for companies that have higher premiums (around $1 if not more), i'm more apt to do weekly calls. for companies in the 1 to 5 cent range, i'm more apt to do bi-weekly or even monthly calls.

honestly, i don't pay too much attention to the percentage. i use more of a gut feel weighing the risk/reward. i'll look at the premiums and say ""what do i think the odds are this will go up $x over that time span"" and shoot for the best premium i can get that i feel pretty comfortable with. when doing this, i'll look at the price history for the company to see when the last time it hit that price was and what the trajectory has been. i'd feel super comfortable selling $33 monthly covered calls of T for example when it's sitting at $30/share, but wouldn't necessarily feel so comfortable doing the same thing with most other companies.

typically for companies that have higher premiums (around $1 if not more), i'm more apt to do weekly calls. for companies in the 1 to 5 cent range, i'm more apt to do bi-weekly or even monthly calls.

if my shares do sell, i always keep an eye on the price and look for a dip to buy them back cheaper than i sold them.",reaper527,1,/r/stocks/comments/lk16vh/whats_easier_10k_to_100k_or_100k_to_1mil/gnjrw0d/,0.034,0.841,0.125,0.997

You’ll likely have to wait until the bond market recovers or the fed increases rates or some other bad news to get MSFT at cheap prices. If you don’t want to wait, just look for where MSFT has support. I too was kicking myself for not being in MSFT earlier.

292,CEO," Here’s the deal. An ETF is a basket of stocks. I like industry specific ones, like oil or pets or whatnot. If the pet business goes up, you go up. 

Stocks are individual companies. Each of them is one company with one management team and one CEO and one board.  If it turns out the CFO has been embezzling funds, you’re done too. If the CEO has been lying in investor calls, you’re done too. If the product turns out to be poisoned, you’re done too. 

But usually it’s just simple competition. If a competitor comes out with a far superior product, your company is in trouble as their market share will drop. Good for you if you happen the guy with the superior product. 

But if you own the sector, then all innovation is good. If any one company goes up, so do you... just not by as much. 

But the bottom line is that if you buy a stock, you are betting that the CEO isn’t murdering hookers on the weekend. If you buy a fund/sector, you’re betting that some CEOs are NOT murdering hookers on the weekend.

The forex market has their own hours too, Tokyo & Sydney open sunday evening, then tomorrow NY forex market will open.

Also to answer your other question:  The futures price always carries over, just like a stock until the futures contract expires and traders start trading the next contract (which they can also do, at any time, trade the next months contract or next year's, etc).

But you're also asking if the futures price (assuming you're referring to equities futures like ES) carry over to the stock market indexes?  Not exactly, the futures price is the price speculators & hedgers believe the index will be worth in the future on the date the contract expires.

So the futures price of ES can be different than the price of the s&p 500 index.  For example ES closed at a different price than SPX did on Friday.",provoko,10,/r/stocks/comments/lk4mzl/futures_are_open_but_the_market_is_closed_tomorrow/gni0ecw/,0.007,0.955,0.038,0.6808

323,PMO," My favourite stock - mostly for sheer potential, and i've been a fan since this company was in serious trouble, buying most of my shares penny price region is £PMO (premier oil). With oil on an upwards trajectory and this company being one of the largest north sea producers it was essentially a debt ridden value trap, however it was saved by another oil producer with a lot of cash looking to expand, furthermore the combined entity looks really promising. The deal means PMO won't exist but PMO shares will be converted into the new shares once the merger goes through and the conversion rate is fairly generous to PMO holders. Think a massive oil producing SPAC with exclusive rights to numerous exploration areas and new oil wells in development as well as 4B GBP in tax write-offs.

Just as a heads up with the new entity we actually see a big oily that is curbing emissions by carbon sequestration (pumping pure CO2 into old oil traps underground) and producing clean Hydrogen fuel for cars and industrial uses e.g. chemical processes such as making fertilizer. Turns out this is hella profitable because you can sell CO2 allowance. 

&#x200B;

Another thing I'm looking at to de-risk my portfolio and hedge into more asset types is Physical silver (PHSP) It has extremely low fees 0.5% which is the lowest i've seen for silver etfs but also has the advantage of that it actually has the silver as opposed to other silver ETFs.  

Oh yeah and Biffa, cba to write much about it but they recycle a lot of aluminium and if you google ""Aluminium solid battery"" you'll kind of get this play. Thing is somewhere around 80% of aluminium is sourced from recycled aluminium, and it only takes 3% the energy to recycle aluminium compared to mining it and processing it from raw plus its cheaper.

361,TV," > Cinemas used to have a significant advantage over 'home theater'.

That's not what people were saying in the 1950s and '60s. They said it was dying. TV was killing it off. Which was true. Tons of screens shut down. Major studios went under (bye-bye RKO), and they were being lead by moguls who were notoriously out-of-touch. It was a huge crisis. But out of that crisis came the most interesting period in Hollywood history, the ""New Hollywood"" of the late '60s and early-mid '70s, as they tried new stuff in search of audiences and a new business model. 

What emerged from that is the paradigm that has only gotten stronger to this day; that of the Blockbuster. Big budgets, targeting younger audiences with stuff that'd previously been B-movie fare (sci-fi, horror films, monster films). 

That paradigm is stronger than ever; mid-budget dramas that was Hollywood's main product in the Golden Age of the 1930s and 40s are virtually dead. Blockbusters are where it's at.

[Bottom line is this](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dABOfuRQR9Q/TmD7lc8-CYI/AAAAAAAAAr8/Ua1fa4rvzmE/s1600/WorldAdmission1930-2010.jpg). The TV _really_ fucked over cinema. But after the 1970s, neither color TV nor VHS nor cable TV nor DVDs lead to any huge decline. On the whole cinema attendance has plateaued in the past decades. That's not great, but it hardly dooms the industry. 

The question for the theaters is how to create growth. Given how streaming has revolutionized the production end of things, there are many possibilities to work on that end. They could also do more to try to bring back the adult market.",mtaw,1,/r/stocks/comments/lk8n4x/amc_is_it_a_company_in_decline/gnk3yh1/,0.072,0.847,0.081,-0.1682

When COVID lock downs alleviate, cinemas have a spike of popularity for nostalgia reasons. But as soon as everyone remembers how expensive it is, the market declines one again. I figure a small period of popularity, 6-12 possibly 18 months max.

The biggest risk of getting shares in either is bankruptcy, but even in that scenario their assets would probably pay back your investment you would assume (given the low share price and numerous assets they must own) edit - shit they rent everything.

But, as I said I have done no DD on either, not aware of their financials.

Just expressing my personal opinion. Currently I have no investments at all but will be investing in ACM at some point as long as DD adds up, hopefully the price drops further by the time I’m buying

Some smart DD would be to look at this https://www.screendaily.com/news/cinema-reopening-dates-around-the-world-latest-updates/5149917.article in the countries like Germany where Cinemas are due to reopen soon, have a look at how the shares perform of the main industry leaders in those countries and see how the shares respond. The only issue with that is not knowing the film market very well in those specific countries, it may take some digging and might not reflect truly what will happen with the US market.

Now looking into ACM a little bit I see they have more theatres open than I originally assumed. 
But still a considerable amount are shut and some which are open have food and drink restrictions. And those which are open are operating at a max capacity of only 40% (following social distancing requirements).

398,AMD," Here are some of my picks that are a bit of a hybrid of value & growth investments:

* **Shimano** (Japanese company. Rock solid fundamentals, dominating in a growing industry. If you ride a bicycle you undoubtedly know that Shimano much owns a really big part of the bicycle component market. Ebikes are booming and in more and more countries/cities bicycles are slowly, but steadily being considered as a legimate form of sustainable mobility (and it doubles as exercise too). In some countries ebikes have been increasing in popularity so much that even some car manufacturers have been developing their own bicycles. Shimano is a stable & well managed company, fairly valued, favourable market trends could benefit this company. Many governments in different countries are proposing tax deductions for the purchase of an ebike to help speed up to transition to sustainable, green mobility.
* **DOMO** (Domo) (data visualization & business intelligence company, with a really, really good product).
* **SNE** (Sony) Undervalued conglomerate that has a large & growing entertainment business (music, TV, anime, movies, gaming), a semiconductor business dedicated to imaging/sensing technology which will undoubtedly play a very important role this decade. On top of their growing entertainment & semiconductor business, their consumer electronics business is doing very well nowadays compared to 5 years ago. They have a low valuation despite very good ROE and forecasted growth in the entertainment, gaming & tech segments of their business) Relevant article to get a small idea at how understated Sony's importance in tech is: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenmcbride1/2020/07/30/how-sony-is-fueling-the-computer-vision-boom/?sh=1bf6091851b2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenmcbride1/2020/07/30/how-sony-is-fueling-the-computer-vision-boom/?sh=1bf6091851b2) ).
* **HEAR** (Turtle Beach) (Currently still an undervalued company despite the gaming boom during covid (gaming boom is obviously not temporary, the video game market has a CAGR of 13%), so this would be a value-based stock pick to profit from the growing video game market & esports)
* **NLS** (Nautilus). Used to be a bit of a struggling fitness equipment company until 2019. Got new management in the middle of 2019. They started to focus more on unique, quality equipment and connected fitness (digital coaching, they introduced a subscription service called JRNY which got pretty good reception). stay-at-home fitness equipment demand has been a huge, huge boon to them obviously, but imho the turnaround of this company actually started before the covid boom if your look at their past earnings reports. Covid just completely accelerated their turnaround. It looks like they're on a very good trajectory now imho and the demand for their products remains sky-high (much higher than 1-2 years ago). Their forward P/E is pretty low at 17. Also, there's pretty high short interest in this stock (20%), those shorts might help drive the stock price up if Nautilus maintains its renewed trajectory.

Sony, Turtle Beach and Nautilus are examples of companies that used to be struggling companies. But they have completely turned their fortunes around imho, they are now growth stocks. Yet their respective valuations (share price) haven't yet completely caught up. They are where the likes of Garmin and AMD used to be before, but unlike Garmin and AMD now, the P/S & P/E ratios of Sony, Turtle Beach and Nautilus are still on the low to very low side compared to same-segment competitors.",Audacimmus,2,/r/stocks/comments/lkgs4l/growth_stocks/gnkn8p6/,0.038,0.734,0.228,0.9989

453,UK," I’d have thought external factors are equally important to consider. 
If you invest in, say, mondelez (owner of Cadbury’s chocolate): knowing that there has been a massive drop in cocoa production will really impact your decision to invest. Do you invest more because the price of a chocolate bar will go up, or do you cut your investment because the costs of making a bar that has less chocolate in it might put customers off buying.

Another example is Cineworld. All cinemas in the UK have been closed. The price has fallen dramatically, purely Covid related, people suggested the company had problems before Covid, and yet, they’ve not gone bankrupt yet, so does that mean now is the time to get a good deal on Cineworld?

My opinion on the stocks would be that although FB is the cheapest they have constant criticism about how they use data which can be cause for concern since people are worrying about how company’s use their data more and more. 
Although McD’s has been a solid company since the beginning of time as people become more health conscious will this effect the stock in the future (10+ years, I don’t think they’re going anywhere soon tho) however if need be I’m sure mcD’s can replace their menu with healthier options in the space of weeks so I wouldn’t worry too much - but something to consider",Aquapac,5,/r/stocks/comments/lkevmz/mcdonalds_apple_microsoft_fb/gnjkie9/,0.083,0.881,0.036,-0.8109

They can diverisfy and conquer so many areas in the tech world and even outside the tech world, like with Apple and EVs. Microsoft is also really great and their full drive in the cloud space is really impressive. Both of their financials are really solid and their revenue growth is astonishing. 

Now Facebook. They have a good business, but the market is, and will keep undervaluating the company because of its constant lawsuits and all the data tracking stuff. Even Apple is restricting their data tracking which is a big negative for FB. They have their VR stuff going on which has a lot of room to grow.

499,PT," People are sleeping on the energy sector (oil).

Currently, oil stocks have been top performers in 2021 and Wall St has a 400% larger short on the sector versus the rest of the SP500. 

Oil is higher than where it was pre-pandemic. All commodities are rising quickly and we haven't even begun to re-open yet. 

The oil majors are anywhere from 20-50% undervalued based on historical correlations with oil prices.

EVs and renewable energy may be a hot topic for retail investors, but that's not going to be useful at all in the short term. 

Oil demand was 97 mil barrels\day (bpd) pre pandemic. Currently sits at about 92 m bpd during the lockdowns everywhere. Projected to be 105m bpd by 2025. 

Oil stocks here are a no-brainer. They're incredibly undervalued cyclicals that don't get even the slightest consideration by retail investors and large parts of Wall Street because of politics. 

ExxonMobil ($XOM) is the most sensitive and levered way to play oil prices rising. Oh and you get a 7% quarterly dividend to wait. If you want diversification in the sector, pick out $XLE ETF. 

As positive momentum starts to build on these stocks (it already has to a large extent), the hedge funds will have to undo short positions.

Maybe my next piece of thinking is if not Cement in Africa then what? And if the answer is just to invest in an African based ETF why are the returns on those ETF's have been so poor the last 5 years...

530,AAPL," It's a tricky situation because of after market/pre-market pricing.  For example, lets use AAPL which is currently trading at around $135.

You bought in at $120 and want to set a stop limit at $125 so you get a little profit if it drops.  Sounds good, right?

Well, if the stop drops to $128 during market hours and then drops to $122 after hours, when the market opens, the stock price will be below your limit which triggers a sell. You've now sold at $122, which is $3 below your stop price

Just because you have a limit set, it isn't going to automatically sell for that.  It'll sell for that price or lower.

edit:  the same could happen for a crash during regular market hours.

542,EV," First, we aren’t talking hypotheticals here. Whether we should or shouldn’t is completely irrelevant. This isn’t a corner of Reddit where the hive mind is pushing agenda. This is about making money and securing financial futures for ourselves. 

With renewables, it isn’t fair to compare to another country. Geographic and weather conditions are absolutely everything and Germany is a small footprint compared to the US. The US spans multiple climate zones. This is significant. One could incorrectly compare US to Norway as a proof of concept. Except the US does not have the hydro power capabilities Norway does. 

Now, Germany is actually important in this discussion. Because while you, and many others, are praising their efforts, they are sitting on an extremely fragile power grid that is actually posing as a word of warning to other countries venturing down the same path. Most of Germany’s wind production is in the north. And since you can’t transport that production easily, Southern Germany is struggling to meet power needs. Because wind is a primary source, Germany cannot simply shut down turbines like the US can to save money and drive costs down. So they have been paying neighboring countries not to import energy so they can send their excess wind power out. Like I said, this is a risk US Oil and Gas faces as well as fossil fuels are the primary source of energy; produce even when it is not economical. Because of these shortfalls, Germany is projected to be a net *importer* of energy in 2 years. In terms of emissions goals, it is projected that for all this effort, Germany has only shaved 8 years off. 

Germany also had a much different starting point than the US. Natural Gas prices are $3 in the US. They are almost $5 in Germany. That price difference makes renewables more economical from an opportunity cost standpoint.

Another hit to renewables in the US is poor politicians on both sides. No one has outlined a solution to any of these problems. I’ve read all public documents on Biden’s deal. It has absolutely nothing of substance. It is quite literally just throwing money at a problem and hoping for the best. Go down to the homeless shelter and start passing out $100 bills and tell me how many of them actually turn their lives around. This is Biden’s plan. And when nothing meaningful materializes from this lack of direction, Republicans just use this as ammunition to get elected and reverse everything sending these companies spiraling. 

It’s evident that all of this is politics influenced and not an effort for the betterment of the Earth. Just look at how the narrative has attacked the oil and gas companies. Pinned them as evil and has become a political chess piece in destroying the industry. Why? The science and technology involved in drilling a hole a mile underground and squeezing chemicals from rock is incredible. Why not partner with the industry and utilize their innovation to help reach an agreeable solution? Transform the industry into a clean industry. Not cancel an industry and throw money at a poorly developed baby industry. As a comparison, this exact thing is happening with the auto industry. All manufacturers will eventually have robust EV lines. We didn’t tell Ford and GM to stop and find ways to prevent them from producing while pumping money at Tesla. No, Tesla showed them there was a market and a need and a value, they all jumped on board.

My guess is, the money shift to clean energy stocks knows all of this. They are riding the wave. When will they jump to the next fad? Who knows.

564,PLTR," An IPO ( Initial Public Offering ), is when a private company goes public and offers for the first time, shares of their company to the public.  This is usually done to raise $ for corporate purposes, not typically to allow early investors a chance to sell.  Most IPO's restrict early investors from selling for a period of a few months to a few years.

A direct listing ( PLTR for example ) is when a company goes public, but is not trying to raise capital.  Therefore, they do not need to hire an investment bank.  A company chooses this route because they are likely paying employees stock, and need a way to sell shares in an efficient manner.  A lot of tech companies offer shares to employees as a bonus, or as a part of their overall compensation.  Aa a private company, this creates liquidity constraints for their employees.  Another benefit of a direct listing is reduced dilution to existing shareholders.  An investment bank can take up to 7% cash plus 7% in broker warrants to sell a capital raise.  The bankers make a lot of money and are not restricted in when they can sell their warrants.  That is a significant dilutive issue to some corporations.",yukonwilder14,3,/r/stocks/comments/lkeaeu/ipo_vs_direct_listing/gnjdrlx/,0.016,0.844,0.141,0.9774

614,PFE," PFE was higher in mid-2016 than it is right now. It was flat in 2020. It’s down since mid 2018.

It was the first company to come out with its “final” vaccine news in early November, and it held its gains from that news for all of a few days.

It popped again in December (but still not to its ATH) and completely retraced that gain in 2 weeks, and has been slowly falling ever since.

615,OI," Pfizer isn’t going up anytime soon to a price worth playing. Their next earnings should show substantial growth and their forward P/E puts them at a lower ratio than any other big pharma company. But still I see that maybe putting them back around $38. It’s a slow boat. Too many retailers have been burned trying to play options, but the float is so large on this that that institutions just crush any large OI.

Though I'm not sure JnJ is a great comparison either since they make so many things besides pharmaceuticals. Also, I'd argue that while 42% eps growth is great it is likely somewhat temporary (or at least the amount of it that comes from vaccine profits). The vaccine will only get more competition as time goes on and it remains to be seen how much recurring revenue there will be once most of the people who want it have gotten it.",SteamedHamSalad,1,/r/stocks/comments/lkgf6k/catalyst_for_pfizer/gnkk00k/,0.038,0.836,0.126,0.8732
