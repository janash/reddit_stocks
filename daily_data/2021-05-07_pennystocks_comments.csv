18,DD," Just going to chime in here. First thank you for the DD. I found it very peculiar that it was getting's om movement and their website/crypto page is lack for a better term not company worthy. Something my 7th grade self would've slapped together.

Ive dabbled with crypto and am currently mining (not a huge operation but its fairly sizeable). So in short, the crypto was what appealed to me. I bought 2200 shares for like 50 bucks or so price was a .029. But their crypto idea if true is actually a really great idea. No one says that you cannot tie crypto to actual real world assets. Crypto is mined via algos is so that the confirmations of transactions are confirmed in the blockchain. Each transactions ties to another in a series of blocks, that are hardcoded to each other (this is the unhackable and cant fuck with it or edit part). Miners mine, so that they may confirm all transactions on said block chain and thus are rewarded, each coin has their own block chain but these days it looks like a small percentage is on the BTC blockchain protocol, and the rest are on erc20 (ethereum blockchain). Meaning that they share the same structure but are in fact separate.  Some are on Binance chain etc. 

Everything about this company screams PUMP AND DUMP though, their lack luster website. No details or data on anything.  Just some reddit articles. A fairly active twitter. And their crypto page offering no details but would gladly grab your information etc.   


With that being said I really did want to like this company. One: owning part of a mine is just some cool shit. 2nd their crypto offering, if a company were to raise money how would they do it? By creating shares, or selling their private shares on the open market.  the small part about their coin I did read up on, is backed by 2100 in BTC, 2100 in ETH, 2100 in gold (troy oz)  and 2100 in silver (troy oz) @ 2 usd per coin with a current cap of 250MILL usd. Now we wont know this for sure until an actual address is re leased. Which i am appalled as I couldn't find that. Alt5 looks like a legit company. actual website and data on what is they do. I created an account and browsed their exchange. However their app is broken.

Now, using these backed crypto coins (250 million worth), they now have the capital to start mining or do whatever it is they needed to do; buy equipment or exploration or whatever. This is just one shining example, crypto (blockchains) can/will start taking things over in the near future. Can you imagine a blockchain based stock market? where 1 share = 1 coin etc. This will allow companies to keep track of their shares, as well as not allowing fuckery from happening such as naked short selling etc. Blockchains are intended to be decentralized so this will mean anyone can see where each stock/coin is and who owns it. Imagine a company before going public mints and sale coins instead of shares. Comp growth and profits = value of coin if it goes up or down same as a stock. 

So yes fuck yes, i wanted this company to be legit. but i feel you are right, your gut is right lol. Because the lack of data, the recent dump in price etc. The xxx million in shares created and diluted over and over again. I put in money i can live without so ill bag hodl for shit and gigs. But i didn't buy their coin.

One thing that struck out to me is, we are all fairly competent apes here. Their coin is an erc20 coin (Ethereum based), so if anyone bought their coin, and don't mind sharing the contract address we can simply take a look into their coin a bit more. I am actually surprised that no one did that yet. As all things blockchain is on the public net lmao so it wouldn't be hard to find some real concrete data and if it actually exists. 

 In a small sense of things, these guys are trying to raise 250million USD via crypto coin tied to a real world asset vs the fuck ton of rug pulls and SAFEMOON coin that has 7B market cap at the current moment lol.

While TRCH won‚Äôt just let it go for free, their cards are on the table so they probably will be selling it at a discounted price.

I am mentally trying to expect $1-2 range just to not get my hopes up but do think $5/share is very possible. Anywhere in the $10-25 range would be a dream come true, but I am long on Meta so I like the deal regardless because we get Meta shares + dividend",OutrageousAnimals,9,/r/pennystocks/comments/n72hj1/trch_train_ddinformation/gxajvmj/,0.014,0.808,0.178,0.9459
32,TRCH," Even if you got $2 a share for the dividend, MMATF is worth 3.706 x TRCH value at merger. If TRCH merges at $2, MMATF is worth almost $8. I paid $2 for MMATF shares. That's a 4 bagger.

Or 3 of TRCH for 1 of new and 1 of meta to 1 of new?   


Is it not working like one of those breakdowns?",SpeculativeFantasm,7,/r/pennystocks/comments/n72hj1/trch_train_ddinformation/gxaqmb3/,0.054,0.792,0.154,0.5987
35,TRCH," I think you are missing something here - I'm not sure where you're confusing things though.

After the merger, for every share of TRCH you own, you will have 1 share of the new ticker MMAT. Whatever you own in TRCH becomes the equivalent in MMAT (new ticker on NASDAQ) - plus the extra dividend whatever that will be.

&#x200B;

MMATF (Canadian OTC) is going to ultimately control \~75% of the company after the merger. For every 1 share of MMATF you own, you'll receive somewhere around 3.5 shares of MMAT (new ticker on NASDAQ). That number is fluid/not set in stone however due to the differences in number of Outstanding Shares between MMATF and TRCH. However the end result is the same - MMATF shareholders will own \~75% of the company post-merger.

[April 21 - PRER14A Filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001431959/000119312521124753/d117540dprer14a.htm)

Page 33 -   *What percentage of the Combined Company will the stockholders of Torchlight and shareholders of Meta own?*   and  *What is the Exchange Ratio under the Arrangement?*  


I believe you are misunderstanding something how how the total shares and such will work. As a TRCH holder you will not LOSE any shares. Your shares will transfer 1:1. However, they are making room for the 75% ownership of MMATF by increasing the outstanding shares which is voting item "" (1) to approve the issuance of up to approximately 455,000,000 shares of Torchlight common stock""

Once the special meeting is declared, this will be voting Item #1 to be determined. And ultimately will be a determination of if the merger is approved.

So yes. TRCH will control roughly 25% of the new company. But TRCH will also retain control of all of their current shares and transfer over as a 1:1 ratio.",xhavez,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/n72hj1/trch_train_ddinformation/gxb5i4e/,0.022,0.851,0.128,0.9649

85,DD," Tells me that if those warrants are exercised the price will be well above 0.12 which as a shareholder who is probably in at .05 should be a decent vote of confidence. The warrants will add to the total float if they do get exercised and with a three year window they probably will but again if the price is around 17 cents at the time it won't have much of an impact on the total stock value. If your DD see catalysts that will get the company over 10 cents and beyond then I wouldn't let this concern you. Added benefit of the redemption of the warrants is that they are redeemed directly to the company at the 12 cent price point. This often means the company can finance their operations for a while on the warrant redemption rather than doing another financing. With the redemption so far out of the money currently it looks like you would have a lot more upside than not. ( Unless of course they never get over 12 cents. Then they will expire unredeemed.)

Warrants have to priced above the placement price although it is usually a lot closer in the money like 7 or 8 cents on a 5 cent placement. Feels like the 12 cent was to partially incentivise the placement and to not undervalue the future stock price. Financings are generally priced under market so the warrants can balance it out.
