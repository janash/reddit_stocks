Apparently Melvin Capital got a $2.6 billion bailout. What are they likely to do with that? Would they actually be crazy enough to keep shorting (would there be any advantage), or are they just probably going to try to break even?

13,SHO,"Kind of off topic, but   

Short interest can exceed float because the same share can be shorted multiple times. Bob buys stock A. He lends it to Alice who sells it short to Lisa. She lends it to Bruce who sells it short to Jim. And so on...  
With that said, naked shorting (shorting without first locating and borrowing shares) is legal for options market makers under Regulation SHO, but illegal for others. https://nope-its-lily.medium.com/gamestop-power-to-the-market-players-part-1-d8863f2f8604  

A short squeeze is when rising prices create pressure for short sellers to cover their shorts by buying back the shares, which causes the price to rise which causes more covering and so on. It can happen due to one or more of: margin calls/constraints, borrow interest, lack of borrowable shares.  

Gamma trap is when people buy calls and options market makers sell them and hedge their own exposure by buying shares. Initially they buy some number of shares, less than 100, equal to the option's delta. As the stock price rises, the delta also rises until it gets fairly in the money and plateaus at 100% (the rate of change in delta wrt stock price is called gamma). So they hedge their options by buying more shares, which again can lead to a feedback loop, at least until most of the options they've written are in the money and gamma becomes low.",0.064,0.817,0.12,0.9081

- The Microsoft deal. GME is getting a cut of pretty much everything on XBOX (games, skins, lootboxes, you name it) in return for being Microsoft's physical storefront. Disc sales are still a significant proportion of console sales (40%+), there's a reason disc consoles are outselling the digital consoles.

I've currently been holding WIZ, which is another AI ETF and it's also outperformed the S&P 500.

One of the things that I think it will struggle with is looking at qualitative information - which is often why I believe these AI based ETFs attempt to quantify sentiment as a metric.

260,API,"I would agree with you fundamentally however from my experience in the business world fundamentals often don’t align with what’s best for the balance sheet. On the surface it certainly seems like cutting out the middle man is a way to ensure maximum profit, however GameStop wouldn’t be a “middle man”, they would be a partner. There are many benefits to companies partnering, the first and largest would be a shared customer base. Clients are the only important commodity. There are many other benefits from marketing to technology sharing and if you purely want to think financially, there are even tax benefits for partnering. 

Currently Microsoft has software engineers that are tasked with running the store, let’s assume there are 12 of them each making $100,000 per year. Microsoft could reassign those individuals to a new task to bolster their business if they partner with GameStop. If they choose to go it alone, they will need to keep those 12 individuals doing their job ($1.2m/yr) and they will need to have other engineers working on their other projects. Not to mention no software engineer wants to work at Microsoft so they can manage an online store. So they would be saving on turnover/churn rates. These are some of the reasons why Microsoft has already signed a revenue sharing agreement. It saves everyone money, brings new clients, allows room to work on new technologies since your staff isn’t  spread thin, marketing, tax benefits, etc. The list goes on and on but partnering with a company is almost always more profitable than doing it organically no matter how large or small your business is. 

To drive the point home, an example of a middle man would be something like Stripe. A payment API to handle all your payments for your app. When you are a younger company it certainly makes sense to use this API instead of trying to build it organically, but as you scale it might make sense to develop your own payment structure. Even this is a stretch though, because it truthfully might benefit your company to continue paying stripe so you don’t have to worry about Cybersecurity, staff, patching, regulations, etc. This is the closest thing I can think of to provide an example but my opinion is in modern business, middle man is a dated concept.

296,OVID,"So, I don't think I can call myself an expert, but I can offer you my perspective on what is going on.

Broadly speaking, I feel that there are 2 different perspectives on looking at stocks.  These complement each other most of the time, but they don't necessarily always agree.  (Even calling them different perspectives is perhaps wrong, as their interplay is fundamental to the market.)

First viewpoint is that stocks are a tiny piece of a company.  As such, they are worth their proportion of all future profit of that company.  There are a couple of important details to note here.  To start with, money has time value.  Money today is worth more than the same amount next week.  This means that far future earnings are worth less then immediate earnings.  (My argument will hinge on exactly how much less.) Next, investors don't have perfect crystal balls to predict the future with.  This means that people or organizations need to make educated guesses as to how a company will grow and what its future profits will look like.  While you can look through earnings reports, cash flows, and balance sheets, but in the end there is a good degree of uncertainty to the prediction.  Furthermore, if a company is poorly managed, it might squander that money, failing to return it to investors or providing futher growth to the company.

Second viewpoint is that stocks are worth what people are willing to pay for them.  People or organizations are willing to buy or sell pieces of companies at particular valuations.  Stocks don't truly have inherent value; rather, the price that they trade at defines what they are worth.  Put another way, because you don't know the future of the company, the free market's pricing is the best way to set it's value. 

Now, in theory, these viewpoints work together.  The market's pricing of the stock is the communal best guess as to the company's future earnings.  But here's where investor psychology takes over-people react in certain ways to gaining or losing money.  People can overreact to bad news, underestimate risk, fail to see future growth opportunities, etc.  

To back this up a bit, we should again touch upon the idea of the time value of money.  We should look at what happens when the federal interest rate drops.  When interest rates drop, the percentage yield on US government bonds tends to drop with it.  Generally, this means that putting $100 away for a year in the safest place possible, (US Gov bonds...they're not perfectly safe, but if they aren't worth anything, stocks won't be either; you'll be measuring wealth in canned foods and bullets.) you gain less money than you would have previously.  In short, dropping the interest rate reduces the time value of money.  In turn, this means that future earnings of a company are worth proportionally more.  

Put it this way: would you rather put $100 in a government bond earning 5% for a year, or would you rather take some risk in the stock market that earns an average of 7% in a year?  Now, if government bonds earned 2% in a year while the stock market earns an average of 7% per year, would this potentially change your answer?  And what do you think the overall market would do?

In short, lowering interest rates lowered the time value of money, meaning that future earnings were discounted less.  In turn, this drives the theoretical value of stocks upward.  The market, made up of people and organizations, reacts by driving prices up.  This is because the market realizes that COVID earnings may be trash, but future earnings will probably recover at some point.  The FED raising interest rates is expected at some point, but not in the immediate future.  And to top it all off, with all these changes, some investors seem to have made some interesting assumptions as to the future of certain companies, leading to large swings in valuations for some stocks.  This is why stocks are up in spite of current economic turmoil.  

That's my 2 cents as to why we're here.  Just don't ask me where the stock market will go next.  Those crystal balls are apparently on backorder; I'm still waiting for mine to get here.",0.089,0.755,0.156,0.9952

But once edge computing really gets rolling, companies (especially hyperscalers), might need mini-Data Center rapidly deployed. My money is on DLR. But it's still really early.

Right now I am in NET, LLNW, and CCI for edge computing plays. 

I also think Amazon, Microsoft, and Google will benefit from edge computing as well. And I don't know why they will need to rely on a Data Center REIT to rapidly deploy a mini-data center. The big hyperscalers can probably do this themselves. If not, they will need to work with some of the Data center REITs. I own Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, but not for the edge computing potential. Though, that is a nice benefit.

EDIT: Almost forgot this one but LUMN which used to be known as Century Link.

With 5G and Edge Computing, there will be a fiber demand. And LUMN is dirt cheap atm with an awesome yield. I've been adding to this.

Good luck! And great job thinking about the edge! It's being overlooked imo. 5G, IoT, autonomous driving, smart cars will all require the Edge.",0.027,0.759,0.215,0.9974

400,IFF,"This is complicated stuff but in essence DuPont is divesting its N&B business and merging it with IFF. 

It is tax advantageous for companies to divest business lines like this by doing a spin-off/split-off (also know as a stock dividend to shareholders) rather than selling the business for cash (in which case they would be subject to a large tax bill if sold for a gain). 

In a typical ""spin-off"", each DuPont shareholder would get pro rata ownership in the N&B business that is being spun off and merging with IFF. This transaction is a bit different as it is a ""split off"" rather than a ""spin off"" - in essence, each DuPont shareholder will get the option as to whether they want to tender into the split (have their investment go with the N&B division which is merging with IFF) or decline the tender (and keep their investment in DuPont parent). They offer a premium for shareholders to tender into the split-off (the $107 vs. $100 delta) in order to incentivize shareholders to opt into the new deal and allow them to complete the transaction.

The key decision point for you should be - would you prefer to have $100 invested in DuPont parent or $107 invested into the new N&B/IFF merged company? Which do you think has more growth potential? Will there be synergies from the merger? Which will have the better mgmt team?",0.0,0.92,0.08,0.9581

When I short a stock, someone is ""loaning"" me a stock. I sell it now. Now I wait. 

If the stock goes down, I buy it back at a lower price and give it back. I've made a profit. If the stock goes up, I buy it back at a higher price and give it back. I've made a loss.

However, from the lender's side, why would I let you borrow my stock to short for free? I wouldn't. I would charge you interest. So the longer you hold the stock, the more you owe me in interest. This is why short positions are short in time.

So if the price of a stock is going up, and won't stop going up, you'll lose twice. You'll lose on interest AND on the extra you'd have to pay to get it back. This means you'll probably buy back early to cut your losses, unless your pockets are REALLY deep.

The price of the stock is usually independent of my short action. Especially if the volume of shorting is small compared to shares being traded.

However, it's public information how many shares are being shorted. The % of shares being shorted to total shares outstanding is the ""short interest"".

If this short interest is high, a third party might see a lot of people believe the stock will go down, and either try to exit and sell, or avoid buying, lowering the price. This is supply and demand in conjunction with human psychology.

On the flip side... GME today.

The short interest was over 100%. That means there were more shares shorted than shares available. This should remind you of debt crises, because that's what this is.

This occurs when someone shorts a share, someone buys the shorted stock, and lends it out again. The same share is being loaned out twice, and the second lender isn't paying attention. 

If this repeats a lot, short interest exceeds 100%. 

Now, if a bunch of retail investors... say on WSB's, collectively decide they like a company, they can start pushing the price up as they all buy. 

The people shorting the stock suddenly need to to also buy back the shares to cut losses.
