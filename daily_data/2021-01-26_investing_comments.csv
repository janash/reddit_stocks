1,GME,"I think you might be overlooking hedge funds looking at the business fundamentals. GameStop as a company is losing money (negative net income) while losing revenue on a year-to-year basis. Their current business model is basically not competitive the way that console and PC gaming is going and they should be on their way to insolvency. All that being said, if someone (or in this case a LOT of someone) sees a strong short market on a particular stock, any number of shares trading to the upside causes the short holder to do one of two things: eat it or buy shares. If the shares aren’t there, they have to bid higher. This happens until the bets are covered. Then price discovery is supposed to take over. $GME share price has nothing to do with the current business and everything to do with order flow and being on the wrong side of volume and interest.",0.06,0.84,0.1,0.679
2,ABC,"First a ""pump and dump"" - this is a **con** in which someone (or some group) enters a position on stock ABC and then goes around hyping it up, lying about key points, and intentionally manipulating the price action by buying/selling their large block of shares. This first part is the ""pump"".

Then they, again as an organized group entity acting in unison, unload their whole position. They're selling off their shares at a higher price to the exact people they were convincing to buy in. Ideally they close their whole position just as the buying momentum tops out. This is the dump.


They group never cared about owning ABC stock - they just used it as the tool to con others.

Massive shorting, while predatory and in extreme cases potentially market manipulation, is usually not a coordinated attack by groups of people intentionally working together.

GME for example is a company that has sat around doing nothing to stave off their inevitable demise for literally 5+ years, so lots and lots of short sellers saw the same opportunity to short the stock and cover at 0 when it went bankrupt. They weren't all working together or intentionally suppressing the price (probably not anyway).

Not gonna comment on who made the hype, that's complex and speculative, but: GME stocks aren't worth anything close to what they're going for; nobody thinks it's a long-term buy and hold, and it'll eventually come back down because it's propped up by temporary contractual demand and speculation, not underlying value. TL,DR: ""buy the dip"" will work as long as it's not the last dip. Buy that dip, and by the time you want out, it'll be at an absolutely massive loss.

Why: The shorters are obligated to buy stock they shorted in order to fulfill their contract (return the borrowed stock). The entity the shorters had/have a contract with that get the stock back, and won't be looking to keep it at inflated values. They'll sell it to another shorter, who fulfills their contract, decreasing demand. One stock can be resold infinitely, so it doesn't matter if most people are holding. Shorters are delaying buying in hopes it drops before their contract is up, and  people are holding the stock in hopes it keeps going. Once demand drops enough (enough shorters have bought and closed their contract, and some speculators sell to take their profits) it'll dip. Some people will buy the dip, but eventually it'll plummet. Whoever owns GME when it plummets will have their $150? stock turn into a $10? stock, and they're who u/caedin8 is talking about ""holding the bag.""

You're assuming the gaming market is video games only.  There's tons of money to be made in physical merch.  Apparel, collectibles, officially licensed anything is lucrative.  Imagine an Amazon marketplace dedicated to gaming products.  Imagine ordering your digital download from GameStop, and the GameStop exclusive code includes <EXCLUSIVE IN GAME CONTENT>.

And maybe their deal with Microsoft could make this possible, but it’d have to basically be an Xbox/MSFT store exclusive you can only get at GME, so that would seem weird to me and it’s not clear that MSFT would benefit at all from this. 

I’d be interested to see how large of a market gaming merch is, but I doubt it’s enough to sustain retail stores all across the country.

One thing I think could potentially work for them is custom-built PCs. I know a few friends who want to move to PC for gaming as I did a few years ago, but the idea of building one is too daunting for them and the price of pre-builts online is kind of ridiculous.

People who don't have many spare dollars need to have a retirement nest egg too (and god knows if social security will exist in 40 years), and sometimes these risky plays are the only way to do it. Not YOLO on GME-squeeze level risky plays, but stuff like ARKK funds, swing trading CRSR, etc. If it fails and they lose 20%, they'd only really be down a few hundred bucks.

Remember that the median income (avg distorted by outliers) in America is below 16 an hour. That's assuming full time by the way, tons of people are forced to work part time and need multiple jobs to get by, so the hourly rate could be less. Majority of Americans also don't have 1k saved for an emergency, especially right now. Those part timers also don't get health insurance from their employer.

If you have a hundred bucks a month invested for 40 years at 7%, you'll only get to 250k. Sounds like a lot but it'll probably be only worth 100k or less of today's dollars due to inflation. i.e, not really enough to retire on. Formula gets more complicated since typically wages go up to keep pace with inflation, but the minimum wage certainly hasn't.

People were expecting a market crash post march lows because everyone was concerned over the disconnect between the stock market and the underlying performance of the economy. My take is that while these might be symptoms, what really causes a crash is the overcrowding in the market and the total disregard for “how much” and “why”. The market is slowly turning into an unintentional ponzi scheme, where new investors are joining the market, to replicate the financial success of their peers. They don’t have much knowledge of the stock market or even any financial knowledge, but they do know one thing - buy stock ABC in industry DEF and you will double your money. As time progresses, the bubble becomes more and more fragile, and all it takes is a slight catalyst and the selling will gain momentum like a landslide. Because at the end of the day, if there wasn’t any thought put into buying the stock, there wouldn’t be any thought keeping the stock. They would sell as quickly as the market tells them too.

101,MSFT,"The other side of the argument is that you can absolutely identify the stocks that have better characteristics and can purchase them. Since you cited the academic research of the EMH, I will assume that you're aware of the momentum factor which is the greatest challenger to the idea of the EMH. Stocks that win can continue to win for extended periods of time (in many cases this ""extend period"" can be over a person's lifetime). Outperformance combined with time is what makes them perform so well overall.

Look at companies like UnitedHealth. It's generally returned 20% per year since inception (CAGR weighted over a multi-decade period). Generally, purchasing UNH shares means that you should expect to receive 20% in a year (expectation does not mean guarantee). There are plenty of other examples of this that can be identified. Home Depot, Costco, Ball Corporation, Old Dominion, Intuit, etc. I've identified plenty of companies which fall into this category.

Building a portfolio of these companies that generally outperform has led to outperformance over time. While you can argue that you cannot eat off of the past (I agree), I wouldn't bet on these companies that have survived various regulatory (policy) challenges, leadership changes, and various interest rates to suddenly start underperforming when looked at on a multi-year basis.

Additionally, what I've found in my own investing is that when these companies underperform relative to the SPY (beta of 1.0), the index also ends up underperforming over that period. The argument that these companies ""cannot perform this well"" into the future is an invalid one, as it's just as speculative vs saying the index will continue to perform at n-rate. Neither of us can predict the future and any kind of analysis relies heavily on past data (again, both policy and regulatory data).

Outperformance combined with time is what makes them perform so well overall.

Look at companies like UnitedHealth. It's generally returned 20% per year since inception (CAGR weighted over a multi-decade period). Generally, purchasing UNH shares means that you should expect to receive 20% in a year (expectation does not mean guarantee). There are plenty of other examples of this that can be identified. Home Depot, Costco, Ball Corporation, Old Dominion, Intuit, etc. I've identified plenty of companies which fall into this category.

Building a portfolio of these companies that generally outperform has led to outperformance over time. While you can argue that you cannot eat off of the past (I agree), I wouldn't bet on these companies that have survived various regulatory (policy) challenges, leadership changes, and various interest rates to suddenly start underperforming when looked at on a multi-year basis.

Additionally, what I've found in my own investing is that when these companies underperform relative to the SPY (beta of 1.0), the index also ends up underperforming over that period. The argument that these companies ""cannot perform this well"" into the future is an invalid one, as it's just as speculative vs saying the index will continue to perform at n-rate.

148,AI,"Microsoft cut a revenue sharing deal with GameStop. What you’re missing is it’s profitable to do both. Microsoft can have their store on Xbox AND utilize GameStop’s 50 mil customer base. Furthermore a mistake that is too often made is the assumption that online store cost less money. They aren’t powered by AI they are powered by highly skilled programmers and have a lot of regulations built in. 

The only difference between online stores and brick and mortar is the cost of having the physical location plus employees vs the cost of maintaining servers and paying programmers. Truthfully it would be great for all of these companies if GameStop can provide a unified one stop shop so they can focus on hardware/game dev instead.

Another note is digital games is a fraction of GameStops plan moving forward with Cohen and friends joining the board. The locations that are still profitable will remain open, but not just as a game store instead as a place for esports, desktop building kiosks, etc. 

The other significantly large plan they have already in motion is to conduct all levels of e-commerce. As silly as it sounds that means yes, competing with Amazon. Someone has to.

149,GME,"Microsoft cut a revenue sharing deal with GameStop. What you’re missing is it’s profitable to do both. Microsoft can have their store on Xbox AND utilize GameStop’s 50 mil customer base. Furthermore a mistake that is too often made is the assumption that online store cost less money. They aren’t powered by AI they are powered by highly skilled programmers and have a lot of regulations built in. 

The only difference between online stores and brick and mortar is the cost of having the physical location plus employees vs the cost of maintaining servers and paying programmers. Truthfully it would be great for all of these companies if GameStop can provide a unified one stop shop so they can focus on hardware/game dev instead.

Another note is digital games is a fraction of GameStops plan moving forward with Cohen and friends joining the board. The locations that are still profitable will remain open, but not just as a game store instead as a place for esports, desktop building kiosks, etc. 

The other significantly large plan they have already in motion is to conduct all levels of e-commerce. As silly as it sounds that means yes, competing with Amazon. Someone has to.

On the surface it certainly seems like cutting out the middle man is a way to ensure maximum profit, however GameStop wouldn’t be a “middle man”, they would be a partner. There are many benefits to companies partnering, the first and largest would be a shared customer base. Clients are the only important commodity. There are many other benefits from marketing to technology sharing and if you purely want to think financially, there are even tax benefits for partnering. 

Currently Microsoft has software engineers that are tasked with running the store, let’s assume there are 12 of them each making $100,000 per year. Microsoft could reassign those individuals to a new task to bolster their business if they partner with GameStop. If they choose to go it alone, they will need to keep those 12 individuals doing their job ($1.2m/yr) and they will need to have other engineers working on their other projects. Not to mention no software engineer wants to work at Microsoft so they can manage an online store. So they would be saving on turnover/churn rates. These are some of the reasons why Microsoft has already signed a revenue sharing agreement. It saves everyone money, brings new clients, allows room to work on new technologies since your staff isn’t  spread thin, marketing, tax benefits, etc. The list goes on and on but partnering with a company is almost always more profitable than doing it organically no matter how large or small your business is. 

To drive the point home, an example of a middle man would be something like Stripe. A payment API to handle all your payments for your app. When you are a younger company it certainly makes sense to use this API instead of trying to build it organically, but as you scale it might make sense to develop your own payment structure. Even this is a stretch though, because it truthfully might benefit your company to continue paying stripe so you don’t have to worry about Cybersecurity, staff, patching, regulations, etc. This is the closest thing I can think of to provide an example but my opinion is in modern business, middle man is a dated concept.

This is not a ""price correction"".  It's creating a price *distortion*.  In the long run, prices revert to a level based on how much money they can return to investors (discounted cash flow, etc) vs how much return investors demand in exchange for the risk.  When people pour money in the price goes up, the risk increases, and the return decreases.  If prices were too low before then this could indeed be a correction.

Here's the bear case. AMD is eating Intel's lunch. Their stock price will reflect this. And they likely won't have a serious response to this until 2023 based on their most recent earnings call.

I like IVR, too, because I like the management of the company and I've been in since April.  However, don't count on them rebounding to their pre-crash price ""just cuz"".  They liquidated something like 80% of their assets to cover margin calls.  They own 80% less and that intrinsically affects the valuation of the company and the shares.

A lot of people were playing REITs like the rest of the stock market while not understanding underlying valuations in this sector.",0.0,0.809,0.191,0.9393

Thank you in advance for reading the all of the details to the best of your ability before making a conclusion. 


-I’m in my early 30s living in the US. Single, living with family for the last 4 yrs to build up savings. No children & no plan to have children. No plan to ever have a big wedding (both are just not part of my value systems)

-I’m currently between jobs, collecting unemployment and some small income. For most of my 20s I was broke AF but between 29 and Covid times I had finally done really well as I was able to do some modeling. I don’t see myself going back full time to that because it was not healthy and since I have some savings and some small income, I’m attempting to take my time finding a better career fit for myself. I am open to the idea of going back to school (this is an important detail since that is an expense I would need to consider). I do have a basic bachelors degree and fallback plan to at least make a basic living if I can’t find my dream job. I’m keeping my living expenses very low currently.

- Since having made some real income I was able to pay off my student loan debt (I’m debt free). Build up an emergency savings of about $8,300 that is in what was a HY online savings account (lol to HY). Invested the max contribution to my ROTH IRA for the last few years so now that’s sitting at about $18k. I also invested in Vanguard index funds at the advice of a friend a couple years ago because I wanted some investments outside of my ROTH and that’s sitting at about $7k (I told myself I’d let this sit for at least 5 yrs). Additionally I have about $19k doing nothing (sitting in an investment account but not invested) and $6k in my checking account.

- I’m not totally ignorant to investing but I also find it very stressful and confusing. My father was a financial advisor for a while and has done well for himself. He mostly helps me manage everything and that’s how I know most of what I know. He’s bought me many books and what not over the years but try as I might I find the nuances overwhelming to understand but I do feel I understand the basics or at least the basics that my father values. He is very old school and does not believe in short term/riskier investing and from what I understand, I agree with him. It intrigues me but based on my feelings on investing I think safe, long term is best for me but I see many people getting involved with Robinhood and riskier type investing so I’m always wondering if I should be doing more. If it were up to my father (which obviously it’s not) the bulk of my savings would be entirely in very long very long term investments. 

- So here’s the question....I really don’t know what do with my $18k. I know it’s very bad it’s been sitting and not working for me but there was a time I thought I might try and buy a home so I was nervous to invest it. I am still open to buying a home if there was a good opportunity but I’m very picky and considering I don’t have the regular life plan of the average person (get married, have kids, die in the burbs) I don’t feel pressured to buy a home that doesn’t suit my own life style. I also want to be open to the idea of going back to school. So there is some possibility I would need those funds quickly in either direction. It feels like there isn’t really a good solution to this other than putting that also in another savings account or even CD just to have SOME return but interest levels are so low it kinda feels like there isn’t a point. I sort of feel like the only one in this position because everyone I know has a specific long term goal (for example dead-set on buying a house, or starting a family). It occurred to me recently that there must be other out there with the same feelings? 

- Since I’m so particular about buying a home (and currently not making much income) should accept a home may not come for a while and invest more of my 18k knowing I cannot touch it for a while and would effect my ability to buy should a good opportunity arise in the next couple years?

383,OVID,"So, I don't think I can call myself an expert, but I can offer you my perspective on what is going on.

Broadly speaking, I feel that there are 2 different perspectives on looking at stocks.  These complement each other most of the time, but they don't necessarily always agree.  (Even calling them different perspectives is perhaps wrong, as their interplay is fundamental to the market.)

First viewpoint is that stocks are a tiny piece of a company.  As such, they are worth their proportion of all future profit of that company.  There are a couple of important details to note here.  To start with, money has time value.  Money today is worth more than the same amount next week.  This means that far future earnings are worth less then immediate earnings.  (My argument will hinge on exactly how much less.) Next, investors don't have perfect crystal balls to predict the future with.  This means that people or organizations need to make educated guesses as to how a company will grow and what its future profits will look like.  While you can look through earnings reports, cash flows, and balance sheets, but in the end there is a good degree of uncertainty to the prediction.  Furthermore, if a company is poorly managed, it might squander that money, failing to return it to investors or providing futher growth to the company.

Second viewpoint is that stocks are worth what people are willing to pay for them.  People or organizations are willing to buy or sell pieces of companies at particular valuations.  Stocks don't truly have inherent value; rather, the price that they trade at defines what they are worth.  Put another way, because you don't know the future of the company, the free market's pricing is the best way to set it's value. 

Now, in theory, these viewpoints work together.  The market's pricing of the stock is the communal best guess as to the company's future earnings.  But here's where investor psychology takes over-people react in certain ways to gaining or losing money.  People can overreact to bad news, underestimate risk, fail to see future growth opportunities, etc.  

To back this up a bit, we should again touch upon the idea of the time value of money.  We should look at what happens when the federal interest rate drops.  When interest rates drop, the percentage yield on US government bonds tends to drop with it.  Generally, this means that putting $100 away for a year in the safest place possible, (US Gov bonds...they're not perfectly safe, but if they aren't worth anything, stocks won't be either; you'll be measuring wealth in canned foods and bullets.) you gain less money than you would have previously.  In short, dropping the interest rate reduces the time value of money.  In turn, this means that future earnings of a company are worth proportionally more.  

Put it this way: would you rather put $100 in a government bond earning 5% for a year, or would you rather take some risk in the stock market that earns an average of 7% in a year?  Now, if government bonds earned 2% in a year while the stock market earns an average of 7% per year, would this potentially change your answer?  And what do you think the overall market would do?

In short, lowering interest rates lowered the time value of money, meaning that future earnings were discounted less.  In turn, this drives the theoretical value of stocks upward.  The market, made up of people and organizations, reacts by driving prices up.  This is because the market realizes that COVID earnings may be trash, but future earnings will probably recover at some point.  The FED raising interest rates is expected at some point, but not in the immediate future.  And to top it all off, with all these changes, some investors seem to have made some interesting assumptions as to the future of certain companies, leading to large swings in valuations for some stocks.  This is why stocks are up in spite of current economic turmoil.  

That's my 2 cents as to why we're here.  Just don't ask me where the stock market will go next.  Those crystal balls are apparently on backorder; I'm still waiting for mine to get here.",0.089,0.755,0.156,0.9952

Additional to this sentiment, is a greater number of individual investors with more access to trading, and a HUGE emphasis on squirreling away money that can't be spent on useless shit like Starbucks, movies, and other consumer discretionary. People can't spend money, are threatened by a possible economic situation that they expect will get better, so they invest it. Once consumer discretionary becomes viable again, the bubble will likely pop. But I expect Big Investment will see that coming and sell off prior, leading to a legit 20-30% decline.

486,ANY,"Ok. I see you are completely fresh. So my initial advice is to buy the S&P 500 index ETF like SPY blindly, just put whatever monthly % of your salary you want and don't look at any graphs for that. Put only the money you wont need for a long time, best until your retirement. A emergency savings nest before investing is great too, so you don't sell that investment in a need. This is that you would be in the market. Time in the market beats timing of the market. Don't trade, buy everything long term. If you invest in S&P 500 and can not sell for 20Y, historically, at whatever point you buy, holding for 20Y, you would never lose a penny. Market crashes happen, prices go up and down, but in the long term, it's a safest investment in stocks, as long as you don't sell when you go down, but just slowly month by month buy more.

Now when you do that. LEARN. You have very basic questions here. No day trading, trading, swing trading, options, none of that stuff. Just go to Plain Bagel Youtube channel and Investopedia and learn basic stuff about the stock market, how it works and why. Basic terminology, basic fundamental company analysis.

You need someone to buy your stocks, if you are selling and vice versa, so you need to wait. But there's market makers, when the market is open, not pre-market, or after-market, that give liquidity to the market, that make selling and buying very quick. Look up if you don't understand what I said.

Then when you can understand how everything works , the basics, look at more advanced stuff, like how to read company financial statements, fundamental analysis, stock multiples like P/E.

it's a valuation class from  Aswath Damodaran, a  Professor of Finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University. It's really great, but you need all the above to go to here, because the terminology wont make sense. But he does intrinsic value valuation, pricing of a stock comparing that stock to different same stocks, to determine if its undervalued, overvalued or priced well.

And just in short. Investing isn't hard, and you don't need to be smart. Buy a stock of a great company, that will do exceptionally well in the long term. And hold for a long term. Buy when it's low, not when everyone is already hyped about it and the price skyrocketing 100%, FOMO ( fear of missing out is very real i've lost a good amount doing this).

Buy when everyone fearful to buy, and keep it, not buy when everyone is talking and having gains in the hundreds percent. You need patience.

When you buy a stock, think as if you would be buying the whole business.

Charts are ok, but you can do investing and never look at a price chart, ever.

I use Interactive Brokers, as my investing platform/broker as a EU citizen, Robinhood is probably simplest broker in US,  and yahoo finance, for quick look at stock prices, Bloomberg or reuters for news, reuters also has financials of companies, just write the ticker in the search and open the company. You wont need anything more.

487,EARN,"Ok. I see you are completely fresh. So my initial advice is to buy the S&P 500 index ETF like SPY blindly, just put whatever monthly % of your salary you want and don't look at any graphs for that. Put only the money you wont need for a long time, best until your retirement. A emergency savings nest before investing is great too, so you don't sell that investment in a need. This is that you would be in the market. Time in the market beats timing of the market. Don't trade, buy everything long term. If you invest in S&P 500 and can not sell for 20Y, historically, at whatever point you buy, holding for 20Y, you would never lose a penny. Market crashes happen, prices go up and down, but in the long term, it's a safest investment in stocks, as long as you don't sell when you go down, but just slowly month by month buy more.

Now when you do that. LEARN. You have very basic questions here. No day trading, trading, swing trading, options, none of that stuff. Just go to Plain Bagel Youtube channel and Investopedia and learn basic stuff about the stock market, how it works and why. Basic terminology, basic fundamental company analysis.

You need someone to buy your stocks, if you are selling and vice versa, so you need to wait. But there's market makers, when the market is open, not pre-market, or after-market, that give liquidity to the market, that make selling and buying very quick. Look up if you don't understand what I said.

Then when you can understand how everything works , the basics, look at more advanced stuff, like how to read company financial statements, fundamental analysis, stock multiples like P/E.

I'd say from here you can go for single stocks, while still keeping your S&P 500 investment.

It is tax advantageous for companies to divest business lines like this by doing a spin-off/split-off (also know as a stock dividend to shareholders) rather than selling the business for cash (in which case they would be subject to a large tax bill if sold for a gain). 

In a typical ""spin-off"", each DuPont shareholder would get pro rata ownership in the N&B business that is being spun off and merging with IFF. This transaction is a bit different as it is a ""split off"" rather than a ""spin off"" - in essence, each DuPont shareholder will get the option as to whether they want to tender into the split (have their investment go with the N&B division which is merging with IFF) or decline the tender (and keep their investment in DuPont parent). They offer a premium for shareholders to tender into the split-off (the $107 vs. $100 delta) in order to incentivize shareholders to opt into the new deal and allow them to complete the transaction.

The key decision point for you should be - would you prefer to have $100 invested in DuPont parent or $107 invested into the new N&B/IFF merged company? Which do you think has more growth potential? Will there be synergies from the merger? Which will have the better mgmt team?",0.0,0.92,0.08,0.9581

When I short a stock, someone is ""loaning"" me a stock. I sell it now. Now I wait. 

If the stock goes down, I buy it back at a lower price and give it back. I've made a profit. If the stock goes up, I buy it back at a higher price and give it back. I've made a loss.

However, from the lender's side, why would I let you borrow my stock to short for free? I wouldn't. I would charge you interest. So the longer you hold the stock, the more you owe me in interest. This is why short positions are short in time.

So if the price of a stock is going up, and won't stop going up, you'll lose twice. You'll lose on interest AND on the extra you'd have to pay to get it back. This means you'll probably buy back early to cut your losses, unless your pockets are REALLY deep.

The price of the stock is usually independent of my short action. Especially if the volume of shorting is small compared to shares being traded.

However, it's public information how many shares are being shorted. The % of shares being shorted to total shares outstanding is the ""short interest"".

If this short interest is high, a third party might see a lot of people believe the stock will go down, and either try to exit and sell, or avoid buying, lowering the price. This is supply and demand in conjunction with human psychology.

On the flip side... GME today.

The short interest was over 100%. That means there were more shares shorted than shares available. This should remind you of debt crises, because that's what this is.

This occurs when someone shorts a share, someone buys the shorted stock, and lends it out again. The same share is being loaned out twice, and the second lender isn't paying attention. 

If this repeats a lot, short interest exceeds 100%. 

Now, if a bunch of retail investors... say on WSB's, collectively decide they like a company, they can start pushing the price up as they all buy. 

The people shorting the stock suddenly need to to also buy back the shares to cut losses. 

So we've got short sellers covering losses, and WSB also buying. 

The only way for supply to increase to match the spike in demand is to raise prices, so more people are willing to cash out.

The short interest was over 100%. That means there were more shares shorted than shares available. This should remind you of debt crises, because that's what this is.

This occurs when someone shorts a share, someone buys the shorted stock, and lends it out again. The same share is being loaned out twice, and the second lender isn't paying attention. 

If this repeats a lot, short interest exceeds 100%. 

Now, if a bunch of retail investors... say on WSB's, collectively decide they like a company, they can start pushing the price up as they all buy. 

The people shorting the stock suddenly need to to also buy back the shares to cut losses. 

So we've got short sellers covering losses, and WSB also buying. 

The only way for supply to increase to match the spike in demand is to raise prices, so more people are willing to cash out.

And you get what happened to GME today.",0.073,0.801,0.126,0.9753

For something highly liquid (many buyers and sellers) like Apple stock or spy etf you can sell it pretty much for what the last person sold it for.

Y’all might be mad you’re not on the GME squeeze, but let’s not pretend all of investing isn’t gambling with the potential to lose your money.
