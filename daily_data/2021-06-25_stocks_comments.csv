51,VG," VG is targeting suborbital human flight. VG's feathering reentry only works because the spacecraft is suborbital (it isn't traveling at orbital velocities). Like their launch system, their reentry system does not scale to orbital human space flight. This is one of their greatest weakness. If VG decides to try to compete in orbital human flight, they'll have start from scratch.

SpaceX is already doing orbital flight and and they are looking beyond that. Blue Origin's orbit rocket New Glenn, is building on their suborbital rocket New Shepard. VG isn't a competitor in orbital flight. 


The market for suborbital flight is limited by the future success of SpaceX, Blue Origin, and others. If they are successful in reducing the cost to orbit, then VG's market dries up.

I'm a fan of VG, and wish them luck. I even bought some shares early on. I sold those shares and I'm happy with my profit. But betting of VG long term as a launch provider is betting against SpaceX. And that's not a good bet.

>there still using rockets and fighting the atmosphere on re-entry

But maybe I want to jump in and ride gains now or perhaps soon? At that point one could use any sort of fundamental analysis to come up with yet another number they may or may not be comfortable with.

Ok, well obviously others with more money than me think its worth more than it currently is, so maybe I'll buy now if everything looks acceptable on the DD front?

79,AEO," Retail as a whole is doing really well right now. I think traders and investors are responding to really good consumer spending data that we're seeing.

AEO (American Eagle) up 15% in one week, on really good indicators that people are going to spending for work, summer and back to school.

Their Aerie line is firing on all cylinders. 80% yoy growth. 150% plus e-commerce growth. I've said this before, but I really think they can **overtake Victoria's Secret for number one in the women's underwear, swim and lingerie category in 5-7 years.** In addition, their OFFL/NE athleisure spin-off is a legitimate value alternative to Lululemon and Athleta, and I expect it to grow at the same pace as Target's All in Motion line. I know for a fact from girlfriends that their bike shorts are selling really well. I love the branding, sounds a little like OFF-WHITE, but I'm cool with that. Also love their tag line ""Built for real motion"" which is a direct bullseye shot at Target's line.

We are entering the first jeans supercycle we've seen in 20 years, as skinnies have dominated the landscape since we bought that first Strokes CD in 2001, and yoga pants have dominated the last 5-7 years. Time to clear out your old wardrobes, and replace those skinnies with the relaxed styles we saw from the late 1970s through the late 90s. I seel AEO as really well positioned here, as we are in the beginning stages of this cycle, and we still don't really know what type of style will dominate. Flares? High waisted ""mom"" styles? Mid 90s wide legs? Late 90s boot cuts? Relaxed Levis 501 styles? Fortunately, AEO has styles in all of these categories.

Valuation wise, retail as a whole is good, with the category lagging the entire S&P in forward P/E and FCF yield, as they have really really been hit hard over the past five years due to the pandemic and the closing of malls. Only Oil and Gas as a broad-based category has been hit harder. Those who transition the fastest to e-commerce in this beaten down category will win. Fortunately, Shopify now makes it really really easy for most retailers to pivot quickly.

Valuation wise, among the sector, AEO has a lower forward P/E than peers Abercrombie and Fitch, Levis, L Brands, Lulu, GAP. They also have had better e-commerce execution than all of them with exception of Lulu.

850M cash on hand, a 100% increase from 2020, with 330M in long term debt, a 50% decline from 2020. 282M ttm free cash flow against a 5.8B enterprise value (EV/fcf of 20, which I think is low for a company with a growth machine like Aerie). Pretty good financials.

Stores, which are still mainly located in enclosed malls, will be a drag, but continued closing of underperforming/low foot traffic stores, opening of new leases in multi-use urban or urban-adjacent outdoor ""malls"" or high streets (you know, the places that have an Apple store), and shifting to a asset-light e-commerce model servicing suburb/exurb/rural areas will help them overcome this.

Leadership wise, CEO/Chairman Schottenstein is a good financial guardian and head, but the real secret sauce comes from Chief Creative Officer Jennifer Foyle, who's a real superstar. Expect her to be considered for the CEO role if Aerie can execute to the highest levels and become the largest intimates brand in the US.

224,FL," Remember a large part of what is keeping people from going back to work is the Federal Unemployment Benefits Extension (an additional $300 a week) which in some states means unemployment benefits are more than doubled.  For example, in FL unemployment benefits are maxed out at $275 a week, but with the federal money that gets bumped up to $575 a week.

That gravy train is set to run out in September through unless they extend it yet again.

Edited to add that FL's unemployment is maxed out at $275, there are probably people who collect even less than that.

225,IMO," I really should do something more with stocks.  I went to Bentley, used their little trading room.   That was a long time ago and I have 401k's and Roths with my buddy.  He's series 6 and all that jazz.  Owns his own company as a Financial advisor.

I am trying to more understand what is going on with the Feds and interest rates.  I think they might be concerned about a bunch of people retiring in 25 years with next to nothing.   Social Security cannot support an overwhelming % of people having next to nothing for retirement.

Having that conversation opens up crazy internet conversations though.  Any time I talk about the Millennials struggling it always brings up debates on student loan write offs, just go to work, don't expect handouts, etc.  I work 50 hours/week and take $2-400 out of savings to pay rent.  I think there is a large group in the same camp.  It's basically a growing wealth gap and shrinking of the middle class.  

Further, I am obviously in the camp that thinks there will be a growing labor shortage as many Millennials just give up.  I think that we will see a continuous exit of people from the job market, or a downward trend, over a long timeline.  Something that I do not think most traders are considering (my buddy was very adamant that I am stupid lol).

How would the government and stock market reflect on that?  I think the answer is companies will automate the low pay jobs out and get more productivity with less people.

However, that may provide a direct conflict with the government's long term thinking.  At least IMO.

I am actually seeing the opposite believe it or not.  Which is precisely the reason I am creating this topic and getting concerned.  When only 1 person on the internet is saying it it cannot be true, right?  ;)

We have I think 26 states that have ended or will very soon end at least the $300 benefit.  Indeed just released a survey that in the states where that benefit has ended job searches are actually down.  Which is the opposite of what you expect when these benefits go away.

My goal is not to say it's the case but nearly to point out the possibility that we may not see a lot of these people return to the workforce.  Baby Boomers have retired, as an example.  We see the odd #'s for Apr/May jobs reports.  Why is the gov't acting the way they are RE rate hikes?

I could be wrong.  I  hope I am wrong.  I likely am wrong.  I think the June jobs report is 7/2?  Maybe I am giving something interesting to think about when we see those numbers.

If they can pull off their vision of sitting on the couch, as you change the channel it switches betting sheets and make the whole experience really interactive then they will do well. Their advertising revenue is also growing and is already above industry standards.

In terms of management, a lot of the exec are ex-warner brothers and know the core business well. So far they have exceeded what they promised.

272,SOFI," They started off as giving out loans to well educated college students at attractive interest rates (doctors, lawyers, and so on) because they perceived the risk to be less. This drew in the younger generation but they pivoted away from that and their vision now is to be ""Amazon of banking"".

1. According to their research they believe that a) banks are doing a poor job of offering quality digital interface and b) people have multiple banks/accounts because they all their needs aren't met at one bank. 

2. They invested into their digital platform so they can draw in the younger generations who prefer comfort/convenience. Why go to a bank and talk to a rep and get a loan when you can get the same terms on SOFI without leaving the house...similar to why go to a restaurant and pick it up when you can order ubereats. 

3. To be the amazon of banking you need to be vertically integrated, offer a breadth of products, and be the first to market. 

4. They are doing this by obtaining a bank charter (so they can offer better loans and better terms), obtained Galileo (which is the frameworks neo banks like robinhood use). They don't want to specialize in one sector but rather offer a lot and draw in more customers and then improve their services down the road. 

5. Their MOAT? What sets them apart? They are one of the few first to market...while lot of companies are specializing in one area they have done a great job of casting a wider net to capture more. Growing at great rate. Their margins are lower. They have good cash flow and revenues. Great management.

'fundamental analysis' is far more important, which examines the financial status of a company. for example, see the following books all by successful investors: 

- The Most Important Thing, by Howard Marks. very little discussion of chart reading, other than to say he doesn't rely on it too often. 

- The Little Book that Beats the Market, but Joel Greenblatt. focuses on two methods of fundamental analysis, finding stocks with low ""price to earnings"" ratio and high ""return on capital."" looking for stocks that are under-valued (like buying $5 for $2.50), but are good at turning assets into profits. zero chart reading. 

- The Little Book of Value Investing, by Christopher Browne. 100% fundamental analysis. 

- One Up on Wall Street and Beating the Street, by Peter Lynch. mostly focused on fundamentals, with a bit of chart analysis.",harrison_wintergreen,3,/r/stocks/comments/o7sffa/best_intro_to_technical_analysis_and_charting/h30r8a4/,0.039,0.836,0.125,0.9393
