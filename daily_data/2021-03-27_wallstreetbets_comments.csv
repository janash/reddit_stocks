They allow you to trade shares for free whilst other brokers charge fees or sell user data like payment order flow, or lend out stocks that their users have bought. 

Freetrade does none of that bullshit, they just have some features and some stocks available only to plus users who pay 9.99 a month. This suppotts the entire business and allows them to have a free tier for users that don't want to pay the subscription.

If you trade a few stocks a month then you actually save money with freetrade as you won't be paying any broker fees to trade each stock.

People touting ""$1 000 000 per share"" are obviously blind. Nobody is getting $1 000 000 for one gamestop share.

This advice is fundamentally wrong - most Americans can now get margin at a 2.5% fee rate which is incredible value when used responsibly. This type of advice is equivalent to saying you shouldn't own a credit card because you might get slapped with 30% APR if you forget to pay your bills. Meanwhile, using a credit card means you can get cashback (literal free money) and other intangible benefits like fraud protection and being able to keep a larger cash reserve over an intramonth period.

Don't max out your margins. Don't use it on stocks that have ""high"" beta (definition of high depends on your risk tolerance).

I'm new to the casino and would like to learn more. However, I do have some money in GME so if that means I'm unable to compete, I'd rather that than a ban.

I'm a newish programmer with 30k worth of debt (slowly working it off, now I have an adult job), so I can't make some big balled moves like other retards on this site. As such this paper trading seems like a fun way to learn.

In my case ‚Äî the loan documents contain very draconian terms and conditions about what I‚Äôm responsible... which may never be triggered, and exist to protect the bank; mitigate their risk

Some are what they are

Others ‚Äî since I have consolidated with them and they can see everything ‚Äî can be mitigated in different ways and be removed.

Lawyers do this, but some are simpler

Example: 

I will not sign a personal guarantee. I‚Äôd rather the loan get declined and address the reasons why.

If I‚Äôm required to, I will move everything to a bank that doesn‚Äôt require it. It‚Äôs the fastest way to lose an good long term customer IMO, particularly when many are written to try and recover everything beyond liquidation value ‚Äî including projected profit - for the loan. 

especially on a debt already secured by a property ...so after some back and forth, their underwriters agree to remove it

Based on bank relationship, if you pledge a CD for 5 years for $xxxxx, etc

In my case ‚Äî for what I want to do ‚Äî I don‚Äôt need a PG and remove a liability by paying the property off ‚Äî everyone is happy. I can probably get a bigger loan I‚Äôd I rent it out and have a signed rental agreement.

Started because I redlined the clause, and was reasonable with my asks.

349,GME," A gamma squeeze, by its very nature, is short lived.

Imagine a bunch of people buy OTM calls for cheap.

As the stock price increases, the MMs need to hedge by buying stock. 

As the MM buys stock, the price increases, which makes more calls closer to being ITM.

As a result, they need to hedge for the next set of calls. Rinse repeat.

Eventually, there aren‚Äôt enough calls or the option chain tops out.

Once that happens, the market maker unloads all the shares.

The situation I‚Äôm hoping to see is a failure to deliver / short squeeze. This is a bubble but it can go MUCH higher. 

I don‚Äôt believe the SI is accurate. At all. They ran out of shares on iborrow and shorted the entire Russell 2000.

374,DD," So I made my own cup and handle - stay with me crayon lickers
1st - I drank my morning coffee 

2nd- used the tea spoon that I add my sugar with as my cup -bent the handle upwards 42 degrees.

3rd - went to the junk drawer and found duct tape 

4th- grabbed wife‚Äôs wooden spoon ( she may or may not know I‚Äôm using it as I‚Äôm not allowed to play with her things )  and taped it to original tea spoon bent at 42.0 degrees

416,AMC," I didn't do a ton of DD.  I have monkey palms and it is hard to click the keyboard.

But, if you look at their history before Covid they are good for 15 - 20 dollar a share.  At one point 30.  Plus there is the short argument.  I do not know enough about shorting to get into it.  But, on top of their usual pre covid stock price there is the fact that there is just a ton of activity around AMC right now.

It all really depends on what the government says.  If they open the doors for Movie theaters then Both Cinemark and AMC would go up.  I am not saying it is going to the moon.

423,GME," I had this same understanding when I heard this story. There is a connection between Melvin and Jordan,  then there is Jordan loosing a shit ton of money. I think people just assumed Jordan was investing with Melvin and came to the conclusion that he was short GME via investing in Melvin Capital... That's the closest assumption that could have any validity based on what is known. 

I think it is entirely unfair  and wrong to say ""Michale Jordan was shorting GameStop"" as if he himself was. I think the biggest leap that can be made would be that after doing the deal with Plotkin, Jordan decided to invest part of his fund into Melvin Capital, or inversely, he had already had an investment with Melvin Capital, which led to the hornet's deal. Either way, I don't like the hate being thrown at Jordan, I'm not necessarily a fan, I'm a hockey guy tbh, but it's not a to d look for the community, attacking Celebrity's and athletes, based on their investment strategies that we don't know all the deal details on.",r6raff,23,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/medswq/michael_jordan_has_no_proven_connection_to/gsgvi96/,0.077,0.912,0.011,-0.8663

They‚Äôve got an entire AI + Machine Learning suite of products to protect everything from devices to networks and everything in between.  Head to head competition is proving they have THE best product on the market.

The catalyst is the marketing campaign and roll out that starts in the NY Times this Sunday.

495,GME," I know a guy who showed me his books. He bought every low wave MACD share he could and would limit sell them for a 20% gain. Over eight years, the dude has nearly $125,500,000 in value, most of it is in ETFs now. The dude is 26. Talks about how he misses working because his days are incredibly boring and long. 

He's absolutely rich, but he acts like he works an average salary job and spends less than $2,500 a month. In a phone call with him, he pulled into a McDonald's drive through and ordered off the cheap side of the menu. His house isn't glorious or anything either.

The dude has the tendies, but lives like the rest of us. He wears stuff he can buy at Walmart, eats microwave meals, and drives an early 2010's Volkswagen Golf too. 

The only 'rich' thing I've seen him do is join the GME fight with 100k shares at $121.54 the other day. He groaned about having to withdraw from his ETF pool for it, but he openly stated that he has no intention to sell GME even if it breaks $1,000 per share.

532,DD," Hmm yesterday a fellow german ape did some DD about put/ call options which expire today for GME.

Most calls were OTM at a strike price of 200$ or higher. Most puts were OTM at a strike price of 100$ or less.

He tried to find the price where most PUT and Call options are otm.
It was around 180$.

When the price closed at around 180$ today, I was quite surprised.

Possible explanation?

1. Options have a very huge influance on the price. (Especially right before they expire?)

2. MM take huge profits, when most options are OTM.
So maybe market manipulation?

3. Coincidence?

If Cohen had just opened an Amazon storefront, Chewy would probably function just about identically to how it does now for the end consumer. Only difference is that Cohen was able to sell his business to Petsmart for a bunch of money, while an Amazon storefront has to make money by actually selling product.

66% of Chewy's revenue also comes from monthly subscriptions for the same product.
With GME, gamers already buy their computer parts online and gamers don't buy the same product every month.

631,GME," There are currently about 50 million GME shares available for public trading, and at least 10 million shares shorted. As you probably know shorting means that an investor borrowed a share from someone and has to give it back eventually. There are several mechanisms that could force those investors to cover and close out their short positions, and if that happens they'll have to buy off the market at whatever the current price is. If the shares they need to buy are held by investors that just want to make a quick buck they can just buy and be done with it. They'll take a beating but then it's over. But apes aren't normal investors, they're in it for the squeeze. They can't force you to sell so if they try to buy and nobody's selling all they can do is offer more and more money until someone cracks. The more apes there are holding for the moon the higher that number goes.

This is very simplified but more or less the idea. More apes holding more of the available float makes a squeeze more likely, and makes it likely the squeeze will be huge when it finally happens.",animu_manimu,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/me13xm/dd_part_2_i_counted_all_the_wallstreetbets_gme/gse9md7/,0.01,0.931,0.059,0.714

GME 

- Shares outstanding (all classes) 69.94 (nice) 

- Float 54.17

- institutional and fund ownership (biggest ones) 72.15

And then you should count retail and smaller holders. 

So what's the real float if top institutions owns more shares that there ever is issued?

I know its now less then a month away, but if I did that on March 16th, 800 divided by 15000 means that I am making 5.3333% return a month if it never hits $7.5... 5.333333% X 12 is a pretty good annual return by most metrics.

759,USA," mexico native and resident here!

whatever you think of the mexican gov is probably wrong. Our goverment is easily the worst in the region and every fucking day they come up with some bullshit to undermind both global and regional business.

From trying to block the operation of foreign-funded power plants (as to return to a gov controlled monopoly) to daily accusations of mischieve and fraud from the fucking useless president (Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador) to anyone or anything under the sun.

Doing business in Mexico is quite risky right now. I would advice to review your info with a focus on how can Mexico fuck this shit up because we will.

If you think Trump was a POS, Lopez is quite the rival but he's also uber useless for Mexico's growth. Trump might have been and idiot, ignorant, swapy rat but at least he allowed the USA to keep on doing business, that won't happen in Mexico.

Also $KSU continously gets the rail road block by some fucking idiots demanding social change. At times, their trains will be completely stoped by a month or so and once the mid term elections in June go down, if the political party of the current president wins the Michoacan state it will only get absolutely fucking worst.

Again, Mexican ape over here, i've seen it with my own eyes, i wouldn't trust this goverment to do anything to change our precarious conditions, if anything they'll just make it worse.
