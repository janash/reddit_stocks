19,ATOS," I think ATOS is a good option. Otherwise I'm reading up on the weed stocks recommend on another top post a couple days ago. the two top ones were DBCCF and EXPFF but then a lot of people chimed in  and I have maybe 2 dozen weed penny stocks I'm looking at for day or swing trades. 

Not that you should listen to me but currently, so far, I'm concentrating on reading about:

DBCCF

EXPFF 

HCANF (super risky but the swing looks juicy)

ERBB

GBLX

INQD

NUGS

and AXIM. 

I want to keep an eye on WLDF' swings and I might consider BLDV if it drops to .0021.


(Note: these are all short term for me. and I'm specifically focusing on this week.)

if anyone loves or hates any of these, tell me why.


editing comment:

I used the stockinvest site to see trends and look at trading volatility. I wanted stocks that looked like they had price point floors close to the current closing price on Friday, *and* I wanted trading volatility to be at 10% or above (preferably 18%+.)

so my current list to read more on includes:

GGII

GBLX

INQD

LVVV

AGFAF

AXIM

EXPFF

GGTTF


and I still like ATOS even though I worry about it being a 1-3 month stock. But it seems like there's enough volatility there to make this a good short term buy to keep jumping in and out of.",CuckooForCovidPuffs,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/ohb0gn/the_loungedaily_plays_july_10_2021/h4qai2x/,0.04,0.851,0.108,0.9287

At the time the market was still at essentially its high (February) and the company was still sending positive information that their reverse merger was happening. I'd describe it more as being a P&D loss paired with sunk cost fallacy (not cashing out at a loss). Deliberately exaggerated claims from insiders and things like DD on Reddit.
