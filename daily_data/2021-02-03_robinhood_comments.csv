Nakd bought at $.82 now $0.91 nok bought at $8 now $4 and then about $150 of cash value. Today when I checked RH it told me I had a deficit of $90 where did that come from?

534,AMC," **REZZF/GBML Lithium mine play with extremely low market cap ($14.59M)**  


So, we're all pretty rundown with all this GME and AMC stuff atm. But its time to kickback and get back into something we can all get behind. Sweet Sweet lithium.

The DD: Lithium exploration company with sites based in Lenister (Ireland). project area covers 477.39 km2. On January 21, 2021, the company was given permission by its board of directors to start drilling.

Initial surveys of the site concluded lithium stream sediment recorded mostly in the 125-1000ppm range vs the 60-120ppm range for other nearby mines (China's Avalonia project also located in ireland)

This area of land is very geopolitically stable and does not suffer the same turmoil and problems as similar land located in Africa and South America.

Additionally, the company is looking to sell a mining plot. Through Minas Dixon, GBML’s/REZZF 55% owned Peruvian subsidiary has granted Minsur the option to acquire a 1800 hectare property (Lara), A copper mine in Peru.

Financials:  
Has had a modest recent run up (30% yesterday) but due to a public offering that dropped the stock price (Jan 25th) i believe this has a long way to go.

The market cap only sits at ($14.59M), a tiny price cap if you consider some other lithium plays (KODAL for example has a market cap on 1Bn and has also yet to produce any lithium).

Good assets to liabilities of 40.3%

I could see this stock hitting 0.8 by the end of next week (100% increase)

CEO and Insider trades: CEO Mr. Murphy is a founder of Torex Gold (TXG-T) a 1.46Bn market cap compnay. Mr. Murphy was responsible for identifying the Morelos Gold asset from Teck, negotiating the sale from Teck in a very competitive environment, arranging the $240million+ financing, and was very involved in recruiting the board and management.

\-90,000 shares sold through insider trades between jan-feb this year ( a tiny amount) +560,000 of options brought by company members in October 2020.

Overall, this is ultimately a long term play but i can see a lot of movement in short term when forums get a hold of this (recently added to 212) and when the drilling in Ireland Starts.

If; theoretically speaking of course, this CEO can get this company to a level anywhere near the gold company he set up; with purchases of more sites etc, we could be looking at a 7000% increase in the share value over the next 10 years. Personally, i could see the market cap of this company reaching $30Mil soon.",KorruptDj,0,/r/RobinHood/comments/lbl608/daily_discussion_thread_february_3rd_2021/glwhhla/,0.017,0.875,0.108,0.9866

According to Fidelity, this has been happening a lot. It sounds like RH might be assigning margin status to accounts and loaning stock out on the sly, and that’s why the short positions are there.

563,RH, It has been a while since the last time I put money on Robinhood. I believe it was around September so unsettled funds isn’t the problem. Webull says the transfer has been complete. This is nerve wrecking idk whats going on and the support on both sides are almost non-existent. Idk why I have negative cash on RH. I’m guessing its because of the transfer fee but the numbers doesn’t make sense. I saw a transfer history from Webull of -$75 so that should be the transfer fee from RH.
