7,ON," This is a snippet from an article in 2010 showing exactly why she should not be involved.

REP. WATERS CHARGED ON THREE COUNTS

The House ethics committee on Monday outlined its charges against Rep. Maxine Waters, who is accused of helping a bank in which her husband owned stock secure federal bailout funds.
The committee charged the 10-term California Democrat with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code in connection with her effort to arrange a 2008 meeting between Treasury officials and representatives with OneUnited bank.
The panel said Waters, who sits on the Financial Services Committee, broke a House rule requiring members to behave in a way that reflects ""creditably"" on the chamber. The committee said that by trying to assist OneUnited, she stood to benefit directly, because her husband owned a sizable amount of stock that would have been ""worthless"" if the bank failed.
The committee also accused Waters of violating the ""spirit"" of a House rule prohibiting lawmakers from using their positions for financial gain, as well as a government ethics statute banning the dispensing of ""special favors.""",Rare_Invite,43,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc1udz/udeepfuckingvalue_is_being_asked_to_testify_in/glxsyha/,0.125,0.788,0.087,-0.7739

If he purchased all shares for sale another short squeeze would be inevitable as no shorts could be covered as all stocks for sale would be held. We would not sell.. as we have not..  and we could all cash out a decent profit before the short squeeze is over and keep a few shares in there. The price would fluctuate back to normal and then keep increasing as papa tusk would literally drive that company to be the absolute fucking MOON status within a few years... easily. So.

63,USA," Original quote adapted from : 'I am become death, destroyer of worlds.""

 This quote is often attributed to Oppenheimer on the occasion of the first successful nuclear test, the Trinity test in New Mexico in 1945, after which USA President Truman authorized the atomic bombings of the cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, killing well over 200,000 men, women and children. It is not clear whether Oppenheimer used these words at the time of the test or at a later date, but in fact he was recalling and translating the words of Vishnu in the Hindu scripture the Bhagavad-Gita.

In a 1965 television broadcast about the moments following the Trinity test, Oppenheimer said: ""We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty, and, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says, 'Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.' I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.""",io-io-io,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcfwrd/is_musk_going_to_buy_gme/gm0e5b4/,0.106,0.827,0.067,-0.8419

Musk is not going to buy GME, billionaires are not dumb. They don't buy into hype meme stocks, they actually buy puts when a stock goes up 1000% in a few days.

The most ironic thing is that with the vast majority of the GME float being institutionally owned (109% of the float including synthetic longs), the people buying in at $300 as Musk was hyping it up to keep himself in the news were likely buying it from the biggest funds on Wall Steet like Blackrock, whose average booked acquisition price was $19/share.

The part where China takes over but then almost immediately collapse under its own systemic problem, the rise of Eastern Europe as the place where most green energies were experimented on in large societal scale (it wasn't electric cars, it was a dumb idea to think batteries could survive all climates for long period of charging and discharging...) or the restoration of the empire of Brazil? Or if you prefer sooner, I have Tesla overreacting downward after they try to split yet again and the price fell by 65%. I forgot if that was in 2022 or 2023. Before 2025 for sure because I got divorced that year.

Perhaps I can interest you in the next GME perhaps?

There was one planned (it was a weed company...not not fucki\*g S\*pennystockcensordship\*L...scrub) but in, IIRC 2021, the SEC imposed that retail brokers should ask for a minimum 25k deposit which was later increased to 50k. At 25k only those with previous tendies or good jobs could trade but the majority of dumb money and fractionals were out. At 50k pretty much only boomers and upper middle class left (pretty risk averse people). The stock never even took off (1 day at +35% after being down 10% and 15% is not mooning, Georges or whatever your reddit handle was/will be...)

WSB climbed to 11.5 mill members but most of the active users that made the ""impressive dumb plays"" moved on. I had completely forgotten about DFV but I guess he lived the rest of his life peaceably. He did gripe years later on twitter about how ppl overestimate his wealth because numbers were pre-tax and exaggerated.

Surprisingly 4chan became less tolerant than instagram about minors nudity but I think that was foreseeable in 2018 already so I can't take credit there.

161,GME," I think the echo chamber of Reddit really hides the fact that the odds of you striking true gold in a subreddit of millions is still one in a million. Like yea...some dude now has 8 figures from trading GME. That doesn't mean *you* will also be a millionaire if you bet it all on GME just because you sub to the same community.

Your likelihood of striking gold on a stock that several people already know about having insane volatility and potential upside is about the same as the odds of winning big on a scratcher. But because you can make a post that shows up right above the big winners' posts, there is an equalizing factor that makes folks think there is truly no difference between an incredibly lucky person and themselves.

In trading, there must be winners and there must be losers. The losers often buy too late or sell too soon because they can't afford to keep sitting at the table. Playing the odds with an amount that will bankrupt you ultimately decreases your likelihood of making any money at all. I personally think it could be a combination of both in this case.

Many of the over leveraged folks bought the news at the top and watched it tank. Now that they had to sell, market makers can use the pessimism to sell puts that will enable them to trade this thing sideways or up again while using people betting on it's demise to actually cover their short positions.

183,GME," TL;DR: I don‚Äôt blame people for being frustrated that their late investment into GME didn‚Äôt pay off (yet?). I don‚Äôt support the deflection of blame to those who got out at the right time, but I also struggle to fully condemn those who feel shafted. Yes, many investors made a mistake by entering the market with unreasonable expectations and with money they couldn‚Äôt afford to lose. Still, I can understand why, given the amount of hype in WSB last week and the fact that rational discussion was largely buried under memes and rocket emojis.

I would bet a lot of those retarded moves were made by people browsing this subreddit and reading seemingly intelligent comments about GME reaching 1-10k per share. 

In other words, the group telling everyone to hold is the same group (though not necessarily the same members of that group) that told everyone to get in at 2-300 per share - that it was better to be late to the party than to miss out on the opportunity. 

To be fair, there was plenty of solid advice in the various hype threads. Many of the comments I saw warned potential investors to use only money that they could do without - that it was just as, if not more, likely that the GME position would fall through the floor.

Yes, there was reasonable advice aplenty during this time. Unfortunately, reasonable advice isn‚Äôt flashy - it doesn‚Äôt inspire upvotes as much as ‚Äúto the moon‚Äù and ‚ÄúüíéüíéüíéüöÄüöÄüöÄ‚Äù. I often had to dig fairly deep into comment sections to find sensible responses to questions like ‚Äúcould GME really end up at $10k per share?‚Äù

I do agree that anyone who bought in last week expecting GME to be their meal ticket made a terrible mistake. If you show up at a house party at 1am, don‚Äôt be surprised when the kegs are ~~tapped~~ **floated**^+, the girls are gone, and the sirens are slowly growing louder. 

At the same time, I also kind of get it. I was caught up in the hype last week too, running numbers on various what-if scenarios as I read through comments attempting to explain how GME will skyrocket. I found myself checking GME throughout the day, making mental checkpoints for my own what-if scenarios (‚Äúif I bought at 12:30, I‚Äôd be up X$ and I‚Äôd need XXX$ per share to double my investment‚Äù). 

Personally, I was looking at my potential investment in the same way my dad taught me to look at casinos: like an expensive amusement park. You‚Äôre paying for entertainment - treat the money you bring in like the entry fee for that entertainment and, win or lose, you‚Äôll leave happy.

Following that advice meant I would never have overextended myself on the stock, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I wouldn‚Äôt have entered the market with unreasonable expectations. The allure of being a part of something huge combined with the hesitancy of ‚Äúmissing out‚Äù on a chance to basically print money was enticing, making it difficult to keep emotion from clouding your judgement.

In the end, I acknowledged my own ignorance about what was actually going on with the stock and decided against it. Still, I can understand why people jumped in last week, and I can understand why many of them might feel frustration and annoyance at anyone who sold shares. They paid the cover hoping to get drunk and hook up and instead found themselves lying in the bushes in the back yard, praying that the party starts back up when the cops leave. 

I don‚Äôt condone throwing empty beer cans and people who are scrambling away from the party. But I can at least understand the impulse, considering those same people were insisting a midnight drive was totally worth it not an hour ago.

^+ Edit: You know you‚Äôre getting older when someone corrects your use of ‚Äútapped‚Äù instead of ‚Äúfloated‚Äù to describe an empty keg and your first thought is ‚Äúah is that what the kids are calling it these days?‚Äù",ohyeawellyousuck,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc6ej8/tweet_from_mark_cuban_and_we_all_have_to_respect/glz52pn/,0.097,0.753,0.15,0.9929

net long because they have not closed their short position. the short covering they will do will push the stock to the moon but at the same time since they are net long, they will gain from this move.

again, they're net long. being net long does not mean you have covered already. they probably built their net long position by buying calls over the past 3 days they have been shorting.

they've been buying deep in the money calls while pushing the stock price down so that they get the calls at a low premium.

That's a good sign imo.

Plus the renewed publicity that will come in the next couple weeks with the lawsuits/public hearings. I think there's heavy manipulation still ongoing because hedgies aren't out of the woods yet despite leaking press info that indicates they've all closed. It's a very very easy strategic decision for them to just lie and save money than to tell the truth and keep losing astronomically. And though restrictions have eased, they're still restricted. Plus most GME-ers have probably (hopefully) transferred from RH by now anyway, so I don't even know how much of an impact their restriction easing will have at this point in the game.

Things being closed/partly-closed isn't ideal but it does give these companies time to restructure without being in-flight, which will save them money and allow them to implement big changes with minimal headaches. 

The hedges can only manipulate the market for so long and as things to start to become more 100% operational I imagine it will be harder to do so.  The best thing we can do right now is hold. It's a war of attrition and we are on the front-foot. We just need to hold and not be discouraged by red.

I fully believe that Gamestop and AMC will take this investment as a second-chance and pivot to e-sports and global chain of arcade bars, as discussed in the parent comment.

701,TV," Here is a thing about Cuban's comment.  He said 'If you can afford to do it, I think you should hold the stock.'
  
While that is not financial advice, it strongly implies that he thinks it would be profitable to do so. 
  
If that is really what he thinks, then *why did he not buy in when he said that*?  Why are people so apt to suck the dicks of rich people who say things they like whist at the same time, calling for the heads on a pike of rich people who say things they do not like?  People with his kind of money live almost literally in a different reality than we do.  Their musings (that are not backed up by actions) do so much to change the world *only because we listen to them*.  People are here posing 'Eat the Rich' memes, but do not recognize that Cuban and Musk fall into that same category.
  
This is actually a serious question.  If Mark Cuban is so hot for people to hold it, why would he not buy it?  **He specifically said he does not own any.**  His public face is working a TV show where he literally invests in things he thinks will be profitable.  If he REALLY were to follow his own advice, he would have bought in.  He could literally have said  'This is not financial advice but, I think that if you can afford to do it, you should hold the stock.  That's why I bought 10,000 an hour ago.'
  
And Musk ain't gonna do shit.  Just because he tweeted some weird ass thing about being a destroyer of shorts means nothing.  Musk loves tweeting bizarre shit more than he loves jerking off.  Because when he jerks off, only about 23 people know about it.  When he tweets bizarre shit, the whole world jerks off with him.  He is an attention whore at its finest.  Bad attention, good attention, either one gets his rocks off in a way that cannot be matched.

They're working hard right now to make sure you won't be able to. This was a once in a lifetime chance (part of why I FOMO'd and lost everything). Please whatever you do, don't buy any other stock because you think there will be a repeat. Only buy if you think it will go up long term. There's still a chance for GME itself, though, because they almost certainly still have their toxic short positions (even if they might have balanced many of them with new, higher targeted ones). There's still a very slim chance to get GME to $10k on a short squeeze and make them pay out trillions to us.

Basically you can prime people through various incentives to play ball with the establishment and agree with their narrative. That's why beating us down was so important to them: They need to send a clear message that we can't win against them, and they need to create a social environment where people who try to work against the establishment narrative are shunned.

His employer doesn't care. He's getting fired, and that's them done. He, on the other hand, might have lied when signing up for whatever he was trading on.

Congress isn't going to do anything but ask questions. ""Hearing"" may sound like a legal throw down is gonna happen, but it's just another term for ""meeting"". 

All he did was look up information, which was part of his job. And they would know about the GME deal anyway, because they all knew about it. They pay people to look for stuff just like this.

801,GME," I think it's reasonable to speculate that there were retail short sellers above 200 selling GME. If there are retail traders that sold GME short then eventually they have to buy back in. The question is do they cover here now or do they think the price has more downside and so they wait longer to cover.

 The gamble in that is what if retard strength intensifies and the internet memes GME back up to 200 in that case it would be retail getting short squeezed. It wouldn't be nearly as intense but it's nice as a üíéüëê bag holder to speculate.

Madoff was taking new investor money and using it to pay old investors while completely making up the value of his investments (which were essentially all in cash) to show fictitious growth.

A pump and dump involves manipulating others to buy an actual security with the goal of being able to sell it yourself at artificially high prices. It‚Äôs too soon to tell whether GME is a pump and dump.

I don‚Äôt think restrictions from some retail brokerages had a material impact on the price, although they certainly had a material impact on the optics in that it looked very suspicious.

If one was to do a quick calculation of the number of users of WSB multiplied by 10, then one would realize that WSB could own the float of GME.

With the borrow rates being as high as they are currently, it would cause quite a bit of pain to the hedge funds to keep those positions on their books.

If one was to do the above WSB users x 10 calculation and then add 1 share to their portfolio each month, one would then realize that hedge funds would be short almost 4x the float.

I also think that Fidelity and Vanguard both have enhanced yield programs that allow long stock holders to collect 50% of the borrow rate.

The above scenarios assumes we do not have any paper portnoys in the crowd.

I know that there are lots of differences in play (like Porsche owning a huge portion of VW, etc.) but selling right now for a loss would be the worst play to make here.

If one was to do a quick calculation of the number of users of WSB multiplied by 10, then one would realize that WSB could own the float of GME.

With the borrow rates being as high as they are currently, it would cause quite a bit of pain to the hedge funds to keep those positions on their books.

If one was to do the above WSB users x 10 calculation and then add 1 share to their portfolio each month, one would then realize that hedge funds would be short almost 4x the float.

I also think that Fidelity and Vanguard both have enhanced yield programs that allow long stock holders to collect 50% of the borrow rate.

Somebody has to hold that interest rate bag, causing a decrease in quarterly performance and the lowering of bonuses.

886,GME," You want a catalyst? Here's my comment from another thread.

I have an idea that the short interest is being hidden. I have two pieces of evidence for this. The first is the runup we saw on thursday and friday, this was buying action from shorts actually covering their positions. Why would they do this? Because they needed to get the short interest under 100% for the SEC report. After Friday, and to kill momentum they rebought into their shorts Monday and tuesday. 

The second piece is that GME is still restricted, and more than that margin requirements are still 100%. I was watching a livestream yesterday where a guy couldnt place a sell order for 200 $70 GME puts because his brokerage said the security was [""hard to borrow""](https://imgur.com/gallery/7LkPBXq). 

If this theory holds any water then next week, Wednesday/thursday/friday we could start seeing another squeeze as shorts rush to cover and hide their positions from the SEC report again. This process could repeat for months, but every time GME will find a higher base since we üíéüëê and dont sell.

Edit: this also explains the s3 data shit we saw over the weekend. Short interest really had dropped, but they reshorted again monday and Tuesday.

Edit 2: you think its a fucking coincidence that the day after NYSE lifts shorting restrictions (today) on GME that the price suddenly drops 30%+?? how fucking retarded are you to believe this is legitimate sellers and not more short attacks.",Harbinger2nd,70,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lchny7/please_read_if_youre_feeling_gme_burnout_im/gm0lrlq/,0.067,0.878,0.055,-0.7254

There should be some reform here but you have the wrong idea. Naked short selling, brokers doing trade halts, obviously market manipulation on the media, they're all things that need to be investigated. But that doesn't change the overall story... 

Everyone IS making money from the stock market in general. Look at SPY over the last few years despite all the turmoil. Everyone who isn't an idiot and learned how investing works have made money.

Gamestop already has that with their pre-order offers and they may have an easier time than Epic since they already have the brand relations as well as customer fanbase.

I'd say that with all of the global attention and reinvigoration of their fans, nobody is going to want Gamestop to fail no matter how the whole GME stock situation goes.

The treasury got back more money from loan repayments and liquidation of assets than they paid out as part of TARP -- they made a very nice profit of almost 20%.  It was hardly the cost to taxpayers that it's made out to be; in fact, it was just the opposite.  They bought a lot of debt for a lot less than it ended up being worth and got a lot of equity in banks (that turned out to be quite valuable) in the process.

I won‚Äôt pull out because the corruption at the top is trying to scare me. If you have gone balls deep, by all means pull your money, but I will hold for you and others like you. If the squeeze happens, it will all be worth it, and if it doesn‚Äôt, I did the right thing at the expense of myself not others.

I‚Äôm not giving financial advice. But this is no longer a meme stock, we are playing with people‚Äôs livelihoods. You know what actually, we aren‚Äôt, the scum at the top are. If my mere 5 shares will help someone else feel at ease and secure that there are others like you, I will do my best.

I don‚Äôt like the narrative that this isn‚Äôt for the money anymore, that it‚Äôs for a message. It‚Äôs for fucking both.

Very. Suspicious. To say the least. 

next?  

We know what‚Äôs next. 

GME magically recovers as the darling of Wall Street while we got manipulated again. 

But. The story takes a turn. Billboards start appearing across the country. Melvin can‚Äôt take a drive to the local Wendy‚Äôs anymore without seeing ‚ÄúGME to the moon‚Äù. Finland buys in. Saudia Arabia buys in. Japan buys in. The mother f@cking Times Square has GME to the moon lit up for the world to see. 

This is uncharted territory here folks. I know what Wall Street wants to happen. The media is pumping it right now. They have DFV in their beady sights. They want to see us fall. Again. 
But. It‚Äôs a new world. 2008 and the VW short squeeze didn‚Äôt have Twitter. 2008 didn‚Äôt have an army of the working class sitting at their computers figuring out that Wall Street is not the God like money figure we have been told to be believe. The reality is that the Hedge Funds that ‚Äúprotect‚Äù peoples retirement are really just going off of insider knowledge and the ability to manipulate the market in mass. 

It‚Äôs not 2008 anymore. I think the world has it right and they see that WSB/DFV made a damn wise call. They are the ones trying to hold the share price up every day facing down the hedge funds with sheer determination to be validated and paid. 

What they have attempted to do is criminal. It‚Äôs not 2008. 
The world is legitimately watching and showing support in this in a way I don‚Äôt think anybody expected. Especially in 2021. 

I‚Äôm holding. I don‚Äôt want to. This isn‚Äôt an example of my normal trading-having every single trick used against you.. to the point that it‚Äôs simply pure lunacy that we are witnessing.

To actually want to question a member of WSB for market manipulation. Seriously.

Edit: had a regard moment and the actual number is at 621,483 shares. A normal amount of manipulation would be about 5000. GME has hundreds of thousands more FTD. I won't go into why this is, but here's a link if you're an intelligent ape.

1336,GME," A quick look at the chart today shows that no one is selling and the volume is far too low to account for such a large drop in price. Hold fast friends. The HFs want our shares and they're trying everything to get them. They can only take them from us if we give them.

We will not give them our shares.

No successful investor made their money by buying high and selling low. You do not sell when the price is bottoming out. You sell when the price goes up. Stocks are not options and do not expire. Eventually, given enough time and enough paper hands peeled away, the hedge funds will stop their attack and the price will go up. Everyone knows this. Mark Cuban told us as much. Elon knows this too hence the message to hold. GME has real value because the company has plans and his partnered with Microsoft. This time next year, GME could be coasting at prices higher than we've seen so far.

I know this assault is hard to bare. I know the pressure of the media, social media, even friends and family to sell and move on is coming down harder now more than ever. Don't give in. Don't let them win so easily. Just one week ago, look where GME was. Look at the chart. This level of volatility was expected. There were posts, comments, the whole shebang. 

If we continue to hold, we will definitely, most assuredly, most absolutely have a better time to sell than right now. Why would you sell at 85 or 80 or 30 or 5 when you didn't sell at 300? Or 400? It seems like a dumb question but ask yourself. Remember....buy low, sell high. Weather the storm and we will meet the tendie man when the waves and rain subside.

1344,GME," If one was to do a quick calculation of the number of users of WSB multiplied by 10, then one would realize that WSB could own the float of GME.

With the borrow rates being as high as they are currently, it would cause quite a bit of pain to the hedge funds to keep those positions on their books.

If one was to do the above WSB users x 10 calculation and then add 1 share to their portfolio each month, one would then realize that hedge funds would be short almost 4x the float.

I also think that Fidelity and Vanguard both have enhanced yield programs that allow long stock holders to collect 50% of the borrow rate.

Somebody has to hold that interest rate bag, causing a decrease in quarterly performance and the lowering of bonuses.

The above scenarios assumes we do not have any paper portnoys in the crowd.

What I am going to do is buy some GME stock. I feel it in my gut that it is going to balloon again. Maybe not to $500 but to something. I almost pulled the trigger at 90 but my gut for no explainable reasons keeps telling me $25 is the number. 

&#x200B;

My reasons which are not real reasons are that I think you guys ARE holding. You are doing teh thing with the sparkly hard rock and your shitwipers. As awesome as you are, this is still just a subreddit and most of the people who bought gme stock were not part of your subreddit but part of the cultural wave that engulfed humanity. I estimate you represent about 5% of the buyup that happened.

&#x200B;

1380,GME," Just an FYI for people (in the USA) who want to open/use an E\*TRADE account to invest with. Doing a regular money transfer from your bank account to your Securities Account can take up to 5 business days for the funds to transfer and be available for stock purchases. 

However... if you transfer the funds via a wire transfer, the money will be deposited that SAME day, and you can purchase stocks immediately. This is how I was able to transfer money from my bank's checking account last Thursday at 6am EST, and started buying GME stocks when the market opened at 9:30am EST (@ $275 per share, which hurts today, of course, but I am fucking holding with the rest of you, my fellow retards!).

Here's the link to the info on E\*TRADE account funding via Wire Transfer:

[https://us.etrade.com/what-we-offer/our-accounts/fund-my-account#tab\_2](https://us.etrade.com/what-we-offer/our-accounts/fund-my-account#tab_2)

Important fact: your bank (in my case, Wells Fargo) may allow you to create, and send to, a new wire transfer recipient via their online banking system (which it does, in my case). If so, then you can do just that (as I did), and do NOT have to fill out and submit to your bank the ""E\*TRADE Securities Wire Transfer Form"" that is mentioned in the above link.

1449,GME," As a newbie who jumped into this due to the hysteria (holding 310 GME and 200 AMC) I would like to present my point of view for the naysayers. I am 56 years old which makes me the end of the Boomers. Honestly I don't think like a boomer and I don't identify with them but I am technically one. I am however a hardcore redditor. And being so brought me to this whole hoopla.

That being said, I consider this whole Hysteria in the same way I consider the last four years and politics. I was completely uninterested in politics until the last regime and then immersed myself in education from all sites and sides to protect myself from the possible outcome of that regime which is over thank God. Now I'm a very well-read person when it comes to politics and a lot of how it works. I'm not brilliant, but I can talk with the best of them at a pretty good level. This is no different. I knew nothing about the stock market before this hoopla and yes, I dived in head first and have no regrets and I'm not sweating like a lot of people are right now. I put nothing in I couldn't afford and this has honestly been the funnest thing I've experienced since the damn coronavirus started. But because of this hysteria it opened my eyes to the stock market. Something I never even thought twice about even though I am financially comfortable. And now I'm reading everything I can get my hands on about how it works and so forth which is exactly what I did about politics. So whether I lose all my money or not is irrelevant to me, and honestly a lot of us who are first-time investors because of this. The education we are giving ourselves about the stock market out of this is priceless. So for all the Bots and honest people who are saying sell and jump ship, understand there's a multitude of reasons that some of us are still in it.

A) I can lose the money, it's not going to change my life if I do.

B) I am also sick to death of government and the rich and what they are doing to the rest of us I would very much like to Stick it to the Man.

C) Those of us who love to continuously educate ourselves no matter what our age or enjoying the hell out of learning about all of this.

D) During the pandemic when we are not allowed to fraternize with others it's super fun being part of a great group of people and movement

E) It's my business and my money and I'll do whatever the fuck I want with it

F) My 16 year-old son is already designing computer games and I might as well get a jump on the career he's going into

G) I have many children and have spent zillions of dollars at GameStop. I just like the stock.


Bought my last 10 shares during the dip and that will be all I will invest but this has been a fun week. Super sorry for everybody who is stressed as hell which means you should never have put money in this in the first place. But quit feeling sorry for any of us newbies who may lose our money.

The company restructuring along with a shift to esports and e-commerce show me a gamestop that is finally thinking ahead and one I'm willing to bet on. They are behind in the digital space but they hold many locations that are typically in city centers with access to Fibre. Internet caf√©s anyone? With cloud gaming on the rise and PC hardware out of stock or expensive this will be the next best thing for gamestop customers who get exclusive perks with their membership card (See where I'm going here?)

GME has always been about brand loyalty and consistency. They may have been consistently shit, but be God damned if you're walking out of there without a membership or an amiibo.

In the absence of good data, their efforts to manipulate sentiment are all we have from which to infer their positions. People are freaking because they think HF closed their $15 shorts and reopened at $350 or something. That may well be the case, but if they did, then they locked in a massive loss. It's like saying the price dropped from 400 to 60, so I'll just sell and re-buy and somehow I'm better off. No. They're probably also shorting to get it down to $60, meaning when it shoots back up past $500, they're going to get butt fucked *again* on every single new short they took out this week.

We're playing tug of war with our opponent, but the game is being played on a hillside, and we have the advantage of being on the lower ground. We have 2 things tilting the playing field in our advantage: #1 they pay interest on their shorts, we don't pay interest on our longs. And #2 our activity can force them to buy, but they can't legally force us to sell.

Oh and we have a shitload of reinforcements showing up in the coming days, who were unable to ever buy, who've suffered no losses, and are enthusiastic about buying the dip. Complete newcomers. Enough, I think, to turn the supply/demand balance back in our favor. And when the price starts climbing again, some shorts will shit their pants and start covering, and we'll get the mother of all spikes. I expect all of this plays out well for us even if papa Elon doesn't come through, and I've been saying all along that he very much may.

The only feasible way there could be another squeeze is if the majority of old shorts are still yet to close out their positions and have been manipulating the price of the stock down to the lowest price possible before they start covering in order to minimize the damage and put a reasonable ceiling on the price of the stock when the next squeeze occurs. If they did close out all their positions then it‚Äôs pretty safe to say that that‚Äôs what caused the 1st squeeze last week along with strong buying sentiment. In this scenario, that means that 100% of the old shorts have closed out their positions and all that‚Äôs left is the shorts who entered at or around the top last week.

1528,GME," The short % dropped 20% since the price spiked. If my theory is correct (no concrete proof it is) that was when they covered their original shorts, but replaced most of them at the higher price (minus 20% of them). i.e. it technically went from 140% to a much lower number, then immediately back up to 120% before anything was updated. Possibly, in the same transaction. Like, they cover their initial short when the price is $40, then take out a new one at $40.. then they cover that one when price hit $60, but take out another new one, etc.. rinse and repeat until the price finally levels out and starts to drop again. Maybe they didn't actually do it while the price was spiking hard, but they did eventually replace their shorts at some point.   


The problem is, none of that has to be reported. So, it's impossible for us to know exactly what each hedge's short positions are, just the overall short numbers. The fact that the short% is still so high, means its still possible to create a new squeeze. However, we need the euphoric mania to hit the mainstream audience again, or for a bunch of rich dudes to buy and hold a LOT of stock, but anyone who bought in at $200+ got burned and is probably not gonna touch GME again. So, if we did create a new squeeze, the price would be unlikely to go higher than last time, since we'd have less people jumping on board.",mrzinke,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcig9x/morale_is_100_back/gm1avdo/,0.039,0.878,0.083,0.9144

Nah, mate. It's called ''holding the bag''. And it is very much a loss if you got massively over valued shares in a dead company. Your money is fucking gone bro.


If you had shares in a strong company like Sony, Amazon, Coca Cola etc i'd definitely recommend holding. As great companies will always rise up again. But we're talking about GameStop here. A dead company that sells boxed videogames when the world has moved onto digital purchases. 


It was a meme stock, mate. WSB is known for this shit. It's just this time it blew the fuck up beyond anyone's imagination. Mob mentality had people paying $350 for a share of GameStop like it was a share of Tesla or sum shit lol.

Back then, GME often repeated the same patterns, rising in the AM and then fading off, so I often sold and rebought within the day. Started holding only when the priceaction got funky at around $40, averaged up at $100. Then sold 2k shares to deleverage in the mid 100s and then last week sold 6k shares to secure around $1.5MM. Letting the rest run, I still believe in the play. It being the shorts fucking themselves in round two or just Cohen turning it around in the next few months to years.

1589,GME," I‚Äôve been in this since early November, lowest entry was something around 11 dollars. Started with $20k in the account, CFDs, leveraged to the tits. 4k shares at first, then bought more as the price went up. Back then, GME often repeated the same patterns, rising in the AM and then fading off, so I often sold and rebought within the day. Started holding only when the priceaction got funky at around $40, averaged up at $100. Then sold 2k shares to deleverage in the mid 100s and then last week sold 6k shares to secure around $1.5MM. Letting the rest run, I still believe in the play. It being the shorts fucking themselves in round two or just Cohen turning it around in the next few months to years.

FINRA gets daily reports on short data from the brokers.

I grabbed the relevant info for GME from 1/27-2/3

If these numbers are accurate, it means that 67,092,043/124,204,925(54%) trades where short sales from 1/27-2/3

If more than 1/2 the trades are short sales its **not possible** that the short% can be lower than last week.

1596,AM, Im not arguing and Im not against it at all. Im saying this: This was started as a pump and dump scheme which means it will come to an end soon and the latecomers and thise who dont sell soon enough will lose money if not all of their money. The good thing I see happening is this: Gamestop just hired a new CTO and one who is a veteran of AWS so that said GME is attempting to rebrand itself as a virtual gamestore and virtual market and since they hired this guy from Amazon chances are likely very likely this brick and mortar shop will become a huge online trading and gaming store. That also said meaning even if you lose in the next few months money and still hold your stonk you probably will see this stonk rise greatly due to their shift in how they do business. They will likely become the Amazon of the Gaming industry. Theyd be smart to also stock up on gaming pcs and cpus and gpus to hit a mark theyve never capitalized on before which ie PC gaming. The downside to all of this is the store workers are not benefiting from any of this and while yes the piece of shit hedge funders are losing money the CEO and heads of GME have become millionaires to the umpteenth degree leaving their workers many still out of work due to covid still only worth $10 an hour. Which is very unfair. Id like to see 50% of the money they earned the CEO and Heads have earned during this civilian takeover at Gamestop and for them to take notice of their struggling employees by making a tax free donation to all of their staff from the ground up. BUT HERE IS WHERE THINGS SHOW HOW EVIL CAPITALISM IS: THE MONEY THE CEO AND EXeCS HAVE EARNED IS NOW BUYING IN STAFF TO HELP SHIFT GAMESTOP TO BECOMING A LARGE ONLINE VIRTUAL MARKETPLACE FOR GAMING LEAVING THEIR STRUGGLING EMPLOYEES STILL ONLY MAKING $10 AN HOUR AND WITH THE FUTURE OF THEIR JOBS AT STAKE BECAUSE SOMEONE DECIDED TO PUMP AND DUMP THE STOCK MAKING THE GME OWNERS TONS OF MONEY. ITS THE CYCLE OF EVIL CORPORATIONS AND CAPITALISM AND IF I AM WRONG SHOW ME. I KNOW I AM CORRECT SADLY AND NEXT YEAR WE WILL SEE HOW THEY HAVE SLOWLY LET GO OF THEIR STORES EMPLOYEES AND SOLD THEIR SHOPS TO PURCHASE WAREHOUSES IN PROBABLY A FOREIGN COUNTRY WHERE LABOR IS CHEAP. SO NO ONE REALLY STUCK IT TO THE MAN HERE BECAUSE THE MAN IS VAST AND LARGER THAN GOD HIMSELF IN CAPITALISM.

The good thing I see happening is this: Gamestop just hired a new CTO and one who is a veteran of AWS so that said GME is attempting to rebrand itself as a virtual gamestore and virtual market and since they hired this guy from Amazon chances are likely very likely this brick and mortar shop will become a huge online trading and gaming store. That also said meaning even if you lose in the next few months money and still hold your stonk you probably will see this stonk rise greatly due to their shift in how they do business. They will likely become the Amazon of the Gaming industry. Theyd be smart to also stock up on gaming pcs and cpus and gpus to hit a mark theyve never capitalized on before which ie PC gaming. The downside to all of this is the store workers are not benefiting from any of this and while yes the piece of shit hedge funders are losing money the CEO and heads of GME have become millionaires to the umpteenth degree leaving their workers many still out of work due to covid still only worth $10 an hour. Which is very unfair. Id like to see 50% of the money they earned the CEO and Heads have earned during this civilian takeover at Gamestop and for them to take notice of their struggling employees by making a tax free donation to all of their staff from the ground up. BUT HERE IS WHERE THINGS SHOW HOW EVIL CAPITALISM IS: THE MONEY THE CEO AND EXeCS HAVE EARNED IS NOW BUYING IN STAFF TO HELP SHIFT GAMESTOP TO BECOMING A LARGE ONLINE VIRTUAL MARKETPLACE FOR GAMING LEAVING THEIR STRUGGLING EMPLOYEES STILL ONLY MAKING $10 AN HOUR AND WITH THE FUTURE OF THEIR JOBS AT STAKE BECAUSE SOMEONE DECIDED TO PUMP AND DUMP THE STOCK MAKING THE GME OWNERS TONS OF MONEY. ITS THE CYCLE OF EVIL CORPORATIONS AND CAPITALISM AND IF I AM WRONG SHOW ME. I KNOW I AM CORRECT SADLY AND NEXT YEAR WE WILL SEE HOW THEY HAVE SLOWLY LET GO OF THEIR STORES EMPLOYEES AND SOLD THEIR SHOPS TO PURCHASE WAREHOUSES IN PROBABLY A FOREIGN COUNTRY WHERE LABOR IS CHEAP. SO NO ONE REALLY STUCK IT TO THE MAN HERE BECAUSE THE MAN IS VAST AND LARGER THAN GOD HIMSELF IN CAPITALISM.

1609,GME," Over the years I've realized that obsessing over the top is silly, if you always try to gun for the very top of anything you'll just end up losing money in the long run because you'll hold too long. In the moment it feels like shit to think of what if I had done x or y but the reality is that there's always the next big opportunity and it's better to go into it with lots of dry powder available than to go bust trying to extract every last penny out of one trade.

It's funny, some of my friends bought GME as well and I advised them to exit at $400 and they took it and ran while I held longer and exited at a worse price because I wasn't as conservative as my advice for others.

Edit: So some people seem to be misunderstanding my $400 exit that I recommended to my friends. This was recommended when it was already flipping around the $400 mark in pre-market hours Friday, not a random number I picked days in advance. I just felt that buying pressure would be limited by the buying restrictions so that further upside would be relatively limited to somewhere in the 400s, so exiting that day at any price over $400 would likely be on the higher end. No, I didn't tell people to just buy and then set a limit order for $400 because that would be ridiculous and nonsensical.",bittabet,82,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc0iut/saw_my_name_on_the_biggest_gme_holders_list/gly32i2/,0.111,0.77,0.119,0.4796
1610,GME," Myy logic/bullish opinion here is based purely on psychology and human behavior of degenerates. Wall Street, Hedge Funds especially, are driven by greed and ego. They're bigger degenerates than us random simple folk on WSB. This idea of cutting losses and simply covering on the GME shorts is the kind of thing some rookie investor would do. ""oh darn, these internet kids have got me, better close my positions before I lose more money."" 

Could you actually imagine anyone at a HF with that kind of attitude? No chance. They're out for blood. Their egos and penchant for gambling would default to doubling down on their shorts and then doing whatever it takes to drive the stock price down. We've heard this and read about this from former and current HF insiders too (eg Cramer interview).

Looking at the volumes while retail couldn't buy GME and the price was plummetting, I didn't get the impression of anyone actively trying to cover their short positions. In fact, they'd be stupid and weak to do so! They have retail on the ropes. What would an experienced financial predator do with their competition hogtied? Wave the white flag? Fuck no they wouldn't. Triple down on shorts and continue to drive the price down and expecting retail to exit rapidly out of fear. Sure they'd hedge with some calls/a few balanced longs. But they're looking to make more money, not cut their losses. 

I just don't think they anticipated us smooth brained folk to plant our feet and let out defiant battle cries to üíéüëê it.

1635,GME," I feel for the people who lost $ by buying at the top, it was a tough call in the heat of it and no one knew whether it was going to continue its run or tumble. At the same time, though everyone said to hold, no one was forced to do anything. For people to have made $ on GME, regardless of what price they bought at - they had to sell.  So they went against what everyone was saying to do. That is why everyone included ‚Äòthis is not financial advice‚Äô at the end of those posts. They were saying ‚Äòhold the line!‚Äô But also saying ‚Äòif this is going to effect you negatively don‚Äôt take this as advice‚Äô. Unless you bought in the last few days, there was likely a point where you would have been profitable and could have sold and took the risk anyways. If you did buy in the last few days, chances are it was only between 1-5 shares due to restrictions. 

In terms of it being a movement - it helped to expose some of the corruption we knew existed, but hadn‚Äôt necessarily seen first hand so blatantly. It was a brief moment in time where those at the top got hurt by the little guy that they consistently write off. Whether or not it will have any long term implications (I.e regulations or more transparency on naked short selling), remains to be seen. Based on what we‚Äôve seen in the past it probably won‚Äôt. It worked out well for me so I would likely think of it differently had I lost money, but I can say with confidence that if I had bought 1-2 shares at $300 and lost 60% of it, I would have no regrets. Though I know I am privileged enough that losing a few $100‚Äôs wouldn‚Äôt have a huge negative impact. If I had lost thousands that would be a different story. 

It is also worth remembering that even without the squeeze the fundamentals are strong. I have personally been buying since it dropped below 90, and now that it is below 70 even more so. Without the squeeze reasonable price targets were still $100+. Everything I bought sub $90 I am going to hold until GameStop‚Äôs transformation actually happens, which was pet of the reason I bought into it to begin with.",Poodogmillionaire,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc0iut/saw_my_name_on_the_biggest_gme_holders_list/gm0g3hr/,0.093,0.82,0.087,-0.2124

Will that amount to anything?

The real issue was the DTC raising the collateral requirement to 100% (from 2.5%-5%-ish) overnight. As well as the SEC unable (or unwilling) to go after the DTC and HF's in any substantial way. And that's from decades of precedence to how they have setup their regulations and methods of investigating Wall Street.

I have serious concerns about brokerage platforms putting in place restrictions, which limit the free trading of stocks and options, especially when those restrictions disproportionately benefit large hedge fund operators at the expense of individual investors.",Absolutboss,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcew5b/our_state_reps_actually_do_have_our_interests_at/gm02tzo/,0.034,0.825,0.141,0.9571

Make sure you leave your name, phone, email, or otherwise they will have no way of responding to you. Ask for a response if you want one or you‚Äôre unlikely to get one. If you‚Äôre vulgar or the message is entirely lazy I wouldn‚Äôt expect one either. 

You can also call and politely ask the secretary to see if your constituent letter was filed if you‚Äôve received nothing after a week. 

EDIT: B/C of Covid emailing is your best bet but again ask for a response and provide the details they need to address you. From my experience we didn‚Äôt respond to John/Jane Doe‚Äôs.

> Now what I'm going to say now will probably prove very unpopular on this forum, and it is being said not to offend anyone but simply to state the fact. GME's current stock price is divorced from reality and will ultimately collapse down, perhaps substantially so from current levels. Now I'm not saying anyone should short this stock - that's a fool's errand. Nor should options like long short-term puts be used to bet this will occur. Option implied volatility for this issue would make it more likely you will loss money on any such bet. This is because the squeeze here is largely over. Massive forced buying of GME has occurred from many funds, that were backed up against margin requirements and needed to preserve liquidity and cover. The overall loss in both the S&P and DJIA yesterday only exacerbated the need for many funds to cover their short positions. Run-ups in many heavily short issues (like GWPH) occurred yesterday as long-short hedge funds were forced to both sell their longs and simultaneously cover their shorts in an attempt to avoid the fate of Melvin capital and the bleak alternatives of either bankruptcy or begging for garage sale dilutive capital infusions in order to avoid a total loss.
This sequence of forced buying has largely already played out, both for GME and for many other similar companies like BB. Now I have no idea where GME will be today, tomorrow or even a month from now - but ultimately it will fall from today's artificially elevated values. It is impossible to know when this collapse will occur, but this is essentially a certainty. The point I'm making here is simple: If you have profits in this company, or others that have recently participated in the near marketwise epic short squeeze, you should take them and probably do so quickly. This is your change to profit from the many long-short hedge funds who have been given a real beat-down from this epic retain investor phenom. Once the collapse in valuations occurs here, it is very unlikely a repeat of the recent action will occur - at least for the recently squeezed companies. So get out, take your profits and, at least for now, park the profits in a profitable company with a reasonable valuation and future growth prospects - like APPL which, for full disclosure, we have a very large long position in. I am very confident you will get higher future returns with that strategy versus the alternative of holding GME for the long term.

If one was to do a quick calculation of the number of users of WSB multiplied by 10, then one would realize that WSB could own the float of GME.

With the borrow rates being as high as they are currently, it would cause quite a bit of pain to the hedge funds to keep those positions on their books.

If one was to do the above WSB users x 10 calculation and then add 1 share to their portfolio each month, one would then realize that hedge funds would be short almost 4x the float.

I also think that Fidelity and Vanguard both have enhanced yield programs that allow long stock holders to collect 50% of the borrow rate.

Somebody has to hold that interest rate bag, causing a decrease in quarterly performance and the lowering of bonuses.

Media Hype, the Motivation here and random Factors such as Elon tweeting about GME took the price up into the high 200$ range. 10-30% of shorts exiting rocketed it up to 400-500$. This is where they opened new shorts (Short interest basically same as before if not higher)

We just have to wait until 9.2. to confirm my theory. Please set a remindme.

1931,OR," Good point that makes sense but theoretically if there was more shorts then possible shares to be bought you would think they could just hold and literally charge whatever they want. If it was true and even we saw that they could also see it. This to me says that the top MM's definitely communicate to some extent, meaning they wouldn't completely destroy one another OR if one of them got destroyed it would be just as bad for the rest.

If MM (a) is short 140% and MM (b) has the capital to buy enough shares to literally make it impossible for (a) to cover. Why wouldn't (b) do it? That's what I can't figure out

That is the entire theory of this whole thing. ""If we hold the shorts are forced to buy at our price"" if that is true why doesn't some multi billionare not just buy the rest of the remaining float and run it to whatever price they want. It would be free money if the short theory is true",happyidiot09,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc15bw/wsb_control_room/gly6skg/,0.063,0.765,0.172,0.9628
1932,GME," Since shares can be reshorted multiple times, you could theoretically close all short positions with 1 share that's moved around. In GME's case, all the short positions only needed a small portion of GME's float to be retraded around to close short positions, so if a single larger player sold a portion of their holdings, the others were screwed. This brings us back to our prisoner's dilemma.


Market makers don't typically hold any long term or large positions in stocks, especially one as volatile as GME. Also, they don't care about each other. Each one focuses on performing as well as possible. If a competitor is stupid and goes out of business, it's a good opportunity for everyone else to hire the competitor's best people and make sure they don't make the same mistakes.

I've worked at one of the top market makers and have friends at most of the others, and they're not nefarious places where people try to manipulate markets behind the scenes. It's a bunch of math and computer science nerds trying to model the market and improve their firm's software systems.


Do these people look like a cabal of insiders working to manipulate the market?

Edit: To address you point about why one person can't just buy up the entire float: it's usually not possible or advisable. Buying up the entirety of the float isn't an instantaneous operation. Not every available share will be on the market. As a result, buying up all the float is a prohibitively expensive thing or sometimes impossible thing. The VW short squeeze was caused by porsche trying to do just that and they weren't even able to buy all of VW since the german government had 25% that they didn't want to sell. Also, of the few billionaires that could afford to do such a thing, most of their wealth is locked away in their company's stocks. Even if they had the available capital, it's still a very risky investment that would risk a significant portion of their wealth.",tomjerry777,15,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc15bw/wsb_control_room/gly8l2r/,0.051,0.84,0.109,0.9642

1973,GME," > This is a market glitch, so r/WSB predicted that it would be limited to reasonable Ask prices somehow.

Except it's really not.  10k/share is more than reasonable imo.  Pre-this-event they were easily 180/share, after this event they got so much positive marketing for free they could get to 400/share doing basically anything.  However, their recent hires suggest they're doing a LOT MORE than ""basically anything,"" they hired the guy who built Amazon's eCommerce platform, they hired the guy who built Walmart's eCommerce logistics infrastructure, and they hired the guy who built Chewy's customer service support infrastructure (which, for reference, is similarly the best out there.)  These hires suggest to me that they're going all-in on general online retail sales, only unlike Amazon the conservatives don't hate them, and unlike Walmart the liberals don't hate them, everyone loves them.  When you compare the market cap vs percentage of online sales then adjust market cap to market cap from Amazon to GME or from Walmart to GME you get about $24,253/share or $1,417/share respectively, if they only hit half of that combined total a fair valuation would be $12,835/share.  Will that be overnight?  Of course not.  But I really don't mind holding this for 4-10 years or just saving it for retirement.

I don't see how firm a and firm b can constantly hit each other's orders when that is the case, unless they are trading on a dark pool but I dont see how that really affects prices in the way described.

Second this is the most blatant and traceable form of market manipulation if it works as described. The ONLY description of a short ladder I can even find on google that predates GME is an absolute nutjob blog post.

2039,IQ," I've heard two methods (I'm an ape but this is my 40 IQ understanding of the matter):  
1) You create a synthetic long with a 200 IQ trade and sell the long. I believe it's something along the lines of creating a put and call option at the same time, exercising the call (at a slightly lower than market price) and then sell the shares even lower for a slight loss. Something along those lines that effectively creates a temporary and legal stock out there called a synthetic long  


2) Bidding/Asking stocks back and forth between HF's shell companies for slightly lower and lower amounts, driving price down. I've heard this actually works better when there's actually a larger trading volume because it's easier to do this undetected and trading is less likely to get halted  


And with both methods you're basically throwing away money (10's of millions of dollars) to drive the price down, which means it's only worth doing if you have a very LARGE amount of money invested in a single stock",arenalr,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcew2h/reddit_did_not_invent_short_ladder_attacks/glzuqjw/,0.066,0.795,0.14,0.9326

>A third market consists of trading conducted by non-exchange¬†member broker-dealers and [institutional investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalinvestor.asp) of exchange-listed stocks. In other words, the third market involves exchange-listed securities that are being traded over-the-counter between broker-dealers and [large institutional investors](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/institutional-investors/).  
>  
>The term ""[over-the-counter](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp)"" typically refers to the trading of securities that are not listed on widely-recognized exchanges such as the¬†[New York Stock Exchange](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp)¬†(NYSE). These securities are instead traded through a [broker-dealer network](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker-dealer.asp), as the securities don't meet the listing requirements of a centralized exchange. In the case of the third market, the securities are exchange-listed, but they are not being traded through the exchange.

2054,GME," If one was to do a quick calculation of the number of users of WSB multiplied by 10, then one would realize that WSB could own the float of GME.

With the borrow rates being as high as they are currently, it would cause quite a bit of pain to the hedge funds to keep those positions on their books.

If one was to do the above WSB users x 10 calculation and then add 1 share to their portfolio each month, one would then realize that hedge funds would be short almost 4x the float.

I also think that Fidelity and Vanguard both have enhanced yield programs that allow long stock holders to collect 50% of the borrow rate.

Somebody has to hold that interest rate bag, causing a decrease in quarterly performance and the lowering of bonuses.

The new  shareholders were registered on the spot, but Lampe did not register the  monies brought in with the selling party. **As a result, the selling  parties could continue to assert their right to the payment of any  dividends and the purchasing parties could not.

>These people are now saying it'll take months, which is just moving the goalposts.

I am more amazed that people thought is was going to be fast. There was the meteoric rise last week which was at least some form of squeeze. Depending on shorts and interest there will be another squeeze some time later or it's all done. There is no way to be certain at this point.

2086,BB," You‚Äôre correct that this example doesn‚Äôt describe a fund selling large amounts of shares at a low ask *and buying them back*, as a matter of fact I have had a very hard time finding any information on that. However, I don‚Äôt understand why this couldn‚Äôt be performed between two different hedge funds multiple times over to lower the price as much as they would like/can afford. Obviously their intent is to scare other investors into selling with them, and in the Investopedia article it does specify, ‚ÄúInvestors get the impression that there is something wrong with the company, so they sell, pushing the price EVEN lower‚Äù. Emphasis on the word ‚Äúeven‚Äù, implying that the price would have been lowered already from the initial sell-off.

My arguments for why this strategy should NOT be successful are: 

1. Any investor attempting to lower the price by making a huge sell-off is going to be taking a loss. 

2. Buying pressure will force the price to where it belongs, regardless of a sell-off with the intention of lowering the price.

3. You can‚Äôt pick who you want to sell your stock to.

The two that concern me the most are numbers 2 and 3.

Counterpoints:

1. Hedge funds that are short GME are already losing money while the price is increasing. Depending on the size of the loss from a sell-off and how much the price has dropped, it‚Äôs feasible for there to be a point in which it is more profitable to take a small loss immediately to prevent larger losses later.

2. Buying pressure absolutely crushes this strategy, if there is a large demand for a security then the price will increase once the sell-off is finished (potentially to a lower price than it was before). Unfortunately, the demand aspect was obliterated when brokers began limiting purchases. The buying pressure that was causing the price to rapidly increase was suddenly choked off, causing the price to decrease. At this point, large sell-offs have a much higher effect on the price.

3. You can‚Äôt choose who to trade with, the market was designed to give traders the best available price. A seller will receive the highest available bid, a buyer will receive the lowest available ask. When brokers eliminated the ability for a large number of people to buy, the highest available bid was determined by the only remaining traders. The pool of traders is now much smaller, so when a large sell-off happens not only does the price decrease (Counterpoint 1), but there is also less buying pressure to bounce the price back upwards (Counterpoint 2). It is at this point that it would be most beneficial to work with another party. Party A initiates sell-off and hopes other investors join, Party B buys the dip, and then proceeds to initiate another sell-off (again, in hopes even more people will join). This process could be repeated as many times as desired with the only limitations being the cost of the attacks and the current buying pressure.

I want to be crystal clear, I own 1.5 shares of GME @ $150 and .5 shares of BB @ $20. I believe we‚Äôve already had the squeeze and that it ended the second brokerages decided to limit buying. I‚Äôm holding these shares only because I plan on buying more once the price drops to where it was pre-squeeze. I have faith in RC and plan on holding this for quite a while.

I also want to thank you, it‚Äôs been hard to find genuine conversations and debates lately. My smooth-brain feels extra wrinkly now. Please correct or contradict anything I‚Äôve just stated.

This is another good DD post that hasnt been seen enough:

**TLDR**: ""If a shift to digital first does occur, and GME becomes a subscription first omnichannel gaming company, the market cap will conservatively be 10x topline revenues.

Let's say that stays flat next year at $5B.

This market cap (matching industry standards) **should for an appropriate valuation for a growth stock be $50B.**

I know this sounds insane. But if Ryan can complete the transformation he is hoping for this is a very conservative valuation.

A $50B market cap would be $800 a share right now. Again, this assumes Zero topline revenue growth. If revenue begins to grow again 10x will be unrealistic and the multiples will get far higher.

I really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as simple as ‚Äúwe just hold and eventually the shorts will have to pay us‚Äù but I‚Äôm increasingly leaning towards the fact that they just won‚Äôt. There will be some kind of ‚Äútoo big to fail‚Äù mechanism put in place that will inevitably fuck all of us. We‚Äôll cry foul (and rightly so) but at the end of the day we‚Äôre probably going to get the shaft. These companies know the outrage will eventually blow over, and as we‚Äôve mentioned many times a fine is well worth saving what these people would lose if they let us win.

I‚Äôm down bigly on GME but it‚Äôs nothing I couldn‚Äôt lose. Financially I‚Äôll be alright but morally and mentally this entire thing has tapped me. How do you win when the other side writes the rules as they go?

Why the media coverage? Because that's what the fucking news does you peanut brained fucks. You don't need an astrophysics degree to see that something that rocketed to 1000% it's original value and crashing back down to earth isn't news worthy.

2169,GME," If one was to do a quick calculation of the number of users of WSB multiplied by 10, then one would realize that WSB could own the float of GME.

With the borrow rates being as high as they are currently, it would cause quite a bit of pain to the hedge funds to keep those positions on their books.

If one was to do the above WSB users x 10 calculation and then add 1 share to their portfolio each month, one would then realize that hedge funds would be short almost 4x the float.

I also think that Fidelity and Vanguard both have enhanced yield programs that allow long stock holders to collect 50% of the borrow rate.

Somebody has to hold that interest rate bag, causing a decrease in quarterly performance and the lowering of bonuses.

The above scenarios assumes we do not have any paper portnoys in the crowd.

I personally think that the jump in share price was just the hype train of getting in on the squeeze. LOTS of people were buying the stock last week as it was going up (myself included).

They literally would have had to buy 100% PLUS the extra 20 something percent on top?

The thirteen days don't mean that all of a sudden everyone has to buy their shares back. It is more of a trailing rescue of failures to deliver. Any stocks that fail to deliver must be bought after thirteen days even if it means that the brokerage that wasn't delivered to buys them again and charges the 1st guy for the shares.

IE: Brokerage A buys shares from Seller B - this is T(ransaction) Day. Seller B doesn't have the shares (naked short) and fails to deliver after the two days that are allotted (on day 3, so T+3). At this point Brokerage A reports to the SEC of the failure to deliver. Too many of these failures-to-deliver land the stock on the SHO list, but it is more of a notification than a countdown.

After ten more days T+13 the brokerage is required to make good the sale, even if it has to charge the first brokerage.

2249,IMO," I agree, the context for the original short squeeze has changed and I‚Äôm sure hedgies have already adapted to it, so if it happens it‚Äôs because they are allowing to.

The new direction of GameStop as a company has a lot of potential, and they are bringing people who know what and how to do it. IMO the best way to make the stock increase in value now is to make the company valuable (and this increase in value is permanent)

If instead of buying games for cheaper at Amazon we prioritize GameStop, (including their other plans once they are implemented) they‚Äôll have great numbers that will ensure they hit their goals and improve the company‚Äôs image in the market.

If you trust the new vision and team, say it so by making their roadmap a reality.

With the borrow rates being as high as they are currently, it would cause quite a bit of pain to the hedge funds to keep those positions on their books.

If one was to do the above WSB users x 10 calculation and then add 1 share to their portfolio each month, one would then realize that hedge funds would be short almost 4x the float.

I also think that Fidelity and Vanguard both have enhanced yield programs that allow long stock holders to collect 50% of the borrow rate.

2313,SI," What?

That's not how short selling works unless I'm missing something.

They took the short positions at $400 and $300 to keep the pressure on and push the stock price down. You don't take a short position because you anticipate a squeeze‚Äîis that what you're trying to say?

$400 short position is juicy for any HF willing to bet this goes down from there. And obviously it has. They could close their position right now and make bank.

If the SI is still high, and no one knows the real numbers it seems, then obviously it means they haven't closed and are on the hook for the squeeze still, but there's not enough momentum.

People need to understand that they're holding because of the belief that HFs are still on the hook for a large premium. You're hoping a significant short position exists sub $90/80. The HFs holding short positions at $300 and $400 are not sweating right now, as far as I understand it.

2399,TV," Per WeBull CEO interview from last Thursday, the requirement was 1% to 3% collateral for 2 days until final settlement.

It's been changed for GME to 100%. If a single $320 share changes hands 10 times in a day, that's an extra 3.2kilobuck that must be held as collateral until the T+2 settlement. Which means smaller companies must get huge bridge loans to continue buys.

2408,PT," Scale in please. Do not buy all at one point. 

In this way you can average down your cost, if it goes down. If it goes up, then you are buying in the direction of momentum. 

This also means that if it swings wildly against you, you risked very little and can get out.

This isn‚Äôt investment advice, but rather a recommendation for new traders and a different approach to accomplish the same thing. It can be applied to pretty much every trade

Edit: Also applies to taking profits.

You will never nail the peak unless you are luck as fuck. Take profits via scaling out. Hit your PT to cover initial cost? Take some profits.

Example:

You own 100 shares of a $5 stock. ($500). Stock flies to $10/share. Sell half to cover initial cost. This ensures that no matter what you cannot lose money. Now you are playing with ‚Äúhouse money.‚Äù It goes to $15 a share, which is what you thought it would go to? Take profits of another 25 shares. Now you made $375 with zero risk to principal. No matter what you locked in a 75% gain. You let the other 25 shares ride, and sell whenever you feel like it. 

This is how experienced traders play the game. The objective isn‚Äôt just to make money, but it‚Äôs also to protect initial capital.

2413,GME," I gotcha. When you buy options you pay a premium. Some people (theta gang) make their money by being on the other side of the trade where they sell the options. They get that premium for doing so.

 For example,  I could post collateral of $9000 and sell a 2/12 put for $2500 in premium (that's fucking insane btw). If gme closes below $90 a share by market close, the option is exercised and I am forced to buy 100 shares of GME at 90, but keep the 2.5k. If not, the option expires worthless and I keep the 2.5k.

Biggest downside to this is if GME plummets to like 30 a share, I still have to buy 100 shares at 90 which gives me a net loss of $3,500 dollars. Make sense?",Quinnteligent,40,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc5oc9/seems_like_a_no_brainer_to_me_200000_order/glynpst/,0.098,0.814,0.088,-0.1145

2463,GME," Hello, newfriend.

Hindenburg Research is a pretty well-known short seller. These firms publish short reports for free (most quality research costs money) and almost always have a short position in the stock. Short reports aren't all bad like WSB wants to think - sometimes they expose straight fraud or criminal activity and the company will be destroyed because of it. There was a great example last year published by Hindenburg: https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/ Nikola was/is an absolute fraud and Trevor Milton should be in jail. I'm amazed they still even exist.

Short selling is a good thing to have in markets because it rewards spotting frauds and outing garbage companies. The benefits of short sellers far outweigh the occasional abuse like GME. Sharp investors like DFV will find stocks like GME before everyone else and know the shorts don't have an argument. Them being short is their problem, not his.

With the comment about ""environment"", they're referring to the fact that tons of retail traders have been mobbing short-sellers and high short-interest stocks for fun, so it makes it dangerous to be short right now.",reddit_schmeddit,412,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbzeuv/i_dont_post_here_often_but_my_curiosity_has/glwz98s/,0.168,0.687,0.145,-0.6098

If one was to do a quick calculation of the number of users of WSB multiplied by 10, then one would realize that WSB could own the float of GME.

With the borrow rates being as high as they are currently, it would cause quite a bit of pain to the hedge funds to keep those positions on their books.

If one was to do the above WSB users x 10 calculation and then add 1 share to their portfolio each month, one would then realize that hedge funds would be short almost 4x the float.

If one was to do a quick calculation of the number of users of WSB multiplied by 10, then one would realize that WSB could own the float of GME.

With the borrow rates being as high as they are currently, it would cause quite a bit of pain to the hedge funds to keep those positions on their books.

If one was to do the above WSB users x 10 calculation and then add 1 share to their portfolio each month, one would then realize that hedge funds would be short almost 4x the float.

I also think that Fidelity and Vanguard both have enhanced yield programs that allow long stock holders to collect 50% of the borrow rate.

2860,GME," Thank you for a perfect example of copium. Here's a comment I'm copy pasting a comment I wrote yesterday about this dumbass number you all are parroting that is **3-week old data that pre-dates the squeeze you missed**, because for some reason yesterday everyone keeps quoting 226.42%:

The numbers you are quoting are from Jan 15th. Yet for some reason of all days, **today** is the day people are quoting this old 226% number - likely because some dumbass only today found the FINRA website and stupidly thought the price reflected today:

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME

>Shares Short (Jan 15, 2021) 4	61.78M

> Short Ratio (Jan 15, 2021) 4	2.81

> Short % of Float (Jan 15, 2021) 4	226.42%

> Short % of Shares Outstanding (Jan 15, 2021) 4	88.58%

> Shares Short (prior month Dec 15, 2020) 4	68.13M


^4: Data provided by Morningstar, Inc.

Hey look, those are the EXACT same numbers all being cited by people on Stockwits today:

>STOCK: GME

> DAYS TO COVER: 2.81

> % SHARES SHORT 88.58%

> Company: GameStop Corp

> Last Price: $325.00

> Short Interest: 61.78M

> % Float: 226.42%

There have even been OTHER reddit posts **last week** (when it was already outdated) quoting that same outdated 226.42% **exactly**:

2864,GME," I know that ""you can't use past performance to predict future trends"" in the stock market, but I'm still astounded at how many people are jumping ship already given that the VW 2008 squeeze included an entire week of plummeting stock prices before the squeeze started.  The squeeze was a 3 week event where the 2nd week was red candles before the 3rd week of mooning.  I know that there are lots of differences in play (like Porsche owning a huge portion of VW, etc.) but selling right now for a loss would be the worst play to make here.  We get new information about Short Interest next week and there is still so much negative press trying to suppress interest in GME that I feel it's worth sticking around.

2867,DD," Down vote me if you want, but this sounds too convenient. I get that the math is behind this reasoning, but it's getting hard to believe the hedgies are risking their necks with their boomer tactics, against unconventional foes like us. The words that went around were quite clear, and some people are even treating this as a some kind of a phenomenon. I guess, in some way, it is. But the hedgies aren't retarded.

Look, in another universe, maybe everyone's diamond hands. But it's logic that when the loss is too great and fear kicks in, people will sell. And this line that we are holding will slowly chip away. The hedgies are counting on this, and this is also backed by math. Hell, it's nature.

Just look around WSB. Bunch of echo chambers, confirmation bias, and people have become more cautious. You hardly see any DD as much as before, less so than people telling others to spend only money they can afford to lose.

I went pretty far. But for me, the pressure is too great. I have to meet ends meet. But I won't sell, because it would be a major loss and I can't accept this. When they said this will end in tears, I'm starting to believe they may be right.

Just consider all options. Try to look at things from their side  - ie, why would they keep spreading all this FUD? instead of thinking the ONLY explanation is the ""squeeze is still on!"" and ""apes HOLD"" just evaluate for a minute why else could they be spreading that info?

Maybe it IS for FUD but there might be other reasons.

2879,GME,"  

If one was to do a quick calculation of the number of users of WSB multiplied by 10, then one would realize that WSB could own the float of GME.

With the borrow rates being as high as they are currently, it would cause quite a bit of pain to the hedge funds to keep those positions on their books.

If one was to do the above WSB users x 10 calculation and then add 1 share to their portfolio each month, one would then realize that hedge funds would be short almost 4x the float.

I also think that Fidelity and Vanguard both have enhanced yield programs that allow long stock holders to collect 50% of the borrow rate.

Somebody has to hold that interest rate bag, causing a decrease in quarterly performance and the lowering of bonuses.

The above scenarios assumes we do not have any paper portnoys in the crowd.

mindful of others and respectful in my word choices. And although I would welcome a change in the culture, specifically the usage of derogatory words, here I‚Äôm not holding my breath.

Instead I try to limit my use of such words to here or when talking in reference to this subreddit, while always using it in a positive or favorable way to describe someone.
Basically when possible I try to ‚Äòflip it‚Äô.
And I think that many, although obviously not everyone, here is doing something similar.

If one was to do a quick calculation of the number of users of WSB multiplied by 10, then one would realize that WSB could own the float of GME.

With the borrow rates being as high as they are currently, it would cause quite a bit of pain to the hedge funds to keep those positions on their books.

If one was to do the above WSB users x 10 calculation and then add 1 share to their portfolio each month, one would then realize that hedge funds would be short almost 4x the float.

I also think that Fidelity and Vanguard both have enhanced yield programs that allow long stock holders to collect 50% of the borrow rate.

Somebody has to hold that interest rate bag, causing a decrease in quarterly performance and the lowering of bonuses.

2947,GME," If one was to do a quick calculation of the number of users of WSB multiplied by 10, then one would realize that WSB could own the float of GME.

With the borrow rates being as high as they are currently, it would cause quite a bit of pain to the hedge funds to keep those positions on their books.

If one was to do the above WSB users x 10 calculation and then add 1 share to their portfolio each month, one would then realize that hedge funds would be short almost 4x the float.

I also think that Fidelity and Vanguard both have enhanced yield programs that allow long stock holders to collect 50% of the borrow rate.

Somebody has to hold that interest rate bag, causing a decrease in quarterly performance and the lowering of bonuses.

3031,GME," I have an idea that the short interest is being hidden. I have two pieces of evidence for this. The first is the runup we saw on thursday and friday, this was buying action from shorts actually covering their positions. Why would they do this? Because they needed to get the short interest under 100% for the SEC report. After Friday, and to kill momentum they rebought into their shorts Monday and tuesday. 

The second piece is that GME is still restricted, and more than that margin requirements are still 100%. I was watching a livestream yesterday where a guy couldnt place a sell order for 200 $70 GME puts because his brokerage said the security was [""hard to borrow""](https://imgur.com/gallery/7LkPBXq). 

If this theory holds any water then next week, Wednesday/thursday/friday we could start seeing another squeeze as shorts rush to cover and hide their positions from the SEC report again. This process could repeat for months, but every time GME will find a higher base since we üíéüëê and dont sell.

Edit: this also explains the s3 data shit we saw over the weekend. Short interest really had dropped, but they reshorted again monday and Tuesday.

3035,SI," Is it possible to know if all the old shorts closed out their positions during the price hike last week? The only feasible way there could be another squeeze is if the majority of old shorts are still yet to close out their positions and have been manipulating the price of the stock down to the lowest price possible before they start covering in order to minimize the damage and put a reasonable ceiling on the price of the stock when the next squeeze occurs. If they did close out all their positions then it‚Äôs pretty safe to say that that‚Äôs what caused the 1st squeeze last week along with strong buying sentiment. In this scenario, this means that 100% of the old shorts have covered their positions and all that‚Äôs left is the shorts who entered at or around the top last week. So from my understanding, the coming SI report doesn‚Äôt really matter (even if it shows massive short interest) unless it can tell us the position a which each short entered. Correct? If the report comes out and says >100% short interest, how does that help us in any way? Even if SI is still massive, what if the vast majority are new shorts who got in at peak prices last week? The report won‚Äôt tell us that. If this is the case, how could they possibly be squeezed unless buyer sentiment turns bullish again and drives the stock back up to $500+ levels and beyond which seems unlikely. 

Which scenario do you believe to be more likely? Open to criticism, trying to further my understanding of the situation at hand.",HotspurN17,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lci621/hold_until_february_9th_at_least/gm17aiq/,0.038,0.885,0.076,0.8821

If one was to do a quick calculation of the number of users of WSB multiplied by 10, then one would realize that WSB could own the float of GME.

With the borrow rates being as high as they are currently, it would cause quite a bit of pain to the hedge funds to keep those positions on their books.

If one was to do the above WSB users x 10 calculation and then add 1 share to their portfolio each month, one would then realize that hedge funds would be short almost 4x the float.

I also think that Fidelity and Vanguard both have enhanced yield programs that allow long stock holders to collect 50% of the borrow rate.

Somebody has to hold that interest rate bag, causing a decrease in quarterly performance and the lowering of bonuses.

The above scenarios assumes we do not have any paper portnoys in the crowd.

If one was to do a quick calculation of the number of users of WSB multiplied by 10, then one would realize that WSB could own the float of GME.

With the borrow rates being as high as they are currently, it would cause quite a bit of pain to the hedge funds to keep those positions on their books.

If one was to do the above WSB users x 10 calculation and then add 1 share to their portfolio each month, one would then realize that hedge funds would be short almost 4x the float.

I also think that Fidelity and Vanguard both have enhanced yield programs that allow long stock holders to collect 50% of the borrow rate.

If one was to do a quick calculation of the number of users of WSB multiplied by 10, then one would realize that WSB could own the float of GME.

With the borrow rates being as high as they are currently, it would cause quite a bit of pain to the hedge funds to keep those positions on their books.

If one was to do the above WSB users x 10 calculation and then add 1 share to their portfolio each month, one would then realize that hedge funds would be short almost 4x the float.

I also think that Fidelity and Vanguard both have enhanced yield programs that allow long stock holders to collect 50% of the borrow rate.

Somebody has to hold that interest rate bag, causing a decrease in quarterly performance and the lowering of bonuses.

The big difference is that VW, as an auto company, was inherently more valuable in its time than Gamestop currently is as a specialty games company. If it were instead, say, a tech company that was being shorted to oblivion I could see the argument.

I think a lot of people fell to FOMO when the idea of ""I could be a millionaire"" entered their minds. I know I did - my whole portfolio was up 1000% because Gamestop alone nearly overnight.

GME started at ~$20/share and peaked at $483/share, that‚Äôs  a 24x increase.  The peak we just had (squeeze or not) is 4.8x more than the VW squeeze.

EDIT Checking math:

I mentally did 1000/200 and got 50x.  Should have been 5x.  Which makes the drastic size difference (2.4x) between the two even more drastic (24x).

3389,GME," The GameStop squeeze is a unique scenario, however, because it is a very public fight to the finish between the Reddit army and the hedge funds that are short. Either the Reddit army wins and the hedge funds pay four-digit prices ($1,000 or more) to cover their shorts because of margin calls, or the hedge funds win and the GME share price falls back to the low double-digits.

In a battle like that, with public coverage influencing both sides, perception is a weapon. As such, if the hedge funds can generate the appearance of having covered most of their shorts, while driving down the GME share price through aggressive selling on low volume (something known as a ‚Äúshort ladder attack‚Äù), then the hedge funds increase their odds of breaking the squeeze ‚Äî in part because media outlets will report things like ‚ÄúGameStop Short Interest Plunges‚Äù without looking deeper.",Quick_Ad775Random,27,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcoe7l/gme_afternoon_tea_megathread_feb_4_2021/gm152c4/,0.091,0.774,0.135,0.8527

we played their game, convinced that Trading was democratized, that we are all playing under the same rules.

we had the Hedge funds beat. the writing was on the wall. The mother of all short squeezes was underway on Thursday January 28, 2021. 

We had already won. and they knew this. People would do anything for money, especially when it is that much. So what did they do? They fucking robbed us by literally removing the ""buy"" button and only leaving the option to ""sell"" in a coordinated move between the most heavily trafficked brokers at the same time. Think of the panic selling that occurred for that reason alone. The price fell from well above 400 to below 100 in MINUTES.

Just having that ""buy"" button removed caused investors to panic and sell, knowing that no one else could buy back stock FOR WHO KNOWS HOW LONG. and none of us knew how long we were going to be left without the option to buy at the time. 

This is all incredible bullshit.

3445,RH," Just woke up.

Here's my plan:

Write off my entire RH account as a loss (GME + various other stocks, and yes, I'm going to transfer out of RH and into TDA).

Set up price alerts in case any of these stonks come around and breakeven so I can sell. Maybe I'll get lucky and get some money back.

Make a new budget with You Need a Budget.

Probably stop fucking with stonks from here on out. Or at least set a reasonable limit, like $100 a month to DCA into something I really like (could even be GME- I still like the stock and I like the company, sincerely).

I'm lucky enough to be able to lose this much money and be able to respond to it by shoring up my budget instead of tearing out my hair and selling all my worldly possessions. I do feel bad for people who got in on the hype at $300 or $400. I've read some stories of people using student loans or even their house payments. I don't blame them though- because of this fucking pandemic a lot of people are already so behind on rent and unable to make an income that they figured it was worth taking a YOLO shot at a better life now and getting evicted, then using up all their grace period for back rent and getting evicted in a month.

3628,GME,"  

If one was to do a quick calculation of the number of users of WSB multiplied by 10, then one would realize that WSB could own the float of GME.

With the borrow rates being as high as they are currently, it would cause quite a bit of pain to the hedge funds to keep those positions on their books.

If one was to do the above WSB users x 10 calculation and then add 1 share to their portfolio each month, one would then realize that hedge funds would be short almost 4x the float.

I also think that Fidelity and Vanguard both have enhanced yield programs that allow long stock holders to collect 50% of the borrow rate.

Somebody has to hold that interest rate bag, causing a decrease in quarterly performance and the lowering of bonuses.

And it's clear that almost anytime you do comment, you just spit off rude, condescending vitriol. The 'King' of trolls, if you will. 

But the fact still remains, you don't understand this play at all. What happened to Volkswagen when they went through this? It was at the baseline price, shot up to $400/share, then crashed down all the way to where it started........then shot up to $1200 right after. You would have been right there laughing at everyone still holding after it shot back down to where it started. But you would have been dead wrong.

In this case, we're dealing with billions of dollars short. Regardless of how the shorts escape and for how cheaply, they must buy the shares and return them. Does that point elude you? You do realize that this price is temporary, don't you? That GME has an ever increasing fan base, both small retail investors and institutional investors alike, and that Cohen and company are going to be rolling out announcement after announcement and the price is going to continue to rise. 

Your only argument is what? That you don't believe Cohen can turn it around because you're so smart? What do you see that he doesn't? What makes you so right and he and his colleagues so wrong.

Ryan Cohen continues to make good decisions, AWS people brought in, E-commerce people brough in, customer relations from Chewy brought in. He has a long-term plan, and thats what I‚Äôm betting on.

Ain‚Äôt gonna lie, had RH not killed the momentum the day of the big spike, I would have sold probably 1/3rd of my stock at $500-600+ with limit sell kicking in, and l would have bought more after the price equalized. My end goal was never a squeeze and dump, I actually have faith in the company and Ryan turning it around.
