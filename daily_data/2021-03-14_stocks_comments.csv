1,CSR," Finally, something I can help with.

OP, I work for a Stock Transfer Agent, not the agent for Meredith, but I can steer you in the right direction.

First, you can't assume that the stock certificate is worth anything at this point. You MUST contact the Stock Transfer Agent for Meredith. That is Equiniti:  800-468-9716. Any time a physical stock certificate is issued it is no longer listed on the records of a broker and instead is listed on the Transfer Agents records. So there is no need to contact a broker first.

You will need some info before calling Equiniti. First, see if you have any old statements kept with the certificate. These will list the account number at Equiniti. Also, whoever is the first name on the certificate, you will need their social security number as well. 

You will need to explain to the Customer Service Rep (CSR) that your Grandparents are deceased and you found a stock certificate among the possessions that they left for you in their will. The CSR will ask you if you know your Grandparent's account number (from a statement) and if not, the social security number of the first name listed on the stock. Thankfully you've already done that legwork. Next they will ask you to pass a verification check. This will include tell them exactly how the account is registered (the names on the stock certificate), the mailing address (most likely the last address your Grandparents lived at) and the last 4 digits of the shareholder's social security number (if you haven't provided the ss# to locate the account). They will also ask for your name and a telephone number for you. All Transfer Agents should capture this information on every call. 

Once you've passed the verification, you can ask the CSR if the certificate is still a valid certificate. They will ask you for the certificate number, which is usually in the upper left hand corner of the certificate. It may include letters and numbers. They will also ask how many shares and when it was issued. With those three pieces of information they can tell if the certificate was previously claimed as lost and replaced (no longer valid) or if it is a valid live certificate.

The CSR will most likely not be able to verify anything else for you over the phone because you cannot prove over the phone that you are the legal heir to the shares. You cannot sell the shares at this time, you cannot change the address, or anything else. We treat you as a third party, not the owner of the stock for security purposes. So they won't tell you the current balance or anything like that. Sorry.

To obtain a current statement and change the address the CSR will most likely advise you to submit a letter in writing along with a certified copy of the court appointment naming you as executor of your Grandparent's estate, dated within 60 days, asking to change the address to your's. Unfortunately, since you are a third party, everything must be done in writing. Again, it is our job to safeguard the owner's account and you cannot prove you are the owner over the phone.

Once you have a current statement and have the address changed, and if the certificate is valid, you have a couple options. 1. Take it to a brokerage firm. They can deposit the certificate into an account. You will most likely need to provide them with the same legal documents you provided Equiniti. 2. You can transfer the shares into an estate account (if there are multiple heirs) or an account in your name. I'm not familiar with Equiniti's transfer process but you will most likely need to fill out Transfer Forms, obtain a Medallion Stamp from a bank or brokerage firm, and possible provide another certified copy of the court appointment. You will also need to mail them the original stock certificate. My company recommends sending the certificate trackable mail and insured for 3% of the value of the stock as this is the cost to replace it if lost.

Once the shares are in your name, whether at the broker or transfer agent, they are yours to do with as you please. 

Now, I will say, there is a very good chance that the certificate was claimed as lost and replaced already. There is also a very good chance that the company had no contact from your Grandparents in over 3 years and sent the shares to your state's Unclaimed Property Office. This is called escheatment. 

I also wouldn't get too excited about stock splits that everyone else is hyping. When a stock splits the shares are either issued in a new certificate or held electronically at the Transfer Agent. So your Grandparents may have cashed those in a long time ago. I also wouldn't get excited about dividends. The fact that you didn't mention that you received any quarterly checks from the company at your Grandparent's address has me feeling the shares are escheated or already cashed.

This is pretty exciting though and it's worth the effort to chase them down. I wish my company was the Transfer Agent because then I could look it up in a few seconds and give you the good or bad news.

3,EQ," Hi OP, I actually do this for a living so I want to give you some steps to help you look into this. A lot of people are really excited for you, however what they don't know is that just because you have a paper stock certificate doesn't mean it's worth anything - it's possible the original holder thought they lost it, reported it as lost to their broker or the transfer agent and was able to still redeem the certificate. Yes, that can happen, just because a certificate is lost doesn't mean the original holder can't still get their shares. Until you have at least confirmed the certificate is valid, there's not any point in celebrating.

You have two options here - the first is you can redeem them with your broker, the second is to redeem them directly with the transfer agent. Usually a broker is going to charge you a fee, but the process is a lot easier. If there's someone you are already working with your best bet may be to go to them. The broker will provide instructions to you on what paperwork they need to get this done for you.

The ""manual"" way is to redeem it with the transfer agent. Here are some general instructions to set you on this path:

If you go to the Meredith Co Investor Relations website and scroll down, you will see the transfer agent listed as EQ Shareowner Services. I am not going to put a website or contact information in this message, because I think it's important you do this yourself. Call them & report the death of your grandfather, and speak with someone about whether certificate itself is still valid. If it is, you have completed the first part of this journey. EQ should provide some instructions to you on how you actually need to redeem the stock certificate, and the documents they require may depend on how the shares were held. If it's under your grandfather's sole name, it's possible that EQ may ask you to provide documents for the Estate of your grandfather. Are you the executor of the estate, or are you in contact with them? They may need to be the ones to work with EQ.

Often times for situations like this, the transfer agent may ask that the executor either open up a new account directly with EQ in the name of the estate, or that the Executor provide a written letter of instruction to instruct that an account be opened up for a beneficiary. In both cases, the new account holders will have to complete new account paperwork. This new account will be established to receive the shares from the deceased individual, and will hold book-entry shares - basically electronic shares. Often times this happens because companies don't like liquidating things under deceased individuals SSN's - the IRS doesn't like seeing activity under social's that are assigned to deceased individuals, so any liquidation will most likely need to happen under the EIN of the Estate, or the SSN of a beneficiary.

Once the new account is established and all the paperwork provided, then you can work with EQ to liquidate under the new account or to transfer the shares if you don't wish to liquidate. EQ will be your best friend for every stage of this process.

Final bit of advice - if you end up sending the paper certificate to anyone overnight, please  insure it. You may not need to insure it for the full amount, as like I stated before lost certificates can  still be redeemed, however redeeming a lost certificate often requires you to pay 3-5% of the underlying value of the certificate. Def throw some insurance on any original packages you send through the mail.

Edit : also make copies of anything you send out",patrick351,44,/r/stocks/comments/m4inen/how_do_i_cash_in_a_paper_stock_certificate/gquw6ae/,0.032,0.846,0.122,0.9958

I cannot stress this enough though, the transfer agency won’t be able to sell them, you’ll need a broker for that. I would suggest you actually get them in your name and just let the dividends roll in or reinvest the dividends.

Given the age of the shares you’ll also probably have to convert them to a more current form, class C01 to C04 for instance. Corporations consolidate and split securities all the time, and they typically roll into one another. 

The hardest thing is going to be proving you should be the owner. They’ll probably go into the name of your grandparents estate, but not necessarily. Talk to an estate lawyer about it.

22,ARE," 1.	if you’re not a lawyer, you’re not licensed to give legal advice. And if you ARE a lawyer, it’s generally unethical to give legal advice to someone who isn’t a client, which is why lawyers are always saying things like “I’m a lawyer, but not *your* lawyer”, and “nothing in this comment should understood as legal advice”. The lawyer-client relationship creates a number of legally-binding obligations. 

2.	It’s ok to give legal *information,* though. The distinction is, I can tell you where to find a lawyer, or the field of law a problem falls into. Anyone can. But the instant *should* or *ought to* enter the situation, you’re crossing a line. Even just “this sounds complicated, you should talk to a lawyer” is closer to the line than some lawyers will go. 

3.	Even if neither of those restrictions applied, the law is incredibly fact-dependent. The only valid answer you could give for 99.9% of questions is, “it depends”. Not because you’re being cagey, but because it does. If someone asked, 

>	“will I get out of a ticket if I get into a one-car accident going 95 on a back road, hit a railroad track, launch my car 100+ ft in the air, wreck it, walk away uninjured, ale a farmer up at 3am, be too drunk to tell him my address, have him call the police, confess all of the above to them, and blow a .31?”

   The answer would probably be “no”. But I just got a guy out of all charges in exactly that situation because it turns out the police violated his rights during arrest and most of that evidence had to be suppressed. You just can never say. 

4.	That sub by its very nature entirely ignores all of the above. Which tells you all you need to know about the quality of the “advice”.

31,CPA," Possibly, but just do things right and you're fine.  You're gonna need to talk to a CPA and a broker.  Try to find one with a physical location near you, if possible. 

I've never dealt with a physical stock before, but the money goes to your broker then to you when doing electronically. My guess is either a broker has the dividends or the company does?

Just take care of saving the money, if you invest it right, the dividends alone can become a source of income every 3 months.

I don't know the dividend situation, but you might now even want to cash the stock in and just start receiving the dividends. That will be easiest for you tax wise because the taxes will only hit once you sell.

47,DM," It depends on what they are offering the people that they take money from.

So, if they are straight up taking people's money for investing and ghosting, then yeah, that can't sustain because it's highly illegal... However, if they're offering a product, some crash course, and/or mentoring people in the stock market, then there are enough legal loopholes for them to shaft people in a MLM scheme.

My guess, they are selling their a program/knowledge/mentoring people, so what these people are paying for is ""knowledge and how to use it,"" meanwhile they disclose that any of their client's success is entirely up to them, all they can do is give them the tools to succeed and everything else is up to them... So, if it's a MLM scheme \[which it most definitely is,\] then those clients must take the knowledge they gained, advertise and sell themselves out to mentor other people, while always paying dues to their mentors above them.

They probably have people sign an extensive contract that they won't read, protecting themselves and binding these people to stipulation regarding their intellectual property or some shit, aka their program they are selling.

If I were you, I would make a throwaway email that you can inquire about this. If they are simply offering a program then there's not much you can do. If they say, we take your money, invest it, and you'll see major gains, then something is fishy and you should investigate it. Personally, I would scroll through their posts and see if there are any disgruntled comments, then DM that person to see what they did. I mean, they're taking advantage of people any way you look at it. I'd do some investigative research to protect your other friends and to protect innocent people that are going to get scammed.

116,TSM," Intel is at least 1.5 generations (\~5 years) behind Samsung and TSM. Their struggles to get their 7nm running smoothly are well-documented and they have no real plans for smaller fabs. In January, they basically gave up and announced their next generation chips are going to be designed by Intel, built by TSM.

There really isn't anything the government can do in the short-term to address the chip shortage. In the long-term, it doesn't make sense to be building more capacity for older process nodes (10nm+/maybe even 7nm+).  Intel has a long history of troubled execution at these sizes. Its really hard to make high-quality batches of chips this small. A [Chinese attempt](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Caixin/What-s-left-in-China-s-former-field-of-chip-dreams) to invest in 7nm chip production just went belly-up despite 20 billion in investment. Smart government investments in semis wouldn't go to Intel. Can't discount the possibility of stupid government investments though (which is why I closed my Intel puts in Feb).

The government letting them drill new wells when water levels are extremely low is about as accommodative as government policy can be. The Taiwanese prime minister has promised Biden to do everything they can to keep chip production going, and pissing off Uncle Sam with hungry Uncle Xi next door is political suicide.

209,COST," FWIW, I'm underwater on Costco at the moment, but I'm comfortable with my investment.  COST was way underpriced both before and after their 2nd quarter earnings report (3/4/2021).  

It has moved from $311 to $331 in the last three days and I expect it to appreciate another 20% by the end of 2021.  3rd quarter will look good and 4th quarter will trounce prior.  

2nd quarter revenue grew 14.6%, but earnings missed expectations due to $.41 Covid-19 hazard/premium pay to employees that ends in March.  So, the 3rd quarter will have some premium pay/Covid-19 expenses while the 4th quarter will have a significantly smaller expense.

Other trends in COST favor include possible membership price increase, falling gas prices (increase their gas sales margin), sales increases (1/2 of February goes in 3rd quarter) February up 15.2%, two upgrades last week following all the downward price adjustments after 2nd quarter earnings and the list goes on.

FWIW - last year Costco sold more than $52 billion of merchandise under its own Kirkland Signature brand, up 7% from 2019. That is more revenue than Coca-Cola, more than twice as much as Colgate-Palmolive and about the same as Kraft Heinz, Kellogg and Campbell Soup combined.

Considering how markets as a whole have performed the last six months, there’s no reason RKT hasn’t been a steady gainer over that time.

247,VERY," Yes, I too think that $RKT is undervalued.
I'm thinking of getting in on it for the long run, but there's some things to take into consideration IMO:

- Mortgage rates are starting to recover(rise) from the lower values in 2020. This will maybe somewhat lower the number of people buying properties, which will (in theory), lower $RKT profit numbers.

- Debt to asset is at ~83% as of today. Usually having higher d2a lowers a company's ability to freely invest in innovation and growing their business. (This is far from the worst d2a, just something to keep in mind.)

- The stock is still being shorted HEAVILY in my opinion.
Last trading session was around 38% being shorted of the available share float.


On the positive side, the sentiment is high for $RKT.
They also authorized a $1bn stock buyback following the results achieved in 2020, meaning that the company has matured financially.

Anywho, I still think that $RKT is a solid play, even at $25.
The CEO is VERY bullish, as he thinks that even at $43, the stock is still heavily undervalued compared to competitors. The company drives real value for it's customers and it has a pretty solid market cap.
I'm probably going in with $10k this week into $RKT.

269,RKT," In the weeks leading up to earnings on Nov 10, RKT traded between $19 and $21. On Nov 10, they announced $1.21 EPS compared to $0.79 estimates. RKT was right at $20 at the time. RKT spent the entire next 3 months trading sideways, between $18 and $21, while the rest of the market went through a massive speculative euphoria. 

On Feb 25, RKT announced $1.14 EPS compared to $0.855 estimates. It spiked above $40 and now appears to be settling around $25. 

The spike to 40 seemed odd, but the 3 months prior of trading sideways is the part that REALLY made no sense. Its P/S ratio was below 8, while its ROE was stupid high, over 28%. 

The fact that I can't quite pin down the correlation, if any, between RKT's share price and reality is the only reason I'm not back in. (Cashed out at $41.)

[Here's a chart of NXPI](https://imgur.com/a/XgCWotH) from the beginning of Sept 2020 to present. I've added ascending channel trendlines, using Sept 25 and Oct 28th to establish the bottom limit and Oct 12th and Dec 8th to establish the top limit.

The blue dot from 5 days ago represents the spot where I sold all my shares (held since July 21, 2020) and used the funds to instead buy two leaps  for 20 Jan 2023 170c at a premium of $42.40. As of right now, TA says that either one of two possibilities is true:

* The prevailing uptrend, denoted by the green lines, would show that I bought at the bottom and I have nothing but good times ahead.
* There could be a new prevailing downtrend, denoted by the red lines, which shows that if I want to turn a profit, I need to sell right now before the price corrects back to within the downward channel.

Those of us who hate using TA know that the only way to know which turns out to be accurate is to wait another two weeks and use hindsight.

**Primary questions**: As a TA believer, what holes can you poke in my cynicism regarding the ambiguous, hind-sighted nature of TA? Is there a finer point I should be considering?

(With the benefit of hindsight, we also now know that NXPI has just been announced as the newest inductee to the S&P 500, so I'll be doing my happy dance while money printr go brrr, but that's beside the point - the attached chart shows the closing price Friday without such knowledge, so let's operate as if we only know what we knew at that point.)",Boomtown626,1,/r/stocks/comments/m4oh74/if_any_new_investors_would_like_technical_analysis/gqxlypy/,0.039,0.89,0.072,0.7936

330,AGNC," I think a good option would be mreit's. They are still underpriced due to (IMO) overblown fears of a mortgage crisis. Note that mreit's are different from REIT's in that they invest in mortgages, not actual properties. 

They make their money through the spread on long-term vs short term. This is actually a good thing ATM since long-term rates are set to rise while short term borrowing is still easy and cheap. 

The safest choices would be AGNC and NLY, both of which have very little credit risk due to having mortgages backed 100% by the government. AGNC is the safest at a 8.7% yield, NLY has more credit risk but also a higher 10% dividend. 

I would not be surprised if they increase dividends this year. Refinance risk has gone down as well since mortgage rates are rising. 

Dividend aristocrats like T are also great plays. They've moved sideways for years and they are likely to continue holding steady, especially with 5g expansion and HBO max supporting their revenues. 7% yield that won't make you rich, but also won't blow your portfolio up.

I would put the rest into SPY since it has a 1.5% yield as well as a good chance of ending the year higher than it is now.

Note this is not what I'm personally invested in, since I have a 25 year horizon (mostly in growth atm, though I do have 15% in mREIT's and 10% in value).",Dregenfox,1,/r/stocks/comments/m4yyvz/how_to_invest_180k_with_mental_block_from_huge/gqxm6e6/,0.06,0.763,0.177,0.9824

332,ATH," 1. I most likely have deeper underlying issues, I didn't technically sell everything at March, just wanted to simplify the post but what I did had essentially the same effect. I had only started ""investing"" at the beginning of 2018. I had 70k to deploy but only put in 10k due to everything at ATH. I guess my market timing tendencies started back then. I wanted to deploy the rest after a pull back or crash. Stopped paying attention to the market shortly after and didn't even realize the market pulled back in December of 2018. So 60k cash sat in a 0% brokerage for 2 years. Then came 2020. The sentiment on reddit was that the sky was falling so not only did i not go long, i decided to go short with a leveraged inverse ETF at about 15k at literally the bottom on March 23. Then sunk cost fallacy came in, i kept hoping the short would recover so did not go long. I kept thinking, how can markets recover to pre-covid levels when the pandemic was still raging. I had only sold the short recently at a 80% loss. 
2. I guess I just cant accept the fact that going back in now would be essentially locking in my losses. And this just dragged on and on till today. I keep telling myself, why buy in now when you didnt when everything was half off. All this bubble talk lately also led me to believe we are due for a correction. 
3. My parent's investments only sat in a mutual fund for years, they stopped contributting so it was only the initial lump sum amount. I had the bright idea to sell the mutual fund and buy back the equivalent ETF so we can save on the MER. I think the idea was good but the execution was terrible. Again due to the sunk cost on my short, i keep thinking the market would crash again and I can buy back the ETF at a lower price. My greed has instead costed us dearly.",ClosetPervy,-3,/r/stocks/comments/m4yyvz/how_to_invest_180k_with_mental_block_from_huge/gqx4bml/,0.109,0.837,0.055,-0.9484

Once the prices crash, then it could be reasonable to buy and hold. Amc and gme are one thing, a huge gamble, but ccl i wouldn't even gamble on. But then I went and looked at the 12 month price. Good lord, worse investment than gme. Worse than the time i held RKT overnight + 30 minutes after open and only got 30% returns in a day instead of 60%.",Inquisitor1,1,/r/stocks/comments/m4pgmp/carnival_cruise_in_trouble/gqx95p0/,0.101,0.824,0.075,-0.6673

Starting with three in Feb 99, after the 3/2 split in Dec 1999, you (collectively) currently own 4.5 shares in HD worth approx $1,228.95

In addition, dividends have been paid quarterly for those shares. If that money was not received there may be some work involved in filing a claim.  Again there isn’t huge money here, but worth

404,DD," Depends. If you learn about risk management traditionally/mathematically, then you're looking at 15-30 stocks that should be as diverse as possible; there's a model that found that after ~25 different stocks, the rate at which you decrease the risk (std. dev.) basically starts tapering off. The idea is that you're looking to hedge risk as much as possible while maximizing your returns.

However, how many people actually follow this? This kind of explanation relies on traders/investors being 100% rational and data-driven, which no one is. That's why there's a million different equations/theories as to how to manage your portfolio-- some will keep in mind your risk tolerance, personal preferences, etc. There isn't anything wrong with having >20 different stocks since it hedges risk, but it also minimizes your gain. It's a trade-off and it comes down purely to preference.

I will agree with the other commenter though. If you're looking at a ton of different sectors, it might be a good idea to start investing in ETFs instead. Unless you trade for a living, I feel like it's way too much time to do DD on each and every company.",VfiMusic,5,/r/stocks/comments/m4hb9t/how_many_stocks_is_too_many/gqugqhp/,0.047,0.86,0.093,0.9182

409,DD," I have >100 different stocks on average. The amount doesn't seem too large for me personally because I have specific sectors/countries that I organize things by. To reduce the mental effort of keeping track of everything I try to focus very intensely on a DD for a single theme/sector for a period of time, buy what seems to be the best, and then hold it for a year or more. 

Yes there is some redundancy, but that works out for me during tax time because I can sell one at a loss if needed and then buy into its closest equivalent.",purpleyak0,2,/r/stocks/comments/m4hb9t/how_many_stocks_is_too_many/gqvqopq/,0.031,0.921,0.048,0.1646

But, realizing that GME could have FINALLY freed me to not only start my own life, and not only make up fir 25 years of missing out and misery, but I could live BEYOND my dreams.

I could literally have $483,000 (more or less) RIGHT NOW, which would definitely afford my healthcare next year (I turn 26 at the end of the year), I could get away from all of these right-wing extremists, I could avoid having to work away the rest of my 20s (I am so far behind the only way I can catch up otherwise is probably working another job over 40 hours a week, somehow going to school fulltime too, and likely paying for therapy more than once a month, which is all insurance will pay for) and barely even have time to sleep (which I struggle with even when I DO have time, I just can’t fall asleep early at night).

The idea of putting my stimulus and tax return (a total of over $2,300) into more secure long-term stocks definitely seems promising for years or decades down the road, but it’s depressing as f*ck, because I see myself being miserable and lonely, either overworking a terrible job, or even being homeless until I get big returns.

If I wasn’t ready to immediately move out so I could plan that better, I could at least pay my parents more rent to help them out better (they have their own debts).

I was ready to throw my stimulus and tax return into CLVS and PGEN, as these are SUPPOSEDLY the next short squeezes, but I’m not sure that will happen. And supposedly Jack in the Box and Chili’s.

I’m also planning on investing in weed stocks as the US is legalizing marijuana, I support this (although don’t personally smoke, as I take medication that would have dangerous reactions like serotonin syndrome) and think it’s safe to say that these companies will blow up, and a lot of these stocks are only like $0.30 a share right now. Also mushroom and psychedelic stocks (microdosing is already legal).

If I made all that money from GME I could afford to invest in the short-term AND long-term, AND live it up RIGHT NOW, but I can’t go back in time, so trying to find the next play.

My money is definitely not growing just sitting in a savings account though. I’m not going to take it ALL out, but I might take some extra in addition to my stimulus and tax return.

I’m 25, I don’t want to be poor and/or have to tightly budget until I’m an old man. Especially if that means I have to spend my life in either a dangerous part of a city or a small town/rural area (NEVER AGAIN!)

MARKET CAP **$155.94M.**

SHARES OUTSTANDING **18.03M.**

PUBLIC FLOAT **2.72M, rest of float owned by insiders and institutions.**

Vanguard recently bought 1,1mln shares, other institutions loading shares as well. 

Phase 3 results coming up Q3 2021.

Management has previously built multiple billion dollar businesses and sold 1 of them to J&J. Management are founders of Remicade, 4th most used drug in the world.

Most of management are not getting paid directly, but instead through rise in equity value (share price increase).

Company was completely under the radar for some time, but is now gaining attention fast!

If you look at the graph, the drop from 11 - 2USD was due to SPAC problems and has nothing to do with the company, the problems are behind them now.

For me Federal tax max cap of 35% starts on every dollar past 150k i believe. But it gets worse.... I owe state taxes of 5.25%. Then I gotta pay Social Security Tax on this money so there goes another 12%, oh dont forget medicare thats another 2.9% (Social Security and Medicare are full values since the income doesn't come from an employer that is splitting the cost with you). 

In total I will be facing a tax rate of around 55.5% all things said and done for every dollar over the max cap.... thats just fucking BS... Im all for paying taxes - but a man/woman shouldn't have to give up more than .25% of their income to the government.

461,MSCI," The general rule of thumb is that you should keep the majority of your investments in funds as long as you're inexperienced in terms of investing/trading. In other words: if you don't know how to read balance sheets, calculate [insert fancy finance term] ratios and predict prices based on recent news articles, be really careful with regular stonks.

Time *in* the market, beats *timing* the market. Continue your reinvestment strategy. Diversify your portfolio as you build it up. Until you build up to a 20-30k diversified portfolio, ignore red numbers. They don't exist. You've done your research and you believe in the company, right? Well, so long as you aren't seeing articles about them going insolvent, *don't sell*. 

Once your portfolio becomes thicc and juicily diversified, start looking at the red numbers. You believe in these companies, right? *Buy the dip*. That's the money. Find value, where many others don't see it. Alternatively, you could further diversify your portfolio by searching for value in the market, or if you're all green, buy more of your lowest priced holdings.

That said, *always do your DD - Due diligence.* Research every company you want to buy, in and out. Scour their balance sheets, look at institutional interest, look at insider transactions, etc. I'd bet there's tons of YouTube videos showing budding investors how to research the fundamentals of a company; how to look for value in a stock.

Recessions last for a while. If you hold those positions in cash you'll be losing to inflation in a major way. I can keep it growing in something like KO and sell off once my positions bottom out.  Even if I believe in a stock long term there's no reason to ride it down that far except boomer sentiment or because I don't care to actively manage my portfolio",Petty-Penelope,2,/r/stocks/comments/m4sq22/what_is_the_point_in_recession_proofing_a/gqw64io/,0.152,0.816,0.032,-0.9322

505,PB," Don't get too excited or FOMO'd into investing all in one go. Stick with your dollar cost averaging. The market is in a weird moment right now with lots of new investors and volatility. Lot's of people saying we're in a massive bubble so be careful. Having 20-30% of your money on the side is a good strategy so that if there is a big dip or crash you can put money in and benefit from the gains that will follow.

Couple of main strategies are growth investing and value investing. I like value investing because I can use metrics to analyse stocks.

I tend to use this as my main way to screen stocks:

PE Ratio (Price to Earnings) **< 25** means stock undervalued

PEG Ratio (Price to Earnings Growth) **< 1** means stock is undervalued

PB Ratio (Price to Book) **< 3** is good

All this info can be found on Yahoo Finance and other sites for free but I would also recommend SimplyWallSt, you can get a free trial to analyse stocks and filter by markets, sectors and these metrics plus much more.

Best strategy is a long term one which you seem to have identified but if you want to try more risky methods as well as your safer S&P500 strategy then there's plenty of trading apps you can use and maybe set aside a portion of your money that you want to use for these manual  trades.

Remember to be diversified, it will limit your gains but it will also limit your losses. Keep educating yourself, you seem like you're on the right track. Far too many people getting involved as a get rich quick plan, which is the total wrong way to go about things.

Choose a strategy, stick to it, stick to your ratios of how much money you're going to invest. Take your profits at certain targets. You've only made a gain or loss once the trade is closed. In general holding for a long time will get you gains but if you're going for a more day trading route you need to set targets for taking profits.

Eg. you buy a stock at 50$ and you think it's fair value is 100$, there's nothing wrong with taking profits at 60/70/80/90$",naturalfractal,6,/r/stocks/comments/m4xq26/new_to_the_investing_world/gqwxcld/,0.052,0.76,0.188,0.9949

507,UK," No worries man, best of luck with it!

Lots of good YouTube channels you can learn a lot from too, would recommend PensionCraft, Andrei Jikh, Graham Stephan, Damien Talks Money.

Not read these books but heard good things about them, The Intelligent Investor by Ben Graham and One Up On WallSt by Peter Lynch.

Definitely try out SimplyWallSt, best stock screener I've found and very reasonably priced, there's other analyst companies like Zacks and Motley Fool but I love the layout of SimplyWallst and the free trial makes it worth giving it a go, found it very helpful as a beginner.

Another strategy people invest in is Dividend investing where companies essentially pay you a passive income for just being invested with them, usually companies that have had such huge past success that they can give money back to investors. The counter argument to this is that they're not reinvesting the money back into the business so their growth might be limited, but if it's a massive company anyway that's probably why they choose to pay dividends since their growth potential isn't going to be as big as a smaller market cap stock. There's a lot of noise and info out there so it can be difficult to choose a strategy or method. You don't have to stick with one though, you can have a couple of strategies.

A well diversified portfolio should have 40-80 stocks but I like having \~100.

510,TSLA," don't forget that ""options"" is an INCREDIBLY broad term with many different levels to it.

you can absolutely make huge gains with normal shares and without touching options. (just look how much money someone would have now if they put $5k into TSLA in early 2020). it's just harder to make big gains, ESPECIALLY if you don't have a ton of capital to put into a company that you think might double or 3x in a couple years.

i was EXTREMELY confident disney was going to skyrocket from the $90/share it was going for a year ago, but it's not like i could simply say ""ok, i'm going to put $200k into this and next year my money will double and i'll have $200k of profit"". 

think of it this way, there's a big difference between a 100% rate of return on $1k than there is on $100k. it takes money to make money. now don't be discouraged by that, because with compounding growth, shares are going to grow over time and you'll typically end up with much more than you put in, it's just  not necessarily ""get quick rich and retire in 2-3 years"" for most people with normal income/savings.

on simple options (covered calls, possibly some puts), there's a lot of capability for someone to take their holdings and enhance those gains. you're not doing anything high risk like some option strategies, you're just saying ""hey, i'll take $100 from you now, and if these 100 shares that i paid $35 for go up over $50, i'll sell them for $50 no matter what they cost. you win either way because either it doesn't strike and you keep the premium, or it does strike and you made a profit on your investment.

if the idea of options make you uncomfortable, just ignore them and pretend they don't exist. you can make a solid return without them just from share growth and dividend payouts. if you do want to experiment with them, there's nothing wrong with going slow at first.

From what I read, you've little confidence in many of your picks, which is not a good sign. Do you know what Crayon does? Do you know 70% of their business is from a single client? (Microsoft, which is good, but still a single client). To know everything about a company you own will increase conviction and will be easy to stick with it in downturns. 

If you're a beginner, I would advise you to invest first in ETF such as VOO, VTI, QQQ or even SMH if you know the Semiconductors market. There are EU alternatives as well to those ones. I would allocate 90% to ETF, and 10% to stock picking while learning. In the meantime learn how to evaluate a company, to read financial statements or at the very least the concepts of PE, PS, PB, PEG, cash flow etc. Once you get more skilled in picking stocks, I'd increase my single stock %.

Always keep something like 15% cash for good opportunities like last month. By studying and identifying the company you like you'll be ready when everyone panics to buy them at a discount, because you've done your homework before.

When 2020 arrived I had almost 2 years of f**k ups behind me and I was ready: bought some stuff near the bottom with (too little) % of my cash and then set an aggressive weekly auto savings in the mentioned ETF. Never looked back. Can't predict the market, can't time it, if you're young just invest and ride it. My 2 cents.

532,VERY," Options are a great way to see insane gains depending on risk tolerance. Educating urself on how they work could be financially life changing. Definitely was for me

It’s also a way to get wiped out if u don’t take the time to learn how they work and u don’t have a stomach for volatility, so I’d be VERY careful with them if u don’t know wtf ure doing",upandfastLFGG,1,/r/stocks/comments/m4l0mp/annual_average_return/gqvkdwf/,0.111,0.709,0.181,0.6626

534,CLOV," I'm not too familiar with Hindenburg before the CLOV short report but Citron has been coasting off their (correct) thesis on Valeant for several years. I remember he was trying to target Shopify, Nvidia, and Tesla but was wrong. Then got fucked on GME.

I think they split their things up into their legitimate convictions and then there's some backroom stuff going on where they target companies to give entry opportunities to, I guess other firms they have some affiliation with? Because a few months later they generally announce they close the short and announce they're out.

Then why not remain short indefinitely and ride it to zero since their thesis often amounts to accusations of outright fraud? If they're concerned with short squeezes it seems like they had longer to ride it down before covering. It's not some skepticism but accusation of outright fraud: in other words an all-or-nothing proposition. With SPACs the last 3 short reports are very heavy with insinuation and scare language. The common investor probably does not have a good familiarity with what a DoJ inquiry or affiliated parties among customers means - so the authors will maximize the sinister quality of it.

I'm seeing this with Triteras and with Phase2. I saw  a wave of funds file Form 13F on fintel which means that the institutions don't take the thesis seriously, because this was a month after the short presentation. Other longs researching this reached out directly to Phase2 asking for more info on the blockchain transactions to verify if the management's response was true and got angry reactions instead of providing it when it was in their best interest to do so. So waited to get in below $7, then boom Western Union partnership and it spikes to 8.00.

And there's also a bunch of smaller no name hedge funds on Twitter usually hopping on the bandwagon, also claiming to immediately cover their shorts way too soon if they actually believed they were correct. So it's just a part of the overall Stocktwits and media message and sentiment game.

So they're not necessarily enemies, they create tons of opportunities. With the TRIT timeline I got the chance to see how the smart money responded (by going long en masse, which I could publicly see on fintel in late Feb, not a secret at all), read the rebuttals and debates, and then I could follow, all before the rip up comes. It felt strange to have such a big window for a regular retail investor to grasp the situation and get in, like a free info arbitrage trade.  I think it's a pretty weak effort to keep people out, but if you wait a few months after SPACs IPO for the attack, seems like a great opportunity to swoop in with a lot more information. Of course if you're already in BEFORE the short attack it will suck.

However, with NKLA, Hindenburg was absolutely dead on. But the style of presentation is completely different. Brutally and fully destructive, scorched earth, every little sordid detail laid out (like the president of the battery company with the scam tech blowing the money on prostitutes lol). Meaning, they use all the ammunition and damning evidence they have: what does this imply when they don't? They resort to insinuation and 'hint hint' language when they lack it, which seems to be the case with CLOV. In the future I really think they're going to mix it up and make it less obvious, but right now they don't care since it's just a couple guys in specific communities that get to exploit them.

But SPAK did find a bottom recently, a few people called it correctly that I've been trading/investing with. The opinion I've seen is that we're going to look back at this time and won't be able to believe we got into all these companies at such cheap prices.

Whether intentional or not, this is trying to condition the savvy investor to not take part in SPACs immediately and wait for the short reports. I think there is truth to Wall Street despising the SPAC process for getting retail investors into IPOs so much cheaper.

you're ignoring the cost of the premium. if you're buying a $50 call for a $56 share, the odds are pretty good that the premium is going to be around $6/share.

on to why someone would sell a call like this, is because they think the price of the stock will go down and take the call out of the money before anyone exercises it (since TYPICALLY people will excercise at expiration).

if that $56 share drops down to $45, the $50 option is worthless (until the stock goes back above the strike). to use a more real example, look at AAPL. it was trading for 133/share in mid february. if someone sold a 1 month call with a 125 strike, they would have gotten a big premium. now, the price is around 120 a share, so that would be out of the money even though it was in the money when the option was sold, and may expire worthless.",reaper527,1,/r/stocks/comments/m502k4/why_would_there_be_a_call_strike_price_lower_than/gqxpr8j/,0.061,0.844,0.095,0.765

555,ATH, I wouldn't recommend 5 what's so ever. I was stupid enough to sell at the bottom of March last year and I still haven't bought back in. Lost out on more than 2 years of my salary in gains. Not to mention the cash had been sitting in my brokerage earning 0% interest for a year now. It has been a devastating experience and I'm still in a very dark place. I kept hoping for a crash so i can buy back in at least a bit cheaper but now I don't think i can hold off any longer with so much great news on the horizon. I will need to bite the bullet and eat the 60-70% loss. It kills me that I only came to terms with it after the historic rally last week and not when the market was down 2 weeks earlier.

561,DCF," Generally they get into so-called ""analyst calls"" with company's management during which management presents their 'guidance' i.e. expectations on how the business is going to perform. This forms a basis for further analysis, as management often or always is bullish on future performance. Then the analyst gathers a fact base to challenge management's assumptions: does the market grow in line with guidance? are revenue projections solid? are cost projections solid? are there any risks? what about debt? any major strategic moves? Ultimately, the analysts builds a financial model based on which they project future cash flows and value a company using on DCF. Concurrently, they use multiple-based valuations i.e. compare the company to its peers. Based on that they arrive at an implied share price and compare with the current share price. If the implied is noticeably higher, they issue a buy recommendation.

That's in a nutshell. There's of course much more detail to it but for that I suggest you look into professional literature on corporate finance, fundamental analysis and valuation.",ETFinvestorIBKR,6,/r/stocks/comments/m52z9k/how_do_stock_analysts_predict_stock_growth/gqxr3pd/,0.019,0.924,0.057,0.5122

581,TSLA," I think Musk, like most entrepreneurs, are trying to sell us the future because we, like most consumers, get tired of the present and aroused by the unobtainable. If anyone buys what a businessman is selling you need to read the fine print -- the legal and realistic truth.

Case in point if you're willing to keep reading. During the meteoric rise of TSLA (during November, I believe) before they became part of the S&P, Musk promised a vehicle he had previous denied even existing; in fact, he had spoken out against making the vehicle -- which resembled something more than an SUV but less than a truck. He had to promise the stars of only to get his stock price to the moon (#NoOneLeftBehind). This is what businessmen like to do and Musk is not even the 100th person to do it.

Granted, one day...Lord knows when that might be...the Level 5 will be so commonplace and effective that this situation will be moot, but technology only gets better as we can generate the capacity for it and production of it.

If your friend feels cheated, so were we all when we were young and bought ""experimental"" doo-dads and whatnots because we were ""promised"" an expectation that inevitably fell short. Musk should be held accountable, as any manufacturer should be, but that fine print is tricky. The lawyers get ahold of products ling before the FDA, DOT, or any of their ilk do. There is some clause somewhere in the microscopic inking that says ""Buyer beware"" but no one can read 6 pt, even on a 4k res screen.

If you're concerned about lockdowns then buy Amazon, Zoom, or take all of your money out of the market.

But Biden is inentivized to get the economy back open again and kids in school.

I understand the epidemiology before you posted this. It has been clear for months that the UK variant is the 500 pound gorilla. But too many Americans are not ready to go to lockdowns again and are big on getting the vaccines.

If you see that there is a huge increase in the mortality rates back to where they were at the peak in the US (after vaccines are distributed), then I'd be more confident in lockdowns.",LavenderAutist,2,/r/stocks/comments/m53jxd/incoming_lockdowns/gqxzj7k/,0.031,0.87,0.1,0.8217

Wales and Scotland are both easing restrictions at a greater rate than England, and given you following our news you'll know they have both been a lot more cautious than England. 

Flights are due to run on the 17th May. Our airport closed in December for comparison. Kids are already back at school. None essential retail is scheduled for April. June for everything else. 

There's been a big push to end lockdown early but the UK government (at least for England) are refusing that and are sticking to the original plan.
