1,GME," I look for companies that are severely undervalued and are entering a digital transformation of their business. 

The time horizon is at least 3-5 years, most likely a decade. 

Successful plays in the past was Dominos (4500% in ten years), Nike (1100% I'm eight years), Netflix (980% in six years), Adidas (480% in six years).

Currently it's GameStop, with an investment time horizon of probably also ten years.


Indicators for a successful play is a change of leadership (ideally entire c level replacement), the declared intend to go digital first, activist investors, insider activity, the support of the board of that motive, funding in place as well as partnerships with competency partners like cloud providers and transformation consultancies.

7,STAG," O and STAG are both REITs, they invest in real estate and pay income to the shareholders. By law they're required to pay 90% of their profit to shareholders as dividends.

O's entire identity is built around the fact that they've never cut dividends and have increased them every year for over 25 years, including through recessions and bear markets. The company name is ""Realty Income"" and their tagline is ""The Monthly Dividend Company"". I own enough O that I get around $300/mo in dividends from them and I just re-invest it.

I don't know enough about STAG to comment on it, but I've held O for a while. I don't recommend making it your primary investment, I own it for diversification.

If you're really interested in the idea of earning income from dividends, do some research into Dividend Growth Investing (DGI). Investing in companies that have historically raised dividends every year - including through recessions and bear markets - gives you an income stream that beats inflation and generally isn't affected by market crashes. The general idea is that you invest in around 25 ""dividend champion"" companies in various sectors and if one cuts their dividend, you sell it and buy something else so you can keep that income stream coming.

People here will argue that DGI won't outperform a broad market index with overall long-term total returns. But the point isn't to maximize total returns, it's to earn income without selling your positions. It makes more sense for younger folks to focus on total return, but once you're near retirement and your needs are income and not growth, DGI can be a good strategy. It's better than relying on traditional income producing assets like bonds.",irresponsible_owl,11,/r/investing/comments/nklmfn/the_single_greatest_edge_an_investor_can_have/gze50kn/,0.045,0.848,0.107,0.9616
8,ABR," Thanks u/irresponsible_owl.  He summed up O pretty well, so I will concentrate on STAG.

STAG Industrial is a self-managed REIT that focuses on acquiring and leasing industrial properties across the U.S. It has an enterprise value of over $7B, and owns 494 total properties across 39 states, covering 99.1M square feet. What sets STAG apart from its peers Prologis (PLD), Duke Realty (DRE), and Rexford Industrial (REXR) is its focus on secondary markets, which are less competitive and come with higher cap rates.  
  
Rather than blindly bidding on â€˜hot propertiesâ€™ in Tier 1 markets, STAG takes an analytically-driven approach towards sourcing and acquiring properties that produce the best risk-adjusted returns. This is supported by the 1,250 transactions that passed initial triage for investment consideration in 2020, of which only 224 transactions were underwritten, of which an even fewer 39 transactions actually closed. This means that only 3% of the initially sourced transactions were finally acquired.  
  
STAGâ€™s management can afford to be choosy, as it operates in a highly fragmented market thatâ€™s $1 Trillion in size, of which STAGâ€™s share represents just 0.5%. As an acquirer of single-tenant properties (hence the letters ST in STAG), STAG also operates from an advantageous position. Thatâ€™s because itâ€™s able to spread the so-called â€˜binary riskâ€™ of single tenant properties across its asset base of nearly 500 properties.  
  
As such, while a single-tenant property is risky to a private owner of one or just a few properties, it has far more value for STAG, as itâ€™s able to manage the risk of tenant defaults across its sea of properties. This results in the mispricing of assets, which STAG is keen to take advantage of.  
  
This, combined with the secondary market focus, has resulted in profitable growth for the company, which has a 5.3% implied cap rate, comparing favorably to the 3.9% peer average. Meanwhile, STAG has a well-diversified and strong tenant base, of which 86% have annual revenue over $100M, and 61% have revenue over $1B. As seen below, STAGâ€™s top 10 tenants represent just 12.5% of the portfolio ABR (annual base rent) with Amazon (AMZN) being the top tenant, along with other well-regarded names such as XPO Logistics (XPO), FedEx (FDX), and WestRock (WRK).",Gurthang99,6,/r/investing/comments/nklmfn/the_single_greatest_edge_an_investor_can_have/gzea63q/,0.01,0.86,0.13,0.9906

22,PB," Value investing is about present and projected cashflow in relation to price, looking for those that are mispriced. Value indexing is made from picking companies at the opposite ends of a classification based on a handful of metrics. [Here's](http://www.crsp.org/files/Equity-Indexes-Methodology-Guide_0.pdf#page=37) how they make the underlying index to VTV, basically put stocks on a scale of PE/PB/PS/div ratios for value, future and historic growth/ROA for growth and chop the middle. Sure, Exxon gets in that package and I'm sure a great many companies, but I'm not sure there is denying that it will also include the low/no-growth companies that the market values poorly. Going for something as simple as <X PB worked in the time of Graham, but we are no longer in those times and throwing in a few more metrics and a cute multi-parameter model to automate the process (or even better, a Monte Carlo simulation [^TM](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target-2/), but I digress) doesn't solve the issue of such an oversimplification.

I'm not saying that I necessarily see them as baskets of dead companies (although it is written like that), I just don't see how indexing accomplishes the same role as value investing. I'm sure there is plenty of correlation between the aggregate performance of both since the latter are more likely to converge on stocks within those bounds then the one set for growth indexes, but I'd be shocked if any value investor would be interested in buying everything in that band (tho I'd be curious to hear if there is, as long as it's not the guy giving a Google Talk on his atrociously performing fund using a low-CAPE strategy based on theory and access to OPM). Besides, the orthogonality set by those ETF-sellers between value and growth is a bit funny and seemingly [irreconcilable with the philosophy](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1992.html) (CTRL-F to ""fuzzy thinking""), but I guess selling ""low-growth"" ETFs has less of a ring to it... and who doesn't want to make a 0.04% commission on capital from an automated process (nonetheless, bless Vanguard and Mr. Bogle, of course).

>value investing has outperformed the SP500 historically

Perhaps, so how do you reconcile that with the under performance of value indexes? Sure a bull-market is not the best playground for value investors, but VV slaughtered VTV on all accounts and there's a gaping bear market in the middle of their history. VTV had a slightly worse drawdawn in '08 and a slower recovery thereafter. The only over performance I see from VTV is in the ramp up from 2004 to 2008. If you do this exercise with BRK and SPY, you'll find BRK under-performed in 2002-08 and over-performed for the drawdawn and recovery (as you'd expect per Buffett's own but ancient letters).",skeptophilic,2,/r/investing/comments/nklmfn/the_single_greatest_edge_an_investor_can_have/gzfqrow/,0.058,0.786,0.156,0.9923

25,IMO," > I'm not saying that I necessarily see them as baskets of dead companies (although it is written like that), I just don't see how indexing accomplishes the same role as value investing.

The idea is that prices are somewhat dictated by analysts that look at these details, and you're just buying market cap weights of companies that fit the value criteria.

What going with value indexes instead of overall market cap weighted funds is avoiding overhyped growth stocks.

IMO in the current market where you have unprofitable companies like Coinbase and RBLX trading at 50x revenues, value is a good way to avoid much of the overvalued hype. If you invested in value before the tech bubble crash, you wouldn't have even lost money while the NASDAQ dropped 75%.

The problem is growth is at some point the growth is priced in, perhaps a little too much. If growth companies don't grow as fast as anticipated, they can lose a lot of value.

26,RBLX," > I'm not saying that I necessarily see them as baskets of dead companies (although it is written like that), I just don't see how indexing accomplishes the same role as value investing.

The idea is that prices are somewhat dictated by analysts that look at these details, and you're just buying market cap weights of companies that fit the value criteria.

What going with value indexes instead of overall market cap weighted funds is avoiding overhyped growth stocks.

IMO in the current market where you have unprofitable companies like Coinbase and RBLX trading at 50x revenues, value is a good way to avoid much of the overvalued hype. If you invested in value before the tech bubble crash, you wouldn't have even lost money while the NASDAQ dropped 75%.

The problem is growth is at some point the growth is priced in, perhaps a little too much. If growth companies don't grow as fast as anticipated, they can lose a lot of value.

27,IMO," Right. Everyone laughed at Al Gore talking about a lock box for social security, but that's what's needed both for Social Security and for a national fund like this. But nowadays, you've got people advocating for an end of ""payroll tax"" convienently omitting that's advocating for the end of social security. So, I'll go back to the beginning, and say I haven't figured out the details, but even if I didn't, it would be impossible to do in the current political climate or probably any future political climate.

It would be an enormous expenditure from current citizens and corporations, for the primary benefit of people who haven't been born yet. It would probably be fair considering how much debt we've ladened them with, but any politician intent on getting more money into their constituents pockets would aim first and foremost at this, proclaiming ""you're paying taxes into a program that you won't ever see come back to you"".

Really, something like this should have been embarked upon when social security was first created. It's impossible today.

32,DCF," Yes. My initial investment was Â£3000. Do you want my current net worth to calculate the CAGR based on that? If you do so it would be over 80%. 

>So as far as we understand, you held one stock for ten years

Initially I bought one stock, exactly. I was a broke uni student. What do you expect? That I buy a diversified portfolio of dividend stocks and earn 50 quid in 5 years?

>... and got very lucky

Arguable. I had reasons for making the initial decisions and had checkpoints in place, which I also described in the initial point. Calling it ""luck"" is discrediting the thorough analysis necessary to find a company like those mentioned, as well as the understanding necessary to grasp how and when a digital transformation looks promising.

>Are you telling us that you only held Nike, then you only held Adidas, then you only held Dominos

Obviously not. Only someone being intentionally obtuse could assume this. I even said I bought Dominos in 2010 and held for ten years as my first investment as a student. This takes us to 2020. How could I have possibly held Nike and Adidas and Netflix for multiple years if they would have been my only investments? Is that really how you argue? Strawmanning my argument and ad hominems? 

If you want to go back and read the first post again? I lead with my style of investing: **pick companies that are entering digital transformations.** I believe that we are at in the midst of the fourth industrial revolution, and that it will fundamentally change the way we live our lives. Only companies acknowledging this change, and adapting to it will be successful. If you want to talk more about this thesis, I am happy to have this discussion, but you will have to leave your personal attacks out.

Lastly, re: ""definition of investing"":

What you are advocating for, is not investing at all: It is longish term trading.

If you want to I'll use the same Graham quote as you. You failed at the first hurdle: 
>upon thorough analysis

You did not do a thorough analysis. You did a DCF, which i specifically said will not work, and called it a day! 
A DCF assumes the business will continue doing things as it is. A **digital transformation** is the exact opposite of doing same old same old.

It feels to me as if you, since you're a moderator in an online forum on investing, think you are the ultimate authority on investing, which is absurd on a good day. 

If you want to actually discuss my main thesis, that digital transformations are the highest return investment today, I am happy to.

* Risk tolerance: high risk is ok if it's expected to recover in the long term (SP500). Otherwise, looking to diversify among at least 3 not strongly correlated sectors with at most 30% expected loss in each (SP500, EU REITs, something else?).
* Have holdings in steel (LEAPs), SP500 (LEAPs), GME (commons), PLTR (LEAPs, it was a stupid bet) - each at 5% of the portfolio
* 110% of my portfolio (on margin) is in SPACs, waiting for them to rebound. At the very least, at 2% below NAV I expect them to cover margin costs.

59,PV," I think this is a conversation you should both have with a neutral party, a financial adviser.

Money matters are a big source of marital discord, and you want to ensure that both of you are equally informed and equal partners in making financial decisions, rather than equally uninformed.

As much money as you have, understand that every dollar of principal you lose is PV \* (1 + r)^(nt) future dollars gone forever, and time is one thing you cannot buy back.

There is a serious liquidity crisis on the horizon, very likely in the next 12 to 18 months, and it could obliterate the $150k you're seeking to invest if suddenly you need some portion of that $150k.  For reference, the crash of 2000 saw market value decline by 75% and market indicators are pointing in much the same direction as they were in 2000.  So this also bears impact on the totality of your investment/retirement capital.... every penny counts.

When people use expressions like ""I've finally convinced her to..."" it doesn't tell me that you both equally understand the risks involved, and right now the risks are high.  I can tell you from personal experience that this can mushroom quickly into a marriage ending event, through no action or inaction of your own.  You are putting yourselves at the mercy of the market at a time when uncertainty looms and, worse, there's almost nowhere to shelter money from inflation because interest rates are so low.

For me, risk averse doesn't mean not taking risks but it means understanding that if I lose 30% of my portfolio, I have to generate an improbable 42% return on the remaining capital just to break even, by which time I've lost a year (or fourteen, in the case of the 2000 crash)... So it sounds like paying down the house ($400k is a lot to owe on a house, unless you are a billionaire) may be your first priority but you perhaps need a professional to articulate the scenarios to both of you so that you're fully aligned on the risks of A vs. B vs. C.

As a sidenote: With the amount of capital you have, I would consider paying 1-2% AUM to have an actively managed portfolio so you can focus on your careers.",th3cr1t1c,1,/r/investing/comments/nkl62k/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gzecqvi/,0.095,0.851,0.054,-0.8994

I would watch which ones you are interested in, not all of them are the same.

AMD - Personal Computers mostly, both GPU and CPU.

INTC - Business oriented, most revenue comes from server chips but still huge in the Personal Computer market, also some speculation of INTC breaking into the GPU market.

IBM - Servers, proprietary systems and single-task machines? I think their mission statement has shifted a bit since the 90s and i'm not informed as well on their dealings. I always think super computers tucked away 500ft underground or maybe that electronic cash register at walmart? not sure...

TSM - Only one out of the pack that doesn't design it's own chips. Manufactures chips on the behalf of other companies, sensitive to foriegn relations and tariffs as... It's in Taiwan.

NVDA - Bull or Bust IMO, they used to or maybe still do make board controllers and south bridges, but the real money is in their GPUs. There is an excess demand for their GPUs and they simply cannot fill them all. If Crypto Mining falls out of fashion brace for sharp decline, 2nd hand market will be flooded with GPUs, scalpers will disappear and miners will likely stop buying them. Supposedly NVDA won't be affected by this because the demand has always beat supply in this market. NVDA sells to retailers at MSRP, not actual customers and retailers have always been keen to buy as much stock of GPUs as they can in the past, but if crypto mining falls out? Who knows.

AAPL - Apple makes all of it's own chips for it's own devices, so it's kind of a closed loop but again, it does still make chips, like the upcoming M2\*\*\*

100,TLRY," In real estate, personally I like RDFN; Glenn Kelman is an excellent CEO and I feel comfortable with him at the helm with a small position. Real Estate ibuying really is a theme that requires a lot of capital and a lot of risk and it's really something that will work or it won't. Additionally, ibuying (Zillow/Redfin and others) hasn't even gone through a more sustained downturn yet. I don't think it'll be an easy path even if it does but if you can sell the house and all the other layers of service required in that transaction on top of it, that's interesting.

From the Q2 2019 Redfin call:

""**So we are quite committed to this business, but anyone in this business should be scared. And if they aren't scared, you should
be scared because we are taking significant capital risk and most of the folks in the space are losing tons of money and you have to have a clear
path to profit.** So you have to know exactly how scale is going to let you renovate homes more efficiently. You have to know exactly how you're
going to be able to market those homes directly to the buyer. And it's hard to pull apart because when you're growing really fast, you're paying
forward some of your growth and that limits your margins, but you're also trying to get more efficient. And whenever you're going to get more
efficient and grow at the same time, it's just a real challenge. And so we're just trying to be eyes wide open about those risks, and I think that's the
way you would want us to be. And what drives me crazy about this space is that almost everybody in the space accounts for their margins differently,
which makes it hard for you to give an apples-to-apples comparison of who's really making money and who's losing money and how much money
they're losing. That's the reason we invented accounting principles. I wish we would use them more consistently.""

Kelman is very honest/straightforward on Redfin calls (it's not just ""to the moon!"", it's honest about things like the above talking about the degree of risk in things like ibuying) and goes into a lot of detail.

TLRY - personally, I'm not interested in the pure play growers, I'd rather the MSOs (and even those I don't have large positions in - I think cannabis is absolutely a long-term theme but not without obstacles and Canada's overproduction shows what happens when you overestimate demand.)

104,SRNG," I still think last year was the ""next big growth stock"" year and this year is going to be more difficult for growth overall.

That's a company that I've wanted to own for probably 4-5 years now and view as a 5-10 year story. I'm not looking for ""the next big thing"" for a while, the primary focus in terms of the things that I've been adding in over the last several months as aggressive growth positions got trimmed or sold is ""high quality, profitable thing with a great track record thing that I don't have to think that much about.""",dvdmovie1,1,/r/investing/comments/nkl6nk/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gzfkeq8/,0.033,0.836,0.131,0.9187

AMD - Consistently hits milestones and steadily growing, far from outing intel on it's PC home turf but they have been chipping away at intel's grip on the market and intel has been slow to respond in any meaningful way on all fronts.

These are probably the big two I see going up, but the technology sector is all about innovation and whoever gets the next big thing out first is going to be the winner hands down.
