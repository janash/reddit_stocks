0,ASRT," I’m a pharmacist and i’ve posted this before but i’m not sure why reddit is so bullish on this stock.

All of these drugs are widely— and i mean overly available where you can pay $10-30 for a 90 days supply. Meanwhile ASRT drugs have WACs >600-$700 meaning that if the patients insurance doesn’t pick up the majority of the cost, the copays could be crazy. How do brands compete with higher copays? Copay cards. Who got rid of their copay cards for Vivlodex and Zorvolex? ASRT last year. 

I’d be more bullish if they had their copay cards still around but nope :(",SoundSelection,449,/r/pennystocks/comments/m399ci/asrt_assertio_therapeutics_why_i_invested_in_them/gqnrg1j/,0.07,0.901,0.029,-0.5258

2,DD," I read your DD so good work on that. However, I am not convinced:

- They sell NSAIDs which are commonly prescribed by physicians, in The Netherlands you can actually buy them over-the-counter without any prescription. Except for the meloxicam
- They sell a morphine like substance which is commonly prescribed as a pain medication

For both of these types of medication, we already have a slow released form which will allow you to take two pills per day. So how will their technology help them with their medication?

Also, competition is extremely high since many pharmacies make these medications. As a physician I do not see any competitive advantage.

Just because they cut costs and went from bankrupt to a slightly less terrible company does not make them a BUY.",pashtun92,20,/r/pennystocks/comments/m399ci/asrt_assertio_therapeutics_why_i_invested_in_them/gqnzp7g/,0.112,0.795,0.094,-0.3535

5,DD," I work in med industry. Those **brand** names Assertio holds? Barely seen them; closest is Indocin prescribed but still dispensed generic. Only other is Nucynta, which as your DD summarizes, they let go. They may have a market for the products you named elsewhere in certain regions of US or around world, but not in my geographical area. The 11.3 million prescriptions number you give is worrisome, because those may be vast majority generics from competitors. Like, diclofenac is Voltaren gel which just came to market as OTC; you usually see oral diclofenac in delayed-release tablets, not as capsules which is what you say Assertio has.

One question, why do you figure Covid was responsible for the poor numbers posted?  Assertio’s products seem to be the type that people need all the time? Covid could perhaps make it harder for people to get appointments with their Dr’s, therefore some prescriptions don’t get written. That’s a problem that doesn’t seem to be difficult to fix.. where are these losses coming from then?

Now, I did a quick DD.

The split happened on September 21st 2020 and was 1 for 10. You can see the downward trend in the stock price before the split. That was because their earnings, released August 7th, were a huge disappointment. After the split happened you can see the share price consolidated for a while.

Until it continued on its previous track. Why? Because nothing had fundamentally changed. The company was still higly risky and had burned 900 million dollars on a 20 million revenue Q2 2020. The sentiment changed after Q3 2020 earnings, 6th November.

What I'm trying to point out here, it is the company that matters, not the stock price (unless we're dealing with something like Alphabet or Amazon), when people make investing decisions. If a reverse split on this will scare away some pennyscalpers and people with brokers that'll eat away their profits through split fee, so be it.

A reverse split changes absolutely nothing about the company itself.

I have seen a lot of people talk about reverse splits and how they're a negative thing and I've come to the conclusion it has to do something with lousy math education in the US and/or a society where appearances are more important than what's underneath.

If I have four quarters and exchange them for a dollar, how is that a negative? Please someone explain while I eat my crayons and lament that I might not own ~~42069~~ 52069 shares of HITI in the future.

*Edit: My actual number of holding is 10k higher than I said, so better be honest here. I intend to cut the number down by 10k at some point.

130,BC," It’s interesting to see this company pop up on this sub again. I personally hold about 50 shares of Dare right now for several reasons:
1. Their innovative product development (you’re 100% correct that a hormone free BC for women is a GAME CHANGER for all the reasons you listed plus the fact that women who have a genetic predisposition for breast/ovarian cancer cannot take traditional BC). 
2. THE COMPANY IS OWNED AND OPERATED BY WOMEN this is hugely important because until very recently women’s health issues have either been spearheaded by men or just lazily researched. (Up until the early 90s clinical trials weren’t even required to include women participants 🥴)
3. Having FDA fast track approval for the  DARE-BV1 cream is a big deal! The FDA only grants a few of those a year and only to products that impact a significant health risk in the population. For example, Johnson & Johnson got fast track approval for their covid vaccine because it only requires one dose instead of 2. And now it’s on the market. Being done with Phase 3 with positive outcomes means that DARE-BV1 is likely to be approved within the year assuming things continue to go well. 
4. As far as I know, Dare Bio is largely an R&D company, so they aren’t necessarily manufacturing and marketing their products (that I know of) but instead partner with other companies (Like Bayer) to use their production capabilities to bring Dare’s products to market. Someone please correct me if I’m wrong!!!

So, I personally see value in buying shares under $2. That being said, I really don’t agree with your statement about the Biden administration. I don’t think that will have any impact at all or if it does, it will be negligible. 
Also, I expect to see another bad quarter for earnings if I’m being honest. 
What have they done differently in Q4 of 2020? Nothing that I’m aware of. True, they have great stuff in the works, but until they get it to market they’re still pumping money into these trials with no return. 

I’m long on this stock and plan to stick around (I suuuuper love the idea of investing in a woman owned women’s health company) but I think it’s important to keep realistic expectations. When I first bought in shares were around 2.40-2.50 and I’ve averaged down to 2/share because I’ve watched it sink under $2 in the past few weeks.

1) Ovaprene. I'm not seeing the market for this. I can get behind the narrative of more options for women to take control of their reproductive cycle, however, realistically I don't see this becoming a popular option. There are already nonhormonal contraceptive options, namely copper IUDs. IUDs are already the most popular contraceptive option after the pill. I don't understand your dismissal of IUDs by simply saying ""IUDs are extremely painful."" Do some women have pain and complications associated with IUDs? Of course, and there are other options for exactly this reason, but the number of women comfortably enjoying the ""set it and forget it"" method of extremely effective contraception would disagree with your polarizing statement. I LOVE the product for the women who DO have issues with IUDs and hormonal options. I just think this demographic is exceedingly small. Stealing market share from women who do not have issues with other products is difficult. In general, it seems that those seeking birth control aren't too interested in trying new methods as evidenced by the 25% of women who still use birth control pills instead of the myriad other easier/safer/more effective options. 

2) Sildenafil cream. This is super cool. I like this product. I think there is a market for it and I can't believe it has taken this long to investigate solutions to FSAD. I would need to see clinical trial results to decide if it actually works, but this has legs. 

3) DARE BV-1. BV is pervasive and often recurs in the same patients over and over. If treatment is pursued by patients, they typically end up with oral antibiotics, sometimes multiple courses. This is associated with side effects which is minimized by local delivery of the drug instead. A vaginal gel in theory should limit systemic side effects of treatment. This could be a winner if they demonstrate at least on par efficacy/recurrence rates with better tolerability. Tolerability is very important in a treatment for a ""disease"" that is largely benign. Put simply, BV is more annoying than dangerous so the treatment needs to be significantly less annoying. I would imagine their trials and FDA application are designed as non-inferiority and they are banking on minimizing side effects. 

TLDR: I'm luke-warm on this. I think #2 has the most potential as the market is largely untapped to my understanding. #3 is alright. #1 I disagree with your optimism entirely :) We'll see what happens!",SpoogeMcDuck69,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/m3hmva/dare_and_the_month_of_march/gqpfk67/,0.075,0.771,0.155,0.9903

175,ASRT," EV - bit of a sell off yesterday taking this to a three month low.  Loading up.  Partnership news is coming within the next month, then we’re going lunar.  You’ve probably never heard of Erin Ventures and that’s okay too.

GMEV - despite a ton of upside, enough volatility to make 10% multiple times a day if you have time to watch the ticker.  Day off today so I will be all over this.  Also a great long term play; vertical agriculture is the future and can have a profound impact on the Cannabis industry.

ASRT - HOLD.  8 drugs in their portfolio; they are horribly undervalued.  March 15th Roth conference.  If there is a sell off today (likely) I may pick up a few more shares.

Plus they already have a distributor that works with all the large name brands to supply those companies with their new product. I’m looking at this from a long term macro perspective. 
From a fundamentals standpoint is just looks like a solid play to me. But maybe you can see something I don’t?

281,NOK," I just doubled my investment on the dip.

I think etfm has a lot of potential to break out from the pandemic funding. Theyve been acquiring companies and expanding their energy efficient clean ventilation systems portfolio.

It hasnt been talked about a ton, but the stimulus package has a significant amount of money going to states, cities, and local governments directly. Obviously a big issue is getting kids back to school, and CDC guidelines recommend improving ventilation systems or sterilization systems and FOMO Corp seems to be setting themselves up to capitalize on that need. 

There's a ton of schools and publicly accessible government buildings that want to reopen but need to do so with UV light purification systems or other means to limit their potential liability over the course of reopening / resuming normal life. Immunocompromised people arent necessarily going to be out of the woods immediately, so schools and public government buildings have a vested interest in facilitating a safe environment for everyone.

Not strictly etfm, but the absolutely insane amount of money being dumped into every level of government makes this a good time to hop into some infrastructure companies. Lumen might be a good purchase with the potential for additional funding to expand broadband networks (big issue and lots of states starting incentives so school students have better access), NOK probably good for 5g expansion projects, 

Any other companies that you can think of that are posed to make a buck from the increased infrastructure spending? Im sure the big guys like Verizon and Comcast are bound to get some deals out of this, but I'm not dumping my load on them lol",iFreakedIt,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/m3cw5n/daily_plays_march_12_2021/gqp9igu/,0.031,0.765,0.204,0.9944

If you hold this past the DFS (14 months) and JV (news apparently soon according to the CEO interview from after close today [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLiEgZT-nEw)); there's every chance this will take off in a large way. The Li3 deposits are massive, let alone all the other resources in the area and mines that PREM own already.

NB. A downside is the massive 20 billion shares that might be consolidated sometime in future, but I doubt (although you never know, the CEO has form for being a pain over the years) they would do this soon as to damage the momentum currently.

\*\*\* Per SEC Regulations, all officers of public companies are required to file SEC Forms when they sell shares.  But the CEO of KBLB (Kim Thompson) has NEVER filed SEC Forms when he has sold (or bought) shares.  Mr. Thompson has sold over 60 million shares over the years and has NEVER reported those sales.  


\*\*\* KBLB has toxic convertible debt.  They took out a $1 million loan from a Cayman Island firm on 11 Dec 2020.  They received $950K (an immediate $50K reduction) and are to pay back $1.23 million in cash (a $230K ""interest"" payment) by the end of the year.  And that is the BEST case.  If they don't pay in cash, then they will have to pay another 10% - 30% in stock.

\*\*\* The CEO (Kim Thompson) has paid himself exhorbitantly over the past 10+ years even though there has been basically no revenue during that entire time.  He gives himself $1/2 million per year, a 20% bonus EVERY YEAR, a 6% pay increase EVERY year, a $50K medical plan, a company car, etc.  All at shareholders expense.""

376,UK," Good call on the industry, less so on the company:

*While I am unaware of the record shortest time from* [*I*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering)*PO* *to bankruptcy, Britannia Bulk must certainly be in contention for this not-so-prestigious honour. The company raised $116m to float on the NYSE on 18th June 2008, but by 31st October 2008 had filed for administration in the UK courts.*

*Britannia Bulk* ***was a dry-shipping company*** *with a fleet of 22 vessels, including 13 drybulk vessels, five ice-class, five ocean-going ice-class barges, and four ice-class tugs.*
