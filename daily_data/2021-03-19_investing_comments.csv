These US based REM plays are going to continue to gain steam. Biden admin have set the precedent that they are going to continue to take China head on and aren't afraid to trade blows and assert dominance. IMO further deterioration of relations are highly likely.

Just today China said Tesla vehicles will no longer be allowed to drive in numerous areas around he country (military areas, around state owned enterprises, other critical agencies), due to the number of cameras and sensors. This kind of tit-for-tat is only going to continue.

8,MP," Other posts below have alluded to the issue with rare earths (REM) not being all that rare.  As you all likely know, China is the central hub for processing REM into a useable product.  The reason for this is that the refining process is a major source of pollutants, which doesn't bother China much.  As such, two questions come to my mind:

\-No question Biden recognizes that we have depended upon China in the past in ways that make the US vulnerable.  Will the government sponsor MP and/or other entrants into REM mining to reduce this weak spot?

\-Knowing that mining is only half the challenge, how do you think US regs will be relaxed (or where geographically) for the refining process?",Mommafed,1,/r/investing/comments/m89knw/mp_materials_posts_massive_earnings_beat_005/grixac0/,0.041,0.904,0.054,0.1583

19,DD," If you’re serious about investing a few 100k you need some kind of valuation for the company. Private company valuations are tricky compared to public ones (which have a market cap). There are a range of metrics you can use, like a list of comparable listed companies (don’t forget a discount for liquidity), multiples for comparable transactions (generally on an EBITDA basis but if it’s really fast growing revenue multiples can be used too, although it would make me pause), a discounted cashflow model (DCF) or the net asset position (very unusual for a growing business with low capex needs). These are all things a first year IB analyst could put together so do a bit of googling and you should at least have an idea of what to do to put together a base valuation. Alternatively pay someone a few grand to do it for you.

Once you know what the company would roughly be worth, you can confer with the director(s) who is willing to sell you part of his/her equity and whether they agree to sell x% at y valuation. 

You don’t necessarily need to do your own unique research on valuing the business (although it’d be smart to).

21,CVS," Just for reference as I'm a vet - 
This is 100% illegal for vets to do. My hospital was doing what you describe and our state medical board threatened to shut us down completely if we didn't change immediately. 

Basically - if you're prescribing a pet a medication and they want a prescription you NEED to give it to them. You take that prescription and upload it to chewy who then calls or messages me to confirm it. At that point, I as a vet am not ""re-prescribing"" it or anything. It's no different than when CVS or walgreens calls me to confirm a prescription. 

I have problems with my local CVS EVERY. DAY. The pharmacist declines pet prescriptions constantly for some reason (this is a known issue in my town) and I tell people not to go to that CVS or they risk having a big headache. It's on them if they listen. 

Same with chewy - I tell them ""hey, they're online portal was kind of a mess for the past few months [resolved now btw], so if I dont' get their confirmation email and they don't send your meds on time thats on you for wanting to go through them"". 

The biggest reason (not the only one but def the biggest) vets don't want stuff through chewy is financial. Because they have an outdated model that depends on price gouging clients on medications. 2 of the 3 hospitals I've worked at had extremely fair medication prices, *slightly* more than pharmacies which accounted for the fact that we get them at more expensive prices than CVS and Chewy. Those 2 hospitals had no issues with chewy. 

The 1 hospital w/ crazy high medication prices is the only one that had this issue with counterfeit meds from chewy - go figure. 

Sorry for the rant - I just hate when a hospital does crappy stuff cause it makes it all look bad and I don't want to be a part of that group",PoorVetKid,6,/r/investing/comments/m89ans/chewy_due_diligence_i_am_adding_more/grh6mvn/,0.109,0.869,0.022,-0.9816

2) One's business is built on actually making money, the other isn't profitable and wont be profitable in the next 5 years at a minimum.

3) They told you to ship it back because they lose money on any dog food over 20lbs, everyone does, including Amazon. That's why they dont want you to send it back.

4) It's not $400 loss for Chewys for one and it cost them less than 20% of that in product cost, shipping cost way more.

5) It's worth it to them to just give you the free food and a ""sorry card"" to placate complainers like yourself who will do more harm than the costs of the back. Better to just pat you on the head and say ""sowy bout dat! Here's a cookie!"" then you go complain on your twit and FB profile.

34,CC," I just ran into this strange limitation with Fidelity. Hoping someone will help me make sense of this  


Own 100 shares of underlying, along with two long puts, one of which Fidelity decided was a 'protective put' on the shares. The put is deep ITM and strike date is several weeks out. 

These days the margin requirement for that stock is 100%, which would be \~$19k today, but due to the protective put it is currently only $2500 in my account. 

Today I wanted to sell a 3/19 OTM covered call on those 100 shares, but was restricted by Fidelity. When I called and asked it was explained that doing so would drive up the margin requirement, because the shares would no long be paired with the put, but instead the call, and the margin requirement would shoot up to $19k.

Customer support couldn't explain why this would happen, however, and it still doesn't make sense to me. It seems like a technical issue rather than a risk mitigation one, because Fidelity's software doesn't seem to recognize the collar option strategy - as soon as the CC is sold, it stops recognizing the protection offered by the put that I still very much own.

Running through the two possible scenarios here, I don't see how Fidelity's risk changes in any way for the margin requirement to shoot up:  


1. CC expires OTM - I pocket the premiums, the protective put is still in place, nothing changes
2. CC expires ITM - I sell the shares, have a bunch of cash in the account, and now own just a long put with 0 margin requirement.

I bought VBTLX @ $11.67 per share (RIP) because I wanted 50% in stocks and 50% in bonds to mitigate risk. That was my nooby mistake since rates are so low and now people aren't worried of economic collapse with the COVID vaccine coming out so VBTLX is losing value every day. I am down $565 on this fund which is really disappointing. I haven't sold yet because I believe you only lose money in the market if you sell low.. So I'm holding until I break even from dividends or rates go back up or whatever. That's 2-3 years from now which is really annoying so this money is pretty much locked up.

I have $4k that I want to invest somewhere and I was thinking either putting it in VFFVX, VFIAX, or VMFXX. I like money market funds because you get a free $20 each month or whatever if you have $10k invested and it never goes down because $1 always equals $1.

42,TD," Please be patient with me.
I use the TD AMERITRADE app. Need help with writing options/covered calls. This will be an easy one for you guys, especially if you have experience with TD. For me? Not so much. I have done lots of reading, but still not sure. I am more of a visual learner and YouTube has helped a little. 

Situatuon:
I have 100 shares of a stock. I'd like to do a covered call on it and make a premium while I hold it. I mean, why not?!?
If the stock soars to the moon in/during the process, that's fine, I will still make money if it hits the strike, plus I get my premium. I don't care if I miss out on the big gains. If it hits the strike/ I get called, oh well, I can let the stocks go. After all, I was paid my premium and I made gains UP to the strike price. That's quite alright with me.
Also, I don't want to be obligated to buy anything back or do another transaction or this or that, I just want to collect a damn premium. If the option expires, cool, I will just make another contract, rinse/repeat. If it's called, cool, I'll let it go. 

Now, TD has 4 choices in the covered call section:

1. Buy to open

2. Buy to close

3. Sell to open

4. Sell to close. 

Considering what I wrote above, I think I need to select ""SELL TO OPEN"" to write the call option, right? Can anyone confirm that? 
***Also, in TD app (review order page), since I own the stock, should the shares be  "" -0 "" and the contract will be  "" +1 ""?

If option expires, do I need to do anything else by clicking one of the above choices? How about it is called, will I have to click anything additional?

Thank you all.",Whitegaragedoor111,1,/r/investing/comments/m8d3os/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/griyaau/,0.048,0.826,0.125,0.9743
43,LOVE," Hey, sincerely here for ten seconds,

Learn about and understand compound interest. Run projections on any number of online compound interest calculators.
I.E. You contribute $1200($100 month) a year for three years. Than $2400($200 month) for seven years. Then $12,000 for 10 years. Then $24,000 for 5 years.

See where that puts you with compound interest at a boring 3% annual return. A somewhat predictable 6-7% return. And a 10% return.

Then, I'm not sure what age you can get a Roth IRA. But get one as soon as you can. Every dollar you put in that, that you take out later, is tax free. If it's 5 million, that's 5, million tax free.
There is a limit to how much you can contribute annually, and rules around when you can pull it out. However, it is a very good thing to at least understand as an option.

Then, when you're bored with that compound interest calculator. Punch in random shit. What if you mow lawns/shovel driveways for $50 a month? Stick that in an index fund, and don't touch it for 30 years?

I wish I learned about compound interest in school, because when I discovered it in my early/mid-twenties I found out I LOVE applied financial math. Closing on 30 now and thinking about going back to school for finance.",TechnicianPlenty,4,/r/investing/comments/m8d3os/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/grhn0ze/,0.042,0.802,0.156,0.9803
44,TD," If you are considering a longer term approach to investing, you may want to look at the technology platform(s) available at the brokerage.  

* What investor education is offered by the brokerage?  
* Will the platform handle options, margin, commodities, ForEx, ... ?  
* Does the platform produce the real-time charts you want?  
* What are the free research reports available to account holders? 

As a new investor, you may not know all of the answers but you can research the reviews to get a good start.  I will suggest that TD Ameritrade may be worth researching.",Sheeple0123,1,/r/investing/comments/m8d3os/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/grhojyn/,0.0,0.877,0.123,0.8628
45,GME," You can't take your gains without exiting your position to some degree; hence why this is sophisticated gambling.

Say you bought 100 shares of GME for $10. The price is now $100. Your $1000 investment is now worth $10,000.

Option A: Sell ten shares(your original $1000), and keep the rest because you believe it will go higher.

Option B: Sell it all. 1,000% increases are really rare. You now have $10,000: $9,000 in profit. If the stock goes down, you sold at the peak. If the stock goes up and you get FOMO: you made profit. Don't get caught up in ""what ifs"", you'll make bad trades doing emotional what ifs.

Option C: You've sold small amounts throughout the rise to $100. Your profit is ~$6,000. Not as high as it could be. BUT, you insulated yourself from sudden drops or shocks.

If you try to buy the bottom of dips, and sell the peaks, you WILL lose money in the long run. That's emotional trading and it doesn't end well. Go take a look at WSB loss porn if this option seems tempting.

Trading OPTIONS is a whole other ballgame. It's making the risk higher for higher potential rewards. The basic option plays are

* Options basics. Options are always for 100 shares. Strike: the price you can buy/sell stock for. Premium: the money it will cost to have that option. Breakeven: your strike and premium added for where you start to make money. Expiration: the end of this day(normal market hours only) that option will disappear if you didn't sell it/excersize it: worthless. That money is gone forever.

* My option is worth money: what do I do.  You can excersize an option to buy/sell the shares. However, you almost always want to sell the option instead. Options have intrinsic value(it's worth this $$$ today) and extrinsic: the potential the option has with the time left. Extrinsic can shrink rapidly as expiration gets closer, don't dismiss it.

* Call: ""I'm calling it"". You think the stock will go up. Depending on your strike and premium, if the stock is going up your option is likely becoming worth more.

*Put: ""I'm putting it down"". You think the stock will go down.

There are much more complicated option plays. And some relatively simple. Like the straddle where you buy a put and a call because you think the stock will swing hard, but you don't know what way.

Again: options are high risk-high reward. You can make lots of money, or lose it all VERY VERY fast.
If you buy 100 shares of GME at $100 and it drops to $2; you can hold onto those shares as long as you want hoping it goes up. You buy options expiring in two months for GME; and within that two months it never passes your breakeven: that money is rapidly disappearing.

Managed funds; with multiple people who have spent their whole careers learning the market, rarely outperform index funds over a 10 year period.
Investing outside bonds/index funds/mutual funds/CDs/etc has considerable risk. Invest in boring shit for retirement, if you have money left over think hard about if you want to gamble it in the market.

Say you're a genius, killing it with options, you turn $25k into $400k. Then something like 2008 happens and that money might be worth $3k.
You can't predict the market, none of us can. It's all educated guesses and crossed fingers. Anyone who tells you different is selling you something.",TechnicianPlenty,2,/r/investing/comments/m8d3os/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/grhj0hl/,0.068,0.848,0.085,0.572

Invest only what you have to lose so you aren't worried if your money is up or down 5%.

You can keep up with your stock, lower your dollar cost average buying a dip or get more shares as it rises, but you don't want to micro manage your portfolio.

There are times you should sell a stock. It rises so fast that it will not be sustainable. For example, even if you were long on GME. You got in at $17 you sell when it hits 480 and wait for it to go down to a reasonable price. Won't be that extreme, but there are companies that do this often. They get ahead of themselves. 

Another time you sell is when something changes the thesis you had. Every stock won't be NFLX or AMZN where it goes up and comes back down to eventually go up very high. But you should only exit positions when you no longer believe in the company or something major happens.

For example, JPM was on sale a couple of months ago and then PG was last month and VZ and ABBV are now.  So for me I feel like it makes sense to buy the individual stocks on sale rather than buying the ETF at ATH.  Then again, you can also make the argument ""it's a solid investment because it's at ATH while many individual holdings are not.""

I guess it depends where you are on your journey as well.  At this point I have alot of gains so am not going to die if I have some red (knock on wood).  But if it's one of your first investments you need to pick more carefully.
