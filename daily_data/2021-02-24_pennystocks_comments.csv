Red is proven to make humans play more aggressively and also panic whereas blue makes us play more conservatively and rationally.

Sometimes a sell off can be healthy for the growth of a stock. It can get rid of those short term grifters and make a price more *fair* regarding the overall sentiment of the market.

Cannabis revenue in general is on an upward trend and will continue to go up as legalization efforts move forward.... there's untapped potential anywhere in North America that doesn't have recreationally legal cannabis currently.

IAQ will be the best defense against this.

He said we have a video partner and a PR firm ready to go.

for anyone comparing them to ALPP,  ALPP has a market cap of 792 million. ETFM's is 76.2 million. if ETFM traded at 16 cents, 10x the current ETFM/pps, they would basically have the same MC as ALPP. think about that.

So, the dollars are in reserve accounts in the banks that make these transactions, those accounts generally are in the NY Fed. 

When the Fed prints, 80% is digital and goes to these accounts. From there it’s “spent” into the economy. This restriction of who gets these funds is how the inflation is hidden and slowly released.

87,AI," What you are referring to is the concept I have called non-indexed inflation, but I am not sure that is an official term.  Think I stole the name from an old Econ professor.  Inflation that is not picked up in the CPI or PCE index.  Yachts and sports teams are not included in the ""basket of goods"" that are used to calculate the inflation rate, so they never get indexed.   But, I don't think it can be narrowed down to just that one thing that is preventing what would otherwise appear to be inevitable hyper-inflation resulting from years of quantitative easing.  Another major factor fighting against inflation are massive increases in productivity. We are seeing increases in worker productivity, automatic, AI, resource utilization and so on. Now with the pandemic and a number of people working from home, we are going to see deflationary pressure on commercial real estate.  The cost of offices and store fronts will start adding downward pressure also, mainly because we are more efficiently using existing many residential spaces for commercial uses.  So all this productivity is another counterforce against inflation.  

So overall, I think another answer to your question is that we are not seeing hyper-inflation because of counter inflationary pressures to go along with the non-indexed inflation that you mentioned.",SnidelyWhiplash1,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/lrjs0n/where_is_the_inflation/gomj448/,0.069,0.896,0.035,-0.7546

In addition to the plans described above for our NoveCite i-MSCs Program, we plan to submit an IND to the FDA and initiate our Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial in COVID-19 ARDS by the end of the second quarter of 2022. Our recent $20 million private round of financing and investors' exercise of warrants for net proceeds of approximately $4.5 millionprovides significant financial runway to move forward with our three programs in the clinic, as well as manufacturing development for our unique induced-mesenchymal stem cell therapy for ARDS associated with COVID-19.

294,TD," \>  What broker should I use for OTC pennystocks  


I am currently using etoro, which is very basic, cant trade pennystocks or options and was down for the most part of yesterday. I applied for a TD Ameritrade account on the 8th Feb, but still no progress even though they say on the site it takes 2-3 days. So I am wondering if they are not taking new accounts or something is up because I am not a US resident. I looked into Fidelity and TradeStation, but it appears those platforms are for US residents only.  


Can anyone please recommend a viable platform for pennystocks that accepts non-US residents?",maximag,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/lr3lg1/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gokfp17/,0.025,0.859,0.116,0.8765

There are many legit pharma companies that are already making great progress with Ketamine. Take [NeuroRX](https://www.neurorxpharma.com/) ($BRPA) for example.

Someone posted about this the other day on shroomstocks sub too. Just search for BRPA in shroomstocks.

That said, I'm not suggesting people buy $BRPA as a psychedelic play right now as the price is being driven by their COVID-19 drug Aviptadil and can easily pump/dump 50% in a day depending on how their phase 3 trial data looks for that drug.",lifofifo,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/lrfhvf/numi_lkysf_numinus_wellness_undervalued_market/gomdpfo/,0.0,0.812,0.187,0.9719

Furthermore Colima Mexico is listed as don't not travel from the US state department because its murder rate is almost 1:1,000 and is a hot bed for cartel activity. This is likely why they don't say where their gold mine is. At best it is inviting cartel involvement at worse increasing cost of protesting their assets. 

Core State Holdings has a product that has been out for years. Yes an employee left that is listed on their website as being a co-founder. Another employee has the same name as someone they want to/have purchased real estate from. They announced the building of a headquarters in March last year that may not have started work, assuming google maps is up to date. Another person on their website is listed as an advisor and doesn't appear to directly work for them, again not a mystery, she is probably a consultant.

OTC does indeed stand for ""Over the Counter,"" and is a reference to the market that these stocks trade on.  OTCmarket is a place where stocks that do not qualify for the major listings can be bought and sold.  NASDAQ, where the heavy hitting major players are traded, is heavily regulated and requires the stock to sell at a certain minimum price, I believe $1 or more, though I've heard there are some categories of stock that are required to hit $2 or even $4 before ""uplisting,"" or being added to the NASDAQ market.

So, since penny stocks are those stocks trading at about $5 or less, you can see that some will be listed on NASDAQ, and more will not.  This subreddit will discuss stocks from $.00001 to about $5, and the lower end of that will be on OTC, while those whocare consistently above $1 could be foundon NASDAQ.

Many brokers, such as Robinhood, Webull, and the like will not allow you to trade stocks from the less regulated OTC.  You need an account with a broker that allows trades like these.  I've heard that Etrade and TD Ameritrade allow this.  But my personal favorite is Schwab.  They don't charge fees for trading OTC stocks unlike Etrade.  

If you use a company like the three mentioned above, depositing money will not be instantaneous as it was on RH or Webull.  Deposits in schwab typically take 2 days to clear and have an addition hold (about 3 business days in my experience).  So you can expect your deposited money to be able to be used about 1 week after deposit.  This is in part to protect you, the novice investor, from making very costly mistakes that you don't have the money to pay for.  RH doesn't have the same protections, or at least they're less obvious.   


The OTC is full of scam companies, disingenuous PR, liars, opportunists, and just bad investments.  Sifting through these to find good companies is part of the fun, the rush and also the main risk of this game, so take the time to go through this subreddits about section and learn about all facets of penny trading, and trading in general.  Learn how to read about company financials and how to identify pump and dump scams so you can either avoid them or ride the wave safely.  You can definitely ask questions, though I've found that any question you may have is probably answered already in the sub, or in the about section.  


Good luck!  I hope my non-advice is helpful.",Star_x_Child,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/lrcz1t/bdgr_is_just_getting_started_worth_reading/golqq0v/,0.084,0.794,0.122,0.964

556,DD," OP, best advice....Stop Reading Twitter and Reddit.  So many posts out there of guys bragging that they deposited $4 in their account and made 8 Billion....sorry, if you see someone brag about it, they are a pumper.

Trading is not a Get Rich Quick scheme, its a grind and takes lot of time.  Stocks dont run from .0001 to $1 overnight.   Follow trends, do some DD, buy a few and stick them out.  Jumping from one to another to chase the pump will not make you any money.",MercTheJerk1,9,/r/pennystocks/comments/lqv653/so_as_someone_who_doesnt_have_diamond_hands_or_a/goivjqu/,0.033,0.919,0.048,0.3129
557,GOOD," Go to Investopedia.  Read the site daily.  Just read, don't do anything. Learn about market and limit trades, stop losses and all the rest.  Do NOT play with options yet, as the saying goes babies who play with sharp things get hurt.  Options are dangerous unless you know what you're doing and you don't know nuthin.

(Side note, try to get rid of your debt as much as you can, especially credit card debt because that 25% interest rate will wipe out any gains you could possibly make on penny stocks or otherwise and will hose any dreams of a house.)

Once that's done or well on its way, open a GOOD brokerage account. Fidelity is the best, TDAmeritrade or Schwab are fine too.  Do not bother with Robinhood or any other two-bit operation as tempting and fun as they can be. Those are low-rent casinos for bored housewives like me on the side of our family accounts. Besides, you can't buy OTC Pink/penny stocks on there anyway.

Build up cash in the account, resist the urge to put $100 immediately into the Reddit Flavor of the Week because you'll just cry and wish you'd bought weed and pizza instead.  Get a good chunk of money in there and spend the time researching.  Get a paper account (trading simulator) and plug in recommendations, see how they do before you put any money in anything.  Learn from your mistakes for free and continue to build up your cash reserve in your actual account *with only money you can afford to never see again.*

Once you've decided to jump in, pick one stock and buy a small amount.  Then, watch how it plays out without doing anything over a good period of time.  You will learn more by leaving it alone watching it through its natural life span than you will fiddling with it constantly.  Of course, if it goes 25% plus at any point, sell it, enjoy your good luck and don't expect that to happen every time.

Once you've done all these things, you are ready to start your investing life, slowly, learning and researching constantly, taking your time and adhering to the best adage *""The stock market is the story of the patient profiting from the impatient.""*

Good luck!  Of course, you can ignore all of this and YOLO it and I still wish you luck. May the TendieMan rain down upon you either way.",dbkate,7,/r/pennystocks/comments/lqv653/so_as_someone_who_doesnt_have_diamond_hands_or_a/goiyskr/,0.069,0.761,0.17,0.9929
