Also Covid related because people probably got nervous getting items from other countries. 3. Because of changes WISH made. Like the subscription fees. I haven’t bought anything since they did that. I didn’t like the change. With that said things could get better for them in the future. I have purchased a few items from them and I wasn’t disappointed in anything I bought.

Hmm think you’re right I didn’t really dig into it much but after taking a proper look;

“The Management Incentive Plan is intended to (i) incentivize Mr. Garipalli and Mr. Toy with long-term equity-based compensation to align their interests with our shareholders and (ii) promote the success of our business. The Management Incentive Plan only permits the grant of RSUs to Mr. Garipalli and Mr. Toy in the amounts and pursuant to the terms as described below. Subject to adjustments as set forth in the Management Incentive Plan, the maximum aggregate number of shares of our Class B Common Stock that may be issued under the Management Incentive Plan is 33,426,983. The shares may be authorized, but unissued, or reacquired Class B Common Stock.” 

So that’s a lot of money they will get from those shares if they execute in the next 5 years. Guess that’s good sign at least…",freshasparagus_,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3n6nk/just_a_reminder_to_you_tists/h8tuwcl/,0.007,0.769,0.225,0.9904

PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: Nailing The Palantir Price Action
Mentioned:	PLTR
Benzinga's PreMarket Prep airs every morning from 8-9 a.m. ET. During that fast-paced, highly informative hour, traders and investors tune in to get the major news of the day, the catalysts behind those moves and the corresponding price action for the upcoming session.

On any given day, the show will cover at least 20 stocks determined by co-hosts Joel Elconin and Dennis Dick along with producer Spencer Israel.

Different factors go into interpreting the price action, up or down, in an issue following an earnings report. One of those factors is the open interest in the weekly (or longer-term) options markets.

On Thursday's show, this dynamic was discussed with respect to Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR), the PreMarket Prep Stock of the Day.

Palantir Price Action Ahead Of Earnings: On May 11, Palantir put in a major bottom at $17.06 and embarked on a substantial rally. That move came to an abrupt end when it put in a pair of highs at the $27.50 area at the end of June.

The retreat off that high came on July 19, when it bottomed at $20.55. Ahead of the report, it has been in a nine-day trading range from $21.69 to $23.52 and spent a majority of those sessions chopping around in the $22 handle.

In Wednesday's session, it had a range of $22.09-$23.19 and settled to closer near the low at $22.35.

Palantir's Q2 Report: Before open, the company reported quarterly earnings of 4 cents per share, which beat the analyst consensus estimate of 3 cents by 33.33%. The company reported quarterly sales of $376 million, which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $353.23 million by 6.45%.

Palantir forecast third-quarter sales $385 million vs. a $376.4-million estimate and raised FY21 adjusted free cash flow guidance from $150 million to $300 million.

Potential Impact Of Palantir Options Trading: When the issue was being discussed on the show, it was trading higher by over $2 at the $24.70 area.

By looking at the huge open interest in the $25 weekly calls (and longer) dated in the options chain, Dennis Dick, explained in great detail how that open interest may have an impact on the price action in the issue.

'The millions of shares controlled by the owners of the options,"" Dick said, ""will affect the price action as they attempt to work out of their positions.'

The author of this article noticed potential resistance at the pair of highs from early July at the $25.30 level as a potential target for the upcoming session.

The full discussion on the issue from Thursday's show can be found here:

PLTR Price Action: After a mich higher open ($24.45 vs. $22.35), Palantir peaked at about $24.70 Thursday and had a brief decline to $23.88 before resuming its moved higher. It went on to breach the $25 level and aforementioned highs at the $25.30 level, rallying to $25.76 and reversing course.

The reason for that may have been owners of the large amount of $25 calls were attempting to lock in profits and have a hedged position as opposed to exiting the option outright.",Fit-Ad-7382,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p393tc/predictions_on_tomorrows_pltr_let_the_games_begin/h8pk7qu/,0.022,0.909,0.069,0.9723

I like going for the companies that are underperforming their competition with good financials and a small float that can have leadership easily overhauled at the first sign of trouble.

There are some lines of thinking where US legalization could be bad for SNDL.

983,IMO," It will get legalized federally within 7 years. There’s too much of a current rift with states that have legalized it to delay that long. It’s like Gay marriage at this point. You can’t have a functioning country if you can legally buy weed on one state under state laws, but simultaneously be violating federal laws. It’s a goddamn compliance nightmare. 

I do think the climate supports legalization IMO. GOP actually has >50% support from constituents on legal weed, and Dems/progressives are closer to 80+%. 

You are 100% correct that there isn’t much focus on it right now at the federal level. Infrastructure and reconciliation are sucking all the air out of the room, but there is some traction building:

A few weeks ago, Sen. Schumer introduced a draft bill, called the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act, that would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act and begin regulating and taxing it. Though states would still be allowed to set their own marijuana laws, businesses and individuals in states that have legalized its use would be free for the first time to sell and consume without the risk of federal punishment. (The House passed similar legislation back in December, with a handful of Republicans joining to vote in favor).

I don’t think we are 7 years away from something like this passing. It’s already getting sponsored and proposed. I think the votes are there. And we will see a ton of states putting legalizing weed on their state ballots for 2022 election cycle.",Chippopotanuse,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3f9nx/easy_4_apes_sndl_analysis/h8s5h8p/,0.055,0.851,0.094,0.8059

Their equipment would go for pennies on the dollar(not the original purchase price that’s accounted for on the balance sheet) and their Reggie ass weed would be thrown away(not sold for the “current assets” values you see on the balance sheet).

1102,DD," It’s oversold.  I think it will rebound.  I bought some $95 strike calls that expire in Jan 2023 - some earlier this week and some today.  100 contracts i.e. 10,000 shares - if you care about the numbers.  Cost me 31K.  My thesis is that Dems will pass the marijuana bill that was introduced earlier this year either by the end of the year or early next year.  That will be the catalyst.

1136,TSLA," Ok. Time for a completely baseless yet entertaining narrative of TSLA price action today because why the fuck not:

The upper edge of options expected move for this week is 730. Now obviously we hit that and it got SMACKED down. 👋 

My completely uninformed guess from looking at the additional 44K 730 calls bought this morning was that both retail and institutions tried to EPICLY gamma squeeze the market makers. 

But the market makers were too smart for them. They’ve been buying shares all week to hedge their delta risk. They knew if they dumped almost 1M at once, they could shift the upward momentum and so they did. 

However, they may have played their 🚨emergency🚨 hand and are now left with a gamma deficit. 

Now for the fun part. If I were a betting man (which I clearly am or I wouldn’t be here amongst the most degenerate of degenerates 🤌🤌), I would say there will be a 2nd attempt when volume picks back up again around 2:30 and this time, they stand a chance of breaking the upper edge which would cause a massive gamma squeeze up due to MM’s having to hedge their risk.

A Retard.",RADIO02118,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3jotz/fraternal_association_of_gambling_gentlemen_and/h8sj8zg/,0.086,0.771,0.143,0.9158

Recent dividend DDs have just been bait and switches for inexperienced traders.  The person writing the DD already has a position they are looking to dump, and the higher they can get the price before ex date the better.

1188,PT," I wrote my thoughts elsewhere, but re-posting here for awareness regarding his recent earnings call.

The entire earnings call was fluff. It was full of Henrik overpromising things in his typical fashion. He started off even dissing Canoo by saying ""we're not making minivans and we're not making delivery trucks."" Very little was discussed regarding how much progress Fisker and/or Magna has made to actually manufacture the Fisker Ocean (e.g. building prototypes, crash testing, road testing and etc).

It was interesting that Fisker was a PIPE subscriber ($10m) to European EV charging network Allego. At first, it seemed like a strategic move as the deal would give European customers 1 year of free charging. However, he later stated that he only expects 25% of Fisker Oceans to be sold in Europe. I suspect that this investment is just a talking piece, so he could claim Fisker has their own *exclusive* charging network, like Tesla.

He also talked about Project PEAR with ""geography is on our side ... PEAR in Asia"" and then touts how the PEAR would be $22,5000 after the $7,500 federal tax credit. Yet, if these vehicles were to be sold to an Asian market, they would not receive the American $7,500 tax credit.

What I still don't understand is why he established a relationship with Foxconn, after giving 6% equity to Magna? You would think granting that huge chunk of equity would result in more than just one vehicle to be produced.

Sean O'Kane from The Verge actually caught Fisker in an outright lie.

>Fisker recently said it's accelerating the EV project w/ Foxconn, but in its quarterly filing posted today w/ the SEC, the timeline on selecting a facility remains vague.In March, Foxconn said it would decide by July 1st.

[https://twitter.com/sokane1/status/1425551271705124874](https://twitter.com/sokane1/status/1425551271705124874)

Fisker also made some other tall claims.

>I also think we're going to achieve potentially the longest range in the size and class of price as a vehicle we're in. That's something that I'm fairly confident then.

&#x200B;

>The ability to actually execute two vehicle platforms, two different vehicle platforms, in this stage as a startup companies is quite unique. I think it really validates our strategy. I don't think there's any startup ever, even EV U.S. startup that actually have developed or started to develop two platforms simultaneously, despite probably having some of them having raised more billions of dollars than we have.

Fisker was able to execute the perfect hat-trick. He had his earnings call. Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley comes out with a ridiculous $90 PT to pump the stock. Days later, Fisker announces $600m convertible bond offering. You would think he'd mention something so important on the earnings call that he held just days before, no? Also, whatever happened to the ""asset light"" model?
