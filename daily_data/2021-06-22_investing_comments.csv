That's just a list off the top of my head of the ones I know and have seen personally.  They also produce a HUGE number of mediocre films with unknown actors that look strangely similar to well known A- and B-list actors, and low-budget films with 1-2 well known but not-so-talented actors.  It's both a numbers game and a value game, and they seem to have the formula down for low-budget value films that are ""just good enough to watch""",ForrestNub,1,/r/investing/comments/o5prri/steven_spielberg_signs_deal_with_netflix_nflx_in/h2p5k23/,0.036,0.784,0.18,0.9302
3,NFLX," Yep. I feel NFLX takes a spray and pray approach with original content. I think they're hoping that they'll get lucky with a few strong hits due to the large number of bets. They also talk about collecting data from these numerous experiments to help guide future investments into original content. Yet, I'm not convinced that's the right approach.

In contrast, HBO seems to take a different approach. They have strongly opinionated experts that make judgement calls about what to fund. While they produce a smaller volume of content, they have a much higher success rate in producing major hits.

Beyond wasting money on original content, I'm also concerned that NFLX's approach is going to degrade the NFLX originals brand. Personally, I already ignore most suggested NFLX originals until I hear that the show or movie is worth checking out. As more consumers adopt this mindset, they will have reduced engagement w/ NFLX. Long term, this would lead to higher churn.",hagy,8,/r/investing/comments/o5prri/steven_spielberg_signs_deal_with_netflix_nflx_in/h2p06q8/,0.057,0.738,0.205,0.9706

7,DIS," They are also getting into merchandising, which in hindsight is a no brainer.  A lot of people share Netflix accounts which they can cut down on.  Netflix has been pretty sticky - people continue to keep Netflix despite price increases.

I wonder if once Netflix get a large enough library of their own licenses, they can cut down on their cash burn and become more cashflow positive.  I don't know if this is true- but streaming metrics show that Office, Friends, etc continue to be some of the highest viewed shows which tells me ppl like repetition and nostalgia.

They also are one of the best run businesses so I wouldn't discount management to adapt in the face of growing competition.

Mostly because they are responsible for it, but i digress.

Bespoke collateralized debt obligations have become the mainstay with sub prime loans as their bread and butter again, only this time in more countries than before (thanks Greensill, RBC, BoA, and Citadel!).

We have done nothing but kick the can from 2008 and covid has forced the hand of the government to look at wall street, because if they don't fix the leaky taps that is the corruption on Wall Street, the oncoming mass eviction on the 30th of this month of 8 million people could turn into maybe 12 million people, will be a flood we do not recover from.

23,GME," I was watching tasty trade, and they brought up an excellent point that although the VIX is fairly low for an impending crash, the SKEW index is sky high, which implies that most of the market risk exists within outlier cases such as GME and digital currency stocks.

This implies that actually the thing that will crash and captures the most risk is not actually the market, but rather the risky bets within the market, and that there is very little connection to the market as a whole if those asset classes were to crash

That deal was gone within a week on a ""All Cash Deal"" as per the broker.

Cut now to a year later, August 2021, for similar high rise condos, 2 B 2B in NYC, similar neighbourhoods are listed starting at $2 million. For a condensed market, NYC brokers have inventories, but are very shrewd in terms of how they open them up for sale, let alone for whom to sell to (Cash/Mortgage).

Ofcourse the pandemic was an exception to the case to have the prices drop for a bit, but I agree to the point that Inflation adjusted the prices have always gone up.",bombayalgotrader,7,/r/investing/comments/o5eahr/house_prices_inflation_and_interest_rates/h2mf45g/,0.04,0.904,0.056,0.4215
37,AC," One thing that gets overlooked is the replacement of condos with ""luxury"" apartments.  That is, what I am seeing on the ground, is that new development seems to be focused on apartments that rent in the $2500 - $3500 range in large complexes, rather than condominiums that sell in the $400k - $600k range.  And there's a lot of this high-priced apartment building going on.

Why?  Because interest rates are low, sure, but also because those ""luxury"" apartments can be built like total crap and it doesn't matter.  The cheap laminate flooring looks like real hardwood; the ""granite"" countertops a quarter inch thick are cheap.  Gas ranges are replaced with cheap electric ranges with a flat top and nothing to clean (looks clean even if crappy to cook on).  The walls are paper thin, built with the most substandard crap imaginable.  Trim is replaced with clean beige walls, etc.  Every corner that can be cut is cut - and they're still renting.

Why?  Because a condo is expensive to build.  It's hard to get the space together for a parking lot, and if you use a carport, at least where I live in MA, you need an expensive dry sprinkler system for the carport.  

Old victorians are still being converted into multi-family condos, but those old homes, while charming to look at from the street, are sometimes crap to live in (i.e., being spread out over three floors, weird-sized rooms, etc.).

Eventually, I would think that the big apartment complexes would be turned into condos, but the build quality is so poor, I don't see how that can happen while supporting the high price they draw as rentals.  People will rent anything, and sometimes it's companies renting it for employees sight unseen.  Putting in a ""gym"" and a ""concierge"" allows one to call it ""luxury"", but those big complexes are really just crap apartments with working AC - a big step up from converted pre-War buildings in the city center, but definitely not worth $3k/month. 

Still, because so much capital has gone into rentals and so little into condos or SFHs, there is a dearth of decent condominium housing that people can own, so they are forced into overpriced rentals.

39,OR," I live in one of the hottest markets in the country (Portland OR metro). Many friends have been selling lately to move out or upsize/downsize, and in every single case, the bank appraisal came in less than the offer, and in every single case the buyer had cash to make the difference. And those are just the offers that were financed, many others are just straight cash.

This is why I firmly do not believe this is a 2008 repeat, this is not people getting shitty loans that they can't afford. The money is there, and the money wants to buy. Even when the banks pump the brakes, the cash comes out to make it up. 

Asking price is just a number and honestly doesn't matter much to me. Selling price is the true value, the difference is just gamesmanship.

Depends how big the gold bar is and yes, you can rent it to someone.

>Are there tax benefits to owning gold?

All the gains are capital gains. Some of the most favourably taxed gains after the sale of a PPOR and small business sale concessions.

47,JNJ," Not really 'seasoned' since I'm in my early thirty's but I have been investing since my early 20s and I'm closer in age to you then we are to the older investors.  Here are a few thoughts for you.

If your new to investing and want to pick individual companies, do not put large amounts into them for a few years.  Its really easy to invest a large sum of money, see the price go down, freak out and sell, and then buy back into them after the price has gone back up and your nerves calm back down.  Its really easy to end up with less money then you started with.

&#x200B;

Get a ROTH IRA (I believe that you have to have taxable income to open one), and an HSA if your company's health plan allows for it (you have to have a high deductible).  These are tax advantaged but there are limits on how much money you can put into them in a year.

&#x200B;

I would probably continue to do more or less the same thing that I'm doing now.  Looking for long term (5 years or more) growth companies that have high year over year sales growth.  These are usually small cap, but there are large cap companies that have this as well.  A lot of them are in the tech sector, but I don't necessarily think the sector classifications are all that accurate anymore.  I try and look at the problems that I expect to come up in 5+ years and look in those areas.  A single area might be Cybersecurity, but an ETF might be better since its probably impossible to pick the winning company.  


The other ones that I would do are some of the 'bluechip' companies with long histories of dividend growth, JNJ is the one that comes to mind.  They aren't really glamorous, but they are usually well managed companies that have products that people need, know how to churn a profit, and do fine during a downturn.   The dividend aristocrats list

49,AAPL," It's not useful to suggest going back to buy things that we now realize were piles of money in waiting. OP wants universally applicable, general wisdom based on our collective experience.

If I had $50,000 at age 22, I would put that initial money into a boring S&P or total U.S market index fund.  Maybe shave $10k for an international index, but that's because I wouldn't know at the time that U.S. has consistently outpaced int'l over the years.  So really, just the U.S index.  And I'd set up monthly automatic additions to water this seedling in perpetuity.

We can all do facepalms over the things we didn't buy or shouldn't have sold.  But those are not repeatable events.  AAPL is a great stock, but its days of multi-hundred percent gains are *probably* over... not definitely, but probably.  I have it since 2010 with a 2,000% gain.  But I sold 50 shares in the 90s as well, what a dope.

Other advice would be to max out every tax-advantaged option you have, don't just call it 10% and say that's good enough.  And don't spend your bonuses and raises on fluff every year.  Basically, shove more money away and you'll be able to retire earlier.  I was able to do so at age 54, but that's because I stumbled my way in rather than working proactively towards it.  Might have been able to exit 10 years earlier with better planning.",McKnuckle_Brewery,3,/r/investing/comments/o55sbg/if_you_could_go_back_to_being_a_22yr_old_college/h2nl19t/,0.04,0.848,0.112,0.9665

They may not beat the market, but I'd be shocked to see any of them disappear anytime soon. And if they did, it would almost certainly correlate with widespread losses in the broader market.

82,AAPL," My thoughts on MSFT, AAPL, JPM, and DIS.  


I favor stocks like these because they are titans of the industry and will grow for the foreseeable future, but I want to buy them at real discounts, not perceived value-discounts (trying to determine intrinsic value, or future earnings, etc.) Stocks don't trade that way. And no matter how good a company is, it can be a bad stock.

I still see both MSFT and AAPL as knocking on a ceiling. Both will be future buying opportunities soon.  


MSFT - 262 - 266ish price seems to be its resistance. It has tried to break through and just hasn't, while its bullishness continues to weaken. MSFT has its fiscal year soon and this probably will result in a final push of exuberance before the stock begins a pull back. Depending on how big of a play you want to make, look for the current support level to be its next pullback target.

\--------------------------------

AAPL - 132 - 133ish price. Behaving like MSFT, tech enthusiasts just aren't beating the bearish profit takers, or general apathy in the dogs of summer. I think AAPL is less bullish than MSFT. I don't have much news on AAPL, feel free to add. But, it's a strong company, well managed, and good products. It's just accumulated too many buyers and they are now bearish or wanting to take profits. It's holding the stock price back.

\--------------------------------

JPM - uptrend forming. Bank stocks continue to recover of a recent sell-off, but it seems to be doing so healthily. The price pulls away from the old downtrend on low volume and surges away from it on higher volume. If the price pulls back it is also on high volume. This is all good signs for a reversal. The bullishness of the banks is increasing, but it's coming out of bear country, so don't expect anything dramatic, especially in these doldrums of summer time. JPM's in one of the strongest positions of the banks. But BAC has performed better as a stock. JPM's CEO is a rockstar, JPM is sitting on a dragon's hoard of cash (not sure if actual cash or liquid assets, just reporting what they've said). JPM is betting on better bond yields for investment in the future so was not going to commit their warchest now.  


\--------------------------------

DIS - I want to be a fan of DIS, just not yet. It's coming out of bearishness, but it's barely in a bull territory. It takes a lot of buying pressure to raise the MACD at all. I liken this to no ""buoyancy"". So don't be fooled by its intraday price trends which look healthy. They can easily be erased by a slight pull back. I think DIS won't come into play until Earnings around August.

TSLA - I don't favor TSLA, I'd take profits from it if I could, but I don't think TSLA has the ability to break the 620s right now. Earlier I said it wouldn't break ""620"" and people use that against me. So it just means I need to grow and speak better about what I really think.

  
TSLA is facing massive headwinds. It isn't gaining market share or traction for all the money it's invested in breaking into the Auto industry. Other Autos are just entering the market with their EVs, FORD is like to be the biggest TSLA upsetter with the Lightning. Great name, great brand, and likely an amazing performance truck.  


While TSLA wastes its brand on trying to be a ""sporty soccer mom car.""

  
FORD will release a heavy traction, high torque electric motor truck into the market that will blow away all other trucks of its class for power. FORD is doubling down on what it's good at.  


While TSLA doesn't know what it's good at.

Tech analysis suggests TSLA is a weak bull. And weak bulls can't buck through strong resistance. I haven't reanalyzed TSLA today but it's most likely still a ""weak bull getting weaker"". Or a weak bear getting stronger.  


I suggest if you invest in TSLA right now you better be sure about it's 3month targets. Because you're going to be slipping into a trading range or a slow decline of price.  


I wouldn't say it'd go into a sell-off. Just that it's not likely to make much headway for the near term.

83,BAC," My thoughts on MSFT, AAPL, JPM, and DIS.  


I favor stocks like these because they are titans of the industry and will grow for the foreseeable future, but I want to buy them at real discounts, not perceived value-discounts (trying to determine intrinsic value, or future earnings, etc.) Stocks don't trade that way. And no matter how good a company is, it can be a bad stock.

I still see both MSFT and AAPL as knocking on a ceiling. Both will be future buying opportunities soon.  


MSFT - 262 - 266ish price seems to be its resistance. It has tried to break through and just hasn't, while its bullishness continues to weaken. MSFT has its fiscal year soon and this probably will result in a final push of exuberance before the stock begins a pull back. Depending on how big of a play you want to make, look for the current support level to be its next pullback target.

\--------------------------------

AAPL - 132 - 133ish price. Behaving like MSFT, tech enthusiasts just aren't beating the bearish profit takers, or general apathy in the dogs of summer. I think AAPL is less bullish than MSFT. I don't have much news on AAPL, feel free to add. But, it's a strong company, well managed, and good products. It's just accumulated too many buyers and they are now bearish or wanting to take profits. It's holding the stock price back.

\--------------------------------

JPM - uptrend forming. Bank stocks continue to recover of a recent sell-off, but it seems to be doing so healthily. The price pulls away from the old downtrend on low volume and surges away from it on higher volume. If the price pulls back it is also on high volume. This is all good signs for a reversal. The bullishness of the banks is increasing, but it's coming out of bear country, so don't expect anything dramatic, especially in these doldrums of summer time. JPM's in one of the strongest positions of the banks. But BAC has performed better as a stock. JPM's CEO is a rockstar, JPM is sitting on a dragon's hoard of cash (not sure if actual cash or liquid assets, just reporting what they've said). JPM is betting on better bond yields for investment in the future so was not going to commit their warchest now.  


\--------------------------------

DIS - I want to be a fan of DIS, just not yet. It's coming out of bearishness, but it's barely in a bull territory. It takes a lot of buying pressure to raise the MACD at all. I liken this to no ""buoyancy"". So don't be fooled by its intraday price trends which look healthy. They can easily be erased by a slight pull back. I think DIS won't come into play until Earnings around August. By then people will be coming out of the sleepy summer time and looking for opportunities and DIS has a lot of strong fundamentals to reveal since they are coming out of COVID slower than most companies have.

93,TSLA," TSLA - weak bull weakening.

So I took a microscope to my method on determining TSLA's situation. It is evident that it is knocking on the ceiling. I originally said I thought its ceiling was around 620 but it has knocked on 627 twice now.  


So what happened that it hit a high of \~627 two trading days ago, 630 yesterday, and 627.5 today?

  
Well - TSLA is a weak bull growing bear. And what I think is determinable now is to determine if TSLA gained buyers, lost buyers, gained sellers, lost sellers.  


Starting from T-2, there were 14 bulls and 10 bears (as I count them).

On T-1, there were 12 bulls and 7 bears.

On T-0, there were 18 bulls and 13 bears.

So what we see is proportionally, sellers pulled out on T-1 (yesterday). Don't know why, that's not really important.  


If that's a quantitative way to evaluate trend, then from T-2 to today, TSLA lost 1.3% of its bulls.

But the price was lofted higher by a disappearance of bears (sellers) yesterday, and was a headfake. It's definitely not a break-out forming. Sellers pulling back does not mean they become bulls, which is evident in the fact that the bull-team also decreased from T-2, and also only increased a net of 1 for that day.

Overall, bulls have lost a net of their position as Sellers are catching-up (gaining steam).

&#x200B;

So what is TSLA going to do through out the weak? I think i'll just be a continued drawback of the trend. I'm still not good at price targeting but 630 is a recent high, so who knows, maybe it can knock on that.

&#x200B;

The difference between 620 and 630 is just 1.5% so not really a big concern for me.

What is a big concern is TSLA is priced too high right now. It doesn't have enough bull to buck the trend and gain 2%, 3%, 5%+.

&#x200B;

I expect bears to continue to gain momentum until TSLA actually has a sell-off. But I continue to track it to better hone any skill if there is any to hone.",DarthTrader357,1,/r/investing/comments/o5il56/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h2p342p/,0.076,0.834,0.09,0.7928

XOM is an interesting stock to me, if I put money in it a couple days ago, I'd have made money. But it's a clear bear with bears earning 10 touchdowns and bulls earning 5 touchdowns.

Right now I think XOM is overbought, significantly. It's a bear stock, if oil prices goes down the stock will take a huge hit.

And today's news is Russia wants to push more oil into the market. They want that $72/bbl and they want it bad.  


This may put pressure on oil price, it may even lower oil price. In which case XOM's stock price won't weather that storm.

97,MSFT," MSFT - Bulls 14, Bears 10.

Well I decided to actually do my count and stop eyeballing it. Right now MSFT is slightly bullish  (that's a lot of touchdowns for intraday).

But it is bullish.  


I see it losing steam as MACD keeps making lower-highs while RSI keeps hitting higher overboughts.  


Also a bit about volume analysis. MSFT pulls away from the trend line on higher volume and returns to trend on lower volume, this confirms the trend line.

  
Target 6/23/2021 therefore about = $266 price.  


I can't factor for opening day adjustments, but if it opens higher or lower than close, then statistically, 78% of the time that opening gap is corrected for within 3 days.  


I think MSFT is a weakening bull. I don't see it bucking through that 260s much if at all. By next week perhaps will be trading flat.

I'd probably enter on the next pull back but watch it like a hawk if I wanted to exit with +2-4%.

I hope I'm asking on a good sub. I need advice on where to begin and what to look into.

I am 35, have a steady job, but I never invested in my life. I realized I have no savings, I live paycheck by paycheck.

I could start saving by investing. I'm interested in long term, low risk.

I could easily afford 150 EUR / month of investing.

I'm not sure if I made a mistake, but I bought 150 EUR worth of coca cola shares yesterday via Revolut. My plan was to buy each month few stocks from few different stable companies I am familiar with (Microsoft, Coca Cola, AMD, Intel, Nvidia, Apple etc.) to diversify my portoflio.

Is this a bad way to invest?

115,ABC," Let's say you get paid $1000 bi-weekly on Fridays.     

&nbsp;

If you invest $500 each Friday, then you are **dollar cost averaging** (capturing the average price).

&nbsp;

If you invest $1000 bi-weekly on pay day, then you are investing in **periodic lump sums** (investing all available budgeted funds as soon as you have funds available).

&nbsp;

Statistically, over a long period of time (years), 2 out of 3 times making periodic lump sums would have resulted in you buying shares at a lower price, but 1 out of 3 times dollar cost averaging would get you the lower price.

&nbsp;

I prefer to do periodic lump sums (investing with each paycheck, rather than split half on pay day and the other half 7 days later). When the market is in a period of correction or is crashing, you may want to switch strategies and dollar cost average. During bull run periods, it's probably better to invest with periodic lump sums.

&nbsp;

If you're a long term buy-and-hold investor (on let's say ETFs..), the difference between the two strategies isn't that much... But it's also not zero.

The problem with waiting for a better price is that if it's now worth x, but you believe it will drop to 0.8x because it's currently overvalued, but you also buy it at 0.8x and believe it will be worth x again. Then there's probably someone else with pretty similar opinion and it might even be ""correct"" that it's overvalued, but since it's fictional value it's extremely difficult to be exactly right.

Here you really think you are right it will go all the eay down to 0.8x as you predicted according to your calculations, but there's been some growth and other people really don't want to miss out and suddenly there's an unexpected positive announcement of a new product or service and now it's at 1.04x and you missed out on that 2% dividend they also had while you waited for ot to go down.

131,REAL," You need to compare this to their inflation as well as currency fluctuations. Back in the 80’s, the US had interest rates around 18%, however, inflation was only slightly less so your REAL return was only a few percent.

If you are paid 18% by a Turkish bank and lose 17% to inflation, your real return is only 1%. If the Turkish Lira drops relative to USD, you will lose money when you try to convert back into USD. So even a “high” 18% interest rate could lose you money.",thatsmrPEtoheadtoyou,1,/r/investing/comments/o5c465/thoughts_on_turkish_market/h2nf8pa/,0.083,0.833,0.083,0.0

133,GF," >Samsung has a history of being a little ""generous"" with the description of their node sizes

So does TSMC, it's all marketing. Intel is being forced to rename their nodes because of how ""generous"" TSMC is, which has led to a lot of consumer confusion. For example, Intel's 10nm is actually smaller than both TSMC's 7nm and Samsung's 7nm, because the true equivalent sizes of these nodes are 9nm (Intel) and 10nm (TSMC and Samsung).

Here's how manufacturing nodes rank based on half-pitch scaling of an equivalent (in transistor density) planar transistor node:
