12,ALL," Logistics professional with 12 years experience and a mid sized motor carrier here. I have to say I'm a shareholder and fan of Tesla as a company, I think it's the future. But most of you have no idea how trucking works - and that's ok, you are not in the industry. ""80% of trucking routes are 250mi or less"" - first of all this statistic includes last mile deliveries, not OTR (over-the-road AKA long haul). It includes smaller trucks with smaller GVW capacity and cost far less than $150k. Second - those routes usually originate from or go to distribution centers - serviced by long haul OTR carriers again.With the current range those Teslas might be competitive in local deliveries, but the infrastructure for long haul is non existent - they don't stand a chance in mid-range long-range OTR. Also no sane carrier will ever buy 1st year models - they always have too many issues to be sorted out. I never owned a tesla, but I've heard their quality control is not the best. If this happens with trucks - who's gonna fix them? ALL trucks break down ALL the time - even brand new ones. I don't care that Teslas have less moving parts - pulling 80k lbs in different temperatures, altitudes, humidity and road conditions will wear down any machine. You might not have DPF issues, but you will have electrical problems! You might not have turbo blowout, but you still have axles, driveshafts, airbags and a ton of other components that wear down. Most shops will not have any mechanics trained to fix electric trucks for years - you'll have to tow it only to Tesla dealerships who'll be overloaded in a few months.  Big megacarriers (JB Hunt, US Express ,Schneider) might buy them for publicity stunt and to please shareholders, but these trucks are not a smart business decision any every logistics specialist who ever saw a truck knows that.

These trucks will have downtime (time spend in a shop). Saying these trucks will have lower cost of operating is a really stupid statement. What are the costs of the parts? Lifespan? Batteries quality? Recharging issues? This isn't a car, fellas, the the truck clock between 100k and over 300k (with a team) per year. What happens when you recharge those batteries 100 times in less than a few months in different weather condition? It's not that simple.

You are making a big mistake if you think Tesla  with 4 years experience will build a more profitable or reliable truck than Freightliner or Volvo. It's a great start, but it's at least a decade away from what it inspires to be. There's a niche for these trucks, but they'll be far from being a market maker. There's a reason you don't see many Uber drivers running with a Tesla model 3.",Glarus30,3,/r/stocks/comments/onzw0p/tesla_semi_electric_truck_is_finally_about_to_go/h5vsijc/,0.071,0.88,0.048,-0.902

18,AC," Hyliion will be the more attractive option until a lot of things are figured out. There aren't enough car chargers let alone semi chargers. I'm in construction and thinking about the massive electrical infrastructure needed to charge a fleet of semis is crazy. Would a giant fleet want to make the investment of spending an insane amount of money to charge their fleet? Would the electrical utility even be able to supply them that much demand? Also the demand it would put on the grid when most grids can't even handle a hot day after the sun goes down and solar goes offline and everyone is still running AC, people get home from work  and start charging their EV's.

28,ICE," Tesla, Nikola, and other electric tractors will start to dominate local hauling. If you can run it all day and return it to the same charging stall every night, and get rid of all the ICE maintenance costs, it's beyond a no-brainer.

34,NKLA," A minor correction is needed to your above comment. Hyliion's ERX CAN run on fossil fuels (CNG) but it can also run of RNG. Using RNG as a fuel source lowers the total emissions profile of the ERX to net carbon negative. 

As much as 60% of the USA is powered by coal plants, is the Tesla really making the air cleaner if the electricity it is using to charge it's batteries is power by a coal plant (which is more pollutive than CNG).

Additional, as it currently stands 90% of hydrogen produced today is created using a methane gas recapture process, which is more pollutive than just running a diesel truck. The way that NKLA wants to approach the Hydrogen production problem (using solar at every hydrogen fueling station to produce 100% of the hydrogen at the station throught electrolysis)is a great IDEA, but does not work out mathematical. Even based on liberal current solar panel efficiency estimates (40% of energy captured from sunlight), you would need exorbitantly large solar farms at each refueling station.

140,AI," Is Lucid a company to look out for? Yes. Is it a stock to look out for? No.

To answer your questions:
_________ 
*What do you all think and when is the right time to buy more shares of LUCID motors?*

When they've shown a clear path towards mass production and the financials look well enough to get there, and the market cap has come down at least 50%.

_________ 
*Also do you all think it is a good time to play short time options?*

You have to be mental to trade short term options on a pre-revenue company and expect to make money.
_________ 
*Also how do you all compare TESLA with LUCID and is LUCID a competion to TESLA or they go totally different ways?*

Tesla is a billion startups in one, and will become the world's biggest automaker and the most profitable company in the world through their AI software (FSD and Autobidder), Lucid has a chance of becoming a small to medium sized automaker. No, they're not competition but they could coexist.
_________ 
*What will happen to the stock price when it merges with Lucid?*

Nothing, but the market cap will start displaying its true value (currently somewhere in the $20Bs I believe)
_________ 
*Do you all think the price of the LUCID car is too much?*

Hell yes. They're valued almost the same as Tesla was when they were selling 250.000+ cars per year, and they haven't even sold a single vehicle.
_________ 
*Do you think they will use a well known software and how soon it can happen?*

Unsure, but I am confident that Lucid understands the importance of software well enough to not equip their cars with software as shitty as the legacy automakers' cars.
_________ 
*What do they have to learn from the combustion cars and TESLA.*

Everything that's to do with mass scale manufacturing.",Ehralur,3,/r/stocks/comments/oo52k6/will_lucid_motors_be_a_company_to_keep_a_look_out/h5wgagm/,0.05,0.825,0.125,0.9648

160,GOOG," I suggest you do more research than ‘everyone i know’ and get some more numbers on their current usage across products, core demographics and their growth. You should be able to access some of these from their earnings reports.

I also want to debunk your claim on ‘everyone I know has a gmail account in the professional world’ 
My profession is working for Microsoft Outlook and our mobile client alone has over 300 million active users and most are actually enterprise clients. (They’re using it for work). 

I like gmail, but in regards to how Google grows and earns money and grows - gmail isn’t a huge piece of that pie. I suspect a lot would be from cloud storage and ad revenue through Google search engine and YouTube. 

You may also consider seeing numbers of their search queries on google. For a long time and even still I believe they’re number one but for others like Duck Duck Go and Bing, usage is increasing. This is in line for users seeking more privacy to their data.

I’m not a bear, not bull on GOOG and don’t own the stock personally.

161,AI," I happen to be bullish on Google. It’s essentially a holding company that has a strong grip on the future of AI and autonomous driving, as well as reams of data and a sticky operating ecosystem. 

The bear case is that as far as revenue, most of it comes from online ads and search, so everything else is just a high risk bet with no clear revenue stream immediately emerging. Antitrust sentiment could break the company up and hamper Google’s ability to see its bets through to completion. 

I don’t put a lot of weight toward that but it’s worth considering that Google gives away a lot “for free” and currently isn’t monetizing a lot of what it puts out.

163,IMO," I completely agree with your post so will be listening to see if anyone comes up with anything.

Google controls the flow of information for over 90% of population and there is endless ways to monetize and Google has barely even got started, IMO.

Plus their share has actually increased YoY.    Their chief competitor, Microsoft, actually lost over a 15% of their market share in just the last year and continues to decline.  With all of the Microsoft decline going to Google.

https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share

Microsoft 2.75% -> 2.31% 

Google 91.75% -> 92.47%

Search is about as locked in to Google that you can get.   Google is a verb.

But then there is so many other things at Google.   YouTube for example this year will surpass all of Netflix in size based on Revenue.   YouTube is the second most popular web site and only second to Google search.  So Google owns #1 and #2 and their lead is increasing!   YouTube is just one unit of Google.  Plus Google keeps adding new assets to monetize in the future.    Google now has over 150 million DAU with Google Classroom.    There is the over a billion Android devices sold each year and Google charges zilch for Android.

Without any additional expense so right to the bottom line.   This is why Google is such a great investment.  Google has yet to monetize much of their assets fully.

Only this year are they starting to charge for Google Photos storage for example.  So they lose an expense and gain new revenue.   So good on both sides of the equation.

A HUGE one is allowing the ad blocking with YouTube.  They can easily end as we can see with Youtube TV.  No ability to block ads.   They just do the ads instream instead of out of stream.

Google can do this because they own 100% of YouTube.  So there is no reason to handle the ad out of stream.

218,AAPL," I tried my version of day trading, which involved buying putting 100% of my portfolio into an index fund or blue chip if it dips during the morning, and trying to sell it for a small profit (for example 1% gain). I tried this out for a short period (a few months), experimenting with different stocks like AAPL/MSFT/VOO/TQQQ etc. It's not easy, but it is doable. Sometimes you do just make a bad buy and need to wait a while before you can sell for profit. It's important to set an exit price and sell. I consider my method EXTREMELY amateur, and did 0 actual analysis. It was literally just based on buying if there was a big dip during the morning. With TQQQ, I could actually repeat this several times a day since on some days there are a lot of ups and downs. A ""greedy"" play would be selling TQQQ for a dollar higher than I bought. Conservative would be quickly cashing out if it goes up like 30-40 cents. It sounds small, but if you're buying hundreds of shares, you can make a couple hundred dollars every day doing this, and it doesn't exactly require that much work.

Why? You'd think they'd be a value stock, but note rails are the cheapest per ton when moving across land. Thus all the essentials tied to the economy, from coal to natural gas to grain to batteries to cars to consumer products to equipment gets moved by increasingly busy rails.

I can personally vouch they're always backed up stuff to move. I use to work there and it's a mess.

But it's insanely profitable. Manpower costs are low because a two man crew can move hundreds of truckloads of material. It's the mist fuel efficient mode of transit with 1 gallon moving a hundred tons several miles IIRC. The equipment is built to last, which is why railroad always look old because everything is used for decades, which is very efficient.

237,AAL," Also, just as an example as to when tax harvesting can be useful. This is a move I made recently, the numbers are made up but the strategy was used. I’ve done pretty well this year, let’s say 100k returns. They were short term so I’ll owe approx 24k in taxes. I have multiple losing stocks right now thanks to recent markets. My biggest losers are in airlines and oil. I own multiple companies in each sector, ones I think will do well long term. I’m highly convicted all of them will eventually make me a return long term. So, using airlines as an example, let’s say I sell my losing AAL position harvest the losses and then reinvest that capital back into UAL. I’m effectively still invested in the airline recovery play with the same amount of cash, but because I sold AAL and put it into UAL that sell counts as a loss on my tax bill but it’s now invested in UAL so it should theoretically still generate a similar return, I’m just benefiting on the recent decline to lower my taxes. Let’s say I can do that with several positions, the decision on what is a good tax harvest is solely up to you.  But let’s say I can generate a 12k loss from the harvest. Yes it is a 12k loss now, but remember those funds after the sale still end up reinvested into a “winning” company (by your own projections) to generate similar returns. So I’m really just using those realized losses to lower a huge short term gain tax year. Now my tax bill instead of being on 100k is on 88k which works out to be 21k in taxes. I reduced my tax bill by about 3k. Doesn’t sound like much but that’s 3% extra that otherwise gets left on the table. Not to mention if I can now hold those UAL stocks that I mentioned above for more than a year (which I would plan to) I now converted those 12k gains I offset into long term capital gains instead of short term. So now I only owe 15% instead of 24%, saving and additional 1.2k for a total of 4.2% extra profit on that 100k in earnings by the one move.

So, get a ~$600 benefit now, or 100% of what it might gain in 30 days (assuming his LTCG+ordinary income will be below $40.4k when he sells; 85% if his OI is over 40.4k).

Since he can buy back in in 31 days, that's all we're discussing.

246,IRS," Day-trading accounts are margin accounts and get 4X buying power vs the 2X that ordinary margin accounts get. To get this they have to end each day with $25K in free cash. The leverage can be reused throughout the day but if you exceed the limit set at 4X your previous day's closing cash, you get a margin call the next day and you have to meet it even if you already cashed out and aren't trading. 

The need for a margin call is determined by checking at the end of the day if you still have cash that's at least 25% of your largest position during the day.

So if you start with $25K in the morning and buy and sell up to a basis of $100K repeatedly, you can do that several times in one day. If at the end of the day you suffer a loss and have only $24K after you close out you won't be allowed to daytrade the next day (because you are below the $25K minimum) and you will get a margin call (because you no longer have 25% margin to cover the largest position you took that day).

If you fail to close all of your positions and end up with insufficient cash, the same things can happen.

If you ever go over the 4X limit at any point during the day you will get a margin call for that.

If you don't meet a call immediately you will be stuck at 2X leverage and if you don't meet it in a week you will be put into a cash-only status until the call is met or 90 days pass. In any case once you meet the call you have to keep that money in the account for two more days.

If you actually daytrade the whole year the IRS will let you report your gains as your ending account value minus your starting account value, instead of making you list the basis and proceeds for every transaction.",merlinsbeers,1,/r/stocks/comments/onr98e/what_is_day_trading/h5u50e8/,0.051,0.908,0.042,-0.6369

248,AI," I have your story. I decided to gamble my Christmas bonus of £5k on GME, which at one point was worth £40k, but I sold at £17k after it started dumping. 

Since then I thought I was being sensible picking ICLN, a global clean energy etf that was seeing decent returns. Well that tanked 30% and I sold at that point to get up with Blackberry since I thought ICLN won't break even as fast as BB rose. 

That was only partially true and i've basically only got £1k profit since Jan. 

I was feeling like you.

I recently sold everything and thought about and picked a stock based on my research. 3 weeks ago I picked Darktrace (DARK) and put all on that since I like risks. I've made £3.6k profit so far. DARK was up 7% today alone. They're a cyber security company, mcap £5bn, floated on the stock exchange in April, 90% up since, current price 720p.

I chose DARK for 2 main reasons, one being that on the London Stock Exchange, we don't really have growth techy kind of companies, but young people are starting to invest and so more likely to pick it; and the other reason because they're growing massively and have a cool idea for the industry.

Darktrace's product is an AI that is connected to the organisation and learns the day to day operations, so if something unusual happens, it will flag and a person can investigate. This is a different way of doing cyber security, since traditionally you'd have a cyber security team that basically whitelists stuff. This monitors logs from programs, emails, server requests, logins - all sorts.

>Annualised recurring revenue at end-June was at least $340 million, it said, representing year-on-year growth in constant currency of at least 44%, well above the 35% that analysts at Berenberg said they had forecast.

However, they still make a loss, so it's risk. But the mcap isn't outrageously high at £5bn
