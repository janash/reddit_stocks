0,CAN," I would recommend NOT looking at ETFs in isolation, but considering what you need to build a portfolio that is aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

For example, we know that diversification is important to protect against crashes and reduce volatility without reducing returns.  Everyone thinks they can sit through a 30,40,50%+ drawdown without flinching but you never know how you'll react until it happens.  YOu need to have a plan.  And don't go all into a sector/industry just because it's done well over the past 5-10 years. 

Levered ETFs CAN be used in a portfolio but you have to consider how badly they'll do in a drawdown and have a risk management plan.  Check out hedgefundie's excellent adventure [here](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/hedgefundie-adventure/) - this is a good example of how construct a simple portfolio with high expected returns and manageable risk that won't wipe you out in a crash.

1,AI," You're young enough, you have time. There's no need to get crazy with a leveraged ETF. If you want to sleep at night, stay the hell away.

My opinion is either QQQ (the non-leveraged version of TQQQ) or ARKK. Everyone gives Ark shit saying they hold so many speculative companies, but go take a look at their holdings. PayPal, Tesla, Square, Pinterest, Twilio, etc. Some might call them speculative, but the fact is these are very well run and promising companies that will likely succeed in the future.

Maybe do a split between QQQ, ARKK, and something else that has a narrow focus. There are ETF's for things such as cybersecurity, big data, renewable energy, robotics, AI, automation, etc. Take your risks now and hold for the long run.",HesitantInvestor0,5,/r/stocks/comments/p47uy7/best_etf_for_someone_willing_to_take_on_higher/h8wt048/,0.078,0.795,0.127,0.7933

Now if you're just investing in some rando ultra risky company that doesn't really have a solid market share, that's going to have some big risks of losing a lot of your investment.

So I see what you're saying, but I think there are less 'risky' risky stocks out there, you just have to look around and not just invest in something merely because it's an EV related company(like NKLA for instance).

That said, there don't seem to be that many deals out there. Kinda wish the Fed would stop printing for a second so some truly good deals might come around.

12,LEAP," That's not how to do it successfully.

First, LEAPS are higher risk / higher reward than LETFs, and for many an LETF like UPRO that can drop 96% during the bottom of a recession, is too much volatility already, so with that warning even more volatility and risk:

The way to buy LEAPS is deep ITM.  If there is a correction, you do not lose everything, it's much closer to holding the underlying than a normal options play.  The farther out the LEAP is (say 2 years+) then volatility no longer affects price, so you can buy during a crash when volatility is high and it will work out far better than if you buy eg 4 months to expiration, as LEAPS are closer to a pure delta play.

The next rule of LEAPS is you only DCA into them, so if you lose ""everything"" during a stock market crash, you've only lost what you've DCAed.  Once the LEAPS profits (or loses everything) then you buy less risky investments, so your total holding of LEAPS at any given time is small, usually 5% of your total holdings.

And finally, when it comes to LEAPS you do not roll, you do not adjust, you take your winnings a month or so before expiration (to minimize theta), or you exercise the option to collect dividends, and on the other end you let your losers run.  You go down with the ship.  This is backwards from most options plays so it should probably be mentioned, but with buying LEAPS you're going to have a better P&L if you simply do not mess with them.  That's just how it works.",proverbialbunny,37,/r/stocks/comments/p47uy7/best_etf_for_someone_willing_to_take_on_higher/h8xkgy5/,0.071,0.834,0.094,0.8284

There's a lot of alienation against the latter technology for many different reasons, and some of them don't have easy solutions (e.g., negative moral sentiment; physical side-effects with use like vertigo, headaches, and nausea). I can't help but draw a parallel to Google Glass; it used to be all anyone would ever talk about, and after about half a year of hype, no one cared about it anymore. It doesn't help that they're really getting themselves into the same tangle that made Facebook a widely hated enterprise by further encroaching on privacy. I honestly think their best chance going forward is sticking to their bread & butter, making phones/tablets/laptops/desktops, and following through on their own chips.

121,SBSW," I don't think a stock that has lost 50% from its one-year high is a very attractive long term investment; unless we're talking about betting on an overcorrection. But that's like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller: such a large drawdown is often related to changes in regulators, substantial losses to competitors causing obsolescence of the company's business, or a business event large enough to call into question the company's long-term stability.

If I were to recommend a stock far enough away from its 52-week high, I think it would be SBSW.

Finally, if you're in it for the long run, I think the following segments might be of interest to you:

* Energy transportation
* Energy storage
* EV batteries recycling

These are segments should more or less match what you are looking for, especially since the recent greentechs drop.

But I digress.

Companies DO (sometimes) have educational presentations for their employees, and sometimes the investment banker sends someone to help. I’ve worked at a company where this was done. (Maybe it was a one-time thing at acquisition) Do take advantage of this if offered!

Otherwise, you should consult with a good tax accountant to make sure you don’t get burned like a friend of mine that was an early Qualcomm employee.

223,DD," I'm just going to put it out there, there is a good reason why people don't touch IPOS, especially if you need to deep dive into something without documents widely available. But I would look for 1 field you know a lot about and a niche that no many understand.  I;m just going to point out the issues many face:

1. You have no idea what documents are real or not. Numbers could be fake for all you know and ""strategies"" written up by some intern no longer there.

2. For every small cap that gets on, I bet more than 50% of them never get anywhere. That is a massive risk.

3. You are limited in your pick of stocks, these may be in areas you have no knowledge in or fields which are very volatile. Martin Shkreli would short these small caps because a lot of retail investors lack any knowledge in medical fields, and he would make bank on it because so many people were piling on money in new ""cures"" that never get anywhere.

If you decide to look into IPOS, pick that 1 area that you truly understand. Something that you are very capable at and also something that is linked to the general market. You have to do unconventional things like maybe phoning the company to do DD, or track their finances through their majority shareholders earnings by where they live or tracking their employment history and etc.",EitherToe,3,/r/stocks/comments/p41k28/what_should_investors_look_for_in_ipos/h8vngvh/,0.09,0.86,0.05,-0.8559

Beebower/ hood/ brinson and the followup beebower/ singler/ hood seminal articles proves the fallacy of individual stock investing.

The second article was a follow up period over the next 10 year period to make sure it wasn't a fluke.

I hope people pay attention to the contributors...and just follow them over time and make your own decisions.  I hate to hear stories of people getting suck in and lose money

I for one, don't have much money. I don't know about Ya'll. i am sure most of us on here have a job. a mortgage and kids trying to make a little extra for retirement/family vacation/kids schools and shit

Not everyone seeks to buy Lambo and shit. 

i am 58yo...so just share my view. Personally I dont have much time to 'start over' like the 20s & 30s year olds on here. 

Good luck to all. and stay safe n healthy! (not medical advice!)

I have a friend just die 2 months ago. same age. My 'wants' in life is different

Hate the hedge funds taking our hard earn money.

Not correct anymore. Works beautifully with 100% debt. 

The question is: are we shifting the economy into that kind of a scenario (statement 1) where people are glad they get ""something"" back (like people are happy they get dividends). 

Something allowed the ""zombie companies"" to get to where they are today. Inflation CAN NOT RISE (in Europe at least) because you will see countries default. So they keep printing and forgiving debt. 

Why not print and forgive companies?
