1,PDT," Uh.... lol OK, let's get some facts straight here. You posted this is in the Pennystock section. So, right away there's a few questions that need answering:

1. Do you live in the US?
2. If you live in the US, are you using Fidelity?
3. If you live in the US and you are not using Fidelity, you're not using a margin account.
4. If you are using Fidelity and a margin account with more than 25k in it, there's no PDT rule.
5. There is no such thing as a PDT rule on cash accounts. If you have settled funds, you can make as many trades as you want until you don't.",BagboyBrown,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/nbt37k/how_many_times_have_you_lost_money_instead_of/gy213vy/,0.037,0.884,0.079,0.5984

26,PDT," Yes, and you will be flagged with PDT (pattern day trader) status but you can also request PDT status be removed from your account once every 6 months. So you can day trade 4 times in one day, then have the PDT reset and be able to day trade again with no issues after the normal 5 day reset period. I’ve personally experienced this and it was a relief haha. 

PDT also does not follow you from broker to broker.  I was using up to 9 day trades a week across 3 brokers with no issues.
You could theoretically day trade 3x (number of brokers with margin/day trading privileges) each week. So maybe something like 20x day trades if you wanted to keep track of 8 brokerage accounts. 

Its debatable whether encouraging day traders with less than 25k to split up their money into multiple brokers for more day trades is a good thing, but it does let you more easily experience the pros/cons of each broker.

For example, Robinhood trading hours are 8:58am - 6pm. Webull allows 4am-8pm among other things including shorting.",samnater,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/nbt37k/how_many_times_have_you_lost_money_instead_of/gy2zls3/,0.029,0.84,0.131,0.9684

I love REITS because there is a law that they have to dispense 90% of what they make back to shareholders.  There are plenty of REITS, like NYMT, that will pay you a 9% dividend.

A lot of us here invest in speculative growth stocks, which can get hammered if market sentiment turns negative or if treasury rates start climbing.  Inflation fears, which we are seeing now.

Investing in REITs to add some value side to your portfolio, steady income/dividend payments , in my opinion, is a great way to average down the overall risk of your portfolio.  I like NYMT the best.

Not trying to bash this stock, and I hope it works out for the investors.  But wake me up when they resume the dividend.

92,DD," I've seen a lot of mention of KPAY and GGII on the penny stock boards over the past week or so. I didn't invest (regretting it now), because they both had warnings on [otcmarkets.com](https://otcmarkets.com). I try to do some DD on a stock before putting money into it, regardless of how low the price is. I came across RNVA last week - I've done some research and can't find anything negative about them, except they did a reverse split last July, which may be why their share price tumbled from $4 to 0.0009 (where it is now). Just wondering if anyone has done any DD on them. If so, any thoughts? I just put $1K into them, hoping the price may go up to a dime or more.
