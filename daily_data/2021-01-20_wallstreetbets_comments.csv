0,GME,"Sir, please file for a GME proxy contest for a seat on BOD, hopefully it will trigger a share recall and short squeeze, and the most epic YOLO update ever. And it can be done at a fraction of your gains so far.

Your name will be in future textbooks on value investing, shareholder activism, and internet culture ! And if you manage to win a seat on BOD, hey, what's wrong with that ?

\-----------------------

EDIT: to everyone, thanks for the upvotes, and the awards (not sure what I can do with them, but much appreciated).

Due to the high short interest in GME, proxy contest and share recall can exert significant upward pressure on the stock price. Please spread this far and wide as this is a factor that should be considered by all market participants.",0.033,0.76,0.207,0.9635

Then set lower limits for selling. Example: GME reaches $450, set sell limit (maybe like 50% of all GME stocks) to $420.69 in case it starts to tank while you're on the shitter. If instead, it reaches $500, set new sell limit to $475. Rinse an repeat. Let the some of your stocks ride through in case of a huge dip that triggers your limit but then continues to rise.

# Retard FAQ

**Is it too late to buy???**

No

**I bought shares at $38, should I sell today since I heard there's going to be a dip?**

Definitely not.  If anything you need to buy more.  Selling your shares actually helps the hedge funds on the other side of this stock play.

**Should I buy on margin?**

No.  This again helps the hedge funds.

**But it’s bouncing around $42 and I didn’t get in at $36 and now I’m in the red and—**

*lays hand on forehead .* My child, very soon none of these little ups and downs are going to matter.  Try to imagine if you'd bought in at $4 and it dropped to $2 earlier this year, would the stress of that change mean anything to you today if you had gotten in that early?

**What’s happening? :c**

[7 minute video describing what a short squeeze is](https://youtu.be/XAyaQaWajpI) \- VERY good

[10 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iPUqCw1Skc) \- compares this GME short squeeze to the last mother of all short squeezes (MOASS) in 2008 with VW

**But my mom read an apple news article and is saying it’s for sure going to $20!!?**

Straight up this is the signal that they’re getting so desperate they’re actually trying coordinated efforts to scare people to sell right now.  Don’t be a 🌈 🐻 and believe these jackasses.  NUMBERS DONT LIE.  When you see a sudden uptick in random people just spreading fear and doubt without anything to back it up, they're just little bootlicking bitches.  We're right, and they're depending on us listening to them and not being our retard selves and ignoring institutional advice that only serves these hedge funds.

Their announcement of an announcement that of a livestream for 5 reasons why GME is going to $20 came within 60 seconds of \~1 million shares being shorted yesterday.  These were two coordinated, bold faced efforts to drive the stock down after a 25% bull run to $45 because the pain was too much for them.  It's even better because they couldn't even drive it down below $37.  Losers.

**Okay, when do I buy?**

Today, Wednesday 1/20, the institutional assholes that are trying to weasel out of their bullshit play are trying to suppress stock today to save themselves which is hilarious to me because they made the biggest mistake ever by telling us the date and time when they are going to do this.  📄🤲pussies will fall for this and sell, but not you.  You're going to buy that dip and hold.

**Okay, but WHEN do I buy?  What price should I go in on??**

My personal philosophy, backed up by [another amazing DD pos](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/)t by u/FatAspirations, is that you're thinking like a trader and fussing over a few dollars of volatility when you need to be thinking like a venture capitalist who just needs to get in at *all*.  I'm in for 13K right now, another 5K is getting deposited this morning and you know what?  I'm going to buy today at 11:30am EST no matter what the price is to give the bird to these institutional asshats that have continued to work over the good and honest retard for decades because I know it doesn't matter if I go in at 15, 30, 60 dollars.  The insane short squeeze we are about to witness dwarfs any ups and downs while we're still sitting at a steal of $30-some dollars.

**Okay, I'm in, but when do I sell?  How high will this go?**

I'm just a humble retard, but I say this in earnest: the answers lie within you.  By this I mean *whenever we decide to sell*.  If we want to sell at $420.69, we could, but I feel like that's lacking imagination for a short squeeze.  We have the high ground.  We have a highly motivated group of bright eyed autists who are ride or die GME and are *anticipating* *and* *understand* this squeeze.  These short sellers have no control right now and are *bleeding*, we can literally sell at $1,000 or $3,200 per share once the bloodshed starts.  To the moon?  I'm riding this rocket to friggin' Saturn.  $5,000 per share.

**$5,000?  Really...?  That seems...high.**

Some of you are in disbelief we could get to 5 grand.  Let me say this again: the share holders have the power here.  The share is water, we're in the Sahara desert, these little milk toast billionaires are coming up to you begging for a liter of water for $100 after they made you lose your house over a liter of water in 2008, screwed your wife, and took a shit on your dog.  No.  Maybe we want $1,000 for that liter of water.  Maybe **FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A LITER.  We know you can afford it Melvin.**

**How far down do you predict the dip will get to?**

* If you're trying to optimize your buy to catch an extra buck-- [see this amazing DD post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) about treating this as a capital venture instead of a trade.

Big reward requires big balls my friends, we take -50% dips in stride and just. keep.

We came pretty damn close yesterday.

**Okay yeah yeah, but are there actually enough of us to buy enough shares to make this squeeze happen?**

The short sellers have been practicing naked short selling for almost a month and a half now, meaning they've shorted more shares than actually exist in the market.  So the answer actually is: ""we already have"".  All of this edging up to 40 and backing off is just going to make this epic cash-filled climax of GME sausage that much longer and intense.

I’m on my phone and on day two of being so wired that every night feels like christmas.  If you’re a new autist and have questions plz have your wife’s boyfriend read this to you.  I know a lot of us are millennials and not used to anything going well for us so it’s hard to realize that we just lack the imagination to see that this is a surety and to grasp how high these gains will be.

Shit everything’s been getting worse for us since 9/11.  But no, this isn’t a bad “bet” because frankly that implies risk.  This is still a risk, but as a longtime autist lurker and more passive investor this is the first stock play that I'm doing a YOLO on.

Just do what we say and don’t be a little paper handed whiney bitch and you’ll be on your way to tendie town.  These well resourced hedge funds are lying to you to save themselves, but remember numbers don’t lie.

# Retard FAQ

**Is it too late to buy???**

No

**I bought shares at $38, should I sell today since I heard there's going to be a dip?**

Definitely not.  If anything you need to buy more.  Selling your shares actually helps the hedge funds on the other side of this stock play.

**Should I buy on margin?**

No.  This again helps the hedge funds.

**But it’s bouncing around $42 and I didn’t get in at $36 and now I’m in the red and—**

*lays hand on forehead .* My child, very soon none of these little ups and downs are going to matter.  Try to imagine if you'd bought in at $4 and it dropped to $2 earlier this year, would the stress of that change mean anything to you today if you had gotten in that early?

**What’s happening? :c**

[7 minute video describing what a short squeeze is](https://youtu.be/XAyaQaWajpI) \- VERY good

[10 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iPUqCw1Skc) \- compares this GME short squeeze to the last mother of all short squeezes (MOASS) in 2008 with VW

**But my mom read an apple news article and is saying it’s for sure going to $20!!?**

Straight up this is the signal that they’re getting so desperate they’re actually trying coordinated efforts to scare people to sell right now.  Don’t be a 🌈 🐻 and believe these jackasses.  NUMBERS DONT LIE.  When you see a sudden uptick in random people just spreading fear and doubt without anything to back it up, they're just little bootlicking bitches.  We're right, and they're depending on us listening to them and not being our retard selves and ignoring institutional advice that only serves these hedge funds.

Their announcement of an announcement that of a livestream for 5 reasons why GME is going to $20 came within 60 seconds of \~1 million shares being shorted yesterday.  These were two coordinated, bold faced efforts to drive the stock down after a 25% bull run to $45 because the pain was too much for them.  It's even better because they couldn't even drive it down below $37.  Losers.

**Okay, when do I buy?**

Today, Wednesday 1/20, the institutional assholes that are trying to weasel out of their bullshit play are trying to suppress stock today to save themselves which is hilarious to me because they made the biggest mistake ever by telling us the date and time when they are going to do this.  📄🤲pussies will fall for this and sell, but not you.  You're going to buy that dip and hold.

**Okay, but WHEN do I buy?  What price should I go in on??**

My personal philosophy, backed up by [another amazing DD pos](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/)t by u/FatAspirations, is that you're thinking like a trader and fussing over a few dollars of volatility when you need to be thinking like a venture capitalist who just needs to get in at *all*.  I'm in for 13K right now, another 5K is getting deposited this morning and you know what?  I'm going to buy today at 11:30am EST no matter what the price is to give the bird to these institutional asshats that have continued to work over the good and honest retard for decades because I know it doesn't matter if I go in at 15, 30, 60 dollars.  The insane short squeeze we are about to witness dwarfs any ups and downs while we're still sitting at a steal of $30-some dollars.

**Okay, I'm in, but when do I sell?  How high will this go?**

I'm just a humble retard, but I say this in earnest: the answers lie within you.  By this I mean *whenever we decide to sell*.  If we want to sell at $420.69, we could, but I feel like that's lacking imagination for a short squeeze.  We have the high ground.  We have a highly motivated group of bright eyed autists who are ride or die GME and are *anticipating* *and* *understand* this squeeze.  These short sellers have no control right now and are *bleeding*, we can literally sell at $1,000 or $3,200 per share once the bloodshed starts.  To the moon?  I'm riding this rocket to friggin' Saturn.  $5,000 per share.

**$5,000?  Really...?  That seems...high.**

Some of you are in disbelief we could get to 5 grand.  Let me say this again: the share holders have the power here.  The share is water, we're in the Sahara desert, these little milk toast billionaires are coming up to you begging for a liter of water for $100 after they made you lose your house over a liter of water in 2008, screwed your wife, and took a shit on your dog.  No.  Maybe we want $1,000 for that liter of water.  Maybe **FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A LITER.  We know you can afford it Melvin.**

**How far down do you predict the dip will get to?**

* If you're trying to optimize your buy to catch an extra buck-- [see this amazing DD post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) about treating this as a capital venture instead of a trade.

Big reward requires big balls my friends, we take -50% dips in stride and just. keep.

We came pretty damn close yesterday.

**Okay yeah yeah, but are there actually enough of us to buy enough shares to make this squeeze happen?**

The short sellers have been practicing naked short selling for almost a month and a half now, meaning they've shorted more shares than actually exist in the market.  So the answer actually is: ""we already have"".  All of this edging up to 40 and backing off is just going to make this epic cash-filled climax of GME sausage that much longer and intense.

The battle continues. Both sides are becoming more and more exhausted. WSB has starting posting copypasta to keep hope alive while Sherman recruited a fruit to help out.

Wall Street Bets came up and bought it

with diamond hands they knew they'd profit

if they could only hold
​
Soon may the tendieman come

to send our rocket into the sun

One day when the trading is done

we'll take our gains and go

No deals were cut, no shorts were squeezed

The captain's mind was not on greed

But he belonged to the autist's creed

He took the risk to hold

to send our rocket into the sun

One day when the trading is done

we'll take our gains and go

the stock went up then down once more

All gains were lost, it was looking poor

but still those traders did hold

the shorts not squeezed and the gains not won

to encourage the captain, crew and all

The heat has been intensifying recently with short sellers making big moves to suppress GME's share price. Today at 11:30EST [one of them](https://mobile.twitter.com/CitronResearch) was supposed to host some live event to shit on GME. They announced it yesterday and interestingly the same minute the tweet went out like 2M shares dropped on the market (causing the price to drop). They ""forgot"" about the inauguration and called it off this morning. LOL.

**Note to all smooth brains:** Please don't jump in to GME without doing your own research and making your own decision. This is not investment advice. This stock is going to be volatile as shit.

He went all in on gamestop. Diamond hands. We aren't rich. We use our income wisely and I had 1900$ to invest. I made some nice moves, got it up to 2500$ and bought GME at 36$.

He bought some stocks I suggested, enphase, icln, yrcw, sold for a few hundred profit and is also now all on on GME.

Shorting and purposely bankrupting GME would literally cause thousands of people to lose their jobs during COVID. No sympathy what so ever for this guy. Me and a couple of friends are in GME just to support everyone’s fight against the shorts. Diamond handing all the way. I don’t give a fuck if I lose, every day I’m fucking holding means shorters are bleeding interest. Not gonna sell until all the shorts are on their knees. We are planning to give the brokers a call tmr telling them not to loan our stocks for shorting. If the funds wants fucking peace, we shall give them peace the same way Romans gave peace to Carthage.

WSB has a lot of people who have bought stock, but there aren’t abject falsehoods being posted about GME. There aren’t blatant deceptive tactics from promoters like with penny stock pump n dumps.

Say they borrowed at 30 to sell. So they’re up $30. They pay interest on market price. So as it rises to $40 ish for a bit, they pay more interest. The rate also increased from probably a low 10% to 50% to probably 100% or something. 


So now they are after 1mo paying let’s say 80% interest on $38 avg price, equal to $2.58. 


They had +$30, now -$2.58 = $27.42. Profit. 

If it takes another month then profit drops to 24.87 and so on, assuming stock stays flat. 


However if stock goes up so does interest rate and so do odds of being right and being able to buy back to close at a lower price. So they can change their mind and close by buying now. They want to close ASAP so buy whatever they can get. Stock goes up even more, screwing other short sellers.

But I’m skeptical about GMEs e-commerce revenues. This year especially with COVID and e-commerce killing it.

I’m a retard that works part time at a resale shop that buys and sells video games. One phenomenon that’s happened is almost every video game and console ever made jumped in demand and price. We are abnormally sold out on a lot of video game merch..

For example, a year ago GME was selling Xbox 360s for $50 with a 100% mail in rebate. Basically giving them away for free. We even had a hard time selling them. But now we can barely keep em in stock @ $70 

Also We used to sell Original Wii’s @ $50 a pop. Now we can’t keep in the store for $80. 

Look at pricecharting .com and search any game/console. The graphs shows prices over the last 5/10 years.

Basically People are going nuts for games right now. But when Covids over, And government checks stop flying, I have a hard time believing these prices and volume of sales will continue. 

I do think GMEs future is in solid leadership and an Amazon Prime subscription type approach. But I really don’t know to what extent. If E-commerce is the way, they’ll have to expand what they sell. GME makes no money with new games/consols. all their revenue comes from pre-owned games/consoles. 

I know they have a subscription platform & offer higher payouts with it. But If they can heavily discount the preowned stock with, they will be on to something. But I don’t know if that will 100% do the trick.

822,GME,"OK while I agree with some of the general sentiment, the analysis is clearly MAJORLY flawed.

You talk about the business being an ecommerce/growth business with $5bn revenue.

Even if GME is making this pivot at the moment, 90+% of this would be in the bricks and mortar portion. So you have <10% which has growth prospects. The other 90% is flat and/or declining.

I agree that Gamestop's biggest competitive advantage is it's brand name and capital which it should be able to use to scale much more rapidly than a startup growing from scratch, but it's foolish to expect the whole business can pivot like that. That's not how it works - it will have a small division which slowly grows, and its that portion of the company that you should be evaluating when you're throwing figures out, not the revenue of the whole company.

The picture is nowhere near as bleak as the shorters would have you believe, but to your point re: execution, the picture is NOWHERE near as rosy as you're arguing either. Any business is able to pivot if they want, the ability to execute is another story altogether",0.033,0.857,0.111,0.8367

My plan would then be to wait until it drops again, for the sake of this I'll say buy back 1000 shares at $50/share = $50k (leaving $80k for taxes and reinvesting.

Also, the fact that GME will be selling PC hardware as well is big. Sure there's probably gonna be a markup vs buying on Newegg, but if they're smart, they'll have smart staff available to help less tech-savvy buyers put together PCs, making that another solid revenue stream.

Have a rotating stock of pcs that would be rented/bought then traded in whole or partially upgraded and then resold or rented to individuals/families that find 2-3 hundy price point more feasible.

Even have a separate higher end section of the business to drive attention like a car company produces its higher end sport models to create brand recognition.

>24k is a lot of money to a lot of people

This is...reductionist? Maybe not. Regardless, those two statements have absolutely nothing to do with each other and are not mutually exclusive. 24k could change a homeless person's life, but if we compared everything we did and everything we felt to someone who was worse off we'd dismiss every problem and issue in our lives because someone always has it worse and that would be an absolutely horrible thing to do to yourself.

Because in retrospect, a person who lives on welfare by themselves with shitty healthcare because of their income status and, say $5k in debt for example, may never be able to pay off their debt with a high interest rate. $24k would solve all their problems! But swap their life for one with a full time job making almost $35 an hour with both $15k in debt he put himself in when he was young and naive, AND $60k in debt he did not put himself in but his parents did because they were pieces of shit, all with high interest rates that paying the minimums are a lifetime of 1/3 of his paycheck gone every month. He has to take care of 2 families he's related to because he loves them, sees how they're trying to better themselves and with success until COVID, and he's the only one with the means to help or else he'd be a sociopath letting them get evicted and become homeless (and I've already had the ""that's their problem, you're not responsible for their problems"" argument, but the non-hesitant inhumanity of it is absolutely and absurdly abhorrent). Oh, and, no one has health insurance because they ""make too much"" to qualify for assistance while not being able to afford their entire rent for one month, let alone an extra expense. Between those two lives? Id rather be the dude on welfare that 24k could fix his problems.

Someone always has it worse, someone always has it better, it's ridiculous to always constantly worry about how some other person you imagined has it worse. I am not pretending 24k is small, I am very grateful and proud of what I've built. It will not help me at the moment, but add 40k to it and I suddenly have over $800 more a month after taxes to start contributing towards building a future. I have already been over my options with what I have. For now it's best where it's at so it can grow until it, hopefully, bails me out of what has been my entire life up to this point.

1336,UK,"For those asking whether Trading 212 in the UK are loaning out your shares and what to do about it;

TLDR:

1. Use the ISA instead of invest and then they don't
2. Use limit orders and then they can't

Full details:

A) Yes by default they do it: *""We will loan out some of the shares we hold on your behalf, and we will earn a modest amount of interest on that which will help us maintain a sustainable commission-free model. Share lending will be executed only for Invest accounts""*

B) You can disable it, but then they'll charge you commission on trades: *""To benefit from free commission going forwards you will have to sign up to the share lending program.""*

C) But they don't loan shares if you are using an ISA: *""Shares held in an ISA will not be lent out, and are excluded from the program.""*

D) If you don't have the ability to switch from invest to ISA, you can as other people have pointed out, set a sell limit order to prevent the broker from being able to lend them out, but play with the team and set a high limit order. REEEEALLLLY high. If we get a squeeze and you want to sell you can just amend the limit order to the (then) going rate.

1357,GME,"The most basic is - Shorting is borrowing a stock with the promise of giving it back later.

When you short, you're borrowing a stock and selling it at the current price.  You'll have to give that stock back at some point, so if the price goes down and you close your position, then you're giving the stock back to the broker and pocketing the difference in stock price.  If it went up, you'll be paying the difference.

This is the basis for the squeeze.  In order to close the position the shorts have to buy the stock in order to give it back to the broker.  Supply and demand drives price up.  Taking a short position also drives the price down since it's the equivalent of selling.

If no shares are available to cover the position, prices go up.  Hence the squeeze.  GME is way over shorted.  If your broker is lending shares, then Short sellers have stocks to borrow to double down and drive price down instead of being forced to buy to cover their position.

Brand recognition, loyal customers, and an upcoming transition into digital gaming combined with a niche for the physical stores to pivot into make this a sure thing. Short squeeze on top of that makes $300 a very reasonable target.

Looking back at previous short squeezes, I don't think there has **ever** been one where short interest was 140% of float. Even the VWO squeeze in 2008 was only about 15% short interest (even though almost all shares were spoken for).

This next month will be rocky, which is why I only have about 10% in ITM options. Shares are the play on this one.

A stock isn't a good short candidate if a) it's already shorted to hell, b) it's already trading at a sizeable discount to future cash flows, and big bad c) just because it's increased in price.

Shorts who came in at $20 made a huge and classic mistake thinking a stock that has appreciated 500% in 6 or 8 months *has* to go back down.

I think Citron established a short that is already significantly underwater, and they're desperate to push this back down to cover at a smaller loss.

The Tweet wording is extremely telling.  They're trying to scare everyone that GME is an enormous gamble and will fall right back to $20 in days.

Longs please don't do stupid things. Learn from the experienced members. If short term winning/losing money is important to you, don't go all in with full margin. Have a plan, take advantage of the manipulators. Buy low.

1667,GME,"When you want sushi, do you think “ahh I’ll just go trader joes, they must have the best prepacked sushi available” or do you go down the street to a restaurant called Shinjuku Sushi?

I went to best buy and Walmart for PS5s and they didn’t even have displays set up and said they’ll get no irl stock, yet their online sales weren’t spectacular at all. All GME stores had waitlists of 100 people since they literally said no more waitlists. 

They’re still the #1 store to go to for exclusive edition console launches such as the animal crossing switch. Brand value is still up there, and there are still a ton of people who buy physical. I own a switch and all my games are physical. 

I’m literally autistic like everyone else but I do believe that GME could shake up the digital market since no new innovation has really happened besides the XBOX game pass in the digital space since steam. Microsoft (who is now pushing digital insanely hard) investing and partnering with GME shows signs of a future that is way brighter than What the boomers are saying (blockbuster toys r us) 

If toys r us can be bought out and stay alive in Canada without any major shakeups, then I think GameStop under Cohen with Microsoft deal can get back to previous stock prices. 

Microsoft is RICH, but would they really give GME a cut of all digital console store sales if they didn’t think they had the potential to MOVE CONSOLES? so the foot traffic and sales are definitely substantial, even in the coming years to warrant a move like that. 

I don’t think GME will be absolutely gigantic, but if a freaking goddamn online pet shop can have 45b valuation (and only available in the US) then I think GME can freaking break $50...

Again, nobody really is lining up at Walmart to buy the latest call of duty

Edit: my positions are 160 shares GME at avg price of 26.2, even if the shorts and paper hands fuck everyone over since the SEC rule has now ended, I still think the price will go higher than now in a year or two with the new changes they’re looking to bring.

My two cents: 

IMO the point that could be highlighted a bit better is showing the evolution of the physical/digital game split (industry wide) and how you project it down the line and subsequent impact on revenue. I will only look at gross revenue since Cohen seems to be very tight on cost control so ***let's*** assume that will be a positive. 

If I look at Nintendo, 2020 is 68/32 for physical/digital split, with upwards trend in favor of digital. Yet it is not clear how you project the split going forward and how that translates into your expected cash flow on game sales.

Refering to TabCohen GME, A147;H151)

If I'm reading correctly, you are projecting game sales to increase even though the trend is for physical game sales to decline? The growth is phenomenal..? IMO the whole bear case revolves around this point and ideally the DD should be crystal on why this is mitigated.

Problems:

\- They assume that the 2024 numbers are steady in those bear/normal cases, and value accordingly as steady state cash flows, when they aren't confronting the long-term elimination of disks and need to migrate businesses.

\- They are assuming 2021 will be profitable. That's not in the bag. A bear case would say no.

Their bear case is a bull case, and their normal and bull cases are uber bull cases.

Not impossible, but the logic is very flawed. The large one is simply using a 2024 valuation as 'stable' and applying a mutliplier. With a declining business category, you actually have to use very small multiples. So really, the only hope here is if they migrate to new business model that is better. OR, they can just boost margins and dividend out a lot, which is the original value thesis.

The true bear case here is - disks slide off over the coming years, leaving gamestop with the bag on leases they didn't roll, and muting the benefit of eCommerce migration. Then either their business pivots are ineffective and lose money. They are not modeling that here. Not super far off from their base case, but showing a multiple as if it's stable for the coming 30 years is the problem.

Were I writing this fairly, I think I'd use their bull case as is with a little trimming, then present a bear case which is bankruptcy/financial distress and share price $1 or less by 2024. That's really what this stock is at this point - up or down a lot. 

Puts are still implying a 30% chance of BK or financial distress by 2023.... And those are in high demand by bond holders who do sociopathically weight all the possible outcomes.

2055,GME,"Short squeeze is an exciting possibility. 

But anyone saying GME is a long hold has little to no experience actually interacting with the video game market, as a consumer I mean. 

PC gamers do not use GameStop. The majority of people who want to build their PC will not build their PC at GameStop. These people build PCs generally to save money on the parts. There's a small niche of people who think they want to build a PC think they want to be elite PC gamers but aren't going to go for the trouble of doing it entirely on their own - GameStop will fill that relatively small void by giving them the illusion they're not buying a pre-made PC. 

PC gamers get their games from steam and to a lesser degree from publishers directly, and that's if they're not playing free to play games. There is no realistic way forward for GameStop becoming a digital reseller in any meaningful way - no one, certainly not consumers, has any financial incentive to help that happen. 

Consoles are going discless and, tbh, I think all but a few extreme fans who want to wait on a line on release day and get super ultra editions already hated GameStop before consoles went discless. I hated GameStop. I still hate GameStop as a video gamer. They are exactly the kind of middle man that ought to be phased out by more efficient market structures and competitors like steam that have a three hundred miles head start. 

I'm excited about the short squeeze. Let's 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 to the moon. But as far as long term prospects, I have no faith. I agree GameStop probably has several more years before collapsing - primarily something that will be achieved by closing their brick and mortar stores (and of course relying on the batshit hyper pumped insano bubble were currently in). But surviving is not the same as thriving, and every iota of real world exposure to the video gaming market that I have tells me there is no realistic way for GameStop to thrive in the mid to long term.

Edit: look, do I hope I'm wrong and the tendies come flowing in like the river nile for all eternity, GME to $1500, next amazon of pc parts and digital distribution? Fuck yeah. Do I think that'll happen - nope. 

Although, one way out for GameStop in the long haul is just outright purchase by one of the major gaming players - perhaps If the Microsoft deal goes well and the stock gets low enough you could see an acquisition.",0.105,0.752,0.143,0.9129

If you exercise one call option, you will buy 100 shares for $10 = $1,000. The premium you paid was $83, so you'll have paid $1,083 or $10.83 a share for 100 shares. The shares will immediately be worth $1,253 (6pm extended hours final price) for a profit of $170.

If you sell to close you will get $246 (1 x 100 x $2.46), which you spent $83 on for a total profit of $163 - and also not spend $1,000 for a total value of $1,246.

Good ramp at 17.5... would start to kick in like now. That's 128k gamma, so 11-12m shares purchased on a solid move, on 146m float, will cause a solid move. Not a ton of movement past 18.5 from options, would need normal BS special acquisition vehicle hype.",0.0,0.746,0.254,0.9136

2598,AT,"Not a lot of gamma ramp. 78m shares floating, gamma will only cause AT MOST  4m of buying, but more likely 3m, on the path to like $13. If you wanted to speculate, $10 looks better. But you really need the earnings to go well. Gamma won't help much, you need genuine buyers.",0.047,0.768,0.185,0.8158

2600,OI,"I do not think MMs are going to do that, not a lot of OI expiring Friday. Their play is more likely to wait for shorts to show up, and make money loaning them shares while sitting on this all. MMs are fundamentally risk averse and keep it simple if they can. They just want to collect rent on their strategies.

    In one rocket

    Or just let it slip?

    knees weak, losses are heavy 
    There's bear shit on his sweater already, much regretti 
    He's nervous, on the surface he looks retarded but ready 
    To drop more $$ but he keeps on forgettin' 
    What we called down, the audist DD goes so loud 
    He opens his account, but the gains won't come out 
    He's chokin', how, gaybears Jokin' now 
    The shorts run out, mar-ket’s over, blaow 
    Snap back to reality, ope 
    there goes GME Ope, 
    there goes Melvin, he choked 
    Rockets so mad, but they won't 
    give up that easy? No 
    They won't have it, Melv' knows 
    his whole back's to these ropes 
    It don't matter, he's dope, 
    he knows but, tards are broke 
    Stock's so stagnant, we know, 
    when he goes back to his mobile phone, that's when it's 
    Back to-red-dit again, yo, 
    this whole tragedy Better go capture this moment and hope it don't
    You better 
    lose yourself in the DeeDees, the crayons 
    You own it, you better never not yolo (yo)
    You only get one stock, do not miss your chance to blow 
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime,-
    You better lose yourself in the gamestop,

    WallStreetBets,
    If you had 
    One stock

    To YOLO everything you ever needed 
    In one rocket 
    Would you diamond hand it 
    Or just let it slip?
    Yo
    ‘tards’ palms are sweaty, 
    knees weak, losses are heavy 
    There's bear shit on his sweater already, much regretti 
    He's nervous, on the surface he looks retarded but ready 
    To drop more $$ but he keeps on forgettin' 
    What we called down, the audist DD goes so loud 
    He opens his account, but the gains won't come out 
    He's chokin', how, gaybears Jokin' now 
    The shorts run out, mar-ket’s over, blaow 
    Snap back to reality, ope 
    there goes GME Ope, 
    there goes Melvin, he choked 
    Rockets so mad, but they won't 
    give up that easy? No 
    They won't have it, Melv' knows 
    his whole back's to these ropes 
    It don't matter, he's dope, 
    he knows but, tards are broke 
    Stock's so stagnant, we know, 
    when he goes back to his mobile phone, that's when it's 
    Back to-red-dit again, yo, 
    this whole tragedy Better go capture this moment and hope it don't

2836,GME,"everyone in the gang can feel you

a friend of mine who i successfully converted wanted to sell on wednesday when the price rocket up so hard. he asked me for advice if he should hold or buy and i told him ""i am not in GME for measily 100-150% profits""

it peaked on $38 and went back to $31 - he lost faith but of course he HOLD onto it

now look today, we have kinda strong support at $40 and peaked at $45 (new 52week high) - we will look back in a couple weeks and laugh about this abnormally low price and would buy for $50 INSTANTLY. (just like we would buy for 25 right now but back on last monday it would seem ridiculous)

this whole setup is like a giant pile of horse shit which just needs a little push in form of news from our god cohen or something remotely comparable

and remember: if EVERYTHING goes wrong we possibly hit rock bottom (i dont really believe in this) the best strategy is the same...

Some brokerages might allow it (I don't know of any), but generally it's pretty discouraged for a few reasons: it's unnecessary competition to buying on margin (but it's bad competition because the interest rates on CCs are much worse than margin rates), FINRA severely limits the amount you can fund with borrowed money, and it's unnecessarily risky.  


That said, a creative person can find ways. The easiest is to use your CC to pay yourself via PayPal and then transfer that payment to your regular bank account(s).

I can now pay off my remaining $60k student loan balance and then some. but guess what .... I’M STILL NOT FUCKING SELLING TILL THIS SHIT SQUEEZES TO THE MOON!! 🥜🥜🥜🚀🚀🚀🚀

I fucking hate citron more than cancer, but no matter what it seems, there is at the very least 'temporary' pain involved when they open their fat mouths. Expect bleeding tomorrow.",0.286,0.606,0.108,-0.9779

3016,GME,"Look kid. 

You would be 100% dumb to bet your student loan on GME.

Regardless of how much you try to rationalize it, it is about as dumb a thing you can do right now.

Try your hardest in school to get a good degree to make money out of school. Get the best job you can. Save and invest then (in your own business if you can; stonks if not). Then do the best you can to increase your income each year.

That's how you become a success. Not following retards on here. No joke. Not making fun of you. 

Good luck. The last four years under Trump are not going to be the same as you will experience under Biden. You are just too young to understand.",0.075,0.738,0.187,0.9524

Are you in the right place? Yes.

Is it fiscally responsible to use student loan at this price level? No.

PS. Consider this: I'm an adult with two degrees, no loans, savings and a stable job. I'm in position to gamble my savings away. You're not. In contrary to popular belief, squeeze play is risky and uncertain time wise. Roaring kitty breaks it down on youtube. Good luck.",0.136,0.616,0.248,0.9095
