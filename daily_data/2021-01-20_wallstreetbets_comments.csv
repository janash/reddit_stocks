# FAQ

1. Does this work?
   1. No fucking clue, I just wrote it between doing real work.
2. How do I use this?
   1. When you run this it starts a flask server with two endpoints. Send json data using PUT with e.g. requests to /start\_yolo\_alarm which should be {""username"": MY\_ROBINHOOD\_USERNAME, ""password"": MY\_ROBINHOOD\_PASSWORD, ""wakeup\_time"": WHEN\_MY\_ALARM\_SHOULD\_GO\_OFF}
   2. You wakeup you need to have a command that hits /disable with a GET, if you put this in a QR code you can just click the link from your phone app!
   3. If you don't know how to send HTTP requests to things you shouldn't be using this.
3. Can you run this for me?

# Retard FAQ

**Is it too late to buy???**

No

**I bought shares at $38, should I sell today since I heard there's going to be a dip?**

Definitely not.  If anything you need to buy more.  Selling your shares actually helps the hedge funds on the other side of this stock play.

**Should I buy on margin?**

No.  This again helps the hedge funds.

**But it’s bouncing around $42 and I didn’t get in at $36 and now I’m in the red and—**

*lays hand on forehead .* My child, very soon none of these little ups and downs are going to matter.  Try to imagine if you'd bought in at $4 and it dropped to $2 earlier this year, would the stress of that change mean anything to you today if you had gotten in that early?

**What’s happening? :c**

[7 minute video describing what a short squeeze is](https://youtu.be/XAyaQaWajpI) \- VERY good

[10 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iPUqCw1Skc) \- compares this GME short squeeze to the last mother of all short squeezes (MOASS) in 2008 with VW

**But my mom read an apple news article and is saying it’s for sure going to $20!!?**

Straight up this is the signal that they’re getting so desperate they’re actually trying coordinated efforts to scare people to sell right now.  Don’t be a 🌈 🐻 and believe these jackasses.  NUMBERS DONT LIE.  When you see a sudden uptick in random people just spreading fear and doubt without anything to back it up, they're just little bootlicking bitches.  We're right, and they're depending on us listening to them and not being our retard selves and ignoring institutional advice that only serves these hedge funds.

Their announcement of an announcement that of a livestream for 5 reasons why GME is going to $20 came within 60 seconds of \~1 million shares being shorted yesterday.  These were two coordinated, bold faced efforts to drive the stock down after a 25% bull run to $45 because the pain was too much for them.  It's even better because they couldn't even drive it down below $37.  Losers.

**Okay, when do I buy?**

Today, Wednesday 1/20, the institutional assholes that are trying to weasel out of their bullshit play are trying to suppress stock today to save themselves which is hilarious to me because they made the biggest mistake ever by telling us the date and time when they are going to do this.  📄🤲pussies will fall for this and sell, but not you.  You're going to buy that dip and hold.

**Okay, but WHEN do I buy?  What price should I go in on??**

My personal philosophy, backed up by [another amazing DD pos](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/)t by u/FatAspirations, is that you're thinking like a trader and fussing over a few dollars of volatility when you need to be thinking like a venture capitalist who just needs to get in at *all*.  I'm in for 13K right now, another 5K is getting deposited this morning and you know what?  I'm going to buy today at 11:30am EST no matter what the price is to give the bird to these institutional asshats that have continued to work over the good and honest retard for decades because I know it doesn't matter if I go in at 15, 30, 60 dollars.  The insane short squeeze we are about to witness dwarfs any ups and downs while we're still sitting at a steal of $30-some dollars.

**Okay, I'm in, but when do I sell?  How high will this go?**

I'm just a humble retard, but I say this in earnest: the answers lie within you.  By this I mean *whenever we decide to sell*.  If we want to sell at $420.69, we could, but I feel like that's lacking imagination for a short squeeze.  We have the high ground.  We have a highly motivated group of bright eyed autists who are ride or die GME and are *anticipating* *and* *understand* this squeeze.  These short sellers have no control right now and are *bleeding*, we can literally sell at $1,000 or $3,200 per share once the bloodshed starts.  To the moon?  I'm riding this rocket to friggin' Saturn.  $5,000 per share.

**$5,000?  Really...?  That seems...high.**

Some of you are in disbelief we could get to 5 grand.  Let me say this again: the share holders have the power here.  The share is water, we're in the Sahara desert, these little milk toast billionaires are coming up to you begging for a liter of water for $100 after they made you lose your house over a liter of water in 2008, screwed your wife, and took a shit on your dog.  No.  Maybe we want $1,000 for that liter of water.  Maybe **FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A LITER.  We know you can afford it Melvin.**

**How far down do you predict the dip will get to?**

* If you're trying to optimize your buy to catch an extra buck-- [see this amazing DD post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) about treating this as a capital venture instead of a trade.

Big reward requires big balls my friends, we take -50% dips in stride and just. keep.

We came pretty damn close yesterday.

**Okay yeah yeah, but are there actually enough of us to buy enough shares to make this squeeze happen?**

The short sellers have been practicing naked short selling for almost a month and a half now, meaning they've shorted more shares than actually exist in the market.  So the answer actually is: ""we already have"".  All of this edging up to 40 and backing off is just going to make this epic cash-filled climax of GME sausage that much longer and intense.

**Okay yeah yeah, but are there actually enough of us to buy enough shares to make this squeeze happen?**

The short sellers have been practicing naked short selling for almost a month and a half now, meaning they've shorted more shares than actually exist in the market.  So the answer actually is: ""we already have"".  All of this edging up to 40 and backing off is just going to make this epic cash-filled climax of GME sausage that much longer and intense.

# Retard FAQ

**Is it too late to buy???**

No

**I bought shares at $38, should I sell today since I heard there's going to be a dip?**

Definitely not.  If anything you need to buy more.  Selling your shares actually helps the hedge funds on the other side of this stock play.

**Should I buy on margin?**

No.  This again helps the hedge funds.

**But it’s bouncing around $42 and I didn’t get in at $36 and now I’m in the red and—**

*lays hand on forehead .* My child, very soon none of these little ups and downs are going to matter.  Try to imagine if you'd bought in at $4 and it dropped to $2 earlier this year, would the stress of that change mean anything to you today if you had gotten in that early?

**What’s happening? :c**

[7 minute video describing what a short squeeze is](https://youtu.be/XAyaQaWajpI) \- VERY good

[10 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iPUqCw1Skc) \- compares this GME short squeeze to the last mother of all short squeezes (MOASS) in 2008 with VW

**But my mom read an apple news article and is saying it’s for sure going to $20!!?**

Straight up this is the signal that they’re getting so desperate they’re actually trying coordinated efforts to scare people to sell right now.  Don’t be a 🌈 🐻 and believe these jackasses.  NUMBERS DONT LIE.  When you see a sudden uptick in random people just spreading fear and doubt without anything to back it up, they're just little bootlicking bitches.  We're right, and they're depending on us listening to them and not being our retard selves and ignoring institutional advice that only serves these hedge funds.

Their announcement of an announcement that of a livestream for 5 reasons why GME is going to $20 came within 60 seconds of \~1 million shares being shorted yesterday.  These were two coordinated, bold faced efforts to drive the stock down after a 25% bull run to $45 because the pain was too much for them.  It's even better because they couldn't even drive it down below $37.  Losers.

**Okay, when do I buy?**

Today, Wednesday 1/20, the institutional assholes that are trying to weasel out of their bullshit play are trying to suppress stock today to save themselves which is hilarious to me because they made the biggest mistake ever by telling us the date and time when they are going to do this.  📄🤲pussies will fall for this and sell, but not you.  You're going to buy that dip and hold.

**Okay, but WHEN do I buy?  What price should I go in on??**

My personal philosophy, backed up by [another amazing DD pos](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/)t by u/FatAspirations, is that you're thinking like a trader and fussing over a few dollars of volatility when you need to be thinking like a venture capitalist who just needs to get in at *all*.  I'm in for 13K right now, another 5K is getting deposited this morning and you know what?  I'm going to buy today at 11:30am EST no matter what the price is to give the bird to these institutional asshats that have continued to work over the good and honest retard for decades because I know it doesn't matter if I go in at 15, 30, 60 dollars.  The insane short squeeze we are about to witness dwarfs any ups and downs while we're still sitting at a steal of $30-some dollars.

**Okay, I'm in, but when do I sell?  How high will this go?**

I'm just a humble retard, but I say this in earnest: the answers lie within you.  By this I mean *whenever we decide to sell*.  If we want to sell at $420.69, we could, but I feel like that's lacking imagination for a short squeeze.  We have the high ground.  We have a highly motivated group of bright eyed autists who are ride or die GME and are *anticipating* *and* *understand* this squeeze.  These short sellers have no control right now and are *bleeding*, we can literally sell at $1,000 or $3,200 per share once the bloodshed starts.  To the moon?  I'm riding this rocket to friggin' Saturn.  $5,000 per share.

**$5,000?  Really...?  That seems...high.**

Some of you are in disbelief we could get to 5 grand.  Let me say this again: the share holders have the power here.  The share is water, we're in the Sahara desert, these little milk toast billionaires are coming up to you begging for a liter of water for $100 after they made you lose your house over a liter of water in 2008, screwed your wife, and took a shit on your dog.  No.  Maybe we want $1,000 for that liter of water.  Maybe **FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A LITER.  We know you can afford it Melvin.**

**How far down do you predict the dip will get to?**

* If you're trying to optimize your buy to catch an extra buck-- [see this amazing DD post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) about treating this as a capital venture instead of a trade.

They’re shady as fuck and have been wrong on almost all of their “professional opinions” on stocks—they are just short selling market manipulators looking to deceive the public with another one of their scams. 

WSB has a lot of people who have bought stock, but there aren’t abject falsehoods being posted about GME. There aren’t blatant deceptive tactics from promoters like with penny stock pump n dumps. There’s nothing illegal about fucking over the short sellers by seeking a profit. I am invested in GME because I want to make money.

700,GME,"Because eventually the cost of borrowing stock (to short sell) will overcome the value of the gains the short sellers could have by GME crashing. 


Say they borrowed at 30 to sell. So they’re up $30. They pay interest on market price. So as it rises to $40 ish for a bit, they pay more interest. The rate also increased from probably a low 10% to 50% to probably 100% or something. 


So now they are after 1mo paying let’s say 80% interest on $38 avg price, equal to $2.58. 


They had +$30, now -$2.58 = $27.42. Profit. 

If it takes another month then profit drops to 24.87 and so on, assuming stock stays flat. 


However if stock goes up so does interest rate and so do odds of being right and being able to buy back to close at a lower price. So they can change their mind and close by buying now. They want to close ASAP so buy whatever they can get. Stock goes up even more, screwing other short sellers.

But I’m skeptical about GMEs e-commerce revenues. This year especially with COVID and e-commerce killing it.

I’m a retard that works part time at a resale shop that buys and sells video games. One phenomenon that’s happened is almost every video game and console ever made jumped in demand and price. We are abnormally sold out on a lot of video game merch..

For example, a year ago GME was selling Xbox 360s for $50 with a 100% mail in rebate. Basically giving them away for free. We even had a hard time selling them. But now we can barely keep em in stock @ $70 

Also We used to sell Original Wii’s @ $50 a pop. Now we can’t keep in the store for $80. 

Look at pricecharting .com and search any game/console. The graphs shows prices over the last 5/10 years.

Basically People are going nuts for games right now. But when Covids over, And government checks stop flying, I have a hard time believing these prices and volume of sales will continue. 

I do think GMEs future is in solid leadership and an Amazon Prime subscription type approach. But I really don’t know to what extent. If E-commerce is the way, they’ll have to expand what they sell. GME makes no money with new games/consols. all their revenue comes from pre-owned games/consoles. 

I know they have a subscription platform & offer higher payouts with it. But If they can heavily discount the preowned stock with, they will be on to something. But I don’t know if that will 100% do the trick.

Red flag right there. If you're a VC and you're learning from WSB, you probably should disclose that to your LPs. 

On to the crux of your thesis: 

1. Ryan Cohen has a golden dick. 
2. GME will be the Costco/Amazon of gaming. 

On 1: perhaps. Or perhaps being already a near-billionaire at 35, he'll be more distracted getting that golden dick polished than he will be interested in growing it.

On 2: People go to Costco every week for groceries. They buy other stuff while they are there, in a giant warehouse of cool stuff. People will not go to GameStop every week or even every month. There is no ""Costco of Gaming"". As for the ""Amazon of Gaming""? Pretty sure Amazon already has ideas about being the ""Amazon of Gaming"". Leverage that Prime sub. Now, maybe it's not in Amazon's DNA to execute, but that's a big bet.

TL;DR: the risks are a lot greater than you seem to believe.",0.056,0.858,0.086,0.3619

Add to that the continuing rumors of online trade-ins being a thing in the future, and I can definitely see digital being an asset for GME rather than a competitor.

Also, the fact that GME will be selling PC hardware as well is big. Sure there's probably gonna be a markup vs buying on Newegg, but if they're smart, they'll have smart staff available to help less tech-savvy buyers put together PCs, making that another solid revenue stream.

>24k is a lot of money to a lot of people

This is...reductionist? Maybe not. Regardless, those two statements have absolutely nothing to do with each other and are not mutually exclusive. 24k could change a homeless person's life, but if we compared everything we did and everything we felt to someone who was worse off we'd dismiss every problem and issue in our lives because someone always has it worse and that would be an absolutely horrible thing to do to yourself.

Because in retrospect, a person who lives on welfare by themselves with shitty healthcare because of their income status and, say $5k in debt for example, may never be able to pay off their debt with a high interest rate. $24k would solve all their problems! But swap their life for one with a full time job making almost $35 an hour with both $15k in debt he put himself in when he was young and naive, AND $60k in debt he did not put himself in but his parents did because they were pieces of shit, all with high interest rates that paying the minimums are a lifetime of 1/3 of his paycheck gone every month. He has to take care of 2 families he's related to because he loves them, sees how they're trying to better themselves and with success until COVID, and he's the only one with the means to help or else he'd be a sociopath letting them get evicted and become homeless (and I've already had the ""that's their problem, you're not responsible for their problems"" argument, but the non-hesitant inhumanity of it is absolutely and absurdly abhorrent). Oh, and, no one has health insurance because they ""make too much"" to qualify for assistance while not being able to afford their entire rent for one month, let alone an extra expense. Between those two lives? Id rather be the dude on welfare that 24k could fix his problems.

Someone always has it worse, someone always has it better, it's ridiculous to always constantly worry about how some other person you imagined has it worse. I am not pretending 24k is small, I am very grateful and proud of what I've built. It will not help me at the moment, but add 40k to it and I suddenly have over $800 more a month after taxes to start contributing towards building a future. I have already been over my options with what I have. For now it's best where it's at so it can grow until it, hopefully, bails me out of what has been my entire life up to this point.

""A s most of you know, my name is Andrew Left and I have been publishing  under the Stocklemon.com and now CitronResearch.com banners for over 6  years.

1388,UK,"For those asking whether Trading 212 in the UK are loaning out your shares and what to do about it;

TLDR:

1. Use the ISA instead of invest and then they don't
2. Use limit orders and then they can't

Full details:

A) Yes by default they do it: *""We will loan out some of the shares we hold on your behalf, and we will earn a modest amount of interest on that which will help us maintain a sustainable commission-free model. Share lending will be executed only for Invest accounts""*

B) You can disable it, but then they'll charge you commission on trades: *""To benefit from free commission going forwards you will have to sign up to the share lending program.""*

C) But they don't loan shares if you are using an ISA: *""Shares held in an ISA will not be lent out, and are excluded from the program.""*

D) If you don't have the ability to switch from invest to ISA, you can as other people have pointed out, set a sell limit order to prevent the broker from being able to lend them out, but play with the team and set a high limit order. REEEEALLLLY high. If we get a squeeze and you want to sell you can just amend the limit order to the (then) going rate.

1410,GME,"The most basic is - Shorting is borrowing a stock with the promise of giving it back later.

When you short, you're borrowing a stock and selling it at the current price.  You'll have to give that stock back at some point, so if the price goes down and you close your position, then you're giving the stock back to the broker and pocketing the difference in stock price.  If it went up, you'll be paying the difference.

This is the basis for the squeeze.  In order to close the position the shorts have to buy the stock in order to give it back to the broker.  Supply and demand drives price up.  Taking a short position also drives the price down since it's the equivalent of selling.

If no shares are available to cover the position, prices go up.  Hence the squeeze.  GME is way over shorted.  If your broker is lending shares, then Short sellers have stocks to borrow to double down and drive price down instead of being forced to buy to cover their position.

Short squeeze on top of that makes $300 a very reasonable target.

Looking back at previous short squeezes, I don't think there has **ever** been one where short interest was 140% of float. Even the VWO squeeze in 2008 was only about 15% short interest (even though almost all shares were spoken for).

My two cents: 

IMO the point that could be highlighted a bit better is showing the evolution of the physical/digital game split (industry wide) and how you project it down the line and subsequent impact on revenue. I will only look at gross revenue since Cohen seems to be very tight on cost control so ***let's*** assume that will be a positive. 

If I look at Nintendo, 2020 is 68/32 for physical/digital split, with upwards trend in favor of digital. Yet it is not clear how you project the split going forward and how that translates into your expected cash flow on game sales.

If I'm reading correctly, you are projecting game sales to increase even though the trend is for physical game sales to decline? The growth is phenomenal..? IMO the whole bear case revolves around this point and ideally the DD should be crystal on why this is mitigated.

To check if a securities analysis makes sense, first check the assumptions in the model. Those are wrong here.

Problems:

\- They assume that the 2024 numbers are steady in those bear/normal cases, and value accordingly as steady state cash flows, when they aren't confronting the long-term elimination of disks and need to migrate businesses. The base assumption of cash flows is that they grow at the rate of the economy. We know physical disks eventually go away, and GME has to migrate. But these numbers assume they do not, and in fact, stop declining and start growing at the rate of the economy at the end of the forecast. You have to use a different, much lower multiple to value declining earnings streams. They didn't do this properly. TLDR, you can't apply a 9x exit multiple to a profit stream that is declining. You could apply a big multiple to a growing multiple. They also apply this as a straight multiple to all profits, but some are more valuable as long-term properties than others.

\- They are assuming 2021 will be profitable and thus the company will not have to raise capital or have bankruptcy risk in any of these scenarios. That's not in the bag. A bear case would say no, and a modest case would suggest these growth ambitions require a cap raise.

\- Across all of these, they assume no dilution will occur. It will occur just from stock options. It also will occur from the need to raise capital to do more ambitious growth plans.

These flawed assumptions make the analysis crap. Garbage in, garbage out. There is a bull case for GME around transformation of revenue streams along with ecommerce tilt. But it's hard to trust this analysis when it has so many underlying problems on the bear/mid cases.

I would add that long-term puts at $3-$5 are still implying a 30% chance of BK or financial distress by 2023, which means market participants are pricing a real threat of $0.  A bear case should include this as a possibility if it's being honest.",0.095,0.799,0.106,0.7477

1655,GME,"Short squeeze is an exciting possibility. 

But anyone saying GME is a long hold has little to no experience actually interacting with the video game market, as a consumer I mean. 

PC gamers do not use GameStop. The majority of people who want to build their PC will not build their PC at GameStop. These people build PCs generally to save money on the parts. There's a small niche of people who think they want to build a PC think they want to be elite PC gamers but aren't going to go for the trouble of doing it entirely on their own - GameStop will fill that relatively small void by giving them the illusion they're not buying a pre-made PC. 

PC gamers get their games from steam and to a lesser degree from publishers directly, and that's if they're not playing free to play games. There is no realistic way forward for GameStop becoming a digital reseller in any meaningful way - no one, certainly not consumers, has any financial incentive to help that happen. 

Consoles are going discless and, tbh, I think all but a few extreme fans who want to wait on a line on release day and get super ultra editions already hated GameStop before consoles went discless. I hated GameStop. I still hate GameStop as a video gamer. They are exactly the kind of middle man that ought to be phased out by more efficient market structures and competitors like steam that have a three hundred miles head start. 

I'm excited about the short squeeze. Let's 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 to the moon. But as far as long term prospects, I have no faith. I agree GameStop probably has several more years before collapsing - primarily something that will be achieved by closing their brick and mortar stores (and of course relying on the batshit hyper pumped insano bubble were currently in). But surviving is not the same as thriving, and every iota of real world exposure to the video gaming market that I have tells me there is no realistic way for GameStop to thrive in the mid to long term.

Edit: look, do I hope I'm wrong and the tendies come flowing in like the river nile for all eternity, GME to $1500, next amazon of pc parts and digital distribution? Fuck yeah. Do I think that'll happen - nope. 

Although, one way out for GameStop in the long haul is just outright purchase by one of the major gaming players - perhaps If the Microsoft deal goes well and the stock gets low enough you could see an acquisition.",0.105,0.752,0.143,0.9129

>Our bear case is presented to model the current trajectory of the business under the existing plan and management. Even in this case, there is clear profitability for years.

The problem is, it's total fucking bullshit and a one eyed lemur could see through it. Their current business trajectory is not profitable as is, and has become increasingly unprofitable as time passes. 

Even ignoring the interests, taxes, etc.. charges and focusing purely on EBIT... Their bear case is assuming GME will have more earnings in 2021 than they have had in the past. In fact, its worst assumed year is assuming they will have more than twice the earnings that GME had the last year they actually turned a profit, which was 4+ years ago.

If you exercise one call option, you will buy 100 shares for $10 = $1,000. The premium you paid was $83, so you'll have paid $1,083 or $10.83 a share for 100 shares. The shares will immediately be worth $1,253 (6pm extended hours final price) for a profit of $170.

If you sell to close you will get $246 (1 x 100 x $2.46), which you spent $83 on for a total profit of $163 - and also not spend $1,000 for a total value of $1,246.

    He's nervous, on the surface he looks retarded but ready 
    To drop more $$ but he keeps on forgettin' 
    What we called down, the audist DD goes so loud 
    He opens his account, but the gains won't come out 
    He's chokin', how, gaybears Jokin' now 
    The shorts run out, mar-ket’s over, blaow 
    Snap back to reality, ope 
    there goes GME Ope, 
    there goes Melvin, he choked 
    Rockets so mad, but they won't 
    give up that easy? No 
    They won't have it, Melv' knows 
    his whole back's to these ropes 
    It don't matter, he's dope, 
    he knows but, tards are broke 
    Stock's so stagnant, we know, 
    when he goes back to his mobile phone, that's when it's 
    Back to-red-dit again, yo, 
    this whole tragedy Better go capture this moment and hope it don't
    You better 
    lose yourself in the DeeDees, the crayons 
    You own it, you better never not yolo (yo)

    Make Cohen king, 
    as we move toward-a 
    GameStop Order 
    A boooom-er life is borin', 
    but stupid Mel-vin’s close to post mortem 
    It only grows redder, 
    only gets greener 
    It blows, it's all over, 
    these margin calls are all on him 
    Coast to coast shows, he's known as the short-wrecker 
    Lonely roads, got-em 
    He knows, he's flown farther from home, he's no doubter 
    He goes home and barely knows his co-workers 
    But hold your calls 'cause here goes the cold water 
    These bears don't want him no mo', there’s new product 
    They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and holds nada 
    And so the street opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the short goes on Da-da-dum, da-dum, da-da

    No more games, I'ma change what you call aged 
    Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two bulls caged 
    I was playin' in the beginnin', the gains all changed 
    I’ve seen stocks up and gains down and banned off page 
    But I kept buying and stepped right in the next cycle 
    Best believe some shorts's payin' the Pied Piper 
    All the pain inside amplified by the 
    Fact that I can't get by with in wall-street-bets 
    and 
    I can't provide the right type of 
    Life 
    for my family 'cause man, these goddamn Wendy stamps don't buy diapers 
    And its no movie, there's on-ly G-M-e 
    This is shorts life and these times are so hard 
    And it's getting even harder tryna buy and retain my gains, market Teeter totter, caught up between watchin a cramer and a prima donna Baby boomer drama, screamin' on tv, too much For me to wanna 
    stay in one bet, another day of rocket 
    moji's Gotten me to the point, I’ve got more shares to get,
    To formulate a plot or end up with $ROPE for naught 
    Success is my only motherfuckin' option, bankrupt is not 
    Mom, I love you, but this mel-vins got - to go, 
    I cannot grow old getting mcCucked 
    So here I go, squeeze my stock 
    Lord Cohen, fail me not,

    Losses inflating, through their A-hole that is gaping 
    Gay-bear funds is for the taking 
    Make Cohen king, 
    as we move toward-a 
    GameStop Order 
    A boooom-er life is borin',

    It only grows redder, 
    only gets greener 
    It blows, it's all over, 
    these margin calls are all on him 
    Coast to coast shows, he's known as the short-wrecker 
    Lonely roads, got-em 
    He knows, he's flown farther from home, he's no doubter 
    He goes home and barely knows his co-workers 
    But hold your calls 'cause here goes the cold water 
    These bears don't want him no mo', there’s new product 
    They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and holds nada 
    And so the street opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the short goes on Da-da-dum, da-dum, da-da

    No more games, I'ma change what you call aged 
    Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two bulls caged 
    I was playin' in the beginnin', the gains all changed 
    I’ve seen stocks up and gains down and banned off page 
    But I kept buying and stepped right in the next cycle 
    Best believe some shorts's payin' the Pied Piper 
    All the pain inside amplified by the 
    Fact that I can't get by with in wall-street-bets 
    and 
    I can't provide the right type of 
    Life 
    for my family 'cause man, these goddamn Wendy stamps don't buy diapers 
    And its no movie, there's on-ly G-M-e 
    This is shorts life and these times are so hard 
    And it's getting even harder tryna buy and retain my gains, market Teeter totter, caught up between watchin a cramer and a prima donna Baby boomer drama, screamin' on tv, too much For me to wanna 
    stay in one bet, another day of rocket 
    moji's Gotten me to the point, I’ve got more shares to get,
    To formulate a plot or end up with $ROPE for naught 
    Success is my only motherfuckin' option, bankrupt is not 
    Mom, I love you, but this mel-vins got - to go, 
    I cannot grow old getting mcCucked 
    So here I go, squeeze my stock 
    Lord Cohen, fail me not, 
    this may be the only opportunity that we got

That said, a creative person can find ways. The easiest is to use your CC to pay yourself via PayPal and then transfer that payment to your regular bank account(s).

it peaked on $38 and went back to $31 - he lost faith but of course he HOLD onto it

now look today, we have kinda strong support at $40 and peaked at $45 (new 52week high) - we will look back in a couple weeks and laugh about this abnormally low price and would buy for $50 INSTANTLY. (just like we would buy for 25 right now but back on last monday it would seem ridiculous)

this whole setup is like a giant pile of horse shit which just needs a little push in form of news from our god cohen or something remotely comparable

and remember: if EVERYTHING goes wrong we possibly hit rock bottom (i dont really believe in this) the best strategy is the same... JUST HOLD! in a couple years ryan will successfully transform GME and we still come out more profitable than any of those cheap ass hedge funds, boomers or r/investing
