0,GME,"There once was a stock that put to sea

The name of the stock was GME

The price blew up, the shorts dipped down

Hold my bully boys hold

​

Soon may the tendieman come

to send our rocket into the sun

One day when the trading is done

we'll take our gains and go

​

She had not been two weeks from shore

When Ryan Cohen joined the board

The captain called all hands and swore

He'll take his shares and hold

​

Soon may the tendieman come

to send our rocket into the sun

One day when the trading is done

we'll take our gains and go

​

Before the news had hit the market

Wall Street Bets came up and bought it

with diamond hands they knew they'd profit

if they could only hold

​

Soon may the tendieman come

to send our rocket into the sun

One day when the trading is done

we'll take our gains and go

​

No deals were cut, no shorts were squeezed

The captain's mind was not on greed

But he belonged to the autist's creed

He took the risk to hold

​

Soon may the tendieman come

to send our rocket into the sun

One day when the trading is done

we'll take our gains and go

​

For forty days or even more

the stock went up then down once more

All gains were lost, it was looking poor

but still those traders did hold

​

Soon may the tendieman come

to send our rocket into the sun

One day when the trading is done

we'll take our gains and go

​

As far as I've heard the fights still on

the shorts not squeezed and the gains not won

The tendieman makes his regular call

to encourage the captain, crew and all

​

Soon may the tendieman come

to send our rocket into the sun

One day when the trading is done

we'll take our gains and go

Soon may the tendieman come

The ships that took part in these races are known as clipper ships (or tea clippers), designed for speed over long distances. Times were surprisingly tight; in the 'Great Tea Race of 1866', after over 14,000 miles of sailing taking 99 days, the difference in time between first and second place was 28 minutes. Third place was only 1hr15 behind.

In this race, my family built 3 of the fastest 5 ships, including the winner (Taeping, pictured in the video above) and the runner up (Ariel).

Then some fuckers built the Suez Canal, which was better suited to steamships than sailing vessels and cut the route by a quarter, pretty much marking the end of my family's shipyard. Hence why I'm here chasing rockets instead of laughing at failed PLTR YOLOs from my family castle.

“Tomorrow at 11:30 Citron will livestream the 5 reasons GameStop $GME buyers at these levels are suckers at this poker game” 

- Making the livestream tomorrow buys them a day of uncertainty amongst boomers and 🧻 🙌 making it after 11:30 reduces the impact of $GME coming out the gate like a bull on speed market open

“Suckers at this poker game” 

- suggesting there’s a bluff in the shorts hands that we (people who have been tracking this for an entire year) don’t know about and they’re going to pull the wool over our eyes, again creating uncertainty 

“Stock back to $20 fast” 

- Creating fear amongst buyers and artificially setting the price. They just about managed to get a live stream going without getting electrocuted on their last tweet, the only analytic engines they’re running to get that price target is a fucking combustion engine (checks out since they’re 🌈 🐻‘s on $TSLA) 

“We understand short interest better than you and will explain”

“Tomorrow at 11:30 Citron will livestream the 5 reasons GameStop $GME buyers at these levels are suckers at this poker game” 

- Making the livestream tomorrow buys them a day of uncertainty amongst boomers and 🧻 🙌 making it after 11:30 reduces the impact of $GME coming out the gate like a bull on speed market open

“Suckers at this poker game” 

- suggesting there’s a bluff in the shorts hands that we (people who have been tracking this for an entire year) don’t know about and they’re going to pull the wool over our eyes, again creating uncertainty 

“Stock back to $20 fast” 

- Creating fear amongst buyers and artificially setting the price. They just about managed to get a live stream going without getting electrocuted on their last tweet, the only analytic engines they’re running to get that price target is a fucking combustion engine (checks out since they’re 🌈 🐻‘s on $TSLA) 

“We understand short interest better than you and will explain”

If instead, it reaches $500, set new sell limit to $475. Rinse an repeat. Let the some of your stocks ride through in case of a huge dip that triggers your limit but then continues to rise.

Listen Lads, 

I come here with a confession... 

I uhhhh, you see, the thing is, well... I NEVER CARED for this GME fetish you retards had going on here. 

Yep. Nada. Zippo. Zilch. 

I saw thread after thread, meme after meme, post after post, GME THIS, COHEN THAT, something about peanuts and NASA, “MoTheR of AlL ShOrT SquEeZe ReEEEEEee” ...all this insufferable bullshit ... and just kept thinking to myself, when the fuck will this end and this sub reddit can get back on track... 

Well... That was then. This is now. 

I don’t think some of you realize what a historic moment this has become, and what it represents. We are at an inflection point, a moment in history where future generations in 2040 will look back and say “Good men stood here, good men fought, and died on this ground” as they point to a TradingView daily chart of GME 2021 zoomed in on January...

Listen to me lads: 

Since the spawn of the stonk market, two classes of people have been pitted against each other, eternal enemies, forever forced and fated to combat—Lions and Hyenas. 

These Lions—these Wall Street hedge funds have it all. Quants, billions of dollars, algorithmic trading, arbitrage, market makers in their pockets, supercomputers, trading on inside information, SEC protection, fucking Judicial System Protection for Gods sake. Bail outs for reckless trades. Government protection. These dirty fucking criminal bastards have it all. 

And then, there’s us—the lowly Hyenas—retail—the working Man... The Average Joe. What do we have? WHAT THE FUCK DO WE HAVE? We’re ugly, we drool, we laugh stupid. 

THEY LITERALLY CALL US “DUMB” MONEY!

Dumb... money. They call us dumb, money. 

These lions, these hedge funds guys, they were born with silver spoons in their mouths, the top 1% of the 1%. They were given offices, overlooking beautiful NY city skyline... for nothing. They have massive bank accounts, eat medium rare Grade A Japanese Wagyu steak with truffle shavings for lunch. They wash that down with Macallan. They frequent the finest strip clubs on the planet on a first name basis and instantly go to the back rooms. They have blow and escorts on their yacht parties on the DAILY. The fucking... daily. 

And do you know what they tell these beautiful escorts? Do you know? When the smoking hot blonde escort with 5 million Instagram followers creeps in and asks them “Like, how do you have so much moneyyy?” 

You know what they say? 

They reply: “Haha, Dumb money babe. Dumb, money”





Dumb... money. 

Lads, this $GME trade is about class warfare. 

We may be hyenas yes, we may be retarded hyenas yes, we may be autistic hyenas YES, but guess what, you put enough of us together, and we can destroy a lion. 

Listen to me. These dirty fucking criminal hedge funds are scared. Just look at Cramer:

1) He’s called GME management to twist their arm into an offering, trying to protect these dirty cronies 

2) He’s congratulated Kurt Wolf on selling 90k shares IMPLYING HE SOLD IT FOR THE MONEY AND NOT BECAUSE HE HAD TO (the dishonesty is ridiculous and laughable)

3) He’s congratulated WSB on the “short squeeze” (implying that little thing, was it—hoping we’ll back off)

Listen to me: 

You know what kind of ppl Cramer is supporting here? You know what kind of crooks CNBC is promoting as good guys? These greedy little criminal fucking hedge funds tried to kill a good business and put tens of thousands out of work, all so they can make a quick buck. These are the people the media are protecting. This is what this war is about. 

This is about the rich trying to get richer at the cost of the working man, and using every tool in their arsenal for protection when they’re cornered. 

Cramer, CNBC, and the rest of the media are their dirty accomplices because guess what, THEY ARE THE MEDIA. They’re all one big conglomerate of steaming hot shit. 

...RETARDS, ASSEMBLE. 

I swear to God this has become personal after seeing how scared Cramer is. I didn’t believe any of this was true, but his reaction says it all. I’ve wanted nothing more than to stick it to them JUST ONCE. 

I’m throwing $10K into shares first thing at market open and holding till I’m fucking dead if it means just this once, this ONE fucking time, in all of history, that dumb money can take a W, and these dirty fucking crooks will learn dumb money, well they ain’t so dumb anymore...

And do you know what they tell these beautiful escorts? Do you know? When the smoking hot blonde escort with 5 million Instagram followers creeps in and asks them “Like, how do you have so much moneyyy?” 

You know what they say? 

They reply: “Haha, Dumb money babe. Dumb, money”





Dumb... money. 

Lads, this $GME trade is about class warfare. 

We may be hyenas yes, we may be retarded hyenas yes, we may be autistic hyenas YES, but guess what, you put enough of us together, and we can destroy a lion. 

Listen to me. These dirty fucking criminal hedge funds are scared. Just look at Cramer:

1) He’s called GME management to twist their arm into an offering, trying to protect these dirty cronies 

2) He’s congratulated Kurt Wolf on selling 90k shares IMPLYING HE SOLD IT FOR THE MONEY AND NOT BECAUSE HE HAD TO (the dishonesty is ridiculous and laughable)

3) He’s congratulated WSB on the “short squeeze” (implying that little thing, was it—hoping we’ll back off)

Listen to me: 

You know what kind of ppl Cramer is supporting here? You know what kind of crooks CNBC is promoting as good guys? These greedy little criminal fucking hedge funds tried to kill a good business and put tens of thousands out of work, all so they can make a quick buck. These are the people the media are protecting. This is what this war is about. 

This is about the rich trying to get richer at the cost of the working man, and using every tool in their arsenal for protection when they’re cornered. 

Cramer, CNBC, and the rest of the media are their dirty accomplices because guess what, THEY ARE THE MEDIA. They’re all one big conglomerate of steaming hot shit. 

...RETARDS, ASSEMBLE. 

I swear to God this has become personal after seeing how scared Cramer is. I didn’t believe any of this was true, but his reaction says it all. I’ve wanted nothing more than to stick it to them JUST ONCE. 

I’m throwing $10K into shares first thing at market open and holding till I’m fucking dead if it means just this once, this ONE fucking time, in all of history, that dumb money can take a W, and these dirty fucking crooks will learn dumb money, well they ain’t so dumb anymore...

I saw thread after thread, meme after meme, post after post, GME THIS, COHEN THAT, something about peanuts and NASA, “MoTheR of AlL ShOrT SquEeZe ReEEEEEee” ...all this insufferable bullshit ... and just kept thinking to myself, when the fuck will this end and this sub reddit can get back on track... 

Well... That was then. This is now. 

I don’t think some of you realize what a historic moment this has become, and what it represents. We are at an inflection point, a moment in history where future generations in 2040 will look back and say “Good men stood here, good men fought, and died on this ground” as they point to a TradingView daily chart of GME 2021 zoomed in on January...

Listen to me lads: 

Since the spawn of the stonk market, two classes of people have been pitted against each other, eternal enemies, forever forced and fated to combat—Lions and Hyenas. 

These Lions—these Wall Street hedge funds have it all. Quants, billions of dollars, algorithmic trading, arbitrage, market makers in their pockets, supercomputers, trading on inside information, SEC protection, fucking Judicial System Protection for Gods sake. Bail outs for reckless trades. Government protection. These dirty fucking criminal bastards have it all. 

And then, there’s us—the lowly Hyenas—retail—the working Man... The Average Joe. What do we have? WHAT THE FUCK DO WE HAVE? We’re ugly, we drool, we laugh stupid. 

THEY LITERALLY CALL US “DUMB” MONEY!

Dumb... money. They call us dumb, money. 

These lions, these hedge funds guys, they were born with silver spoons in their mouths, the top 1% of the 1%. They were given offices, overlooking beautiful NY city skyline... for nothing. They have massive bank accounts, eat medium rare Grade A Japanese Wagyu steak with truffle shavings for lunch. They wash that down with Macallan. They frequent the finest strip clubs on the planet on a first name basis and instantly go to the back rooms. They have blow and escorts on their yacht parties on the DAILY. The fucking... daily. 

And do you know what they tell these beautiful escorts? Do you know? When the smoking hot blonde escort with 5 million Instagram followers creeps in and asks them “Like, how do you have so much moneyyy?” 

You know what they say? 

They reply: “Haha, Dumb money babe. Dumb, money”





Dumb... money. 

Lads, this $GME trade is about class warfare. 

We may be hyenas yes, we may be retarded hyenas yes, we may be autistic hyenas YES, but guess what, you put enough of us together, and we can destroy a lion. 

Listen to me. These dirty fucking criminal hedge funds are scared. Just look at Cramer:

1) He’s called GME management to twist their arm into an offering, trying to protect these dirty cronies 

2) He’s congratulated Kurt Wolf on selling 90k shares IMPLYING HE SOLD IT FOR THE MONEY AND NOT BECAUSE HE HAD TO (the dishonesty is ridiculous and laughable)

3) He’s congratulated WSB on the “short squeeze” (implying that little thing, was it—hoping we’ll back off)

Listen to me: 

You know what kind of ppl Cramer is supporting here? You know what kind of crooks CNBC is promoting as good guys? These greedy little criminal fucking hedge funds tried to kill a good business and put tens of thousands out of work, all so they can make a quick buck. These are the people the media are protecting. This is what this war is about. 

This is about the rich trying to get richer at the cost of the working man, and using every tool in their arsenal for protection when they’re cornered. 

Cramer, CNBC, and the rest of the media are their dirty accomplices because guess what, THEY ARE THE MEDIA. They’re all one big conglomerate of steaming hot shit. 

...RETARDS, ASSEMBLE. 

I swear to God this has become personal after seeing how scared Cramer is. I didn’t believe any of this was true, but his reaction says it all. I’ve wanted nothing more than to stick it to them JUST ONCE. 

I’m throwing $10K into shares first thing at market open and holding till I’m fucking dead if it means just this once, this ONE fucking time, in all of history, that dumb money can take a W, and these dirty fucking crooks will learn dumb money, well they ain’t so dumb anymore...

* ""Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him. ""
   * GME  bulls are fighting on their own terms, the short squeeze has started,  they are scrambling to repel the onslaught and having to cover their  short positions. They are desperate and are doing anything they can to  get GME bulls to pull back.
* ""By  holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of   his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for   the enemy to draw near. ""
   * The  pressure was place on the shorts, they are feeling the burn of the  short squeeze and forced them to double down on their short positions,  putting GME at 138% of short volume. They have placed themselves at a  very dangerous point where they either stop the price rise or GME share  price continues to rise and they are forced to cover their short  positions causing the price to spike further and forcing more shorts to  cover. They have placed themselves at the edge of that cliff. There is  only two options for them, force the price down through FUD and scare  tactics or jump off the cliff and cover their short positions allowing  the short squeeze to spike further.
* ""You  may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the   enemy's weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your   movements are more rapid than those of the enemy. ""
   * Their  weak point is their doubled down short positions post the rise to 35-40  last week. GME bulls will be safe from further pursuit if they rapidly  make the stock price jump up. Shorts will be forced to cover,  institutions and laws will force them to. They cannot continue to short  with rising prices. They are close to their breaking point, but swift  upward pressure must be mounted. How much pressure we need, I don't know. But my understanding is it's on the table.

281,TSLA,"This  message must be heard everywhere and go to other retail investors and  the sources of where GME shorts are trying to get eyeballs to dissuade  people from being involved in the short squeeze. The GME bull message  must go to twitter, instagram, whatsapp, facebook, everywhere. The GME  bull evangel must be heard. Citrons  twitter feed needs to be spammed  and his FUD and propaganda dissected. This is the sign that shorts are  terrified, they didn't see this coming, they assumed that retail  investors were to stupid to notice a short squeeze. Nobody backs down  when their enemy shows weakness. They offer no quarter, when opportunity  is available. Regular retail investors don't respond to blind faith,  they need to see the reason this is happening and why they should not  listen to shorts like Citron and Melvin trying to cover their asses as  they try to cut the legs off of retail investors.

The people need to see this:

Citron's other recent failed short positions.

* shorting PTON at 20 with price target of 5 (now at 150)
* shorting NIO at 45 with price target of 25 (now at 58)
* shorting TSLA at 180 (now at 840)
* shorting NVDA at 150 with price target of 130 (now at 520)
* shorting W at 85 with price target of 45 (now at 295)
* bullish on BB at 11 with price target of 20, three and a half years ago (now at 11)

Don't forget Citron's $7 price target for PLUG! lmao it's at 65 now

here's some more:

* shorting BLNK with PT of 10 (now at 46)
* shorting SOLO with PT of 2 (now at 7.5)
* currently shorting LMND with PT of 100 (now at 140)

It   should also be mentioned that NONE OF THESE short positions hit their  dumbass price  targets after they tweeted them, and frankly they didn't  even get  reasonably close.

SUN TZU, The Art of War"" :

* ""Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him. ""
   * GME  bulls are fighting on their own terms, the short squeeze has started,  they are scrambling to repel the onslaught and having to cover their  short positions. They are desperate and are doing anything they can to  get GME bulls to pull back.
* ""By  holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of   his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for   the enemy to draw near. ""
   * The  pressure was place on the shorts, they are feeling the burn of the  short squeeze and forced them to double down on their short positions,  putting GME at 138% of short volume. They have placed themselves at a  very dangerous point where they either stop the price rise or GME share  price continues to rise and they are forced to cover their short  positions causing the price to spike further and forcing more shorts to  cover. They have placed themselves at the edge of that cliff. There is  only two options for them, force the price down through FUD and scare  tactics or jump off the cliff and cover their short positions allowing  the short squeeze to spike further.
* ""You  may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the   enemy's weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your   movements are more rapid than those of the enemy. ""
   * Their  weak point is their doubled down short positions post the rise to 35-40  last week. GME bulls will be safe from further pursuit if they rapidly  make the stock price jump up. Shorts will be forced to cover,  institutions and laws will force them to. They cannot continue to short  with rising prices. They are close to their breaking point, but swift  upward pressure must be mounted. How much pressure we need, I don't know. But my understanding is it's on the table.

>“APPLE TEAMING UP WITH SAMSUNG., ROKU CEO selling last week, and short interest at lows \[sic\]. Risk/reward no longer there. Expect big retracement. **ROKU stock is uninvestable now.**""

The stock actually fell for a few days after the report, but has since steadily grown and, no, a supposed Apple + Samsung alliance wouldn't have mattered. Roku's strategy, similar to what Sirius did with cars, has set them up to be a long-term giant.

Everyone knew this, but Citron had just closed their position after Roku's bump, and apparently thought they could convince people to do the same (to help their new short position) with this hilarious, pathetic tweet.

Well, it's been almost exactly 2 years and Roku is worth more than 10 TIMES what it was when Citron told everyone to sell. Imagine, a $3,000 investment 2 years ago would be worth nearly $45,000 today--and there's no real end in sight. And the sad thing is that a lot of people did sell, and probably never got back in.

The idea of gamestop having all of this stuff and probably a pc specialist to help with builds is a huge green light. Imagine all the people that go home and build their pc alone with a youtube vid up would be replaced by just going in and building it with someone at gamestop (not sure if that's the plan but maybe?). 

As far as the online goes, again their e-commerce went up 800% and now they have a possible ceo who grew a HUGE online brand and obviously knows that market well. Gamestop already has the branding they just need to convince people to switch to using them for their gaming needs which personally I'm going to put my money where my mouth is and start getting what I need from gamestop when I can. 

Lots of it also comes down to just believing in RC. Which I have decided after his recent tweets I do. He wants this shit to work, and he turned millions into billions once already. Imagine what he can do with an already established gamestop. I honestly believe all it needs is the new ideas and outlook he and his buddies will bring to completely turn the company around. 

I'd love to see a fucking squeeze I'm the next week or so because my investment is pretty small. If there is a squeeze, my plan is reinvest all my profits back into gamestop after the price goes way down again or stabilizes to hold long term and then put my initial investment into bb immediately.

573,WING,"Yes, I think 2 years from now their stock is 70$-80$ easy if not higher honestly. I have no idea what they have thought up for the future but we do have a glimpse of it and to me it seems like a great business model. People don't want to stop going to retail stores, it's just right now they have to, retail stores aside though their e-commerce sales this year went up some 800%. That's no joke and it appears they are currently redoing their online presence as well. My guess is they are going to make it feel VERY nice to use their website and I would imagine there will be perks involved also. 

https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/

This is almost all I need to be on board long term. This is huge. 

Also they are about to open PC stores is building stations. That is huge also. PC gaming is BLOWING up rn. I would be they have something in the works to be able to deliver very nice PCs for a very nice price. The competition for retail PC gaming would be low. Around me there's microcenter but they only have so many stores, i think less than 10. So the next one is best buy, but they barely carry gaming pc parts.

575,IMO,"I said for a long time gamestop needed to close stores and make the stores different - Incorporate more PC and table top gaming - and that's exactly what they're doing. Adding in a ""Build your own Pc"" kiosk which is gonna do huge IMO, then adding room for both table top gaming like Warhammer (those lil collectable figures sell for a fuck of a lot more than you might think) and having in store games + possibly having in store advanced VR experiences people can pay to play + LAN and all that. 

Then they're talking about expanding into the digital market much more aggressively with online trade-ins and all of that is before you account for the crazy deal they have with Microsoft. 

I think they'll be around for awhile, especially if they fully morph into an ""All things geek"" type of store - possibly even adding things like comic books and gaming tournaments. With E-Sports blowing up, I wouldn't count them out just yet. 

After all, all Chewy was is a fuckin' dog food store and somehow it clowned everyone stupid hard.",0.087,0.832,0.081,-0.2944

577,GME,"This is an infinitely more informative comment than mine but I’d just like to add that Dr. Michael Burry (the ultimate Gigachad) is going long on GME (he probably made a fuck ton of money given that he bought 3 million shares in August of 2019).

One of the reasons why he purchased GME was because the newest iteration of consoles from Sony and Microsoft still have disc drives.

GameStop essentially has a monopoly on trading in used games. They generate revenue by selling the used games at a markup. Yeah, you could sell your old games on eBay or whatever but who the fuck has time for that.

578,MC,"Just to add to the comment

As a pc gamer/consumer I can say that microcenter is the only place to offer full stores centered on PC gaming where you can find all the best parts and build right there. Microcenter almost always has the best prices on parts. The only catch to that is they're all 'in store only' prices. For me this isn't an issue as I have a microcenter within reasonable driving distance, but MC has very few stores and most people can't access them. This, to me, means all  gamestop has to do is have more stores and similar operation programs to MC and they could dominate the gaming hardware market.

So for example in October 2017 they said Shopify was a completely illegal get-rich-quick scheme and would fall from it's price of $103.30 to $60 (and then further once the Federal Trade Commission investigated). They were very wrong; Shopify is over $1,000 today.

Basically what they do is short a stock, then make up a story about how the stock will go down in price, then when idiots listen to them and sell the stock they close their short positions for a profit. Or if they want to be long on a stock they make up a negative story, wait for idiots to sell, then buy the dip (that they created).",0.089,0.884,0.027,-0.8908

So I don't think it can boiled down to this single Armageddon date per se. _if_ are large quantity of the shorts ""expire"" 1/22 then yes, the spike could happen this week. However, nobody should sell at the spike. If we mass sell, then it'll just come right back to where it's at now. But if we all hold, then it should maintain to where it's inflated. Maybe if we're extra patient, institutions will start trying to short en masse again and we can get a second mini spike.

Basically, there's still a lot of variance that could happen right now. But the rules are:

a) it's not yet too late to buy.
b) we should be holding indefinitely. Stock is estimated to be 100-300$ (despite this sub being retarded, there's actually some really good DD on why that is)",0.053,0.91,0.037,-0.3832

996,GME,"No, you are right. Melvin and many many others borrowed shares from institutions/anyone who owned $GME and sold them instantly. They paid a premium to do this (just like options). The plan is obviously to return those shares at a later agreed upon date hoping the price is cheap and profit margin exists.

What is happening now is Melvin's expiration was 1/15 but they rolled it to 1/22 I believe (this could be misinformation sorry) and they HAVE to buy and return all the shares they shorted, but since the short percentage for GME has been as high as 140+% (supposed to be illegal since it means many sold GME without owning or borrowing - called naked shorting - confusing you have to google this bc i don't fully get it) there are literally not enough shares of GME for all these short sellers to close (which is why us holding shares makes the problem worse for them). Therefore the insane bidding war for these remaining shares will cause a giant green explosion on GME (hopefully) as all these shorts fight to close before this happens.

Fully marginable shares at Schwab have a 30% maintenance requirement. Think basic stuff like Apple, Walmart, Visa. Stocks you won't see swing too wildly in price. Other stocks with more volatility, such as Tesla, have a 65% maintenance requirement.

Maintenance requirement means the amount of your investment you need to *personally own.* I can sit on $100,000 in Apple stock (and realize the gains of 100k of apple) that I only had $30,000 to pay for. Schwab would front me the other $70,000, if I had appropriate collateral in my account. Keep in mind if it drops by a penny, I'm now in a maintenance call.

Anyway, because of GME's recently crazy volatility, they bumped the maintenance requirement to 200%. If I have $10k in GME, not only do I need to own those shares outright, it's going to eat into another $10k off of the rest of my marginable securities, forcing me to have more equity in my account.

1246,GME,"Sorry for the confusion. I'm not talking about shares owned on margin. I mean that the number of long shares owned at the moment is many millions more than the number of shares originally issued by GME. 

Obviously the math checks out, since short sellers are holding a corresponding number of negative shares, but since there's currently no limit to the number of times a share can be borrowed and sold, there are now more synthetic shares out there than there ever were actual shares.

They keep shorting. We keep buying and holding, along with insiders and some big institutions. We are beyond locking up the actual float, and the float is going deeper and deeper into the negative. They can borrow and sell easily, but buying those shares back will be infinitely more challenging.

Here's a TSDU (too short, didn't understand)
If autist1 has 100 shares, shortGuy42 borrows those shares and sells to autist2. Both autists now own 100 shares, and shortGuy42 is at -100. 

shortGuy42 borrows from autist2 now, and sells to autist3, and then from autist3 and sells to autist4.

All four autists now have legitimate long positions of 100 shares. There's no distinction about which shares came from what short sale, or any shares being more or less *real* than others. Even though there was only 100 shares to start with, we now see 400 shares owned. shortGuy42 is now at -300 and is racking up 3x losses for every gain the autists get. In order to close out his position, he has to convince not just one autist to sell, but three of them. If just 2/4 hold steady, it will actually be impossible for him to escape the trade, and those 2 who held will be able to get whatever price they want, since it's that or face infinite losses.

Now blow this up to the actual scale of the market. If every share was only allowed to be shorted once, (as it is in some countries) then there would be at most double the number of shares owned than actually exist, offset by the negative shares. But here, the shorts have borrowed and sold more than the number of shares actually in existence, and with each passing day, more and more shares are being bought up by people/entities who won't/can't sell, resulting in actual negative float. Meaning with all of the shares trading hands in a day, it's not even enough to get back to that level where synthetic shares = real shares.

There are some big players involved who either won't sell or can't sell their shares due to restrictions, so the best the shorts can do is keep trying to manipulate the price back down, by shorting even more, hiring spokespeople to report/write/tweet negative-biased info, and keep paying money out in highly inflated short fees. The moment that anyone tries to actually close sizable short positions, beyond the amount of shares being sold by opening up *new* short positions, they will find that there is very little actual liquidity, and the price will shoot up. 🚀",0.152,0.786,0.061,-0.9931
1247,GME,"I see what you meant. I was trying to clarify for any new investors that, if you buy a share, you don’t have to worry about if it’s a “real” share. But you’re correct about the mechanics and implications. I don’t actually have a horse in this race, other than buying a few calls just for fun, but it will be really interesting to see how it plays out. 

Reminds me of a quote front 1929. During the crash, there were several coordinated attempts by wealthy individuals/institutions to stabilize the market by buying shares that were being dumped. The quote I remember, from when they gave up, is “there is no man or group of men capable of buying all the shares the public is trying to sell.” This seems like the same thing, but reversed. 

I can’t quite figure how WSB picked GME as the “hill to die on” though. Not knocking the company, just not really sure where the sudden attachment came from. Nostalgia?",0.106,0.735,0.159,0.8004

1249,EARS,"I think the shorts picked it, honestly. Everyone sort of assumed as an aging brick and mortar retailer in an increasingly digital world, that they would eventually just quietly disappear. That confidence led to YEARS of artificially deflated share prices, because everyone was climbing over each other to sell sell sell, thinking anything above $0.00 would be guaranteed profit.

Then people start looking at earnings, console cycles, revenue growth in the digital space, optimization of retail locations, and it's like ""oh, maybe they're not dying as fast as we thought."" If the stock had been fairly valued, all of that would have been priced in.

Then Chewy Crew shows up, and adds a little bit of excitement back into the mix. It's no longer about just not dying, it's about transforming into a new modern version of itself that provides great value to the customers within the new gaming paradigm.

Your quote is very fitting! Literally nobody exists capable of selling enough shares for all the shorts to cover. So just take that graph from 1929 and flip it upside down, and that's our plotted trajectory. 🚀",0.02,0.805,0.175,0.9841

However since gme is already publicly listed we do not have this constraint, we can each pick our own exit strategy according to personal risk tolerance / growth projections.

Why would Cohen dilute shareholders? Not his style. Read about Cohen's history with Chewy. They prided themselves on FCF from operations.

Even without Cohen, GME has been paying down debt using FCF from operations BEFORE the new console sales. They're doing fine now, and already have more cash than debt.

The only reason I see a share offering happening is if Cohen's got a capital-intensive strategy and they can't find any other way to fund it. In that case though, strategy comes first, not the share offering.

So the share is loaned when they get called on that short by the purchaser, but then they sold uncovered so they have to come up with the shares, right?

They’re shady as fuck and have been wrong on almost all of their “professional opinions” on stocks—they are just short selling market manipulators looking to deceive the public with another one of their scams. 

WSB has a lot of people who have bought stock, but there aren’t abject falsehoods being posted about GME. There aren’t blatant deceptive tactics from promoters like with penny stock pump n dumps. There’s nothing illegal about fucking over the short sellers by seeking a profit. I am invested in GME because I want to make money.

A stock isn't a good short candidate if a) it's already shorted to hell, b) it's already trading at a sizeable discount to future cash flows, and big bad c) just because it's increased in price.

Shorts who came in at $20 made a huge and classic mistake thinking a stock that has appreciated 500% in 6 or 8 months *has* to go back down.

I think Citron established a short that is already significantly underwater, and they're desperate to push this back down to cover at a smaller loss.

The Tweet wording is extremely telling.  They're trying to scare everyone that GME is an enormous gamble and will fall right back to $20 in days.  Not likely to happen, and Citron is desperate to get out before Wall St. starts seeing a real plan from GME that has analysts seeing dollar signs.

Longs please don't do stupid things. Learn from the experienced members. If short term winning/losing money is important to you, don't go all in with full margin. Have a plan, take advantage of the manipulators. Buy low.

I went to best buy and Walmart for PS5s and they didn’t even have displays set up and said they’ll get no irl stock, yet their online sales weren’t spectacular at all. All GME stores had waitlists of 100 people since they literally said no more waitlists. 

They’re still the #1 store to go to for exclusive edition console launches such as the animal crossing switch. Brand value is still up there, and there are still a ton of people who buy physical. I own a switch and all my games are physical. 

I’m literally autistic like everyone else but I do believe that GME could shake up the digital market since no new innovation has really happened besides the XBOX game pass in the digital space since steam. Microsoft (who is now pushing digital insanely hard) investing and partnering with GME shows signs of a future that is way brighter than What the boomers are saying (blockbuster toys r us) 

If toys r us can be bought out and stay alive in Canada without any major shakeups, then I think GameStop under Cohen with Microsoft deal can get back to previous stock prices. 

Microsoft is RICH, but would they really give GME a cut of all digital console store sales if they didn’t think they had the potential to MOVE CONSOLES? so the foot traffic and sales are definitely substantial, even in the coming years to warrant a move like that. 

I don’t think GME will be absolutely gigantic, but if a freaking goddamn online pet shop can have 45b valuation (and only available in the US) then I think GME can freaking break $50...

Again, nobody really is lining up at Walmart to buy the latest call of duty

Edit: my positions are 160 shares GME at avg price of 26.2, even if the shorts and paper hands fuck everyone over since the SEC rule has now ended, I still think the price will go higher than now in a year or two with the new changes they’re looking to bring.

With a protective put. Youre selling a put option with only collateral in your accoun, not shares. Selling calls may seem better for BB in terms of premium payout to the seller, but not when its on a giant bull run, you'll lose your shares. Selling puts is obviously more profitable after a stock tanks, but if youre okay with owning shares of BB, and collecting near $100 per option you sell. Its a nice way to make a fee bucks, if the option gets called away, who cares. BB TO THE MOON🚀🚀🚀🚀",0.028,0.774,0.198,0.9614

-185 million cars currently use BB software 

-Deal with AWS is gonna be huge. A lot of that pump got erased for no real reason.

-BB has over 10,000 patents and is suing companies like fb and snap who infringed on some of those. They also sold some of their old phone patents.

Treasury secretary nominee Janet Yellen on Tuesday pledged to create a team to focus on climate change, in a move that's likely to put the powerful agency at the forefront of the Biden administration's efforts to combat what she called an ""existential threat.""

In a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, Yellen said she planned to start a new Treasury ""hub"" that would examine financial system risks arising from climate change and on related tax policy incentives. She also intends to appoint a ""very senior-level"" official to lead climate efforts.

Considering that GameStop frequently has items across the Funko brand that are exclusive to GameStop, they are essentially guaranteed to sell their entire stock in seconds if the Pop, or what have you, is in the right family. The online release of Star Wars Revan was sold out in seconds as robots bought them out to be upsold on the aftermarket. Now the little fucker can't be had for less than $40. With the upcoming release of so many SW projects, you can bet Disney is going to be trying to make up their losses from the army of Rose Ticos still haunting some shelves.

Pop collectors are completionists and even worse at managing money than your average cheese-brained RH user. They gobble up the exact same figures they already have because the new ones have a chrome finish. They all bitch and moan but buy them anyway! Funko has a monopoly on something like a $700M annual industry and GameStop has a regular slice of that pie all to itself with exclusives. Plus if you want a little more grease on that green dildo, Funko reported a 150% increase in e-commerce sales in Q320. Now that was direct to consumer, but no one actually buys from Funko because, again, robots. Funko does their best with queues and purchase limits but it is almost always a dog's dinner. So the average collector will make online purchases at a variety of retailers including our pals at GameStop who have a pretty regular deal of Buy 3 get 1 free. Point being though that Funko purchases, like everything else, are happening more and more online. I'd love to know what portion of GameStop's e-commerce increase was Pops.

The Funko market is only going to get bigger as more collectors enter the market. And Funko will never run out of ideas. Not as long as they keep making tv shows, movies, and other media. Hell they just released Back to the Future and Die Hard Pops! Funko doesn't sell collectible figures. They sell the emotion you associate with Luke Skywalker, Peter Venkman, or Goku packaged in vinyl and shaped into the exaggerated cranial features that human beings are biologically predisposed to liking.

If we hit another videocard shortage, of which we are in the midst of, its game over for those stations for months. 

They need to shed these stores and go digital, the stores are an anchor around their neck. People talking about Pokémon and MtG cards clearly have no idea about the secondary market on these things. Take your average GME and now implement the ideas pitched:

Space for VR trials, there is a chunk of wasted space for an industry that never took off and is passed its hype phase.

Space for gaming tournaments, chairs, tables, monitors, consoles, etc.

Space for PC building centers.

Space for card players, MtG, Pokémon, etc.

Then try to fit it in most GME stores ... it's not realistic. Also you need to license every game played in the tournaments, you can't just pop in copies and play when you are a major entity like GME.

2489,DD,"Yeah I agree long term. The gaming industry is moving towards a fully digital delivery for games and there's no denying it. Granted it's taking longer than many predicted in the past, but there's no doubt physical disks will be a thing of the past.

It's a world I can't honestly see GME surviving in. I see people comparing Chewy to GameStop, but the flaw in that analogy is that Chewy offer a product that can only be physically delivered. You can't download pet food and supplies digitally. So it's much more realistic for Chewy to take on Amazon and win, which they did.

But the theory that GameStop will move to e-commerce is flawed from the start - the games industry is moving away from physical e-commerce. GameStop can't create an online digital delivery platform for console, it's a non-starter since Sony and Microsoft have their own stores.

If they did one for PC gamers I can't see it taking off either. It's already a massively overcrowded marketplace with almost every game developer from Rockstar to Epic having their own store (not to mention Steam). And in addition to this it costs a fortune to build the tech to actually deliver the games in the way gamers expect. GOG is a popular platform these days but CDPR only started making a very small profit from it in the last few years, it basically burned through money building the infrastructure to deliver the games digitally.

So nice short/medium term gains due to the squeeze? Hell yeah, count me in. For long term survival of GameStop? I don't buy it. I think a lot of investors/traders don't know anything about the games industry, and don't know how gamers think.

*Although the vast majority of short sales are legal, abusive short sale practices are illegal. For example, it is prohibited for any person to engage in a series of transactions in order to create actual or apparent active trading in a security or to depress the price of a security for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of the security by others. Thus, short sales effected to manipulate the price of a stock are prohibited.*

3228,GME,"I agree with the last part, except for one thing. 

It actually is illegal ( unless I’m misunderstanding, in which case happy to be corrected) to rally investors with the EXPLICIT GOAL of a short squeeze. I’m pretty sure that counts as market manipulation.

I don’t think anything on here is actually prosecutable as most of us actually believe in GME as a company, myself included ( you can see in my post history multiple posts making the argument of GME as value company totally separate from the squeeze).

It is absolutely not illegal to go long and when you start talking about what is illegal past that we hit some pretty fine legal lines. It doesn’t strike me as sensible to say it’s illegal to just mention the possibility, but there have been posts on here explicitly calling for people to squeeze that I feel like are a different discussion.

Please do allow me to be clear though - the real illegal and horrendous bullshit is the naked short selling when it’s explicitly prohibited but they treat the lending fees like parking tickets. Even worse is the obvious market manipulators like Citron buying puts and releasing hit pieces.

If you exercise one call option, you will buy 100 shares for $10 = $1,000. The premium you paid was $83, so you'll have paid $1,083 or $10.83 a share for 100 shares. The shares will immediately be worth $1,253 (6pm extended hours final price) for a profit of $170.

If you sell to close you will get $246 (1 x 100 x $2.46), which you spent $83 on for a total profit of $163 - and also not spend $1,000 for a total value of $1,246.

But I’m skeptical about GMEs e-commerce revenues. This year especially with COVID and e-commerce killing it.

I’m a retard that works part time at a resale shop that buys and sells video games. One phenomenon that’s happened is almost every video game and console ever made jumped in demand and price. We are abnormally sold out on a lot of video game merch..

For example, a year ago GME was selling Xbox 360s for $50 with a 100% mail in rebate. Basically giving them away for free. We even had a hard time selling them. But now we can barely keep em in stock @ $70 

Also We used to sell Original Wii’s @ $50 a pop. Now we can’t keep in the store for $80. 

Look at pricecharting .com and search any game/console. The graphs shows prices over the last 5/10 years.

Basically People are going nuts for games right now. But when Covids over, And government checks stop flying, I have a hard time believing these prices and volume of sales will continue. 

I do think GMEs future is in solid leadership and an Amazon Prime subscription type approach. But I really don’t know to what extent. If E-commerce is the way, they’ll have to expand what they sell. GME makes no money with new games/consols. all their revenue comes from pre-owned games/consoles. 

I know they have a subscription platform & offer higher payouts with it. But If they can heavily discount the preowned stock with, they will be on to something. But I don’t know if that will 100% do the trick.

RC is also known as customer service focused and he's actually a good dude. I believe he sees the value in Gamestop's positioning and recognition and wants to turn it around. They hype they've received alone and a few positive articles later, gamers will forget about the old Gamestop. I truly think 3-5 years from now we're looking at 600-700$ Share price. I've studied up on RC and he is not a half assed kinda person. He went all in because he believes he can make Gamestop the next Amazon.",0.031,0.8,0.168,0.9721

I have a ton of knowledge on things like this and retail.

Glancing over your article I've noticed several assumptions you are making that misunderstand things. Additionally you are taking several data points and extrapolating them inappropriately. You're building ""castles to the sky"" without really understanding the fundementals of the situation.

I would suggest that you try hard to learn as much as you can in the space before betting on something like this at this stage of the investment. If you were putting money into Overstock.com at $3 a share last year after it got crushed, I could see it. Or maybe Tesla when it was relatively reasonably priced vs the risk because of their debt issues before the pandemic. (If you went far back enough, you could have bought Netflix at an 80% discount after the Quickster debacle; which you could have pitched as a quasi VC-type of investment because at that time a VC actually decided to do a debt offering and buy shares of Netflix as a public company as well.)

But you are chasing a stock like GameStop because you have some belief that this Ryan guy (who, let's be clear, got kind of lucky because of the pandemic...kind of like how lucky Mark Cuban did when he sold before the internet bubble crashed) can repeat his success in an entirely different business; regardless of how he's pitching it. 

A lot of the gains on GME so far have been driven by retards on this sub following the pied piper thinking that there is some magic fairy dust that promises them $100 per share or more in the future. The odds of GME falling back under $20 are far higher than the odds of it increasing to $100 per share. Especially under a Biden / Yellen administration.

My advice to you is to spend a lot more time learning and reading up on VC. It is very different than stock investing; as I'm sure you are aware. I commend you on your attempt above to really push on yourself to write an analysis and think through everything. Doing so will help you in the future improve your analysis. And over time you might get access to deals and grow your money that way. Rather than gambling on GME shares (Personally I think you'll make more money speculating on Basketball cards this year than GME. Maybe buying rookies of Jerami Grant or Jokic or whatever hot player there is and flipping them. It's the same gamble as doing this play on GME. Especially since it has moved so far and so fast.)

The best investment I think you can make is to buy and read this book. It is pretty honest and gets to the way people really make big money with these things.
