8,AI," I personally believe that however you look at it, investing and stock prices and all that is pure speculation.

The market works on sentiment and never on logical thinking.

I always say there are 2 different types of people, investors and these are the ones that buy and hold for long, and traders and those are the ultimate speculators who are constantly trying to time the market and selling when things go up and buying when things go down, and irrespective on what they say, it stays a big gambling discipline. 

However I am working closely with a major trading and investment firm and what they are trying todo  is make use of quantum computers and advanced algorithms, AI and ML to have a better more informative view about the market behavior and possible directions so they can make as much informative trading decisions as possible.

When dealing with GOOD stocks and investments, you don't lose until you sell.

(Yes, I use to have Blackberry and still have a little PLTR to remind me not be stupid.)

In summary, yes, you ""technically"" only lose when you sell, but if you are holding a stock 30-40% down that keeps performing poorly, it might be a subpar investment compared to Index funds even.  Worse, some companies don't recover, some can be down 80% ten years later, others go bankrupt.

In fact I own a lot of the ones you picked for years now and have grown a $1.5M taxable account of exactly these kinds of dividend paying and large growth stocks... in *addition* to significant index fund balances.

What's often overlooked is that petroleum refinery accounts for a considerable revenue share right now thanks to government regulations encouraging desulphurisation of fuels. Essentially, you don't even have to bet on the future hydrogen market, when the market is already there, no matter whether we see a move to ev soon or not. Rising demand for petroleum coke in the steel industry and development in the cement and power generation industries also drive the hydrogen generation market.

173,IMO," Ligand (LGND). They have a massive pipeline of drugs in various stages of approval with dozens and dozens of pharmaceutical companies worldwide, including the big pharma names. Ligand provides the medium by which the drugs are delivered to the body.

They earn milestone payments as drugs progress through the clinical stages, and royalties if they go into production. They also make and sell Captisol (Google it) with good margins. It is a complex business with a lot of moving parts. To date only a small number of potential drugs are currently earning royalties.

They are profitable, have good management, positive cash flow and proof of delivering profits. They have a lot of cash after selling one of their drugs last year and plenty of patents. They have attracted the attention of a couple of hedge funds, the head of one was prosecuted by the SEC for putting out false information (Greg Lemelson) a couple of years ago. This has resulted in some wild swings in the share price (manipulation perhaps?). Ligand have previously had share buyback programmes and do not correctly pay a dividend.

In this case (let's ignore any deductions for simplicity and single filer) ur total income is 180k + 39k

Ur taxable income is the same (since we keeping this simple and ignoring deductions) 

Ur ordinary income is 39k. Ur long term gains is 180k.


Ur taxes are now as followed

* 10% on first 9950 = 995
* 12% on 9951 - 39k = 3486

Now long term gains.

* 0 - 40400 is 0% so ur first 1400 of ur 180k is taxed at 0%
* leftover 178600 is 15% = 26790

Total taxed just add them up.

Easiest analogy i was told is to think of tax bracket as buckets. And income as water of different colors.

U first fill up the bucket with regular water (ordinary income. Ie most commonly from ur job) and next fill it up with red water (LTCG).

According to this, you can make exactly 40k or less per year and pay 0% on your long term capital gains. However, unlike my example with AMZN, that trade wouldn't work, it would count towards your total income and take you WAY over the 40k threshold.

But... Imagine that somebody is just living off savings. They're unemployed. They have zero income. They could then cash in on Long Term capital gains each year, to the tune of exactly 40k, and pay zero taxes on it. 

Of course, in that scenario, you'd keep rolling over long term bets into future years, not selling... but cashing it out on exactly 40k profit each near, but not earning a penny more.

That's where the media gets the rich only pay 12 percent in taxes from. 0 plus 15 plus 20 equals 35 divided by 3 brackets equals between 12 and 13 percent.

223,JD," Alibaba Bear Case

The competitive enviornment for Alibaba is fierce. Core business of Alibaba is Chinese Commerce Retail, which are revenues from Tmall and Taobao. Split the Chinese market into high end, mid tier, and lower end. Alibaba faces stiff competition from JD are the high end and Pinduoduo (PDD) at the low end. Pinduoduo also is likely to take over mid-tier are their existing low-tier customers upgrade their consumption. In regards e-commerce the top tier cities are saturated, the lower-tier cities are the future of Chinese consumption (67% of the population).  Taoboa isnt likely to beat PDD at its own game anytime soon. So why does it appear that Alibaba is growing its core commerce so much?? Consumer credit loans via ANT.  ANT shows over 253B consumer loans, about 80% of their credit products. However, regulations will likely curtail ANT's lending ability which will likely impact top-line growth for Taobao and Tmall. Its difficult to determine just how much of these consumer's loans are spent on Alibaba's platforms.

Alibaba has 2 new growth seeds (Cainiao and Cloud) but they are in early form - these are their bright spots for future growth. They also have an insane moat for big data.

248,PEP," Start with AAPL and the rest will come.

How do I decide? I like the products of the company which I buy shares from. If I like their products, that means there are many others who love their products. If there are lots of people like their products, you can't go wrong with your choice.

I wouldn't own any AAPL if  I wasn't using an Iphone. 

Same with PEP. Their cola is just superior. (I do drink Coca cola too but PEP has always something special) 

I use AMD CPU's in all of my computers both desktop and laptop. Looks like I like AMD's products too. (Would like to have some Nvidia shares but they are pricey. They are also great if you can afford the price tag.)

The past year has taught me there is no one answer. You're asking a fundamental question about consumer psychology. Why is TSLA valued at 600x PE ratio while GM and F are at 10 and 11 respectively?

Fair value is very subjective and you'll find detractors and zealots on both sides of the argument.

I primarily look at projected future revenue and industry comparative P/S multipliers. This is myopic though as there are lots of other factors that matter including debt levels, P/B ratio, etc. I'm aware of this, but since I have a day job, I can't spend all my extra time doing complicated FA for every company I want to invest.

> I am also a firm believer that you can overpay for a wonderful company. Case in point: If you would have bought MSFT at the height of the dotcom bubble, it would have taken you over 15 years to get back on green!! 

What you're talking about is not ""fair value"" but market sentiment. I think you'll never be able to reconcile the two.

For every stock you buy thats further way from rational P/S, P/E, P/B and DCF levels, the higher risk you're taking that your investment will get blown out. But those companies are also the ones that return the highest returns if you got in early.

The short answer: You can't.

The most important answer: Invest in companies you're 100% committed and convicted. Only invest in companies that you'll defend to your dying breath. That people get annoyed when you bring them up because you talk about them so much. Anything else will create doubt and give you paper hands when the stock turns the other way.

Nothing in the stock market is guaranteed. The largest most stable companies may even shake out and collapse, so investing in ETFs is really the only winning strategy over a 20 year time horizon.",radarbot,6,/r/stocks/comments/n8ieiz/how_to_value_stocks_as_a_nonprofessional/gxikbyy/,0.077,0.828,0.095,0.7577

I like to personally look at how fast revenue is growing QoQ and YoY. If revenue is growing at 50%+ YoY, companies can start seeing nose bleed valuations as investors will buy the stock today with the expectation that it will grow into its valuation in the future.

The other factor that matters a lot is P/S. When looking at revenue, if every stock was just mapped 1:1 to its current revenue, it would be an uninteresting game. P/S multiplier allow for different industries to have different mkt cap valuations despite pulling in the same revenue.


Overall, when you invest in growth companies, things can start getting out of your normal comfort zone as you'll have to justify why a company deserves to have traditional metrics that fall outside the mean.  For example: P/S multiples, willing to forgive debt ratio, focusing on subscribers/customers without focusing on profits, etc.

Also a huge factor is market sentiment. A company growing revenues 50% YoY in an uninteresting market may never see the stock price growth it deserves. Human psychology and the investing ""mob"" can move against you even if you picked a winner.


If you're looking for maximum growth, you need to first identify what markets will see the largest inflow of customers and revenue.

But most of that hype has died down in the past 3 months.

Another high growth industry right now is genetics and bioengineering. Its a market in its infancy, and with that comes lots of risks of regulation, consumer acceptance and marketization. Investing in companies like EDIT, CRSP, ILMN, NVTA, etc could yield huge returns in the next 10 years if those things go in your favour.

In the next 12 months, the biggest growth may be in housing, construction and industrials. We're seeing price inflation in raw inputs and a rotation into manufacturing due to COVID reduction. Investing in more speculative businesses in this market (ie. 3D printing, commodities, etc) may yield good returns. Maybe look at the holdings in NAIL and identify which ones have the highest revenue growth potential.

Cybersecurity is also very hot right now.

I like to personally look at how fast revenue is growing QoQ and YoY. If revenue is growing at 50%+ YoY, companies can start seeing nose bleed valuations as investors will buy the stock today with the expectation that it will grow into its valuation in the future.

The other factor that matters a lot is P/S. When looking at revenue, if every stock was just mapped 1:1 to its current revenue, it would be an uninteresting game. P/S multiplier allow for different industries to have different mkt cap valuations despite pulling in the same revenue.


Overall, when you invest in growth companies, things can start getting out of your normal comfort zone as you'll have to justify why a company deserves to have traditional metrics that fall outside the mean.  For example: P/S multiples, willing to forgive debt ratio, focusing on subscribers/customers without focusing on profits, etc.

Also a huge factor is market sentiment. A company growing revenues 50% YoY in an uninteresting market may never see the stock price growth it deserves. Human psychology and the investing ""mob"" can move against you even if you picked a winner.

It's currently overvalued if they don't rapidly expand into e-commerce and take over, and there's definitely a chance they won't. I'm not saying it won't do well, but I definitely wouldn't touch GME over 100. But you're in since 18 you're set lol, but the big returns might slow down for GME if not completely stop. I can see GME sitting between 150-200 for a while, but hey I know nothing. GME is the king of meme stocks currently so it'll likely shoot up if all the beaten down stocks go up. But GME is NOT at or anywhere near an all time low, unlike all these other stocks.

332,GME," Nah, I'm pretty confident I know what I'm talking about.

There was major rebalancing/deleveraging going on in the second half of March under all of our noses, the reason why that time period was not worse than it was for the major averages was because of the repo program and the reason why the averages have bounced fast pretty much all year really is because since there's so much unease, you get shorting and put buying on every drop. When those are closed, you get squeezes.

I would not be able to find it off the top of my head but I recently saw something that said hedge funds have apparently done their most selling ever this year (and people think they're doing it in the flashy names) and I heard an anecdote yesterday that they've been taking a ton of pain.

But really, the tl/dr point of my comment here is I am going to laugh so hard if we continue to see nothing from GME during a legit market selloff of everything that gets to the caliber of causing margin calls (which would be like June 2020, September 2020, or late October 2020). June is apparently another big rebalancing month, so it's possible that the ""everything market selloff"" finally happens then after several months of nothing, especially if the gas is eased off some on the QE.",95Daphne,1,/r/stocks/comments/n811nb/weird_things_in_the_market_ever_since_gme/gxg68h5/,0.048,0.868,0.085,0.8376

There may be value in GME because of the possibility of another squeeze, but theres no long term value as a company. At least not at the price they're trading at. Especially not in the next 10 years.

I just don't see where they add value.. I buy games from steam, game pass (the real upset in the industry), or the developer themselves. All online. There's no need for Gamestop there. Every single box store, and online shop, has access to consoles. I don't see how gamestop can take a significant enough portion of that to make a difference. Even when trying to do online trade-ins as they've mentioned.
