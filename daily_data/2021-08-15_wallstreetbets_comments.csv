6,NKLA," NKLA is actually MUCH worse than that.

**1.** Create a company whose central technology is strictly inferior to what is already on the market. 

> The theoretical maximal efficiency for creating hydrogen than using it for fuel cells is worse than Tesla batteries already on the market

**2.** Make false statements about your product to boost its stock 

> Founder Milton claimed he was producing hydrogen and was doing so at a reduced cost, when he knew that in fact no hydrogen was being produced at all by Nikola, at any cost.

**3.** Get federal charges for lying about all aspects of your business

> On July 29, Milton was charged with securities and wire fraud, as US prosecutors accused him of false and misleading statements about ""nearly all aspects of the business.""

**4.** Get a sweet deal leaving the company where the company has to pay all your legal bills.

> $8 million was set aside by Nikola for Milton’s legal bills

**5.** Fail to produce any product… ever

> Nikola has not sold any vehicles now 7 years after founding

**6.** Profit!

> Milton’s net worth is estimated to be $1.1 billion, from prior investors into NKLA. Net worth drops to $1 billion if you take out the $100 million bail for securities charges.",philosoraptor80,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p4y22z/how_to_become_a_billionaire_in_5_easy_steps/h92rid2/,0.142,0.748,0.11,-0.8687

22,DD," > Oh and the majority of customers are assholes who dont ""tip"" (really it's more of a bid) so stuff arrives cold for them.

The problem is that the Door Dash menu is +20% more expensive + $7 delivery + tip. 

So a Taco Bell order goes from $5 to $6 just on the +20% menu, to $13 after delivery to $15 on a rather small tip. 

That is 300%. 

If we're talking ""nicer"" food where the upcharge would be smaller, that is also food that I don't want to accept cold. A $30 order at a local restaurant (that goes to $36 after markup and then $43 after DD fee and then $50 after tip) better at least arrive timely and warm.",QED_2106,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p4y22z/how_to_become_a_billionaire_in_5_easy_steps/h92nuy8/,0.081,0.88,0.039,-0.6256

27,VC," That does happen, but it isn't like Angels are selling their shares to Pre-Seed, which then sells to Seed, to A, etc. ect.  Most are actually investing more into the company to keep their ownership percentages, well at least for a few rounds.  But yes, angels are the most likely to sell after the comapny gets to a B round on average.   Other than that the capital coming in is for the company and comes from selling more shares.  

As for how investors make the company successful is pretty simple. For example if you get the stamp of approval from a platform like Y Combinator it opens your company up to new clients.

34,MF," ehh, where to begin.

**Your data itself is warped around the volume of funds available. Many of which have only a tenuous relationship to your claimed comparison index, and no real market adoption.**

* For example, I could create 100 mutual funds, each of which focuses in small cap assets within a specific business sector: let's say *adult incontinence research.*
* Their total holdings would be my weekly allowance of $12 dollars.
* Your data is now garbage given that you are only looking at MF performance indiscriminate of their actual adoption in the market.

I was absolutely **s**h**o**c**k**e**d** to see that both of your data sets are victimized with this same argument.

* Both Average Fund Performance, and Fund : Benchmark Performance are useless if there is not a specified attempt at only including funds of-a-kind.

35,MSCI," A few points:
You excluded international and fixed income. Benchmark construction matters and certain benchmarks are easier to beat. Also, you are using S&P cap benchmarks and not Russell or MSCI. If a managers prospectus benchmark is not the S&P, they are going to have increased tracking error and performance may suffer as a result. These are also not risk adjusted. Other risk measures such as drawdown, skew, kurtosis, and sortino ratios may show a different picture, they may not. Also, in the case of small cap, larger funds have liquidity issues that can cause difficulty in generating alpha. Finally, trailing returns are only one data point.

54,AMC, Nice post. It's important to keep in mind that technical analysis in the case of AMC does not indicate future price action. So MACD bullish crossovers and such aren't a sure thing. Data doesn't carry much weight when the HFs don't play by the rules. There's also been lots of apes making baseless claims without any source/data to support about AMC squeezing on a certain date and have been wrong---this is also not a good thing.

191,USA," I think the real Change for war is that the enemys of the west now see us as completely incompetent and weak and abandoning the people that help the USA and they will be killed as traitors. Remember the Biden administration said there would be no way the Taliban would take the country. They took it in under a week without a single real battle to speck of.  Not to mention trying to make a country into a liberal democracy that had no interest being one. That's massive incompetence.

China might now see the west as so weak and incompetence no one will stop them from taking Taiwan and if they made that decision I think they might be right about it as well. I don't think the administration would support going to war over Taiwan or the people of the USA.

Agents are polishing the brass on the titanic. The jig is up, and the public isn’t going to swallow 6% fees. The likes of OPEN, Zillow, RedFin will scale and the cost of the transaction will come down, while agents try to convince you that you still need to pay 6% and it’s a relationship biz. Lol.

199,UK," The reason there was an opening in the US market for something like opendoor was because for some reason you guys thought that being a realtor was difficult or a respected profession or something and accepted 5% fees.

In reality that's retarded, it really isn't that difficult or expensive to market a house, in the UK fees ar usually 1% maybe rising to 1.5% if there are a ton of keen sellers, and solicitors fees are usually another 0.25%.

All that will happen with opendoor buying houses to sell is that realtors will drop their fees to where they actually should be and I suspect opendoor won't be able to outcompete them well enough to grow once that happens. As someone said, their business relies on actually buying slightly under the market value and people won't do that if realtors don't have retarded fees.

In the long term it's a positive (unless you're a realtor) because the competition will drive down costs to buy and sell houses but I don't think it's a fantastic investment.",avl0,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p4mvjg/amzn_and_open_a_case_for_bringing_the_real_estate/h90h55l/,0.085,0.845,0.07,-0.5553
