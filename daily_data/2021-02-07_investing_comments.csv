27,GME," >PE < 7 (nothing magic about 7, that's just what I decided to use as a relatively but not ridiculously low PE multiple)

Wait, I'm seeing negative earnings for GME. Are you using forward estimates, or some kind of reversion to the mean. 

I'm afraid brick and mortar just makes zero sense in this space. From a valuation standpoint, there could be some juice left to be squeezed. Or you could be projecting a pivot to a more profitable business model. But, I don't know why people are banking on this. They have no moat in any sort of pivot because it's cheap to deliver digital content (either via download or mail I suppose) so margins would be razor thin. 

I also don't understand why people are holding onto the short squeeze narrative. Almost by definition, a short squeeze will be a quick and decisive event. People that made millions and continued to hold, I just don't understand it. Or worse, bought at the top... 

There might be more price action in the near future between the battle of the shorts and longs. But I think longterm, this business as it stands is worth zero. So that's why I'm steering clear at least.

37,GME," Yes, GME, at least at pre squeeze prices, and particularly <$10, was a speculative deep value play.

At <$10 the case was that it was simply far less likely to go bankrupt than the price and short interest would seem to indicate, and a turnaround was possible but no clear turnaround thesis was in play. This type of thing is the poster child for a risky deep value investment. If something is priced for imminent bankruptcy, and simply manages to stave it off for a while, you can get 300% returns on that alone if you buy the very deepest of the dips (which takes as much intestinal fortitude as day trading, if not more).

At roughly >$10, <$30, a turnaround thesis began to appear, and confirming signals started coming one after another. While price continued to climb, so did the perceived likelihood that they were figuring out how to survive, or at least not go bankrupt within months.

At >$30, <$50, you’re mostly, in my opinion, banking on Ryan Cohen having a plan. He’s proven that he can turn a dying/stagnating business model completely in its head before. He’s made a significant investment in GME not only of capital, but time and focus as an activist investor, bringing his Chewy team with him.

You’ll notice that price kept climbing as the market rates GME’s prospects to be better and better, and the turnaround thesis from theoretically not impossible to plausible or even likely if not yet well defined.

Absolutely no one is thinking the current GME business model is the way forward, and only in need of reopening of the economy.

It’s also true that if you wait until the precise plan has been defined, communicated, executed, and is delivering results that the price would then already bake those things in.

The big gains in deep value go hand in hand with carefully considered and researched speculation, which means taking that calculated risk before anyone else is a believer.

45,DD," I bought into ARKK last fall after it already made a huge run-up from April 2020 and am still up 66% or so.   I'm now investing in other ARK funds as I can.  They are a percentage of my overall portfolio versus being 'all in' on them.  


The way I see it, while I consider myself to be pretty smart and study enough to understand what business segments are ripe for disruption, I also have enough other stuff going on in my life that I know I won't spend enough time keeping up with everything and doing the due diligence needed to really make informed decisions.   In lieu of spending time doing DD or even just mimicking what the ARK fund are doing, I'm OK investing with them and paying a premium to support the research they do.    


If you're one of those people that really gets into stock research and are willing to spend the time to DYOR and then make all of the necessary trades to avoid the premium, good for you.  I'm willing to do the research to figure out where the next areas of disruption are, and when I understand the overall market but not the players in that sector I'm happy to pay for experts' time.    


Investing comes with a cost if you do it right, and I view that cost as a spectrum where one side is 100% DYOR (i.e. spending more of your time) and the other end is paying to borrow the expertise of others (i.e. paying a higher expense ratio for actively-managed funds, hiring a financial advisor, etc.).

ARKK performed the same as or worse than basic growth funds (say VUG) with significantly more volatility in 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019. Its breakout years were 2017 and 2020.

Personally, I think buying into ARKK now is like investing in TSLA after its 2013 breakout: putting money into overbought hype that has a chance for breakout in the future. TSLA was yucky volatile underperformance for 6 years until it finally skyrocketed in 2019.",SnooRobots6193,0,/r/investing/comments/leo0ok/for_those_who_are_buying_company_stocks_to_avoid/gmguvg8/,0.071,0.85,0.078,-0.0276

65,EV," I have a gut feeling it won't be a crash, but a fizzle..but it will take time. High growth, low profitability stocks can continue to at least match S&P returns for the next 2-4 years. Take Tesla for example, they'll have no problem at all multiplying their sales 2x, 4x, up to 8x. This keeps the growth mirage alive. The real challenge comes after a few sales multiples...that starts to bring in more competitors and old guard will start to defend their turf. Toyota for example is on the sidelines but I guarantee they will be 100% EV by 2035.

Once it becomes clear that 40% annual growth is not sustainable (this will take several earnings reports), the stocks won't necessarily crash..but they'll simply underperform the rest of the market.

This all assumes that the bubble stops inflating, as of right now. If we see continued inflation in growth stocks (i.e. 20+% returns).. then yes there could be a massive crash.

My expectation is they'll pace with with the market for the next 5 years..and then underperform thereafter once old guard competitors emerge..this will start their downward trajectory.

83,NIO," I'm invested into RDS too, but mostly pre-COVID (ouch but DCA'ed into about $40 cost basis today). I'm still in somewhat because I agree with you about the energy transition play:

1. The retail play - that network is huge and not cheap to enter into in a 3-5year time span. Even if they don't produce hydrogen I think they can still be distributors. Hydrogen may not be viable for passenger vehicles but I believe the thesis by NIO is correct: [long haul trucking is more efficient being hydrogen based as opposed to traditional battery packs](https://youtu.be/7ynupYBLlyA). Not invested in NIO because I don't believe they will be the ones to pull it off. 
2. They are picking up their renewables network in wind and transitioning to an utilities slowly for some time. Renewables economics today favour the utilities (LCOE for wind has been declining), not the producer (competition increasing). If they can convince the analyst community they will become a mini-NextEra that will shoot up valuation significantly. 
3. One thing that may play out either way: their oil reserves are among the lowest of the majors and decreasing [year on year] (https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1ZT1WQ). While normally it's a bad thing but as oil slowly declines only the lowest cost (the Saudi's) and strategic producers (US shale) will remain. This means reducing capex needs that can further accelerate their transition, but the flip side is they may run out of cash before that happens.

In short, if the world takes 30 years to drastically move away from oil, Shell's dead (so will all of us actually). If it takes 10-15 to take out at least 50% of demand, this is a dividend paying 2-3 bagger.",LividCurry,4,/r/investing/comments/le8f3e/amazon_orders_700_trucks_that_run_on_natural_gas/gmbznxk/,0.072,0.836,0.091,0.5956
84,LNG," Carbon pricing is only growing and natgas companies don't make money without petroleum liquids to the extent that they do at all so I wouldn't count on LNG to save them; it has been more like a boat anchor than a life raft so far.

RDS may well survive the transition, but that doesn't mean they'll do so at anything close to their current form or scale. The thing is that the renewables industry doesn't have nearly as many barriers to entry as the petroleum industry and plenty of people have a lot fewer potentially stranded assets to keep them from moving quickly than RDS does.

I'm ok with the idea of the oil majors as dividend plays, but even aside from my moral qualms I don't see them as long-term winners at all. Transportation fuels represent a disproportionate share of demand and that's going to be plateauing and then declining at an accelerating rate (as will natural gas peakers, followed by CCGTs). There's nothing to say that the renewables industry will ever be as profitable as oil has been and the profits are going to be split a lot more ways for the foreseeable future, even before we consider the state-owned or funded enterprises that don't have to make profits at all to remain in operation.",Runningflame570,7,/r/investing/comments/le8f3e/amazon_orders_700_trucks_that_run_on_natural_gas/gmaumrq/,0.007,0.839,0.154,0.9852

So could probably add another 80% on top of your estimate if they're used efficiently.

And BP didn't make very drastic changes to their company structure, they just sprinkled around a few million euros here, a few million euros there to see if anything stuck. It didn't, they just ended up with a bunch of disconnected, low margin wind and solar farms. 

Shell is definitely taking a different approach, putting their money where their mouth is by actually selling off O&G assets and reinvesting in renewable growth areas.

97,LNG," This is directed to everyone in this line of replies since I can't decide who to reply to.

What makes LNG work, and what makes it lucrative, is simply the fact that it's stored as a liquid, which lets you increase the density by a factor of around 600. It is then heated up into gas form(CNG) and transferred to the engine. LNG is 95% methane.

Storage requires low temperatures for sure, but it's not a cryogenic system. A vacuum wall separates the outer atmosphere from the inner tank, preventing temperature changes. Refueling is a bit more complicated compared to pure CNG, but in the end, I still think the fuel efficiency and the fact that it's stored as a liquid make it a cost-effective endeavor.

CNG tanks require routine inspections (at least in the country I live in) for methane leakage whereas it's still a grey area for LNG since they don't have the same working pressure.

The biggest downside of LNG is probably the high costs of assembly and parts. I don't know if the saved fuel costs outweigh the cost of assembly in a reasonable timespan.",cedra_,5,/r/investing/comments/le8f3e/amazon_orders_700_trucks_that_run_on_natural_gas/gmfctub/,0.043,0.895,0.062,0.5499
98,LNG," The main difference between LNG and what we think of as standard natural gas is storage and transportation. LNG has added value because it is compressed and significantly more volume can be moved using less overall space. It's the whole reason you could even run it in a truck. That being said, you are right, natural gas in general is a by-product in today's world. There is the argument that as oil declines, wells are closed, and this by-product declines steeply in supply as the world is potentially looking to it for a transportation fuel. Who knows.

Also, its worth noting that LNG is far more relevant for Europe who is currently dependent on Russia for natural gas. Compress it in North America, ship it across the sea, and they are potentially willing to pay a premium for the source. In NA we are flush with natural gas, it has little profit here.

100,CCS," So I read through a big chunk of it and think their analysis is entirely too convenient for their own market position. There's a big emphasis on hydrogen, continued use of natural gas, and carbon capture sequestration (which they refer to as CCUS). They're even projecting oil as a significant chunk of primary energy come 2050 which I doubt since the economics get worse rapidly as transportation and heating use falls.

Hydrogen has been hyped for literally decades, but has seen very little uptake since it's expensive (cost and energy-wise), complicated, and potentially dangerous due to it being highly reactive and stored under pressure. CCS has seen basically no real world successes, it hurts EROEI, and it's not even settled science that carbon will stay put underground. Natural gas isn't exactly profitable, battery storage is rapidly undermining its role and economics (basically no gas peaker plants are being built today), and without working CCS the economics of it and blue hydrogen both get crushed further.

There are some other things I take issue with in it (projections for nuclear or biomass, the breadth of areas where even green hydrogen might compete, some solar and wind numbers), but the main gist of my complaint is the areas they see for themselves I mostly don't think will actually wind up being there for them.",Runningflame570,2,/r/investing/comments/le8f3e/amazon_orders_700_trucks_that_run_on_natural_gas/gmbld4l/,0.136,0.812,0.052,-0.9662

* Intangible assets such as brand and a loyal customer base are not captured in the book value.  Apple has an amazing brand.
* Debt is on the raise.  D/E has increased from 25% to >100% in last 5 years
* It is over valued.  I think it's a mistake to compare AAPL to FANGs/techs.  AAPL makes expensive consumer hardware and therefore is not eligible for the same kinds of economies/margins as software or ad sales. For example AAPL has a PE ratio 2-3x Samsung.",z109620,26,/r/investing/comments/leqkpb/companies_with_low_pe_high_pb_ratio/gmhbqsq/,0.051,0.742,0.207,0.9349
133,MSFT," You got it u/GazBB. And as mentioned prior tech (particularly software) is always going to favor a lower book. 

What I find interesting is that FASB (The artists who mind the GAAP I believe?) looks at software product lifecycle in three modules viability, dev, and distribution. For the dev portion, they can capitalize this as a noncurrent asset, assuming there are/is physical assets associated  whether plant (components manufacturing contract) or devices (like iPhone) themselves that can have an avg. useful life est. and ammortization schedule assigned. 

So when, MSFT published windows 10 you would see assets explode as this is beginning the launch of a three-year amortization against a high-value asset. The beauty being of course that the liability column, in this case, is for work that has already been executed (less noncurrent inputs to production for manufacturing, but in MSFT case - Dell+ other OEMs bear that inventory risk). 

Moral being if its software (Apple's a software company now, IMO) increasing assets means that the operating risk of investing human capital to a failed project is now in terms of total risk decreased relative to periods where the Asset column is at a trough.... but, you can't really act on that though and the risk I am referencing is only marginally mitigated, as one can ship a working product that sees no adoption, or negative customer value (airdrop for example). So, therefore this increase in assets you see is balanced in liabilities (though not in accounting nor on the balance sheet) by the time value and market mover sacrifices already ""spent"" when the engineers built the application. 

Far from a source doc but if you want to read more into the GAAP capitalization of intangables take a look, enough to inform [https://smallbusiness.chron.com/gaap-require-research-development-costs-recorded-81411.html](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/gaap-require-research-development-costs-recorded-81411.html)",BigTechiewVice4Value,0,/r/investing/comments/leqkpb/companies_with_low_pe_high_pb_ratio/gmhu0zt/,0.082,0.815,0.103,-0.0946
134,AAPL," **Arguments for multiple expansion of Samsung relative to Apple**

Wouldn't it also be fair to say though that AAPL has services (software) revenue that is orders of magnitude higher than Samsung? 

Samsung is hardware only and does not will never ever have an app store (Google ships' sailed). Do they have a rev sharing agreement with Google I wonder? App Store is the terraform of AAPL rev, and the epitome of a platform's network effects in action. 

Android OS is open source thus providing no moat for Samsung phone sales, not to imply that Galaxy/Notes do not have brand loyalty, they do. IMSO, not to the same degree as the iPhone ecosystem. 

**Arguments against sizing into position at this price** 

Anything discounted over 20+ yrs to break even, with economic uncertainty from COVID unabashed, plus the weight of gravity pulling on the largest market cap company on the planet in general

Eventually, price appreciation would be limited to the desire of institutions and retail to have a degree of certainty so high on AAPL to increase their cost basis while at this multiple. Coming out of a stock split and a new release. Gravity eventually leads a mass of a certain magnitude to implode on itself, right.  

Currently, AAPL is at 6.7 percent of the S&P. I know that there are always big winners but I do believe this is the highest concentration in the top ten names since 99'. Of course, this is not 99'. These are the best businesses in the world today, albeit priced to perfection.

Potential regulation abounds. Lawsuits underway. No one is feeling sorry for them. I love Tim Cook and AAPL... even still, is it in the spirit of a free market to allow them to take a apx. 50 percent rake from devs for each app downloaded? Not too sure. 

Potential for last mover advantage. Satya and the enterprise machine launched an ultra-premium convertible into the Surface lineup in the past fiscal. Unsure of the consumption results but, fantastic beachhead strategy. Microsoft brand well established in the enterprise and I believe there is potential to move downmarket in the future as inputs to production reach economies of scale and awareness from a heavily funded ad campaign converge.

As a pure foundry play I still like TSMC more since they're of national importance to Taiwan and should have a very strong lead at least for the next couple of years but it is possible for Samsung to surpass them if they figure out GAAFET first.

194,CORE,"  

I  am a 19yo and maxing my 401k with 85% VTWAX and 15% ARKK. As for my  401k - my employer contributes 7.5% for free without any matching from  me. It's only a job through college so that 7.5% won't be a whole lot of  money, but why not set it up properly.

The fund choices in my 401k, and recommended allocation are as follows:  
[https://imgur.com/a/ABeC8Ff](https://imgur.com/a/ABeC8Ff)  


As to what I want to know

1. Are either of these allocations reasonable?

Ben Felix Inspired: (Main option for now)

DFSIX  - DFA US SUSTAINABILITY CORE 1 (50%) DFSPX - DFA INTL SUSTAINABILITY  CORE 1 (25%) DFVEX - DFA US Vector Equity I (10%) DFCEX - DFA Emerging  Markets Core Equi... (10%) DFGEX - DFA Global Real Estate Securit...  (5%)

My initial choices:

60% DFSIX 30% DFSPX 10% DFCEX

2) Should the sustainability funds be swapped for:

DURPX - US High Relative Profitability, DFIEX - International Core Equity

I  chose sustainability funds initially because I preferred their top  holdings and sector split, but that may be a really stupid way to  choose.

3)

Could  either of my allocation choices be way better with the addition or  subtraction of any available fund on that post in the screenshot.

Specifically Small Cap Value US and Small Cap International Funds, or International Vector Equity?

4)

I was told these funds are actually really good, would it make sense to contribute to the 401k *instead of*  maxing my Roth IRA even if there's no employer match just for access to  these funds? (Employer contributes 7.5% without match). Or is my Roth  IRA better? (Mainly VTWAX) - Initially I'm thinking that Roth is better  because my tax rate is really low, but maybe not?

5)

Anything else I'm missing?

222,GME," The GME bonanza had spiked my interest in trading. I’ve spent the last week or so watching tutorials and getting familiar. I understand bracket orders and limit orders, and have become really excited about the prospect of investing. In my mind it seems pretty simple. Using a commission free service I feel like I should be able to pop in and out of stocks and using bracket orders set margins of just a percent or two to make small gains and this could add up to a significant return over time. I suppose this would label me as a swing trader? I’d like to automate the process as much as possible as I work a lot and have a toddler, hence the bracket orders.

I opened a think or swim account and I’m just a bit overwhelmed with the amount of studies available, and the time frame options for the app. My question is, 1: does my strategy sound solid, and 2: do any of you have a recommendation for a good set of tutorials/videos that can explain the basics?

227,DD," I’m not sure if this is too much to ask, but I am interested in getting more into investing and would love to know the thought process and steps someone takes to do a solid DD. Cheesecake Factory $CAKE seems like a good investment to me, since they are known more as a dine in restaurant as opposed to to go food. Also in July 2019 they purchased Fox Restaurant Group, I worked for one of these restaurants and they deliver very high end delicious food and a great experience to boot. They have a great variety of restaurants who all seem to nail it and did amazing volume pre covid. They thrive on the dine in experience is my main point and reason to believe they will pop once covid is behind us. So my question is to anyone who knows how to read into a company’s stock and knows what to look for when investing (if you have the time and dont mind), is this a company worth investing into or not, and if you could walk us through what numbers and things you look at while making your decision.

Hello fellow humans,

I am brand new to reddit so please be gentle :) Came in with the GME Wave first to WSB, than to [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) after few days. I trade stocks in EU since 4 years, doing around 20 annual trades with around 20 - 30 % profits so far. My trades were gut guided and most of them buying dips and hoping for rebound. Last week a friend of mine approached me with some questions on how to buy/sell stocks and asked what I think about KHC. I could not give a proper answer on that, because I hesitate on giving monetary advice based on my gut feeling. In Wiki section I discovered the [fundamentals post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post) and decided it is time to learn a little bit. So I thought I will try to ""analyze"" KHC according to the basic terms mentioned there in order to get a better understanding.

If you have some time I am happy to receive feedback and advice. I tried to get to a conclusion if it is a plus or a minus regarding an investment.

**My Understanding:** Current Market Cap of 41,325B which places it as a Large Cap according to [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/market-capitalization-defined/). So it would have a decent amount of people trading and would fit for long term investment.

The question marks I have is comparing the Market Cap to the Enterprise Value of 67.25B (Calculated by Yahoo with mystery formula?), but also if checking the balance sheet it is lower than own capital of 51,6B. on Yahoo there is Value Book Value Per Share: (mrq)40.24 Does it mean that the company is undervalued at current price?

I also took a look on the Breakdown of Holders and Berkshire Hathaway, Inc has around 26% so Warren expects it to be a good investment? But also could be impacting the stock in Major way (positive?).

**My Understanding:** So if they earned 1,58 but payed out 1,60 in 2019 does it mean, that they gave out 2 cents per share more than they earned? If the case, it seems bad to me.  
2020 is much better than 2019, If the forecast is added it look like this: 0,58+0,8+0,7+0,74(estimated)=2,8

I’m 30, live in the UK, earn $92,000 (.  I’m saving around $2,300 a month of $4,800 taken home.

-	12.5% equities (ETF)
-	2.5% mad money (stock picks)
-	5% commodities (gold and silver)
-	5% bonds

251,AI," Hi Seperate Summer!

I am a fairly new investor, but the efforts you have made to start with and bring yourself up to speed sound great, good work!

The one point that jumps out at me from your post is your reference to your work for a company developing software utilising AI / cloud. I think it would be very sensible to use your knowledge of the field to support stock picking for companies active in that field. You still need to apply due diligence to stock picks, but you could use what you know to significantly help narrow down the field?

In my portfolio I have started blending ETFs with individual stock picks to balance risk with opportunity.

Obviously all the above is just my opinion and I am a stranger on the internet. It is important to do your own research.",MarquessR,1,/r/investing/comments/lejph1/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gmewt87/,0.017,0.813,0.17,0.9776

It's up 50% now so keep that in mind. If I came across this, more people did and it can be 'too late' to hop on if future growth is calculated in already... I don't know if this is true, i looked at in at that time and then forgot about it.... if we do go back to normal and telehealth is not being adopted, the stock could fall, there is also competition. Dont bet to much on a forced necessity is what i'm sayin i guess.

My understanding of the American healthcaremarket is not enough so more insights would be nice :)

In the Netherlands I think tele-healthcare is here to stay but the quality is still poor. The only reason why hospitals adopted is, is because the insurere changed the rules and is now paying almost as much as for s physial consult.

During this time there was market manipulation to keep the stock at 4.05 until the completed the purchase of shares from these institutions.

311,TSLA," Well here are my Reality Tips for all you investors: 

1) There's no such thing as a ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity.

2) There are rare exceptions like TSLA, but the rule is that trends take years to develop and decades to play out.  You won't miss the boat by waiting a day or a week to buy.  It takes a long time to cross the ocean.

3) There are new market opportunities arising all the time, almost every day.  If you're not sure of something, go small or pass.  There will be another opportunity to buy, add or find something else.  

4) small mistakes are easy to fix.  Big mistakes aren't.

Those low, unducted rotors will pose a huge safety issue.  Not to mention the prohibition on Chinese drone technology  (the Communist party is likely an investor in eHang) will make it very difficult.....

  Be wary of many of the UAM concepts...the ones that really will make it (at least in the US) will be the ones that truly understand what it means to type certify a platform.   Best quote ever from the Vertical Flight Society is  ""designing an aircraft is really easy if you don't know what you're doing"".   I've seen so many powerpoint concepts that are just trash.

Pure autonomous aircraft in the US are a long way off...     the approach will be piloted first but with decreasing responsibility of the pilot  (i.e. from ""pilot"" to manager) and over time the human will do less and less.   Once the FAA can understand how to type certify AI and it can be proven to be reliable  (i.e.  a catastrophic failure in the 1e-09 flight hour range) then you'll see autonomous people carrying aircraft in the US.

326,LMND," ""People are scratching their heads, at the current valuation and why shorting the company doesn't work.""

That's absolutely not unique to LMND and isn't something that I'd say is a point in its favor. It's the market broadly.",dvdmovie1,1,/r/investing/comments/lecsiz/why_im_confident_lmnd_is_going_to_be_a_10100x/gmeaff9/,0.0,0.93,0.07,0.4019
327,LMND," LMND will be around for a while and be successful. They focus on being consistent and steadily growing. It takes 25% of its premium income to cover expenses. Then it uses 75% of other other to purchase reinsurance policies to limit loss.

Plus they have a ""giveback"" program and in 2020 donated over $1.1 mil. So if you like companies that try to also do good. LMND may be for you.

Their customer base in 2020 grew more than 84% and their customers are spending about 17% more on premiums while at the same time they've reduced the amount they have spent on premiums by 67%. So more profits.

Other things going for them:

* COVID-19
* They are expanding internationally
* They have a long-term focus in a market that requires it

They are a good long-term investment.

328,LMND," Hey OP, idk why there is so much hate with LMND in this sub but I 100% agree with you. People bring up many reasons to trash LMND, but after evaluating the quality of their management (vision and experience), their business model (ability to scale, super fast onboarding & claims, superior underwriting and potential to transit from reinsurance to holding float, I could go on), I concluded that lemonade is truly a 10x company for this decade. It's normal to have many haters when a young company has yet to prove itself, just like Tesla was so hated just 2 years ago.

That being said, I think the valuation of LMND is stretched atm, I wouldn't buy more unless it drops below 100. My position is 175@$59.55.",hijfork,2,/r/investing/comments/lecsiz/why_im_confident_lmnd_is_going_to_be_a_10100x/gmcu41t/,0.107,0.752,0.141,0.7106

340,LMND," This is important but right now large companies have so much access to capital they can just buy out anything that might be seen as a threat. The abundance of low rates and current popularity of venture cap and ""disrupter"" stocks means companies like LMND could probably survive through loans, equity offerings and such until either they become the company they want to be or get acquired by another company.",Whiteboard_Knight,3,/r/investing/comments/lecsiz/why_im_confident_lmnd_is_going_to_be_a_10100x/gmbzee4/,0.09,0.783,0.127,0.25
341,TSLA," Stock price is fundamentals + potential future gains (+ hype).

Let's say TSLA is only worth $300/share based on it's ""fundamentals"" (earnings), maybe you can realistically add an extra $400 based on potential future earnings and another $150 based on hype (which I'll broadly define as people piling in for reasons other than pure earnings potential of their core car business).   


So the $850 price tag is ""justified"" all factors included, but if you only look at fundamentals the price is absurd. (totally made up the #s here btw, haven't done due diligence on this % breakdown)

342,BFI," *it's becoming an achievable target to grow its valuation from $15B to $450B.*

You realize that's significantly bigger than Visa and Walmart, both of whom actually make money, right?

*Yet BFI is also becoming a 'delivery-only' disruptor in some markets selling on Grubhub, Doordash and others without a physical location.*

Surely what every delivery market needs is another provider of $15 cold hamburger and soggy fries meals. If you're going to have a mediocre burger experience by having it delivered, why not stick to McDonald's or Burger King? At least that way you get what you're paying for and for most people, the travel time is short enough that the buns and fries might actually survive.",ra__account,16,/r/investing/comments/leq7j4/potential_30baggers_for_this_decade_open_ozon_bfi/gmh1oh0/,0.024,0.956,0.02,-0.1195

How does BFI operate in a market using third party delivery fulfillment (Grubhub, Doordash, etc) without having a physical location? Did you mean to say without a physical retail location?

Can you also explain how being delivery only is disruptive when food delivery has been around for decades? What disruption is occurring when you are using the exact same delivery methods to deliver the same food as your competition?

How does BFI use third party delivery services (Grubhub, Doordash, etc) differently than larger & more established names who have significantly deeper pockets that has led to BFI being able to “consistently have great food delivered”?

There are obviously benefits to not having to lease/own, and operate a retail location. How this translate to increasing BFI’s market share in the more competitive and lucrative markets? Why would people start ordering food delivery from BFI when they have never seen a physical location?

Lastly, even if they do have the best burger delivery process in the world right now, how long can this remain a competitive advantage that justifies a “possible 30 bagger” valuation? 

Do you seriously think McDonalds & BK are asleep at the wheel and don’t have a slew of food scientists on staff that are constantly researching better and more efficient techniques to retain their position near the top of the constantly evolving fast food market?

\- DRIV (Global.X)

Couldn't pick one over the other because they both seem to be good choices, so I am going for both. Below are the pros/cons of each of them (IMHO):

DRIV

Pros:

Stronger performance vs ECAR Good allocation to IT and Materials sectors as long as companies in such spaces are involved in manufacturing components for EVs. So here the pro is that it captures also the return from Tech and rising commodities like Lithium.

Cons:

Higher TER (0.68%) It might overlap other investments that I have in automation and robotics. 

ECAR

Pros:

Lower TER (0.40%) Focus on the Auto sector (big names are Car manufacturers)

Cons:

But I do want to know what a broader group on Reddit has to say about these large companies because it’s getting harder and harder to find what people actually think about them as opposed to some motley fool shillery or “top ten reasons why AMZN is always a good buy” I’m interested in the comments more than the DD.,BestUCanIsGoodEnough,-1,/r/investing/comments/lebis8/i_am_so_bored_of_hearing_your_dd_in_some_random/gmcab3u/,0.071,0.806,0.122,0.4417

368,BP," Funny you mention it. I'm toying on a post for BP and Exxon. I was fortunate enough to buy a small bite of Exxon at a lucky point on Monday (proof: https://imgur.com/a/C0nSajm). Kicking myself for not being ballsier, but happy for what i got. I was working my way around to talking about it on here, but now I'm thinking there are broadly opportunities in oil in general.

Oil is up 55 dollars a barrel. When it was 65 dollars a barrel, BP was worth 2x what it is right now. And it's STILL giving a yield of 7% now even with the dividend slash. Exxon, people just underestimated the skill of its leadership and the strength of its balance sheet and ability to cut back on capex. Which is silly given that Exxon is like... the most profitable company in the world most years. Historically they're very well run.",Astralahara,1,/r/investing/comments/lebis8/i_am_so_bored_of_hearing_your_dd_in_some_random/gmbfic2/,0.047,0.748,0.205,0.9767
