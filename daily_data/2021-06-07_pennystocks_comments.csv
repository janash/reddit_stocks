I know nothing of the play, but find it interesting a company called ""ALASKA Peregrine development company"" says in the press release... 

""APDC do not have the technical acumen nor operational expertise to add value in a remote  
Alaskan context.""

The irony of having the name ""ALASKA"" and then saying you are don't know what you are doing in Alaska oil exploration.

Does this mean the company is some dummy company that was set up for this specific project.  Who owns this company is the question?  Any background

In any fashion looks like more dilution for the current shareholders. 14 million dollars at current price of 0.016 means 875, 000, 000 NEW shares.
