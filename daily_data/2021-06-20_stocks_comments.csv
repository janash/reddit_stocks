1,AP," Have you tried looking at the share price of each company in the ETF? Although it reduces risk to buy a single ETF, it would be interesting to know if the ETF itself trades at a higher cost than just investing in each company partially. The ETF could be adding a premium since they don't have to correlate, it's just expected that they do. In fact, if they don't correlate the AP, I believe is what they are called, can just issue more ETFs to correct the price, and they make a profit of that too. Not too knowledgeable on this topic, just wanted to throw it out there. The term you would look for is correcting NAV value I think.

4,MSFT," An ETF is just a basket of stocks that trades with its own stock symbol and has some overhead cost.

Some ETFs are narrow (e.g. about 37% of VGT is MSFT and AAPL), and some are wide (e.g. VT owns like... *everything*)

So there's no straightforward answer...  It depends on what you want exposure to.  VOO gives you lots of market-cap weighted exposure to most of the largest American companies.  If that's exactly what you want, no need to search elsewhere, you're done.  If you want to change your exposure, then you can search for other ETFs that either do exactly what you want, or simply buy multiple ETFs to make your own basket, weighted however you want.

e.g. Want heavier weighting in tech?  throw in some VGT.  Want bond exposure?  BND.  Want International exposure? VXUS.  And so on.",MattieShoes,2,/r/stocks/comments/o3p9lk/is_a_single_etf_good_enough/h2dpx1n/,0.034,0.89,0.076,-0.2725

6,DD," Just to offer a contrary opinion to the first few comments... ETFs are a great way to pick up a bunch of loser companies along with your winners. The best way to accumulate wealth is through a consolidated and actively traded portfolio. Pick 10 companies you like for the long term and follow them closely. As time goes on, consolidate your money into the best preforming 3-7 companies. 

Obviously stonk selection is very important with this sort of trading strategy so make sure you do your DD before investing. Sadly, entire generations were tricked into thinking that volatility equates to risk and that risk can be mitigated by diversification. In reality, positively trending volatile stonks produce significantly more wealth when actively traded. ETFs are the lazy way to consistently make a measly 8%.

35,SLS," I am 100% sure Boeing will survive. They however have many short therm issues.

Boeing has a massive and systematic management problem.

The 737 Max disaster was caused by management (not listening to test pilots). The resulting issues were also not handled very well. It was not a good idea to change from a CEO with an engineering background, to a CEO with a finance background.

There have been several reports of tools and other debris being found in new 787 Dreamliner fuel tanks. Some Air lines have even decided to not accept aircraft from one of the production sites. (this is also a management issue).

Boeing failed to get a Gateway Logistics System Contact because their bid did not meet basic selection criteria. 

Boeing failed to get a Human landing system contract, because their bid was massively overpriced, and relied on an unrealistic launch and development schedule of the SLS rocket.

The SLS rocket has several Issues. Boeing is lucky that Congress wants SLS to continue to exist because if NASA would decide, the chance that it already would have been cancelled is relatively high. Boeing is building the core stage of the SLS Rocket. Due to massive schedule and cost overruns, the Exploration upper stage was delayed (also built by Boeing). With Several commercial super heavy-lift rockets coming operational, the need for SLS is shrinking. Especially if the Starship system manages to work, it will be difficult to justify keeping SLS online.

The Starliner Capsule is massively delayed for several reasons, including a failed test flight 1.5 years ago. The Test might finally be repeated this year. the Issues were caused by a massive lack of testing, which, again, is a management issue. A total of 84 issues were found AFAIK.

I am not really up to date on the military contracts of Boeing.

There are several problems resulting from what I wrote above.

For a long time, Boeing got NASA contracts for ""Past mission performance"". With the Problems in the SLS Programm, as well as the Starliner programme, this is no longer the case. The Starliner contract was awarded to Boeing, mostly due to past performance. It is safe to say, that if the same competition to build a crew capsule would take place today, Boeing would not have gotten the contract at the wanted price. 

Fixing the Problems in the 737 Max has cost a lot of money. Since they had to continue to pay many of the subcontractors to prevent them from going bankrupt. I am not 100% sure, but I think they also had to pay some airlines and the family members of the victims.

With the change of the CEO some time ago, they have also restarted the design of the NMA or 797 Airliner, for the 3rd time. This will no doubt have cost a lot of money.

Airbus on the other hand didn't have these issues, which cost a lot of money and has instead used it to develop new technologies.

In my Opinion, Airbus also has a better small Aircraft lineup.

starting small, airbus has the a220 Series, which they got from bombardier, for a very low price, mainly because Boeing wanted to prevent delta from building the Plane. (relatively long story, can explain more if someone is interested). the a220 Series is very efficient, and its main drawback right now is that the production volume is too low. Airbus is however working on increasing the production speed. The a220-100 and a220-300 are more efficient than the 737 Max 7, and it is speculated that Airbus is working on a stretched a220, the a220-500. (the a220 series is so good, that most airlines are preferring it over the a319). This a220-500 would likely compete with the 737 Max 8. The 737 Max 7, 8, 9 and 10 are competing with the a319, a320 and a321. the Aircraft are pretty evenly matched, with the a321 being a bit larger than the Max 10, and with significantly more range, depending on the configuration. the a321 is also already certified, unlike the 737 Max 10, which just hat its maiden flight.

Airbus is building and delivering large numbers of a320 Airliners and has gotten many orders for the a321LR and a321XLR. Boeing does not have anything to offer in that area of the market. 

It is Rumoured that airbus might develop a new wing for the a320 family, which would increase the efficiency, as well as allowing the a321 to be stretched to an a322. Boeing would not be able to stretch the 737 Max 10 further, so would need to respond with a clean sheet design. depending on the financial situation of Boeing, they might not be able to respond quickly.

What is keeping Boeing alive, is that the Airbus order book is even longer than Boeings. If you could get an airbus aircraft quickly, way more orders would have switched from 737 max to a320neo.",marc020202,20,/r/stocks/comments/o47os2/boeing_future/h2g3mb4/,0.068,0.873,0.059,0.344

Unless things pick up fast they may need further restructuring (they already fired a bunch of employees and did some overhauling of operations in 2020).

Tourism is reopening and they have a solid contractual backlog of $340 billion, however China is a significant part of that.

Dont forget, every MAX they looked at, EVERY single one has FOD problems....

Let that sink in...

The 777X has been even more of a sales dud, and is years overdue...there are so many initial problems with the aircraft, at this point, it may NEVER see commercial flight...

The 787 has been a disaster, recently began shipping aircraft again after 8 months of stoppage due to manufacturing errors...the 800 already shipped will have to be sent back for major retrofits... more $$$$ to BA

Now we find out BA never fixed the front landing gear issue, and it reloies on ground crew to fix a pin at the gate (and then removed it before TO) or the nose gear collapses....another jopb well done!

BA lost it when they did not go through with the Embraer deal...they lost a bunch of young experienced engineers the desperately need....

BA backed out of the C series aircraft, letting Airbus take it and become a major threat to BA...launching a brand new aircraft, the A220 series...

As one can see...they have been relying on 737 and 777 sales..

The 777 was a solid AC, had some issues, but wasnt bad...the 777MAX with the folding wings is a disaster, even BA knows this...the rear tail stability has basically prevented the aircraft from even testing procedures...the aspect ratio simply wont work, and no software patch is gonna fix that...

the 777-300 already had tail issues, and the software  patch, to flutter the tail, makes the rear pax and crew sick...

The 737 should have been retired back around 2010...yet when the A320NEO slammed them to the tarmac, rather than a new AC which should have been in the works for years, they basket cased the MAX...the rest is history...

Other divisions:Military:The BA Tanker...well...who needs info on how much BA has lost on this debaucle...add to that the continued FOD problems...BA clean up your crap!

49,BA," BA is bankrupt. All the airlines are bankrupt as well. Which is just a consideration when determining if new planes are needed. 

BA has 18 billion in negative shareholder equity. They are a zombie company with $62 billion in long term debt. if you sell all of their assets today they still have 18 billion in debt. It will take them 47 years at 2019 earnings to get to their current valuation. Fucking absurd. Without government bailouts (and the fed propping up the market) BA doesn’t exist. If there ever is a liquidity crisis BA cannot refinance they file for bankruptcy protection (this won’t mean their stock goes to zero but it’s possible). 

It’s a sad state when such a shit company with rancid management can exists but alas c’est la vie. Just patiently waiting for the fed to remove eight trillion from their balance sheet and raise rates to 5% so BA can finally go away. 

Northrop and Lockheed will be happy to pick up their government contracts so BA’s military or national security dependency is moot.

This is a pretty solid post and one of the reasons I'm so bullish on fintech companies.

Millennials do have money, and wealth, and one could argue Gen z, who is behind them, has been the first generation to get introduced this heavily into investing, this young. Regardless of how this happened or what they're doing now, investing early means learning early. And that'll pay off in the long run.

So despite the pessimism that engulfs social media, when it comes to Millennials/Gen z and money. Look where they put it.

Because even if they don't have a lot now, banks are sticky as fuck, and what they do with it now is likely what they will do with it when they are 60 and actually have wealth.

So I'm not looking at BAC and JPM, their boomer banks. All the boomers have their money there, because they've had their money there since they were kids, and two things scare boomers. Change and buttons.

But Millennials/Gen Z are putting their money into companies like Sofi, not BAC and not Wells Fargo. That is the choice they are making now, and that is super bullish for companies like these over the next 40 years. 

It starts with a checking account, maybe a savings, maybe a peer to peer transfer. 

Then they are getting car loans, home loans, and have IRA's and millions of dollars of networth tied to them.

98,HITI," None of these. HITI is the outright best player in Cannabis right now and it will dominate the industry worldwide. After that, I think Cresco will do extremely well. I like Canopy too, then Green Thumb and Tilray. However, again HITI shits on every one of these companies and it will be trading in the $400 range in 6 years. Weedmaps is...interesting. Need to do more research on them. It is truly amazing that people do not know about the company with the largest overall footprint in the world right now, which is HITI. Blows my mind.

There is some manipulation going on and it needs more volume and awareness. It was OTC and flew under the radar and it is Canadian and brick and mortar. However, like a third of their sales come from the US through E-Commerce with CBD and and the 5,000 skus they have (like 75% of which are made in house). They also have drop shipping. They have the largest E-Commerce presence in the world man and they are truly going to dominate this space. The CEO is a beast and the team is very dynamic. They have positive adjusted EBITDA (hardly any cannabis retailer has this). They made great deals and the debt is constantly restructured and every loan gets turned into shares. They have around 90 stores and will have 115 EOY. They consistently scale. This quarter might be rough due to lockdowns, but it is fine. They trade 1.4 times 2022 consensus estimates compared to a pretty trash peer group that trades at 8x that with completely shit numbers. Dilution went down by a good amount recently.

HITI will also likely acquire a retail company that is already up and running in the US. Maybe they can link deals with e-commerce and bricks in the US.

VIAC streaming service, Paramount+, is the second best streaming service that exists right now. Only beat by Disney+.

Having the rights to march madness and NFL, including the superbowl is a HUGE cash cow and should not be understated.

The only reason the price is this low is because certain companies had to liquidate their positions rapidly in VIAC, driving down the price. It should and will recover rapidly once it does. Why it hasn't already is probably because of some price suppression, maybe because a few other companies might need to liquidate their position in VIAC too which will drive it down further, and/or because the price was being inflated a bit with options when it was near 100$.

The fore IMO you have to play a speculative timing game if you purchase and when to sell. They rest on their laurels and don’t try anything new or innovative. They’ve finally come to grips with that a bit and are turning things around but only by copying other incumbents. The entire history of the relationship is ridiculous and raises the question of whether it’ll happen again. They don’t have a ton of modern “hits”. They have a decent number of solid performing shows and movies but very few that people are passionate about. The sport contracts they have are largely not recurring in nature so the total content available isn’t by sports isn’t high (high quality sports though) so usage rates won’t be as high as competitors Disney or NBC. They have too many platforms which is confusing and expensive for users (Pluto, showtime, paramount) and user experience hasn’t been good for any.

171,IRL," You ordered it correctly. But to reiterate what you are saying:

Call: You have the right to buy 100 shares
Put: You have the right to sell 100 shares

To illustrate. It’s best represented when someone does something **uncovered or naked**:

If you **sell a call naked** (not a covered call), and it gets exercised, then you have a short position in your portfolio. Since you don’t have the shares, you “sell to open” and are -100 shares of the stock. 

If you have 100 shares already, you would not have a short position as there are no additional shares to sell (*thats a covered call*).

If you **bought a naked put** and you exercise it and it makes it to expiry, then you also have a short position because your broker “sells to open” and you have -100 shares of the stock. 

If you have 100 shares already, you would not have a short position as there are no additional shares to sell.

So **selling puts and buying calls** are the opposite. If either trade is exercised at expiry or by the option buyer, then you are long +100 shares.  If you are buying calls or selling puts naked, it generally means that you do not have the capital to cover if it gets exercised and would probably get a margin call if overextended.

187,HUGE," I was in T for a while for the dividends.  LOTS of elderly boomers got into T decades ago, and the dividend has and continues to provide them with a nice income.  I thought I'd enjoy the same; however, their debt frightens me and many years of stagnation even decline are not impressive.  It's like I'm paying my cut of the dividend from my own capital, but also paying a very, very, very expensive top-heavy group of triple letter executives millions for the same, along with all of the elderly early adoption boomers.  My speculation is that when that dividend gets cut, along with the fact that such a large segment of long-time retired people are invested, many will just dump it.  They don't want to lose their capital (even MORE of their capital) AND their dividend, and they'll move to safer havens.

Now, that speculation aside, I started reflecting on their business and my experience with AT&T over decades.  They suck.  They've ripped me off more than once with their cellular service gouging and their internet service.  Even today, after getting subsidies from tax payers to expand their network, they still deliver the worst internet service.  Meaning, I don't buy it.  They might say they are expanding and improving, just like they did decades ago, but when I drive around town I don't see modern AT&T crews and installers.  I don't see AT&T at all.  I see other fiber companies.  So, there again, I think AT&T is a washed up has-been slowly milking their aging loyal customers to death.  This psychology is further reflected in their idiotic decision to invest in satellite.  They are completely out of touch or something else worse is going on.  Also, I'm somewhat of a technical professional, and I used to be able to see their main trunks, the HUGE fiber lines connecting states and countries.  They don't even appear to be a significant player in that area anymore.  So, all in mind, I still think, ""ok, what about their venture into owning the media as well, their Warner bros and HBO Max deals"". With that in mind I think about my media consumption habits and those I've observed in extended family.  None of us give a shit.  There are so many options for fair entertainment now, and we're all tapped out on subscriptions.  No one is wanting yet another streaming subscription.

So, what am I left with for a reason to invest in them?  Fancy debt restructuring with hope that they'll change their ways? Offloading of assets that they never could figure out how to make money from?  What are they truly innovating, doing to set themselves apart, to add true value, to inspire, to grow, to adapt?  I'm drawing blanks here.  The answer for me is ""nothing"".  They create nothing, and are just slowly bleeding and my opinion is the top will milk the remaining wealth out of it and retire leaving the rest of investors holding empty bags and a ever diminishing dividend.

So, there ya go, another random internet person's opinion.

Edit: What will the new dividend be?  If they get down to around $10 to $15 a share and the dividend return climbs back to +7% I might give them another look, but I still think it's a significant risky play till we can see something truly innovative coming out of AT&T.  They need to think outside their crumbling box, maybe tap into some new ventures with gaming and theaters and create new types of markets.  They're really missing the ball here, with all the advances in tech, by floundering around chasing and copying other people's/businesses ideas.",timeistheonlymoney,1,/r/stocks/comments/o3te7f/anyone_here_invested_in_att_t/h2g2vtv/,0.09,0.782,0.128,0.9799

216,USA," Take a look at $GTHX (G1 Therapeutics)

1. FDA-approved product - Trilaciclib (""Cosela"" is the only FDA-approved therapy that helps proactively deliver multilineage myeloprotection to patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer being treated with chemotherapy)
2. High upside potential by the end of the year according to the respectable analysts (100-200% upside from the current price 21-22$)
3. Professional management with strong worldwide sales plan. Within a short time they made ""Cosela"" available in many regions, including USA, China, Israel. Also ""Cosela"" included in two updated national clinical practice guidelines, that means more sales.
4. They have enough money to avoid any dilution risks at least by the 2023.
5. Collaboration with Pfizer. G1 has a non-exclusive clinical supply agreement with Pfizer to provide palbociclib for its rintodestrant/palbociclib breast cancer trial. The trial was good and maybe some deal is around the corner. If that comes true the holders will see 50-100% market cap growth permanently.
6. ""Cosela"" has an universal myeloprotection mechanism and its approved only for SCLC cases for now. Approving Cosela as a myeloprotection tool against other chemotherapy types will mean tens of billions dollars revenue per year in the 5-7 years.

219,DD," All brokerages run netting operations.  In that respect it doesn't really matter who their upstream market maker is.  The consequence of running a netting operation is that you have to manage risk.  It is becoming apparent that some brokerages are more beholden to their upstreams than others and it is also becoming apparent that manipulating the market, via gamma hedging those brokers running netting operations must do, is an actual thing.  It's just now, instead of hedgies having all the fun, certain *ape* communities have figured out that, collectively, they hold just as much power (if not more) as multi-billion dollar hedge funds.  If the *apes* were truly smart, they would figure out which brokers produce the biggest gamma hedging while also having the largest exposure to shorting hedgies and every last one of those apes would pile into that/those brokers with their gamma squeezing collective action (buying shitloads of stock *and* options is probably the best strategy here).  

It's a balance.  

You have to find the broker who is simultaneously netting on the risky side of the spectrum who also has massive hedgie shorts while not being too beholden to their upstream market maker so that they won't gank-fuck retail apes with ridiculous trade restrictions announced out of the blue when the apes run their collective action campaigns.

233,UK," You can buy hedged etfs to mitigate the risk if you're concerned.  In general, the stock market grows faster than currencies change rate.  Or just invest in UK stocks if you think the pound is going to strengthen considerably in the short term.  

I'd advise that no one knows which way things will go.  The exchange rate was pushing 1.42 for a month and has plunged back to 1.38 in just a couple days on a comment from the Fed.  

A stronger pound will reduce the value of your current investments, but it also gives you more buying power.  If you're a long term investor this isnt a bad deal unless the exchange rate runs away from you for years, which I dont really expect to happen.  Just buy us stocks that you intend to hold long term.",RumHam1,2,/r/stocks/comments/o4d7mr/should_investors_outside_the_us_be_concerned/h2glitx/,0.023,0.912,0.065,0.698
234,PLTR," I just gobble up the risk. I mean, it's hard to buy US stocks elsewhere.

I do admit that sometimes I do base my decision on whether to buy/sell depending on USD/PLN price. Sometimes I'm 5% up, but the USD has fallen and I have no profit. Makes you think long term.

On the other hand, a weak dollar makes me want to invest, because when it's at the lower edges, it's bound to bounce eventually. USD is not PLTR, it wont drop down 80% to climb back up. And if it does, there will be other issues to worry about than my position denominated in USD.",GMNestor,1,/r/stocks/comments/o4d7mr/should_investors_outside_the_us_be_concerned/h2gs7xf/,0.159,0.732,0.109,-0.7252

244,AMC," Okay lots of things here.

First I’m not preparing for a crash, but I am prepared in the sense that I’m diversified into businesses that should do well even in economic turmoil.

No I don’t think we are going to see another 2008 type crash. We might, but I think not is more likely than so.

I’m not sure what you are doing, so I can’t say if it’s good or bad, but when I hear AMC and GME it sounds like a big nope.

No it wouldn’t break the market. There is literally no way that’s possible (as in it’s actually impossible for it to break the market)

People always talk about a crash. There are an equal (or more) number of things that indicates that things can keep going up for a long while still.

253,CLF," You sound like you’re trading and not investing. Nvidia is a great stock in both cases actually and I applaud that move. I made a quick 87% in one day on some Nvidia calls myself just last week. 

Nvidia has had a few banger short term catalysts come out in the last two weeks. Aapl has not. Nvda > aapl for trading lately.

What aapl had that nvda doesn’t lends more toward long term investing; dividend, 99.9% safe, untouchable moat, etc.

If you’re looking for beta for the sake of trading, get out of mega caps altogether. 1% in aapl is actually quite massive at aapl’s market cap  compared to even a 10% one day rip in say CLF.",mikecm11,1,/r/stocks/comments/o3vdiq/is_apple_a_crap_stock_nowadays_arguments_for_and/h2eztcn/,0.0,0.896,0.104,0.91
