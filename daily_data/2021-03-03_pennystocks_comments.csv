31,GSK," Just wanted to add some more information to your last paragraph, you missed a couple of the specifics. I'll try to be concise. 

The most important thing to know is that the market for dialysis patients is about $1 billion and the market for non-dialysis patients is $2-3 billion. So  it's clear which one is the preferred market for any of these drugs. 

Akebia's drug is called vadadustat, their major competitor, FibroGen, has a drug called roxadustat. GSK and Bayer are currently making their own oral formulations to compete in this space. GSK just got their first approval in Japan. FibroGen is partnered with AstraZeneca, so I would have higher expectations about their ability to market the drug. Now, let's get into key differences. 

1. FibroGen's roxadustat is already approved for use in China and Japan. They have also already cleared phase 3 trials in the United States.

2. Akebia's vadadustat has not yet cleared phase 3 trials. They have finished them and are awaiting an annoucement. They met all endpoints on both of dialysis trials but **failed** safety targets on their non-dialysis both of their non-dialysis trials. This is a big deal. This is the bigger market.

3. their primary safety endpoint that they missed was an increased risk of heart problems. The injectable alternatives have been marred by these concerns for years. It's possible that the FDA flat out refuses to approve for non-dialysis patients if this is the case. 

4. to be fair, FibroGen has run into a similar issue recently. They finished their phase 3 trials and then the FDA pushed their date back to March and now has convened an advisory board without setting a date. The assumption is that based on Akebia's data, they are deciding whether FibroGen's non-dialysis data needs to be similarly re-evaluated. 

>
Key takeaways: 

>
1. it's not always about the drug. If, like I suspect, all of these drugs end up being more or less equal, it's hard to see Akebia coming out ahead. For practice purposes, their 3 competitors (Bayer, GSK, AstraZeneca) have a significantly deeper marketing budget. 
2. it may be that none of these drugs get access to the non-dialysis market, in which case they are splitting the smaller $1 billion budget themselves.
3. if I had to hedge my bets, I would still bet on FibroGen. They already have approval in 2 countries, they already passed phase 3. This little hitch in the road honestly could lead to a good buying opportunity down the line. 
4. long-term, there's no arguing that GSK and Bayer will be the clear winners here. They are slightly behind in product development (although not by more than 1-2 years, I'd estimate), but their marketing budget far eclipses anything FibroGen or Akebia could come up with.

196,CEO," I considered passing on FOMO because my own DD didn't lead me anywhere great. Like the guy above said, lots of outdated info still up that doesn't reflect what the newly minted FOMO Corp does. Looked like your run of the mill pump and dump which I'm not necessarily averse to as long as you're on the early end of it. They seem to be making acquisitions left and right but I couldn't find a whole lot of info about said companies...until I was on their website looking at their board. I noticed the name John Kelly, which sounded familiar, and it was because he's from my city (Baton Rouge, LA) and a fellow LSU alum, and founder/CEO of the company EcoLite LED. Long story short, EcoLite is very much a legitimate company who has contracts all around the city and state here, and some in the intranational and overseas. They did the LED fixtures at a few places I frequent including Country Club of Louisiana and the Sportsplex I play pickup games at, just to name a couple. 

Not saying this is gospel DD or that the company is a good long term investment, but they are at the very least in the business of acquiring legitimate businesses and putting them in a better position to expand.

At the very least it has meme potential for the name alone. Made a small position of 5K shares at .019.

NN ARBOR, MI / ACCESSWIRE / March 2, 2021 / The Coretec Group, Inc. , a company developing a portfolio of silicon-based products in energy-focused verticals, including electric vehicle and consumer batteries, solid state lighting (LEDs), and semiconductors today announced that it has entered into a securities purchase agreement with a single institutional investor to purchase in a private placement offering 75,000,000 shares of common stock (or common stock equivalents in lieu thereof) and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 82,500,000 shares of common stock, at a combined purchase price of a $0.08 per share and associated warrant. The warrants have an exercise price of $0.08 per share, will be immediately exercisable and will expire five and one-half years from the issue date.

H.C. Wainwright & Co. is acting as the exclusive placement agent for the offering.

The gross proceeds from the private placement offering are expected to be $6.0 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds primarily to expand and accelerate the development of its CHS technology, as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes. The private placement offering is expected to close on or about March 5, 2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.",WalkswithLlamas,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/lwl3ny/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gpjmng7/,0.032,0.825,0.143,0.9827
