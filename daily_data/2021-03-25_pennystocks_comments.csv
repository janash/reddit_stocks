8,CTXR," The pedigree of the [leadership](https://www.citiuspharma.com/overview-citius-pharmaceuticals/leadership/) is a huge factor. These aren't some charlatans out to pull a fast one on investors. They are building a company using many many decades of combined experience. They see opportunities in the marketplace and work to capitalize on them. 

The insider ownership is 33.9% and none of those insiders sold when the stock popped all the way up to $2.90. They're all wealthy people so they're in this not to make millions, but to make hundreds of millions or billions. What I'm saying is, it's in their best interest to bring profitable products to market and they have the abilities to do so.

On top of that and what others have mentioned here, I like that I could make money by investing in a company whose product could save lives while also saving money for patients/hospitals. win-win-win

20,CTXR," I guess I‚Äôm confused because I don‚Äôt think it can just be ‚Äúmade in-house‚Äù like you‚Äôre proposing? CTXR holds a formulation patent for Mino-Lok until 2036. And given that there is no other FDA approved options for this type of product out there, hospital pharmacies aren‚Äôt just mixing up random concoctions and hoping they work. If phase 3 goes well and Mino-Lok becomes FDA approved, it will be the only approved product of this type on the market and likely will be for years after that. So pharmacies won‚Äôt be able to just mix up the ingredients and give them to patients, because it wouldn‚Äôt be approved by the FDA to do so without regulation. 

The fact that Mino-Lok will be the only product of this type on the market for at least a few years means that yes, hospitals will pay the asking price for it. 7 doses of Mino-Lok would be about $10,500 vs. the cost of replacing the central line at ~$40,000. Not to mention the other associated risks of central line insertion (pneumothorax, uncontrolled bleeding, other infections related to insertion, etc) that the hospital would ALSO have to cover costs for in this scenario... If it gets FDA approval, the choice is a no brainer.",hkkensin,11,/r/pennystocks/comments/mcizf7/people_who_are_bullish_on_ctxr_could_you_explain/gs554ws/,0.055,0.836,0.109,0.9217

22,CTXR," The difference is that this is not just an antibiotic to treat the resulting infection in the patient from CLABSI. It‚Äôs a product designed to dwell inside the central line for 8 hours and penetrate the biofilm that grows on the inner lumen of the line, which is hard to do, and there‚Äôs not a product out there right now that does it. It‚Äôs not an antibiotic to treat the patient, it‚Äôs an anti-microbial to treat the line itself. Since there‚Äôs no other FDA approved product like this out there, there‚Äôs not another ‚Äúcommonly available mixture‚Äù to compare it to. Which is why the company will be able to charge $1500 a dose if it does well in phase 3 and gets FDA approval. Also why a pharmacy won‚Äôt just be able to mix up a solution similar to it, there aren‚Äôt any solutions currently used for this indication. So you can‚Äôt just take some anti-microbial agents and mix them together and hope it has the same effect that the agents in Mino-Lok does. That would be insanely dangerous to the patient to do, which is why you need FDA approval to do things like this. So given that CTXR has the formulary patent, it protects it from being mimicked in hospital pharmacies. 

I agree there needs to be skepticism, but I really think a lot of people don‚Äôt understand what the product truly is and how there is a huge opportunity/demand for it. I have a super small amount of shares in the company, but I‚Äôm more hoping that it‚Äôs successful because I‚Äôm an ICU nurse and I really think this could be a game changer with CLABSI practice.",hkkensin,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/mcizf7/people_who_are_bullish_on_ctxr_could_you_explain/gs58h7d/,0.021,0.809,0.17,0.99

I feel like Nuclear is the only real option for the future. Even with the argument that it's not, I feel, because there is little to actually no production going on, that the market demand for the uranium supply already out there will only go up due to the fact that the reactors currently online now STILL demand fuel regardless. 

Very little supply means prices go up which means guys who have it can start asking more per pound. DNN has a supply they bought for resale even before they have any production in order to help de-risk the assets they already have in place.... that's one of a few reason why I choose them to buy in on.

104,TLC," I don't feel the argument on their content is really an issue. If you look at Netflix' library for instance, most of it is just filler-up pulp, with every now and then a reasonable and rarely a very good movie/series. People don't always want to watch top-notch movies. Simple, entertainable movies have a huge market. (Some people still watch TLC..). 

And sure Netflix may have more ""good content"" (although that is still a matter of taste, there is a big audience for movies like sharknado that may prefer other streaming services over Netflix), but Netflix is pretty much the captain on this ship right now, so I think they do many things better than their competition simply because they already have the audience + resources to do so.

And on a side note: I don't agree that their library consists of bad movies only, but that's a matter of taste I think.

Overall I think a bit more diversity in the streaming services is 1) a good thing and 2) inevitable (at least I hope..), and I personally believe this company has a good chance of taking a rather large part of the cookie.

About the NFT stuff I'm with you in that I don't see the added value right now, however, I don't know much about these sort of technologies and I've been surprised before, so I'm eager to see how things will play out.

110,DD," I finally folded and sold off most of my penny portfolio yesterday. I gave up about 25% of my huge gains this year by getting too deep into pennyland and away from my tried and true methods of finding value opportunities. I still believe in a small handful of penny plays but from now on I'm going to limit myself on penny stocks... at least until next year's OTC hype craze draws me back in again...

SNPW really burned me. It sounded like they had some good things in the works on top of an established line of business that they were growing (outdoor advertising), but I finally did some *real* DD and realized that they don't actually have hardly any substantial employees, they keep buying subsidiaries that turn into dust, and their medrecycler concept isn't just a half baked idea, but it wouldn't make them money even if it got approved. 

OZSC also got me. I made a killing off it on the Jan/Feb OTC explosion, but then I bought the ""dip"" later on thinking it would go back up again. Didn't do real DD to realize that while OZSC is doing some real projects, they aren't in a good position to actually make a lot of profit off of them and there are a lot of questions about dilution and the company pumping it's stock.

Edit: can't forget about CBBT. What an obvious scam. I fell for it because the other side of the supposed deal backed up what the CEO was saying on linkedin and other social media. That will be a lawsuit and I will be part of it. 

In short, I got greedy and lost all my gains from the OTC hype spike. Thankfully I have still made some money this year from the rest of my portfolio.

Buying a mine to try and ensure you have access to gold to back your crypto, seems like a HUGE risk!  Just to pay off the cost to purchase the mine, they have to mine and process more than 17,000 ounces.  Roughly 4 tonnes of earth worked, to produce a single ounce.  68,000 tonnes to produce the gold to simply cover the cost of the mine.
