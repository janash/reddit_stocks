Short - essentially means sell
Long - means buy
Put - the right to sell a stock at a given price 
Call - the right to buy a stock at a given price
So if you are long call on a stock you have the right to buy that stock at a given price, ie if price goes up you win.
If you short a call position you have essentially sold to someone the right to buy the stock (from you), ie price goes up you lose.

3) Tell half your guys that Outcome A will happen, tell the other half it's B for sure.

297,AMC," My guess is because you buy cheap deep OTM calls which have a low probability of profit and are extremely sensitive to IV crush.  


If you buy deep ITM options, you get better leverage on your money and have less exposure. There is obviously less upside if the stock moons (compared to OTM options), but 40 $8 calls expiring in Dec were trading around $7.50 when you bought those shares, which would have cost you \~30k. If AMC drops below $8, you lose all intrinsic value. However your downside is capped at 30k. With the shares, you put up front an additional 30k in capital, get the same sort of profit profile, and if AMC drops below $8, you lose more than 30k.

301,OR," The risk of selling the covered calls is that you have to hold the shares until the date the covered calls expire OR until you choose to buy the calls you wrote back. But what‚Äôs guaranteed about selling covered calls is that you keep the premium from selling the calls no matter what, in this case a lot of fucking money.

304,AMC," This is not solid advice. The buying pressure is too much for a flash crash. Plus he's not trying to give objective information, he is in the gme camp and is one of those people who doesn't want to see AMC succeed because he feels like it's taking money away from him. 

He's stating a flash crash is a fact that will happen for sure. Last week he was posting that there was no way AMC would go up because they can't gather 450 million shares (was when the price was at $12) 

He said his point and people have upvoted the originaln comment, then he wrote three other posts about a flash crash so people downvoted his obvious FUD.",Azguy303,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nl62th/62k_yolo_into_amc_pray_for_me_i_dont_usually_do/gzim5rb/,0.136,0.787,0.077,-0.7003
305,AMC," Alright I'll write up the 4 possible decisions you can make here while AMC is still mooning and we still have 40 minutes left til the bell rings. Every move outside of this list is either ineffective or just not profitable. These options are listed from lowest risk -> highest risk

1) Sell your long calls and your shares and realize your gains. You YOLO'd a shit ton of money and lived to tell the tale, spend some of the gains on yourself to celly and move on to the next play. Recommend keeping $10K for long calls/long puts, $20K in holding VTI or some standard index ETF, the rest in individual shares

2) Sell your long calls and write covered calls on your shares. Contrary to what you would believe from this subreddit, getting a 3x or higher on long calls is rare, and at any time, especially in a highly volatile stock like AMC, you can forfeit all your gains on them with one bad trading day. With writing 15-20% OTM calls, you not only cash in on high IV and collect a nice $10K paycheck, but also leave the potential to profit an extra 15-20% on your shares while only having the obligation to hold them for another 1-3 weeks

3) Hold your long calls and shares, but set a stop loss. With this option you're not capping your potential upside and also you get to sleep with the peace of mind that no matter what, you still come out ahead on this YOLO. The worst case scenario here is that AMC gaps down before the next trading day, triggering your stop loss below the limit you set it at

4) Hold your long calls and shares, no stop loss. You are comfortable putting $80K+ on a roulette table with no insurance. Best of luck here


With keeping the long calls and writing covered calls, I'm not sure if that option is available for my brokerage personally to have both of those positions at the same time, but I'd say it's option 2.5 here. Kind of a half assed strategy that doesn't negate the risk of the long calls while capping your potential upside on the shares",Te5la1,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nl62th/62k_yolo_into_amc_pray_for_me_i_dont_usually_do/gzjubdk/,0.117,0.747,0.136,0.8471

890,TSLA," Good luck. The guy who shorted the housing market in 2008 (Michael Burry) bought $530 Million of puts on Tesla. 

I'm assuming he bought in around February although the 13F filings were released earlier this month. I thought WSB would be bearish on TSLA after that. Haven't been on here much lately though.

UPDATE:

The position Burry opened has a notional value of $530M not a market value. This mean he is controlling 800,100 shares that were valued at around $667/share when the position was either opened or reported (March 31, 2021)

1171,IBM," Except this has existed countless times before in the industry and while various different platforms have niches and enough to survive and continue to be profitable, they do not to grow.

Every time this kind of thing comes up people think it's new and innovative and going to change the industry. This happens because every single other time it's happened it has been a hot thing for 5-7 years followed by a drop out of public awareness and sunsetting into a stable and profitable platform but a stagnant one. The fact you're under the impression roblox is new despite it not being anything unique and new is exactly the point here. Roblox will be the same. 

Roblox for example targets a niche demographic and functions as essentially an interface and platform for people to make their own creations that can be run in instanced ways. No matter how innovative the ""game"" created on the platform, these ""games"" will always be constrained by the limits of the platform. As a result any ""game"" that becomes successful enough and is growing will depart the platform to become its own standalone title, for example unturned. Eventually, just like every other time this has existed, the advancement of technology which cannot easily be implemented into existing infrastructure and the platform becomes its undoing, because people see a ""dated"" engine and compare it to what they think of games as without understanding what they're looking at, which in turn causes a drop in new users. 

Thats the main issue here. Platforms such as Linden Lab's Second Life does and has everything Roblox has, while also doing far far more and has true persistence as an internet of virtual spaces in a true sense rather than instances of creations you load or join. Second Life also has a thriving creator economy and virtual real estate turning over thousands of dollars per day for creators. Second Life on top of this targets all demographics by being a web protocol rather than a platform for content. 

Despite all of this, Second Life remains neutral in its growth and even slightly negative in growth and while profitable sees little to no growth. 

Eventually Roblox will be the same and then something else trying this ""new and innovative"" idea will come along and be praised as the first of its kind, yet again, and the cycle will continue, yet again. This will continue to be the case until the original concept for the metaverse from IBM actually happens and until then platforms like this won't die but they won't be the game changer you think they are. 

So if competitors to Roblox are doing more than roblox and despite this are not seeing growth in value, how is roblox going to be different despite doing less and targeting an even smaller demographic?

I'm not saying these platforms don't gave a place. They absolutely do and they are important to computer science and our connected society. There is a bright future for this kind of technology and a true platform like the metaverse in the futute. But if you're looking at a bull thesis here on these areas while one may come along at some point, it's certainly not going to be roblox.",BunBoxMomo,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nlaau8/roblox_accused_in_suit_of_ripping_off_kids_with/gzhzvyr/,0.03,0.8,0.17,0.9979

Plus, just go look at youtube videos of people testing the FSD beta in suburban and urban areas, especially unprotected left turns where it always wants to wait during a gap and T-bone the next car or pull out directly in front of it...  not to mention the times it misunderstands speed limits or tries to drive where there is no road when it gets confused.

Elon is good at overstating shit and then hoping it plays out, but I think his luck there might be running out...  just look at how the Boring tunnel went from cool carts that zip around your car autonomously to an underwhelming and claustrophobic tunnel with trained taxi drivers.",hi-imBen,15,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nlej56/tesla_announces_transition_to_tesla_vision/gzi9014/,0.075,0.855,0.07,0.2625
1199,FSD," I own a Tesla. He overstates it by saying it only crashes once in every x million miles. This is only true because it kicks you out before it crashes.

1200,FSD," So, that Elon Musk makes some bold predictions on twitter is no news, he has been doing that for years. The name of FSD is also not a good pick. Now some things you are getting false. The vision of the boring company is to make these tunnels cheap and to connect important points in a much faster way. To keep the tunnels cheap they have to be small and they are perfectly sized for Teslas cars. The driver wich is in there will not stay forever. As much as i know the traffic is controlled automatically, so no driver is needed but he is there for the good feeling of the customers. Yes there have been crashes with Teslas, and the last one in Texas is a tragic example. But this one has nothing to do with FSD or Autopilot, the news that there was no one on the drivers seat is not proven. And i am sure Autopilot was not enabled, they just drove very fast and couldnt steer fast enough.
