2,GOOD," ""MedMen grew rapidly in its early years and watched its debt load build substantially in the process""

 ""MedMen has dug itself a deep hole, and drastic measures may be in order.
A regulatory filing in Canada revealed that the company could be up for sale. As recently as March, MedMen‚Äôs management raised concerns in its filings that it may not have the cash to pay its bills.""

""The company has laid off a large chunk of its workforce. It canceled a $682 million strategic acquisition of PharmaCann in October 2019 to focus on retail operations in California and other states. And it has had a revolving door for chief financial officers""
‚ÄúThe previous management team was growth at all cost with very little adherence to the balance sheet or cash flow,‚Äù Penney said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve curbed the losses and plugged the hole on losses going south. Now they are selling noncore assets and finding cheaper and more affordable debt. They are doing the rational things that they should have been doing for a long time.‚Äù
""For its fiscal year that ended June 27, 2020, MedMen reported a loss of $526.5 million on revenue of $157.1 million. In the nine-month period that ended March 27, MedMen reported a combined loss of $111.4 million on revenue of $96.4 million""

Idk if opening 2 stores in the middle of their own failing business is a GOOD idea but med men always has built expensive brick and mortar buildings, making them look fancy and then cutting funding to everything else in upscale areas (these 2 are in boston and san fran). They hired a new exec as recently as 2 weeks ago to turn things around. TO TURN THINGS AROUND HOW MUCH DO U HAVE TO IGNORE. Its all in a 3 day old LA business journal article. Like its not even outdated come on .. 
You guys are buying into a failing company thats about to downsize and believe stock prices will continue to rise. I think honestly if med men expects to be anything they need a 180 segree turn. Interesting company to invest in though. Also 77 million loaned to the company at 17 percent interest that has warrants on shares of the company and will get bought up if they dont pay. Sooo do the math",Klog801,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/otwdwc/medmen_mmnff_most_money_to_be_made_in_the_sector/h6yio1t/,0.069,0.873,0.058,0.2185
3,OPK," I actually bought my first long call last week for OPK ($6 12/17)...they have a PDUFA date in October and the call was reasonably cheap ($10) so decided to take a shot.

6,HEPA," Yeah not sure what was going on 5 years ago but I've seen several pharma stocks that used to be crazy high. Not getting back there.

Of the 2 I prefer HEPA because they have a ton of cash on hand right now.",blindsided789,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/otlv52/best_pennys_to_buy_to_get_your_feet_wet_selling/h6wbnw5/,0.101,0.77,0.13,0.3224
