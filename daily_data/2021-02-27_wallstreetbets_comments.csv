42,GME," Lmao let's see if y'all still like the stock when you're bagholders once again. 


Hate to break it to you but the hedge funds are not panicking. They're probably the ones that sold you the shares at $100 and $160 this time around, laughing their asses off all the way to the bank, bragging about how easy it is to make money of retail investors. 



I'm sure the cult will downvote this because that's what y'all do with shit you don't like hearing, but it needs to be said so maybe someone will get it through their fucking skull. The longer you hold this, the more it's gonna fuck you. The hedge funds are not scared, they just know to watch reddit now to see what sentiment is brewing. We are very tiny fish in a giant pond, fuck it we're basically krill in the ocean. This is not a movement, and bagholding doesn't prove a damn thing other than how right wall street is when they call us dumb money. Stonks go up, stonks go down, you can't explain that but it doesn't matter because smart money (aka institutions, aka no one posting in here) makes money either way. Long term, the house always wins.


Let me be clear: bagholding and doubling down on GME accomplishes NOTHING but enriching the ones you hate. It won't wipe out all (or most, or probably ANY) hedge funds because their whole business isn't tied up in just 1 shitty overpriced meme stock. This won't create a more fair and equitable stock market, if anything it's more likely to lead to increased regulation to protect you idiots from yourselves and further putting us at a disadvantage.

I had been buying and selling the days leading up to the first squeeze. I was just not willing to accept that level of risk for the situation, but when RH blocked buys, I was ready to buy and hold. 

I guess the upside is that I was given a few of very powerful reminders:

1. Be fearful when others are greedy, be greedy when others are fearful. Warren Buffett's signature rule would've helped me here. Wouldn't have made that first FOMO.

2. Don't average down too early.

165,RH," I'm buying. Drive it to the ground because I only have $27 to spend.

I think what actually happened with them was a storm of financial technicalities which had nothing to do with alliegances or scumminess, and was actually the result of the planet of the apes flood.

I think what happened went like this: Word gets out that people are chasing these stocks to get in on a seemingly guaranteed money-multiplier.

Way too many people try to get in ASAP, but complain that their broker is taking too long to clear their deposit and they might miss the only window left.

So they are told that RH will give them instant access to $1000 at least, so you can spend that much at least to get a position of some kind secured.

Nobody thinks of where that money comes from, because we all each(including RH) know that our cash is good and will clear in a day or whatever.

So millions(?) of new accounts are created and immediately run to spend the $1000.

But it does have to come from somewhere, because the stocks should not be bought without money, right?

So maybe RH had a model of just spending it out of their own pocket, because this was never an issue, making all those millions of dollars com straight out of their pocket.

As a broker, I believe they have to keep a certain amount of money on their books, which is dropping if they typically have been just using their own cash to cover the noobs.

So their holdings drop so far that the DTCC has to tell them they need to get cash because they are out of compliance.

RH has faith the checks are good and once they clear, there will be exponentially more money in their system, but will be shut down if they don't get that extra cash. Hence why Vlad said he did not see a liquidity problem. He was sure that 99% of these were good.

So they have to comply, and get the money from Citadel. Then in order to keep more apes from instantly digging this hole deeper, they have to limit buying so that their holdings stay stable.

I thing it went something like that.

So their core business model would still be attractive.

So I would buy. I expect they will keep innovating as well.",Knary_Feathers,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltdxzb/the_house_didnt_let_us_trade_and_now_we_will_burn/goy3vd2/,0.019,0.838,0.143,0.9947

266,FOR," It was so hard to watch my $1k turn into $5k the first go around and not cash out (I took a little WAY too early but held the rest all the way through the pop, hault, and fall) and then watch it turn to ü•ú and stay there for a month. It was even harder watching the $4k I loaded back in go to $23k on Thursday and just not take anything. Not a dime.

This man saw his $100k go to <$50k, trade sideways for months, then turn into over 1M then fluctuate between 7M and 2M and STILL HELD THE FUCK ON. Didn‚Äôt take profits until things became so fucking üçå you‚Äôd have to be crazy not to. And even then he let his shares ride. He doesn‚Äôt have üíéüôå, üíéüçÜ, üíéüé±, he is FUCKING MADE OF üíé. And when the world was saying the squeeze was squozen and that GME would fall back to $10/share, he DOUBLED DOWN at $38.

It wouldnt have been undervalued if some hf had not bet against it in the first place so it is directly related.

Yes he did think it was worth more than its value at that time and believed that a turnaround is possible, and yes Cohen joining in played in for a lot, but if you think Cohen didnt consider the 140% short too , you are probably gullible. 

""That shouldnt detract from his original motivation"" .
No it shouldnt but unless you think its on amzn , msft or aapl level , if it was a purely 100% value play, dont you think he wouldnt have got out in the 3-400 price? Or you think he really did value the company to be worth even more than that?

294,AMC," If you haven‚Äôt experienced this before, there‚Äôs more to it than what the news stories show. I‚Äôve experienced it and can explain for those who have not.

Companies do this for retention. The bonuses at the top will likely come with strings attached that they have to pay it back if they leave before a date.

Think about how crushing it would be for your AMC shares if news broke that the CEO, CFO, COO, etc. all quit. That would indicate lack of confidence in the company. For most people it just looks like top dogs being greedy but really it‚Äôs normally the board of directors (the CEO‚Äôs bosses - yes, the CEO has many bosses) determining that if the CEO, etc leave, it may crush the stock and/or cause a spiral effect where more and more associates leave the company.

The board knows this and so they issue ‚Äúretention‚Äù bonuses to keep those people from leaving.

The way this actually plays out is, you get a legal contract that you sign that says if you leave before ____ date you are responsible for repaying the *entire* bonus within ____ days.

Then your bonus comes. Let‚Äôs say you got a $100k bonus. After taxes and deductions, etc, maybe you see $60k of it roughly in your account. Congrats!

Guess what? If you leave the company, you have to pay back that full $100k - even though only $60k of it hit your bank account.

Many people will ask for their new employer to cover this $100k as a new signing bonus (you guessed it, more strings attached to that too!), but it‚Äôs effective at keeping most people around, assuming the date isn‚Äôt too far out (the employee would rather stay for the year or whatever, then move on and actually get to pocket the signing bonus at the new company rather than paying the ‚Äúfee to leave‚Äù the original company.

311,PS," Guys, that same CEO staved off an AMC bankruptcy. CEOs will ALWAYS get their tendies. If you think he didn't deserve his tendies, then consider this, AMC would've filed for bankruptcy LAST YEAR and there would be no potential AMC squeeze and no tendies for you and me.

Let's stop with the false shock and awe. In the grand scheme, $3.5mil is a small drop compared to the money this man raised to keep AMC afloat. So, enjoy your squeeze, and give a nod to the leadership.

The good news iis when the stock was high amc used it as a swap to pay down there debt which on the long run makes the company better in the long run.  The fact that management did that means they made a smart move that makes the company more lucrative in the long run and hence helps the stock price go up.  GME did not sell any to pay off their debt which in my eyes was not a smart move by management because they would have been better situated as a company if they did.,hdarth,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltp3p1/am_i_the_only_one_upset_about_this/gp2gdvx/,0.083,0.754,0.162,0.9124

431,AMC," [It an SEC filing this morning, AMC said it will be issuing around 44.4 million shares of Class A common stock to Silver Lake and related noteholders in the transaction, which will reduce its debt by $600 million.](https://deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-silver-lake-swaps-debt-for-equity-as-cinema-chains-stock-surged-1234682417/)

I don't know if they are totally debt free now, but AMC just ""paid off"" $600 million in debt. Whether the stock goes to $50 per share or 50 cents...It's not AMC's problem anymore; it's Silverlake's. 

Silverlake is presumably betting that the stock is going to be worth more in the future. Before, as the debt collector, they can only get their $600 million + interest.  

But suppose AMC, now debt free and coming out of a pandemic (with people who want to do anything out of their home), sees a huge surge in ticket sales. Those are now worth multiple billions.

435,AMC," AMC issued more shares at the end of January. 44.4 million is the number I see. 


Point of a squeeze play is that short positions must be closed, they are obligated to. Buying the stock and refusing to sell drives the price up.(classic supply vs demand) By issuing more shares to raise funds and pay off debt, they harm the supply/demand ratio by injecting into the supply side. 


I never invested in AMC because it always looked like a distraction play pushed by people who felt they missed the GME train and wanted to replicate the price spike on a stock with a lower price tag as to gain a better position.

So it's not as the shelf offering came as a surprise to anyone who did any research into the fundamentals prior to investing.

I know it's inconvenient but for this to work some of us apes need to keep our shares in cash accounts not margin. Have two accounts if you need to do so.

Who‚Äôs to say that the hedgies didn‚Äôt push to raise the stonks up to $160-$180 knowing that us retards were watching it maybe not investing in it waiting for the squeeze. So the stonks start going up on Wednesday and everyone gets on board watching it go up to $170. Us apes buy GME up in a frenzy.

***INTERPRETING DAILY FINRA SHORT SALE REPORTS***

Mods please don‚Äôt delete :)
I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts about FINRA daily short sale reports and what it means. Importantly it doesn‚Äôt mean what you think. This isn‚Äôt FUD it‚Äôs just how market making works.

TL;DR a lot of the short volume is market makers shorting to facilitate *buy* orders and they immediately cover with the next trade. 

-High short volume in the FINRA report actually often reflects net BUYING. This is why trying to interpret these reports is pretty much useless. 

-That sounds crazy but that‚Äôs how market making works. 
-FINRA report is only for off exchange trades (dark pools). It‚Äôs a myth that dark pools are all institutional, your retail broker is sending trades to dark pools like Citadel, Virtu, etc. 

-A MM makes money on the spread between buying and selling (obviously). 
What happens is - your order to buy 100 shares of GME at market gets sent to a dark pool. The MM (a computer) SHORTS you those shares at $108.793 and then BUYS those shares back at $108.791. A short of 100 shares is recorded. This also explains how you see ridiculous volumes and ridiculous # of shorts every day for a stock that has a 50M float. The MM isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgoing short‚Äù GME. They short it for a millisecond then buy a fraction of a penny lower a millisecond later.

-So high short volume in the FINRA report (which is ONLY reflecting off exchange trades (dark pools) does NOT necessarily reflect high levels of actual shorting. It often reflects high levels of buying! Um. Like we just saw this week. Repeat that It does also does NOT reflect exchange trades. 

You don‚Äôt have to believe me you can read this super interesting piece here. Generally speaking, the idea that large short volume in the report is good news for holders seems true! It‚Äôs just not for the reasons you think.

581,DD," I don't get how people don't realize this. I guess not everyone has been a GameStop customer for year. Maybe I should do a DD about why I still shop at GameStop and ALWAYS WILL.

Short Reasons

\-My Membership is valuable. I have supposedly saved over $292 in savings since I became a member in 2018. This is only the value of my points redeemed and $5 coupons. Plus I get bonus points for trade-ins, bonus trade value because I'm a member, a magazine every month, special ""pro-day sales"" (just like Prime member only Sales). Meanwhile GameStop clearly tracks my data because they send me emails about new games I might be interested in (and they usually are right, I am interested.) , and they send me trade credit notifications saying ""You could trade in \_THESE\_ games for $X value"" and the games are specifically populated from games I bought from them before. This pulls me back into the store to sell them a game for $10 that I haven't played in 3 months, and then guess what, I buy another game. 

\-I can always trade things in. I've probably traded over $1500 worth of shit here. I often trade my old games and gear, but as a perpetual cheapskate I often will trade gear I bought at a thrift store or pawn shop. Just last week I got $120 trade credit on an Xbox One that I bought the day before for $40 at a pawn shop. 

\-I will NEVER stop buying physical copies of some of my video games. Yes, I'm a modern person who buys digital games to. My PC has a load of Steam, Blizzard App, Epic games I downloaded and bought digitally. I also own probably 200 different video games in physical format because I LIKE IT. (I also own Vinyl Records, and UHD's.) People will always want this. This is why there are still bookstores. Some people will never use an eReader. 

\-I really love the customer service aspect. I do often go into my local GameStop and get the knowledge and feedback of the employee about what new games to buy. Most employees who work at GameStop, LOVE VIDEO GAMES. I can't say this is true about most Big Company stores. The guy working at Best Buy, or Macy's, or Hobby Lobby don't necessarily love their products they sell, it's usually just a job. Sure they may have electronic, clothing, or hobby knowledge, but they aren't usually someone who can talk your ear off about the product they are selling for hours on end, and then when they get home, USE THE PRODUCT THEY SELL, for hours on end. Lol. If corporate GameStop started to realize how amazing the employees can be as an asset they could explode the company from utilizing them. Hell, I don't even think the GameStop employees have some sort of cool name for them other than or ""associate"" or some shit. Apple has their ""Genus's"" why can't GameStop have their ""GameMasters"" or ""L33TH3LP3RS"" (God did I just say L33T, is that so oldschool now or something?). Anyway thanks to the GameMasters I've purchased countless games I never would have. Half the time because I go for one game and buy a second, and half the time because I want to kill time on a free day and go to GameStop to shoot the shit with the employee and buy a game which I never would have bought otherwise. 

\-I can put a video game on my Christmas list and actually receive it from my mother-in-law or grandfather who would NEVER ORDER SOMETHING ONLINE. Not only can they buy it at a GameStop, but they can go into the GameStop and buy it and give the employee my Phone Number or Email and he will add the points to my account, or even give me a digital code linked to my digital locker in my account

Short Reasons

\-My Membership is valuable. I have supposedly saved over $292 in savings since I became a member in 2018. This is only the value of my points redeemed and $5 coupons. Plus I get bonus points for trade-ins, bonus trade value because I'm a member, a magazine every month, special ""pro-day sales"" (just like Prime member only Sales). Meanwhile GameStop clearly tracks my data because they send me emails about new games I might be interested in (and they usually are right, I am interested.) , and they send me trade credit notifications saying ""You could trade in \_THESE\_ games for $X value"" and the games are specifically populated from games I bought from them before. This pulls me back into the store to sell them a game for $10 that I haven't played in 3 months, and then guess what, I buy another game. 

\-I can always trade things in. I've probably traded over $1500 worth of shit here. I often trade my old games and gear, but as a perpetual cheapskate I often will trade gear I bought at a thrift store or pawn shop. Just last week I got $120 trade credit on an Xbox One that I bought the day before for $40 at a pawn shop.

Signed my kid up (6yo) for the pro membership just bc of the monthly coupons & I definitely spend more $ there bc if it. We‚Äôve been to GS at least once a month for the 4 mos since signing up. 
Another great thing about it is you can use the coupon on anything-I have yet to find an exclusion.

585,FREE," GameStop employee here, been with the company for 3 years so far. The membership is really worth it even if you are a digital person. Those $5 coupons works on anything (minus visa gift cards and Amazon) but people always uses them to buy Microsoft points or PSN cards and even eshop money for the switch. 

Another addition to the membership is personalized shopping. That means if you buy action figures then you will get coupons (EXTRA) for action figures. For example, buying 5+ action figures will get you a FREE $22.99 action figures. Another example, buy 10 pops and get a coupon for FREE 2 pops. 

They really improved their membership this past year. I did not like it at all in the beginning but then I found out from working and pitching it to customers that it REALLY WORKS! And people love it! 

Also, don‚Äôt forget you get double the points with the membership which you can use those points to either renew your membership for FREE or get EXTRA coupons that you can use either online or in store. 


Each store/district have a metric system for hitting a percentage of membership renewals or new sign up every week, month, quarter and year. 

If you want to help GameStop stop by, buy something and sign for the membership. And if you want to help even more, do a couple of pre-orders for upcoming games that you are interested in.

597,MTG," My fiance and I go to gamestop pretty frequently, and are friends with the local managers and staff. Last time we were there the manager was telling us about a guy who came in, told them about the tendies he made, and bout a shit ton of stuff. There has also been a lot more foot traffic in their store since people are curious about what's going on.

I honestly think that gamestop has a lot of potential to be a thriving company. I think collectibles are a great start (initially why my fiance and I started to go in, since some collectibles are harder to get online) and I'm lookin forward to seeing what they do in the future.

Personally, I really think that gamestop has the potential to be a hangout space. I used to play a lot of MTG and what made the local game store a lot of money was the fact that there was always tournaments, game nights, d&d, and just plain hangouts. High schoolers would go there and chill. 

Gamestop has the potential to do the same. Get some pokemon tournaments going. Advertise their Pokemon go days and make a store event out of it rather than just a picture with a QR code on it. Smash tournaments, game nights... there's a lot of things they can do to bring people into the store, and people in the store means people are more likely to buy your shit.",thatthempersonthere,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltep3k/i_shopped_at_gamestop_today_and_it_blew_my_mind/gozfvqh/,0.03,0.896,0.075,0.872

601,GME," I realized that GameStop‚Äôs potential trajectory is huge. GameStop has a reputable, known name everywhere with physical locations also everywhere. If they wanted to pursue developing a cloud gaming platform where people could play hardcore shit without having the right hardware, they could. And their network centers could be easily distributed everywhere given that they already have physical locations everywhere. Another direction is internet cafes and PC bangs, which are very popular in Asia, and surprisingly not in western countries (probably because of wypipo mentalities). 

Gaming has been persistent for years and only continues to see growth with proplay and increasing support for gaming culture.

At first I thought it was just a meme, but now I think this GME business is a really good move. Especially with the hiring of new chief officers and such. This is big. Keep getting big guys.

For that, I will hold. Maybe sell if it hits 5000.  For me it's more of an idea than the stock.

I agree with your thoughts on it but I just couldn‚Äôt see it happening to the extent that it actually changes the course of the market.

And the DTCC would be eating the bill on potentially trillions of dollars, while also pressuring brokers to pay.. which of course would trickle down to their customers when they wanted to cash their GME positions in.

I had a guy tell me I‚Äôm a dumbass earlier and then he followed up with ‚Äúthe DTCC has $64 trillion in assets‚Äù

649,GME,"  

Let me explain it to you.... When the market drops, it is a ""risk off environment"", hedge funds liquidate some of their positions BOTH long and short. The unwinding of the two sends the prices of each in opposite directions. They sell their long positions as the overall market goes down, and they buy to cover their short positions - sending GME up in this case. Other than perhaps on a few days when everyone was tuned into GME's price action when Melvin had to unwind, on most days GME does not move the market given it's tiny size relative to everything else.

\---  
There is a relationship between GME and the market, but not the way you hypothesized. The over-shorting of shares has produced a relationship that moves counter to the market when hedge funds reduce their bets during market uncertainties. When they want to cash-out during broader market sell-offs, they buy GME to close out their shorts. The best way to look at this inverse relationship between the broader market and GME is to look at the stock's BETA which is currently near -1.95 (Yahoo Finance shows this)

(A BETA of -1.95 means for every percentage point the market goes up, GME goes down about -1.95 percent. This is based on historic relationships, and are not indicative of the future.)

\---

For anyone interested in learning more about BETA, search for it on Investopedia.

In short BETA is a measure of how a stock moves against the broader market. A BETA of 1 would indicate a given stock moves in lock-step with the stock market.

\---  
TLDR - hedge funds reducing risk by closing out their bets sends GME prices in the opposite direction of the market. The two have generally had an inverse relationship because of large short positions needing to be closed out on ""risk-off"" days when everyone is cashing out their bets.",redditish,28,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lteecj/gme_may_have_the_potential_to_dictate_the_course/goz1pkw/,0.023,0.935,0.043,0.8074
650,GME," So basically we have a decision to make here, is that the gist?

The poor are a bit player in this. You are a *max* of 30% of GME. All of these movements are caused by the rich exploiting your position to profit off of the equally-rich. Both squeezes were initiated by extremely high purchases of calls by whales. If there is a ""redistribution of wealth,"" it won't be between the poor and rich - it will be between the rich and the rich.

Because let's face it, 99% of you are poorer than when you started. By a lot. You don't sell at highs, you buy at highs and then hold. Even when it resurges and you're given an opportunity to exit with your savings intact, you instead *buy more* and are just left holding even more bags.

The first dip could also be a result of FUD causing people to think that GME was evidence of a bubble about to pop. And that hedge funds and MM going bankrupt would tank the market

The second dip could be simply people closing positions across the market (selling shares and closing their short positions), to take out their money as part of risk controls

735,GME," I wouldn't cash anything out to buy GME.

The biggest problem I see here is people FOMOing in and getting bad prices.

Figure out what you are comfortable buying, buy it and hold.

Then take 1/2 position profits at 2.5x cost basis. Then sell the rest whenever it hits your upper end target profit area.

If you are patient, then you can wait until it settles back around the 40 range and buy up some of that stock, enact the above strategy, then wait for it to settle around the 40 range and do it again and again.

That way you are never getting overextended. Overextension is what causes paper portnoy syndrome.

766,VAR," This is wrong. The p-value measures the likelihood of seeing a result at least as extreme as the observed result assuming your null hypothesis given an asymptotic limiting distribution . That you‚Äôre doing this in excel leads me to believe that your distribution is the normal which is false for a few reasons (which also hold for the students-t) namely that your observations are not iid. This causes a few issues beyond invalidating your limiting distribution, it also deflates the standard error of your coefficients because your effective sample size is smaller than your observed sample size which then inflates your p-values. 

The poster is correct that you can find a ton of spurious correlations of securities in the market and you also need to adjust your critical value threshold once you find them because a 5% critical value is way too high. 

You are correct that there is not a test for causation but you can test for granger causality using VAR models.  It‚Äôs not perfect but it does help test whether there is a relationship that flows through your vectorized model. Given the small sample size I expect your working with I‚Äôm not sure that you‚Äôd get much out of it but it‚Äôs there. 

I saw in another post you comment that r measures correlation while p values measure something different. However if you‚Äôre testing correlation the test statistic is solely based on the r squared and sample size (which is affected as I described above). 

This‚Äôll probably get downvotes into oblivion but your statistics on this aren‚Äôt good and it‚Äôs be good to learn to do better stats for yourself regardless.",urdit,62,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lteecj/gme_may_have_the_potential_to_dictate_the_course/goyi8dg/,0.054,0.849,0.097,0.9211
767,GME," I do feel like you just took a statistics class and threw everything you learned into the stock market, completely ignoring the fact that the method you choose decides the result and I wouldn't call these statistical methods the best way to analyze stocks.

Stocks are almost always correlated to one another, we don't need to know whether they're correlated but **why and how** they're correlated. Your correlations also aren't very high/Significant for a field as mathematically/algo based as the stock market 

The tech stocks have been correcting for a good two to three weeks now. There have been plenty of other stocks who had a run during the correction due to good news or whatever

768,GME," Relationships don't have to be causal. There is plenty of room for two variables to be related, or associated with each other, and yet not have one truly cause a change in the other.

There could be a huge range of extra variables that you haven't considered that might be influencing a simultaneous increase in GME pricing and decrease in market performance. You're only testing two variables here.

All your tests of correlation and covariance indicate is that GME and the market changes are related. Which agrees with what OP said. Again, correlation does not equal causation.

I definitely feel like you have a misguided understanding of hypothesis testing. P tests weren't developed to combat the conclusion that causation and correlation are different.

771,GME," Seems to be a lot of cherry picking if data and time here. Seems like a more solid approach would be to look at the money flow. 

When GME rallied the first time the volume coming into GME was much higher over a longer period of time. During the short/gamma squeeze some stocks were impacted but not as much as they were this week. This week had some pretty significant drops in large high volume stocks.

Personally I think the case is some hedges are exiting positions to have capital to short or buy into GME so that raises the price, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean the next thing that raises GME also crashes the markets. It could just be more interest in the stock draws in outside investors. It could be that hedges betting for gamestock balance out hedges betting against and afterward the market is fine because although Melvin went bankrupt the other sides fill in the gaps left by them in the market. This is all just theory and you can‚Äôt really know for sure without analyzing all the buy/sell data and the reasonings behind them.

896,GME," To me GME is $30-50 stock with a huge asterisk. That asterisk is broken down into interesting things unique to GME:

1) Giant Fail to Deliver Numbers
2) Diamond Handed Apes increasing their ownership stakes
3) Continued Hedge Fund Dirty Tricks (Media partners dismissing retail investors, the attempt to drag down DFV, the ridiculous halts that happen anytime the stock makes gains)
4) The unclear relationship between Melvin, Citadel, and Robinhood
5) The lack of media addressing any of these issues in a serious manner
6) The endless protests of doom and the open shadiness around efforts to induce the GME Short problem.

If the shorts have covered, then why hasn't all the insanity subsided? Why did the head of the NASDAQ openly state that the market could be paused so that hedge funds could reposition themselves out of a horrible situation? Why have multiple ""important people"" on CNBC and other news outlets stated that barring intervention GME could have jumped to $1000 or more and the response has been pained looked on peoples faces?

So I am still holding my position in GME as it does not make sense. $100 is small potatoes. The mystery and fear surrounding GME makes me think we have more growth.

897,GME," There is  a lot of difference on the potential benefits depending on your entry point.  Let say, you have 1000$ to invest in GME because you like the stock, you can:

1) Buy 12@80$, sell them at 1000$ -->Profit = 11040$

2) Buy 10@100$, sold them at 1000 -->Profit = 9000$

3) Buy 6@150$, sell them at 1000$ -->Profit = 5100$

  
For me, it is not about the potential profitt, is about hitting as hard as posible to HFs. This has to led to a market reform where markets are fair and not controlled by The Money.

910,CEO," I believe if we can get the stonk up to 200 by mid week and get the $200 options released we could see a rise to 400 by Friday due to them having to short those options.  If we hold we could see this rise but to get to 800  will require a huge whale.  If it gets to 800 the skies the limit.  If Cohen gets announced as CEO this will definitely help.  Otherwise we are waiting for the next Finra and seeing how deep they are in now.  Holding is the key because if they have no stocks to buy then they have to short.  They borrowed 200k shares friday at a cost of 1.8 million, that's like a 10 spot for them but they are paying huge interest also.  Holding and buying at dips increases pressure.  This is a long push but I believe the stock in the end should be valued from 120 to 200 in comparison.  Keep holding my apes and buy at dips.  If we can't get to 800 this week the next opportunity I believe is March 25/26.  Everytime we buy we increase the pressure and they have to short.  Eventually all these interest payments will become too much and they will have to try to get us to sell.  Push Monday/Tuesday and we could be in the homestretch with some help. This is probably our last chance until March 25/26  If not DO NOT SELL we don't want them to get out of their positions and a big push later.  We are the American resistance.

So, right now, I think the stock is a bargain under 10, if they restructure or fail to address their ballooned debt I'll reexamine my feelings on it. I'm not going all in on it, and the money I'm putting in I can let marinate for a while if need be. If the price drops back to 6 or below before summer ends, I'm going to load up some more.

948,GME," Who do you think is going to force hedge funds to cover their shorts? The banks/brokerages where their bros work? Nope. HF guy can call his fraternity brother who works at the bank and ask him to give it some time. The SEC? lol. Guess who works at the SEC - guys who used to work at the same hedge funds that are now massively short GME. FINRA? again, lol. The same agency that invented the most unfair ""consumer protection"" rules ever (day trading restrictions) is suddenly going to start monitoring the system to look out for the little guy?

That's what the $1000+ short squeeze hypothesis doesnt account for - the system isn't fair, hedge funds have serious and powerful connections to make things go their way.

If some bank or agency starts to make the shorts cover, hf bros will just call up their friends and give the ""too big to fail"" argument - ""if gme squeezes to $1000, it'll cause the whole global financial system to collapse"" - we already heard them laying the groundwork for this argument at the congressional hearings. Same reason everything else craters every time gme moons. 

The system isn't fair. Nobody is looking out for you. There will not be a sudden, massive redistribution of wealth because of a gme short squeeze. Nobody in power is going to let that happen. When was the last time someone in power created or enforced a rule that negatively effected them? Look at congressional term limits for an example.

I'm not saying you should sell or that gme isn't worth the current price.

I'm a wagie who's good at being poor. I wasn't exactly keeping my lady's man in finery before all this. Everything I'd spend my money on is closed anyway. Why the fuck would I sell? Do they just not understand a fair few of us have a consistent stream of income? From my perspective, I'm not losing money continuously. 

The longer they put it off, the worse it's going to be for them. I'm hoping it dips again so I can pick up more. TDA already tried to lock my account for bullshit reasons 3 times on Friday. Three hours later, I finally get 6 more shares. Wasn't going to buy before that. Hell, if a certain type of digital ponzi scheme reaches 50,000 I'll just liquidate that again and throw it in.

I'm just saying they can remain solvent for much longer than a week.  Especially at the current GME price.  The lead up to the squeeze will probably see prices steadily rise and remain high.  The hedge funds would realize that no amount of short attacks are going to drop the price back down to low levels.  No amount of naked shorting is going to scare people into selling.  The high price and the high interest is going to be a constant, permanent drain on their capital.

These hedge funds have boards of directors and investors they need to answer to.  Every single financial meeting they are going to have to show  ever-increasing giant red numbers next to GME.  Imagine a having a so-so month but the thing that dragged you into the red overall was the massive amount of GME short interest that you've been telling your investors ""is about to go away"" for four consecutive months and the problem is just getting bigger.  Eventually, someone is going to demand that they quit fucking around losing money and close the positions once and for all.

1116,NOW," I posted the message below yesterday:

I posted a few weeks ago about the unique options data we run.  After today‚Äôs market close, GameSt0nk has a range index of 62.  What this means is MM‚Äôs see more downside than upside.  In the last 5 years, this is the highest range index GameSt0nk has seen and there has been no other instances of this.

The high side target after today is $153.85 but the low side is $32.26.  This is extremely uncomfortable.  I own 92 shares and will continue to hold but you have to be a Diamond handed autist to the Max to buckle through the impending dip we might see soon again.

TL;DR Might have to hold through another nose dive again before we trend back up according to MM‚Äôs.

NOW, after today‚Äôs close, we not only have a Range Index of 51, but a HIGHER high side target of $168.96.  You want more good news you say?  Okay fine.  We‚Äôve seen GameStop in this position 41 times in the last 5 years.  In an average of 15 market days, it made its high side target

40 out of 41 times.  Let me repeat that.  We have 98% odds of seeing $168.96 in 15 days or sooner with 98% certainty.

Given how GME isn't going away in the average joe's mind, I'll be buying with conviction at even $50-$70. I don't care if I have to wait till 2025 for the value to fully realize. If the turn around happens, even boomer fundamentals won't be able to price the stock less than $170 at current dilution. Those claiming that the stock is only worth $20 are working with stale, faulty assumptions, as if bankruptcy is a likely enough outcome at this juncture. Physical disks and hardware are still here.

And *that* my friend is in fact *all* you need to know, because silver has in reality been scarce as fuck! All the mining companies report it, demand is at an all time high because of its many many uses. Look up how many actual uses there are for this precious metal.

You are taking opportunity risk though, for example if you own GME and sell a contract at 105% the current bid and it squeezes, you will only gain 5% plus whatever your premium you collect is (Premium is displayed by the share so a contract that displays on RH or another broker for .50 for example would be a premium total of 50$ since each contract is for 100 shares) and would lose out on the rocket

CCs are a great tool for stocks you want to hold for a long-duration and are willing to eat unrealized losses on if it does have a bad period, in fact, if you continually reinvest and do good DD and research, dips in your selected stock can be used to bring down the cost basis while still selling at your selected strike price. Also if the price drops significantly you can buy back your calls at a lower price and then hold the stock if you think it will return to your target price, in theory a volatile stock that dips 30% (COUGH GME COUGH but forreal don't CC on GME unless you are okay with the volatility) in a day and returns to the TP could be used to make quick cash off CC, of course that is extremely risky

But, if its a decent bit over where you bought at and its not some crazy life long holding like AAPL at $5 or something; why not just take the money off the table if shares get called away?

One tip is to play further out. The longer until the contract expires, the more extrinsic value there is; also, you can then roll it out/up/down if you need to.

When only a few days are left to expiration, prices can move in a way where rolling becomes difficult or makes less sense.

It is way more complex than that.   


A fund might have had a short position on the stock originally, like Melvin, from say $4 a share. Obviously this short position, as of last week at $40, was really under water, but they could have covered then at a 10x loss.   


Meanwhile they could have taken OTHER positions, like they could have went short at $450 as it crashed to $40... a 10x gain.   


Or they could have went long as it went from $40 - $180 (as it did last week) to hedge their short.

1317,GME," Note:  I am still learning, constantly, and I am a complete newbie.

From my research, watching vids, reading news - they can get out of the shorts, through ITM call options.

The investment firms that are short, just buy in the money call options, and exercise the option.  That puts the onus on the MM via the CBO in chicago  to provide said stock.   They get their stock at ITM pricing, and close their short positions, if they double, then they get long stock, to sell to those needed it, like other MM that need stock to settle their call options. (I first saw this idea from Uncle Bruce youtube)

And rinse, repeat, and so on.

Monday is gonna be a really interesting day, now that the market closed above 100 on Friday, but only barely - I don't think enough that $100 calls will be optioned due to cost per unit to buy the call option in the first place, which carries with the contract.

The stock is still shorted, just not as much as January. the MM need stock every Friday and more-so on Mondays if they don't have enough..  The HF are selling, buying, shorting, naked shorting, buying ETF, borrowing from ETF to get GME stock to sell, short, buy, and so on. ( I read about this here, and in some other web articles, about borrowing ETF, using GME stock contained therein, then reassembling and returning later, with interest).

Edit:  To add, all this means, its all deferral.  They defer actual ownership and transfer of the stock until later, or to another entity, passing the buck back and further until finally, someone has to pay for it.  That some one is the retail investor in the end, that actually puts in real cash to own stock paid cash, or someones taking a loss at a HF or MM, and swallowing that loss on their balance sheet for the day or week.",Disposable_Canadian,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltpnrj/why_melvin_and_the_other_hfs_basically_have_no/gp1tqyj/,0.032,0.956,0.012,-0.7617

Given the MASSIVE volume trading GME on Thursday and Friday, my guess is they‚Äôre holding on to dear life hoping that more of their tactics like short ladder attacks will force panic sellers on Monday as they try and drive the price down. 

I think they underestimated the diamond hands of the retail traders wanting to send a message. The sub is twice as large as it was during the squeeze in Jan. 

And now even more people are informed on how they manipulate the market and aren‚Äôt as fearful anymore.

Guaranteed the HF will have a nice little pile of stock which they gleaned from ETF, buying cheap calls previously, etc, ready to sell to the MM at a profit.

Monday and Tuesday market is going to be interesting to say the least.  Could skyrocket, likely will just be volitile and bounce like a yoyo all day.

The high position of proper (not naked) shorted HF, which I think I read is around 40% short interest (source but end of January date: [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) ) , will play a part on Monday/Tuesday.  It looks like the short volume ratio on Friday alone was 24%.  ([https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)) Marketwatch shows GME at 30.22% float shorted.

1346,MSFT," My point is their attention is else, and they feel safe. And that's always a bad place to be. Yes they have a digital download capability that hasn't seen any innovation since the Xbox 360. And it doesn't matter how much capitol you have if you put it all somewhere else, and they are much more focused on other things. Very expensive things that they cant afford to fall behind on. Just because you think they can doesn't mean they will. If fact they are not. They are content with the market share they already have in this sector so sure that so long as the have the XBOX they cant really lose.

Believe it or not Microsoft is not as dangerous as you think, mostly they have been able to hold it together because of the Window operating system being the default OS for the developed world, and brand recognition. When was the last time Microsoft did anything to grab your attention. The Zune, how about Bing, or the self driving car that years behind Google, and Tesla. When was the last time you had a positive user experience with a Microsoft product, and didn't just use a Microsoft product to get to a better version of the same thing. (looking at you Bing)   
Microsoft is a perfect example of mediocrity in a monopoly. Microsoft is big but its also bloated, slow to react and missing any and all inspiration and innovation. Honestly the longer we talk the more I think long term shorting MSFT might be a good play.

Please tell me anything good about them other than  ""but the Xbox..."" and ""you cant beat the establishment""  I mean think about what sub you're in while shouting how you cant beat an established organization. bullshit.

1368,AMC," In short, it doesn't.

Without a strong upward pressure on the stock, options expiring in the money only help take stock out of circulation if they are exercised, otherwise MMs who delta hedged will sell it back into the market and thus lower the price or maybe save it for the next gamma squeeze.  MMs already covered the $8 options buying below $8 as it increased during the gamma squeeze on Wednesday.

What it does do is prevent puts from expiring in the money, which puts downward pressure on the stock, and some traders will still exercise the option just to prevent the MM from selling the shares and dropping the price.  This is a slow build, the fact that a large option of calls expired ITM means HFs shorting the stock expired OTM and we're worthless.  That means less capital to cover shorts and buy more options that drive the price down.  

There isn't an end date on this, don't invest any money you need anytime soon.  I have a position in AMC but it isn't as large as the biggest target in my opinion which ended above 100.  Impatient people will lost money and patient people will reap the rewards. If the stock drops and everyone tells you this is over, that is when I would buy because this is all far from over.

- MM deliver whatever stock they have on hand maybe just 100,000.
- hedge fund receives this 1st 100,000 stock and sells it on after hours trading (shorting the price)
- MM then buys this 100,000 stock and delivers it once again to hedge fund. 
- the hedge fund then repeats by selling the stock (shorted) and MM buys up again.

Repeat this for 4 hours in after hours trading and assuming it takes 4 hours to repeat the above step of buying and delivering, wouldn‚Äôt the contract then be considered delivered since the MM had over the course of 4 hours delivered 1 million stock?

1461,GME," This company needs to produce real results. All of this is just speculation.   


I think $40 was a great price for the company, and DFV knows that. Now at $100+ it's in over-valued territory again. They have a lot of work to do, a lot to prove, and so if you are trying to determine the fundamental value then it is not yet $100.   


The price is where it is because of MANY other factors, mostly supply and demand, a short float, aggressive short positions, aggressive long positions. Lots of money being made. This thing could just as easily go back to $500 for a day before crashing again.   


At this point if you bought at $40 this is an investment. Sit back and check back in a year.

  
If you are a TRADER then you can buy at any price and make money, if you're lucky. If you buy at $100 and sell at $150. Amazing 50% return. But, most people are going to be greedy, hold on too long, not have any stop-losses and watch their 10 minute gain of 1000% become 20% become -25%. This is because most people, new retail investors, don't have the experience yet to realize the price movements of GME are not typical, not normal and people trade an entire year just to get 18% on their money, and consider that good.

1483,AMC," IDK if your question was serious or not, but I'm going to answer anyway - and sound really stupid doing so because I'm just someone who doesn't play video games, never has, & I think the closest I've ever come to walking into one of these stores was dropping my son off at midnight to stand in line to get the newest Halo game. (As a book editor I'm ashamed of that run-on sentence).

So, according to the article, buying options is the **wrong** thing. I see a lot of people buying options when according to the article, they should be buying **shares** & holding so they can vote. The article says once you're a shareholder, write to the board, but it doesn't say about what (strategy ideas maybe?). 

The article also mentions that the customers of Gamestop are mostly the older crowd. So I'd assume that they would want to appeal to the younger crowd now. Or how would they change their model to make more of the older crowd walk into their store, or ship from their locations to the homes?

1484,GME," IDK if your question was serious or not, but I'm going to answer anyway - and sound really stupid doing so because I'm just someone who doesn't play video games, never has, & I think the closest I've ever come to walking into one of these stores was dropping my son off at midnight to stand in line to get the newest Halo game. (As a book editor I'm ashamed of that run-on sentence).

So, according to the article, buying options is the **wrong** thing. I see a lot of people buying options when according to the article, they should be buying **shares** & holding so they can vote. The article says once you're a shareholder, write to the board, but it doesn't say about what (strategy ideas maybe?). 

The article also mentions that the customers of Gamestop are mostly the older crowd. So I'd assume that they would want to appeal to the younger crowd now. Or how would they change their model to make more of the older crowd walk into their store, or ship from their locations to the homes? Hell, he made Chewy an online retailer, so why can't he do that with Gamestop? Why can't they be the #1 online retailer of games & partner with Microsoft?

1499,GME," They aren't running out of anything without buying pressure to fill FTDs. These guys have billions to play with and they are making money buying dips and selling options too. They are slowly covering because of limited supply. Once inflation heats up bond yields will shrink the market and suddenly their money pool will become less plentiful. That's when the squeeze will squozen in my retarded opinion.

Synthetic shares are infinite as long as the price points land perfectly. That's why price should be ignored because it's being manipulated to get tens of millions in calls and shorts. Also notice only losses are being advertised and not gains by the media. Why did they ""bail out"" Melvin?

1500,GME," Your mention of loaning crazy DTI ratios in 2008 paralells the nearly 10 fold increase we've seen in GME shorting fees over the past week. It would seem that if your borrowing costs rose 10 fold you'd move to other investments... but we are seeing nearly the opposite. 

My other scattered thoughts are below, curious to know what you think. 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In my opinion we do not currently have accurate short interest numbers, and perhaps never did considering all the potential ways to disguise it. As soon as hedgies knew we relied on that number, it ceased to become a reliable metric. 

We all saw Melvin Capital lie about closing their positions pre-squeeze, we all saw CNBC try to divert us with SLV, and we all heard the IB president said if more of those calls were exercised on the 27th/28th it would've crashed everything. We didn't see short fees this high back then, nor did we see no available shares to short like we did on the 25th.

If this blows up we all know the effects it could have on the greater system, and for this reason hedgies are doubling down. In their mind they win both ways, either profiting off shorts by manipulating us all to sell, or getting bailed out by the govt if it all blows up.

Looking at upcoming option contracts: every single expiry has more puts than calls (OI). 

Of all the call options with 1000 OI or above, 4 out of 16 are currently ITM.

Of all the put options with 1000 OI or above, every single one is OTM, with the greatest OI in $20/$30/$40/$50 strikes respectively.

&#x200B;

Let me remind you that these expire NEXT WEEK. There are clear plans laid out here to profit MASSIVELY from a decrease in gme price, and erase the gains from currently ITM options.

1552,RKT," That's pretty far otm, so it's a long shot. Think of that more like a lottery ticket and you'll feel better about it! 

My best guess is that we'll see positive price movement until dividend, then it will flatten out until another catalyst, which probably won't happen until next ER. I'm a RKT fan, but I'd be surprised if your call will print. I'd probably sell the call prior to the ex-dividend date, and hopefully take some profit due to the run up. Unless you are just truly looking for a lotto ticket, or find the price seeming more probable. Good luck!

1556,RKT," Simplest explanation my smooth brain can manage is a call option gives you the ""opportunity to buy 100 shares at a set strike price per share, but not the obligation"" the advantage here is you aren't required to say buy stock you called a strike price of $30 in even if the actual stonk price is $20. If that happens at expiration no one will buy your call contract and it becomes worthless.

In short you aren't on the hook for $30 x 100 shares because a call is a contract not the shares themselves. You can sell the contract itself or if you let it expire it becomes worthless and becomes $0.

Another example: In RKT I assume the price will break $30 in 2-3 weeks, so I bought 1 call option at $0.38 per share (so x100 that is $38 I paid) set to expire 3/19. Once the price of shares increases to $45, people now want this contract because it garuntees them the opportunity to buy 100x shares at the strike price of $30, which is under the new high price. 

This starts to seem complicated I know, but put simply... If the price is at $45 and I have a contract that says ""you have the opportunity to buy 100x shares at $30"" that means someone could buy it and ""exercise the option"" meaning they decide to buy those 100x shares. Since they now own 100 shares at a price of $30 when the actual stock price is $45 they can now sell for a hefty profit. This evaluation is how call options increase in value as the stock price goes above your set strike price. In my actual case that means the call I bought which cost $38 is worth about $500-900ish.

That was only the upside tho. The downside is the closer you are to the set expiration date the less optimistic the market becomes of your contract being capable of making a profit if someone bought it from you. For this reason the longer you hold it the less valuable it becomes. Considering looking up some videos on what 'The Greeks' of call options mean. Hope this helps",Siceless,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lt8r61/the_post_earnings_rkt_play_rocket_to_the_moon/gp218f1/,0.048,0.776,0.176,0.9939

The market doesn‚Äôt care about your feelings. It doesn‚Äôt care about how much you hope or need a stock to go up. It will chew you up and spit you out if that‚Äôs how you play it.

1649,NEW," I think that's the floor and in large part that's the reason we may have seen the buying we did last week. POSSIBLY those that were still holding short positions down (who made a big profit) realized it wasn't going below $40 and with DFV's re-buy, CFO out, earnings coming, many decided to close.  
That created a huge surge of buying and as there was more buying other shorts saw their chance to get out.   


I think most of the shorts that shorted from $450-$40 are out now, but there are NEW shorts that entered as it went back up from $40-$180.   


Those shorts at $180 probably didn't cover at $100... So this is like a game of rinse and repeat. Every surge is an opportunity to open a new short position because... well... the stock shouldn't be THAT HIGH... but when you hit rock bottom the shorts covering creates it's own new momentum.

1675,IMO," In my opinion we do not currently have accurate short interest numbers, and perhaps never did considering all the potential ways to disguise it. 

&#x200B;

You're simultaneously saying big institutions have closed, but if they didn't they won't now? We all saw melvin capital lie about closing positions, we all saw CNBC try to divert us with SLV, the IB president said if more of those calls were exercised on the 27th/28th it would've crashed everything. We didn't see short fees this high back then, nor did we see no available shares to short like we did on the 25th. 

&#x200B;

They should sell pc components, pc accessories and most importantly a pc game platform that rivals Steam. The fantastic thing about a GameStop platform is that the program itself could make recommendations for computer upgrades to improve performance that could be purchased through them. What scares me away from GameStop now is that they are latched to the titties of Xbox and PlayStation. Both of them are steering towards 100% digital content that can only be purchased from the Xbox store or PSN.

1693,EA," Im personally not into Gamestop. They've been cunts to gamers the whole time I was growing up. Overpriced and never gave a fair price for traded in games. I don't see Gamestop competing with already established digital giants like Steam, Microsoft (which will hit release parity between Xbox and PC with the launch of Halo 6 I believe) EA, GOG, Playstation Now etc etc. The market for physical sales is dropping and why would you want any peripherals or hardware from Gamestop specificially when you can get it on Ebay/Amazon or any other online retailer? Plus when games launch on other online retailers you often get same-day delivery at not extra cost. When you pre-order on Amazon you get a pre-order price guarantee. I've saved money on Luigi's Mansion 3 and Hyrule Warriors because the price went up post-preorder and Amazon covered me. Will Gamestop offer that?

I guess if I ever want an overpriced Mario t-shirt or tacky Gears of War wallet I can always rely on Gamestop's physical stores to have those in stock...

The employees were sometimes quirky but often just running off a script and management was the worst. Often times rude and obnoxious from my experiences.

The only other option is turning the physical stores into e-sports centres and every qualified opinion in esports has been saying it's a bubble for a looongggg time. It's usually just a straight up loss to get involved in e-sports unless you're Valve or Riot. Again I don't see Gamestop being able to turn that around or run it at a loss for too long before they go under. 

Turning the stores into E-sports/Tabletop gaming centres? In Europe at least the stores aren't big enough for that so maybe in America? But it's such a what if and it ignores the ""e-sports is a bubble"" argument to make it work.

I just don't see a scenario where Gamestop is a viable brand in 1-2 years, nevermind a brand that goes from 100 dollars a share to 1000 dollars a share.

1715,GME," >I wouldn't put too much faith in the power of Gamestop as a brand. They're probably more well known for something to do with the stock market and 'reddit' than anything else.

thats very short term thinking for a decades old brand that is probably more known as a mall fixture than anything.

this is a moment in time.  gamestops been around long enough to be in the public consciousness.  

>And yeah it's specualtion sure, but why not specualte on all the things they can do that can make them a successful brand/company rather than say 'who knows'?

the point of ""who knows"" is more, assuming we understand the breadth of options as armchair traders is arrogant.  im not saying that Cohen is going to make the right moves, but he has WAY more information than any of us do.  the point is, it doesnt really matter if WE can conceptualize how they fix it, because it all boils down to, ""do you believe in Cohen, or not?"".  its always been a bet on the person.  and whether he's successful or not, we're not going to suss out his strats just from a couple days of thinking about it.  


>I've mentioned multiple ways I don't think they'll be big and nobody seems to be able to do the opposite apart from 'Ryan Cohen has all the answers!'

its also a lot easier to envision ways any of this will fail, so its more about getting to the heart of what you're really betting on.  it's not gamestop, per se.

they don't need to give you a 1 to 1 counterargument, because they're betting on something else entirely.  trusting ryan cohen isnt the inverse of ""here's all the ways gamestop has issues"".  the whole point of trusting ryan cohen is the idea that he can look at a situation that seems lost and make it work in ways we don't understand.  Chewy makes no fucking sense.  that's the point of this bet from that side.  Gamestop DOESNT make sense right now.  that's never been the argument.  ""Ryan Cohen has the answers"" isnt a bet on gamestop, its a bet on Cohen, and that's exactly why that explanation is actually all they need to tell you in counter argument.  you either believe in him or not.

>I think Ryan Cohen jumped onboard because he wanted to turn a <$20 company into a ~$50 company or higher. That's it. He was gonna do that by turning a physical retailer into an online retailer. That's it.

and that's a fair opinion.  this could be it.  but that's a different argument than ""gamestop can't get bigger"".  that's an argument that you think Cohen had different goals than other people do, and that you think he's not as good as other people think.  that's a a valid counter argument to the people you're against, and fundamentally different than ""gamestop has issues that they can't fix to get bigger"".

>I think Gamestop has been completely overblown as a long term business especially when people start talking about it in the >$100 mark or especially anywhere near the $1000 dollar mark which is completely bonkers.

i mean, it has comapritively few shares on the market, 100 isnt ridiculous long term, its not trading billions of shares.  

the 1000 dollar mark has nothing to do witht he company though anyways so not sure how that's relevant.  that's about the squeeze, and not the company.

>By the time Gamestop turns into an online retailer with any reputation, subscription based gaming services like Xbox Game Pass and Playstation now will be the norm.

that's an assumption, and an assumption that gamestop can't provide a better service.  we don't know either of those things yet.  you're making your bet, others are making theirs.

>Nobody can seem to come up with any positive specualtion that I haven't already given decent views against earlier

they did, they just made an argument that ryan cohen himself is the positive speculation and you're not willing to accept that as a valid argument.

>Gamestop in 2 years will be worth more than Tesla in its peak because otherwise that makes my decision to hold onto a stock I paid $400 for 3 weeks ago a bad idea and that just isn't acceptable.

1.  this is a straw man, because you're inserting hypothetical scenarios of when someone bought GME stock to make your argument look better.
2. youre comparing share prices when not all shares are created equal.  for one, tesla has nearly triple the amount of shares in existence than GME has.  so it's not a 1 to 1 comparison.  they can be valued the same share for share and GME still wouldn't come close to Tesla's ""worth"".

if they had an equal number of shares you could make this argument, but they don't.  tesla being worth 1000 a share is a way bigger deal than GME being worth 1000 a share, because that's nearly three times the money invested into Tesla in that scenario.",Sir-xer21,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lt8n05/simply_put_gme_is_actually_extremely_undervalued/goxa9qe/,0.039,0.831,0.13,0.9973

1736,GME," Listen, margin is great in a runup but this is a totally reasonable strategy from Fidelity's end. There is nothing nefarious during volatile periods of requiring more cash to protect a business.  It is all risk management so they arent stuck covering peoples gambling.  To the OP, I know you get that with these types of risky plays.

Some honesty on this board is okay people.  

1) Not all hedge funds are short GME so maybe it would help to take a deep breath and realize some of these firms we generally dislike are on on the same side of your trade, as other large institutions might be with previous disclosures.  Knowing that, does that make WSB less of the good guys?  No...but its about making money, not collapsing the system.

2) Margin trading is risky.  Anyone can get margin called.  It happens to hedge funds and traders all the time.  If you want to borrow someone else's money to trade, take some personal responsibility for the leverage that is in the system.

3)  Yes, markets are rigged.  But the impact on everyday 9-5 citizens has become greater because of leverage.  For those acting like GME evangelists wanting to fight the good fight, see point 1 and 2 as you are playing the same game as hedge funds with your pumping up of leverage and risk to the markets.

4)  I hope you all make money and no one is a bag holder.  This screenshot is brutal, especially if liquidation occurs on stocks you want to hold.  Im glad you had your margin requirements.  And, I trully mean that.  However if even a single person who has gone full tilt on this can xome back to earth without crashing his rocket ship, this forum would be more helpful; with more good ideas to make money.

Finally, more margin calls are coming.  Reduce leverage.",cbdscienceguy,40,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltuu37/3m_lossgot_a_call_yesterday_to_say_that_a_margin/gp2fafp/,0.087,0.745,0.168,0.9814

1796,GME," Why are folks still harping about short squeeze? It's not short squeeze anymore it's gamma squeeze. 

Listen to IB CEO Peterffy explaining why he needed to shut down trading of GME. I'll try to explain it for you. 

Calls options especially lotto types far exceeded the outstanding amount and no one is selling the options. Say you have 50mil of total float. Due to gamma squeeze, the amount of crazy lotto call options that are now in the money spiked to 150mil. This means the brokers that sold you the options needed to buy 150mil shares to deliver to ü¶çü¶çü¶ç. But when the total float available (not even counting shorts) is only 50mil, where else are they going to buy the remaining 100mil from? The only reasonable answer is from short sellers. But shorts are already peeing their pants. Who else is willing to short? Hence the price will shoot up stratospherically in order for short sellers to take on the risk to short 100mil more shares.

Go google Peterffy GME. He explained everything in the YouTube video.

That $1 payout is all a matter of how low you get in and how long you plan to play most definitely.

If you‚Äôve not heard of the [Piggly Wiggly short squeeze](http://www.markmancapital.net/blog/2021/1/26/piggly-wiggly-short-squeeze-in-1923) consider the following:

One man took out loans to acquire 160,000 of the 200,000 outstanding shares in order to cut off shorts from covering. **NYSE governors simply paused trading for 5 days** so the shorts could exit their positions.

Also Robinhood isn‚Äôt a hedge fund. Simply use a brokerage like fidelity or vanguard that is a full service broker dealer and had higher capital requirements than brokerages like robinhood. I‚Äôm pretty sure fidelity never shut down trading.

1944,DD," TLDR; Institutions are vested in a blowup on this too.  Retail might not get screwed by Wall Street because some of Wall Street is long.  

One thing to keep in mind is its not just retail driving this, at all.  

Retail could be hedged against getting the complete screws because plenty of institutions are on the long side.  They didn‚Äôt see it coming necessarily, but by their nature they had relatively huge holdings and its a relatively small stock issue.  Someone, somewhere in there org ‚Äúliked the stock‚Äù and they bought what for them was a relatively insignificant amount until January and the squeeze. 

Many have so little in and have internal analysts that see the internal payoff and a low but real likelihood that this pops.  Some cashed out but some are holding too.  They have far better DD and statistical models than what retail investors are messing around with.  They are working with assigned probabilities of a rocket ship to the moon that probably say they can only lose a limited amount but have a real chance they could make a mint on a squeeze.  

Its likely become an opportunity to ride this thing out with massive upside and relatively no downside because a long position the size or greater than that of DFV started at less than 1% of their working capital if they bought under 20.  The ability to outperform the rest of their portfolio with a strong resistance line at 43 has a huge potential Expected Value calculation.

A lot of the buying that kept it pinned around 100 had to be those guys leveraging the Diamond Hands of the retailers to maintain massive pressure.  A bunch of largely tapped out fully in retail investors couldn‚Äôt keep driving this up against the short pressure to take it under the 100 option mark late Friday when it sat bouncing for 30 minutes between 100 and 105.  Hell, it literally flatlined at 100 for seconds at a time on the live display.  That‚Äôs massive opposing trade volume between institutional algorithms/buying.
