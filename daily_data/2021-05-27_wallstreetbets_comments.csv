Like take AMC right now. MASSIVE price spike. If you think that'll pull back you could buy OTM puts and sell them back after they gain value even if they're never near the strike assuming they beat out the decay.   


Big advantage to OP rolling up is that he was able to have multiple exits and could have taken money out as long as the stock went up any appreciable rate.

During the first short squeeze at the end of January, large swaths of retail were disallowed from buying GME which ultimately alleviated the squeeze. There is zero reason to suspect this wouldn’t happen again. If hedge funds, the DTC and brokerages really are staring at potential insolvency and financial collapse, there’s nothing they won’t do to prevent it. Likewise with the SEC itself. They will not let a single stock bring down the global economy - they’ll halt trading in it long before that happens. So what if they have to go testify in front of Congress again - they’ll still be in business and people will move on. Retail simply does not have a way to counter this. Retail is playing a game where if by some stroke of luck they caught lightning in a bottle twice, hedge funds, brokerages and the SEC would change the rules again before the squeeze approached anything resembling $1,000,000 a share.

I still think the amc ceo is a pos who is trying to bring his buddies on the board so they can get a payout as well. If his buddy isn’t elected to the board I bet the stock jumps in 2022.

1058,IMO," There aren't ""grounded people"".  At least not vocally, some people are definitely saying they're bullish but they're swing trading or making a killing on CC's.  The bet is that enough people believe in the 10M to keep buying their shares for higher and higher.  Once that stops... it stalls or goes down.  It can't go up infinitely without new blood.

IMO the evidence points towards the squeeze potential going down significantly although there is still some naked shorting going on clearly with the FTDs.

 My reply:



Some will not.  But IMO it is not realistic to make every single short in all of GME to cover.  I also don't share your opinion of the magnitude of naked shorting going on.  It would require an endless stream of new investors buying at higher and higher.

In any case, my bet has some squeeze potential baked into, hence 3 weeks after shareholder meeting (I might also consider rolling out the bet further in expiration for bigger gains which is another potential cushion).  I guess if it goes to $10M for an entire month, stays there, and the entire world descends into chaos I might lose my bet.",actuarythrowaway445,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nm7ja9/yesterday_made_50k_gme_bet_300340_call_spread/gzncqbp/,0.094,0.885,0.021,-0.8751

1083,SNDL," I have no idea whether SNDL is a good stock or not or whether there will be a squeeze or where the stock ends up...

BUT, get your fact right.

The company has current assets, less current liabilities of about 900M in Canadian Dollars, which is about $738M USD.

They had at 2/11/2021 1,561,352,718 shares outstanding so at a share price of $0.8815 the market cap is $1.376B USD.

So you are paying a $640M premium over book value for this company. If the company can make money that might be fine.

Even before lockdown as a company they were approaching bankruptcy, the reason the stock is doing well is simply down to the short squeeze which was predicted here months ago.

The other thing people fail to realize is that during COVID,  because of all the closings they started airing movies on streaming sites and they are continuing to do that alongside theatre releases. Why pay $13-15 for a single ticket and buy overpriced snacks when for $100 a year you can stream all the movies you want and invite all the people you want?

It’s a sector theme. I like to generally pick up best of breed, unless there is a special opportunity, so it’s important to look at financials, projections and management, as they’re extremely useful for determining the quality of a business.
