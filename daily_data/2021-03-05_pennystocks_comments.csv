2,DD," As an outsider, I think part of the problem is people want quick returns on pennystocks, which invariably only lines up with large volume and P&Ds. Much of the promoted companies have terrible fundamentals or no basis for future profitability, which amplifies the volatility further.

Personally I only use pennies for higher volume long term plays on companies I feel have strong futures, not some OTC pink that’s trending on Twitter despite having no cash inflow or impending product/service.

Also, as someone in pharma — every pharma play adds an extra layer of risk, and most of the promoted companies Ive seen here will miss.

7,IMO," The market has been plunging since last Tuesday, and people have been trying to buy the dip day after day because they think that’s what they’re supposed to do because of quotes like these, as though Warren Buffett would ever encourage the behavior of penny stocks. What’s happening right now is real and serious. Margin debt is at an all time high which steepens selloffs, and there will be a lot of retail investors that don’t recover from what happened this month for a long time. This isn’t just your run of the mill bloody Tuesday, and people need to realize that and really think hard about their decisions. Stocks with no revenues, that are not even pink current, that are still up huge over the past year even being down a lot now, should be treated with caution IMO. How many people in this sub have bought a stock without ever knowing what the company even does? People need to understand in this sub more than any other to exercise caution, and not all penny stocks are even remotely the same.

11,EDIT," OK, let me switch my tone back and just answer this question:

Buffett turned 16 in an economy where housing was basically free, the monthly cost of living could be covered by 30 hours of work, and there were less than 1% as many securities on the market as there are now. His lifetime has overlapped almost perfectly with the greatest economic expansion in human history, and he invested nearly all of his money into the very economy that led the expansion.


Literally no one on Earth is in that situation now. Buffett's wealth came from a set of circumstances that fundamentally cannot be reproduced, and has basically zero chance of ever happening again, unless humanity burns it all down and starts over from zero with a new economy. The story of Buffett's billions is a fascinating biography, but it is not relevant advice in the year 2021.

24,DD," Big anxiety girl here!  PTSD, other disorders..  what I've learned is that you have to have a plan.  With the PTSD- if I'm going freaking nutty- I have a plan to recognize what's going on and distract.  If you need to shut it off and walk away, do it.  But here's what I do to keep the anxiety at a minimum. 

With the stocks.  I fear the tax man!  When I buy- it is generally with the intention of holding 1 year or more.  I always watch the open and often the close.  I watch the open and if it looks like a freaking bloodbath, I have trained myself to walk away.  If it is looking like it will be a good day, I check it more often.  I've been around for a while and have always had at least one penny going at a time.  

Pennies are rough.  They will be down forever and then spike way up.  And possibly right back down, lower.  You need to have a plan and if it comes to it, an exit strategy.   For me- hold for a year and let it ride or trade profits for greener pastures.  Fun story though- I bought ABML 4 years ago and held on.  

I know better and yet jumped on a few pennies with all the hype early this year and will be taking some losses tomorrow to buy into something else.  Maybe more ABML- to AVERAGE UP.  Cathie tweeted about genomic research...  that's a possibly in the correction too..  I've got my eye on a few micro caps on the nasdaq.  

I won't be jumping into any pennies that have spiked on hype because then you are chasing.  The trick is to do your DD, dip a toe with a small position, and if it warrants it, pile in and hold.  Hopefully you catch a spike that continues.  I try to buy ""real companies.""  I won't buy anything on a major exchange close to not meeting listing requirements.   OTC is your friend but pennies and more importantly-sub penny stocks are dangerous unless the plan is to trade.  (Words I do not always live by- I've held to worthless more than once.) 

I prefer to take my losses at the end of the year...   but what the hell.  Losses will be a nice surprise next year at tax time?  I'll be taking about an $800 hit tomorrow but will be buying something else on a nice dip.  

Cheers.  Trust your plan.  Hopefully you can find a balance.",it_swims,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/lxw5au/need_to_step_away_for_my_mental_health/gprbi09/,0.084,0.83,0.086,0.2225

99,AVA," Robotic Assistance Devices Announces Dealer Agreement with St. Moritz Security Services
Henderson, Nevada, March 5, 2021 — Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions, Inc., (OTCPK:AITX), today announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary Robotic Assistance Devices (RAD) has entered into an agreement with St. Moritz Security Services, Inc., one of the ten largest security firms in North America. Through this agreement, St. Moritz broadens its offering to include all of RAD’s autonomous remote security solutions.

“We are thrilled to now be able to offer RAD’s remarkable security solutions to our clients,” said Matthew Schwartz, CEO at St. Moritz. “End-users are looking for cost-effective and innovative alternatives to traditional manned-guarding, and the solutions that RAD offers fit perfectly into our business model,” Schwartz concluded.

St. Moritz achieved over $100 million in annual revenue in 2019 which ranks them as one of the largest American-owned security companies in the U.S. and in the top 2% of all security companies worldwide. St. Moritz has thirty offices nationwide, and covers the entire U.S. and Canada. Their sales pipeline with RAD is already active with up to fifty units, a mix of RAD ROSA and AVA units, expected to close soon. These devices will be deployed at the distribution centers for a nationwide furniture retailer. Additional details will be disclosed in a future announcement.

“It’s a great honor to welcome St. Moritz to the RAD dealer channel,” said Steve Reinharz, President and CEO of RAD. “Their impressive client base and their commitment to delivering  excellent service aligns very well with our objectives. We anticipate great opportunities in supporting St. Moritz as we roll out RAD solutions to their end-users.”

Specifics of the agreement were not disclosed, but the company confirmed that the agreement covers all RAD security devices, mobile and stationary, including the popular ROSA and AVA units. These two solutions are experiencing an acceleration in market acceptance due to their low-cost and high-performance in expanding a facility’s security operations.

Robotic Assistance Devices (RAD) is a high-tech start-up that delivers robotics and artificial intelligence-based solutions that empower organizations to gain new insight, solve complex security challenges, and fuel new business ideas at reduced costs. RAD developed its advanced security robot technology from the ground up including circuit board design, and base code development. This allows RAD to have complete control over all of design elements, performance, quality and the user’s experience of all security robots whether SCOT™, ROSA™, Wally™, Wally HSO™, AVA™, or ROAMEO™.

208,TV," I've only been investing for about a year, so no, but you can see the history of stocks by just looking at charts.

On another note, most people preaching doom and gloom for the foreseeable future are either shorting the market right now or went cash so they WANT the market to keep falling in the same way that I want it to recover. This applies to people on Reddit, Twitter, TV, etc. so you really can't trust anyone. Some people want a panicked market to make money. I'll just stick with what I've been doing and if I lose, I lose. lol

There are tons of people spreading fear and bullshit on the internet about FPVD... but some of these people are clearly so stupid and misinformed that I tune it out. There are going to be some bumps here as FPVD reorganizes its share structure as it becomes BIGToken. I don't really think the share price is the top priority for the company right now. I'm not going to claim to understand how the 150 billion share thing fits into the plan, but I am betting that it is a temporary measure to transfer equity through this reverse merger. 

Just like you, I was up HUGE a few weeks ago, but I only blame myself for not taking profits at that time.

323,AM," Hertz $HTZGQ had a fire sale the last couple days. I picked up 500 @ .63 yesterday (missed the low mark around .40) and it’s up to .89 so far today. Should be around 1.75 IMHO short term and IF it recovers by summer get back to the $4 mark. New plan for a re-org with some financial backing is in play but travel needs to open back up for that I would think. 
American Manganese $AMYZF also had a fire sale, I picked up another 500 @ 1.01 this AM. It’s bounced back to 1.17 as I write this. I like this one long term, it was up to just shy of the $3 mark a couple weeks ago and has a patented process for recycling batts which is truly needed and in play with all the EV hype.
