80,BB," So this is a genuine question, I'm still trying to wrap my head around a lot of this stuff.  
I know what a covered call is, I understand the contracts etc.  


But I go to the options chain on Fidelity and the highest I see for BB for next week is 15.5.

I realize that I can put essentially any value I want in there, presumably it being too high meaning that nobody will actually buy it.  


I guess my question is this: does the highest value I see in the present option chain mean anything in a practical sense.

Put differently, relative to what you posted, would selling a covered call (I have 400@15ish) at 17 be likely to be taken?

Is volume the number of calls sold at a given strike price?

I'm thinking it has to be because looking at the values, it's definitely a more or less normal distribution.

Specifically, on the BB option chain I see that

Strike price 1 has a volume of 6

Strike price of 10 has a volume of 1100

Strike price of 14 has a volume of 40k

Strike price of 20 is back down to 4500

Back then an ounce of gold was $20, for 10 gold coins you got a car, 100 gold coins got you a fine house. Gold will still do that today, but at $1900. So $2000 from back then would've turned from 100 gold coins or a house to a single gold coin.

It's even worse if we use 1970 and $35 per ounce as a comparison to today. You lost 99% of purchasing power to today, not just 6 dollars turning into one...

**JUNE 17, 2021**  10:00-10:45 a.m.

**THE TIME FOR NATURAL GAS IS NOW**

Heavy duty trucks total 5% of all vehicles on our roadways, but they account for 42% of all smog-forming transportation related greenhouse gases. Are ultra-low emission natural gas trucks a possible solution to this?

This presentation by **Chad Lindholm of Clean Energy Fuels** will delve into the technology, provide an overview of fueling with natural gas, and the many environmental and economic advantages this alternative fuel can provide.

* $700,000,000 in cash, no debt
* No threat of stock dilutions or market offerings
* Insider's can't sell stock unless stock is >$30 for 90 days
* Citadel owns 5x more AMC stock than CLOV, they take positions in stocks they short as a hedge or secret final weapon.
* Machine Learning AI Assistant for doctors and works with Medicare (growth market)
* Victim of hit piece from shorting hedge fund FUD Hindenburg (same people who slandered DKNG falsely in laughable reports), DOJ investigation from months ago hasn't gone anywhere
* Let's be real, high org ownership is actually kind of good for this squeeze, they're far more diamond handed than day traders or brand new apes.
* Last run up was from $10 to almost $30 - only 5% of shorts covered! For a 3x return we only had 5% cover. Imagine if we forced them all to cover. They've only seen a FRACTION of our POWER.

1078,WISH," Trying to offer a bit of a counter just to help other apes who might be considering WISH.

What differs WISH from etsy/amazon/ebay/craigslist/shopify/magento/etc?
Going through their interface it looks to be all China imports.
Cannot click sellers name/company to find details. Good thing about amazon/ebay/etsy is you can see info on the seller.
Good thing about etsy is you can specifically filter by ""made locally"".
Price changes when you start looking at items (eg. pick a t-shirt, change it's color and the price changes - never seen that on Amazon - only w/ size change).
Differentiator cannot be interface alone.
Log in required to easily browse items (you can click the tiny tab at the bottom to get to ""categories"" - a roundabout method). High friction.

Granted if they blow enough on marketing, the sheer volume of marketing will force many sellers to concede and create a WISH presence. Much the same way companies were ""forced"" to create a presence on Google's old ""Google Plus"" (lots of FOMO). But if that's the case and they don't have fundamentals (NOT only equity fundamentals, but also ECOMMERCE fundamentals), they will burn hot and short.

1079,WISH," Yup. 

eBay I see as a dying platform. Seller fees are too high, they've ditched PayPal and increased their own bottom line. Facebook marketplace is far better for anything local. eBay haven't done anything new in over a decade. 

Amazon is just too damn big. It's going to face anti-competitive issues in future, and it may not be able to buy it's way out of them in the EU. I'd still buy shares, but you aren't going to get significant gains over the next 5 years. Maybe 2X if you're lucky. Market cap is fucking massive and growth will be difficult in a global economic downturn. 

I've already cancelled my Amazon prime membership, due to cutbacks in my salary as a result of covid. As the western middle-class become more frugal, Amazon will be dropped. I'm no longer prepared to pay a price premium, and a monthly subscription, for convenience. 

This all really puts a company like WISH in a very good position.

* Pretty much every single institution has their avg. share prices around $8.50 or more. NNDM is currently trading under $7.50 - Those bag holders are going no where before 5x profits.

I shop there and have received excellent things from them.

The key to shopping on WISH is user feedback with photos.

Don’t buy anything without this unless you want to gamble.

Sometimes sellers will post a photo much better than what they are actually selling.

If this happens, you only have to send wish a photo of what you received and tell them you were ripped off. They refund your original purchase method.

I always take time to review my purchases for this reason, and hope others will do the same.

1257,WISH," After fellow WISH apes shared about Gamma Squeeze, I was curious and look up on the definition:

>The gamma squeeze happens when the underlying stock's price begins to go up very quickly within a short period of time. As more money flows into call options from investors, that forces more buying activity which can lead to higher stock prices.

Which based on the Open Interest of 18th June Options:

[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/WISH/options/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/WISH/options/)

What about WISH as a company itself?

>WISH Business model is inverting Amazon’s strategy, whereby most of their products are unbranded, sold by various small businesses directly to consumers.- The #1 shopping app in 42 different countries- The #1 downloaded shopping app in the U.S. in 2017- Valued at about $8.5 billion with more than $1 billion in revenue in 2017

What about the buyout rumors?

>Remember Amazon in 2015 had offered $10 billion in cash for Wish — and Wish walked.  
>  
>Everyone we've spoken with agrees. Alibaba and Amazon have had acquisition talks with Wish in the past year.  
>  
>One person close to top players at Wish says Amazon recently offered $10 billion in cash to buy the company, and Wish's CEO walked away.  
>  
>Another person who's friendly with top Wish people said they'd heard the $10 billion rumor as well, but that number may actually reflect a new valuation Wish is raising at, not an acquisition offer.

TLDR;If $12.50 Calls printed on 18th June 2021.

It will probably gamma squeeze those naked calls and shorts.

If execution isn't there then the company may go nowhere. All the money from the original rally and this current short is where the funds made their money. None of these funds will risk going long if there is no execution but ready to cover their short at the bottom and buy up at NAV or below NAV to play long later when execution is being met.

1304,CLF," The global market for STEEL is in one of the most ludicrous situations of any commodity (SEMIs are the closest comparison).  

Basically… two years ago China produced roughly 50% of the global supply of steel.  Now, China is fighting their own industry to reduce pollution (steel production is a massive contributor to their carbon emissions and the lack of sunlight in Beijing).  Remember… the Beijing Olympics are going on in 2022 and they want to have a good showing for Beijing including blue skies.  

We literally went from the Chinese government giving rebates to steel producers to push them to export (to keep production high and as many steelworkers employed) to demanding production cuts, removing rebates, and now talking about export TAXES in an attempt to keep steel inside China for their own consumption.  You can see it any of the HRC futures charts (hot rolled coil… the standard for futures pricing for steel) how the Chinese price is now moving in different directions from the US/EU prices.

Basically… two years ago China produced roughly 50% of the global supply of steel.

Remember… the Beijing Olympics are going on in 2022 and they want to have a good showing for Beijing including blue skies.  

We literally went from the Chinese government giving rebates to steel producers to push them to export (to keep production high and as many steelworkers employed) to demanding production cuts, removing rebates, and now talking about export TAXES in an attempt to keep steel inside China for their own consumption.  You can see it any of the HRC futures charts (hot rolled coil… the standard for futures pricing for steel) how the Chinese price is now moving in different directions from the US/EU prices.

1374,USA," Inflation will be transitory and prices will be crushed when the economy reopens and this artificial commodity squeeze goes away as factories return to full occupancy/capacity.

I hear it from contractors/builders and consultants repeatedly in the last month, that material prices are expected to drop by the end of the year. The reason why wood/metal/commodities are up so much is simply due to COVID. Factories have not been allowed to operate at more than 30% occupancy or some stupid % like that, so there's no real supply constraint. As COVID goes away and they are allowed to reopen fully the material prices will crash.

Also, China is releasing it's reserves, and it damn well has to. They cannot sustain their exports if raw material prices keep going up, so they need (and have the power) to squash inflationary pressures and they will do so.

Oil is going up because that's the damn cycle..whatever, it will settle again in a few months. 

What's going on is a bullwhip effect. Supply dried out due to COVId and the market picked up before suppliers had a chance to open up, so they are trying to catch up. This always results in suppliers overproducing and flooding the market as quickly as possible to take advantage of the high prices. The result is oversupply and prices dropping just as demand cools off, knocking things out twice.

With inflation staying low the FED cannot raise rates because it will kill off the economy, and that's why they haven't raised them all these years. The risk for USA is stagnation or deflation. Those two are hard to beat. Inflation can be controlled.

Even if you assume CPI numbers are crooked, and that they might be manipulating weightings, you can look at the individual, unweighted numbers and see that there isn't much worth worrying about. Worth noting that inflation averaged 1.8% over the past 10 years, so technically, they have some leeway to push past the 2% number and still be fine.

Is it that the producers are accumulating unsold RNG inventory because the infrastructure can't fully handle demand?
3. What % of that 0.4B is ""produced"" by CLNE? I understand that CLNE is just getting back into the upstream side, but how far behind are they from its major competitors? Who are the biggest RNG producers and what is their total production capacity?
4. Who are the major players for the downstream side? Is Chevron planning to just  replace their underground diesel tanks at all their service stations with LNG (instead of using pipelines like RNG)? Oh, what are the benefits/disadvantages of RNG over LNG? Do you think LNG would be a threat to CLNE, and if so, what do you think they have up their sleeve to ensure survival and success?
5. That last question made me question whether RNG is the smarter solution than LNG (liquid natural gas) because an infrastructure for liquid fuel is already in place. Tell me how stupid I am, that there's a huge gap in my understanding.

About your questions:

1. Trucking industry choices by 2030 will be diversified. It is wise for any tech not to target a 90% market share. This is impossible. It is more likely that we see various solutions all together. At the moment, CNG & LNG trucks have a 10% market share in China and 4% market share in Europe. In the USA the % stays at less than 2%, so the US will catch up dramatically. Which is the cap? I would say 15-20% market share, which will be more than enough to make CLNE infrastructure very profitable. In this regards, you can look at [Westport investors presentations](https://s26.q4cdn.com/361830528/files/doc_presentations/2021/06/MarketingMaterialsV1.pdf), where Volvo Trucks and Cummins forecasts are outlined (slide 12); both the companies see a 8-15% market share in the years to come. Or you can look at the [BNEF report](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/trucks-haul-zero-emissions-technology-into-commercial-vehicle-arena-59488098) , where they state that just one in five Heavy Trucks will be electric by 2040, with natural gas playing an important role.
2. Not all the RNG will be used in transport, a part of it will be injected into pipelines, while another will be used as biogas (the not refined version) for power generation. Be careful those billions of RNG gallons represent a POTENTIAL supply, not the existing one today.
3. At the moment $CLNE does not produce any RNG, they are setting up the JVs now. On the upstream side, British Petroleum is by far the largest producer thanks to the facilities bought from CLNE.
4. Major competitors on the downstream side are private companies [https://www.loves.com/](https://www.loves.com/)  ; [https://americannaturalgas.com/](https://americannaturalgas.com/)  and other smaller ones. All these companies, included CLNE, mostly sell Compressed NAtural Gas. LNG is not yet popular in the USA as it is in Europe and China but there will some growth in coastal areas. RNG can be either CNG or LNG. CLNE sells a small portion of LNG in its stations
5. Liquefied RNG in Europe is called BIO-LNG. There is not much difference between the two concepts. But LNG stations are more expensive to build.

1433,ICE," I would disagree... 

BMS systems, cooling systems for the batteries, electronic components , suspension etc

Better then ICE absolutely, but do you recall iPhone and Droid phones having updates that squashed their battery life?   

Congress has it wrong really and what the market can make and has in offer doesn't fit what congress wants, it just isn't ready yet and throwing money at it will be a disaster

Really the best bet would be 100 mile range batteries made from Lith iron Batts and an onboard generator that can simultaneously charge the batteries for longer routes.  The efficiencies are huge improvements as the engine runs at peak efficiency all the time when running.  Lith iron batteries last 10x as long as Tesla's but have 60% of the storage capacity.  However they can be charged and discharge at the same time without thermal runaway.  Really the hybrids would be the best bet.  Almost all driving commutes are under 100 miles a day, and if you need to go further... No issue.  Can't find a charger just yet... No issue

But we aren't there yet infastructure, battery or manufacturer yet

This is the local overpass in Kansas compared to the Mt Everest of the real squeezes. 

If a squeeze is your only play, holy shit you’re dumb as shit. Nobody gives a shit about workhorse because it’s a shitty company, which means that retail won’t control the entire float, and without anybody to control the float, you don’t get a squeeze.

1507,IMO," They will be scared as long as there's a reason to be scared.

The Fed all but announced inflation today. Ternium's primary currency exposure is to those appreciating relative to the dollar - that's once concern assuaged.

Institutional investors clearly weren't scared of them in Q4 2020 or Q1 2021, so that begs the question ""whats changed?""

IMO, what changed was Mexico's news cycle and the social climate in the leadup to the election. That, and most everything got pummeled so far this week.

It can take awhile for the sentiment surrounding bloody elections to subside, but what's going to catapult them is when the steel industry finally divorces from other commodities - If Q2 earnings season doesn't do that, I can't imagine what would.

A Threshold Security is defined by Rule 203(c)(6) of the SEC's Regulation SHO as any equity security of an issuer that is registered under Section 12, or that is required to file reports pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act where for five consecutive settlement days: (1) there are aggregate fails to deliver at a registered clearing agency of 10,000 shares or more per security; (2) the level of fails is equal to at least one-half of one percent of the issuer's total shares outstanding; and (3) the security is included on a list published by a self regulatory organization.  
  
Reg SHO is designed to fulfill several objectives, including: (a) the establishment of uniform locate and delivery requirements in order to address problems associated with failures to deliver, and (b) the creation of uniform marking requirements for sales of all equity securities.

I know you guys don't give half a fuck to fundamentals, but most of its appreciation in the last quarter came from BRL gaining ground over USD, it has little to do with the company.

1636,PLTR," This has been said about every fast growing software company ever.  

Many analysts use wizardry to arrive at a price target of $500, or 1trillion market cap.

Keep in mind, My pricing is based on the belief they took those 17 years to develop the commercial offering while being funded by reliable govt contracts.

If that isn’t the case, then my entire thesis is fatally flawed and you would be correct.

However, there are indicators that I am right.  For example Thiels extreme consistency over time on long term strategic planning to establish a moat.  Zero to one is awesome, highly recommend reading.

They took the company public for a reason; it was ready for mass adoption finally.

This argument has of course been made against all growth companies, and sometimes it bears fruit.

All depends on the underlying thesis and vision, and here, I believe I am right.

1764,RKT," Spot on. You could have a totally arbitrary number of middlemen, necessary or not, and they'd still bitch if a single one of them was threatened. If for whatever nonsensical reason the mortgage industry had broker #1, selling to broker #2, selling to broker #3, selling to broker #4, selling to consumer, and someone tried to cut out broker #4, they would still throw a shitfit about the lost jobs. Doesn't matter whether it improves efficiency, any industry that is threatened, no matter how outdated, will always go out kicking and screaming.

You already saw this happen to small farmers. You saw it happen to some brick and mortar retailers, and you'll see the trend continuing. You will see this happen to factory workers being replaced by robots. And you'll see it happen to the mortgage industry. In every case, overall economic wellbeing is improved after the restructuring takes place (though governments can do a lot to help improve the efficiency of the transition... Or not, as usual). That's just creative destruction at work.

People might look back a year from now and if rocket isn't ""winning"" they'll use it to claim rocket is a losing strategy (in an effort to get people to dump the stock so they can buy cheap). Because in 5, 10, 20 years, RKT and anyone else smart enough to get in on the action will be at the top, period, and they know it.

It’s a copy cat F150 and the only value in Lordstown was their ability to get to market fast. They’re going to fail doing that, Ford will beat them to the punch and Lordstown will end.

Morgan Stanley analyst Thomas Allen wrote in a note, **“‘Unregulated’ market exposure is a common theme for [international] online gaming / sports betting companies.”**

“Allen also said that in April 2016, the **New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement issued a policy letter that drew a clear line between gray market exposure—permissible for operators—and illegal market exposure.** SBTech, the analyst said, operates in gray markets. DraftKings is based in Boston, but New Jersey’s stance appeared to set a precedent for how other regulators might handle the issue.”

2157,TSLA," Jerome Guillen explained that Elon Musk would push them outside their comfort zone and they accomplished things that way. Without a visionary leader like Elon Musk, one has to wonder whether a guy like Guillen will be as creative or accomplish as much. If you listen to Straubel and Everhard who founded TSLA they say much the same. They both like Tesla and a are investors in it and are rooting for its success still. While they were there their experience with Elon was him pushing you beyond your comfort zone. Elon sees things others don't and  pushes and takes risks to get there that others will not.

Basically, all these guys are great, but without an Elon Musk driving them to achieve great things they will not accomplish the same. This is no different than working at Apple was under Steve Jobs.

The CEO has a unique vision for an auto company, always under promises and over delivers and maintains level headed communication with shareholders constantly. Idk what more you could ask from a company. 

HOWEVER

The valuation is certainly high for where they are. If you cant handle volatility mixed with long periods of static movement in a stock then i wouldnt get more involved. It is my most successful and fun investment to date...that being said i bought at 4 all the way up to 30 so . Yeah. Ive done very well so far

I would say the real risk now is continued performance and the race to profitability, along with the fact that MARKET wide correction can still take place across tech. They are ALL trading high multiples. But the risk of them going bankrupt is gone, they are state backed, and currently expanding to Europe.

2248,USA," Honestly the best play to capitalize on USA legalizations is the newly merged $MAPS. Weedmaps is the leader of weed e-commerce and doesn't even touch the plant. They provide stores with tools and regulatory guidance needed to succeed, and they bring in hella customers with the app. 

They also advertise on Pornhub. That's bullish.",Gamester677,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o24wyf/tlry_connecticut_just_moved_toward_legalizing/h251b7u/,0.0,0.796,0.204,0.9153
2249,TLRY," Read my comments. I'm certainly not saying Connecticut legalization news DIRECTLY relates to TLRY, but it has industry wide implications.

It's the same as if Florida made a ruling about vegetarian/vegan alternative patties being able to label their product as a hamburger in fast food settings. This isn't news about Beyond Meat but it definitely has implications.",aspiringplebeian,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o24wyf/tlry_connecticut_just_moved_toward_legalizing/h24o5ez/,0.0,0.91,0.09,0.6428

2252,TLRY," >See March to May of this year. What a goddamn slow, prolonged beat down.

That was speculation surrounding the merger with APHA... Neither stock should have ever gotten that high as the merger had a fixed value that placed TLRY in the mid-high 20s - it has since been downgraded... If you were buying Tilray at 50, 60+ - or anything over the mid 20s for that matter - you're a fucking imbecile.",iiteBud,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o24wyf/tlry_connecticut_just_moved_toward_legalizing/h24sfnx/,0.09,0.862,0.048,-0.624
2253,TLRY," Add something to the discussion or at least read the previous comments. Tilray has better acquisitions, mostly that came along with APHA than any other seller of marijuana on the market. I'm fully aware that TLRY is Canadian, but Connecticut is in the UNITED STATES. 

That's the key here. I'm not lookimg for a push this week. The United States sets the stage, whether early or late to the party. Any state introducing legalization news is MAJOR news to the world market and the eventual end of prohibition. Even in the 20's when the US was way behind the curve with alcohol it wasn't until the US legalized that the international exchange/distribution of alcohol really took off. 

I'm honestly a little dumbfounded how these comments can't deal with nuance in anyway. International markets move long term on trends, not direct transactions or individual pieces of legalization. Maybe I'm in the wrong forum with a touchy name....",aspiringplebeian,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o24wyf/tlry_connecticut_just_moved_toward_legalizing/h24ucda/,0.042,0.853,0.105,0.8977

2260,AMC,"  not going up in value, in the middle of a housing boom is what i consider a crash for a lending company

i was in since last nov @ 20.15   .. so i think thats before wsb hoopla.. not sure..dead as in .. lockdowns over , economy opening wide open, housing mrkts rolling,  and crickets out of rkt..  the pump was supposedly not a pump but more of a level up to a norm on an undervalued stock.. aparently it wasnt that over valued after all.  i saw potiential for rkt last summer. thinking when the shit-demic is over maybe it will take off, hind sight is 20/20, shoulda sold during the hoopla,,   at this point in time.. its dead to me.. i dont see any reason it would go much higher than $20-$30.. do you???      so yeah,, 7 months holding a stock and all it saw was a little spike for a few days because of wsb... its dead...to me anyway,,,  one would think an expected up ramp off the tail of the pandemic,,but naw,, its struggling to hold on to $20

and love your assumptions.. you make me laugh.. not everyone invests in wsb popular stocks. i do have AMC, didnt need a bunch of apes to put 2 and 2 together that people will start going back to the movies when the lockdowns are over,, thats a no brainer. however when i bought amc , i had no idea it was shorted into obvilion, i didnt even research anything, that i just bought because it seemed like easy money and it was only $4 /share, so i threw some money at it.",familydroid02,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o1u3lt/rkt_going_to_take_the_house/h24apdm/,0.075,0.858,0.067,-0.3504
