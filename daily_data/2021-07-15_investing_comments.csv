) without ESG factor that is 0.2%, and is quite a bit larger, for example. This seems to track the same index (MSCI World Index), but without the ESG exclusions, and it's 0.1% cheaper, and has far larger AUM- it's the second largest fund in Europe. But this Swedbank one looks pretty fine if you are OK with it.

I'd consider adding a portion of emerging markets. I wouldn't personally get wound up about avoiding China, apart from the fact that many Western funds can and will hold many non-VIE Chinese stocks that you can't hold as an individual, no-one is saying go all in on China. But holding it in market proportion (which would be around 3.2% of a global portfolio) is not nuts. I mean even if it all went to zero (and it won't), that would still only be 3.2% of your portfolio if you are holding China at market weight. It may actually perform *better*. One way or the other though- if you are only holding 3%, why this laser-focus on avoiding it. I'd just include it along with everything else, that's diversification.

[iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets IMI UCITS ETF](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BKM4GZ66) is all emerging markets and costs only 0.18%. It's roughly a third China and two thirds the rest of EM (including Taiwan and Korea that are not in your current fund)- so literally everywhere else that isn't developed, apart from those, India, Brazil, South Africa, Russia, etc. If you put 10% of your overall holding into this, you'd have a bit of EM to capture that possible upside and you'd still only be at 3.3% China. I wouldn't personally sweat that.

2,MSCI," There is no correct answer here because the future is unknowable, so it's entirely up to your preference. However, I tend to agree that if you're going the ETF route, you may as well be more globally diversified.

Personally, my ETF portfolio holds about 50% MSCI World, 40% Emerging Markets (I've overweighted Taiwan and Korea and underweighted China) and 10% MSCI Europe Small Cap. The idea behind the EU small cap ETF is that a) small caps are very prevelant in Europe since we have a lot less huge companies than the US, b) they are excluded from the MSCI World and c) if you want a market-neutral portfolio, you'd have to have about 13% in small caps.",vampire_stopwatch,3,/r/investing/comments/okokvj/usa_vs_europe_vs_asia_not_china_fund_allocation/h59rqbk/,0.038,0.897,0.065,0.3197
3,BR," Projections are hard to nail, but there are enough analysts/researchers/podcasters/talkingheads/advisors/c-suiters inside each organization that they got all sides and bases covered on any particular topic.

Goldman Sachs are some of the smartest, wofliest, sharpest, and scummiest guys on WS. They called out the BRICS. C panned out regardless of their equities performed. I is on the right track. BR spiraled out.

I don't think it's that important to pick between VOO and VT. You can own one, but you can also pick a mix of both? Personally, I feel the markets tend to self-correct and move in unison over the long run because overall real economic activity also tends to move in unison. Because I believe this I would just buy whichever is undervalued when I happen to have available funds. A recent example would be me putting a good sum of money into a Russ2K etf last Nov/Dec. Not because I think the R2K will outperform the VOO over the ultra long run but because I felt the R2K was undervalued and lagged against the S&P500/100, QQQ, and Dow. Each person has a different investment strategy. Mine involves buying low because I don't sell often enough to maximize or be good at selling high. 

TL;DR you can own a one or the other, but you can also own a mix. I just buy whatever is undervalued.",zxc123zxc123,3,/r/investing/comments/okokvj/usa_vs_europe_vs_asia_not_china_fund_allocation/h5agd2f/,0.03,0.902,0.069,0.8945
4,EM," If you like Swedbank, these funds might be good to add emerging market exposure:

This one is global emerging markets, costs 0.51%:

https://swedbankrobur.auxality.com/fund/F000014XOW/access-edge-emerging-markets-c?lang=en

This one is Asia-only, so it excludes for example Brazil, Russia, South Africa, but it is only 0.2% ER. It's ex-Japan so won't overlap with your global developed market fund.

https://swedbankrobur.auxality.com/fund/F000014XP1/access-asien-c?lang=en

These also both have an ESG profile, attempting to avoid ""bad"" companies.

Both have big chunks of China, but again I would suggest only 10% or so in these and not to worry too much about the China chunk as it's only a % of a % of your overall portfolio.

In practice, most of emerging markets is in Asia, so limiting yourself to Asian EM may not be that significant. The first one is more diversified and would be my preference in the absence of the ER, but the second one is substantially cheaper. You're looking at only ~10% in Brazil, Russia, South Africa, the other 90% seems very similar anyway.",blorg,2,/r/investing/comments/okokvj/usa_vs_europe_vs_asia_not_china_fund_allocation/h5a9kb4/,0.028,0.929,0.043,0.3572

10,AI," Let's start with disclosures, I'm a professional software developer, hobby game developer.  I have a small long position in OTGLY (down about 40%) as part of a game sector portfolio (up 20%).  A real bear would be short, but I can tell you why it's one of my riskier positions.

Obviously, there are macro risks.  Europe had a lot of flooding this week, covid is on the rise there.  OTGLY is concentrated in its geography and IP in a way that Nintendo (for example) is not.

Brand risk.  Personally I'm neutral on this one.  There really is a brand issue from CP77's launch that will probably stick with enthusiasts.  On the other hand the game came out at a time when the world was pretty dark and we were all looking for something to feel good about, which is not necessarily repeatable.  Either way I think this angle has been discussed to death when product factors are more important.

For product factors, you have two issues.  The big one is management risk.  People talk a lot about management misleading the public on how PS4 is coming along for example.  In my experience, it's more like management is engaged in wishful thinking because they don't know or didn't find out the real situation.  It could be there's a culture of fear of telling your boss negative news but for whatever reason, the right information isn't circulating internally.

The other product factor is technical quality.  People talk about poor AI that spawns behind you for example.  That's a simple explanation, but having played both games it reminds me of how Roach spawns behind you in TW3.  That is, reusing a solution that they convinced themselves would work because it worked in their prior award-winning game.  Again this reminds me a little of what happens when only positive information circulates internally.

I think your outlook depends a lot on how you weigh those risks.  Personally I think there's a lot of upside if they can cross the bridge, but also a lot of challenges to doing so.  Personally I'm willing to take a small position and see how it went in a few years.",CodexRunicus2,4,/r/investing/comments/okxkar/whats_the_bear_case_on_cd_projekt_red_otgly/h5bb4fq/,0.078,0.805,0.117,0.9189

Which to me shows extremely poor management + a harmed reputation which will cause potential talents to avoid employment with them. Also they had a huge brain drain that I can't see them recovering from for the next 7-14 years. 

CYBRPK sold fairly well but it has absolutely no way of bringing in consistent revenue, combined with their demolished reputation their upcoming planned release for CYBRPK:Online will likely also be a huge flop.

They made a lot of money from cyberpunk, there was not a huge loss from refunds. They re shaped all project management and quality control after cyberpunk issues. Sorry but investors and gamers pushed too much for early release. There is a comunitee hungry for cyberpunk lore, mods open the door for long term users (see GTA5), nightcity is a work of art, I can accept the bugs for such amazing atmosphere.

26,CD," Interesting viewpoint.

I interpret Cyberpunk 2077 in the opposite way.

In my view, CD Projekt Red:

1. **Lost credibility with Sony and Microsoft.** They won't get so much marketing support from Playstation and Xbox anytime soon.
2. **Lost attractiveness as an employer.** It's not even just the terrible working conditions, but more importantly the taint of failure. Just ask yourself. How good does ""CD Projekt Red - Cyberpunk 2077"" look on your CV?
3. **Didn't have any real change in management.** They will make the same mistakes again. Results might vary.

35,AI," I mean GTA V and even GTA IV beats Cyberpunk by an insane margin on every single one of its gameplay aspects, and GTA V is nearly ten years old. GTA IV and V have better driving, AI that's light years ahead of Cyberpunk, better world systems (Cops, traffic, Wildlife, side content, side activities ect....every single aspect that makes a world 'lived in'). Other than story and maybe art direction there's really nothing that Cyberpunk does better and that's scary because anybody could create a decent story given enough focus on that aspect.


Also Witcher 3 was just way too overrated, the combat was honestly atrocious in that game, I just flat out quit half way through because the combat was terrible and the minute to minute gameplay outside of that wasnt good either. Beautiful game though.



At this point I have no faith in CDPR to create a GTA online type service, and when Cyberpunk 2 comes out in 4 years it will be essentially what Cyberpunk one should have been as a best case scenario. And that's if they completely nail all the systems they fucked up on.

42,APR," Not sure if this is best for the thread or its own post, but I'm curious about housing as an investment.


We're starting to look into buying and a lot of people say ""a house is an investment,"" and I just don't understand it. I'm wondering if someone can point out the flaws in my logic here and check my math here, or if I'm correct that in this situation (thanks Cook County IL property taxes), we'll be better off renting. What am I missing here? I understand that I'm treating this as a 30 year investment rather than hoping to quickly take advantage of a bubble/price spike at some point, but the problem with the stories I'm hearing about people doing so is they'll say ""Yeah, it's amazing, I bought my house for $400k and just sold it for $525k,"" but they're back with their spouse and kids living with their parents while they wait for the prices to drop again - assuming they will - otherwise they just made $125k that they'll eventually have to spend on an equivalent house, as their recent sale just proved that the market wants $525k for that house rather than the $400k they initially paid.


I tried the math for a rental property/three flat here, but let's assume it's a single family home.


Anyways, assuming a $700k purchase price, I'll (hypothetically) put 5% down, or $35k. That means I'm financing $665k. At a 3% APR, I'm paying $33,643 per year, or an extra $334k over the life of the loan. Property tax here in Cook County is 2.1% assessed at the moment, so another $14,700 annually. Then all the maintenance stuff that I don't pay for but I would as a homeowner, is another $5k annually estimated. So we're looking at $441k in property taxes on the life of the loan, and $110k over the life for maintenance.


The purchase price + cost of loan ($1,009,317) + property taxes ($441,000) + maintenance ($110,000) for the life of the loan is $1,560,317. It sounds like I'd need to double the price to make any sort of profit on this. Compare that to dropping that $35k in a 5% S&P fund, which should hit $150k over 30 years at 5%. What am I missing? Is the key to either accept it (meaning, I bought this not as an investment, but for security, etc) or get out more quickly to avoid paying interest?",chrisfarleyraejepsen,1,/r/investing/comments/okp06s/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h59zcvo/,0.039,0.867,0.094,0.9763

Microsoft? Biggest stock on the market in 1999. They're doing pretty great these days but after their stock price hit an all time high (ATH) of \~$59 back in December 1999 it languished in the mid-$20 to mid-$30 range for more than a decade. It didn't set a new ATH until late October 2016.

71,GOOD," I wrote a response to a comment I made two days ago on why we are now entering into a window where now is a time to be a lot more cautious if you are actively trading or controlling for risk. That comment probably wasn't seen, so resharing here for reference.

**What I am seeing that points towards a period of increased risk right now.**

For whatever it's worth, this doesn't mean that the risk will materialize, but the risk reward probability here is not great for a little while with higher risk for a more extended selloff than we've seen for quite a while.

* **Major breadth divergences:** A lot of classic technicians look at various breadth indicators, and I know that a lot of these are more or less giving off big warning signs. I don't follow these indicators, but I do use a custom index of leading cyclical stocks, assets, and ratios that historically tends to weaken ***prior*** to market selloffs. IE, before shit starts selling off hard, you'll usually notice that this index is going down while the S&P is still rising. That's very often a harbinger of a window of risk opening up. This is something I've personally built, so take it with a grain of salt (it's been extremely reliable for me however), but that's why I also mention other more traditional breadth indicators showing similar signs.
* **Macro Regime Shift:** I'm a big macro person, and the environment is changing. We've had two different macro regimes since covid-19 hit, the first being the predominantly tech driven rally (lockdown winners period) from April 2020 to October 2020. We've since been in a reflationary period from October 2020 until about now. That regime is shifting into something else right now, which is a natural product of base effects and moving past reflation. When macro regimes shift, what worked before in the previous few months often changes, sometimes dramatically.
   * Growth in inflation is peaking, although still fairly high right now. In the last month, that + continued positive overall growth + liquidity has put us into a goldilocks period which has been highly favorable for growth and technology. The risk however is that just like inflation coming down off peaks, growth will be doing so in the next few weeks / months as well.
   * The question isn't so much where inflation goes, but more about where inflation goes relative to growth. If inflation remains stubbornly high, we will get more of a stagflationary environment, but if inflation falls back to earth, we will easily get more of a deflationary type environment.
   * Overall, you can see some of these shifts by zooming out and looking at some of the ratios and performance between factors and exposures.
   * Corporate earnings are facing some insanely GOOD comps this quarter for the earnings season which is starting now. That obviously sounds good, but in markets that like to sell the news, it can often be a bad thing when you're sitting at the peak, which we are from a base effect perspective. I expect more guidance being issued this earning season around inflation cutting into margins, and I think there is a good chance that there will be a lot of selling after earnings despite blowout reports this quarter.
* **Vol Compression:** Volatility has been driven down and beaten down over quite some time, and we've gone a VERY long time without any significant correction. Part of this is a product of people bidding up volatility, which tends to cause the opposite effect when done en masse. A lot of that is rolling off here this week, and there aren't any obvious catalysts people are otherwise hedging for at this point, which can open up that potential for bigger moves.
   * I also look through various signals that are related to volatility, and there are quite a few things that are behaving in a way you would not expect for a market that is making new all time highs every day. That can sometimes be another negative divergence that can be a harbinger of things to come.
* **Positioning:** A lot of everything is very very very long here, also with a ton of leverage. This is true for systematic strategies, hedge funds, retail, etc. This works well and will continue to work well if inflow keeps flooding into markets, but once the marginal drivers of those inflows either slow down or stop, the game of musical chairs often starts waiting for a correction.
   * A lot of the drivers of those inflows are getting their source cut off or dramatically cut down to size. Inflation or rate increases cuts into leverage expansion for instance (increasing leverage = more buying of stocks = markets rising. This does the opposite in reverse of course). Then various moratoriums and stimulus programs are either getting cut off this month or already have been cut off, all of which have contributed to or allowed more buying of assets. Systematic strategies no longer have any bearish positions or positions on the sidelines, meaning that their ability to flood the market with new buys is no longer a thing.
   * Positioning by itself isn't likely to be a catalyst, but it can show you when there is heightened risk for a more sustained selling event.

&#x200B;

With all that said, it's not all negative. Corporate buybacks are coming back, and that's a quite supportive and can help compress volatility further here. I tend to think that US markets will continue to receive capital flows from international sources, which should be market supportive. There are other not so bad things too. To summarize, there simply is a heightened risk of a drawdown right now for various reasons. This is not any attempt to form a bigger picture view on things, but more just an outlook over the next few weeks here.

Also, for anybody who follows [squeezemetrics](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix?), there are some relatively bullish prints in the free darkpool index that is published there.

73,VERY," Can someone please confirm that this scenario is not possible on any common exchanges (for example the NYSE)...

Let's say I'm a company that is both a HF and MM and although there is supposed to be a wall between these portions of our business I am willing to bend rules to profit more...so my HF department makes it obvious that I want a certain stock price to decrease. The market price of a stock is simply the LAST price that an order was filed at (right?). Now my MM business is supposed to process order flows the same regardless of what security is being ordered (I believe), but I know my HF business would like me to decrease the price of a certain stock so I tell my algo to strategically arrange the processing of the orders to drive the price down by fulfilling the lowest priced order last.

For example:

Let's say the current market price of said stock is $162.00

Within 1ms I receive the following bids and asks for this stock...

Order	Price	         time the order was received

Bid 1	limit $162.00	   12:34:20:00

Ask 1	limit $162.00	   12:34:20:00

Bid 2	limit $161.99	   12:34:20:01

Ask 2	limit $161.99    12:34:20:05

Bid 3	limit $162.00	   12:34:20:07

Bid 4	limit $162.00	   12:34:20:08

Ask 3	limit $162.02	   12:34:20:35

Bid 5	limit $162.02	   12:34:20:55

One would expect that orders would happen FIFO (First In First Out)...but I'm not sure that the law requires that. If it was FIFO then Bid 1 would be filled by Ask 1 and the Price would stay at $162.00, then Bid 2 would be filled by Ask 2 and the market price would decrease to $161.99 and then Bid 5 would be filled by Ask 3 and the new market price would end up being $162.02...i.e. the price ultimately goes up.

However, I want this price to go down so I don't process the orders this way...instead I process Bid 5 with Ask 3 to get it out of the way and the price goes up (temporarily) to $162.02, then I process Bid 1 with Ask 1 to get the price back down to $162.00 and finish with Bid 2 being filled by Ask 2 and ultimately the price of the stock goes down to $161.99.

In this example there is more buy pressure than sell pressure and the stock price still drops. It is very simple market manipulation and if I could buffer the orders longer and process them in batches it would be even easier to do this...

Looking to someone to tell me I am misunderstanding how order flows are processed and this would be technically impossible (for both ATM and OTM)...or maybe tell me this is technically possible, but the SEC would totally be able to KNOW and PROVE this is happening in real-time and would put an end to that VERY QUICKLY with swift merciless justice.

&#x200B;

Edit: thanks for the information...your answers have helped expose my ignorance and shown me that my example isn't formulated properly and doesn't have the right players. I think I have a better understanding of the mechanics of it now with your help...but I have more research to do to understand the flow of orders better. I'm still thinking this method might be a plausible way (if there is enough volume) for certain players (brokers maybe?) to manipulate prices slightly, and I'm just trying to understand if that is true or if there are safe guards against it. I understand now that once the order gets to the exchange there are safe guards...just not sure if there are before it gets submitted to the exchange.",AnApebyanyotherName,2,/r/investing/comments/okp0r8/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h5aojnh/,0.043,0.871,0.086,0.9762

90,ABC," That is not really how MM work from my understanding also the MM does not route orders the exchange does;  all the mm does is post how much they are willing to buy/sell a stock for and post those to the exchange, the exchange will route the order to the one offering the best price

MM1 will say

I will buy up to 500 lots of stock ABC at Price 160.00

I will sell up to 500 lots of stock ABC at a price or 160.10

Now there are also competing MM, so another one could look at that and can say ""That 0.10 spread look nice, I can do better"" and post

MM2 will say

I will buy up to 200 lots of stock ABC at Price 160.02

I will sell up to 200 lots of stock ABC at a price or 160.08

with that MM2 is especially setting the price as its giving the best buy/sell

When you place an order the exchange will route you to MM2. Or to make things more complex lets say I want to sell 100 shares and you want to buy 100 shares, we both use schwab, its with in the rules schwab can say ""why go to the exchange and pay the bid/ask and the exchange fee we can trade off exchange  and give both buyer and seller a better price , the seller will get 160.04 (vs 160.02) and the buyer will by for 160.06 (vs 160.08) or something like that.

91,HP," ""The Intelligent Investor"" and ""The Little Book that Beats the Market"" have the core methods for value investing. 

But don't overthink it. Alpha, Beta, etc are all worthless from a valuation perspective so lose all the technical speak when thinking long term value. And remember the public impression is wrong OVER 50% of the time. This has been proven with scientific studies on the topic. Essentially, whatever the general consensus is, you will generally go the other way. If all you did was go the opposite of public consensus in terms of direction and asset class, you would be correct more than 50% of the time (not a lot more in a random study, but more, nonetthelss)

On valuations, specifically, I use a thought experiment in my classes. Think of a ""magic box"" that never breaks and gives you $1 on January 1 of each year. And suppose you could buy this little magic box at markets. How much would you pay for such a box? My scenario introduces a zero-risk investment. Seasoned investors would equate such a box to a treasury bond. So maybe you would say $100 and agree to a 1% return because of that $1 it generates every year, or maybe you think it is $50 because you think a 2% return for zero risk is reasonable. Whatever it is, it is your perception of the value. And that is what you should pay for it. Let's say you think it is $100. If you see somebody selling them for $80, what would you do? Now suppose you see someone selling for $75? As the price falls, you should be more excited to pick them up because you believe it is worth $100. Now, let's suppose you are confident in your method of valuation and your justifications. FIne, keep buying more as you see people selling for less than that value. And avoid buying from anyone selling for something more than your value. 

That is the basic premise of value investing. Everything else introduces complications that frequently don't help your decision. For example, EPS could be equated to that $1 in the example. A dividend or stock buy-back are methods for sharing that EPS with shareholders. But it isn't the only way. If the company (the ""magic box""), has a history of using capital wisely but doesn't share with shareholders, you should see the stock value increase as more EPS is generated since the capital is retained and put to work. That's it. If the stock price falls below your valuation, you buy. If it goes over, you sell or hold. Quoting Warren Buffett: “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.”

The biggest value buys can be found during market declines. In general, the public act like schools of fish and change directions simply because everyone else did. How many times have you seen people recommending a ""buy"" BECAUSE the market is going up? That approach is the surest way to lose your capital. Determine your valuations from your own methods and stick with them. Sometimes you won't have any opportunities and you have to sit back with some ETF's ($SPY for general holdings or $VFIIX if you want the equivalent of cash). Use stock search tools to find equities that match your valuation rules. When you find one that matches, pounce on it. Second guess your rules, not the company. I remember 2008 when HP was trading under$14 and generating $4 of EPS annually. The stock kept falling and I just doubled down as it fell. When the public stopped freaking out, it promptly jumped over $20 (my target). Things change as the business climate changes so keep an eye on management teams and how they react. 

In short, hold to your rules and don't let the public consensus sway your determination. You will refine your methods over time and make far more money than any technical investor.",Franklin_Rules,4,/r/investing/comments/okp0r8/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h5a0o77/,0.072,0.827,0.1,0.9533

93,CASH," I-bonds right now provide a great return for CASH, but not a great college investment in the long term.  

I-bonds are killing a high yield savings account right now.  However, the overall return of an i-bond has two components:  The fixed rate and the rate adjusted for inflation. Right now that is 0.00% and \~1.77% respectively for the 6 months 5/2021-11/2021.  The fixed rate will always stay at 0%.  The inflation rate is adjusted every 6 months. So while the absolute return is high (3.54% annually), this rate is purely 100% inflation.  The real return therefore will never be more than 0% and at it's worst, it could still be negative.   

It does beat the hell out of 0.4% in a savings account however!",spartybasketball,1,/r/investing/comments/okyq3v/comparing_529_accounts_vs_series_i_savings_bonds/h5bd5cy/,0.161,0.761,0.078,-0.945
94,AGI," Yeah with a 529 it's basically just a Roth IRA. You start in stocks when the kids are young and then move over to bonds when they're about to start college so the funds are more stable when you need them. 

Also, you could also just use a taxable brokerage account if your AGI is below the 15% cap gains tax threshold, the 529 is for people above that so they don't have to pay taxes on the earnings.",Thomas12255,2,/r/investing/comments/okyq3v/comparing_529_accounts_vs_series_i_savings_bonds/h5b6u8c/,0.0,0.896,0.104,0.7498
