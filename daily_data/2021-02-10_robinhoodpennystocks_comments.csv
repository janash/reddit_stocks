6,SNDL," SNDL will most likely climb Thursday and Friday as its become more and more obvious it will meet requirements to maintain its standing with the NASDAQ exchange. It will probably see a decent rise once it complies with the requirements and then a sell off after. I'm thinking this sell off will happen Monday midday. Even after that, it still has potential for growth as the Biden administration focuses on criminal reform. Decriminalization of marijuana is a popular part of this and the MORE has a real chance of passing. Even if it doesn't, the stock will rise in anticipation of it passing.

61,SNDL," I don't know what you're doing to be able to tell you what to do differently.

But given your account age, I think some good blanket advice is that if a stock had a big jump in yesterday or overnight, it's probably too late to buy in and expect to get much of a return. That's a recipe for losing money rather than making it. You need to be unemotional about your decision-making and ignore any FOMO. FOMO is what gets you losses.

For example, I told myself I'd sell SNDL today at open. I waited because it was still climbing, and lost out on about $6-$7 because it had a dip 15 minutes after open. Not much right now, but if we're using the same 2% growth scale, that's $880-$1,020 a year from now.",badger0511,6,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lgtd09/slow_fast_lets_get_these_gains_people/gmtn8y2/,0.054,0.906,0.041,0.0772

Do a little DD on the entire topic and you'll understand the significance of every single patient having such a reduction in ki67 levels and little to no side effects. That coupled with the FDA compassionate used study- which if you didn't know.. means current medicine couldn't help the patient. Using endoxifen, the patient hasn't had a recurrence of breast cancer in two years.

I get the skepticism, but this is a life changing medication. Literally life and death for some people who can't take Tamoxifen. This can also help to avoid chemo for some latients.

108,AN," I echo this sentiment. I have a stake in ATOS, but people can't rush into this with blinders on. There is no guarantee, here.

The first step of the study was to administer Atossa's Endoxifen orally to 8 patients in Victoria, Australia.

These patients were all diagnosed with breast cancer and were awaiting mastectomy. The goal was to reduce Ki-67 levels, which (I'm not a doctor) are levels correlated with malignancy in breast cancer, while these patients awaited surgery over a 21 day period. If 2 of the 8 patients showed reduced Ki-67s, then the study would be expanded to 17 patients. 

It seems, based on the recent release, that this was reduced to 7 patients? It's unclear. 

Atossa's website lists that ""all patients (N=6) experienced a significant reduction in Ki-67"". (Where did these other one or two patients go?) Atossa concluded that this was significant enough to proceed to the next stage of clinical trials which would potentially cut off a year in the approval process.

The company offers duplex two-way voice and data products, including mobile voice and data satellite communications services and equipment for remote business continuity, recreational usage, safety, emergency preparedness and response, and other applications; fixed voice and data satellite communications services and equipment at industrial, commercial, and residential sites, as well as rural villages and ships; and satellite data modem services comprising asynchronous and packet data services. It also provides SPOT consumer retail products, such as SPOT satellite GPS messenger for personal tracking, emergency location, and messaging solutions; and SPOT Trace, an anti-theft and asset tracking
 device. In addition, the company offers commercial Internet of Things one-way transmission products to track cargo containers and rail cars, as well as to monitor utility meters, and oil and gas assets. Further, it sells wholesale minutes to independent gateway operators (IGOs); and provides engineering services, such as hardware and software designs to develop specific applications; and installation of gateways and antennas.""

David Kagan
Chief Executive Officer
David Kagan currently serves as CEO of Globalstar. Prior to re-joining Globalstar as President and COO in December 2017, Kagan was the COO of SpeedCast International Limited. He served as President of ITC Global, a premier global VSAT satellite services provider from August 2014 through September 2015. He was also the President and CEO of Globe Wireless from June 2011 through January 2014 when it was sold to Inmarsat PLC.

L. Barbee Ponder IV
General Counsel and Vice President of Regulatory 
Mr. Ponder has previously served as Senior Regulatory Counsel for BellSouth Corporation in Washington, D.C. where he provided representation before the Federal Communications Commission, Congress and the White House on issues concerning 1996

 Telecommunications Act, deregulation of broadband services and tax issues concerning the telecommunications industry.
Guys...This man worked for the FCC on the telecommunications act in 1996. He knows the regulations and rules behind telecom industry (5G).

 Technology, Current Contracts
Band53 technology created by GSAT is being used by companies like Nokia and recently
Qualcomm. From a press release: ""Globalstar has worked to develop the Band 53 ecosystem with a group of priority partners like Nokia. Globalstar‚Äôs Band 53 is a prime mid-band spectrum resource that we offer to our partners for deployment with customers that otherwise would not have access to the benefits of licensed spectrum. The combination of Nokia‚Äôs global reach and Globalstar‚Äôs Band 53 terrestrial authorizations in multiple countries around the globe present an exciting opportunity for secure wireless solutions.""
This technology is the absolute future of secure 5G connections in not only telecommunications, but also in the EV landscape. Yes you heard it right, GSAT already uses their technology in auto makers such as
 Fiat Chrysler and Jeep. GSAT has the technology to jump fully into the connected car market, especially the ever poipular EV connected car market.
GSAT owns 24 ground stations that serve as points between satellites and over 120 countries. The reach is already there. They are only limited by which contracts they will inevitably pick up. See: Nokia, Jeep, Qualcomm. (So far)

Future Growth
With the world becoming ever more connected, these smaller but established companies are just waiting to boom. Every partnership that GSAT sees can increase its cap 2-3 fold. Just a basic true evaluation by some analysts see GSAT worth 9.25 Billion (pre Qualcomm deal) which puts them at $6.60 a share at current valuations!
If you don't believe me, go look at what Nokia has said about their partnership with Globalstar: https://investors.globalstar.com/news-releases/news-release-details/globalstar-announces-nokia- deployment-over-licensed-band-53-port

Current Valuation
 Currently GSAT sits at under 3 billion market cap (after its 80% gain today), which according to some analysts is over 3x under what it currently should be. If this isn't a reason to snag it cheap I don't know what is.

TLDR: Buy this 100 bagger before its too late. GSAT to the moon. Oh and did I mention ARKX ETF is coming soon (SPACE STOCK ETF)? Cathie Woods can bring this stock to the stars, fuck the moon.

Qualcomm. From a press release: ""Globalstar has worked to develop the Band 53 ecosystem with a group of priority partners like Nokia. Globalstar‚Äôs Band 53 is a prime mid-band spectrum resource that we offer to our partners for deployment with customers that otherwise would not have access to the benefits of licensed spectrum. The combination of Nokia‚Äôs global reach and Globalstar‚Äôs Band 53 terrestrial authorizations in multiple countries around the globe present an exciting opportunity for secure wireless solutions.""
This technology is the absolute future of secure 5G connections in not only telecommunications, but also in the EV landscape. Yes you heard it right, GSAT already uses their technology in auto makers such as
 Fiat Chrysler and Jeep. GSAT has the technology to jump fully into the connected car market, especially the ever poipular EV connected car market.
GSAT owns 24 ground stations that serve as points between satellites and over 120 countries. The reach is already there. They are only limited by which contracts they will inevitably pick up. See: Nokia, Jeep, Qualcomm. (So far)

Future Growth
With the world becoming ever more connected, these smaller but established companies are just waiting to boom. Every partnership that GSAT sees can increase its cap 2-3 fold. Just a basic true evaluation by some analysts see GSAT worth 9.25 Billion (pre Qualcomm deal) which puts them at $6.60 a share at current valuations!
If you don't believe me, go look at what Nokia has said about their partnership with Globalstar: https://investors.globalstar.com/news-releases/news-release-details/globalstar-announces-nokia- deployment-over-licensed-band-53-port

Current Valuation
 Currently GSAT sits at under 3 billion market cap (after its 80% gain today), which according to some analysts is over 3x under what it currently should be. If this isn't a reason to snag it cheap I don't know what is.

TLDR: Buy this 100 bagger before its too late. GSAT to the moon. Oh and did I mention ARKX ETF is coming soon (SPACE STOCK ETF)? Cathie Woods can bring this stock to the stars, fuck the moon.

Compare the 5G demand to Straight Path Communications in 2017. There was a vicious bidding war between Verizon and AT&T to acquire the next big 5G telecommunications company, StraightPath. I'm here to tell you history is going to repeat itself in GSAT.

Simplywall.st gives you the run down of this company: ""Globalstar, Inc. provides mobile satellite services worldwide. The company offers duplex two-way voice and data products, including mobile voice and data satellite communications services and equipment for remote business continuity, recreational usage, safety, emergency preparedness and response, and other applications; fixed voice and data satellite communications services and equipment at industrial, commercial, and residential sites, as well as rural villages and ships; and satellite data modem services comprising asynchronous and packet data services. It also provides SPOT consumer retail products, such as SPOT satellite GPS messenger for personal tracking, emergency location, and messaging solutions; and SPOT Trace, an anti-theft and asset tracking

In addition, the company offers commercial Internet of Things one-way transmission products to track cargo containers and rail cars, as well as to monitor utility meters, and oil and gas assets.

Gran Tierra Energy Inc, a company focused on oil exploration and production in Colombia and Ecuador, today announced the Company's 2020 year-end reserves as evaluated by the Company's independent qualified reserves evaluator McDaniel & Associates Consultants Ltd. (""McDaniel"") in a report with an effective date of December 31, 2020 (the ""GTE McDaniel Reserves Report"") and an operational update.

All dollar amounts are in United States (""U.S."") dollars and all reserves and production volumes are on a working interest before royalties (""WI"") basis. Production is expressed in barrels (""bbl"") of oil per day (""bopd"") or bbl of oil equivalent (""boe"") per day (""boepd""), while reserves are expressed in bbl, boe or million boe (""MMBOE""), unless otherwise indicated. All reserves values, future net revenue and ancillary information contained in this press release have been prepared by McDaniel and calculated in compliance with Canadian National Instrument 51-101 ‚Äì Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities (‚ÄúNI 51-101‚Äù) and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (""COGEH"") and derived from the GTE McDaniel Reserves Report, unless otherwise expressly stated. The following reserves categories are discussed in this press release: Proved Developed Producing (""PDP""), Proved (""1P""), 1P plus Probable (""2P"") and 2P plus Possible (""3P"").

Commenting on Gran Tierra's 2020 year-end reserves, operational update and future plans, Gary Guidry, President and Chief Executive Officer of Gran Tierra, said: ‚ÄúOur teams in Colombia, Ecuador and Canada rose to meet the many challenges of 2020 through their diligent management of COVID-19 safety protocols and sharp focus on maintaining and increasing the value of our assets. As a result, we are pleased to announce significant reserve additions in both the PDP and 1P categories, despite our large reductions in capital investment during 2020. This achievement demonstrates that the Company's core conventional oil assets continue to show positive waterflood responses and low base decline rates.

The advancement of our waterflooding efforts in the Acordionero, Costayaco and Moqueta oil fields has clearly allowed Gran Tierra to continue to convert Probable and Possible reserves into the Proved reserves categories. Even though we decided during 2020 to reduce capital spending, we believe the Company's excellent performance in terms of PDP and 1P reserves additions is a testament to the quality of our assets.

With our strategy, we believe Gran Tierra is well-positioned for the resumption of prudent growth in 2021 and strong potential free cash flow1 generation. We have already increased production approximately 24% from our third quarter 2020 average, which we believe reflects the strength of our Proved reserves. Our 2021 capital budget of $130 to $150 million is a balanced, returns-focused program which prioritizes free cash flow generation over the rate of development, exploration and production growth, with investment primarily directed to the Acordionero and Costayaco oil fields. With a keen focus on further strengthening our balance sheet, we plan to direct free cash flow to ongoing debt reduction in 2021 and beyond.

During fourth quarter 2020, Gran Tierra resumed development activities throughout our portfolio, including the ongoing well workover operations and the restart of development drilling at Acordionero. We also restarted workover operations at Costayaco and look forward to a planned initiation of development drilling in that field during second quarter 2021. We forecast 2021 average production of 28,000 to 30,000 bopd for the Company.

Our 2021 plans are fully aligned with Gran Tierra's ""Beyond Compliance Policy"" which focuses on our commitments to environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") excellence. Gran Tierra looks for significant opportunities and benefits to the environment and communities by voluntarily and proactively taking steps to protect the environment and provide social benefits because it is the right thing to do. In 2020, we also had our best safety year in the history of the Company.

We believe that Gran Tierra successfully navigated the exceptional challenges of 2020 and are excited to return to an economically sound growth trajectory in 2021 and beyond, with a focus on free cash flow generation and debt reduction.""


-> During 2020, Gran Tierra achieved:
Material PDP and 1P reserves additions, in particular at Acordionero, Costayaco and Moqueta, as a result of ongoing successful waterflooding operations

PDP reserves replacement of 133% with PDP reserves additions of 11.0 MMBOE
1P reserves replacement of 100% with 1P reserves additions of 8.3 MMBOE

Finding and development costs (""F&D"") including future development costs (""FDC"") of $5.06/boe on a PDP basis and $2.65/boe on a 1P basis
F&D recycle ratios including FDC of 3.5 times (PDP) and 6.7 times (1P)

Significant reserves additions at Acordionero: 7.1 MMBOE (PDP) and 2.6 MMBOE (1P)
Despite a material reduction in the McDaniel's forecast oil price assumptions relative to one year ago (the average Brent oil price over the next 5 years in the GTE McDaniel Reserves Report is $54.04/bbl):
Gran Tierra's 2020 year-end 1P NPV10 after tax decreased only 21% compared to 2019 year-end
This performance was achieved in part due to large reductions in forecast operating costs based on the actual savings achieved by the Company in 2020
As of December 31, 2020, McDaniel estimates that Gran Tierra's total 1P undiscounted operating costs over the remaining life of the Company's fields are approximately 26% less than the McDaniel estimate as of December 31, 2019*

Acordionero, Costayaco, Moqueta and Suroriente now represent 83% of Gran Tierra's 1P reserves and 78% of 2P reserves

PDP reserves account for 55% of 1P reserves and 1P reserves account for 59% of 2P reserves, demonstrating the strength of the Company's reserves base and the potential future conversion of Probable reserves into 1P reserves and Proved Undeveloped reserves into PDP reserves

Gran Tierra's mature waterflood assets, Costayaco and Moqueta, continued to grow and deliver value, with total reserves additions of 3.8 MMBOE (PDP) and 5.5 MMBOE (1P)

FDC are forecast to be $312 million for 1P reserves and $565 million for 2P reserves
Realized a 39% increase in 2P reserve life index to 17 years and a 51% increase in 1P reserve life index to 10 years",Junior767676,18,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lgi8fi/daily_discussion_thread/gmufo04/,0.009,0.866,0.126,0.9988

Our 2021 capital budget of $130 to $150 million is a balanced, returns-focused program which prioritizes free cash flow generation over the rate of development, exploration and production growth, with investment primarily directed to the Acordionero and Costayaco oil fields. With a keen focus on further strengthening our balance sheet, we plan to direct free cash flow to ongoing debt reduction in 2021 and beyond.

During fourth quarter 2020, Gran Tierra resumed development activities throughout our portfolio, including the ongoing well workover operations and the restart of development drilling at Acordionero. We also restarted workover operations at Costayaco and look forward to a planned initiation of development drilling in that field during second quarter 2021. We forecast 2021 average production of 28,000 to 30,000 bopd for the Company.

Our 2021 plans are fully aligned with Gran Tierra's ""Beyond Compliance Policy"" which focuses on our commitments to environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") excellence. Gran Tierra looks for significant opportunities and benefits to the environment and communities by voluntarily and proactively taking steps to protect the environment and provide social benefits because it is the right thing to do. In 2020, we also had our best safety year in the history of the Company.

We believe that Gran Tierra successfully navigated the exceptional challenges of 2020 and are excited to return to an economically sound growth trajectory in 2021 and beyond, with a focus on free cash flow generation and debt reduction.""


-> During 2020, Gran Tierra achieved:
Material PDP and 1P reserves additions, in particular at Acordionero, Costayaco and Moqueta, as a result of ongoing successful waterflooding operations

PDP reserves replacement of 133% with PDP reserves additions of 11.0 MMBOE
1P reserves replacement of 100% with 1P reserves additions of 8.3 MMBOE

Finding and development costs (""F&D"") including future development costs (""FDC"") of $5.06/boe on a PDP basis and $2.65/boe on a 1P basis
F&D recycle ratios including FDC of 3.5 times (PDP) and 6.7 times (1P)

Significant reserves additions at Acordionero: 7.1 MMBOE (PDP) and 2.6 MMBOE (1P)
Despite a material reduction in the McDaniel's forecast oil price assumptions relative to one year ago (the average Brent oil price over the next 5 years in the GTE McDaniel Reserves Report is $54.04/bbl):
Gran Tierra's 2020 year-end 1P NPV10 after tax decreased only 21% compared to 2019 year-end
This performance was achieved in part due to large reductions in forecast operating costs based on the actual savings achieved by the Company in 2020
As of December 31, 2020, McDaniel estimates that Gran Tierra's total 1P undiscounted operating costs over the remaining life of the Company's fields are approximately 26% less than the McDaniel estimate as of December 31, 2019*

Acordionero, Costayaco, Moqueta and Suroriente now represent 83% of Gran Tierra's 1P reserves and 78% of 2P reserves

PDP reserves account for 55% of 1P reserves and 1P reserves account for 59% of 2P reserves, demonstrating the strength of the Company's reserves base and the potential future conversion of Probable reserves into 1P reserves and Proved Undeveloped reserves into PDP reserves

Gran Tierra's mature waterflood assets, Costayaco and Moqueta, continued to grow and deliver value, with total reserves additions of 3.8 MMBOE (PDP) and 5.5 MMBOE (1P)

FDC are forecast to be $312 million for 1P reserves and $565 million for 2P reserves
Realized a 39% increase in 2P reserve life index to 17 years and a 51% increase in 1P reserve life index to 10 years",Junior767676,18,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lgi8fi/daily_discussion_thread/gmufo04/,0.009,0.866,0.126,0.9988

475,DD," DD depends on what you're doing: investing or trading. If you're trading, you want to look at technical analysis and social media trends that pump a stock up way past its value. Then you want to figure out how to get out at the right time. Here's a good read on technical analysis: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technical-analysis-of-stocks-and-trends.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technical-analysis-of-stocks-and-trends.asp) It requires a good screener to see live movement. I have TradingView on my phone for a screener, but I know it's not as good as what the pros have. I've only been doing this for two weeks, but it seems like the professional traders have made a killing off of us newbies who are buying into greed (lines that go straight up) because we think that means it's about to go to the moon.

If you're interested in **investing** in a company, you need to look at fundamentals. Just google the company and start finding every bit of information and DD out there to see if you believe it has serious growth potential. [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp) Then, try to get news alerts for the ticker, and just forget about it for a few months.

478,GTE," How short-term of a target are you trying to hit? 

With the correction you may have missed the GTE short-term, but there is a chance it's still got some short-term growth ahead. It's a pretty solid long-term post covid play. Oil indicators are good for gauging when GTE is a pump or on more natural growth.

BDRBF - it's barcoding so at least it isn't sinking. And the correction didn't hit it too much. And it's being talked about. I think it's a better swing trade in the coming week with the volatility if that's what you're looking for. It's on a steady bullish trend regardless IMO, but I don't know how MUCH it can recover, and even a full recover isn't going to get you giant gains.

But we're talking $50. That's about a hundred shares man. Pennies move miles. If it starts to pump set that stop loss where you're comfortable.",DredRedBeard,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lgi8fi/daily_discussion_thread/gmtt3xf/,0.042,0.727,0.231,0.9872

497,AGTC," I usually look at CNN Business or Yahoo for a lot of different stocks. On the page of AGTC on CNN Business, the median price forecast of the analysts is $14, with a high estimate of $35, which doesn't have much evidence that it'll get up to that so that's why I doubt it now. The low prediction is $9, so just at the surface level it looks pretty good over the next few months or really quick. 

Here's the link for the CNN Forecast: https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=AGTC

EDIT: I also use just the ""News"" function in Google when I search a stock. A big one that shows up a lot of the time is Investors Observer. Here is one on AGTC, though it doesn't support the $30 (which I still think is BS), it does have their analysts saying it can raise 255% over the next 12 months: https://www.investorsobserver.com/news/stock-update/where-does-wall-street-think-applied-genetic-technologies-corp-agtc-stock-will-go",TheMallCop,18,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lgi8fi/daily_discussion_thread/gmro9ip/,0.049,0.91,0.042,-0.0056

Gran Tierra Energy Inc, a company focused on oil exploration and production in Colombia and Ecuador, today announced the Company's 2020 year-end reserves as evaluated by the Company's independent qualified reserves evaluator McDaniel & Associates Consultants Ltd. (""McDaniel"") in a report with an effective date of December 31, 2020 (the ""GTE McDaniel Reserves Report"") and an operational update.

All dollar amounts are in United States (""U.S."") dollars and all reserves and production volumes are on a working interest before royalties (""WI"") basis. Production is expressed in barrels (""bbl"") of oil per day (""bopd"") or bbl of oil equivalent (""boe"") per day (""boepd""), while reserves are expressed in bbl, boe or million boe (""MMBOE""), unless otherwise indicated. All reserves values, future net revenue and ancillary information contained in this press release have been prepared by McDaniel and calculated in compliance with Canadian National Instrument 51-101 ‚Äì Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities (‚ÄúNI 51-101‚Äù) and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (""COGEH"") and derived from the GTE McDaniel Reserves Report, unless otherwise expressly stated. The following reserves categories are discussed in this press release: Proved Developed Producing (""PDP""), Proved (""1P""), 1P plus Probable (""2P"") and 2P plus Possible (""3P"").

Commenting on Gran Tierra's 2020 year-end reserves, operational update and future plans, Gary Guidry, President and Chief Executive Officer of Gran Tierra, said: ‚ÄúOur teams in Colombia, Ecuador and Canada rose to meet the many challenges of 2020 through their diligent management of COVID-19 safety protocols and sharp focus on maintaining and increasing the value of our assets. As a result, we are pleased to announce significant reserve additions in both the PDP and 1P categories, despite our large reductions in capital investment during 2020. This achievement demonstrates that the Company's core conventional oil assets continue to show positive waterflood responses and low base decline rates.

The advancement of our waterflooding efforts in the Acordionero, Costayaco and Moqueta oil fields has clearly allowed Gran Tierra to continue to convert Probable and Possible reserves into the Proved reserves categories. Even though we decided during 2020 to reduce capital spending, we believe the Company's excellent performance in terms of PDP and 1P reserves additions is a testament to the quality of our assets.

With our strategy, we believe Gran Tierra is well-positioned for the resumption of prudent growth in 2021 and strong potential free cash flow1 generation. We have already increased production approximately 24% from our third quarter 2020 average, which we believe reflects the strength of our Proved reserves. Our 2021 capital budget of $130 to $150 million is a balanced, returns-focused program which prioritizes free cash flow generation over the rate of development, exploration and production growth, with investment primarily directed to the Acordionero and Costayaco oil fields. With a keen focus on further strengthening our balance sheet, we plan to direct free cash flow to ongoing debt reduction in 2021 and beyond.

During fourth quarter 2020, Gran Tierra resumed development activities throughout our portfolio, including the ongoing well workover operations and the restart of development drilling at Acordionero. We also restarted workover operations at Costayaco and look forward to a planned initiation of development drilling in that field during second quarter 2021. We forecast 2021 average production of 28,000 to 30,000 bopd for the Company.

Our 2021 plans are fully aligned with Gran Tierra's ""Beyond Compliance Policy"" which focuses on our commitments to environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") excellence. Gran Tierra looks for significant opportunities and benefits to the environment and communities by voluntarily and proactively taking steps to protect the environment and provide social benefits because it is the right thing to do. In 2020, we also had our best safety year in the history of the Company.

We believe that Gran Tierra successfully navigated the exceptional challenges of 2020 and are excited to return to an economically sound growth trajectory in 2021 and beyond, with a focus on free cash flow generation and debt reduction.""


-> During 2020, Gran Tierra achieved:
Material PDP and 1P reserves additions, in particular at Acordionero, Costayaco and Moqueta, as a result of ongoing successful waterflooding operations

PDP reserves replacement of 133% with PDP reserves additions of 11.0 MMBOE
1P reserves replacement of 100% with 1P reserves additions of 8.3 MMBOE

Finding and development costs (""F&D"") including future development costs (""FDC"") of $5.06/boe on a PDP basis and $2.65/boe on a 1P basis
F&D recycle ratios including FDC of 3.5 times (PDP) and 6.7 times (1P)

Significant reserves additions at Acordionero: 7.1 MMBOE (PDP) and 2.6 MMBOE (1P)
Despite a material reduction in the McDaniel's forecast oil price assumptions relative to one year ago (the average Brent oil price over the next 5 years in the GTE McDaniel Reserves Report is $54.04/bbl):
Gran Tierra's 2020 year-end 1P NPV10 after tax decreased only 21% compared to 2019 year-end
This performance was achieved in part due to large reductions in forecast operating costs based on the actual savings achieved by the Company in 2020
As of December 31, 2020, McDaniel estimates that Gran Tierra's total 1P undiscounted operating costs over the remaining life of the Company's fields are approximately 26% less than the McDaniel estimate as of December 31, 2019*

Acordionero, Costayaco, Moqueta and Suroriente now represent 83% of Gran Tierra's 1P reserves and 78% of 2P reserves

PDP reserves account for 55% of 1P reserves and 1P reserves account for 59% of 2P reserves, demonstrating the strength of the Company's reserves base and the potential future conversion of Probable reserves into 1P reserves and Proved Undeveloped reserves into PDP reserves

Gran Tierra's mature waterflood assets, Costayaco and Moqueta, continued to grow and deliver value, with total reserves additions of 3.8 MMBOE (PDP) and 5.5 MMBOE (1P)

FDC are forecast to be $312 million for 1P reserves and $565 million for 2P reserves
Realized a 39% increase in 2P reserve life index to 17 years and a 51% increase in 1P reserve life index to 10 years",Junior767676,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lgu8dr/gte_skyrocketing/gmuyz56/,0.009,0.866,0.126,0.9988

674,AGTC," So obligatory ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a financial advisor‚Äù, but there‚Äôs a good reason to assume AGTC will perform well. I‚Äôve noticed some stuff going on with AGTC. Blackrock and Empery picked up a ton of shares recently. Blackrock increased their position by 270%. Which is already a bullish sign, but two things strike me as unusual: First, securities in this sector drop a few dollars after earnings reports as it‚Äôs usually negative (traders will then buy since its discounted). So why is blackrock increasing their position by 270% 2 weeks before earnings? 

Second, the price hasn‚Äôt really changed dramatically since blackrock picked up shares, which is also unusual, and could mean that insiders are intentionally trying to dilute shares to keep the price low. 

But there‚Äôs something else: There have been rumors about a Sanofi buyout, which seems to imply there‚Äôs some breakthrough w AGTC‚Äôs products. Big pharma companies don‚Äôt develop drugs anymore because it simply isnt profitable. What do they do instead? They let small therapeutics companies go broke, and every now and then, they buy into a company which has a billion dollar idea so they can make a ton of profit off it. And the rumor that Sanofi would do that is up in the air.

It‚Äôs also made me think: Why are investors so bullish on a product that helps genetic colorblindness? Like it isn‚Äôt a detrimental serious problem that people face. My theory is that while a remedy for genetic colorblindness may be something they‚Äôve done, sanofi sees a wide variety of applications for their technology that could be used for things much worse than color blindness, and then Blackrock and Empery saw this too and increased their positions.

All dollar amounts are in United States (""U.S."") dollars and all reserves and production volumes are on a working interest before royalties (""WI"") basis. Production is expressed in barrels (""bbl"") of oil per day (""bopd"") or bbl of oil equivalent (""boe"") per day (""boepd""), while reserves are expressed in bbl, boe or million boe (""MMBOE""), unless otherwise indicated. All reserves values, future net revenue and ancillary information contained in this press release have been prepared by McDaniel and calculated in compliance with Canadian National Instrument 51-101 ‚Äì Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities (‚ÄúNI 51-101‚Äù) and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (""COGEH"") and derived from the GTE McDaniel Reserves Report, unless otherwise expressly stated. The following reserves categories are discussed in this press release: Proved Developed Producing (""PDP""), Proved (""1P""), 1P plus Probable (""2P"") and 2P plus Possible (""3P"").

Commenting on Gran Tierra's 2020 year-end reserves, operational update and future plans, Gary Guidry, President and Chief Executive Officer of Gran Tierra, said: ‚ÄúOur teams in Colombia, Ecuador and Canada rose to meet the many challenges of 2020 through their diligent management of COVID-19 safety protocols and sharp focus on maintaining and increasing the value of our assets. As a result, we are pleased to announce significant reserve additions in both the PDP and 1P categories, despite our large reductions in capital investment during 2020. This achievement demonstrates that the Company's core conventional oil assets continue to show positive waterflood responses and low base decline rates.

The advancement of our waterflooding efforts in the Acordionero, Costayaco and Moqueta oil fields has clearly allowed Gran Tierra to continue to convert Probable and Possible reserves into the Proved reserves categories. Even though we decided during 2020 to reduce capital spending, we believe the Company's excellent performance in terms of PDP and 1P reserves additions is a testament to the quality of our assets.

With our strategy, we believe Gran Tierra is well-positioned for the resumption of prudent growth in 2021 and strong potential free cash flow1 generation. We have already increased production approximately 24% from our third quarter 2020 average, which we believe reflects the strength of our Proved reserves. Our 2021 capital budget of $130 to $150 million is a balanced, returns-focused program which prioritizes free cash flow generation over the rate of development, exploration and production growth, with investment primarily directed to the Acordionero and Costayaco oil fields. With a keen focus on further strengthening our balance sheet, we plan to direct free cash flow to ongoing debt reduction in 2021 and beyond.

During fourth quarter 2020, Gran Tierra resumed development activities throughout our portfolio, including the ongoing well workover operations and the restart of development drilling at Acordionero. We also restarted workover operations at Costayaco and look forward to a planned initiation of development drilling in that field during second quarter 2021. We forecast 2021 average production of 28,000 to 30,000 bopd for the Company.

Our 2021 plans are fully aligned with Gran Tierra's ""Beyond Compliance Policy"" which focuses on our commitments to environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") excellence. Gran Tierra looks for significant opportunities and benefits to the environment and communities by voluntarily and proactively taking steps to protect the environment and provide social benefits because it is the right thing to do. In 2020, we also had our best safety year in the history of the Company.

We believe that Gran Tierra successfully navigated the exceptional challenges of 2020 and are excited to return to an economically sound growth trajectory in 2021 and beyond, with a focus on free cash flow generation and debt reduction.""


-> During 2020, Gran Tierra achieved:
Material PDP and 1P reserves additions, in particular at Acordionero, Costayaco and Moqueta, as a result of ongoing successful waterflooding operations

PDP reserves replacement of 133% with PDP reserves additions of 11.0 MMBOE
1P reserves replacement of 100% with 1P reserves additions of 8.3 MMBOE

Finding and development costs (""F&D"") including future development costs (""FDC"") of $5.06/boe on a PDP basis and $2.65/boe on a 1P basis
F&D recycle ratios including FDC of 3.5 times (PDP) and 6.7 times (1P)

Significant reserves additions at Acordionero: 7.1 MMBOE (PDP) and 2.6 MMBOE (1P)
Despite a material reduction in the McDaniel's forecast oil price assumptions relative to one year ago (the average Brent oil price over the next 5 years in the GTE McDaniel Reserves Report is $54.04/bbl):
Gran Tierra's 2020 year-end 1P NPV10 after tax decreased only 21% compared to 2019 year-end
This performance was achieved in part due to large reductions in forecast operating costs based on the actual savings achieved by the Company in 2020
As of December 31, 2020, McDaniel estimates that Gran Tierra's total 1P undiscounted operating costs over the remaining life of the Company's fields are approximately 26% less than the McDaniel estimate as of December 31, 2019*

Acordionero, Costayaco, Moqueta and Suroriente now represent 83% of Gran Tierra's 1P reserves and 78% of 2P reserves

PDP reserves account for 55% of 1P reserves and 1P reserves account for 59% of 2P reserves, demonstrating the strength of the Company's reserves base and the potential future conversion of Probable reserves into 1P reserves and Proved Undeveloped reserves into PDP reserves

Gran Tierra's mature waterflood assets, Costayaco and Moqueta, continued to grow and deliver value, with total reserves additions of 3.8 MMBOE (PDP) and 5.5 MMBOE (1P)

FDC are forecast to be $312 million for 1P reserves and $565 million for 2P reserves

With the early finish to the studies, Atossa is hoping to fast forward the development of its treatment, Endoxifen.

Gran Tierra Energy Inc, a company focused on oil exploration and production in Colombia and Ecuador, today announced the Company's 2020 year-end reserves as evaluated by the Company's independent qualified reserves evaluator McDaniel & Associates Consultants Ltd. (""McDaniel"") in a report with an effective date of December 31, 2020 (the ""GTE McDaniel Reserves Report"") and an operational update.

All dollar amounts are in United States (""U.S."") dollars and all reserves and production volumes are on a working interest before royalties (""WI"") basis. Production is expressed in barrels (""bbl"") of oil per day (""bopd"") or bbl of oil equivalent (""boe"") per day (""boepd""), while reserves are expressed in bbl, boe or million boe (""MMBOE""), unless otherwise indicated. All reserves values, future net revenue and ancillary information contained in this press release have been prepared by McDaniel and calculated in compliance with Canadian National Instrument 51-101 ‚Äì Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities (‚ÄúNI 51-101‚Äù) and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (""COGEH"") and derived from the GTE McDaniel Reserves Report, unless otherwise expressly stated. The following reserves categories are discussed in this press release: Proved Developed Producing (""PDP""), Proved (""1P""), 1P plus Probable (""2P"") and 2P plus Possible (""3P"").

Commenting on Gran Tierra's 2020 year-end reserves, operational update and future plans, Gary Guidry, President and Chief Executive Officer of Gran Tierra, said: ‚ÄúOur teams in Colombia, Ecuador and Canada rose to meet the many challenges of 2020 through their diligent management of COVID-19 safety protocols and sharp focus on maintaining and increasing the value of our assets. As a result, we are pleased to announce significant reserve additions in both the PDP and 1P categories, despite our large reductions in capital investment during 2020. This achievement demonstrates that the Company's core conventional oil assets continue to show positive waterflood responses and low base decline rates.

The advancement of our waterflooding efforts in the Acordionero, Costayaco and Moqueta oil fields has clearly allowed Gran Tierra to continue to convert Probable and Possible reserves into the Proved reserves categories. Even though we decided during 2020 to reduce capital spending, we believe the Company's excellent performance in terms of PDP and 1P reserves additions is a testament to the quality of our assets.

With our strategy, we believe Gran Tierra is well-positioned for the resumption of prudent growth in 2021 and strong potential free cash flow1 generation. We have already increased production approximately 24% from our third quarter 2020 average, which we believe reflects the strength of our Proved reserves. Our 2021 capital budget of $130 to $150 million is a balanced, returns-focused program which prioritizes free cash flow generation over the rate of development, exploration and production growth, with investment primarily directed to the Acordionero and Costayaco oil fields. With a keen focus on further strengthening our balance sheet, we plan to direct free cash flow to ongoing debt reduction in 2021 and beyond.

During fourth quarter 2020, Gran Tierra resumed development activities throughout our portfolio, including the ongoing well workover operations and the restart of development drilling at Acordionero. We also restarted workover operations at Costayaco and look forward to a planned initiation of development drilling in that field during second quarter 2021. We forecast 2021 average production of 28,000 to 30,000 bopd for the Company.

Our 2021 plans are fully aligned with Gran Tierra's ""Beyond Compliance Policy"" which focuses on our commitments to environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") excellence. Gran Tierra looks for significant opportunities and benefits to the environment and communities by voluntarily and proactively taking steps to protect the environment and provide social benefits because it is the right thing to do. In 2020, we also had our best safety year in the history of the Company.

We believe that Gran Tierra successfully navigated the exceptional challenges of 2020 and are excited to return to an economically sound growth trajectory in 2021 and beyond, with a focus on free cash flow generation and debt reduction.""


-> During 2020, Gran Tierra achieved:
Material PDP and 1P reserves additions, in particular at Acordionero, Costayaco and Moqueta, as a result of ongoing successful waterflooding operations

PDP reserves replacement of 133% with PDP reserves additions of 11.0 MMBOE
1P reserves replacement of 100% with 1P reserves additions of 8.3 MMBOE

Finding and development costs (""F&D"") including future development costs (""FDC"") of $5.06/boe on a PDP basis and $2.65/boe on a 1P basis
F&D recycle ratios including FDC of 3.5 times (PDP) and 6.7 times (1P)

Significant reserves additions at Acordionero: 7.1 MMBOE (PDP) and 2.6 MMBOE (1P)
Despite a material reduction in the McDaniel's forecast oil price assumptions relative to one year ago (the average Brent oil price over the next 5 years in the GTE McDaniel Reserves Report is $54.04/bbl):
Gran Tierra's 2020 year-end 1P NPV10 after tax decreased only 21% compared to 2019 year-end
This performance was achieved in part due to large reductions in forecast operating costs based on the actual savings achieved by the Company in 2020
As of December 31, 2020, McDaniel estimates that Gran Tierra's total 1P undiscounted operating costs over the remaining life of the Company's fields are approximately 26% less than the McDaniel estimate as of December 31, 2019*

Acordionero, Costayaco, Moqueta and Suroriente now represent 83% of Gran Tierra's 1P reserves and 78% of 2P reserves

PDP reserves account for 55% of 1P reserves and 1P reserves account for 59% of 2P reserves, demonstrating the strength of the Company's reserves base and the potential future conversion of Probable reserves into 1P reserves and Proved Undeveloped reserves into PDP reserves

Gran Tierra's mature waterflood assets, Costayaco and Moqueta, continued to grow and deliver value, with total reserves additions of 3.8 MMBOE (PDP) and 5.5 MMBOE (1P)

FDC are forecast to be $312 million for 1P reserves and $565 million for 2P reserves

One is up 10 but another is down 10 it‚Äôs hard to grow. I get diversity but sometimes it‚Äôs too much IMO.
