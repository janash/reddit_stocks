**The most important step that you can take is always the next one.** 

**4:00 Update**

Dear Hedge Funds,

Today, people owning more than 49,000,000 shares agree that the value of GME is at least $183. That represents more than 116% of the current float.

Close your fucking shorts.

We'll talk again tomorrow.

Current price: 183.26

**3:25 Update**

Maybe no 200 today. That's fine. GME made such amazing progress today which could continue tomorrow as well. We haven't seen any ability from the HFs to slow this growth. GME is so fucking strong.

Current price: 181.80

**3:20 Update**

It might hit 200. It would be so fucking huge if GME ends above 200. 40 minutes left, and I still feel like there's a small possible chance.

Current price: 180.21


**3:00 Update**

Seriously. If GME hits 200, the situation would literally have been -

Everyone: GME is worth at least 200

Earnings Report

HF: GME is worth less than 120

Everyone: Fuck that, it's worth at least 200

How the fuck do the HFs react to that?

Current price: 182.42

**2:55 Update**

GME wanted power hour to start early. If GME hits 200, it would cement GMEs price legitimacy there, and I have no idea how the HFs would be able to convince anyone that it's not worth at least that. This is an absolute monster of a day for GME

Holy fuck.

Current price: 182.11

**2:46 Update**

I know when I made a typo when I saw my messages blow up. Please forgive me. I do all of this on my phone at work and most of these updates are quick jots.

GME might be starting a move up?. Power hour coming up. Moonshot needs some stupid stuff to happen in order for it to even be possible.

Current price: 171.00

**2:25 Update**

GME is still stalled at 265. There's about a $5 volatility swing which makes sense after the past two days. Volume has been relatively low.

Volume: 39,000,000

Current price: 164

**1:54 Update**

I have this weird feeling that there's going to be another large swing before the end of the day. The volume velocity has slowed drastically since this morning. Will see see another volume spike at power hour?

Regardless, tomorrow is shaping up to be another huge battle. After everything they've done, I don't know if the HFs can afford losing the ITM call/put spread this week. If GME ends up above 200, their entire plan for this week would've been a huge failure.

Volume: 38,000,000

Current price: 161.95

**1:40 Update**

Forgive me for the messy data. I had to pull the info on my phone, put it in excel on my work computer, crunch the numbers, take a picture on my phone, go outside to upload on mobile data, then update before I had to get back from lunch.

The green marks are the price points I'm looking at as significant milestones.

I'm trying really hard to make sure I don't get fired.

Current price: 169.28

**1:36 Update**

Volume is currently at around 36,000,000. GME broke 170 again. It doesn't really move without volume, but once the volume is there, the price flies up.

How much more volume will we get? We'll find out.

Volume: 36,000,000

Current price: 173.27

**1:20 Update**

Sorry y'all. I was doing math. [Here is the current options picture.](https://imgur.com/gallery/DQAsPUD) The balance point was actually 160, which GME has crossed. The next big step is 200, where the total ITM number jumps. As you see, the further GME goes, the more the call options pile on. If there's another huge jump before the end of the day, the Moonshot is still possible.

As long as GME ends above 160 tomorrow, the calls will outweigh the puts which will continue to drive buying power into next week.

Current price: 167.35



**12:30 Update**

GME has stalled because volume has stalled. We haven't seen a lunchtime bump. I'm assuming that it's probably not going to happen at this point. As y'all can see, GME is still to far away for the pendulum to swing on its own. I would anticipate at least one more major move before the day is over. The Moonshot is still possible, but it would need a few more pushes like we had this morning. If this kind of momentum continues through tomorrow though, GME could get back above 200 by the end of the week.

A lot of stuff can still happen.

Volume: 30,000,000

Current price: 155.87

**12:04 Update**

GME has hit it's first major stall. Lunch time is starting for the east coast so we'll see if things pick back up. I'm really impressed with what's happened so far today. Even if it ends in this area, it would be a great response to yesterday.

Volume: 27,800,000

Current price: 158.03

**11:35 Update**

We broke yesterday's volume.

What if people go to lunch, see the price, and FOMO in? Today's gone perfectly for GME so far, and that would be GMEs most hilarious next step.

Volume: 23,000,000

Current price: 164.25

**11:28 Update**

I took a precautionary shit. Thank God because I come back to see GME break 170. We've almost broken yesterday's volume only two hours into the day.

Holy fucking shit GME is strong.

Current price: 170.23

**11:21 Update**

GME broke 165. GME is so fucking strong right now. I'm getting Goku going Super Saiyan vibes right now.

Holy fuck

Volume: 18,000,000

Price: 165.32

**11:11 Update**

Y'all. Volume is at 16,000,000. GME broke 150 and is halfway to 190. It's currently on pace to barely hit 60,000,000 by the end of the day. The Pendulum Moonshot is still most likely not going to happen, but I still can't rule it out of the realm of possibilities. This kind of pace needs to continue for the rest of the day in order for it to MAYBE happen. 

Current price: 153.99

**10:56 Update**

Volume is already at 12 million. GME continues to push up when volume goes up.

As far as my theory is concerned, GME needs AT LEAST 60,000,000 volume if not more for GME to be on pace to do this. I don't know if volume will stay strong. As of now though, I still haven't ruled it out as impossible.

Current price; 145.20


**10:44 Update**

Just to clarify, my theory is not a prediction, I'm just saying that I can see it as a possibility if everything lines up. I'm order for this to happen, it will probably take all of the day today and tomorrow to fully materialize.

Right now, I still see it as a very small possibility. I'll literally shit myself at my desk and quit my job if that happens.

Current price: 141.86

**10:26 Update**

This is theoretical and may contain many assumptions that may be wrong. I am not predicting anything. Over lunch I'm going to do some math to be more exact, but last I checked, the total ITM Call put spread balance point was 190. That's where the Call ITM percentage swing changes from negative to positive. If today becomes a massive day, we would potentially see the pendulum swing accelerate towards 190. If that acceleration does happen, the total ITM options expands as you go beyond 200. So like a pendulum, it should accelerate, but once it crosses the 190 threshold, the gravity of growing calls should continue pulling GME up. 

Please don't excited, this probably won't happen, but it is definitely a possibility.

Current price: 138.22

GME wanted power hour to start early. If GME hits 200, it would cement GMEs price legitimacy there, and I have no idea how the HFs would be able to convince anyone that it's not worth at least that. This is an absolute monster of a day for GME

Holy fuck.

Current price: 182.11

**2:46 Update**

I know when I made a typo when I saw my messages blow up. Please forgive me. I do all of this on my phone at work and most of these updates are quick jots.

GME might be starting a move up?. Power hour coming up. Moonshot needs some stupid stuff to happen in order for it to even be possible.

Current price: 171.00

**2:25 Update**

GME is still stalled at 265. There's about a $5 volatility swing which makes sense after the past two days. Volume has been relatively low.

Volume: 39,000,000

Current price: 164

**1:54 Update**

I have this weird feeling that there's going to be another large swing before the end of the day. The volume velocity has slowed drastically since this morning. Will see see another volume spike at power hour?

Regardless, tomorrow is shaping up to be another huge battle. After everything they've done, I don't know if the HFs can afford losing the ITM call/put spread this week. If GME ends up above 200, their entire plan for this week would've been a huge failure.

Volume: 38,000,000

Current price: 161.95

**1:40 Update**

Forgive me for the messy data. I had to pull the info on my phone, put it in excel on my work computer, crunch the numbers, take a picture on my phone, go outside to upload on mobile data, then update before I had to get back from lunch.

The green marks are the price points I'm looking at as significant milestones.

I'm trying really hard to make sure I don't get fired.

Current price: 169.28

**1:36 Update**

Volume is currently at around 36,000,000. GME broke 170 again. It doesn't really move without volume, but once the volume is there, the price flies up.

How much more volume will we get? We'll find out.

Volume: 36,000,000

Current price: 173.27

**1:20 Update**

Sorry y'all. I was doing math. [Here is the current options picture.](https://imgur.com/gallery/DQAsPUD) The balance point was actually 160, which GME has crossed. The next big step is 200, where the total ITM number jumps. As you see, the further GME goes, the more the call options pile on. If there's another huge jump before the end of the day, the Moonshot is still possible.

As long as GME ends above 160 tomorrow, the calls will outweigh the puts which will continue to drive buying power into next week.

Current price: 167.35



**12:30 Update**

GME has stalled because volume has stalled. We haven't seen a lunchtime bump. I'm assuming that it's probably not going to happen at this point. As y'all can see, GME is still to far away for the pendulum to swing on its own. I would anticipate at least one more major move before the day is over. The Moonshot is still possible, but it would need a few more pushes like we had this morning. If this kind of momentum continues through tomorrow though, GME could get back above 200 by the end of the week.

A lot of stuff can still happen.

Volume: 30,000,000

Current price: 155.87

**12:04 Update**

GME has hit it's first major stall. Lunch time is starting for the east coast so we'll see if things pick back up. I'm really impressed with what's happened so far today. Even if it ends in this area, it would be a great response to yesterday.

Volume: 27,800,000

Current price: 158.03

**11:35 Update**

We broke yesterday's volume.

What if people go to lunch, see the price, and FOMO in? Today's gone perfectly for GME so far, and that would be GMEs most hilarious next step.

Volume: 23,000,000

Current price: 164.25

**11:28 Update**

I took a precautionary shit. Thank God because I come back to see GME break 170. We've almost broken yesterday's volume only two hours into the day.

Holy fucking shit GME is strong.

Current price: 170.23

**11:21 Update**

GME broke 165. GME is so fucking strong right now. I'm getting Goku going Super Saiyan vibes right now.

Holy fuck

Volume: 18,000,000

Price: 165.32

**11:11 Update**

Y'all. Volume is at 16,000,000. GME broke 150 and is halfway to 190. It's currently on pace to barely hit 60,000,000 by the end of the day. The Pendulum Moonshot is still most likely not going to happen, but I still can't rule it out of the realm of possibilities. This kind of pace needs to continue for the rest of the day in order for it to MAYBE happen. 

Current price: 153.99

**10:56 Update**

Volume is already at 12 million. GME continues to push up when volume goes up.

As far as my theory is concerned, GME needs AT LEAST 60,000,000 volume if not more for GME to be on pace to do this. I don't know if volume will stay strong. As of now though, I still haven't ruled it out as impossible.

Current price; 145.20


**10:44 Update**

Just to clarify, my theory is not a prediction, I'm just saying that I can see it as a possibility if everything lines up. I'm order for this to happen, it will probably take all of the day today and tomorrow to fully materialize.

Right now, I still see it as a very small possibility. I'll literally shit myself at my desk and quit my job if that happens.

Current price: 141.86

**10:26 Update**

This is theoretical and may contain many assumptions that may be wrong. I am not predicting anything. Over lunch I'm going to do some math to be more exact, but last I checked, the total ITM Call put spread balance point was 190. That's where the Call ITM percentage swing changes from negative to positive. If today becomes a massive day, we would potentially see the pendulum swing accelerate towards 190. If that acceleration does happen, the total ITM options expands as you go beyond 200. So like a pendulum, it should accelerate, but once it crosses the 190 threshold, the gravity of growing calls should continue pulling GME up. 

Please don't excited, this probably won't happen, but it is definitely a possibility.

Current price: 138.22

110,GME," welp -- just something to consider: with the exception of a few of you out there, I reckon most of us don't have anything significant to lose with GME.

You see, $1000 -- $10,000, that's the price of lunch to a some of the hedge fund managers. But it's potentially life altering to some of us. We can get there pretty easily with what we have in GME -- and if we lose our ass, well, we're out some months of money. We just don't have as much on the line, individually, as a hedge fund -- a singular entity -- that's on the hook for $100 million or more if things don't go their way.

We have nothing to lose and everything to gain. A few (even a few dozen) share's worth of money isn't going to make or break anyone -- but multiplied by the number of apes there are, and the limited risk of bankruptcy or disaster we all have, well -- they're well and truly fucked ~~if~~ ***when*** this goes our way.

282,GME," Shout out to /u/berto0311 (and probably many others) for pointing out that this DTCC notice also needs to be read alongside the SR-NSCC-2021-801 filing.  Reading the bullshit they put in these documents is excruciatingly boring, but essentially the two filings work together to theoretically improve transparency and put member institutions on the hook for financial risks by enabling the DTCC/NSCC to have more ""teeth"" to enforce liquidity requirements.

In support of the ape community's joy over these filings, the following quote is taken from the 801 document - ""While the monthly expiration of stock options does present larger liquidity exposures to NSCC, NSCC may also face large liquidity exposures from Members' daily activity, particularly during volatile market conditions.""

However, my *opinion* is that we need hold off reeeing for two reasons:

1 - The timing of these rule changes coming into effect is unclear.  There are various dates in the filings, but 801 appears to have been published in the federal register today.  My understanding is that is generally the ""formal notice"" date, and may take any where from 10 to 60 days from today (or longer) to come into force.  I don't see any obviously hedgie comments/objections on the agency's site, but those may still be en route.

2 - The proposed change to Rule 4(A) modifies the NSCC's Rulesto allow them to ""... calculate and collect, **when applicable**, supplemental liquidity deposits... on a daily basis...""  The fact that this statement includes ""when applicable"" implies that there is a subjective determination of when the SLDs will, in fact, be collected daily.  I'm hoping they consider the dark pool data from FINRA and realize Citadel better fucking pay SLDs hourly, but it's the government, so who the fuck knows when they'll actually enforce this.

**TLDR**: Uncle Sam seems to be taking his geriatric time to save apes, if he even comes.   

So as always, HODL, and hope that we get some lively news and/or other catalysts from GME to blast us to the moon.  Peace and tendies!

283,GME," I think this is why witching day & earnings day took such a hit. The long whales withdrew their positions from the buy book to drive down prices to scoop up before it rises.


The level 2 data has showed 170k shares/$$75M in the buy book. Last few trading days it hasn't risen above 70k shares while the hedges lost about 30k shares. I've yet to see their bid side above 80k shares even at their hardest attack on the price


Honestly, it feels like the end game now. 2nd wave of FOMOers were paper handed with the price drop since most spent their stimulus money on shares.


There's no way we went from 80k daily volume to 15k at best. I can't even imagine how much it would have costed to cover their original shorts even if 80% were at $20 after the price surge.


No one knows how many shares, synthetic or otherwise are out there, but it's more than 100% and retail purchases a large portion in the first few weeks.


All I'm waiting for is a gamma to push this into a SS. Their 10k filing had incredibly specific CYA language and GameStop doesn't want to have any reason to point the blame at them, but a transition into EComm, old execs leaving with the new woman coming on board + a succinct 15min call with no questions.


Nothings changed on the shorter's positions, only the current price. If MarketWatch published a story about the price fall before it happened just a few days ago, it just reinforces that they want people to panic sell with pushing a media narrative.


If they were safe, GME would just be left alone and forgotten to the bag holders.

516,GME," Must read. Copy pasta. Not confirmation bias but fact

I can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre still doing this. short sales in dark pools are the ONLY shorts reported by FINRA daily my understanding is some scammer on YouTube came up with this latest ‚Äútheory‚Äù? Get a clue

INTERPRETING DAILY FINRA SHORT SALE REPORTS

I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts about FINRA daily short sale reports and what it means. Importantly it doesn‚Äôt mean what you think. This isn‚Äôt FUD it‚Äôs just how market making works.

TL;DR a lot of the short volume is market makers shorting to facilitate buy orders and they immediately cover with the next trade.

-High short volume in the FINRA report actually often reflects net BUYING. This is why trying to interpret these reports is pretty much useless.

-That sounds crazy but that‚Äôs how market making works. -FINRA report is only for off exchange trades (dark pools). It‚Äôs a myth that dark pools are all institutional, your retail broker is sending trades to dark pools like Citadel, Virtu, etc.

-A MM makes money on the spread between buying and selling (obviously). What happens is - your order to buy 100 shares of GME at market gets sent to a dark pool. The MM (a computer) SHORTS you those shares at $108.793 and then BUYS those shares back at $108.791. A short of 100 shares is recorded. This also explains how you see ridiculous volumes and ridiculous # of shorts every day for a stock that has a 50M float. The MM isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgoing short‚Äù GME. They short it for a millisecond then buy a fraction of a penny lower a millisecond later.

-So high short volume in the FINRA report (which is ONLY reflecting off exchange trades (dark pools) does NOT necessarily reflect high levels of actual shorting. It often reflects high levels of buying! Um. Like we just saw this week. Repeat that It does also does NOT reflect exchange trades.

You don‚Äôt have to believe me you can read this super interesting piece here. Generally speaking, the idea that large short volume in the report is good news for holders seems true! It‚Äôs just not for the reasons you think.

525,TD," I'm considered an institutional investor(insert hedgie calls here), I manage client money in individual accounts.  I can block trade accounts to increase the buying power of those clients when buying securities I want in everyone's account.  Sometimes, on a thinly traded security, I generate an order that's large enough on its own to move the price of the stock.  That's not in anyone's best interest, particularly if I'm just shuffling my allocations around on a rebalance and I'm not dumping something due to actual market reasons.  So instead of submitting the order standard and having the order routed to either an exchange or market maker directly for best execution, I ask TD Ameritrade to go solicit me bids or asks for the order in a dark pool.  

I could alternatively use an algorithm to chop the order and spread the submission out, but I will categorically get a better execution price by asking market makers directly to make me an offer.  Thus dark pools, to avoid moving prices on stupidly large buys and sells.  When a mutual fund sells a position, if it submitted that order on an exchange it could move the price of Apple a not-insignificant amount.

The car has an MSRP, regardless of what happens between manufacturers and dealers/distributors. In the stock market, the value is based on sales that happen ON THE MARKET. When you bypass this, you are given an advantage to manipulate the price of a stock.

Nobody's going behind the scenes and buying up all of the Honda Accords to create their own artificial price for that econobox. If some trading of Accords went on behind the scenes to manipulate the price/scarcity, etc, nobody is going to pay $85,000 for the Accord. Your 1 month old Accord won't suddenly be worth $62,000 at CarMax or on Craigslist.

548,BIG," (This is about to sound like an advertising pitch but I swear I'm just answering your question.)

If you're just concerned with knowledge, and aren't really worried about certification, udemy.com has a lot of good courses on the subject. Their certificates are widely considered to be garbage so if you want certification look elsewhere but if you just want knowledge they've got it.

They have sales all the time, so don't take this as pressure, (time pressure is how companies get you to pay more than you otherwise would, so don't rush into this, THEY HAVE SALES THIS BIG ALL THE TIME,) but there's a sale on for like 15 more hours right now actually, most courses down to between 12-20 bucks, as compared to 100-200.

Also, do be warned, udemy is not who you're getting your courses from. They're a service that connects you with teachers. There are plenty of GREAT courses for GREAT value, but there's also plenty of scams, so watch out for that. They have a 30 day money back guarantee on most courses (maybe all? not sure) if you get scammed or just decide the course isn't for you, but it's always better to just do your research on a course before you buy.

(Do also note some courses will not go on sale - usually very advanced courses for whom the original price is already more than fair, or scams.)

I've been taking classes on technical analysis, data science, and python for both data analysis and algorithms. I've got courses lined up in statistics and quantitative finance too, but I need calculus for quant finance and I'm refreshing my high-school maths before I try to go into that.

You do need to be self-motivated though. You won't have a teacher to grade you or make you keep working.You'll have videos to watch, and if the class is good you'll have workbooks and answer sheets to check your work, or projects to do, and that's it. And you can ask the teacher for help, but depending on the course you may have mixed results getting responses. But if you *are* self-motivated, it's a fantastic resource. I've been to college and quit because it wasn't worth the money, and the *good* classes I've been taking on udemy are better than actual college for a whole lot fucking less.

(Watch out for scams, and if you end up buying a course that turns out to look scammy, don't hesitate to use that 30-day return policy.)",bestakroogen,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcpce6/finra_offers_publicly_available_information_on/gs6fn4c/,0.05,0.809,0.141,0.9924

Excellent, my shorts will make me so fucking rich. I keep doing this. The price is now $42 and I cover. I buy like a MF, ON MARKET. The price rises to $72, $88, I now start doing the opposite strategy, I take my customers' orders and buy ON MARKET to raise price and sell in the dark pool so as to not drop price. Shares are now trading at $133. I short the ever living fuck out of it again and dump all my shares on market, I start selling my customers' shares on market, and buying for customers from dark pool.

Essentially, Wallstreetbets is the exact opposite of a hedgefund. Where hedgefunds rely on short selling, wallstreetbets relies on short buying. I dont think anyone here has held a stock that had a similar boom like GME even close as long.

Once GME settles down long enough for people to sell most of their stocks to bet into other stocks again, is when this sub is truly going to show why r/investing and r/wallstreetbets are different.

721,JP," Ironically, JP Morgan would organize a private bailout of the banks 6 years later during the Bank Panic of 1907. As I understand it, when the government saw that private institutions like JP Morgan could bail out banking institutions, the government decided it shouldn't rely on private parties to bail out the banking system. I think that's when the US government decided it should take on the role of bailing out banks in a crash.

EDIT FOR SMOOTH BRAINS: 

Main takeaways from this are:

Main takeaways from this are: 

1. XRT an ETF holding loads of GME shorted at 277% (?!) that's huge and a good sign.

2. Individual/retail positions raised by 0.2% = buying that fucking dip and holding.

3. institutional & insider ownerships total 130%, meaning GME is still *HEAVILY* shorted with synthetic shorts.

781,IT," You don't understand, IT IS NOT ILLEGAL! 

""Illegal is a description for something that is in violation of statute, regulation or ordinance. Illegal does not necessarily mean criminal. Something may be illegal under a statute that doesn't require criminal intent, and is therefore a civil vilation subject to civil penalites such as a fine. Illegal acts that are civil violations include driving too fast, failure to register a business, etc.

Other statutes require criminal intent in order to declare something illegal, and such crimes are puishable by fines and/or imprisonment. Illegal acts that are criminal include bribery, rape, murder, theft, etc.""

It requires a punishment. If a hedge fund illegally shorts and creates counterfeit stock and is punished by a fine of some fraction of what they made from the scheme they were not punished:


Definition of punishment

1 : the act of punishing
2a : suffering, pain, or loss that serves as retribution
b : a penalty inflicted on an offender through judicial procedure
3 : severe, rough, or disastrous treatment


So, tell me how, if you make, say 10M off a scheme and are punished anywhere from 0$ to, say, 9M$ how that is a punishment?

""The former Notre Dame walk-on has agreed to pay $382,866 to resolve the SEC‚Äôs claim that he participated in a pump-and-dump, fraudulently inducing investors to bid up the stock of his sports drink company, Rudy Nutrition. He did not admit or deny the allegations.

According to the SEC complaint filed in federal court in Las Vegas, Ruettiger‚Äôs company sold only a small amount of a sports drink called ‚ÄúRudy‚Äù and instead the company served as a vehicle for a 2008 pump-and-dump scheme that generated $11 million in illicit profits. The SEC revoked registration of the stock of Rudy Nutrition in 2008.""


So, he pays 382k but gets to keep nearly 11M(assuming it all went to him). Tell, me, how is that in any sense of the meaning of punishment is that a punishment. That is not even a slap on the wrist. That isn't even a scolding or time out. That is rewarding bad behavior, how is that a punishment?",EternalDissonance,-5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcinc1/bloomberg_terminal_latest_info_drop_look_at_that/gs46pq6/,0.179,0.735,0.086,-0.9871

""The past year saw Michael Jordan‚Äôs brand get another boost with the release of ‚ÄúThe Last Dance,‚Äù but it appears the Bulls legend didn‚Äôt do so well financially. While his net worth remains an eye-popping $1.6 billion, according to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/profile/michael-jordan/), that‚Äôs a $500 million drop since the publication last reported his net worth in April 2020.

It‚Äôs possible that such a large decline is related to the biggest Wall Street story of the year: [the GameStop stock saga](https://chicago.suntimes.com/business/2021/1/27/22252499/gamestop-stock-short-squeeze-price-amc).

Two years ago, Jordan ‚Äî the majority owner of the Hornets since 2010 ‚Äî sold a minority share of the Hornets to two investors. One of them was Gabe Plotkin, founder and chief investment officer of Melvin Capital, a hedge fund that required billions in additional cash after incurring major losses due to a short squeeze of GameStop stock by groups of retail investors.

Details of Jordan‚Äôs current business relationship with Plotkin and the other investor, Daniel Sundheim, aren‚Äôt publicly known, but his Airness said while announcing their deal in 2019 that their investment was ‚Äúinvaluable‚Äù as the Hornets ‚Äústrive to compete with the best in the NBA.‚Äù

&#x200B;

so essentially its a giant click bait bullshit article considering it has no real ties to his net worth because they own a minority share in the hornets. 

the article literally says the details arent publicly known.

INTERPRETING DAILY FINRA SHORT SALE REPORTS

I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts about FINRA daily short sale reports and what it means. Importantly it doesn‚Äôt mean what you think. This isn‚Äôt FUD it‚Äôs just how market making works.

TL;DR a lot of the short volume is market makers shorting to facilitate buy orders and they immediately cover with the next trade.

-High short volume in the FINRA report actually often reflects net BUYING. This is why trying to interpret these reports is pretty much useless.

-That sounds crazy but that‚Äôs how market making works. -FINRA report is only for off exchange trades (dark pools). It‚Äôs a myth that dark pools are all institutional, your retail broker is sending trades to dark pools like Citadel, Virtu, etc.

-A MM makes money on the spread between buying and selling (obviously). What happens is - your order to buy 100 shares of GME at market gets sent to a dark pool. The MM (a computer) SHORTS you those shares at $108.793 and then BUYS those shares back at $108.791. A short of 100 shares is recorded. This also explains how you see ridiculous volumes and ridiculous # of shorts every day for a stock that has a 50M float. The MM isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgoing short‚Äù GME. They short it for a millisecond then buy a fraction of a penny lower a millisecond later.

-So high short volume in the FINRA report (which is ONLY reflecting off exchange trades (dark pools) does NOT necessarily reflect high levels of actual shorting. Repeat that It does also does NOT reflect exchange trades. If you want exchange shorts you have to go to NYSE and NASDAQ and pay to download it through an FTP.

Sales recorded as shorts may also just be option hedging, algos/HFT that are all covering within seconds. 

You don‚Äôt have to believe me you can read this super interesting piece here.

1088,AMC," No, that is not correct. The option could be exercised at any time. It usually doesn't make sense to exercise early because it discards the time value of the option. But it can happen, and may make sense say for tax reasons around a dividend distribution.

Not clear to me if OP is buying or selling puts. Position is 115, guess that is long and OP is buying them. In that case OP doesn't have to worry about early exercise--it is their option and their choice to exercise it.

However if OP holds the put to expiry and it is in the money, depends on your broker, but they will exercise the option and you will sell shares leaving you with a short position (over the weekend!) with the risk that your potential loss is unbounded as the share price moves up.

But it is AMC, so it's not gonna move up. (Note: I am long AMC.)",dominiccooney,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mco1hm/so_i_discovered_puts_today/gs61piu/,0.064,0.881,0.055,-0.1484

1092,AMC," Forcing the seller to cough up dough and take shares.

Put = option to sell, promise to buy. So if OP sells puts--makes a promise to buy at the strike price any time up to expiration--and the option is exercised, they have to cough up strike price * contract size. And they get ""contract size"" shares.

So say OP sold 115 puts with a $10 strike. The contract size for AMC is 100. They have promised to pay $115,000 and take 11,500 AMC shares.

But looks like they have bought puts. As long as they sell to close, yes, the most they can lose is everything they paid for the puts.",dominiccooney,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mco1hm/so_i_discovered_puts_today/gs6dvlm/,0.073,0.772,0.155,0.8761

1146,RKT," Honestly, I think the shorting is happening due to so many people buying calls, it's free money if you sell calls then bring the price down to allow the calls to expire OTM. Which means it won't pop until they've made enough money off premiums to still come out ahead with a net profit after covering their short positions. Or when there is a huge buying catalyst and the risk becomes too high, i.e the dividend last time. Wall Street is full of greed, so I find it hard to believe they would slow down anytime soon on the shorting and selling contracts. I believe the best chance of RKT seeing it's proper share price is most likely after one of the next couple earnings, with the combination of having most sources only counting the last two quarters in their valuation of RKT and RKT blowing the next two earnings out of the water, it's possible that this sleeping giant of a stock will finally be woken.",TreeImmediate,22,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcik9i/position_cost_distribution_shows_rkts_stock_is/gs45yd0/,0.036,0.841,0.122,0.9364

Due to this, they aren‚Äôt eligible for inclusion until June which is the Russell reconstitution month. They will rank companies in May and end of June will be inclusion if they make it.

1395,UWMC," They actually have a pretty nice moat with their self-developed technology to close loans faster than anyone else, and almost 3 times faster than Rocket. During his interview with Cramer, Ishbia even said that fewer than 500 out of over 12,000 brokers chose to stick with Rocket rather than UWMC. He did kind of stutter a bit and look stupid at times but the numbers should speak for themselves.

According to their 10-K, they have $425M net assets. Even if nothing else, the shares would be worth $4.70 each just for selling everything the company owns. Right now the shares are only asking for an extra $3 to have access to $3+ billion dollars in revenue. On top of that, they could pay the dividend for YEARS if they didn't make a single penny more.

The insider-held shares are also locked up for 180 days after IPO, so it'll be July-ish before any of the other 94% of shares out there hit the market.  There is squeeze potential knowing that it can be challenging for shorts to cover but that's not even the main play here. Once this company starts getting analyst coverage, it'll bump nicely.

According to [Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UWMC/options?date=1637280000&p=UWMC&straddle=true) May has some pretty serious open interest - strikes between 9 and 15 have about 120,000 calls, meaning 12 million shares (out of 90 million float) could need to be bought to hedge.

How many of those have already been bought, I do not know, but added to the short interest there is a real possibility of a squeeze. I would be cautious though, as this is not to say it will happen, and if it does it is unlikely to send the stock much higher than $15 (when the vast majority of the contracts have been covered), and very unlikely to go past the highest strike of $25 - and it would of course rapidly collapse thenceforth.",democritusparadise,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcsq6x/uwmc_why_its_the_play_short_volume_russell_index/gs784yj/,0.077,0.851,0.071,0.0387

Anything below 8 is a steal, and its dirt cheap right now. Wait for earnings or increased volume over time as this company keeps gobbling up market share. In the meantime rates will stay low and even if they go up,  they're still relatively low compared to the last decade. Russel inclusion may be down the road.

It's really hard to go wrong with this stonk. Just buy it HODL, collect dividends, re evaluate some time in the double digits.

***INTERPRETING DAILY FINRA SHORT SALE REPORTS***

I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts about FINRA daily short sale reports and what it means. Importantly it doesn‚Äôt mean what you think. This isn‚Äôt FUD it‚Äôs just how market making works.

TL;DR a lot of the short volume is market makers shorting to facilitate *buy* orders and they immediately cover with the next trade. 

-High short volume in the FINRA report actually often reflects net BUYING. This is why trying to interpret these reports is pretty much useless. 

-That sounds crazy but that‚Äôs how market making works. 
-FINRA report is only for off exchange trades (dark pools). It‚Äôs a myth that dark pools are all institutional, your retail broker is sending trades to dark pools like Citadel, Virtu, etc. 

-A MM makes money on the spread between buying and selling (obviously). 
What happens is - your order to buy 100 shares of GME at market gets sent to a dark pool. The MM (a computer) SHORTS you those shares at $108.793 and then BUYS those shares back at $108.791. A short of 100 shares is recorded. This also explains how you see ridiculous volumes and ridiculous # of shorts every day for a stock that has a 50M float. The MM isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgoing short‚Äù GME. They short it for a millisecond then buy a fraction of a penny lower a millisecond later.

-So high short volume in the FINRA report (which is ONLY reflecting off exchange trades (dark pools) does NOT necessarily reflect high levels of actual shorting. Repeat that It does also does NOT reflect exchange trades. If you want exchange shorts you have to go to NYSE and NASDAQ and pay to download it through an FTP. 

You don‚Äôt have to believe me you can read this super interesting piece here. Generally speaking, the idea that large short volume in the report is good news for holders seems true! It‚Äôs just not for the reasons you think.
