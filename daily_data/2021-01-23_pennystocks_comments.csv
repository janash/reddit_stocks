In other words, they‚Äôd keep the difference of $39 per share they borrowed. That‚Äôs what short selling is, and that‚Äôs how they make profit. HOWEVER, people saw this opportunity and bought the stocks, which raised the price and prevented the investment firms from buying back at a lower price to make profit. The key thing here is that the brokers are charging interest on the stocks that were borrowed, so the longer we hold our shares and keep the price up, the more interest the borrowed stocks are accruing.

Next time you see a stock make a move and end in what you think is a random place, draw a line where it stops on your graph. 
Cycle though some time frames, plot the common SMAs and you will see what acted as resistance.

For the ATR it does change on different timeframes.
Your trade shouldn't be random though, you will be trading a time frame. So you can use that time frame.

I trade the daily and 5m chart so I track ATR on these timeframes.
But actually you don't need to use the ATR itself, you can eyeball it if you like.
The point is that if you set your Stop at exactly support then there's a high chance of it being touched and tested; stopping you out. ATR just gives you an actual value to work with.",0.051,0.87,0.079,0.6537

Acquisition with PKG 

Cerebain Biotech reported it is in the final stages of its acquisition of PKG, Inc. A privately-owned contract manufacturing and engineering company developing high-end medical and aerospace equipment. PKG was doing millions in revenues before covid hit and was a major contributor in designing and manufacturing numerous and diverse devices for Fortune 500 companies, mid-size organizations, and start-up businesses. Recently PKG reported their registration with the FDA as an establishment producing medical personal protection equipment (PPE), such as surgical masks and clear masks. In 2010, PKG became the first company to develop the touch display device used in medical devices for ultrasound imaging, and received an award from the Idaho Technology Council for Most Innovative Company.

To meet the rigorous controls necessary for FDA-cleared products, ClearMask LLC and Xometry, the largest marketplace for On-Demand manufacturing, partnered with PKG Inc, an ISO 13485-certified facility, to manufacture the FDA-cleared version of the ClearMask‚Ñ¢.

To meet the rigorous controls necessary for FDA-cleared products, ClearMask LLC and Xometry, the largest marketplace for On-Demand manufacturing, partnered with PKG Inc, an ISO 13485-certified facility, to manufacture the FDA-cleared version of the ClearMask‚Ñ¢. 

Back in 2017 Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ:IMMR), the leading developer and licensor of touch feedback technology,  announced that it has renewed a license agreement with PKG, Inc. who‚Äôs goal is to enable touch everywhere in the digital world.

126,PKG,"CBBT IS very exciting; 

Check this out - Development-stage medical device company focused on the creation and clinical development of a minimally invasive implantable device. The device leverages the clinically observable, positive impact that omentum stimulation has on cognitive function as related to dementias, and in particular, Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.

Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. 
 5 million Us citizens live with Alzheimer‚Äôs, it‚Äôs 6th leader cause of death, 1 in 3 seniors die with Alzheimer‚Äôs or another dementia. 50% of primary care physicians believe the medical profession is not ready for the growing number of people with Alzheimer‚Äôs. By 2050 more than 13 million Americans over 65 could be living with Alzheimer‚Äôs unless scientists develop new approaches to prevent or cure it. 

Every 65 seconds, someone in America develops Alzheimer's. Worldwide, at least 50 million people are believed to be living with Alzheimer's disease or other dementias. According to the United Nations, that is more than the population of Columbia. 

Bill Gates has been globally recognised in helping fight the Alzheimer‚Äôs disease! 

If breakthroughs are not discovered, rates could exceed 152 million by 2050. Worldwide dementia care is estimated to cost upwards of US$1 trillion. Alzheimer's is projected to cripple America's healthcare system. Total payments for health care, long-term care, and hospice for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are projected to increase from $290 billion in 2018 to more than $1.1 trillion in 2050 

Acquisition with PKG 

Cerebain Biotech reported it is in the final stages of its acquisition of PKG, Inc. A privately-owned contract manufacturing and engineering company developing high-end medical and aerospace equipment. PKG was doing millions in revenues before covid hit and was a major contributor in designing and manufacturing numerous and diverse devices for Fortune 500 companies, mid-size organizations, and start-up businesses. Recently PKG reported their registration with the FDA as an establishment producing medical personal protection equipment (PPE), such as surgical masks and clear masks. In 2010, PKG became the first company to develop the touch display device used in medical devices for ultrasound imaging, and received an award from the Idaho Technology Council for Most Innovative Company.

‚ÄúFor instance, one Toronto-based psychedelic company hired world famous comedian Russell Peters, who has Canadian roots.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm the Chief Creative Officer for Red Light Holland,‚Äù Peters told CityNews. ‚ÄúI got involved with the company via its CEO Todd Shapiro. He asked me if I would come on board and help run the creative side of it.‚Äù

Toronto-based Red Light Holland produces, grows and sells a premium brand of magic truffles within the Netherlands, a place where it is legal to do so.

In an upcoming documentary ‚ÄúVeracity, The Psychedelic Frontier‚Äù which will air on Citytv, our cameras went to Holland to show you their operations. Peters also talks more about the company and opens up about his own struggles.

The hour-long program also documents one war hero‚Äôs mental health struggles ‚Äì and his wild journey from Toronto to Vancouver to use a psychedelic that he hopes will save his life.

468,CO,"To my knowledge: Netherlands, Brazil, Jamaica, and some other smaller countries are all current legal marketplaces to target and are being targeted. 

there is not currently a North American market, but with legalization happening in Canada and with the new administration here in the US, I would not be surprised to see a market develop soon. Oregon just became the first state to decriminalize all drugs. Denver, CO decriminalized psilocybin. And I‚Äôm pretty sure DC has decriminalized psychedelics. so the development is happening. 

Am I early to the party? very well could be, I‚Äôm not much of a stock flipper as that has not worked out well for me. But nonetheless the growth is definitely there. They are e-commerce based plus they are being put in retailers throughout Netherlands. It‚Äôs not that they can‚Äôt supply a global market. It‚Äôs that there isn‚Äôt even a global psychedelic market existing to supply. As new markets develop, they will have an already established brand and product to deploy into the new market.

499,TSLA,"I got my education on stocks a rather traditional way. First a personal finance class taught by a former broker, then I went and got a couple degrees in business.

Real basic stocks move on 1 of 2 things, fundamentals and the story. TSLA was a story stock until they figured out how to produce and deliver vehicles, you were tied to whatever came out of Musk's twitter account. Microsoft or Pepsi are fundamentals based really the actual health and future of the business.

Pennies are a sour mix of both the ones that take off have a solid concept that can generate healthy fundamentals which is their future potential to be worth $100-200 a pop, companies like ABML are in this category. They start to rise when a story either gives them a boost to their fundamentals or like PSID 7 years ago a big piece of news triggers the pump and dump.",0.018,0.888,0.094,0.8519
500,EV,"Start with the concept. Will the concept work? AWGI is a great example. They have a really cool concept, making potable water from the atmosphere. Huge idea could have epic impact globally for securing safe water supplies in developing areas. 

After the concept think, can this make money? AWGI maybe, where the tech is most needed is in areas can't can't afford the tech and don't have clean water supplies, alternatively militaries might be able to use the tech but it's a backwards investment to solve a problem that they don't have yet. 

If both of those are positive (not AWGI) then a quick way to reference it's value would be a PE ratio. Price to earnings, basically how much money are they bringing in and what are you paying. Compare to that stocks in the same industry PE ratios are highly industry dependent. Make an assessment on the PE compared to other companies (look at Pepsi, coke and keurig Dr Pep). 

Many pennies don't make any money so buying into a company with 10 mil in debt that doesn't generate revenue is always a bad play.

If you are content with what this shows you or you don't care about the current earnings then develop a thesis for investing in the company. Ie this is why I want to invest in this company and this is what I think it's worth. My thesis for owning amazon is literally AWS which is the high margin end of the company if it gets split by regulators I know what and where I'm going. 

AMBL is similar for me, its concept is worth $100-$200 a share and could easily be an acquisition target for an EV or legacy auto manufacturer.

However, once they have financial incentive of being a shareholder I can bet they will start giving out their analyst recs of $2+ which will attract more money (retail and hopeful instituitional).  

Their growth is based on just simply opening locations which will really determine the ultimate revenue.  COVID is not going anywhere and testing is def. not going anywhere (likely to just increase under Biden).  The rate limiting step now that funding is done is simply hiring. Think they had some difficulty right after new years as the holidays made it difficult to interview and hire.  That should be back on quick now. 

I think they get to 100 in the next 1 month (double).  They have the funding now, the experience, and are prehiring folks at a rapid rate now.

So then you can start looking at those sectors and say ... hmm who are the potential winners in these sectors, and you can go further and research companies that are emerging and then contrast it with the top leaders.
