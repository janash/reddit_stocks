1,RH," At first I thought it was just Robinhood. But I checked a few others and they all say its been delisted from NYSE. 



Breakeven is ~75.05 on both dates. Stock is at 75.01 

If it's delisted, I dont know what kind of market there would be for both growth and/or selling the option contract if it does grow (why would it?)

So I think I'm going to end up eating the premiums entirely. Part of me feels like, why would RH allow people to sell calls on a seemingly impossible outcome.

412,IRS," Complete noob to life/investing/stocks/taxes everything basically.

My main question is about taxes. Ive never seen a tax form in my life, but people always say when buying stocks/investing, make sure to analyze the tax you would have to pay when you cash it and such.

But my question is like...how does the government know anything about our investing/stocks? Like if I just put 100$ into Robinhood, bought some random stock, and it goes up to like 105 or something. Then cash it out and put it into my bank account. How exactly do they know anything about it? Only reason I ask is because if I hypothetically invested into like 10 stocks.....Im not sure if I would be good at keeping track with what amount was invested when and what tax rate or something.


Basically Im just trying to find out the fool proof way of not royally screwing myself with the IRS, since Ive never done a tax form since my parents always took care of this stuff",superlucci,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/nkm13u/daily_discussion_thread_may_25th_2021/gzedvwk/,0.035,0.823,0.142,0.9666
413,IRS," >how does the government know anything about our investing/stocks?

Firms are required to send this to the IRS just like employers are required to send employee income data. The government gets it even before you do.",CardinalNumber,3,/r/RobinHood/comments/nkm13u/daily_discussion_thread_may_25th_2021/gzee887/,0.0,0.933,0.067,0.3612
414,IRS," Main tax implications (as far as i know about US tax) to consider with investments are about the timing of when you buy/sell. If you sell an investment after less than a year of buying it, you’ll have to pay higher taxes on your gains than if you held it for more than a year. Less than a year means you’ll pay the tax rate of your ordinary income, maybe 20 something %. If you hold it for more than a year, your gains will be taxed at the capital gains tax rate, probably 15%. Losses will reduce your gains to zero before reducing any of your ordinary gains, but only up to 3k of losses per year, the remainder being carried forward into the future. Losses may not be allowed if you sell and rebuy an investment without enough time passing (look up wash sale rules). If you have bought multiple of the same investment but at different times, some of which were bought less than a year before you sold and some more than a year, i believe the IRS looks at it as though you sold your oldest shares first when deciding whether it was a short term or long term investment. If you gain a lot from investing, be sure you have enough cash on hand when you file your taxes so that you will have enough to pay the tax on your gains since theres no one withholding your taxes for you like employers do. This is all off the top of my head, so feel free to google this stuff to confirm",HunterJK94,2,/r/RobinHood/comments/nkm13u/daily_discussion_thread_may_25th_2021/gzeqex5/,0.054,0.82,0.126,0.9675
