When I left the company two years ago, I was making 17 an hour as an hourly manager, and we were starting staff at 12 or 13 an hour I think. I took a pay cut and actually declined a promotion to Apprentice (Chipotle's term for a GM in training) to go to a smaller fast food company. It was absolutely worth it, Chipotle asks more of their staff than any company I've ever seen and I saw so many people burn out just like I did. In 5 years with that company, I worked for 11 GMs at 3 locations - and GM is probably the lowest turnover position there.

22,ANY," In your your explanation, the individual with no options (meaning they have no other viable job opportunities), has to work for less than a living wage, at the small business that can’t afford to pay more. But that’s the thing, if you force a wage hike and eliminate the small business, then this person with no opportunities doesn’t even have the option. There is no small business to work at. They went from “no other opportunities” to no opportunities at all. And big business sure aren’t going to be hiring MORE people than before, considering they have to pay even more for each employee. It results in less job openings overall, even though the openings pay more. People get left behind entirely (not getting ANY paycheck), there is less competition, and more monopolization. Prices will rise, further distancing cost of living from those that can’t get jobs in the first place.

From my perspective, idea of raising the minimum wage to help people pay their bills can’t stand on it’s own foundation. It’s predicated upon people being able to have jobs in the first place. But it ultimately eliminates jobs, raises cost of living (disproportionately affecting those that can’t get a job), AND leaves people behind, all while creating obstacles for any small business competing against the large corporations. 


I’m not saying that there’s no room to look at the minimum wage as part of the problem.

They have in the past and they will keep doing so in the future. It's fine if you're still bullish about the stock, but don't act like it's the next big thing that is completely undervalued, because the growth just really isn't there to support it.

I get that crypto/iGaming/e-wallets will become even bigger than they are today, but all of those industries have grown by allot in the last couple of years. Paysafe was already active in most of those industries, but yet they haven't been able to capitalize on that industry-wide growth. It's totally fair to judge them on that fact. I don't really get the point in repeating ""yeah but that industry will get bigger so more revenue!!!"" It already got bigger and they didn't profit that much from it. Under 10% annual growth since 2016 is disappointing, doesn't matter how you look at it. If they somehow projected some amazing growth now, I would get the optimism, but those projections just aren't there.",bmfd_,1,/r/stocks/comments/n8zkio/psfe_paysafe_a_better_way_to_bet_on_multiple_high/gxndrfq/,0.055,0.808,0.136,0.9785

39,DKNG," Spending seems to be the big drawback at this point to a lot of people, personally I'm not worried yet. DKNG's strategy this whole time has been a larger outlay to get more customers in the door and then hope to keep them. Revenue numbers would say, that's working. At some point, yes margins are going to have to get better but we are still in the early stages of sports betting where the emphasis is more on expansion than profits. If we are talking 3+ years down the road with widespread betting and DKNG is still losing money, that's more of an issue.

214,ATH," I'd love to. I wasn't trying to offend, just hard not to laugh at a random internet stranger giving such factually stated advice that runs directly contrary to most industry professionals. 

My short term outlook isn't as optimistic as yours. Given abnormally high P/E and extreme valuations throughout the market, I'm betting we're due for a solid pullback in asset prices ranging from 10-15%. I don't expect this to have much impact on the economy though since the fed has a pretty firm firm hand on the trigger to prevent recession. After the market corrects, I expect to finish the year strong, but we're unlikely to reach higher than the current ATH we're seeing now. 

Predicting the future is tough. Simple fundamentals show prices are too high. Investors at both the retail level and the institutional level are expecting a pull back. Consumer cash is high and with the economy opening back up we should see some healthy cash flow throughout the economy.",Sinsyxx,3,/r/stocks/comments/n9ayi1/misunderstood_market_fueled_by_fear_mongering/gxn0uho/,0.049,0.827,0.123,0.8625

221,TD," Do you have details from any source?

Overleveraged? What does that mean? Even if companies doubled their leverage since a decade ago, interest rates are 1/3 what they were 10 years ago... So what does that mean overall?

Naked Shorts? Do you have evidence? I have accounts with IB, TD, Fidelity, Etrade and Shwab. None of them allow naked shorts. Thats not to say it cant happen, and maybe they give special privileges to hedge funds and such, but do you have any numbers or you just guessing?

Fraud MBS's? Again whats the evidence? I dont think there is anything of the sort in residential. Most of those loans have plenty of equity or are agency and again, interest rates are literally 1/3 what they were a decade ago. So even if price is 2x higher, payments are still lower than then. Commercial is certainly a problem but thats been true for decades now since the internet age began.

I do think there is a stock bubble and an insane amount of speculation. I think at least half of the new tech startups wont survive. There is also a general inflation of valuation going on that leaves me uncomfortable but thats been going on since Reagan opened the floodgates. Its not new. Still I dont like it.

Buying low, selling high doesn't feel as good as one would expect. I feel like shit and question what am i doing when buying at the most fearful days, it feels like catching a falling knife, like the sinking has just started.

I feel like shit when everyone is happy, chatty, buying, enjoying at ATH and i just have to wait and wait and wait, i can't buy, i can only sell, but how long ? Maybe the stock really can only go up from its ATH ? Why am i missing out on greatest shit i have ever seen, like this next thing x is the future of everything and i can't stop thinking how could anything else except this thing be leading the future, is it really bad to buy it after it went up 1000% if it will go up 1000% more ?

243,FL," I’m not an economist, but I do believe I have a good fundamental understanding of macroeconomics, and I have the same concerns.

I don’t believe this monetary policy from the Fed is sustainable. Printing trillions of dollars, giving out $1400 checks to 85% of the country, keeping interest rates at 0% (basically since the global financial crisis, save a year or two where we were at ~2%), and else-wise pumping obscene amounts of money into the economy is bound to lead to rampant inflation at some point.

As for how to prepare, a good general principle is to buy stocks in companies that will be unaffected by inflation, or even benefit from it. For example, I own a stake in Foot Locker. Foot Locker’s basic business model is to buy shoes from manufacturers like Nike and sell them in retail stores at a premium. These manufacturers usually manufacture in China, where I am less concerned about inflation than within the US, meaning that the cost to manufacture these shoes likely won’t increase. Nike and other manufacturers can then keep wholesale prices consistent instead of raising them with inflation, and Foot Locker will be able to buy their inventory at the same prices as before. They will also be able to raise their retail prices in line with inflation because demand for essential products like shoes is liable to remain constant. Their cost of goods would remain the same, but their revenues would increase. In this scenario, they would actually benefit from inflation and grow their margins.

There is a possibility that NKE and other manufacturers would decide to raise prices in-line with inflation, which would prevent FL from growing their margins at all (in which case, it would be manufacturers like Nike that benefit). That being said, Foot Locker could still increase prices and would at least remain largely unaffected.

In other words, look for companies that sell essential products, where rising prices will not lead to a drop in demand, i.e., shoes, pharmaceuticals, food, etc.

Another strategy would be buying stocks in payment connections firms like Visa or MasterCard. As spending increases, leading to inflation, these companies will be largely unaffected as their basic business model is to charge fees for processing transactions. As spending increases and more transactions happen, there will be more fees for companies like Visa to earn (although I can’t say I recommend buying at these valuations).

I do not believe you should liquidate your stocks in favor of “assets that protect against inflation”.

251,ATH," >What is driving the growth?

They are invested in multiple segments. The newest one is automobiles, which is also extremely profitable and slated for continued growth. They are currently at a 29.7% market share for TDDIs in automobiles. That's despite being capped right now in supply. The future guidance growth for Q2 will largely be attributed to this segment.

Besides that, they also have TCONs in high-end TVs, Display Drivers in devices such as Phones, Tablets, and Large Panels (tvs, monitors, notebooks). Other misc categories, which can you find, and another one (WiseEye) slated for mass production in Q3 - Q4 2021ish.

So essentially: demands for electronics in general. Expensive electronic products also providing a sizeable return.

As we can also see, TDDIs are forecasted to continue growing each additional year, from 921 M units in 2020 to 1.168 B.

>How are they affected by the current shortage?

Supply is limited, but they are still breaking record #'s. They stated in the Q4 earnings that supply will increase each consecutive quarter in 2021. Not to mention, that supply each quarter would exceed the demand/supply back in Q4 2020, which we can see as a result in their financials. Q4 was a record ATH quarter, and Q1 was a larger increase above even that. That's why I'm largely excited about this year, this country is going to exceed the $1 B revenue cap with solid financials, EPS and Gross Margin.

252,FB," Depends on the stock. If it does poorly, it will drop. If it beats all estimates by not enough, it might drop. If it beats all estimates by A LOT, then it will go up when the markets open (can still go to red by the end of the day).

You got to also take into consideration if its priced in or not, in other words, if the stock is in a upward trend or downward trend. For example, FB has been in a downward trend 1-2 weeks before earnings after reaching $315. It went down to $305 and then after earnings it went up to $330 (opening hours).

So, a stock will go up if it beats estimates in a downward trend.

The opposite tends to occure when the stock is in a upward trend. Like Apple and Microsoft, they were already in a upward trend and after a great earning, people sell it for profit.

But Google was in upward trend and after beating estimates, it went up.

If a company doesn't outperform their projection from the previous quarter by a large margin than the share price will either drop, or remain relatively the same.

Now the real reason why a company drops **heavy** after earnings but their projection from the quarter before was correct? Then it's because the companies outlook for **next quarter is not good**. This is 9 times out of 10 the reason why a companies share price drops after earnings even if they ""beat earnings"" (beat their projection from last quarter).

Maybe you can give some examples of what companies your talking about? If it was RKT, it's because they are expecting a 20% decrease in loans next quarter. A mortgage company with a 20% decrease in loans next quarter?

255,ETSY," Changes every earnings season for each company.  Depends on current market climate, where the hot money is going, and a bunch of other factors.

An example:  ETSY had amazing earnings that beat expectations but their forward guidance for the next quarters is lower because they expect to take a hit due to re-openings.  If they end up retaining a lot of customers that liked the service their next earnings report will probably cause them to go rocket up, even after the run-up leading into earnings.  So in the case of ETSY, tech was overbought but there is uncertainty due to market climate for lockdown winners.

This sort of analysis is required for each company, and even then it's basically a coinflip because short term is unpredictable.  A better move is to play surprise events on companies (and play it faster than other people) rather than these static dates which you have no deep insight about (unless you work for the company) and can be heavily manipulated by whales.",SuperStockBros,1,/r/stocks/comments/n8szq9/earnings_reports_always_cause_a_dip/gxklyr7/,0.065,0.813,0.123,0.8968

Apple recent change impacts app traffic but the ability to monitor and retarget based on behaviour was already hampered significantly over the past 18 months due to Safari ITP and Firefox ETP, and these changes are debatably as or more damaging to TTD business model but haven't hurt revenues.

Digital will continue to win share of ad spend but likely that less emphasis will be placed on behavioural retargeting and the methods of measuring effectiveness will be adjusted.

My main concern is that all the changes above are more likely to handicap the ""little guy"" and result in even more ad spend concentration with the big platforms and publishers that have registration and first party data at scale.  Also important to note that one of the biggest growing areas in digital right now is SME and TTD isn't really accessible to them but Facebook and Google are amazing in this space.

311,GME," Yes, people will attempt to pump a stock they have invested heavily in, in a attempt to raise the price so that they can take profit. It's been proven that stock tickers that were mentioned on WSB and other subs would see and increase in price in the following days because of people FOMOing in and media algorithms catching hold of it. At least, that was the case post GME but I'm not sure if it's still like that.

Tbh I'm not sure how common it is, but I'm a newer investor who became interested when WSB started making news and it seemed like there was a pump and dump every day on there and some penny stock subs. It took me a couple of weeks to figure it out and I lost a couple hundred bucks to a dumb scam (RTON lol)... luckily I only invested a small amount. 

My advice would be to spend time lurking in any new stocks/investing sub for a couple of weeks before making any decisions about anything based on what you read there. As a new investor you need some time to figure out your portfolio, and getting caught up in FOMO isn't really going to help you. 

There's no way to really know who's behind a screen. It's been alleged that companies pay people to set up fake online profiles just to try to sway user's opinions about certain stocks on Reddit and other platforms.

330,FAST," Not long on iRBT.

I am a professional product developer and one of the things I have developed in the past: Robot vacuums.

Some things you may not know.

1. I robot actually licenses their older design patents to competitors on the open market.

Some of the discounter designs are literally just knock-offs of older Roomba's patents/designs.

I don't believe in Roomba long-term and here is why:

Those generics offer similar performance at a lower price compared to Roomba.

I had one of each (remember this is 2019 and not current) and was testing designs to see which one we should patent-design around (basically deciding which design type is best then knocking it off in a way that does not legally violate patents).

The patents Roomba leased were kind of forced. Their technology was 100% stolen and dumped onto the Chinese market so they pursued litigation and took a check for licensing deal since it was already publicly available. This includes source code and includes pretty much everything except the vacuum cleaning patterns (stored in the hardware, but was actively being dumped in an effort to decode).

In the end, the generics performed very close to Roomba in every test except pattern logic (the patterns the Roomba takes are superior to the Chinese ones but cleaning efficacy is nearly identical).

I see Roomba has squandered its position as market leader and spent most of its money on advertising for short-term sales and doesn't really appear to be staying ahead as far as performance, R&D, and technology.

My info is a bit old (2019ish) but I have to say that Roomba seemed like its days were numbered due to competition catching up FAST using Roomba's very own technology as a springboard aginst them.",NotThatSpecialToo,8,/r/stocks/comments/n9680h/dd_irbt_the_dust_has_settled/gxm7yx7/,0.047,0.894,0.059,0.7606
331,AI," The Samsung probably had the best Tech but all the extra parts inside also means it will never be cost-efficient. Talk about over-engineering.

I would have picked one of the cheaper Chinese competitors at random and selected them as the ""future"" really as I see the tech as adding unnecessary expense but not really adding much to the actual performance.

Reasoning: It seems cheap ""dumb"" robot vacuums with good (cheap) patterns and a SHAPE/WHEELS that prevents getting stuck will be more ""future"" than adding (expensive) super-genius intelligence and apps to a robot to avoid getting stuck on your kitchen threshold.

Being ""smarter"" with maps and learning AI just means I have to find and unstick it less often. Considering how easy it is to find (almost always in the same place) I dont think the added expense of AI justifies the convenience.

Robot vacuums are quite simple and adding layers of technology doesn't make them clean better. The ones that map and ""learn"" your home get stuck less, but clean the same and also prevent a security risk IMO as now your 3D home floor plan can be sold to strangers by Roomba (read their app ToS).

I guess I'm having a hard time grasping this idea of why people are using the market cap to evaluate a company. Since the market cap is based on people's perspectives which could be right or wrong. 

So the real work here is determining if the EV is currently or will be less than the real BV, if that's the case then it will be considered as undervalue, am I right?

The real question Here is, so you Trust the Market? Or so you want to do your own Research. Valuating with Market Cap is always the easy way. Valuating with DCF is the hard way because you need to valuate the future perspective of a company by yourself Based on current available Data.

Their software is also more seamless than just zoom. Dealing with insurance SUCKS for patients and providers, dealing with tdoc support is good, and their reviews vs WalMarts MeMD supports this. Telemed is the future of healthcare, but the question is, which servicer will come out on top? 

10,000 boomers will retire daily for the next 20 years.

I own neither of these stocks but here is an example. I love Tesla and think it's a great company...But the share price doesn't make much sense to buy  at &750+ in terms of potential returns. 

On the other hand I believe NIO at roughly $40 a share MAY be more valuable in terms of return. I don't necessarily think NIO is a better company but it just seems like it would give more value. I see NIO hitting 80 sooner than Tesla hitting 1500

Diminishing returns plays a huge role.

You argue that XOM isn't a buy due to their large debt and their inability to cover their dividend. That's a disingenuous argument. 

When it comes to leverage, you look at the industry average- not whether they have a lot of debt. The oil and gas exploration business is capital intensive and **requires** companies to be highly leveraged to remain competitive. XOM still has far less debt compared to BP and Shell.

You argue that XOM isn't a buy due to their large debt and their inability to cover their dividend. That's a disingenuous argument. 

When it comes to leverage, you look at the industry average- not whether they have a lot of debt. The oil and gas exploration business is capital intensive and **requires** companies to be highly leveraged to remain competitive. XOM still has far less debt compared to BP and Shell.

Harvest has messed up in the past and still manages over 100% growth in revenue consistently.  They've done a bunch of owning up and fixing bad purchase decisions so if anything I was more bullish.

Looking at TCNNF, do I really expect them to 4x in price?  Last year they made $521M in revenue and HRVSF just upped projections this year to make $400M in revenue.  So how do they get to buy them at 1/10 of share?  Sure they are profitable but it was only a matter of time for HRVSF. 

Now I see this law firm put out a press release on investigating them for ""fiduciary duty""  It also says current HRVSF shareholders will own ""only 26.7% of Truleive's issued and outstanding pro forma Trulieve shares.""  Maybe this is why they couldn't go any higher because if they gave anymore HRVSF shareholders would own too high a %?  Not sure if this is correct, I assume they are creating new shares to give us?

475,API," That's a great point, I'd expect that to be a significant contribution too. I tried to look into the stock price the day or hour after a post was made, but unfortunately the API I was using to pull prices just wasn't good enough to compare such exact times (hence the need to look at longer time frames to shrink margin of error).

With that being said, lots of these predictions grew much more in the long term than what might be attributed to pump action. Again, a bunch of predictions 10x'ed over 6 months. I attribute this more to the super volatile nature of penny stock trading- they would likely be less successful in a bear market.

Me neither, I was talking about NASDAQ index which is commonly used to benchmark tech performances. How do you even talk about tech without talking about quotes? 

I frankly don't get where you're coming from - you talk about a correction that for you *did* happen via pesky hedge funds that shorted 90% of tech for *reasons* but then NASDAQ didn't even reach a 6 months low - and punctually ignore hedge funds that *really* overleveraged like Archegos pumping VIAC to the stars.

503,VIAC," > Instagram doesn't equal all tech stocks. What are you even trying to say? That time spent on phones is a 1-1 correlation with tech stock prices?

No. That time spent on Instagram correlates with Instagram value.

> Also, the correction where 90% of ALL tech stocks just dropped over the last few months. Since short interest has been increasing every week from over-leveraged hedge fund accounts.

504,ATH," Saying that plenty of sectors didnt crash, when a definition of a crash for a certain sector is a specific % drop, and the vast majority in all these sectors did IN FACT drop more than 40% from their ATH, its simple. Lots of sectors have crashed over the last 4 months. I didn't say NASDAQ crashed I said tech crashed. More than just tech crashed too. Again, I don't just stare at SPY and indexes all day. I'm staring at the sectors on fire sale that have crashed.

I really don't think you read a single word I said.

 'Again, it is a product of your imagination, it didn't happen in real life. NASDAQ touched its peak literally two weeks ago.' This is just fucking stupid, I'm sorry for the attack but it is. Have you just ignored about 70% of the entire market for all of 2021 so far? I could list about a thousand tickers that have in fact crashed. Nasdaq might not have crashed, but you're ignoring the point of what I'm saying.",Microtonal_Valley,2,/r/stocks/comments/n99k5g/nasdaq_correction_is_needed_lets_be_honest/gxna6fa/,0.098,0.874,0.028,-0.8799
505,CMRE," The market is rotating, there will not be a crash, there will not be hyperinflation, there will not be just 2% inflation, commodities are not the only cure as a hedge to protect yourself and neither is yoloing into $PG... CMRE and CRE motgages will bust around the same time the fed will need to change policy and talk/enact rate hikes and bond tapering due to 3-5% inflation (which although high is historically normal) after that we will see a broader 10-25% market correction due to margin debt and valuation models ignoring fundamentals, many currently fair value companies suchs as $LMT $REYN, and $TSM (I would argue 4.1x revenue at $110/share is fair value) will drop leaving smart money an excellent buying opportunity while the mass media and broader market panic sells, hedgefunds are still overleveraging which is the greatest danger to the market currently i.e $BLK but their stocks and funds will not crash down until policy change since borrowing money is so cheap and making money off that regardless of interest is easy. Notice how on a visual like finviz you can see that rotation
