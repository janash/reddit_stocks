So I have warrants available to me to purchase via TD Ameritrade for about 0.60 (looked several hours ago).  If I understand correctly, the information for these is in their s-1. But looking in the document on sec's website,  it shows: 


""
warrants for 3,529,412 shares of common stock issued in a private placement in May 2020 to investors with an exercise price of $1.00 that expire on November 15, 2025;

warrants for 494,118 shares of common stock issued in May 2020 to the placement agent for the private placement, with an exercise price of $1.3281 per share that expire on May 14, 2025.""

386,DD," I can understand that. Just remember, the farmer with only a single chicken risks his livelihood on one bad egg. A good farmer will have a lot of chickens to rely on.

Diversify as much as possible, but make sure you look into each company first.

Do not sell in a panic, thats how you lose capital. If you are panicking because of a 10% dip then you didn't look at a company well enough.

Dips happen all the time. Just look at the history and consider this, is the dip because of a scandal in the company, overhype, poor performance review, or just because guys who bought at 1.53 are cashing out now that its 1.97? If the later, hold. Buy the dip if you can afford it. It will lower your average cost and increase profits later on.

Monitor the dips daily, most sites have a big dipper page, look at companies that lost 20% today and see why they dropped (Use reference above). You may find another good buy.

Stay within budget. Every penny spent needs to be looked at as if its already gone. Once you profit enough to recoup without selling everything, do so. It make take a week, month, year, etc. But with DD you can get an idea of how things are going.

The chart on this concerns me. This company spent the better part of two years between $8 and about $16, even reaching $20 at one point in June 2018.

Then, they plummeted and haven't really been above $6 in about 16 months except very briefly in July they barely touched that point. They've been in the $3 range since then.

It scares me to see such a fall, and this one in particular has stuck around long enough to be real. I'm going to add this to a watch list and see how those phase 3 trials go.

If heavily shorted stocks meant they will always be squeezed then there would be no barriers to making infinite money.

I won‚Äôt claim to be an expert or dare to say this stock will go parabolic. Even though my post is about shorts, I am a long-term holder, even post merger, because I believe in metamaterials and what they are developing and who they are partnered with. By no means is this stock doubling tomorrow, just because it had a run up on Friday AH and then today. All signs point to trading lower tomorrow.

524,MICT," \*\*\*\*\*DD Here\*\*\*\*\*\*\*TLDR below\*\*\*\*\*\*

MICT operates through two subsidiaries - Global Fintech Holdings Intermediate Ltd (essentially a trading platform) and Micronet Ltd (in-vehicle mobile applications).

Combined operating results for the past 9 months 2020 as below....

(i) Operating loss -$7.4 mil

(ii) Revenues $349k

(iii) Marketing expense -$69k

(iv) G&A expense -$4 mil to pay consultant fees, director salaries.

(v) R&D expense $230k

There was one line from the partnership PR that made me wary, *‚ÄúOur key strategic alliance with the Exchange drives* ***high-margin revenue growth potential for MICT through both per contract commissions*** *and the lucrative margin financing associated with leveraged futures and commodity products trading, among other related service fees. The fact that our* ***clients are comprised of government and government-backed entities, among others, provides an element of low financial default risk***\*, supported in part from the strong financial relationships Xinhau brings to the venture. ""

A lack of retail traders due to expensive commissions means low liquidity on the exchange, and we all know that brokers profit from high volume transactions so this is a red flag to me.

**TLDR: Company running two loss-making businesses with questionable long term value, spends more cash on paying its directors salaries than on R&D efforts.**

826,AGTC," I did this too, Sitting back at the moment and letting things play out. The risk right now is huge, nothing is near it's floor. Everything you put into at least on RH has the real possibility of dumping 50-70% at any time. The only thing you can do to make money right now is try and jump onto an already runaway train and hope you can jump off before it derails.

There are absolutely some great plays out there but unfortunately theyve been diliuted by the QUICK CASH NOW hype monsters and it's very hard to tell if you picked a good one or just a hype. And even if you DID pick a real solid fundamentally good ticker, about half of them are having premature ejaculations due to the influx of new users.

I honestly think at some point the hype train will have run through every available penny stock on RH.

Also AGTC, the most talked about ticker on here is not a penny stock, I wish it would disappear off this sub.

849,FAMI, Diversifying is literally the opposite of yoloing. How many times have you had 1/5 of your portfolio in a stock and wish that you‚Äôd have bought more shares ? 100% of your portfolio in a stock is a yolo and If you like a stock / feel good about it then I would recommend going with a full send yolo. This is obviously much riskier and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this with a larger account but if you have a small account and want to see serious gains you‚Äôre going to have to go full yolo sometimes.
