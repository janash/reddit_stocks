7,DD, Ugh your DD in this pharma company is WAY OFF. Diclofenac is now generic you can buy it as voltaren gel for like 20-30 bucks depending on where you live. As a physician I’ve never ordered zorvolex even when diclofenac was on formulary. Toradol(ketorolac) is like 16 bucks with good RX. Long story short don’t look up the brands with drugs look up the name for the compound.

37,ASRT," Very good points. When I looked into ASRT what attracted me was not their drug pipeline but they’re slow release technology to improve medication adherence. I see this as a major differentiator and have come across a couple startups in this space. Medication adherence is a huge issue that undermines outcomes and increases overall healthcare costs. Many top tier pharma companies are TRYING to reformulate their drugs so patients don’t have to take a pill multiple times a day - similar to monthly vs daily birth control options. Sometimes when trying to prove that a technology works, you have to start with the lowest hanging fruit and I think that’s perhaps why they’ve gone after these “non-sexy” drugs. I think their key to success will be in partnerships/ licensing deal with orally delivered blockbuster drug manufacturers who are trying to get a handle on the adherence issue (most of them!).",peleau784,4,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lp9m25/dd_on_the_top_5_most_mentioned_stocks_in_the_last/gob1lrg/,0.041,0.81,0.149,0.953

- constant moving of money. Too quick with judgements and emotions. I had a great position with ZOM at 1.20. But since I took some profits then invested back in at higher prices, I’ve averaged up to 1.94...lame. It’ll still be fine but it does irk me I did that.

228,DD," SHIP “Seanergy Maritime”

Currently trading at $1.62. Analysts ratings at $6.00. My own personal price target sits at $2.90-$3.40

The small recent breakout seen here 
https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SHIP 

Was due to SHIP gaining compliance with Nasdaq. On this day SHIP opened up at $1.50 and closed at $2.10 for a total of 44.55% for the day. This breakout was quickly retracted with news of SHIP securities being sold to institutional corporations for 75 million dollars at a low price of $1.70 per share (44 million shares total). The price quickly dropped and has hovered in the $1.70 area until Friday when it closed at $1.62. The Overseer of this securities was prompted by Maxim Group LLC.

SHIP just purchased a new shipping vessel for 17m using cash on hand. This vessel was purchased from Japan and is Greenhouse Gas Regulation compliant (Big deal for the future of shipping companies. All 12 ships have currently passed this regulation). Delivery is expected by the end of the first quarter or beginning of the 2nd (more than likely anytime soon). This purchase will make the 12th addition to SHIP vessels.

Wall Street Journal currently has SHIP price target listed at $6.00. Current price is $1.62. This target price makes SHIP a prime buying zone in its current trading price. Personally, I expect a slow ascend in the next 1-2 weeks followed by another breakout when the new shipping carrier arrives.

I'm on the side that their product will be a big deal, as I've seen a lot of doctors and nurses saying blood catheter infections are a common problem in hospitals, and from what I've seen there's really no competition to CTXR in this regard.  That being said, it all depends on the April results for the FDA.  The results thus far have been INSANELY good, but the criticism I've heard in the sample size has been low.  I'm not an expert in medical testing, so I'm not sure of the exacts, but there was enough good news in all of that to keep me in.",jpklein89,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lpbapg/daily_discussion_thread/godbylc/,0.111,0.825,0.064,-0.6741

DSWL doesn't have much visibility/PR and seems to be quite secretive so volume usually only picks up around dividend dates but it does mean that it is a very stable stock and less liable to pump and dumps. 

>Also, how's the institutional ownership?

Institutional ownership is high with 65% of shares being owned by executives - this proportion has been increasing throughout 2020. Additionally there have been no sell-offs despite the recent and sustained price increases. The management team has been with the company for an average of 21 years and they're very bullish on future prospects. This is likely to be a longer holding but with a high dividend yield (5-7%) I'm more than okay with that.

509,ZOM," The hype is on Truforma, a highly specific diagnostic tool for pets only.   This product doesn't necessarily do something that can't be presently done, it just does it faster.  So forget about them moving into a market with no competition.  Important to understand because when you look at the total number of veterinarian (about 110k in the US) this product will not be adopted by every one of them (and being generous, presume no two veterinarians work together).  So you have a product that has a very limited testing function in a naturally limited market place and ZOM cannot expand into the big market (humans) because they don't own the technology they were just given a license for it specifically for animal use.

By Zom's own statement they think the animal testing market etc. is going to be roughly 2.8billion in 2024.  ZOM has 946 million shares outstanding, trading at $2 gives it a market cap of 1.8billion... see where im going with this?  Using some rough math, if the market does hit 2.8 billion in 2024, if Zom were trading at $2.96 it would have a market cap equal to the entire value of the market they are selling into.  That's looney, especially when you consider the first point above, highly limited product in a limited market place with no potential to expand out.  My numbers might be slightly off because im ballparking, but if you got your own numbers plug them in, math is math.  You can see there is no real possibility for this to moon because there so many shares outstanding, and every time the company needs more money it just sells more shares.  If you want even further insight into the shares, go see how many stock options the officers have, four months ago it was a big deal, when they had half the amount of shares outstanding as they do today, maybe it's less a big deal now compared to the outstanding shares, but those guys also have millions of options out there, meaning further dilution if those get exercised.

The fundamentals are also not very good.  Has it ever turned a profit?  If you're forward looking and betting on the Truforma to buck it's past trend, then please see the above. Look at the history of the company, do you think it's an accident they have 950m (it had 550m shares 4 months ago) shares out standing?  It's not, every time they need more money they just sell more shares. If that trend continues that means further dilution.  Don't think it will happen?  Maybe...considering they just did yet another offering on feb 9 iirc.

So you have a company selling a product with limited application into a small market that already has products that do the same thing, a massive number of shares outstanding with a company that has no reservations about selling more, and officers with millions of stock options that can further add to dilution.

547,DD," With you on that. I have 65 at an average of $10.33. I'm not going to list all the DD but I encourage people to check it out. As Bitcoin spikes so will EBON. They should have a crypto exchange rollout in April. Their mining machines are in demand at around $3,000 a piece depending on which model. They are going to start mining their own Bitcoin, however everything I've looked at says that they won't depend on that. They have a range of services, not just the crypto market.

1. This was a very old SPAC that started in 2017 and took forever and ever to complete merger
2. Because of delays, lot of shareholders ""redeemed"" their shares (You can do this in SPACs)
3. This gave a false impression that the company might not be good
4. This SPAC had 12 million rights that automatically convert into 1.2 million shares after the merger.
5. Most of the right holders bought them between .10 and .30(which equates to $1 to $3 in price)
6. After the merger, most of the rights holders dumped their shares to lock in profit or break even rather than wait for the common to go up
7. Hence the big drop from $11 to $2
8. The fundamentals of this company and team are world class. So it's just a matter of time it's true value is reflected in the share price. 
9. SPAC managers are NOT involved in the operations or management of ATNF in any way shape or form. They have nothing to do with ATNF anymore. 
10. All the SPAC issues are behind them now

624,DD," Buying low and selling high mostly comes down to luck. What's more important is ignoring FOMO. Find stocks with good DD that doesn't seem to be up over 100% in the past week/month, then hold it and sell when you're comfortable with the profit and move on.

Having said that when the market is on a bull run you can typically expect dips around 1030-11am EST after the morning sell offs as well as a lot of aftermarket/premarket gains at which point you can sell right at open the following day....rinse and repeat. Not every stock will follow this pattern, but it's a known behavioral pattern in the stock market.
