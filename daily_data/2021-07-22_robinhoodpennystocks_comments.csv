0,DD, While I agree Bezos is a supervillain..  I have to disagree that no one reads that part.  When I see your posts I read the whole thing.  Always refreshing to see someone who does something they obviously enjoy while helping people at the same time.  Please keep it up.  I‚Äôm new to trading and these posts help me pick new companies to do DD on.,kresslin,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/op11pr/penny_stock_unusual_option_activity_721/h62u50t/,0.068,0.75,0.182,0.7964

13,IPA," Dang it. Picked the wrong ticker to play today and got wreckt. Lost a bit over half what I made yesterday. 

Learned good lessons though. The strategy I have developed seems solid. It‚Äôs just crucial to apply it to the right stock. I was too jumpy with the one I picked (IGC) and didn‚Äôt double check my screener to notice better ones popped up by 8am. Namely IPA. I think I can get the hang of momentum trades but I have to do a better job researching the company and catalysts and not committing to a target into 9am. 

Oh well glad I cut losses before I lost all the profit and more. Just gonna use this as a good learning lesson.",OKJMaster44,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/op2auj/daily_discussion_thread/h64ys4s/,0.117,0.695,0.188,0.8864

17,SWK," Nice comprehensive overview. Re: their gross margins, the accounting on those was botched the first three quarters last year.

Small floats vs. large floats is relative but **under 20M shares in the publicly tradeable float** is what I look for.

A float is the amount of tradeable stock in the system, the difference between outstanding shares and the float is what is non-restricted and tradeable.",SituationLive4406,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/opdpx4/tiny_float_potential_runner_profitable_trading/h64vzib/,0.0,0.817,0.183,0.9092

20,DD," Maybe Robinhood should accept this as a tradeable penny stock. If you claim to be the investor you are, do more DD by researching the company and checking the news yourself.
