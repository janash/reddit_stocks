Impossible to do such in-depth analysis of companies to pump out videos on a regular basis.

32,IMO," I could write you an essay cus I've researched to the tits but I'll try and keep it short ish.. 

- China is the single biggest EV market in the world, and will be for the foreseeable future. Right now, Nio has a formidable share of the Premium sector, specifically premium SUVs. They've also started pre orders for their first Sedan model, the ET7, pretty exceptional car by all accounts.

- Battery swapping. This is the love-it-or-hate-it part of Nio. A lot of people think the concept is redundant because it only works if there is no one in the queue ahead of you. However it has several really cool advantages. Firstly, Chinese cities are very dense and most people, even the upper class, don't have homes where they can install chargers, they live in high-rise apartments. They can commute to work and only have to swap their battery once a week, twice at most. Then the obvious advantage is on long journeys, you can 0-100 charge in <5 minutes with no queue. The third advantage ties into Battery as a Service...

- BaaS. You can save money upfront when you buy a Nio because you RENT the battery, as opposed to buying it. Why is this beneficial? The upfront price is less. If you want to upgrade car in the next 2-3 years you save money (Premium sector, nio customers can afford to upgrade every few years). Resale value is not tied to the battery. New battery gets released with more capacity? Upgrade your rental scheme to the new one. Tesla's do not offer any of these benefits, in fact no other car company does because it cannot be done without battery swap tech. Again, some love it, others swear by it. The entire battery swap and BaaS is in my opinion what makes nio so unique whilst also being the thing that scares investors. 

I said I'd make it short (lol) so I'll skim the rest. Several strategic deals (swap stations in Sinopec service stations Nationwide), insanely high customer referral rates, very good outlook for scaling (don't have the numbers on hand), recently launched in Norway which has one of the highest rates of EV adoption worldwide, very good self driving tech partnerships (mobileye). Government subsidies which only apply to cars with battery swap tech AKA only apply to Nio. They've bought back most of the stake that they had to give up when the got bailed out. Very healthy vehicle margins. Consensus seems to be that the vehicle quality is exceptional, superior to the equivalent Tesla's.

If I had to be honest and give you some cons: a lot of their success will rest on their conviction in battery swap. The possibility that legacy makers like Ford etc swoop in and dominate (general consensus is that they will struggle to do so, they are very far behind and consumers seem to prefer sole EV makers so far). In terms of the stock price, China comes with some risks.  Arguably their market cap is priced in for years to come. 

IMO it's an amazing buy right now, off the top of my head I think $50-60 is fair valuation

EDIT: wrote this on mobile at 3am and probably didn't do each point justice. Go watch videos on battery swapping and battery as a service (BaaS). If you are sold afterwards and believe in it, consider investing. If you think it is doomed to fail, don't touch Nio. It's very intrinsic to why they are unique and why some people think they could literally be the Number 1 EV maker in the world in a few years. If they ever decide to admit they were wrong and abandon it, it would be disastrous, but I'm a believer in it",Aldous_Underwood,23,/r/stocks/comments/nnyfep/more_and_more_i_see_yt_content_creators_with_new/gzxlyuh/,0.067,0.798,0.135,0.9944

37,AMC," Companies will die out if they can't manage, it's that simple. If they keep posting red numbers, people will sell, sell means the stock goes down etc. That is natural behaviour.

Buying and selling shares in it's basis is very normal. You invest in something you believe in, and sell when you either want to use the money for something else, or because you got worries about the future of the company.

Stock helps the company when they are doing well, and doesn't help when they are doing poorly.

Options are simply betting on a company with others. 

Shorting is betting with a companies assets that you don't even own.

Now in the stockmarket people look at numbers, not people. But now imagine this is your buddy who has a small business.

You got friends who invest in it.
You got friends who have a wager on whether he will make it succeed.
And here you are, you don't believe in his company, and aren't just betting on him losing it, but you are making it worse, benefitting from constantly undercuttint his business.

Dick move right?

Would AMC be a dead (or within say 2-3 years) company if covid hadn't hit? No clue. The fact is they raised a lot of capital, so who knows right. 
Would AMC be a dead with covid hitting and no one shorted? No clue either, would hwve hurted for sure.
Would AMC be dead if retails didn't jump in to save it from shorters? Yes.

The only thing we know for sure, is that shorters probably would have been succesful manipulate the stock so much that they would bankrupt it.

If people want to bet against a company, go right ahead, buy puts. But actively shorting, especially that much to bankrupt, that's messed up.

AMC wasn't doing well, but they had a ton of capital left, all the money raised, was stock they held for like 10 years I think, if covid hadn't hit them, or been shorted that much, they would be in a much stronger position. Atm they are solid for at least 2 years, this could have been 5-10 easily if this didn't happen.

This is seeing someone in a tough fight, get knocked down, and you plaxe your bets against them, jump in the ring and start kicking them while down.

If you think this is fine, then that's sociopathic behaviour.

NIO is not a good company to buy, but that separate from it’s not a good company because it probably is a good company from my understanding.

Think about it this way. You go to a boxing match, you bet on the outcome of the fight, you are sure boxer A is gonna win. So instead of betting of just betting on that boxer, you step in the ring and use a baseball bat to make sure boxer B will lose.

Gamestop will never reach 500 you say? Guess you have no clue then. This ran up that much without these big hedgies covering, guess what will happen if it does.

You claim the people buying this stock, are malicious. For doing what? Buying a stock that people disagree with being worth nothing, because that's what's happening here. They shorted, could have covered ages ago but wanted it down more, instead they kept fucking with the stock more and more in the hopes to bankrupt those companies.

AMC has enough money to run for at least 2 more years assuming we don't get another covid type situation. So why should this company go out of business? Because the shorters are so greedy that they want to bankrupt?

They are causing the squeeze, they overleveredged, they have kept shorting the stock with no success, and instead of covering, they are playing with money they don't have because they don't want to give up.


This is not taking advantage of a failing company, this is seeing a company at risk of failing, and doing whatever the hell you can to make sure they fail.
Even the reported numbers put them at 1/3rd of the shares on loan, and trust me those numbers are way higher. This is pure market manipulation.

\- divided between EV and ICE  
\- competition is several times larger as new companies pour into the market to get share of it  


the real growing markets when it comes to cars are large dometic markets which lack behind in vevicle saturation and population buying power: china, inda, africa, south america.

86,DD," It’s not an analogy...it’s the facts of gaming a system not designed for you to innately win. Just because it doesn’t make sense to you doesn’t mean it doesn’t make sense.

Some people firmly believe they can approach a roulette table with a strategy...that the board of numbers showing what has happened is an indicator of what will happen. That’s a fallacy.

Some picks are DD—you can’t land a 00 if one doesn’t exist on the wheel—that’s fairly obvious.

However, to think DD is the break all of strategy is ignorant; no amount of DD is going to save a stock from the nature of time and surprise.

It’s not a system of research. It’s a system of risk: act accordingly.",tekmailer,0,/r/stocks/comments/nnzuwg/consider_yourself_an_investor_imagine_the_sell/gzz4crv/,0.052,0.873,0.074,0.5719

Yes, you are wrong, and I will detail how and why you are wrong below. If you want a general idea of the full history that led up to this event there is a nice timeline going all the way to 2013 that details major events. It sounds like you know little about this event except maybe the recent rise in late 2020 and 2021. I'll give you a brief history of the most important events that you may be missing but know that the website I link below gives much more detail. Timeline of Gamestop major events since 2013: [https://gmetimeline.com/](https://gmetimeline.com/)

**Overall:**

A rise in the stock's price to $20 and even $40 in 2021 was very predictable. Anything higher you can quite easily argue is future prospect speculation+media+retail. I will not debate that.

**2016-2020:**

**Bear thesis:**

Gamestop has been struggling with losing sales to Amazon, and online/digital video game purchases. Their cash flow and profits decrease each year until 2020 when they actually began to have losses instead of profits.

**Bull thesis:**

Other than used game sales, Gamestop makes the most revenue, profits, and has the highest margins on new gaming consoles. New consoles (Xbox+Playstation) are being released in late 2020 which will cause a large rise in Gamestop's downtrending profits. Additionally, the new consoles will still have slots for physical games which Microsoft and Sony point out: ""Customers still want to physically own games. A lot has gone digital but people still want to physically own their favorites.""

Melvin Capital continuously profits by buying tens of millions of $ worth of Put contracts on Gamestop--betting the stock will decrease in value. They are also shorting the stock but by how much ($1 mil, $50 mil?) nobody really knows because short positions are not required to be reported. One of the largest bets is that Gamestop will not be able to payoff its bonds that are coming due in Q1 of 2021. Failure to pay those bonds would result in bankruptcy.

**Late 2018:**

Dr. Burry invested $7 million into Gamestop paying an average of $10-$15 per share. This is public knowledge anyone can find on his firm's 13f filing. This draws attention as Dr. Burry predicted the housing market bubble in 2008 which very few others saw coming and thought he was insane to bet on but profited his firm millions.

**2019:**

* Dr. Burry increases his stake in GME over the course of the year by \~$20 million and urges the company to do a stock buyback while the shares were under $4.
* Gamestop buys back \~$115 mil worth of stock are \~$5. Melvin Capital continues to buy increasing amounts of Puts.
* DFV posts that he spent $50,000 in stock and call options GME to the WSB subreddit. His post is ridiculed with comments such as ""You bought calls on a company that is almost totally irrelevant in the gaming industry and that conducts most of their business in store."" He continues to provide monthly updates on his position; none of his posts receive more than 100 upvotes and people keep telling him to cash out with the gains he already made.

**2020:**

* The Pandemic hits; Gamestop remains open as they have claimed they are an essential business that can provide hardware for employees working from home.
* Gamestop hits a new low of $2.57 a share.
* Dr. Burry buys another $10 mil of stock--he later then takes some profits by selling \~$15 mil of shares when Gamestop returns to $5.
* Melvin Capital continues to buy million of $ worth of puts.
* GME's 6.75% bonds that were due in 2021 are successfully converted to 10% bonds due 2023. This buys them time (at a higher interest rate) to return to profitability and almost eliminates any possibility of bankruptcy in 2021. Uh oh, looks like the original bear thesis is no longer holding...
* Ryan Cohen, founder of Chewy.com (online pet retailer worth \~$30 bil), buys \~10% of the outstanding GME shares and claims he can transform it into a more digital store.
* Cohen buys another 3% of the outstanding shares later the same year.
* Dr. Burry takes some more profits, selling around half his stake around $10, and closing out the position entirely when Gamestop nears $20 per share.
* Gamestop closes \~500 of their least profitable stores.
* Melvin Capital doubles down on their Put position (and perhaps their short position but again this is speculation).

**Late 2020-2021:**

The media madness, WSB craziness, tweets from celebrities, retail investing, trade halting, cause a massive short squeeze and large 'cult following' for GME among other stocks that squeezed up during the same event (such as AMC, among others). A lot of this is hype but has actually driven more customers and attention to Gamestop than could have ever been predicted years prior. 

Anytime I buy something gaming related I now look to see if I can do it through Gamestop first rather than Amazon or digitally (via Steam/Nintendo/etc.). I have spent over $500 there in 2021 which, if not for these crazy events, I would have spent $0 there this year. Many others have done the same.",samnater,1,/r/stocks/comments/nnzuwg/consider_yourself_an_investor_imagine_the_sell/h003s44/,0.052,0.824,0.125,0.9963

Start to think more in terms of allocations, e.g. 'I will be 5% TSLA'. That ways if TSLA runs up massively, you should sell some to rebalance your portfolio, but you still keep open interest. You're not going to worry about exact prices any more, and just be happy to have your money 'in the right places'. Then just sit back and let it play out.

Some people prefer a more active approach but for me it causes too much stress and costs too many fees to be constantly chopping and changing. Very few people are going to outperform the market over their career. You never truly know if you are outperforming, or underperforming, or just having good/bad fortune.

I'll buy 4 calls if it shoots up 50% I'll sell 3 and let the last one ride bc it's a runner.

Or I'll buy 10 on something low volatility high liquidity and if it hits 10% I'll sell 9 and let one ride or sell all 10 and take the profit.

I've missed some big gains doing this, UPS Q2 2020 still haunts me, but I didn't lose money either. And honestly if something rockets up 50% profit I'll usually cash out.

Just gotta pick your poison and trust your research. If you're expecting a catalyst might be ok to hold or maybe you need to hedge in case that catalyst is a flop or it never comes.

Don't forget to reset your thinking on a play from time to time. Start at the beginning and analyze why you're in it. Stay nimble and set your stop losses accordingly.",whatisliquidity,1,/r/stocks/comments/nnx710/what_is_your_usual_im_out_percentage_gain_on_calls/gzzl40z/,0.125,0.758,0.117,0.1497

162,AMC," Stop being emotional and dreaming. Sociopaths for the win.

Talking about the topic, when markets go off the book, they go off your books. Being adaptive is the most profitable thing around, doesnt matter if it's out right false or stupid by the books, or everyone will downvote you, making money is only thing that matters.

So when everyone is screaming end of the world in 2020, people that invested are very well off.

When everyone is pumping gme and AMC with the most stupid, false, cult like info possible, your only question should be can you adapt and make money off it.

I made tons of money because some black guy died in America and various companies like body cam companies and black owned businesses pumped beyond reason. Don't think about politics and morality, adapt to whatever crap is happening.

For example Apple and tesla been pumping past years like mad, time after time, people been saying for years fuck etf, books, everything just yeet your portfolio in apple, the fucking thing Warren buffet even did while quoting following the books to his followers. I got in late and both of these doubled my money in few years.

If you are going to pick individual stocks, stop dreaming, stop being emotional, don't get married to anything, be adaptive, see what works these days and go with it. Past years wasn't the place to cite the books on tesla company, past year was the place to own it as it pumps and pumps and pumps and pumps. I even got position right after it got included in Spy index, easiest 35% of my life, and that is ridiculous % of money to make in short term.

163,DD," If you really couldnt care less about stocks and finance and just want a higher yield than a savings account then an ETF is good. 

In my personal opinion, ETFs are a bit of a surrender to the idea that everything in life is a crapshoot, in which case you might as well diversify as much as possible. But this is also setting you up for mediocre performance. I don't think everything is a crapshoot and I think that there are companies/investments that are better than others, so I pick stocks. There are some talks online by Peter Thiel about this idea of ""you're not a lottery ticket"" if you're interested.

164,EDIT," This is just flat out hilariously wrong. They're not a majority no and I don't intend on arguing that but arguing in absolutes like this is just straight unfactual and hilariously easy to disprove your claims. If you want me to jest a little then, well, Warren Buffet and Berkshire Hathaway exists. His existence alone disproves this claim. Jokes aside though lets look at some actual data:

[Data on the topic does not find the absolute results you're claiming.](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/spiva/#/reports) They don't find that no institutional investors **ever** beat the market.

Retail investors also actually tend to beat the market at better rates than professional investors do. [Here's some data on RH investors over the last few years for instance](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/robinhood-investors-are-beating-the-stock-market-and-heres-the-data-that-proves-it-2020-08-06). I've read some articles that suggest insider information limits institutional investors and retail doesn't have such blocks as a possible explanation and I personally think retail's lack of knowledge of and access to more complex and higher risk investing strategies can be a contributing factor too.

TL;DR: You can be right that most don't succeed and I won't argue with you there but it's laughably hilariously wrong to walk in trying to claim that no one ever beats the market long term or that rewards in stock picking can't be worth it.

EDIT: Also side note on your luck comment, yes luck does have some role to play(Markets are irrational) but it seems to me you don't understand a lot of the fundamental analysis behind the businesses being invested in that fuels intelligent long term stock picking.

169,CW," I am pretty much in this same position and agree with this.

I think the new company will be well positioned in the streaming wars. This marketplace is ripe for consolidation, because consumers only have an appetite for buying into a few services, yet want access to wide types of content. Companies that can provide a large variety of content will do well at attracting consumers.

Bundled products will also do a good job of getting a few extra dollars/month from consumers on the monthly premium. What I am not sure about yet is how well these companies can offer tiered services successfully in a consolidated market with 3 or 4 main players. This will be key for making sure they can get consumers willing to pay more, to pay more, while marketing cheaper rates to the masses. It will be interesting to see how they market HBO.

Together this company will also have good negotiating power with existing with existing cable services in agreements to carry their channels and they will have substantial access to broadcast television via CBS and CW. It is possible, they might actually have the power to change how existing cable services operate and have some sort of streaming app integration.

Their media properties will include: Warner Bros. Film, DC Entertainment, HBO, Cinemax, TBS, TNT, TruTV, Cartoon Network, TCM, Boomerand, ViacomCBS, CNN, Turner Sports, and 50% of the CW Network, Food Network, HGTV, Travel Channel, Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, Science Channel, TLC, 14 other smaller cable channels, and other media rights.

As for T, post spinoff, they need to invest more in the 5G network. If they don't, they will be be exposed to losing consumers to competition.  What I'm still not sure about/curious about, is if the widescale 5G adoption can lead to more revenue by consumers wanting to directly connect more devices (ie. watches, cars, tracking, laptops, industrial uses \[logistics tracking, delivery vehicles, watching after remote employees, etc..\]).

This will be key in whether AT&T is just upgrading their networks to maintain customers or whether the investment can actually lead to sizeable increases in revenue for the money they put into the new network.

I don't believe we know the answers to this question yet. Most of the 5G network so far are the low-bands, which is closer to being an upgrade of existing 4G infrastructure and can work over larger distances. It is the mid and high bands that will offer the high speeds, higher device loads, and more overall bandwidth over shorter areas that still needs to largely be constructed. It is also this latter part of the 5G network that might open up more uses and more consumers beyond smartphones.",cwdawg15,6,/r/stocks/comments/no30wq/better_buy_att_or_discovery_for_future_company/gzybsfu/,0.035,0.891,0.074,0.956

214,TD," More or less. Depending on what level of options you were approved for, it’s likely you will only be able to sell cash secured puts (CSPs) meaning that you will need to have enough cash to cover the purchase of 100 shares if it got exercised.

Ex: you think XYZ, currently at $50, will go up or trade sideways, but you’d be willing to buy at $45. You deposit, raise, or otherwise have $4,500 of free cash to trade.

You sell the put at a $45 strike and collect the premium. Your “cash available” will now decrease by $4,500 because they basically pull it aside and earmark it in case the option exercises (similar to how you have to have enough cash in your bank account to get a cashiers check and then your account decreases immediately by the amount of the cashiers check).

If it doesn’t decline lower than $45, the option expires worthless, you keep the premium, and the $4,500 shows back up as available.

If it gets exercised, you keep the premium, and get 100 shares of the XYZ at $45/share and they use the $4,500 they “set aside” to fund the purchase of the shares.

One thing you can do at TD is open Think or Swim and you should see PaperTrade, as an option, and there you can practice buying and selling the options with fake money to make sure that the way you enter them, your strategies, etc. are what you think they are before potentially making a mistake and losing real money.",NativeTxn7,2,/r/stocks/comments/noh2ut/basic_bitch_questions_about_selling_options/gzzzq1y/,0.068,0.867,0.065,-0.4019
215,DTE," A couple of details are not quite correct. You cash the premium the moment you sell any contract. 
Selling CCs if you are bearish is a recipe for losses: CCs work well with a stock stable (but with IV still high) and with a stock rising. You would simply choose your strike price to rinse and repeat. I prefer to stay close in terms of DTE, so that I have ample margin to roll up and out if I want to keep the stock.
CSPs work well in the scenario you mention, but if you go OTM, you can tolerate moderate drops as well.

253,AMD," Agree - holding them and increasing positions will eat some of those commissions a bit. 

So purchasing say an extra 8 shares of AMD with the fees again has a better return than being sat on two shares. So AMD is priced at 80 dollars, owning two shares at that price is 160, but you need to earn back 20 dollars worth of commission to break even, so you would want about 14 per cent increase on that price to make back the fees.

Buy an extra 8 shares however at 80 you then own 10 shares at 800, needing to earn back two lots of commission fees at 40 dollars. So you would therefore require an increase of 5 per cent opposed to 14.

There is a selling fee so it’s the same buying fee and exchange rate but long hold so can if plausible switch providers to one that lets you sell for a lower fee 30 years away from the current purchases.",Maximum-Fudge6438,1,/r/stocks/comments/no6pc3/is_one_share_of_amzn_arguably_better_than_6/gzz0o62/,0.016,0.843,0.141,0.9468

293,AMD," It’s a good point you make, just said to one other poster it might actually make more sense to increase the smaller positions due to fees. So 2 AMD at 80 with the fees included works at about an increase of 14 per cent to break even.

Buy an extra 8 priced at 80 for 800 worth, yes there’s a second batch of fees but to earn back the fees and gain on the stock it would only need to increase by 5 per cent not 14.

Also if you’re constantly checking your watch they will ban that too. Don’t ruin it for everyone else. Market open is the worst time to look at the market unless you’re swing trading or something anyway.

298,IRS," That's perfectly normal. The company you transfer to has no idea what your cost basis is or what the purchase date was. You should be able to update it in the site or the app, or with customer service.

But even if not, it doesn't matter. You report the real cost basis to the IRS (or your country's tax authority). Just make sure you have the paperwork to back it up.

I'm old enough to remember when brokers didn't track your cost basis at all, it was up to you to go through your past statements and report the right thing to the IRS.",irresponsible_owl,12,/r/stocks/comments/nodcic/confused_and_annoyed/gzzeuy2/,0.015,0.924,0.061,0.6164
