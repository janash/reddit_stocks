I knew it was overvalued at $4 but I thought it could reach $6 EOW. Stupid me lost $4k of profits.. Then I saw it slowly bleed down and my profits going down and down to the point I was in the red.

58,PT," There a loads of sites that provide analysis on stocks. You shouldn’t be extremely trusting on them but you can compare the consensus between them. I use quite a bit of sites to validate my decision. For example. My weekend plays, I find stocks with coming catalysts on a Monday. Then vet those stocks for the risk factor. Obviously you can’t be 100% sure but you can still make a good pick on this. I look for buy ratings usually I add ones that have 2 or more buy ratings, the company needs to be rated B or higher. I review their catalyst history and how it performs before and after the previous catalysts. I see the PT for the year. If it’s close to its lowest PT target already then it’s off my list. I check the volume days before Friday and make my decision in 1 or 2 stocks to watch Friday. The one with a better float and overall performance with good volume is the one I will look for an entry on Friday. Then come Monday before or after the catalyst if it’s premarket. I will sell for a 10%-25% profit 90% of the time. You can get lucky and the catalyst makes it run up and you get more gains, but never bet on this happening.

I didn’t get back on Reddit till the GME hype as I was blissfully unaware there were wonderful helpful veterans like yourself who “love” to help the smaller traders.

I made the first comment on the main AGTC DD about a month ago and I'll abbreviate it here, once again. The insanely high PTs are based on Sanofi buyout rumors. AGTC is a great company with great value, but $10+/share for a company offering a not-unique gene therapy technique that focuses on rare genetic diseases = not profitable long term. Hell, they're not profitable until at least 2023! The sole long-term value in this company lies in a buyout, pharma wants their gene therapy technology. AGTC has nothing else to offer.

That said, I re-bought the dip today after selling my initial stake last week, solely based on how much these subs and their lemmings hype it.

110,PT," This is definitely not a p & d, or a swing trade imo. 
 The company is ridiculously stacked with talent. The best of the best in their respective positions. The strategic moves they have made to get to where they are, give me an assload of confidence. Not to mention that the product they are selling solves a very serious issue, in an untouched market ( outside of hospitals in house locks ) 
So where the PT may be $8 in April, I am invested for the long term.

Started off by selling everything I had once the market opened (seemed like a good idea at the time). I was INCREDIBLY tempted to YOLO the rest of my funds into CTRM at 9:45 when it fell back to the $0.80s. So tempted. I barely decided against it, which is a decision I’m obviously kicking myself for now.

From this, I learned a few things.

* I should be more aggressive with my trades. When I’m tempted to do something, do it. I’ve passed so much money up due to my cowardice

* I shouldn’t be trading in the first place

* You should do the exact opposite of what I do for some easy money

I bought about every AGTC dip this week to lower my cost average, and ended up way deeper than I ever intended. I started selling off shares when it recovered, but I sold at a loss. I sold about 25% of my position.

If AGTC were to plummet below $5 again, I’d be tempted to buy more with the buying power from selling shares around $5.60.

420,DD," Trailing stop losses are a blessing automation tool provided by brokers, they can help you secure profits while you sleep in case the market bleeds or crashes, allowing you to buy back in the next morning at a cheaper price ( provided the stock kept crashing).

You're gambling on whether or not the stock will continue to crash, with the hectic volatility as of late I'd recommend using it. Percentages etc I suggest you play with it yourself and find your own strategy! What works for me might not work for you. Dpeending on the scenario, if I truly believe in my DD of a stock I'll set the trailing loss really high at 20%, and if it drops below that for some reason unrelated to the company itself (overall market crash etc.) I'll just buy back in lower. If I'm at a profit of 200% or so and the market nearly closes, I'll set a stop loss of 10%. If the stock shoots up that trailing price gets updated to 10% of the highest price it hit.

432,CCIV," I was originally very bullish on CCIV (11 shares at $17) 


When it dropped 30% in AH after the merger was announced, I thought that was it. I also though $40 and $30 would each be the resistance point too...

However, I do think that people are misinterpreting the information (like on average, PIPE investment shares are typically sold at a 6% discount. However, LUCID’s PIPE was sold at a 50% premium). I don’t think people are understanding that this alone is unheard of. But I think the price crashing is scaring people into thinking $15 is a FMV per share.

Not sure if it’ll level off after this week, but long term I would not worry about it.
