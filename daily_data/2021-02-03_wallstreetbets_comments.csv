More people can afford to jump in and be apart of this. There was a lot more trading volume today than yesterday and supposedly more buys than sells.

34,GME," My uneducated guess and probably based on hope is that the process so far has developed as it follows: 

1. The HF shorted GME predicting an inevitable bankruptcy due to COVID19
2. Some educated retards from WSB of the likes of DeepFuckingValue who’ve been studying and daydreaming of this type of situations saw the opportunity and raised awareness. It also happened that GME is a gaming asset with deep emotional ties for a major part of the whole Reddit community. Add to that the support of some VERY well know and respected figures 📷📷📷 which happened to have a lot of hate for HF shorting his business and a huge snowball formed while the HF were hoping for the hype to wear off
3. The hype never wore off and an emergency plan was executed. Maybe the HF had it in their protocols for years, maybe they just had to improvise. Whatever it was they came up with THIS plan: 0) Delay covering the stocks shorted A) Short the stock again at 400$ B) Ask brokers to cut demand while artificially driving down the price of stocks with ladder attacks. C) Ask brokers to force stop losses on assets D) Buy those assets automatically beeing sent back into the system to cover the stocks shorted at 400$

This leads us to tue current situation where:

1. They still have to cover for the stocks shorted at 4$
2. They recovered some of the billions they will lose covering thise shorts by shorting at 400$ and covering at 100$
3. They cleaned the system of all the paper hands eho puechased during the hype.
4. Now there will be comolete and absolute silence as if everything has passed and everything is lost
5. They keep buying back stock at a rate where the market allows for the price to stay steady, buying from those who tyink it is game over.
6. When the final deadline will arrive, they will stomp to buy what’s left to cover.

The best plan they could come up with to avoid total bancrupcy for Wall Street.

It's dropping because they are opening new shorts (borrowing shares then selling) and this puts downward pressure on the stock. They are short ladder attacking.

The latest trade gets updated and it looks like the price is falling, but it's really just two dudes being idiots. They are trying to create FAKE volume in order to scare people to sell, creating REAL volume.

The sad thing is, it probably worked a bit today. The other thing is, myself and many others BOUGHT MORE. Why? BECAUSE THEY ARE STILL WAY OVERSHORTED.

Also, don't discount the fact that the whole fucking world came together to save gamestop, and there is massive ""social citizen"" collatoral that Gamestop has gained in this massive event.

There were memes about Ninja turtles growing up and taking care of their old pal Splinter, and those memes are real. The world has got gamestop and we will help it recover.

Why does this matter? Because it's VERY LIKELY that $100 share price is very very good entry point, not just to fight the over-shorted stock, but also simply as a long term hold.

These prices just make it easier to go long on GME, and that actually being a smart play.

65,GME," How the fuck is $100 a good entry point for a long term hold? Sure I understand buying this as a BET or gamble, but if you honestly think this company should be valued at $100 and is poised to grow in the long term then you really don’t understand business or finance. What possible metric would suggest to you that GameStop should be valued higher than the rest of the market by an insane margin? They are losing money and their revenue is shrinking. They have tons of debt as well. Honestly they will probably go bankrupt at some point realistically.

I’m all for sticking it to reckless hedge funds but to say that GME is a good long term hold, let alone that $100 is a good entry point, just shows you are very unfamiliar with the stock market and finance in general.

74,GME," This isn’t the confirmation bias everyone is looking for, but two possibilities I can see, and I’d guess it’s a combination of both:

1. The current remaining shorts sold at $100+, and they’re already in the money and they think it’ll dip more before they cover. 

2. The current remaining underwater shorts managed to not get margin called during last week’s spike, and they think they can ride it out until the price settles even lower. 

Your post implies it’s a done deal that GME is going to hit $300+ again. Why? Because everyone on r/wsb says “TO THE MOOOOINNNNNN!!!2!!2!!2!” and put rocket emojis next to it?

The truth is, we don’t know exactly what the current short interest is, and won’t until the Jan 31 data are released next week. The current Ortex estimate is 27M shares, but that’s just an estimate. Here’s what we do know. On the last official report (Jan 15), short interest was just shy of 62 million shares. The volume in GME today alone was 78 million shares. The peak daily volume was 197 million shares traded, on Jan 22. That is absolutely insane volume for a stock which up until January had an average daily volume of around 10M. And while we’re at it, “days to cover” doesn’t mean it will take the shorts that many days to unwind their positions. Seriously, the amount of times I’ve seen someone say “hurrrrr, Melvin can’t have covered, it’s going to take the six days!!!” is off the charts. Remember that line in The Big Short about how Wall Street likes to use complicated terms to make you feel stupid or bored and that only they can do what they do? Days to Cover is one of those terms. It’s nothing but the ratio of short interest to the average daily volume. So guess what: if the volume goes up, DtC goes down. With the volume hitting up to 20x the historical average, it’s anybody’s guess which shorts covered and which didn’t.

No, it isn't. The [15 Jan SI (Short Interest) was 121.07%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gme).

I would guess that the shortsales are all the way down. I would guess that the ladder attacks were done with short selling because might as well profit on the way down (this would then explain how we went from 121% on 15 Jan to 226% - though I have no clue how up to date finra's info is).

Once people have moved from RH to brokers with more liquidity, I would guess that we will see the current trend reverse. There has functionally been a stop on buys up to this point due to RH, WeBull, eToro, etc. having issues putting up cash for clearinghouses (and engaging in general fuckery).

214,GME," My uneducated guess and probably based on hope is that the process so far has developed as it follows: 

1. The HF shorted GME predicting an inevitable bankruptcy due to COVID19
2. Some educated retards from WSB of the likes of DeepFuckingValue who’ve been studying and daydreaming of this type of situations saw the opportunity and raised awareness. It also happened that GME is a gaming asset with deep emotional ties for a major part of the whole Reddit community. Add to that the support of some VERY well know and respected figures 📷📷📷 which happened to have a lot of hate for HF shorting his business and a huge snowball formed while the HF were hoping for the hype to wear off
3. The hype never wore off and an emergency plan was executed. Maybe the HF had it in their protocols for years, maybe they just had to improvise. Whatever it was they came up with THIS plan: 0) Delay covering the stocks shorted A) Short the stock again at 400$ B) Ask brokers to cut demand while artificially driving down the price of stocks with ladder attacks. C) Ask brokers to force stop losses on assets D) Buy those assets automatically beeing sent back into the system to cover the stocks shorted at 400$

This leads us to tue current situation where:

1. They still have to cover for the stocks shorted at 4$
2. They recovered some of the billions they will lose covering thise shorts by shorting at 400$ and covering at 100$
3. They cleaned the system of all the paper hands eho puechased during the hype.
4. Now there will be comolete and absolute silence as if everything has passed and everything is lost
5. They keep buying back stock at a rate where the market allows for the price to stay steady, buying from those who tyink it is game over.
6. When the final deadline will arrive, they will stomp to buy what’s left to cover.

The best plan they could come up with to avoid total bancrupcy for Wall Street.

I'm retarded monkey yada yada yada . This is not financial advice yada yada yada. please read

I have been putting a lot of thought into this situation. And also putting in a lot of research. I'm holding gme and AMC. I have skin in the game.

What I'm about to write is a combination of things that were suggested by Mark Cuban and what I've learned about all of our brokerage accounts.

In the AMA with Mark Cuban and before that he mentioned that we could trigger the mother of all short squeezes if we were to recall all of our lent shares. However, how does one recall all of their lent shares?

this is where my research uncovered some really heinous realities that we all may be victims of. Apparently, the reason that we are able to trade for free in most of the platforms that offer free trades is because they are given permission to lend our shares as a way of generating revenue in order to give us that ability.

So what do we do? At the very least we need to be raising hell and reaching out to our brokerages to try to see if there's any way to force them to recall our shares. More complicated is to open up the discussion of which brokerages have the ability to lend our shares written into their terms and conditions in a way that we the retail investor normally don't pay attention to.

We also need to open up a discussion about whether or not it's really in our best interest to be using brokerages that provide free trading if that comes at the consequence of us having our shares lent out without our authorization.

Another thing that I learned while trying to figure out what's going on, is that because most of these brokerages are able to lend out our shares they're lending them to the short sellers which is creating a feedback loop. They are essentially always going to have an interest in feeding the short sellers agenda by giving them the shares in order to generate revenue. This means that any one of our brokerages right now could actually be helping to drive the price down while simultaneously holding us hostage as the place to buy shares.

 From what I can assess thus far we have a couple of different ways that we can trigger a short squeeze.

1. We need to find a way to get all of our lent shares recalled en-Mass from all of our brokerages. Again I'm repeating Mark Cuban's idea he said we need to get our lent shares recalled.

2. We need to control our purchase volume. I'm in complete agreement with the concept of buying dips. but one thing that we're losing in this war is the momentum that we carried at the beginning. Mark Cuban also referenced this idea of momentum.

 In the first days we were able to Garner support from a huge audience of retail investors. All of those investors came together to purchase shares on the same initial days. It was this momentum and the increase in volume on those trading days they caused the buying power to fundamentally shift the valuation of the trade throughout those days. Although buying a few shares here and there has been helping us maintain a stability, it has not been possible to generate The surge and volume that we need to truly take this to the Moon.

Another way of thinking about it is this. If we hold all of the shares but we can't generate a reason for there to be a surge in buying either from the short sellers or other retail investors, we cannot restart the momentum necessary to cause the algorithms to start increasing the value again.

If we're going to treat this like a war we need to think strategically about how each of these battles is playing out. They are trying to divide and conquer us. They know some people will leave the battle or simply die. They do not care. We do need to stand together but we need to do it in a way that generates the most effective results.

 It is critical that we figure out a way if we're going to really have this ship take off again.

I'm doing my best to understand all of the different information that everybody's presenting to justify the pros and the cons of everything that's happening. Regardless of all of the things that are being used to take energy away from this movement. I still believe all of the right things are in place to trigger another squeeze. We simply have to figure out a way to make them ""stop lending our shares!"" I repeat, we must get her shares back. If the shorts are the ones holding those shares, and we strip them out of their blood-stained hands then we can force them to buy them back. This is the way.

Please do your due diligence. Look up the way brokerages that offer free trades generate revenue. It will show you exactly what I'm talking about. Most of us got sucked into free trading because free trading is great. However, in a situation like this there are consequences that I don't think any of us have calculated. Even if we have to waste another week and transfer to a brokerage that simply cannot or will not lend our shares it is critical that we find a way to use one of those brokerages.

And I hate to sound like a bot by repeating myself, but we have to do everything in our power to make our brokerages stop lending our shares and to recall all of the shares that have been Lent.

Edit: to everyone who's given me up votes and karma thank you.

Edit: Two other important research points are worth mentioning. The first is that when we recall our shares from the shorts it causes the interest rate that the shorts are paying to increase. If we create a situation where they're interest rates are increasing they're going to be forced to buy back the shares from us sooner at higher prices. Again, this requires that we find a way to get our brokers to stop lending out her shares and to recall them.

Edit: this next idea, the second idea, relates to my comments about momentum and volume. But let's think of this as a series of questions. 

When are short sellers most likely to be hurt by changes in price?  I would argue that Thursday... and/or Friday are the most critical days. Friday is arguably more important than Thursday.

What if instead of all of us buying intermittently, we were instead to allow them to drive the price down during the week thereby giving us the best possible discount?

What if by allowing ourselves to receive the best possible discount, we were to feel more motivated to all buy more shares on the day that their contracts expired?

Could we buy driving up the volume so much on those days increase the price far beyond their strike price at each and every one of their expirations?

If we succeed at driving up the price at each and every one of the short expiration days, how much more quickly will they be forced to find a way to either cover or risk bleeding out and dying?

We need momentum in volume, we need everybody to stay together.  Rather than allowing them to beat us because we missed a simple angle that actually gave us an advantage, what would happen if we tried to be strategic and take control of this war?


Please help get this in front of as many eyes as possible. I don't think that my Reddit karma will get me there.

270,GME," I just really don't believe that the hedge fund shorts at the bottom who ran the short interest up in 2019-2020 to 140% when they were shorting around $5 suddenly escaped when the price was already in the hundreds. Think about it, they had the entire way up to $500 when they had to illegally shut down buying the stock to avoid losing it all. Why the fuck weren't they covering during January when the stock was moving up from $17 -> $34 - $45 -> $60 -> $150, etc. ??

Something fuckin wreaks and I can't tell if it's the millions of bots who've flooded these threads to call everyone bagholders or the fact that there's still so much negative publicity being put out on Gamestop but the last few days have just felt strange to me.

If someone can just address my first paragraph I'd appreciate it, I know people are saying the hedgies covered through dark pools and that it's over and that GME is now a dead stock but I'm just really doubting that the original hedge funds covered in the past couple weeks because it wouldn't of made sense to have done it in the hundreds when they could have when Gamestop hit $20 in the fourth quarter of last year.

1. The HF shorted GME predicting an inevitable bankruptcy due to COVID19
2. Some educated retards from WSB of the likes of DeepFuckingValue who’ve been studying and daydreaming of this type of situations saw the opportunity and raised awareness. It also happened that GME is a gaming asset with deep emotional ties for a major part of the whole Reddit community. Add to that the support of some VERY well know and respected figures 📷📷📷 which happened to have a lot of hate for HF shorting his business and a huge snowball formed while the HF were hoping for the hype to wear off
3. The hype never wore off and an emergency plan was executed. Maybe the HF had it in their protocols for years, maybe they just had to improvise. Whatever it was they came up with THIS plan: 0) Delay covering the stocks shorted A) Short the stock again at 400$ B) Ask brokers to cut demand while artificially driving down the price of stocks with ladder attacks. C) Ask brokers to force stop losses on assets D) Buy those assets automatically beeing sent back into the system to cover the stocks shorted at 400$

This leads us to tue current situation where:

1. They still have to cover for the stocks shorted at 4$
2. They recovered some of the billions they will lose covering thise shorts by shorting at 400$ and covering at 100$
3. They cleaned the system of all the paper hands eho puechased during the hype.
4. Now there will be comolete and absolute silence as if everything has passed and everything is lost
5. They keep buying back stock at a rate where the market allows for the price to stay steady, buying from those who tyink it is game over.
6. When the final deadline will arrive, they will stomp to buy what’s left to cover.

299,VERY," My uneducated guess and probably based on hope is that the process so far has developed as it follows: 

1. The HF shorted GME predicting an inevitable bankruptcy due to COVID19
2. Some educated retards from WSB of the likes of DeepFuckingValue who’ve been studying and daydreaming of this type of situations saw the opportunity and raised awareness. It also happened that GME is a gaming asset with deep emotional ties for a major part of the whole Reddit community. Add to that the support of some VERY well know and respected figures 📷📷📷 which happened to have a lot of hate for HF shorting his business and a huge snowball formed while the HF were hoping for the hype to wear off
3. The hype never wore off and an emergency plan was executed. Maybe the HF had it in their protocols for years, maybe they just had to improvise. Whatever it was they came up with THIS plan: 0) Delay covering the stocks shorted A) Short the stock again at 400$ B) Ask brokers to cut demand while artificially driving down the price of stocks with ladder attacks. C) Ask brokers to force stop losses on assets D) Buy those assets automatically beeing sent back into the system to cover the stocks shorted at 400$

This leads us to tue current situation where:

1. They still have to cover for the stocks shorted at 4$
2. They recovered some of the billions they will lose covering thise shorts by shorting at 400$ and covering at 100$
3. They cleaned the system of all the paper hands eho puechased during the hype.
4. Now there will be comolete and absolute silence as if everything has passed and everything is lost
5. They keep buying back stock at a rate where the market allows for the price to stay steady, buying from those who tyink it is game over.

356,FOR," For #AMC holders/baggers...

What’s about to happen is trick the system, it is illegal but you stand to lose a couple million in a lawsuit vs billions in your bad shorting stocks. 

The hedge fund hatches a plan. Market markers and hedgefund friends are going to use stocks that they own and trade them very very quickly with each other at low low prices. The supply is still low, they are only trading a couple hundred or thousand stocks, but the system can’t recognize that its the same stocks being traded. Its just seeing the amount of times the same stock is being traded. So one stock being moved 5 times the system, sees as 5 different stocks, and therefore think the supply is high. 

Thing is, this only drives the price down. It doesn’t matter though, since you as someone who is holding isn’t selling at that price. It doesn’t matter what the price is at if no one is selling. See, the price decrease because the same stocks are being traded constantly tricking the system into thinking its multiple stocks being traded once, however since the price is too low for the people who are holding the other stocks they are not selling. The supply is still low. 

Why is this important? It is important because the hedge funds need to buy your stocks to close their positions. They literally cannot close their shorts unless they buy your stocks. This is why you are supposed to hold your stocks, no matter how low the price is. The price is a facade, they want you to sell at a price they are setting. If you are not selling even though the price is low, they cant buy. If they can’t buy, they can’t close their shorts. If they can’t close their shorts, they’ll have to pay interest. And if the interest becomes too much, they are going to be forced to buy your stocks at whatever price you offer. This is the squeeze. 

The squeeze starts when the hedge fund can’t afford to trick the system anymore since the interest on their shorts are getting too much. They’ll have to pay whatever we ask of them. If no one sells until 1000usd, they are going to be forced to pay that. If no one sells until 10000usd, they’ll have to pay that amount instead. When they are forced to close their positions, they will flood the marketplace with orders to buy. This is going to skyrocket the stocks, and the price will keep rising until people start selling. However, if you sell during the short ladder attacks, the squeeze wont happen. The price set during the attacks isn’t the actual price. It’s the price thats tricked into the system. 

This is why you HOLD no matter how much the price goes down. If everyone holds, there is no supply and if there is no supply it doesn’t matter how low the price is SINCE THERE IS LITERALLY NO ONE FOR THE HEDGE FUNDS TO BUY FROM so they can’t close their positions, they’ll have to keep paying for the interest and at some point, they WILL have to BUY YOUR STOCKS no matter the price.",singh161798,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb8lwf/why_the_fuck_are_we_acting_like_we_lost_we_made/glti60l/,0.15,0.793,0.057,-0.9949

Literally less than zero.  Compare the volume of today's ladder attack with the one last week: it was about half.  They're literally bleeding the shares they do have to try to manipulate the price, in addition to bleeding interest at a billion a day, in addition to bleeding  money into the MSM and the hordes of bots in this sub trying to demoralize everyone and make them want to sell, in addition to bleeding money on the trades for the ladder attacks themselves.

It's dropping because they are opening new shorts (borrowing shares then selling) and this puts downward pressure on the stock. They are short ladder attacking. Think of this as 2 dudes passing shares back and forth over and over for 1 dollar less each time. The latest trade gets updated and it looks like the price is falling, but it's really just two dudes being idiots.

Also, don't discount the fact that the whole fucking world came together to save gamestop, and there is massive ""social citizen"" collatoral that Gamestop has gained in this massive event.

There were memes about Ninja turtles growing up and taking care of their old pal Splinter, and those memes are real. The world has got gamestop and we will help it recover.

Why does this matter? Because it's VERY LIKELY that $100 share price is very very good entry point, not just to fight the over-shorted stock, but also simply as a long term hold.

400,REAL," People need to understand that these posts hit r/all regularly, and as much as 🚀🚀💎✋ is a funny meme, that these a-holes are still WAY oversold, and that we ain't fking selling.

It's dropping because they are opening new shorts (borrowing shares then selling) and this puts downward pressure on the stock. They are short ladder attacking. Think of this as 2 dudes passing shares back and forth over and over for 1 dollar less each time. The latest trade gets updated and it looks like the price is falling, but it's really just two dudes being idiots. They are trying to create FAKE volume in order to scare people to sell, creating REAL volume.

The sad thing is, it probably worked a bit today. The other thing is, myself and many others BOUGHT MORE. Why? BECAUSE THEY ARE STILL WAY OVERSHORTED.

Also, don't discount the fact that the whole fucking world came together to save gamestop, and there is massive ""social citizen"" collatoral that Gamestop has gained in this massive event. That singlehandedly means that any smart CEO will capitalize on this and turn Gamestop into an e-sports giant.

There were memes about Ninja turtles growing up and taking care of their old pal Splinter, and those memes are real. The world has got gamestop and we will help it recover.

Why does this matter? Because it's VERY LIKELY that $100 share price is very very good entry point, not just to fight the over-shorted stock, but also simply as a long term hold.

406,GME," Cant find the comment I was talking about.  It was a link to Ihor's twitter.  Im sure you can find the tweet on there.

Essentially S3 invented the ""S3 short interest"" which includes synthetic longs.  S3 was only reporting this proprietary metric and it confused a lot of people.  So it looks like when the synthetic longs are taken into account short interest plummeted.

I would love an explanation of how these synthetic longs come into play.  I know they are not an actual close of a short because they are also derivatives contracts.  

My retard understanding is that synthetic longs are an ATM call + ATM put which creates a position that emulates an actual stock share.  I think the hedgies covered with these on Friday because they can cover shorts for just the cost of the premium on the options instead of buying the shares outright.  This would explain why short interest stayed the same when ""S3 SI"" took a nosedive.

To me this means its a delay, not an actual short close.  Like they are wrapping their shitty short position in an even more leveraged instrument.  Now that GME has gone down, the call they bought is worthless and they owe a lot on the short they sold.

My guess is that their play is going to be to use the synthetic longs to delay until they can suppress the stock price a ton and wait for the meme hype to die down.  Then they are only fighting the diamond hands.  Pretty smart move.  The fortune they lost on the synthetic shorts will recover when the stock price moves up from them actually buying out stocks.

I think Ill make a post about this and see what everyone else thinks.",PuWahWah9,49,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb8lwf/why_the_fuck_are_we_acting_like_we_lost_we_made/glt92as/,0.088,0.787,0.125,0.8768

SO long as they make it about the games and tournaments and players and very little to no sexual content. Can you imagine if they started running online e-sports tournaments? They could crowdsource some of the prize pools and even chip in a little bit of money themselves to boost up the prize pool pot to entice big teams to partake in the tourney.

GameStop obviously needs to transform their business model, but we know they're taking steps to do that and we know their e-commerce revenues are growing by a lot.

GameStop at $90 is a 1.27 price/sales ratio. Chewy at 100 is north of 6 on that same metric. Once GameStop cuts their loss leaders (underperforming retail locations in dead malls and such), it begins to look much more like a value play given the low float and potential for immense growth within a couple years.

491,DD," Yep, I think it's a good indication of how they intend to take the company. 

They'll likely establish a web service arm that focuses on providing competitively priced hosting to generate income. 

Establish a streaming service for gamers that can rival Twitch. They can avoid Microsoft's mistakes with Mixer by not overpaying for talent - rather hosting tournaments with cash prizes that require streaming on the service to qualify + aggressive affiliate marketing programs for web services, gamestop products and advertising revenue. This will bring in the next generation of streamers while also drawing in some of the old ones. They can then expand outside of gaming to target Youtube content creators dissatisfied with some more restricted areas and monetize that content for a more mature audience.

That effectively gives them three means of making more money + the PC building plans.

This has *serious* long term potential.

They're likely investing into establishing their own web services (cloud storage, hosting, etc) similar to Amazon - as they branch out into esports and create their own streaming service to rival Twitch.

reposting a previous comment:

There's a hunger in the streaming community for an alternative to Twitch - the community dislikes the random rule enforcement and favoritism shown to certain creators who essentially use the platform to further their sex-work side hustle. Microsoft tried it with Mixer but failed because they overpaid for idiots like Ninja expecting an audience. By pivoting to esports and hosting tournaments which require using their streaming platform to qualify and compete for cash prizes, they can capitalize on picking up and establishing new up and coming streamers as well as pull/entice existing talent without offering ludicrous contracts. Offering aggressive affiliate marketing opportunities to streamers who join and push gamestop products would also entice more content creators to join. They can also sell advertising space in streams as well. Once that is established as a viable threat to Twitch, they could position themselves further to capture content creators from Youtube as well who are currently unhappy with how Google and Youtube treat their content (allowing them to branching out a little further than just games).

Gamestop has brand awareness and digital only game consoles are still at least 5-10 years away due to a variety of limitations that prevent fully abandoning disc-consoles (some of which are outside of Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo's control - such as data caps from shitty ISPs like Comcast as well as a lack of universal access to fiber optic internet speeds). That, coupled with with the limitations of the hardware's internal storage (e.g. PS5 has the same amount of storage for digital and disc console - but next gen games range from 45 to 250 GB) and the size of next gen games, preserves the retail 2nd hand market.

They're likely investing into establishing their own web services (cloud storage, hosting, etc) similar to Amazon - as they branch out into esports and create their own streaming service to rival Twitch.

There's a hunger in the streaming community for an alternative to Twitch - the community dislikes the random rule enforcement and favoritism shown to certain creators who essentially use the platform to further their sex-work side hustle. Microsoft tried it with Mixer but failed because they overpaid for idiots like Ninja expecting an audience. By pivoting to esports and hosting tournaments which require using their streaming platform to qualify and compete for cash prizes, they can capitalize on picking up and establishing new up and coming streamers as well as pull/entice existing talent without offering ludicrous contracts. Offering aggressive affiliate marketing opportunities to streamers who join and push gamestop products would also entice more content creators to join. They can also sell advertising space in streams as well. Once that is established as a viable threat to Twitch, they could position themselves further to capture content creators from Youtube as well who are currently unhappy with how Google and Youtube treat their content (allowing them to branching out a little further than just games).

Gamestop has brand awareness and digital only game consoles are still at least 5-10 years away due to a variety of limitations that prevent fully abandoning disc-consoles (some of which are outside of Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo's control - such as data caps from shitty ISPs like Comcast as well as a lack of universal access to fiber optic internet speeds).

503,AMC," If they a smart, this could be so much bigger. Than long term potential, this could revolutionize the industry.

I ask you to read and consider a merger with AMC, a comment i made from another thread. 

Think bigger, think about all those empty Malls. Super Media Megaparks, anyone? 

Game lounges with movie theater tech. Like neo arcades. Streaming services, etc. Have family days, go see a movie, play and buy games, eat. Hell. Buy and play them in store. Why wait till you get home? 

Coming attractions showcase games as much as the bullshit they show. Highlight up and coming streamers. Etc. E sports.

Gamestop is half merchandising and geek / gamer shit, it would all be in one spot. Latest Marvel Blockbuster is out? People come from theater, go directly into a store that sells the appropriate merchandise. Most likely the damn lobby. (Game stop is your front end store, with the theater being primarily in the back, with a side door for the theater specifically. Concessions and kitchen connected to both with a small dinner area)

This could also lead to ultra cheap, ultra fast internet for that very purpose.

Twitch stream showcases on giant screens with Dolby surround sound and an audience?

Maybe try and get Blizzard's attention for competitive WoW / Overwatch / Starcraft?

Each local franchise can schedule ""lan party rents"" for private screen rooms etc. Try to get the E sports leagues to co sponsor tournaments for progressive competition ladders to local, regional, national, international levels. Sponsor local players to give them a chance at glory.

Push for esport ""olympics.""

Advocate for GME to focus on PC building, components, and software. (Them breaking into the digital marketplace in full)

Membership deals, for discounts, bonuses like free movie tickets or older games. Priority on ticket / game reservations.  Create birthday bonuses to really bring it home. (Remember those party reservations?)

And of course. The meme merchandising. 

Becoming the ultimate Game stop. (Like they used to be.)

Lets move to communities. Sponsored art, music, drama, and other fine arts programs to train new generations of artist to make all the cool stuff like movies, comics,  games, apps, etc. Focus on computer engineering, programming,  and computer / network security and repair, for those interested in those fields. Open up apprentice like curriculums as soon as junior high for all sorts of ""needed jobs"". Kids who stick with their commitments get rides to college.

Current employment opportunities exist by training people to create the infrastructure for these complexes. Gonna need engineers,  electricians, carpenters,  masons, IT and Security.   Managers, day employees, maintenance... teachers for all those kids...Thats a lot of jobs.

(Lots of customers too)

This would kinda rise the mall from the ashes. All the retail and food courts would want to be near the nexus of activities. Which would mean more jobs, for more money, for more people spending at the places that we all own stock at, (that we will be shopping at ourselves most likely). 

With doctor offices moving to mall spaces, even that would be centralized. Restaurants. Other venues like bars / band concert halls, would follow.


Be a true reclamation of our economy.

Again, Big.

And if you want to get really out there. Show that these sort of things will be needed on space colonies.

507,GME," It's what pushed me over the line into buying in at ~85 monday morning of last week.

I believed that and I still do, so even though I somewhat regret missing a chance to cash out big at over 500% gains i think GME is a better long term investment than people think.

1. The HF shorted GME predicting an inevitable bankruptcy due to COVID19
2. Some educated retards from WSB of the likes of DeepFuckingValue who’ve been studying and daydreaming of this type of situations saw the opportunity and raised awareness. It also happened that GME is a gaming asset with deep emotional ties for a major part of the whole Reddit community. Add to that the support of some VERY well know and respected figures 📷📷📷 which happened to have a lot of hate for HF shorting his business and a huge snowball formed while the HF were hoping for the hype to wear off
3. The hype never wore off and an emergency plan was executed. Maybe the HF had it in their protocols for years, maybe they just had to improvise. Whatever it was they came up with THIS plan: 0) Delay covering the stocks shorted A) Short the stock again at 400$ B) Ask brokers to cut demand while artificially driving down the price of stocks with ladder attacks. C) Ask brokers to force stop losses on assets D) Buy those assets automatically beeing sent back into the system to cover the stocks shorted at 400$

This leads us to tue current situation where:

1. They still have to cover for the stocks shorted at 4$
2. They recovered some of the billions they will lose covering thise shorts by shorting at 400$ and covering at 100$
3. They cleaned the system of all the paper hands eho puechased during the hype.
4. Now there will be comolete and absolute silence as if everything has passed and everything is lost
5. They keep buying back stock at a rate where the market allows for the price to stay steady, buying from those who tyink it is game over.
6. When the final deadline will arrive, they will stomp to buy what’s left to cover.

C) Ask brokers to force stop losses on assets D) Buy those assets automatically beeing sent back into the system to cover the stocks shorted at 400$

This leads us to tue current situation where:

1. They still have to cover for the stocks shorted at 4$
2. They recovered some of the billions they will lose covering thise shorts by shorting at 400$ and covering at 100$
3. They cleaned the system of all the paper hands eho puechased during the hype.
4. Now there will be comolete and absolute silence as if everything has passed and everything is lost
5. They keep buying back stock at a rate where the market allows for the price to stay steady, buying from those who tyink it is game over.
6. When the final deadline will arrive, they will stomp to buy what’s left to cover.

Newbie here. Not an expert, so please don’t consider this financial advice.

Fine print in our brokerage contract that’s never emphasized states that our brokerages are allowed to LEND out OUR shares without asking for permission. In other words, while we are holding on to our shares, they are lending it out on margin calls to the Hedge Funds who are using it in ladder attacks to drive down the pricing on AMC, GME, NOK etc. People see the prices dropping and assume the stock is tanking and sell out at fire sale prices.

AGAIN.

The hedge funds are using OUR own shares to ladder price our shares down and tank the market.

How to avoid this? IT'S EASY !!!

Put in sell orders on all your stock holdings for AMC, GME, etc. at a reasonable daily expectation (maybe 3X-4X days opening/closing). This ties up your stocks for the day and they’re not allowed to lend out YOUR stocks.

Less stocks available to the Hedgies to play with, the more the stocks stay strong and rocket.

For me this is infinitely more than extra tendies and the approval of my wife's bf. This is about joining together to show what we are capable of united. Problem is (I'm new here too but been a retard longer than lots of these supposed apes) too many people saw $15k and got boners. I dont blame those tards, but in a phalanx you need to be able to trust the next retard over. We cant do that right now. 15k gain even 500k gain I cant say I'd sell any significant portion of it. Yeah I'll sell a few for more bananas and lube for wife and her bf, but I'm in this for the principle. Cringe? Yes. True? Yes. 

I want to take my fair share of stocks off the market so to speak, so we can see the nuke hit. I did my part DFV doin his. I believe this will still go, and for some reason even with my hate of gamestop, I'm going to join in before a squeeze ever does happen. I wonder if there is any way to prove how much we collectively owned? That would let us pretty much calculate near exactly when a short would be coming, and prepare the champagne.

They scrambled when it hit 450 or whatever, but with the number of shorts (am retard, no listen) I'd say 450 isnt even close to a peak. Would it be worth 13k? No, never. Could it be VALUED at 13k on the market? Quite possibly. Squeezes always end up with an irrationally high market value, not because a company was worth it, but because those bastards are just doing loss mitigation and buying at 13k would potentially be smarter than 15, 17, etc.

I'm a real retard though. Like unironically. I toe the line, and I'm less like Opie from FG and more like Rain Man, but I'm definitely tard. Feels good to be with my own kind.

Doing the following could prove to be our best bets ever.

\* Have our tech apes work on systems for detecting false accounts / shillbotting

\* Form an official lobby to visit congress and yes you bet your ass we'll fund it with our tendies

(If you think WSB isn't already a lobby group pull your head out of your ass and realize that we got Elon Musk, Chamath, Mark Cuban, WolfoFWallst, like 50 celebrities to show us support and we bought billboards all over the country. We're literally already doing this)

\* Consider increasing the mod count to maintain consistent levels of quality for the primordial apes (old WSB folks) (I am newish and I respect their old ways)

\* Have our finance apes put together a standard criteria of what is minimal quality DD

\* Have our CSI WSB apes do work and put together an actual profile of evidence for wrongdoing by HF and MM because congress can read even less than us.

The body that raised capital requirements by factors of 10X at 3am in the morning for Robinhood (and other clearing houses, execution brokers) and stopped them in their tracks.   


Forget Robinhood, Citadel, Melvin Capital, the SEC, FINRA and other regulators. The DTCC is where we need to hit hard. They fly under the radar and like it that way.   


The CEO of the DTCC is Mike Bodson. His Twitter is @ Mike Bodson. Public information.

These last 2 weeks, especially this last week, we have all become acutely aware of the exact methodology used in order to perverse the system to tip the scales in their favor. They use terms like 'Market makers' 'Market freeze' and 'circuit breaker' to legitimize corrupt practices to the financial illiterate. What we have learned this week Is that ALMOST THE ENTIRE FICKING COUNTRY IS FINANCIALLY ILLITERATE. 


You know what WSB does a really good job of? Breaking down foreign concepts in a way that can be easily understood and processed. We have a unique ability as retards to dumb this stuff down to the people who are supposed to oversee it (our representatives). We can't expect them to hold anyone accountable if they have no fucking idea what their looking at? Do you? 


We need to establish what we, as citizens, want the game to be, and then hold our leaders accountable to try and push us in that direction.

Im not gonna fight this movement or whatever the fuck this post is calling for(cause don't want to be banned for 0 reason), but I don't really want the sub to turn into whatever the fuck you are proposing. I joined this sub to have fun yoloing with other retards, post gain/loss porn, and shoot stock tips back and forth. I did not join this sub to turn into a undercapitalized hedge fund that censors what members can and cannot promote. I'm pretty sure no one would of even heard of GME if this whole idea was in effect 1 year ago. I also am not sure if it's even legal to form an entity like this. As much as I want to believe Reddit will protect my idenentity and our anonymous status, I highly doubt that would play out well for anyone of fed intervened. Further, what's to say hedge fund spooks are not in here right now and wouldn't be a part of this new collective of 5+mil people. I don't think this is a good idea as not only will it limit the flow of ideas but also turn us into not only a target, but the very antithesis of the WSB that existed a month ago. Idk why people in here decided to let some kiddies join and turn us into a movement instead of telling them all to fuck off anytime this was proposed in anyway. None of us hated hedge funds or even short funds in past. We had different gangs(sup bear gang, bull gang, prpl gang, steel gang, mu gang, tsla gang, and all the others). That was what made this place unique. We goaded each other for our losses, celebrated our wins and basically had retarded meme fights. In less than a month it's turned into something completely different and I can't even find any posts bout anything but meme stocks. There used to be very good analysis all throughout this sub, even for meme stocks, but that has gone out the window.  I'll tell you what I have said before, people trying to change WSB into their little personal movement/hedge fund can fuck right on off. Don't ban me for being honest either.

Edit: why not create a separate sub Reddit like idk wsbhedgefund or some shit for this.

Edit 2; also please explain to me how you are planning to use this group to change rules set by financial regulators such as the ones you mentioned in your post. Give me a break. Stop trying to turn this sub into occupy 2.0.

Stop. Stop!

You law-lickers are a real one-horse pony.

Do you not realize that the collateral requirements relevant in that selloff were required by Dodd-Frank, which your kind screeched and clamored for?

The SEC has not cared to enforce the laws that *already exist* up to now, insofar as they would have meaningfully affected the large funds in this trade. How long has GME been on the threshold list? The only interference that has or will happen here is to prevent natural consequences from unfolding after the unenforced rules were blown through with impunity.  Keep putting out those small brush fires, guys, and just ignore the forest getting dryer and dryer.

Either they'll stamp you out and crush your revolt, or they'll just bail out your counterparty (maybe fairly, for example by seizing your shares via eminent domain and providing bridge loans during the hedge fund liquidations, or maybe they just pay you for the shares and give them to the funds, or maybe they broker an offering to dilute you, or maybe they just ""inject liquidity"" to the funds to directly bankroll destroying the equity of their own citizens; the more you push this the further down the list they go).

You know what would happen if they had to themselves liquidate long holdings to cover their shorts? The poors would scoop up meaningful equity in our greatest corporations. This is a unique moment in history; with ready access to the markets, a pittance of stimulus cash, and reduced spending, a correction in the overall market would be the fairest thing that could happen. This entire year when everyone was begging for scraps our government was deliberately driving up the price of equities, even as when they finally tossed you a pittance they also inflated the money supply. They shut you out, and if this unfolds as some suspect it will at least open the door a tiny crack so you can see the warm welcoming light and hear the gay laughter and smell the delicious aromas from the party they are all having, and will continue to have, without you.

Stop. Stop!

You law-lickers are a real one-horse pony.

Do you not realize that the collateral requirements relevant in that selloff were required by Dodd-Frank, which your kind screeched and clamored for?

The SEC has not cared to enforce the laws that *already exist* up to now, insofar as they would have meaningfully affected the large funds in this trade. How long has GME been on the threshold list? The only interference that has or will happen here is to prevent natural consequences from unfolding after the unenforced rules were blown through with impunity.  Keep putting out those small brush fires, guys, and just ignore the forest getting dryer and dryer.

Either they'll stamp you out and crush your revolt, or they'll just bail out your counterparty (maybe fairly, for example by seizing your shares via eminent domain and providing bridge loans during the hedge fund liquidations, or maybe they just pay you for the shares and give them to the funds, or maybe they broker an offering to dilute you, or maybe they just ""inject liquidity"" to the funds to directly bankroll destroying the equity of their own citizens; the more you push this the further down the list they go).

You know what would happen if they had to themselves liquidate long holdings to cover their shorts? The poors would scoop up meaningful equity in our greatest corporations. This is a unique moment in history; with ready access to the markets, a pittance of stimulus cash, and reduced spending, a correction in the overall market would be the fairest thing that could happen. This entire year when everyone was begging for scraps our government was deliberately driving up the price of equities, even as when they finally tossed you a pittance they also inflated the money supply. They shut you out, and if this unfolds as some suspect it will at least open the door a tiny crack so you can see the warm welcoming light and hear the gay laughter and smell the delicious aromas from the party they are all having, and will continue to have, without you.

When I was in grad school 15ish years ago I bought some Amazon stock because they not only sold textbooks cheaper than the bookstore, but they also delivered textbooks to you.  That was pretty much the extent of my DD.  I had been I school forever, textbooks were expensive and it was pain going to the bookstore, most people I know started using AMZN.  Ended up with 150 shares at an average cost of about $19.  

My parents told me it was a terrible investment because ""It's dangerous to spend money online.""

Then the idiots at Amazon decided they were going to sell more than just textbooks AND start this new ridiculous thing called Prime.  What kind of idiot would pay a recurring fee to buy something online when you could go to the store and get it immediately.

CNBC and all other news outlets said Amazon was worth $1-2 a share at most based on fundamentals, and they would be the final ""dot com"" era company to go under.  I didn't know what ""fundamentals"" meant, but some guy on TV did some math with terms I had never heard and showed Amazon was worth $1.5 a share.  I also remember reading an article that said ""substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future"" because they had to develop and implement the technology and advertise and remember thinking that sounds really bad.

My thinking at the time: Oh man, I have less than $5000 to my name and I have about half of that in Amazon stock.  I mean, if I buy textbooks from them and pay online, and they deliver them with no issues then I don't see why they couldn't deliver everything else the University bookstore sells. I think all my friends would do that as well. But my parents and the financial news are telling me will they will fail, and I don't understand all this P/E, earnings reports, etc....

Neither side is giving up any time soon.

The ONLY reason to sell any of your GME (when it is up) is to have some more house money there ready to ***buy even more GME*** after every time they ladder it down. Use their manufactured volatility against them to build up both cash reserves AND the number of GME you hold.

But as long as you are locked out and can't buy, (like I am, damn it) there is absolutely no reason to sell, especially not at today's price.

821,GME," For anyone who cares, do your own math with the actual numbers

https://news.gamestop.com/financial-information/fundamentals/income-statement

Model out what you think it would look like with their current e-commerce YoY growth figures. What it would look like if they scaled down SG&A. If they successfully pivoted from B&M retailer to e-commerce (not identical, but similar to Netflix pivot 2007 when they were $3)

Next remember that the total number of shares is ~70mil. That means at today’s closing, they had a market cap of 6.28B. GME revenue in 2020 (yes, with pandemic) was $5.16B. 

Figure out what FMV for GameStop shares are post B&M -> e-commerce. Value it like an actual e-commerce company 

That’s why I look at today’s share price and truly think “not a bad deal.” even if there were no short squeeze hype, or even no short sellers.

828,GME," Buy 8 shares so your total is 100. With all the volatility in the GME stock, the premiums for options are high which means you can sell an out the money call (say 150 strike price) and get the premium for it. That is assuming you don't think GME will hit 150 next week because that is what you will be agreeing to sell your 100 shares for. But the point is that you can keep on selling options if they stay out of the money and this way you can earn some extra cash every week, thus lowering the cost basis of your 100 shares. 

It might not seem much, but the more premium you collect the better. Put those shares to work, especially now that it might seem like they'll be heavy bags in your portfolio.

As for the premium you can collect, let's continue with the example of 150 strike price for this Friday (02/05). Robinhood lists the ask price as 9.25, which means you'll be receiving 100x9.25= 925 dollars in premium for selling a call option at 150 dollars strike price that expires this Friday. Remember, these prices change every second during the trading day, so the listed price now will change the moment trading begins tomorrow morning. It's up to you to decide what strike price you're comfortable with. Just go through the option chain tomorrow and pick something you like. But think ahead, what is your strategy? Are you committed to selling your 100 stocks for 150 dollars each should this option suddenly be in the money this Friday? Think it over before you decide upon anything.

They saw fearlessness last week and are trying to break us of that. What they don't get is that we aren't fearless, WE ARE JUST RETARDED AND STOCKS GO BRRRRR!! 

Its courage they see, my fellow autists, and these scared lil bitches don't get it. 

We don't see each other behind our screens and monitors but I see the numbers and they don't lie. We are together, I am here with you all and you with me. The WORLD is with us.  Even my wife's boyfriend Brad is with us and he only eats the yellow crayons (which as we all know is the worst flavor).

We've got some real diamond hands here boys, apes that have literally seen MILLIONS in loss and they are STILL HERE! So grab your fucking balls, quit your bitching, and stock up on these juicy dips cause the HF assholes thought a DISCOUNT SALE was gonna have you running away! This isn't financial advice, this is LIFE ADVICE. Dont be a pussy if someone knocks you down on the playground, dust off and fuck em up!

871,GME," This’ll be buried hardcore, but OP, could you point users to the sub rules and community guidelines. I know there’s been a lot of vitriol on both sides (new users and vets) but half of it is from a shitload of people shitting in the living room. As things chill out, I’m positive the mods will start brining y’all back into the fold. A lot of this is massive growth that was not only unexpected (to some degree we are kinda like the red headed bastard children of Reddit), but it compounds matters when the sub is FLOODED with posts that don’t meet community guidelines.

Q: “But BlueFalcon, you are a worthless piece of shit, and not even a mod, why should we listen to you???”

A: cause I too follow the rules...

Q: “even the gain/loss/yolo rules with a 2.5k limit?”

A: yes, even those, cause before the GME run up, I also was poor and couldn’t post in those categories. I read and stuck to the daily threads for my shitposting.

Q: “what about those bastards, who paper handed like a bitch, like you, can I downvote them to oblivion?”

A: if you want to, but some of us actually have good advice. Some of us have blown up our small PP accounts numerous times trying to catch our break from being poor too. Learn from idiots like me (IE- what not to do) and seek out the smart ones who actually make money.

I am absolutely freaking out. I was planning a well deserved vacation at the end of the pandemic now it looks like Im going to be saving every dollar instead so I can get a piece of what I lose here. where is GME? why havs they not fucking given any news? literally any announcement will help with momentum, and they left all this media shit on them like that.

880,GME," Hey guys retard checking in here. 2020 and 2021 has been a rollercoaster for me. In 2020 I broke up with my 6 years long partner and that is infinitely worst than this. No money can cure the sadness that lasted a few months. I went down the rabbit hole of drinking for a few months and constantly woke up hangover.

Come 2021 my friend introduced me to wallstreetbets and i got so engrossed in stonks I stopped drinking so I can focus on it. It is a hobby now. 

I got 200 GME and seen it went to highs before falling to the lows yesterday. Feeling sad? You should be, it is a lot of money. But remember, it is not a lose or gain till you cash out. 

If a retarded loser like me can recover from binge drinking and diamond hands this shit? you can too. Feel free to PM if any of you are feeling down, there is no point beating yourself up over it. It is just physical materials.

[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wallstreetbets-reddit-bot-activity/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wallstreetbets-reddit-bot-activity/)

They imply that there was bot activity *in favor* of buying GME. I'm not saying that didn't happen, but our problem, especially on the GME specific thread, was certainly not people who like the stock. It was shills for SLV, people spreading FUD, and generally manipulative tactics to be blamed. The official WSB email apparently reached out to CBS. I could see every one of those quotes used being taken out of context and originally directed towards ACTUAL bots.

I know I was up all night on WSB, and the # of bots was outstanding. There was a Thanos snap every few seconds in the comment section when sorting by new. This was always anti-GME stuff from what I saw.

Also, keep in mind that the shills are advancing in their tactics. They started the day saying ""buy silver"". Real WSBers got annoyed and started to downvote those posts. Bots and shills then started saying things like ""Don't buy silver buy GME"". This sounds good UNTIL you realize that everyone was automatically downvoting anything that mentioned silver. This means some people would see a comment suggesting to buy GME instead of silver and that the comment would likely be downvoted by that point. This could lead someone to think ""hmm..people seem to hate the idea of buying GME instead of silver"". Later tactics involved people saying stuff like ""I don't care if we're trending down and I'm going to lose all my $ as long as I'm a part of history"" or something similar. This brand of comments became very popular during close. It was unnatural, all at once, and I looked into many of the accounts to confirm my suspicions. These comments are more difficult to immediately recognize as shill activity, because the nefarious effort is not as obvious. It was *NOT* normal behavior, though.

Even the front page seems to have some possible shills - Example

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb8lwf/why\_the\_fuck\_are\_we\_acting\_like\_we\_lost\_we\_made/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb8lwf/why_the_fuck_are_we_acting_like_we_lost_we_made/)

Nobody said we lost as the post implies. In fact, we are looking really good. Tomorrow we have short restrictions, possible GME announcement, continued good volumes, some $800 call whales, etc. Anyways, you get the idea that shills can be hard to detect.

I recognize that a lot of the behavior I mentioned is legitimate and that the poster I linked to may not be making an underhanded effort.

Anyways, what makes me the most mad is CBS mentioned that the SEC was stepping in on behalf of retail investor's interest in eliminating any illegal activity. CBS did not then mention any of the illegal activity we know to be going on at shitron, but they instead implied that we, in fact, are the target of the SEC.

944,FB," The problem is that most people rely on traditional media to get their information. When it is so easy for the hedge funds to manipulate the message being parroted by this traditional media it becomes a source of disinformation instead. Even worse, that they claim the source is wallstreetbets, when it is really the likes of Citron pulling the strings.

So what can be done?. Firstly, exactly what OP is doing: contact the journalists. Most of the journalists aren't nefarious, just lazy and/or pressed for time. It's easy for them to republish what another news outlet says. All Citron needs to do is to corrupt one of them and the fake news will spread uncontested, unless there is a dissenting view. We all need to be that dissenting view.

Also, contact any journalism regulator or watchdog entity if they exist and complain about misleading/false articles. For example in Norway there is an industry watchdog called PFU (Pressens faglige utvalg . ""The press' professional group"" roughly translated. Anyway many Norwegian redditors have complained to the watchdog about the fake SLV articles released by mainstream norwegian financial media:

[Norske Reddit-brukere klager E24 inn til PFU: - Stoler blindt på amerikanske nettaviser | Kampanje](https://kampanje.com/medier/2021/02/norske-reddit-brukere-klager-e24-inn-til-pfu---stoler-blindt-pa-amerikanske-nettaviser/)

I don't know if there are similar agencies in other countries, but if there are that is an avenue to fight the disinformation.

Another is to bypass traditional media and spread our message across broader social media. I'm talking Twitter, FB, Snap, IG etc. While distasteful to interact with compared to reddit (especially FB), all these other social media platforms has a broader reach than just reddit alone can have.",ultimatox,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbm1ks/i_emailed_a_journalist_to_let_him_know_that_wsb/glv2qln/,0.063,0.903,0.034,-0.7914

There is a problem with this approach.  Emailing/tweeting a journo your view on a situation just means a random anon is complaining because ""boo hoo the internet morons don't like being called this or attributed to that"".  Sounds like shit, but that's the view most journalists will take when contacted by some complete anon because a lot of us get a lot of shit on the day-to-day from people ALL across the spectrum.

The best individual anons can do is contact a journalist and say ""hey, look I know you wrote/reported this, but I don't think it's an accurate take on the community.  Please could you have a look at the top posts over the past few days involving what you've been reporting and you'll see that the **community consensus** is actually the counter.""

The people who need to speak out to journalists most are the community moderators who ARE able to go on public record as the heads of the forum to speak on behalf of the forum's sentiment and general consensus.  From a journalist's point of view, and as a long-time redditor, this is actually a role I expect moderators to step up to when the time is needed. They can talk about the state of a subreddit to a journalist just as they would stick a pinned post at the top of the  forum -  the difference being, the journalist can actually ask a few more questions to help them understand the community etc better.

1025,GME," My uneducated guess and probably based on hope is that the process so far has developed as it follows: 

1. The HF shorted GME predicting an inevitable bankruptcy due to COVID19
2. Some educated retards from WSB of the likes of DeepFuckingValue who’ve been studying and daydreaming of this type of situations saw the opportunity and raised awareness. It also happened that GME is a gaming asset with deep emotional ties for a major part of the whole Reddit community. Add to that the support of some VERY well know and respected figures 📷📷📷 which happened to have a lot of hate for HF shorting his business and a huge snowball formed while the HF were hoping for the hype to wear off
3. The hype never wore off and an emergency plan was executed. Maybe the HF had it in their protocols for years, maybe they just had to improvise. Whatever it was they came up with THIS plan: 0) Delay covering the stocks shorted A) Short the stock again at 400$ B) Ask brokers to cut demand while artificially driving down the price of stocks with ladder attacks. C) Ask brokers to force stop losses on assets D) Buy those assets automatically beeing sent back into the system to cover the stocks shorted at 400$

This leads us to tue current situation where:

1. They still have to cover for the stocks shorted at 4$
2. They recovered some of the billions they will lose covering thise shorts by shorting at 400$ and covering at 100$
3. They cleaned the system of all the paper hands eho puechased during the hype.
4. Now there will be comolete and absolute silence as if everything has passed and everything is lost
5. They keep buying back stock at a rate where the market allows for the price to stay steady, buying from those who tyink it is game over.
6. When the final deadline will arrive, they will stomp to buy what’s left to cover.

1026,VERY," My uneducated guess and probably based on hope is that the process so far has developed as it follows: 

1. The HF shorted GME predicting an inevitable bankruptcy due to COVID19
2. Some educated retards from WSB of the likes of DeepFuckingValue who’ve been studying and daydreaming of this type of situations saw the opportunity and raised awareness. It also happened that GME is a gaming asset with deep emotional ties for a major part of the whole Reddit community. Add to that the support of some VERY well know and respected figures 📷📷📷 which happened to have a lot of hate for HF shorting his business and a huge snowball formed while the HF were hoping for the hype to wear off
3. The hype never wore off and an emergency plan was executed. Maybe the HF had it in their protocols for years, maybe they just had to improvise. Whatever it was they came up with THIS plan: 0) Delay covering the stocks shorted A) Short the stock again at 400$ B) Ask brokers to cut demand while artificially driving down the price of stocks with ladder attacks. C) Ask brokers to force stop losses on assets D) Buy those assets automatically beeing sent back into the system to cover the stocks shorted at 400$

This leads us to tue current situation where:

1. They still have to cover for the stocks shorted at 4$
2. They recovered some of the billions they will lose covering thise shorts by shorting at 400$ and covering at 100$
3. They cleaned the system of all the paper hands eho puechased during the hype.

1100,IRS," Correct.  The system SHOULD be:

1) IRS Sends you a summary postcard of what you owe.  
2a) If you agree, you send back a check.  
2b) If you disagree, THEN you file a whole tax package.

The vast majority of people will fall under 2a.

The IRS had gotten H&R Block, Intuit, and the other scummy Tax services, to offer free return processing in exchange for the IRS not just setting up its own electronic filing system for simple returns (the vast majority of them).  

The tax software companies (predictably) obfuscated the free return web-sites, and upsold lots of people who shouldn't have had to pay.

In 2019 congress narrowly avoided enshrining into law the prevention of the IRS from creating its own Tax Software: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxpayer_First_Act

>But little is known about WestExec’s client list. Because its staffers aren’t lobbyists, they are not required to disclose who they work for. They also aren’t bound by the Biden transition’s restrictions on hiring people who have lobbied in the past year.

>Such high-powered Washington consulting firms are “the unintended consequence” of greater disclosure requirements for registered lobbyists, said Mandy Smithberger, director of the Center for Defense Information at the Project on Government Oversight.

>By not directly advocating for federal dollars on behalf of their clients, they don't have to publicly divulge who is paying them and for what activities, such as the connections they make with government agencies, she said. But it is also impossible to assess the influence they have on federal expenditures.

Why lobby when you can get paid up-front and then plugged directly into the important positions?

Back to your post

And she's got several.

>In the past two years, President-elect Joe Biden’s pick to be Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has raked in more than $7.2 million in speaking fees from Wall Street and large corporations including Citi, Goldman Sachs, Google, City National Bank, UBS, Citadel LLC, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Salesforce and more.

Article also covers:

>Antony Blinken, Biden’s nominee to be secretary of State....The disclosures cracked open WestExec’s closely held client list, which the firm had previously refused to divulge. 

>Biden's pick to be director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, was also a principal and consultant at WestExec.

So a look for ""Biden WestExec"" brings up another article with even more:

>Michèle Flournoy, a top contender for secretary of Defense.

>Meanwhile, Jen Psaki[now White House Press Secretary], a former White House communications director under President Barack Obama who went on to work for WestExec, is now advising Biden’s transition team.

This is a battle between the value of the company. If there are no shorts, then the company would be valued at say $300 per share. Shorts would hop all over that because shorts believe its over valued.

I think high short interest will remain until Ryan Cohen proves the book value of GME.

Shorts were on Tesla and Elon but he burned through them and now Tsla is in SP500, no one would short Tesla now?

What I am concluding is that +100% short is overly high but we should get prepared for short interest to be 70%+ in the future until Cohen turns the company around.",fogcity89,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbdz2e/at_this_point_i_just_want_to_prove_everyone_wrong/gltx1f4/,0.053,0.795,0.153,0.8959

1146,GME," Nah.  It was a good play, even at $380.  Dont feel bad.  The evidence was there and we had no way of knowing what was going to happen.  I dont mind losing to cheaters.

If they hadn't shut down the brokers, GME would have hit $1000+ that day and, with all the meme hype, just kept going.  $5k wasnt unrealistic.  There was a post last week about being 30 minutes from nuking the entire market and I believe it.  These firms would have had to sell off all their other assets to cover their short-term shorts (like ones that were expiring on Friday), which would have triggered a broader market dip.  Even with that, they still might have gone insolvent meaning they wouldnt have had the money to pay us at all.  Trading would have been halted and other forces would have stepped in.

Honestly, I think the market manipulation is going to be a good thing in the long run because these guys simply didnt have the money to buy back they shares they need to cover at $1k.

Heres my prediction: These guys covered most of their near-term shorts with synthetic longs then drove the stock price down to $100.  All the paper hands folded.  The hyped meme momentum is gone. Paper Portnoy is out after donating $700k to shorts.  These synthetics will start being VERY expensive in another 15 days, especially if the stock price stays low.  So now that the market is at a more reasonable volume and there are shares available, shorts will start covering and raising the share price to whatever they opened their synthetic longs at.  They will close these or exercise them.  Either way they will be creating demand for real shares.

I think the VW-like spike got turned into a slow burn.  Were not going to hit $5k now.  My money is on (literally on) something in the $500 range within 3-4 weeks.  Heres why: The fundamentals of the stock have still changed.  There are still a FUCK TON of shorts to cover.  You have to remember, this was at $4 four month ago and $12 one month ago.  Remember that 140% short ratio from a month ago?  All those shorts are down in that $4-$12 range because no one expected this.  No one was shorting a $100 stock back then.

1147,VERY," Nah.  It was a good play, even at $380.  Dont feel bad.  The evidence was there and we had no way of knowing what was going to happen.  I dont mind losing to cheaters.

If they hadn't shut down the brokers, GME would have hit $1000+ that day and, with all the meme hype, just kept going.  $5k wasnt unrealistic.  There was a post last week about being 30 minutes from nuking the entire market and I believe it.  These firms would have had to sell off all their other assets to cover their short-term shorts (like ones that were expiring on Friday), which would have triggered a broader market dip.  Even with that, they still might have gone insolvent meaning they wouldnt have had the money to pay us at all.  Trading would have been halted and other forces would have stepped in.

Honestly, I think the market manipulation is going to be a good thing in the long run because these guys simply didnt have the money to buy back they shares they need to cover at $1k.

Heres my prediction: These guys covered most of their near-term shorts with synthetic longs then drove the stock price down to $100.  All the paper hands folded.  The hyped meme momentum is gone. Paper Portnoy is out after donating $700k to shorts.  These synthetics will start being VERY expensive in another 15 days, especially if the stock price stays low.  So now that the market is at a more reasonable volume and there are shares available, shorts will start covering and raising the share price to whatever they opened their synthetic longs at.  They will close these or exercise them.  Either way they will be creating demand for real shares.

I think the VW-like spike got turned into a slow burn.  Were not going to hit $5k now.  My money is on (literally on) something in the $500 range within 3-4 weeks.  Heres why: The fundamentals of the stock have still changed.  There are still a FUCK TON of shorts to cover.  You have to remember, this was at $4 four month ago and $12 one month ago.  Remember that 140% short ratio from a month ago?  All those shorts are down in that $4-$12 range because no one expected this.  No one was shorting a $100 stock back then.  They were shorting a $12 stock.  100% of that 140% has to be covered with real shares if the price is never going back to $12. Ive heard reputable analysis of a fair market price between $80 and $150.

1148,RH," It’s the ladder attack... the hedgies are selling hundreds of shares back and forth to each other, thousands of times, driving the price down.  

The actual sell volume is low, and buy volume is high.  

Retail is boxed out by platforms like RH.   

Once paper handed normies are out of the way, we can buy in (the dip, now) and then run down the clock until the shorts are called in...

1224,SI," I disagree with your argument #2. Enough shares have exchanged hands since the price blew up to close those positions. Whether the HFs actually have, only a few people really know. But it has certainly been possible.

I've posted this elsewhere, but the shorts we actually know of are the numbers from the 1/15 report. Here are the [reporting dates](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest) if you're not familiar. As for the S3 and Ortex short interest numbers, those are just projections with their own complications that can be gamed. See [here](https://www.shortsight.com/short-interest-of-float-2-0/) for the S3 approach to calculations. Simply put, we don't really know where the short positions are. 

However, we can make educated guesses based on average volume of trading and the size of individual trades going through. To address the first one, Yahoo does show volume at listed at 27.6M, but that appears to be an average over 3 months. Yahoo doesn't explicitly explain how they calculate average volume from what I've found, but various blog posts from the past few years indicate that it's a 3 month period and that seems to line up with what the volume charts are showing on Yahoo (54.76 Million if you average the last three days shown below). According to [Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/GME:NYSE) and [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GME:US), the 30 day average right now is 47.6M. According to MarketBeat's chart info [found here](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/chart/), here is the volume per day since January 15th:

Date | Daily Vol. (Mil.) | # Shares in Case #1 | % Daily Vol. in Case #2
---|--- | ---| ---
1/15 | 46.87 | 3.03 | 12.27%
1/19 | 74.72 | 4.83 | 7.70%
1/20 | 33.47 | 2.16 | 17.18%
1/21 | 57.08 | 3.69 | 10.07%
1/22 | 197.16 | 12.75 | 2.92%
1/25 | 177.87 | 11.50 | 3.23%
1/26 | 178.59 | 11.55 | 3.22%
1/27 | 93.4 | 6.04 | 6.16%
1/28 | 58.81 | 3.80 | 9.78%
1/29 | 50.57 | 3.27 | 11.37%
2/1 | 37.38 | 2.42 | 15.38%
2/2 | 76.34 | 4.87 | 7.53%
**Sum** | 1.08 Billion | 69.0 Million | N/A

This means that a total of 1.07 Billion shares were traded since 1/15. So since 1/15, the average volume has been 90.18M per day (a 12 day period). Since there are 69.7M shares outstanding and ~50M shares that are tradable, and SI float as of 1/15 was calculated to be 138%, Melvin would have needed to cover 69M shares (= 50M * 1.38). 

In Case #1 above (Col. 3), if we take the ratio of daily volume to overall 12 day volume and multiply it by the 69M buyback shares to spread the buyback out over 12 days, we get the third column. So for example, on 1/15, I did (76.34M/1082.26M)*69M = 4.87 Million shares bought back on that day. 

In Case #2 above (Col. 4), if we divide out 69M by 12, and you get 5.75M per day. Take that 5.75M and divide it by daily volume. For example, (5.75M/46.8M) = 12.27% of daily shares would have been buybacks.

Even if you would condense the buyback to occurring from 1/22 to 1/29, the same chart above would look like this:

Date | Daily Vol. (Mil.) | # Shares in Case #1 | % Daily Vol. in Case #2
---|--- | ---| ---
1/22 | 197.16 | 17.99 | 5.83%
1/25 | 177.87 | 16.23 | 6.47%
1/26 | 178.59 | 16.29 | 6.44%
1/27 | 93.4 | 8.52 | 12.31%
1/28 | 58.81 | 5.36 | 19.55%
1/29 | 50.57 | 4.61 | 22.74%
**Sum** | 756.4 Million | 69.0 Million | N/A

It's not that difficult to slip those percentages in when you are a hedge fund. They have the computing capacity to execute a lot of trades very quickly and with almost nanosecond precision. These algorithms can also be made to be very difficult to detect. Look at volume on Thursday (1/28) at a micro level when Robinhood and others stopped buys almost across the board. Robinhood stopped trading right around 10:30am IIRC, and volume spiked from 240K per minute at 10:33am to 996K per minute at 11:24am. Most retail investors could only sell at this time and obviously the hedge funds were one of the few major parties buying up these shares. If Melvin bought shares during that dip at an average of say 500K per minute, they could have met the number of shares shown above in case #1 in the condensed approach (i.e., the lower chart) in just 10 minutes. And while volume died off during the day, each dip was responded to by an increase in volume, which gave the hedge funds a chance to buyback and cover.

I'm not saying this as someone who has sold his shares (I'm at 14.38 shares at an average cost of 136.50 per share). I am still holding all of my shares because I think we could still see a bounce for other reasons, but we need to be as objective as possible here and I haven't seen a good argument refute what I found above.

1231,SI," I think you are missing two other points. 

1. DFV locked in massive gains. Nothing wrong with this, but when everyone keeps saying ""If he's in, then I'm in"" are missing the fact that he locked in $13,000,000 in profit. Just look at his daily posts, but ya know, actually fucking read them.
2. Everyone keeps parroting the idea that these hedge funds have to pay these enormous interest payments and eventually they will cave due to this high cost. Ok. Fair. But who are they paying the interest payments to? If that entire thesis about there being way more shares shorted and effectively counterfeited, then a number of big name players could be involved in that practice. Therefore, they would do everything in their power to not squeeze their co-conspirators because it could bring them all down. This is how cartels work. It is in all of their interests to keep the status quo as to allow them to manipulate their markets to the fullest. Even if that status quo is allowing each other to survive. The system is based upon interdependence. And doesn't Citadel have two different arms? Couldn't they just be lending the shares to themselves? Not to mention all of this is predicated on them still being short at very low prices. The worst of the positions were likely shorted at $20. If they shorted new shares at say, $250, and hadn't had to buy any of their $20 targets back yet, they could have covered their positions from 250 to 70, earning 180 profit for each, then covered their old shorts losing 50 per share. That makes them potentially 130 in the green.

We might be holding a bunch of shares that were shorted in the 130+ range.

1243,GME," I can help tackle the Float Conundrum. 

Even if you don't read this, please upvote discussion-relevant threads to keep them toward the top of the comments. 

It's late and I'm tired, so I'll try to be brief.

The shares outstanding are 69.75 million.   
For those of you just joining us, that's all the shares that exist right now. 

Whenever a company, institution, or person **buys or sells** **more than 5%** of the shares (3.48 million) they have to file a **schedule 13g within 10 days**.  
Whenever a company, institution, or person **buys or sells** more than 10% of the shares (6.97 million) they have to file a **form 4 within 10 days**. 

*Unfortunately this doesn't apply to opening or closing a negative position.*   
They don't have to report their short position on a schedule 13g or a form 4. 

The **Form 10-k** is the annual earnings report. The **Form 10-q** is the quarterly earnings report.   
Both of these forms are *legally required to disclose the float*.

Unfortunately, since the big squeeze was 5 days ago, on 1/27/21, we'll have to wait at least five days to know which institutions sold into the push - and which, if any are still holding.

The **most encouraging hard data** I see is this **schedule 13g** filed by Blackrock *the day after the squeeze.* [Herein](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18461/html) BlackRock discloses a position of 13.2% (9.21 million shares) in GME. 

But we know that they had to file no more than 10 days after taking the position, so they could have been in as early as 1/17/21 (buying the dip) and they could have sold already.

Our best hope of an accurate float count is an **earnings report.** Also keep an eye out for an ensuing flood of **Form 4's and Schedule 13g's,** which should arrive **prior to 02/10/21.**

These won't give us an absolute number, they'll give clues about where the big money got in - and possibly out.

The GME **10-k** 

* Seems to usually come out at the end of March
* Their fiscal year seems to end on Feb 2nd
* Could be helpful 
* [Here's their 202](https://last10k.com/sec-filings/gme#:~:text=(GME)%20SEC%20Filing%2010%2D,ending%20Saturday%2C%20February%201%2C%202020)[0](https://last10k.com/sec-filings/gme#:~:text=(GME)%20SEC%20Filing%2010%2D,ending%20Saturday%2C%20February%201%2C%202020)

The GME **10-q**

* Fiscal quarter ends in March
* Long ass wait
* By then the info will probably be out of date

I would say the best bet would be to wait for the 10-k, then follow the trail of form 4's and schedule 13's.

1244,GME," Frankly, this past week this sub has been full of so much misinformation and literal idiots trying to push off desperate opinions as facts with no substance.

I've personally been swinging shares and options due to volatility this week on both long and short side to come out with hefty profits.

The amount of stupidity and blindness in this sub recently is going to create a massive group of bagholders and people who missed out on a rare chance to realize a lot of money.

OP - great post.

FWIW I think there may be a chance of a squeeze which is why I hold some shares, but I also understand there is a good chance shorts covered + any rallies right now are further covering. I also fully do believe that brokers+funds pulled shady and likely illegal maneuvers Thursday onwards, which effectively killed this completely.

Fuck the suits - this was never a level playing field from the start, and retail is always at a disadvantage.

If you're playing GME, hold core positions but swing the volatility for profits.

Greater fool theory is in play and it's your money.

That means if SI was reduced by 30m and there were 10m new shorts, then total covering had to have been 40m shares. There is no way that 40m covering shorts out of 55m volume, almost a 3:1 ratio, would result in the price movement seen Friday. Maybe they had ITM options that expired? Idk.

What I think is more likely is that they hedged the positions with otm options expiring in the future. This synthetically closes the position but doesn’t really close it.

1257,GME," I'm not buying that bullshit about short-ladder attacks. I think even without hedges fighting back, it's not hard to imagine the stock sliding down on low volume.

Once GME blew up, literally the entire world news was talking about it. That might be the fastest and most comprehensive advertisement campaign the world has ever seen. Basically everyone falls into two camps: People who heard about the GME shit and decided to buy in, and people who heard about the GME shit and decided not to buy in. Anyone else was living under a rock and wouldn't affect the market anyway.

There was a huge surge of buying interest while everyone learned about this, and tons of people who got in late had to buy on margin. So much so that Robinhood ran out of money and couldn't lend out enough cash to make the trades happen, so they had to shut down trading on it. They weren't the only ones either, since Apex clearing house (and any broker they clear for) also shut down trading the same day. Once those people purchasing the stock at ridiculous prices got in on margin, there was basically nobody left to buy. The whole world heard about it, and anyone intent on buying already spent all their money and was holding.

Because of volatility, brokers had to increase margin requirements to protect their own interest (which they are allowed to do by the contract you agree to when opening an account). Since nobody was buying, the stock fell down a bit. Suddenly all these people on margin don't have enough value in their account and get margin called. How does a broker sell these shares? Individually for each account? Maybe they instead ship them over to the clearing house in bundles of 100 to simplify fees? What price do they sell them at? Probably whatever price guarantees that it goes through right now to settle the margin call, so $0.01 below market value. This wasn't a ""short-ladder attack,"" it was just a cascade of margin calls on retards who bought a meme with money they didn't have. But why wasn't there much other volume if all of this was going on? Probably because all the other retards who got in thought they were part of some crusade that meant they needed to hold at all costs, that's why there isn't any volume.",SugaryPlumbs,43,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbaktb/sober_review_time_what_are_the_actual_data_we_can/gltnga2/,0.045,0.883,0.072,0.8576

1264,ALL," probably the last time ill argue this since this thread has traction. Short ladder attacks are not real. Check the good discussion in [This Thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/latax6/short_ladders_are_not_real/). Dont downvote it because you disagree with it, absorb it and form your own opinion. Asks questions. Some of us who have been doing this shit for a long long time are still willing to help.

Lets take your evidence 1 by 1.

 > At this point its guesswork based on limited evidence provided by redditors. Essentially, round share numbers sold within microseconds at fractional prices

This happens ALL DAY LONG for almost all tickers and especially done for high volatility tickers. it doesn't matter if its on an [Upswing](https://imgur.com/6WLu5gh) or a [Downswing](https://imgur.com/Hljw71l). This is Algos trading and scalping pennies on the dollar. If you want, I will show you any other symbol that has this exact same result throughout the day. 100 shares is also the default for any trading terminal. Orders through RH or online are generally left blank, but as soon as I open a trade through my terminal, default is 100 shares.

 > Evidence needed: I've seen but can't find better video evidence showing the stream of rapid trades at fractional prices and round share counts (100 shares at a time), could use that. :

This was based on nasdaq.com data. Like I just provided as evidence above this is on a trading halt on a [Downward Stock Move](https://imgur.com/7NgmHPL). nasdaq.com takes aggregate data and not true real time. Look at the right of my image, that is the real time trades. You have to pay money to see this information. This is what any stock ticker looks like when you have a massive amount of shares sold. 


 > Evidence needed: That the price dips over the last 48 hours haven't been accompanied by massive trading volume. I'm seeing a lot, especially compared to Thursday's artificial suppression:

We had 2 notable halts today (I know there were more but these are easy). 1 of which was the price dropping, 1 was on the rise. Make your own call and judgement on this here. [This is the volume data with the price data](https://imgur.com/yKkMxYY). Tell me why, the drop is a short ladder, but the rise is just normal? To expand on this. The volume of a trade for the market to drop heavily DOES NOT MATTER. All that matters is if the amount of shares being sold is greater than bid depth chart. Thats it.

1265,RH," probably the last time ill argue this since this thread has traction. Short ladder attacks are not real. Check the good discussion in [This Thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/latax6/short_ladders_are_not_real/). Dont downvote it because you disagree with it, absorb it and form your own opinion. Asks questions. Some of us who have been doing this shit for a long long time are still willing to help.

Lets take your evidence 1 by 1.

 > At this point its guesswork based on limited evidence provided by redditors. Essentially, round share numbers sold within microseconds at fractional prices

This happens ALL DAY LONG for almost all tickers and especially done for high volatility tickers. it doesn't matter if its on an [Upswing](https://imgur.com/6WLu5gh) or a [Downswing](https://imgur.com/Hljw71l). This is Algos trading and scalping pennies on the dollar. If you want, I will show you any other symbol that has this exact same result throughout the day. 100 shares is also the default for any trading terminal. Orders through RH or online are generally left blank, but as soon as I open a trade through my terminal, default is 100 shares.

 > Evidence needed: I've seen but can't find better video evidence showing the stream of rapid trades at fractional prices and round share counts (100 shares at a time), could use that. :

This was based on nasdaq.com data. Like I just provided as evidence above this is on a trading halt on a [Downward Stock Move](https://imgur.com/7NgmHPL). nasdaq.com takes aggregate data and not true real time. Look at the right of my image, that is the real time trades. You have to pay money to see this information. This is what any stock ticker looks like when you have a massive amount of shares sold. 


 > Evidence needed: That the price dips over the last 48 hours haven't been accompanied by massive trading volume. I'm seeing a lot, especially compared to Thursday's artificial suppression:

We had 2 notable halts today (I know there were more but these are easy). 1 of which was the price dropping, 1 was on the rise. Make your own call and judgement on this here. [This is the volume data with the price data](https://imgur.com/yKkMxYY). Tell me why, the drop is a short ladder, but the rise is just normal? To expand on this. The volume of a trade for the market to drop heavily DOES NOT MATTER. All that matters is if the amount of shares being sold is greater than bid depth chart. Thats it. It could take as little as a few thousand shares to break it, it could take millions.

1273,GME," Hey  [u/smohyee](https://www.reddit.com/user/smohyee/) 

For argument #6: VW Squeeze

A couple of differences to point out. Back then it was one institution vs the whole Wall st, where as today it is retail against Wall st. Institutions don't like it when other institutions don't pay up but they would collude together to help rip off the retail investors. Also, it is way easier for one institution that owns 74% of all VW float to diamond hand (plus they publicly announced it to create a frenzy) than trying to coordinate 8M degenerates to hold on GME (half probably paper hand anyway). 

Because Porsche was trying to secretly take over VW alone, they were slowly buying up their shares, pushing up the price from 200 Eur to 400 Eur as a one-man show. No other fund agreed that VW was worth that much, especially with dwindling sales during a crisis/liquidity crunch in the market at that time, so they all decided to short it and it dipped by 50%. Jokes on the funds, Porsche came back out saying they were the majority owner of all the floats available, which left the funds who shorted it scrambling to cover their position, resulting in a short squeeze.

Lastly, VW was trading at 400 Eur before it spiked 2.5x to 1005 Eur. When GME went from $60 to $158, back down to $85 the next day then finally peaked at $468, that is almost 8x from the initial squeeze, way more than the 2.5x VW squeeze. And now they got RobbingHood and all the other brokerages manipulating it at full force, which was not a factor back in 2008.

1274,EV," I think the stock is worth $60 minimum and here's why:

It's all about the future, and GameStop's ability to pivot to ecommerce and away from brick and mortar with the help of our boy RC. Fundamentals matter very little when looking at certain stocks (like a lot of the companies in the EV space), and I think GameStop is one of them. It is irrelevant what multiples the name trades at currently, its all about the likelihood of the scenario playing out where a company dominates the market down the road. For GameStop its all about how likely they will be able to pivot to being a dominant player in the gaming ecommerce industry.

Just a few months ago, GME was viewed as a failing retail store that ripped people off (remember the memes? how much will GameStop offer me for this 1 day old console and games? $20!). GameStop's brand had little to no value, HOWEVER after this whole fiasco, the GameStop is worshiped by an entire generation of retail traders. GameStop could start selling hotdogs next week, and I have no doubt people would line up to buy them. This is huge because this generation of retail traders is generally younger, probably mostly male aka the EXACT target market that must be captured to successfully transition to niche gaming ecommerce. This essentially guarantees GameStop gets a chance at bat, and exponentially increases the odds of the scenario that GameStop will become a dominant player in gaming ecommerce. 

I know I said fundamentals don't matter, but lets quickly talk valuation. At $60 a share that would put GME's mkt cap at roughly $4bn. How much will this company be worth if they pull it off? 

Currently Chewy has a market cap of $42bn, but the gaming sector is already larger and growing much faster than the pet supplies industry. Assuming similar margins for both companies that are now dominant players in their respective sectors. I used assumptions for current market size and CAGR assumptions of what was the average of the top few studies on google, and found that in the year 2030 the gaming sector will be more than 4 times the size of the pet supplies industry. I wouldn't even know how to discount anything back to 2021 and highly doubt its possible to do it remotely accurately, but that alone is enough for me to know that this could be something big if GameStop can pull it off. I am talking easily $100bn mkt cap stock minimum without any squeeze.

1286,GME," Here's my theory, not financial advice.

When the short positions expired last Friday, the shorts were removed from ""short interest volume"". Pair that with the massive sell off we saw in major stocks (likely hedge funds selling to cover their position) may explain why such a large portion of short interest disappeared. 

The remainder of the short positions will now need be be fulfilled within T+3 days marking tomorrow. Also if you look at the SEC rules on failure-to-deliver, those need to be delivered within T+4 days which is Thursday. (*Rule 204 – Close-out Requirement -* [*https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm*](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm)*)*

I think we'll know whether the shorts covered their position or not by Thursday/Friday.

I think the biggest risk is that retail investors have probably been selling off their GME on Monday and Tuesday only further helping shorts cover their position at lower costs.

The question is, is the demand higher than the supply going into Wednesday and Thursday?

1287,SI," For Argument #1 - read the S3 breakdown of how they calculate.  At 57%, they are saying (%Float + synthetic longs) are near the top and that margin rates will skyrocket when locates come in.  

Excerpt from S3 article:

First, we are nearing the top end of SI % of Float as it is very rare to have more than 60% of Float + Synthetic Longs in a stock’s lending pool. Second, at a 57.22% S3 SI % Float coupled with a logically correlated 33% stock borrow fee we can make the assumption that there is not much stock borrow supply left in the stock and if the S3 SI % of Float increases, rates will increase at an exponential rate on the relatively small amount of new stock borrows that are still available to take down. And third, the chances of a short squeeze in the name is very high. If long lenders or long margined\rehypothecated shareholders sell their stock, there is very little stock borrow to replace the shares being removed from the lending pool.",meted,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbaktb/sober_review_time_what_are_the_actual_data_we_can/glu2g8i/,0.014,0.928,0.057,0.6597

1289,GME," I don’t think the float is counted correctly. Being as GME is in more than one index, (SP600, Russell2000) lots of ETF index funds track or include shares of GME.

I don’t think those shares are trading, unless GME gets delisted from SP600 or Russell2000.

IF the hedge funds truly get clobbered back to the Stone Age, and the squeeze gets squoze, 500,750,1000,2000,4000..... at some point before 69420 a share, there will be darkroom deals to delist GME from either SP600 or Russell2000 index just so those funds dump shares, take profit and release pressure.

That said, even if the float is 10-15 million shares smaller than expected, is that enough? If price remains at $100 per share for 3 weeks, what’s that cost the people with short positions in interest?

-peak media attention / euphoria / global interest peaked last week and has died off

-volume has given shorts plenty of room to cover 

-ccac guy sold, Michael burry criticized price action, rod sold a bunch, so did Hubbard, Viking not really involved, dfv can do whatever the fck he wants at any time

-Volkswagen was a completely different situation

Why we will squeeze 
-artificially suppressed buying comes roaring back 

-still one of the most shorted floats on Wall Street by most accounts

-zero shares available for borrow on IBKR, Fidelity

-zero notable insider selling (RC etc)

-no offering from the company (they know stuff and hate shorts)

-second squeeze, if there is one, likely won’t be halted by RH liquidity issues unless they want to destroy their biz forever 

-possibility for new strategic investments (blue sky like Microsoft, Sony, Tesla?, I don’t know) or friendly billionaires like Cuban to come in

-retail has exhibited extremely strong hands and most are unlikely to sell between zero and $500 given what we went through last week ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",LittleDruck,365,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbaktb/sober_review_time_what_are_the_actual_data_we_can/glt4upf/,0.06,0.807,0.133,0.9482

1328,EDIT," Yes, that needs to be pointed out. To add on, OP has a lot of great points, but we should also look at the counterpoints.

1. S3 released numbers claiming the short percentage as 122. Hours later they changed that number to 55%. As explained in other posts, this is likely the same raw data with different calculations.
2. The claim is that hedgies could have covered because total volume was higher than the number of shares they need to cover. But unless I’m misunderstanding, total volume is not the same as unique number of shares. If 10,000 shares exchange hands 100 times, that’s 1M of volume. Yet it could be the same 10,000 shares. In reality, we have know way of knowing the unique number of shares sold in a period of time, therefore we cannot say whether the shorts could have covered or not.
3. I think the biggest smoking gun here is the media. We’ve seen obvious concerted efforts at manipulation, and particularly to get retail to sell. Why? I think as long as the media is pushing to sell, we know someone has a vested interest in shares being sold. And that someone is most likely the shorts.
4. Brokerage restrictions, and other maybe-illegal activity. Same as with #3, why go through the trouble. Yes, the potential SEC fines and lawsuits will probably be a slap on the wrist, but I’d imagine they’d only take these actions if they stand to gain more than they lose.

EDIT: Since so many people seem to be leaving comments that disappear. I’m not saying any of this is proof. I’m simply pointing out alternatives. Yes it’s entirely possible the shorts have hedged. It’s also possible that they have not.

EDIT 2: A lot of people seem to be misunderstanding my point about unique shares. Yes it’s possible for shorts to say buy 100 shares, fulfill some of shorts, and then buy those shares again. It’s also possible that nobody is selling and they’re playing with the same shares. My point isn’t that it was impossible for them to cover, merely that total volume does not prove that it was even possible for them to cover. We simply do not have the data to say one way or another.",aoechamp,1031,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbaktb/sober_review_time_what_are_the_actual_data_we_can/gltgesu/,0.058,0.786,0.156,0.9884
1329,GME," Also what about shorting of GME not being allowed legally as of tomorrow, is that legitimate information? If it is, why would that need to be the case if shorts have fully covered? Additionally, why is it that each day there are never shares available to short? If shorts have been covering, one should assume more shares would be made available to short, or am I misunderstanding?

Somewhat related, who benefits, and what are the benefits of the twitter ads (promoted posts) claiming melvin has closed out? Are we to assume someone paid for these ads out of kindness to help retail investors?

1349,RH," These are the same shares traded back and forth.  But it doesn't have to be short sellers.  In fact, it's the whole fucking point of market makers.  They are ""making"" the market.  They are what guarantee that most of the time the bid/ask spread on stocks are at historical lows.  And, yes, they may end up talking to each other, but that volume generally relates to liquidity which is useful to all market participants.

The stock is not dropping b/c of ""short ladder"" attacks.  If there were buyers, they would buy up the other side, and the attack would be useless.  If there were buyers, the stock couldn't be driven down without matching short volume.

The blame for this situation lies squarely with DTC who protected the short sellers, period.  They didn't even need to be evil, they just had to be self-interested.  The short side was going to blow up, so they tipped the scales in the short's favor.  As a monopolistic entity, they had RH by the balls, and negotiated their required deposit down by $1B, along with an *agreement to limit the net volume of $GME buys* over some period of time, likely until the end of this week.

Why do I suspect this last part?  Because of the way RH is controlling $GME volume by tuning their limitations ""5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 20, 100"" with the latter increase coming as $GME decreased drastically in price (so that it corresponds to roughly the same amount of dollars).  Tues/Wed of last week saw epic buy-side $GME volume on RH, but after a substantial cash raise, RH should be in a position not to be dicked around anymore.  And yet the limitations are still present.

DTC's calculations didn't make sense from the start, as RH's supposed deposit requirements jumped by 10x.  DTC claims they needed to ensure that RH deposits covered the net (buy volume - sell volume) over the T+2 settlement period with 99% probability.  Supposedly this required a 10x increase in RH's deposit.  That's not due only to volume, that's due to an increased volatility estimate (i.e., the estimated variance of the net buy volume was much larger).  In other words, the 99% safety margins needed to be much beefier.

But this is an insane way to measure the net buy volume volatility, as RH simply can't keep buying without their users depositing massive equity.  Most of that buying is going to come from selling other securities, meaning that the net buy volume in a given day was likely to decrease.  There is a negative feedback effect because two days after Tues/Wed, the deposits are cleared, and all that equity is then sitting in $GME, unable to be used to keep moving the daily net buy volume.

DTC knows this.  But even this simple mathematical argument is too complex for a jury or a congressional hearing to follow, so they can refer to them as ""risk management measures"" and avoid admitting that they actively manipulated the market in their own self interest.",gradientsdescended,452,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbaktb/sober_review_time_what_are_the_actual_data_we_can/glt8538/,0.088,0.831,0.081,-0.8442

1352,RC," I believe the things above almost perfectly cancel each other out. 

For example, if the stock was frozen in time at $350 and then RH turned trading back on (I can’t believe a broker turning off trading is normal now....gah) ... I would say we rip higher 

But it’s gonna take a lot for a shook RH trader to come back and buy this massive dip versus chase the momentum that we’re not seeing right now.

1375,RC," You do know that the price climbed by an order of magnitude of \~25x in the past 30 days right?

A market cap shift of $48,000,000,000 at one point between December's low and January's high.

Last month, more than 1,200,000,000 shares of $GME changed hands. Yes, you read that right,  the \~50m float changed hands 25 times last month. You're telling me in all of that, the shorts wouldn't have been able to cover?

Melvin (who likely had the lowest cost average) claims to have been flat by mid morning Wednesday the 27th.

$GME opened on the 26th at $88.26 and was trading at \~$352 when Melvin Capital announced they were flat. The bulk of that price movement, while certainly fueled by retail, was exacerbated by Melvin (and several other shorts) covering (also reflected in other equity sell offs at the same time on the 26th and 27th). That price movement reflects $13.2b.

This entire situation over the last few weeks was exacerbated by other funds wanting in on the action both on the long side for the squeeze and the short side to try to bite off the squeeze near the top. Funds were lining up around the block for an opportunity to shore $GME anywhere north of $100 (and rightfully so).

The only way this thing can squeeze more (it's likely still very highly shorted based on S3 and other current data) is if retail momentum somehow sky's the price another 3x and scares out some of the smaller short positions that are in around the 200s. It will literally take 10s of billions of retail (or other) money to facilitate a follow up squeeze here.

And for the last f'ing time (not for you but for anyone reading this), the borrow rate and interest paid by shorts doesn't mean shit. Melvin Capital has had a short position in $GME since 2015. They operate on a very, very different timeline from WSB and retail and most of these funds will happily hold their shorts (even if underwater) for years or until RC convinces them that $GME will never die.

Diamond Hands to the Paper Handed and WSB FAKES - We are the APE Army!

Paper Handers, we live in a world that has walls, and those walls have to be guarded by men with diamond hands. Who's gonna do it? You? You, Private Paper Hands? I have a greater responsibility than you can *possibly* fathom. You weep for financial losses, and you curse the Diamond handed. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know -- that the temporary decline in GME, while tragic, probably saved lives; and my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives. I am a true Diamond Handed Ape and completely unqualified to offer financial advice. I just like the stock.

You don't want the truth because deep down in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me on that stock-- you *need* me on that stock.

We use words like ""Ape,"" ""tard,"" ""autist."" We use these words as the backbone of a life spent defending something. You use them as a punch line.

Diamonds have neither the time nor the inclination to explain ourselves to infiltrators who rise and sleep under the blanket of the very freedom that we provide and then question the manner in which we provide it.

I would rather that you just said ""thank you"" and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you hold and stand the post simply because you like the stock. Either way, I don't give a DAMN what you think you're entitled to!

Market opens soon ... let's get to it!

They didn’t understand that allowing the crash meant more everyday folk could buy the stock... This is not about money anymore or profit... They should all read the art of war...

GME symbolises us the retards they never gave opportunities to flourish and took away from us and poor ppl as a whole so they played it wrong... As usual they only saw dollar signs...

Well I say they can fuck each other with their collusion and manipulation because no matter what we will not be stopped.

My uneducated guess and probably based on hope is that the process so far has developed as it follows: 

1. The HF shorted GME predicting an inevitable bankruptcy due to COVID19
2. Some educated retards from WSB of the likes of DeepFuckingValue who’ve been studying and daydreaming of this type of situations saw the opportunity and raised awareness. It also happened that GME is a gaming asset with deep emotional ties for a major part of the whole Reddit community. Add to that the support of some VERY well know and respected figures 📷📷📷 which happened to have a lot of hate for HF shorting his business and a huge snowball formed while the HF were hoping for the hype to wear off
3. The hype never wore off and an emergency plan was executed. Maybe the HF had it in their protocols for years, maybe they just had to improvise. Whatever it was they came up with THIS plan: 0) Delay covering the stocks shorted A) Short the stock again at 400$ B) Ask brokers to cut demand while artificially driving down the price of stocks with ladder attacks. C) Ask brokers to force stop losses on assets D) Buy those assets automatically beeing sent back into the system to cover the stocks shorted at 400$

This leads us to tue current situation where:

1. They still have to cover for the stocks shorted at 4$
2. They recovered some of the billions they will lose covering thise shorts by shorting at 400$ and covering at 100$
3. They cleaned the system of all the paper hands eho puechased during the hype.
4. Now there will be comolete and absolute silence as if everything has passed and everything is lost
5. They keep buying back stock at a rate where the market allows for the price to stay steady, buying from those who tyink it is game over.
6. When the final deadline will arrive, they will stomp to buy what’s left to cover.

2. They recovered some of the billions they will lose covering thise shorts by shorting at 400$ and covering at 100$
3. They cleaned the system of all the paper hands eho puechased during the hype.
4. Now there will be comolete and absolute silence as if everything has passed and everything is lost
5. They keep buying back stock at a rate where the market allows for the price to stay steady, buying from those who tyink it is game over.
6. When the final deadline will arrive, they will stomp to buy what’s left to cover.

The best plan they could come up with to avoid total bancrupcy for Wall Street.

1436,GME," For all the naysayers calling us idiots for not selling and the the fundamentals etc does not justify GME to be in the $1k or even 20-30 range. 
Forget the fundamentals, forget the market sentiments, forget the technical chart voodoo readings. Forget about the short ratio, shares outstanding, float, etc. 

The question is if we are all fools for holding why is this not a $5 stock?

What was it the Mark Cuban said? Oh supply and demand. That’s right. It’s that simple. We APEs are strong together and for whatever reason have limited the supply of stock of GME to the point that the stock price has not reverted to its normal or intrinsic value. This may be a $5 stock but forces are at work preventing it from being a $5 stock. 

Hold if you can.

1441,GME," **Short selling** is a fairly simple concept—an investor borrows a stock from a pension fund like BlackRock **(pays interest on it like a loan may be plus the rise in value of the stock)** or it's a naked sale, **sells** the stock on the market to a buyer (T+3 settlement), and then buys the stock back some time in the future, at the market price, to return it  to  the lender. **Short** sellers are betting that the stock they sell will drop in price. If the price rises and stays up and the terms of their agreement with the lender expires short sellers can lose a lot if they have big positions.

It looks like it's best for you to hold on if GME is 150% by hedge fund managers, as there's not enough stock to cover these positions in addition to the fact most retail investors own much or all of it. They  are still hurting dude.

1491,GME," My uneducated guess and probably based on hope is that the process so far has developed as it follows: 

1. The HF shorted GME predicting an inevitable bankruptcy due to COVID19
2. Some educated retards from WSB of the likes of DeepFuckingValue who’ve been studying and daydreaming of this type of situations saw the opportunity and raised awareness. It also happened that GME is a gaming asset with deep emotional ties for a major part of the whole Reddit community. Add to that the support of some VERY well know and respected figures 📷📷📷 which happened to have a lot of hate for HF shorting his business and a huge snowball formed while the HF were hoping for the hype to wear off
3. The hype never wore off and an emergency plan was executed. Maybe the HF had it in their protocols for years, maybe they just had to improvise. Whatever it was they came up with THIS plan: 0) Delay covering the stocks shorted A) Short the stock again at 400$ B) Ask brokers to cut demand while artificially driving down the price of stocks with ladder attacks. C) Ask brokers to force stop losses on assets D) Buy those assets automatically beeing sent back into the system to cover the stocks shorted at 400$

This leads us to tue current situation where:

1. They still have to cover for the stocks shorted at 4$
2. They recovered some of the billions they will lose covering thise shorts by shorting at 400$ and covering at 100$
3. They cleaned the system of all the paper hands eho puechased during the hype.
4. Now there will be comolete and absolute silence as if everything has passed and everything is lost
5. They keep buying back stock at a rate where the market allows for the price to stay steady, buying from those who tyink it is game over.
6. When the final deadline will arrive, they will stomp to buy what’s left to cover.

Launch GameStop beyond the Moon! Hopefully this can help our moral up! Here's my opinion about what opportunity there is here.

I think GME will fly beyond the moon, I hope this will help our resolve. Please Spread this out if you think I maybe on something. ;)

If you read thanks again la! >.<

I would like to imagine this was a multi-year project event would put GameStop on top of the world.

Think about it. Gamestop looks to have reduced their float by 40million pushing the short interest to over 100%. They are the catalyst as to why this short squeeze is happening. They had 100 million share outstanding originally years ago, they aggressively focused on reducing debt and buying back equity these past years which reduced their profits during those same year which only got the shorters to double down and write articles about the potential bankruptcy of GME. Little did the shorters know.

They hired the retired Nintendo chairman Reggie and Chief executive Officer George Sherman formally CEO fo Verizon. 

Micheal Burry and DFV: Owned (MB)\~1.75 millions shares (DFV)\~100k shares on market. Bring attention to the short interest float to Gamestop

Ryan Cohen: eCommerce Founder of chewy epet store that can compete with likes of Amazon. Taken up 10% of marketable shares away from the Float and bring in expertise on creating an eCommerce business.

Gamestop: Has been reducing expenses (stores and management) and debt over the years and if you've notice when you go to GameStop they no longer just sell video games they have expand their product lines, to memorabilia, board games, electronics, hobby items, and expanding to computer parts.

This quarter: GameStop has had a considerable growth of 800% in their e-commerce sales stoking peoples attentions. Plus It is also a new game console generation supercycle so this coming quarter can expect decent revenues.

The squeeze Opportunity, let GameStop the ability to take new capital from issuing shares, literally taking the hedge funds money to fund this new global eCommerce project. In the meanwhile they bring a huge population wealth and stability, thus forming an occult of people who can truly be converted into diehard fans of the company brand.

The squeeze brought in many institution on the long side, such as blackrock and vanguard they actually will have a vested interest in the growth of GameStop. Notice that ETFs top the investments they generally don't sell out their positions entirely

From zero to hero bring wealth aside from themselves to everyone who believed in it and generating capital injection for this project from the hedging who shorted them for so many years, same capital to work on a new console platform industry equal to value steam. An new industry platform under their guide linked with their new expanded product line.

If you can imagine connecting these dots I feel there's something big coming for GameSpot. I would love to imagine if they launch a brand new online playstore platform at peak of this Squeeze. It would instantly stabilize the price and build huge expectations.

Starting fresh with a brand heavily believed in by it's followers, freshly capitalized by it's shorters, a global sensations with an opportunity to present to the world it's freshly minted ecommerces.

Imagine you had the opportunity to invest in the PC Steam platform product of Value when it just started.

Just my opinion

Let hold the line brothers and sisters. I'm fighting alongside you!

At $90 the company market cap it only 6.9 billion. It does over 7 billion annually and is quickly trying to convert to digital with Ryan Cohan and now he's adding two more members to the company from his previous company Chewy. Ryan is trying to convert the company to a ecommerce powerhouse. Like Chewy they trade at multiples.

TLDR: This squeeze gives GameStop the opportunity to compete with the like of Value Steam and amazon

Launch GameStop beyond the Moon! Hopefully this can help our moral up! Here's my opinion about what opportunity there is here.

I think GME will fly beyond the moon, I hope this will help our resolve. Please Spread this out if you think I maybe on something. ;)

If you read thanks again la! >.<

I would like to imagine this was a multi-year project event would put GameStop on top of the world.

Think about it. Gamestop looks to have reduced their float by 40million pushing the short interest to over 100%. They are the catalyst as to why this short squeeze is happening. They had 100 million share outstanding originally years ago, they aggressively focused on reducing debt and buying back equity these past years which reduced their profits during those same year which only got the shorters to double down and write articles about the potential bankruptcy of GME. Little did the shorters know.

They hired the retired Nintendo chairman Reggie and Chief executive Officer George Sherman formally CEO fo Verizon. 

Micheal Burry and DFV: Owned (MB)\~1.75 millions shares (DFV)\~100k shares on market. Bring attention to the short interest float to Gamestop

Ryan Cohen: eCommerce Founder of chewy epet store that can compete with likes of Amazon. Taken up 10% of marketable shares away from the Float and bring in expertise on creating an eCommerce business.

Gamestop: Has been reducing expenses (stores and management) and debt over the years and if you've notice when you go to GameStop they no longer just sell video games they have expand their product lines, to memorabilia, board games, electronics, hobby items, and expanding to computer parts.

This quarter: GameStop has had a considerable growth of 800% in their e-commerce sales stoking peoples attentions. Plus It is also a new game console generation supercycle so this coming quarter can expect decent revenues.

The squeeze Opportunity, let GameStop the ability to take new capital from issuing shares, literally taking the hedge funds money to fund this new global eCommerce project. In the meanwhile they bring a huge population wealth and stability, thus forming an occult of people who can truly be converted into diehard fans of the company brand.

The squeeze brought in many institution on the long side, such as blackrock and vanguard they actually will have a vested interest in the growth of GameStop. Notice that ETFs top the investments they generally don't sell out their positions entirely

C) Ask brokers to force stop losses on assets D) Buy those assets automatically beeing sent back into the system to cover the stocks shorted at 400$

This leads us to tue current situation where:

1. They still have to cover for the stocks shorted at 4$
2. They recovered some of the billions they will lose covering thise shorts by shorting at 400$ and covering at 100$
3. They cleaned the system of all the paper hands eho puechased during the hype.
4. Now there will be comolete and absolute silence as if everything has passed and everything is lost
5. They keep buying back stock at a rate where the market allows for the price to stay steady, buying from those who tyink it is game over.
6. When the final deadline will arrive, they will stomp to buy what’s left to cover.

1592,GME," You could sell and feel fucking shitty and rrgrdt your decision for losing 75%. That's what so many noobs and weak emotional people would do/did. That's okay. Cut your losses if you can't take the stress.

Literally down 65% rn. Holding because I got in for the fact to stick it to wall street and the manipulation. Also for everyone who had their arses fucked in 08'. Now I want to avenge them. 

Of course I didn't yolo everything in because I only put slightly more what I was willing to lose. People who yolo'd everything is to make quick money off of the hype train is exactly the kind of people which wsb don't need. 

Even if GME goes down to 4%, I'm okay knowing the company suffered partly because  of me, fellow apes and the collective of average people who don't dick down others to make a quick buck. I am extremely proud of being part of this movement, even saw some people pledge some of their earnings to donations and things like that and not much before have brought people so close and united together. This is the shit you live for and makes live worth it. Fuck the money. You will work your whole life making money, little or not. That's not life's purpose.  I will not flail because this bet is going my way. People, money and profits should not be your only priority in this, understand the bigger picture. If we get rich, cool. But that's it. Let's fucking stick it to the cunts in finance.

Using their high valuation, GameStop takes out excellent lines of credit, accelerating what would be a several-year rebranding to finish in summer 2021, culminating in the release of GME prebuilt PCs, which absolutely dominate the hobbyist market.

What I didn't factor in was just how powerful the financial industry is, in that the media can spread lies about how Reddit is done with GME and they're onto silver, hedge funds can ladder attack all day every day with zero consequences, and brokerages can just flat-out stop allowing people to buy and even sell their customers' shares against their will ""for their own good"".

A lot of the people new to this sub really don't get it, but people here have legitimately made and lost millions of dollars in an instant. People have actually killed themselves due to the losses sustained here.

We joke and stuff about how we're degenerate gamblers and retards and stuff but it's also extremely serious. People have YOLO'd mortgages, credit card cash advances, lines of credit, college funds, and more.

If anyone new to this sub reads this, take this place seriously. It's extremely fun to be here, but if you aren't careful you can and will find yourself in debt, homeless, or dead. This diamond hands stuff is a great meme but man, taking profit is a skill that many people fail to learn.

**What is taking profits?**

Taking profits is ***not*** being completely retarded and going full on diamond hand monkey man. It's something I think you learn over time but basically you need to sell off your position in small (or large) increments at levels you are comfortable with. The smart people here cashed out a bunch at $150, then some more at $300, then some more at $400 (maybe) and some more at $300 and some more at $250 and so on.

This can be difficult because, I know as well as anyone, it's hard to walk away from the tables when you're on a hot seat. It means setting a goal and sticking to it, as difficult as that can be. It means trying to detach yourself psychologically from the dollar figure you're seeing. You can't get emotional and be like ""Oh man, it's gonna hit my limit sell, I better pull it so I can try to time the peak better.""

If you told yourself selling at $200 was fine with you, stick to it. If you think it might run higher, maybe don't sell everything, but take some money out. It doesn't have to be everything. Take enough out to cover your initial investment. Take enough out to treat yourself.

I got into GME calls when it was around $35. I told myself I'd cash out around $1k because I've been burned before. I cashed out when I was up exactly $1000. How do you think I felt when it went over $100 on Monday and was at $300 by what, Thursday, and my calls were worth $30k?

Bad? FUCK NO. I made a thousand fucking dollars! That's four days of work. That's awesome. It's not a million dollars, but I was able to treat my wife to a nice steak, and bought my kid a toy, and reinvested the rest into other dumbass YOLO plays.

He basically says to hold if you believe (in the company) and that if we want the stock to go up, GameStop need business, so go and give them business. He speaks of the squeeze in past tense and goes back to fundamentals. He literally says the shorts had plenty of time to cover already, short ladders are a made-up thing, and the media was lazy not propaganda (not researching well the whole silver thing).

And these sharks arrived to take their cut of the spoils...hedge fund Mudrick Capital booked a profit of around $200 million on positions in both GameStop and AMC Entertainment ([AMC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC?p=AMC&.tsrc=fin-srch)).  Mudrick, which has about $3 billion under management, returned just  under 10% in January according to Bloomberg, marking one of its best  months since inception.

I'm not willing to bet everything I have in a game where your opponent makes the rules. What we all did was incredible, arguably the biggest shock to wall street the common man has done in decades, but as soon as hedge funds and MMs put their cards face up and stopped hiding their market manipulation by openly preventing retail from buying I knew this was over.

Still, everyone has to blow up their first account, it's a right of passage on here. I know I sure did back when I was just starting out. Everyone has to learn that you have to go in with a plan, understand the risk, not fall to FOMO, and know that you're a goldfish swimming with the sharks who can eat you whenever the hell they want.

I feel especially bad for the people who leveraged credit cards/student loans/rent money on this, but rule #1 in life is not playing a game where you can't survive every outcome. You and me can't risk money we can't afford to lose, only the elites and hedgies can do that.

First rule of WSB is always assume everyone here is a moron. Including me. And you. Doesn't matter how long and well-formatted someone's DD post is, or how many fancy graphs it has. They're probably a moron who knows nothing. Know this, accept it, and embrace it.

The REASONABLE thing to do is to put that money in an index fund and forget about it for 30 years. But this sub is about gambling, not being reasonable. Some of us gamble for fun and try (and almost always fail) to be smart about it. Others are here to YOLO their way out of wage slavery- which is also totally valid IMO. But make no mistake- this place is a casino. It is not a guaranteed path to success.

> But even though it's money I wouldn't care if I lost, 

That is the only money you should use to make plays on this sub. Unless you want karma; we fucking love it when someone YOLOs their mortgage or student loans. It's what makes this place great.

>I keep looking if I should just pull out, cut my losses and chalk it up to a short term capital loss for this year and move on with the money that's still left. I mean it isnt much but I could put the money towards a different (more reasonable) stock that I value highly and see a good future in for the next few years.

Someone gave a great piece of advice the other day re: GME: If the amount of money you have on the line is causing you to not have fun, get out.

Experienced traders will tell you every play they make has defined exit points for both profit and loss. Money sitting in a stock has an opportunity cost. If you're tired of a losing play and think you'll have better luck with something else then move on. There is always another play out there. If you learned something from the loss then consider it tuition paid. If the stock moons after you get out then you can also learn from that. Maybe you missed something. Maybe getting out was the right move given the information available but you just got unlucky.

Again, the reasonable move is to put that money in SPY, ideally in a retirement account, and forget about it. The mostly-reasonable thing to do is buy and hold a high-quality stock you like. If you aren't having a good time at Uncle Jerome's Hotel and Casino, then it's probably time to do one of those.

First rule of WSB is always assume everyone here is a moron. Including me. And you. Doesn't matter how long and well-formatted someone's DD post is, or how many fancy graphs it has. They're probably a moron who knows nothing. Know this, accept it, and embrace it.

The REASONABLE thing to do is to put that money in an index fund and forget about it for 30 years. But this sub is about gambling, not being reasonable. Some of us gamble for fun and try (and almost always fail) to be smart about it. Others are here to YOLO their way out of wage slavery- which is also totally valid IMO. But make no mistake- this place is a casino. It is not a guaranteed path to success.

> But even though it's money I wouldn't care if I lost, 

That is the only money you should use to make plays on this sub. Unless you want karma; we fucking love it when someone YOLOs their mortgage or student loans. It's what makes this place great.

>I keep looking if I should just pull out, cut my losses and chalk it up to a short term capital loss for this year and move on with the money that's still left. I mean it isnt much but I could put the money towards a different (more reasonable) stock that I value highly and see a good future in for the next few years.

Someone gave a great piece of advice the other day re: GME: If the amount of money you have on the line is causing you to not have fun, get out.

Experienced traders will tell you every play they make has defined exit points for both profit and loss. Money sitting in a stock has an opportunity cost. If you're tired of a losing play and think you'll have better luck with something else then move on. There is always another play out there. If you learned something from the loss then consider it tuition paid. If the stock moons after you get out then you can also learn from that. Maybe you missed something. Maybe getting out was the right move given the information available but you just got unlucky.

Again, the reasonable move is to put that money in SPY, ideally in a retirement account, and forget about it. The mostly-reasonable thing to do is buy and hold a high-quality stock you like. If you aren't having a good time at Uncle Jerome's Hotel and Casino, then it's probably time to do one of those. You could also consider selling all but 1 of your shares, just in case something fucking wild happens.",UsingYourWifi,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbj15v/please_control_your_risk_please_protect_your/glvlgbg/,0.071,0.777,0.152,0.9929

Retail can hold all they want, they'll just end up holding bags. Because the institutions aren't apes. In fact, they are NOT allowed to be apes even if they wanted to.

- Risk tolerance restrictions. Same reason why Cathie Woods can't hold 100% Tesla stonks in her ARKK fund.

- If the shares did sky-rocket to $1k a share, SEC would literally force arbitration on these institutional holders to settle at a reasonable price with the shorts. This would cause long side institutions to lose more money than if they just sold it willingly at like $200-400.

1. The HF shorted GME predicting an inevitable bankruptcy due to COVID19
2. Some educated retards from WSB of the likes of DeepFuckingValue who’ve been studying and daydreaming of this type of situations saw the opportunity and raised awareness. It also happened that GME is a gaming asset with deep emotional ties for a major part of the whole Reddit community. Add to that the support of some VERY well know and respected figures 📷📷📷 which happened to have a lot of hate for HF shorting his business and a huge snowball formed while the HF were hoping for the hype to wear off
3. The hype never wore off and an emergency plan was executed. Maybe the HF had it in their protocols for years, maybe they just had to improvise. Whatever it was they came up with THIS plan: 0) Delay covering the stocks shorted A) Short the stock again at 400$ B) Ask brokers to cut demand while artificially driving down the price of stocks with ladder attacks. C) Ask brokers to force stop losses on assets D) Buy those assets automatically beeing sent back into the system to cover the stocks shorted at 400$

This leads us to tue current situation where:

1. They still have to cover for the stocks shorted at 4$
2. They recovered some of the billions they will lose covering thise shorts by shorting at 400$ and covering at 100$
3. They cleaned the system of all the paper hands eho puechased during the hype.
4. Now there will be comolete and absolute silence as if everything has passed and everything is lost
5. They keep buying back stock at a rate where the market allows for the price to stay steady, buying from those who tyink it is game over.
6. When the final deadline will arrive, they will stomp to buy what’s left to cover.

The best plan they could come up with to avoid total bancrupcy for Wall Street.

Add to that the support of some VERY well know and respected figures 📷📷📷 which happened to have a lot of hate for HF shorting his business and a huge snowball formed while the HF were hoping for the hype to wear off
3. The hype never wore off and an emergency plan was executed. Maybe the HF had it in their protocols for years, maybe they just had to improvise. Whatever it was they came up with THIS plan: 0) Delay covering the stocks shorted A) Short the stock again at 400$ B) Ask brokers to cut demand while artificially driving down the price of stocks with ladder attacks. C) Ask brokers to force stop losses on assets D) Buy those assets automatically beeing sent back into the system to cover the stocks shorted at 400$

This leads us to tue current situation where:

1. They still have to cover for the stocks shorted at 4$
2. They recovered some of the billions they will lose covering thise shorts by shorting at 400$ and covering at 100$
3. They cleaned the system of all the paper hands eho puechased during the hype.
4. Now there will be comolete and absolute silence as if everything has passed and everything is lost
5. They keep buying back stock at a rate where the market allows for the price to stay steady, buying from those who tyink it is game over.
6. When the final deadline will arrive, they will stomp to buy what’s left to cover.

The best plan they could come up with to avoid total bancrupcy for Wall Street.

But unfortunately this sub is filled with people who lost a lot of money on GME and are desperate to cling to anything that gives them hope that their losses will come back.

1855,BC," If you know the risks that's fine, the concerning part is all the fresh meat here doesn't seem to. 

See what I think about this situation is like it's been pitched as an effectively free money trade, can't lose etc but for some reason only retail investors are allowed to do it except they're also kinda not BC robinhood blocked trades. If it was guaranteed free money you'd think maybe the uninvolved professionals would get in on this.

Remember markets are zero sum so that money has to come from somewhere. The idea that Melvin would be squeezed and their money would be perfectly transferred to retail investors is naive in my opinion. Even if it DID squeeze to 1000 then the people who didn't sell in that instant would be bagholders. So step your limit sell to 999 then. But what if it only squeezes to 800? Set your limit to 799 then. See the trend? You have to sell before everyone else does. You're trying to catch the illiquidity in the market driving the price up and to claim said profit you have to add liquidity. You need to hit exactly the tipping point when the shorts are covering and need to beat everyone else to selling. Which, I might add, the funds on wall st with insider information and financial tools and education are much much better equipped to do.

By virtue of this situation a bunch of retail HAD to lose and people didn't understand this risk. If you bought above 'fair value' which I have no idea but I'd assume is around 20 to 40, maybe much higher now it's a meme, then you have to realise you're trying to perfectly time the peak even if the squeeze is still yet to happen.

And I also think a lot of posts were sinisterly promoting diamond hands so they could cut their profits and run. Stonks is a ruthless game.

Second edit: I keep seeing comments by people who don't meet the karma requirement saying stuff about my 'fresh meat' comment and saying that you knew the risk. It was provocative language for sure but if you knew the risk then I dont mean you. I'm talking about all the people who massively overleveraged because they thought it was free money and I'm not going to say these people are common but if you look around they're not hard to find.

The market and the people behind it: wall street, alot of retail traders, even a lot of posters here don't give a fuck if you put your life savings into this and are now down 80%, they'll take it in a heartbeat even if for them it's an insignificant amount of profit, at the expense of ruining your life.

1898,GME," I just really don't believe that the hedge fund shorts at the bottom who ran the short interest up in 2019-2020 to 140% when they were shorting around $5 suddenly escaped when the price was already in the hundreds.  Think about it, they had the entire way up to $500 when they had to illegally shut down buying the stock to cover.  Why the fuck weren't they covering during January when the stock was moving up from $17 -> $34 - $45 -> $60 -> $150, etc. ??

Something fuckin wreaks and I can't tell if it's the millions of bots who've flooded these threads to call everyone bagholders or the fact that there's still so much negative publicity being put out on Gamestop but the last few days have just felt strange to me.  

If someone can just address my first paragraph I'd appreciate it, I know people are saying the hedgies covered through dark pools and that it's over and that GME is now a dead stock but I'm just really doubting that the original hedge funds covered in the past couple weeks because it wouldn't of made sense to in the hundreds when they could have when Gamestop hit $20 in the fourth quarter of last year.

Went from £5k, to £450k at the peak, to  £25k now. 
I'm going through a rollercoaster of emotion. Happiness, inspired, regret, anger, despair. **And I'm UP 20K**  

I think the unrealised profits that were in my grasp is just hard to dismiss at this moment. I just really hope I'm forming a diamond here under this pressure. 

I said to myself at the time that I had to hold, the squeeze is not squoze, and I would have 100% regretted more missing an opportunity to make a million than to lose what I already had.

I think that's still true, and I've been largely okay with my choice, but I have a niggling sensation in my brain still wondering if I made the right call. Melvin is in my fucking brain.

Just wanted to get this off my chest retards, I'm still here, I'm still in it, just needed to vent

This is fine argument about only risking what you can afford to lose, and it is true that he is safer holding because he's loaded no matter what. But it isn't an argument against holding at all.

1932,DD," ‘Twas the week before short squeeze, when all through the house,

My wife she was blowing, other men with her mouth;

She swallowed her boyfriend, then kissed me goodbye,

To the basement I crawled, Tendies in my eye;

I sat at my desk, began to jerk it real slow.

What’s up with GameStop! How high can it go?

I stared at the screen and refreshed it real fast,

The ticker stopped moving, has Robinhood crashed?

When out of the darkness, a rocket emoji was seen,

The graph started moving, high into the green;

I clenched my own rocket, felt FOMO indeed,

This stock is just rising, how to proceed!

I search on the net, and found a great forum,

Its members liked memes, and lacked all decorum;

I checked the top post, and read it with glee;

DeepFuckingValue says: “DIAMOND HAND GME”

I read on some more, to learn I was gay,

“Follow the Autists, they know their way”;

I read even more, read shit all day,

I came in my gourd, this was the way;

Most of the posts, they rallied with calls,

But only for people, equipped with huge balls;

Now, Autist! Now, Retard! now Degenerates and Mods!

On, Comrade! On, Soldier! On, Vikings and Gods!

Buy Options! Buy Stocks! Hold them for weeks!

The shorts are still bleeding! Look at the Greeks!

I spoke not a word as I glanced at my savings,

These people had knowledge, in their rantings and ravings;

I looked at my account, and bought me a share.

Fuck those hedge funds, FUCK YOU Gay Bears!

I joined in the choir and shouts of the masses,

who buy their FDs, pull DD from asses;

“Fuck Melvin!, Fuck Shitron!, Fuck Hedge Funds and Fools!

New Lambos!, New Yachts!, new Houses with pools!”

I feel good with my choice, I am part of their war,

This fight is with Wall Street, let’s settle the score;

The markets ours now, what lies us ahead,

It’s hard to think lately, with gains in my head;

I wanted to post this, to have my voice heard,

You fucked us with GameStop? A forum of Nerd?

So on to Valhalla, GameStop will moon,

DIAMOND HAND BITCHES, DON’T SELL OUT TO SOON.

My portfolio gleamed, I bought a whole stock,

“Mods are still gay, they can suck on my cock.”

My cost basis for NIO was around $37. It got up to the $50s and seemed to be rising higher. Then one day (after a catalyst: the potential delisting by the government) it tanked. It got to around $38 and my paper-handed bitch ass sold all my shares.

Then what happened?

It fucking rocketed not two minutes later. I felt like such a punk. Since then I've vowed to do two things:

A) If I buy stock in a company, I do it based on the DD. Based on the research some other retard on here did but then doing some myself to confirm it.

B) If I believe in the DD, then it doesn't matter what the price action is; I fucking hold.

1962,GME," Someone just posted this but it instantly got deleted so I’m reposting it. 

Off the bat with my GME bros we have seen massive losses. I have seen a lot of people panic and that is not good. So a little recap, we saw prices drop from 115 to 78 very quickly. I think that a lot of short sellers doubled down and shorted even harder than before.  In effect, their mission was to drop the price of gme as fast as possible. NYSE then announced that they could no longer short shares of GME for 30 days. Now, that tells me a whole hell of a lot of shares were shorted and we will not know until the 15th with exact numbers. That needs to be a take away, the hedge bros risked it all to kill the price, and it worked, but the method of shorting even harder to kill the price is no longer on the table. NYSE said nope. So now the short percentage could be huge, we do not know. We have all the leverage, we own the shares in cash. So if you are currently panic selling, may I ask why you are not calm? The hedge bros sent their worst, all they can do now is PUT OPTIONS. Let me repeat PUT OPTIONS. They shorted so hard today they are no longer allowed to short. We own the shares, why are we panic selling? The battle should be over by now. I am currently at a loss, but I am calm and I believe if everyone take a step back at what happened today they will realize that we are not losing. In fact we made them double down on shorts. Ya know the same thing that hurt them the first time. So drop a comment, let me know why you feel the need to contribute to the hedge bros needs. The line is only as strong as you are.

1971,GME," I had to make the play with the rest of you.

I'm getting old. I played by the rules all my life, and did my homework. I work 9-5, go to the gym, put some cash in to my insurance premiums, social security, and housing fund. I invested in some good index funds and have ready emergency savings. I still don't have enough to start a business even though I kept my nose clean. I live in a banana republic of a shithole of a country and the game is rigged here like the rest of the world.

When the GME news broke out early January, I scrounged up all the spare cash and savings I was willing to lose and applied for foreign banks and brokers. I punched the wall as the price went up while I was being verified when I could've bought in otherwise. When I got in, my average was high (but I averaged down earlier), and continue to hold with you beautiful bastards.

The thesis and maths on the GME play were sound. I just didn't count on Robinhood and other brokers cutting off natural demand and stifling momentum—while big hedge funds could continue trading and laddering/covering. But I was already in last Thursday. I have no personality to file suit so for those in the class action, bleed them dry for me and please find a tougher broker.

If I lose it all, it'll be fine. I'm covered and will continue with my third world shitty status quo of a life. But GME will probably be my one shot to get out of this shithole existence. Maybe if this all plays out well I can finally tell mom to stop working, I can finally put my sisters into good schools, and I can finally afford decent stuff. 

I don't want to die like every other lame bloke.

I'm holding with the rest of you until the stars.

2031,GME," Bottom line: naked short selling creates ‘phantom shares’. This can be hidden for a lot of complex reasons. Clever apes understand, and no need for autist apes to do the same: just follow the clever apes.

‘Phantom shares’ drive real shares out of the market - into hiding. Like Gresham’s Law for currencies: bad money drives good money out of circulation. Zimbabweans know this.

Eventually, however, the bad stuff becomes worthless and then the real stuff becomes precious.

You hold your GME till the bad stuff is exposed and worthless. No matter how much you are tempted to exchange your precious GME for shit.

The longer you hold your GME, the more ‘real’ it becomes because of T+2 settlement rule and other rules. The more the system MUST identify you as the actual owner of real shares, not phantoms.

This is a game of time, not price.

Edit: many thanks for the kind awards. It took me a long time to sift out the wheat from the chaff. I forgot to post position: about 1300 shares of GME in 2 separate brokerages. Dunno the average price and don‘t care. I fretted about the red till I realised it does not matter.

Edit: edit. Sent this Tweet to Janet Yellen just now. @ JanetYellen.  Please do your job tomorrow. The SEC must enforce the laws and rules on naked short selling of stocks, and ‘failure to deliver’. It is unacceptable to shut retail traders out of the market but simultaneously allow other participants unrestricted access.

Apes: quick reminder about a SERIOUSLY IMPORTANT PSA for anyone holding shares in Robinhood

Really hate to be posting this multiple times, but I think it could be a MASSIVE help against the dirty tricks of the shorters. Please feel 100% free to copy-and-paste this, it’s important but I don’t have enough karma to create an entire post.

I’ve 100% confirmed with Robinhood support that setting a limit sell does NOT prevent them from loaning out our shares. That’s a myth. The only way to prevent lending is to “downgrade” to a Cash Account, which must be done by emailing them. Without that, your shares are still lendable even if you aren’t using any margin. Link to support email confirming this: [https://m.imgur.com/tiuN3o1](https://m.imgur.com/tiuN3o1)

Imagine if even 50% of WSB switched to a cash account. We’d rip back millions of shares from the lending pool. I highly, highly recommend doing this ASAP. Email Robinhood today and get the downgrade immediately.

There are some minor tradeoffs: cash from sales and deposits will settle/become available for re-use more slowly and you won’t have “instant deposits” anymore. It will NOT impede your ability to sell whenever you decide to, though.

Please spread the word, and if you have enough karma please feel free to make a post. NOT financial advice, just my opinion!

2247,EV," Yeah, that is true, but Tesla did have a massive run up this past year overall despite its high stock price. It wouldn't be hard to believe that Tesla's successful run-up lead people to think they've ""missed the boat"" with Tesla. Tesla's performance during 2020 and it being an EV automaker made Nio seem attractive at it's low price range which was accessible to people to invest in and people thought that because Tesla ran up massively, Nio will too and it did, thanks to Tesla. 

If Tesla didn't have that massive run up and made people reconsider EVs to actually be the future of automotives, Nio wouldn't have been as successful and would've likely been bankrupt had the CCP not have bailed them out. So Nio does ride Tesla's coattails as mentioned before",pabloescagains,31,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb70ix/what_explains_this_symmetry/glt8yh1/,0.066,0.786,0.147,0.9135

In some random stranger's DD a couple weeks ago it was speculated that a fair market value for GME is around $160 considering the board reshuffle and potential move towards online trading. This might just be a good long term trade.

2392,DD," It’s like Cuban said, this stock went down due to the demand shock. He said there’s no doubt in his mind that the stock has been shorted again. His personal opinion? Hold until brokers lift trade restrictions and hit again!
He said what would make the biggest difference is if a whale or two joined WSB (e.g., Chamath and friends). Chamath even offered WSB to reach out to him with a strategy, claiming he’d provide funds. I’ve been on wsb for a while now. I love how pumped everyone is, but at some point if we want to be more organized and actually utilize wsb in a way that could be sustainable, we need to chill with the whole “I’m holding till their in prison”...”hedgies can suck my...”, anytime DD is posted “sorry, can’t read I’m ape, where banana” or “I eat crayons”. These things were all funny when this sub was under 1 million people and you’d see it pop up every once in a while. But at this point, it’s cringe. It’s like when your little brother told you a joke and you made the mistake of laughing and he wouldn’t stop. 
I haven’t seen any good DD on her in a minute. Where do you think this entire movement came from? DD, I know, shocking. We all know about the manipulation that’s been happening, but guess what? The SEC doesn’t give two shits and never will. Reach out to politicians. This is the only way. I’m sick of every post being about shit that’s been posted 50385863 times already “hedges using ladder attacks, PROOF”. Cool, no one gives a shit. 
What I’m saying is, let’s take full advantage of this community we have. We have this extremely powerful entity and could do so much with it. Stay focused and buy and hold. But also look for other prospects. Teach yourself as much as you can about balance sheets, income statements, cash flow, ROE, ROA, all that shit.

tldr: If you want to see it moon, stop buying and selling options on this stock. It happened with tesla, and it's happening now. 

You saw the volume on the stock today vs options. If everyone on reddit is telling the truth, then we ARE the long volume. Redditors took profit, redditors bought more on the dip but there weren't the sort of huge volume you would see for this amount of volatility.

There is not some magical cabal controlling this stock, there are individual investors, some of them institutions but still individuals making choices about when to take profit and what strategy to take.

And every one of these individuals is a vulture who is trying to extract maximum profit from their positions. Even you. Some of you fought the ladder attack, some of you joined it.

This ebb and flow is what prevents this sort of event from being an everyday thing. There is ALWAYS someone on the other side trying to counter your strategy. Jumping on the bandwagon or hedging against you. 

You don't need to imagine some sort of cabal manipulating the price down. If they could do that by themselves the price would never have gone about $20. It's not just the hedges now, you are competing against some guy named Bob who made 1 mil on the run up then sold off and yoloed it into puts. And 500 guys just like him with a variety of positions.

The real villains here are the algos that have been using the IV to skim huge amounts of money by closing the options gaps as soon as they open up. Ask yourself who is taking those $35 dollar premiums on an 80 dollar price difference, can you trade fast enough to exploit that with low risk? Fuck no... but someone is.

For all we know, we are fighting with ourselves now and the hedges are just trading on that artificial IV, with tools we can never have.

That's my sentiment. They needed it dead and gone initially. But the amount of attention this got scared them. They were already sweating bullets with just 2 million WSB autists. But having all of Reddit, the internet, common retailers, large investors, celebrities, etc. put so much momentum behind this that the short squeeze would've been astronomical. They effectively killed momentum for regular people, who want to move on to the next story or they saw that we liked SLV for some reason. Even though we all collectively went, ""WTF said that? That isn't us."" It could've been done to distract us but in my eyes, it was done to distract common retail investors who saw this, saw the price of SLV go while GME is down. It would seem to fit the narrative, until today where it tanked. Then they say, ""WSB is still on GME."" Man, what a nice narrative to present to regular people. It sure does do a good job to discredit us, don't it? I mean, how many articles written talk about us in a positive light? Most of them have absolutely no idea what they're talking about, they have a conflict of interest, or simply don't like what we're doing. I get the third part, but the first and second reasons are inexcusable. You are reporters, we're retards and do more research on a subject than you. 

However, they haven't killed WSB and the internet. If anything, we're getting more and more stubborn. And they don't like that. 

**Remember, the HF took on massive losses just like we have. You don't think they want that money back?** Look at all the people getting offended by our actions. Motherfucker, some asshat was crying on Television over us playing their game, acting like regular people would sympathize with him. They don't like that fact that we actually outsmarted them. 

We can't pretend like they haven't done nothing. They acted accordingly and a lot of people fell for it. They paper-handed it, and you know what, that's fine. SO many people were cheering us on and were encouraging us to fight the powers that be, until they got into a little dip. Then slowly but surely, they moved on. The true diamond hands, held like goddamn champs. We didn't budge.

But, we know that it plans to do and that honestly, a mix of nostalgia and internet sentiment will keep it around for a while. **But, more importantly, that the company was and still is undervalued.** I feel as if this DD does a better explanation than I do.

What I feel, in my gut and my heart, is Melvin and others still want this company to be in the dumps and die a slow death. They still want to short, otherwise they would be frantically taking long positions and trying to balance their losses in different entities (which they partially may have done with SLV but that's another can of worms). 

Basically, they have a short position. A big one. They may have doubled down. IDK. But they haven't left. There are a lot of shorts still available. Most people still think this company will die. That mentality doesn't change, especially when you're losing. If they did truly leave, that means that they would cover their losses by buying up shares and they wouldn't care about the 53% losses they took so far this year to a bunch of apes on a subreddit and move on. LIKE THAT'S EVER GONNA HAPPEN.  

So, in my view, a short squeeze happens in some form. Retail interest is still riding strong, at least on WSB and the Internet.  Just not the one we wanted. We will still get our tendies and ride to Valhalla.

What I feel, in my gut and my heart, is Melvin and others still want this company to be in the dumps and die a slow death. They still want to short, otherwise they would be frantically taking long positions and trying to balance their losses in different entities (which they partially may have done with SLV but that's another can of worms). 

Basically, they have a short position. A big one. They may have doubled down. IDK. But they haven't left. There are a lot of shorts still available. Most people still think this company will die. That mentality doesn't change, especially when you're losing. If they did truly leave, that means that they would cover their losses by buying up shares and they wouldn't care about the 53% losses they took so far this year to a bunch of apes on a subreddit and move on. LIKE THAT'S EVER GONNA HAPPEN.  

So, in my view, a short squeeze happens in some form. Retail interest is still riding strong, at least on WSB and the Internet.  Just not the one we wanted. We will still get our tendies and ride to Valhalla.

That's my sentiment. They needed it dead and gone initially. But the amount of attention this got scared them. They were already sweating bullets with just 2 million WSB autists.

I get the third part, but the first and second reasons are inexcusable. You are reporters, we're retards and do more research on a subject than you.

2456,GME," If you had capital gains you can offset all of those with capital losses. The $3k/yr (not $2k/yr)  is capital loss deduction that you can use to offset taxes on earned income (e.g. salary). If you still have capital loss from a year that was not used to offset capital gains/earned income tax, you can carry those to following years to offset capital gains and up to $3k of earned income in following years, until you have no more capital loss left to use as offset.

Let's say you lost $50k on GME this year. You had $20k of gains in other investments. You also had earned income (salary etc.). For this year, you don't pay capital gains tax on $20k gains and income tax on $3k of your salary. You now have $27k to carry over to following years to be used in the same manner ($3k on earned income and unlimited on capital gains) until it goes to $0. By having a loss, you're basically saving on tax on other gains/income.

2518,GME," Sanity left the room when millions of total newbie retards entered the room like complete fanatics and created an echo chamber, which sadly ends up devaluing the GME play.

I’m still in (125@38) because I genuinely think it’s a decent long term play, covered my costs and took a little profit at the top, with a decent chance of an upcoming more “natural” squeeze. Few people understand that with the attention on the stock, it just couldn’t unravel like we wanted it to. WAY too damaging financially for the hedges. 

Now that paper hands have been shaken off, I believe it gives them a little more room to accept manageable losses and could mean a closing of short positions at acceptable loss levels for the hedges without spiking to insane levels like 10k a share, which technically could have happened last week.

If that happens, great! If not, I bought into GME for the value, the new console cycle, and the revival story. I didn’t even think the shorts would hold their positions that long initially and thought GME would sell shares in January.

Google does a lot of tracking, which many people don't want, so they use alternatives to their services.

Fellow Space-Cadets! 🌌 Hear me out, I mean this with the utmost sincerity: Let this bard uplift your spirits to the skies. Motivation is important af right now, you know it and i know. Music is/was used in pretty much every war to rally the masses and soldiers.
So i took the time and made [this youtube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW9Y2m4gc6G3d2a1m3A7XUZlDxdlNdX0F) to be our drums of war that we march to. (Constantly working on it, very open to suggestions, added lots of recommendations from you guys, at this point it's not my list anymore it's OUR LIST) There is something for everyone since my taste in music is as divers as a fucking lgbtq-gathering in Seattle. 


Pay attention to the lyrics, listen to songs you'd otherwise never listen to and watch the music videos. (Easter eggs all around if you have a smooth diamond brain)


I DON'T WANT NO AWARDS, INTERNET POINTS OR WHATEVER, FUCK ALL THAT.
I WANT TO GIVE HOPEIUM TO THE HOPIUMLESS AND SPREAD GOOD MUSIC. 


Stay strong my fellow tards, monkees, degenerates, brothers in arms. I have been overwhelmed by the feeling of community and idealism so i'm doing my part with 4 shares at 276€, 4 shares at 90€ and this list of music. 

Loving each and everyone of you ugly fucks.

Between the continued patronizing media and trading restrictions this stock continued to remain elevated. Then starts the low volume ladder attacks and the price still stays elevated above realistic valuations.

Translation: The original autists are pissed and locked in. The new autists bought their 1 share tickets.

2624,DM," I would also like to point out, I do have a small position now. I was in early (43) added later on and I did take profits. I closed my remaining position on the way down.

Robinhood opened trading again and it was a very good entry for a the fundamental long hold. This was my plan, take profit on the spike re enter for long haul.

I’m telling you this because I feel that for the newer folks here there should be some guidance and transparency on what some of us are doing.

I believe in the fundamentals, the long term outlook, if there’s a second squeeze I will run the same play, sell the pop, rebuy on the drop, hold.

2689,GME," I agree, we need more people putting actual bets on the line when they’re making these statements/claims.

I just re-watched the OG piss drinking video that someone recorded last year. It was truly unbelievable, had me laughing the whole time. And the comments underneath too, so good.  That’s what this sub is all about! 

Watching that video definitely helped with the GME stress.  I thought to myself “Yea, it sucks GameStop didn’t continue to go up all the way to $1k, but at least I’m not drinking my own piss in a dungeon basement.” I wish someone had made another promise to drink their pee if it didn’t hit $1k...

2691,GME," Absolutely. When I got into GME, I had $3000 to my name and I was six months into living in my parent’s basement after getting laid off from my service industry job on the other side of the country in March.

And I said “I can YOLO $3k because I can make $3k in a reasonable amount of time if I lose it all”

I set myself rules: Don’t spend more than $500 on any specific options purchase, diversify into multiple stocks, and only buy things that I genuinely think are undervalued or will hit a higher value on a future date.

I got exceptionally lucky, and I realize that. But the amount of people that have DMd me or commented on my gains post to ask me “what the next stock is” “how did you do it” and “how can I make insane amounts of money in a short period of time” miss them point entirely. 

Because sometimes you get fucking lucky, and if you play the game right, you stand to make WAY more than you stand to lose. And that’s just how the cookie crumbles.

But when you buy into a stock that you already know is overvalued when it’s at a price like $300ps and you don’t think it belongs there, and you put your entire life savings into it? You’re playing with fire at that point. Your potential gains are way fucking lower by then.

If we were smart, we all would have ridden it up, and bought puts on the way back down. Because everyone knew it wasn’t going to sustain the price when it did hit its peak. And maybe it hasn’t, I don’t fucking know.

But this has been one hell of a ride and I will never trust anyone who tells me they know what’s going to happen.",Ragnaroktogon,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb731v/addressing_misinformation_and_bad_advice_as_i_see/glto6km/,0.069,0.85,0.081,0.4067

2701,AM," “Holding with my diamond hands! 💎 🙌🏽” he typed with trembling hands on his greasy keyboard. His girlfriend was deeply asleep next to him. She had come home late again last night after hanging out with Jake, the guy she jokingly called her boyfriend.

*When GME goes to the moon and I get my tendies, she’s going to love me again!*

His phone vibrated loudly on the nightstand next to him.  
“I’m outside,” the text preview said. Fuck!

His brother, Charles, was outside. He had completely forgotten about the family brunch - a long-standing tradition that was usually a monthly occurrence. The pandemic had pushed their brunch plans and it had now been six months since their last reunion.

He clumsily climbed out of bed. He found his jeans from last night on the floor and jumped into them. They were the only jeans that still fit him. The lightly colored denim was starting to fade. He picked a black tee shirt that was loose enough to hide his pandemic gut. It had deodorant stains, so he knew his arms would be glued his sides all day.

He watered his thinning hair. He sprinted back into the bedroom.

“Bye, baby! I’ll see you after my family brunch.""  
He leaned in to kiss her cheek but she, annoyed, dug her head deeper into the pillow so that she could keep sleeping.  
He gulped at the purple bruise with teeth marks on the side of her neck.

The black Model S was sparkling in the sun. Their father bought it for Charles as a reward for getting accepted into the same neurosurgery fellowship their father trained at.  
“That’s what you’re wearing?” Charles laughed.  
“Ha ha yeah my other clothes are in the wash.”

His brothers biceps were bulging through the expensive shirt he was wearing. A water bottle condensed onto the cup holders. Charles was the family prodigy and exuded confidence in every step.

The drive to their parents house consisted of shallow catch-up small talk. He kept his hands on his laps the entire time in order to hide the Dorito stains on them.

Images of $5,000 of expired PLTR YOLO calls came to mind.  
*If I had picked the expiration date for two weeks later, I’d be rich right now...*  
The other $5,000 his father gave him went into GameStop stock. He bought at the top, which was $350 dollars per share. It was now sitting at $80 per share.

Charles was snickering next to him with his cell phone aimed at Dale. He was recording him. Susan, their sister, was blushing and looking at her phone. Their mother was embarrassed and looked worried.

*Don’t give Charles a satisfying reaction. Stay cool. Diamond hands, baby.*

He had no idea what ladder trading was. A user named /u/PM_Me_Vagina_pics wrote that in a thread he saw earlier. Dale didn't even understand what a short squeeze was or how it worked. He barely grasped what puts and calls were and that's because Robinhood made it easy to do.

""You think you can beat billionaires at their own game?"" his dad hissed through clenched teeth. His jugular vein was bulging. Or was that his carotid vein?  
*I'll ask Charles later! He'll know.*

His dad pounded his fists and left the table.

It wasn't even 11 AM and Dale had already ruined the day. Mother was mortified. Susan was scarlet. And Charles was chortling.

i don't care what the $GME price now, and I don't care if the price even hits frickin bickini rock bottom.

why?

because stock prices most of the time do not reflect the fundamentals. if it would tesla would not have a price around $900

I'm not saying that tesla is a bad company, I personally like it, and I like Elon too.

but rn they should not trade at $900. they do because of the hype, because of the attention, and the fanboys.

and that's why we have to be fanboys and stick to this stock. even If it hits rock bottom, i believe that it can bounce easily back, and reach all time highs easily. and the reason is literally the same as with tesla. everybody is speculating that tesla will be indeed a really big and strong company.

with the CEO swap at gme, they are very likely to shift to e-commerce, and esports stuff. which is fricking huge, with all this attention behind the stock.

TLDR

HOLD BUT EVEN IF THE SHORT TIME PLAY WONT WORK, THE LONG TERM WILL DEFINITELY WILL.

Idk what increments algos use but I wouldn't be surprised if it's also multiples like this) and I still have no idea wtf a ""short ladder"" is even supposed to be. I've heard of shorts purposely dumping money into a short position at certain times to give the appearance of a price drop and spreading FUD to scare people, but the mechanical explanation of ""they're coordinating to trade the same shares back and forth with each other at super low prices"" just makes no sense. That's not physically possible. You don't get to choose who is on the other side of the trade, and if algos from other firms see such glaring price inefficiencies they'll just scoop up the cheap shares and immediately turn around and resell them at market price for a quick profit. And didn't someone post yesterday that GME is restricted from short selling by the SEC starting today?? Do people honestly think a 2-day, 70% price drop is the result of price manipulation?

2746,GME," Because not every stock looks like that. Here are 4 stocks using nasdaq.com real time trading tracker. One is GME. Can you figure out which one it is without me telling you?

https://imgur.com/gallery/rncscA9

When you see sub-penny at in nicely rounded even volumes that just means a hedge fund is in the game. Does it mean they are laddering? No, they could just be a hedge fund participating. COULD it mean they are ladder? Obviously it could.

But lets look a little more closely at GME vs. Any other stock, even the other stocks that are being traded by high-frequency traders. What you really need to look at is the price volatility. Forget volume. Forget sub-penny. Look at how much the price is swinging between trades in the link provided (or just go to nasdaq.com yourself)

The price volatility of GME suggests that there is truly a short supply in real stocks. In my linked example (which was screen shotted yesterday, and made overnight) you can see that in one particular stock price is jumping by 10 or 20 cents at a time in one particular set of trade the price jump $0.30 in a SINGLE TRADE!

That is a because very limited legitimate volume is being traded. And that is because people are still holding.

Now go look at any other stock, even the ones being traded by high-frequency traders. Even though they are being traded at high frequency and with sub-penny amounts. The price is much more stable. That's because there is a lot more legitimate volume in there to balance things out.

It IS a ladder attack. If real legitimate volume was trading. How do you get a $0.30 price gap between trades?

You have to start somewhere fundamental. I could say the same about Apple as you’re saying with GME, despite already being a trillion dollar company. 

“The market is crazy, that’s for starters... Cook, big chunk of the management, partnership with Amazon, Cook knows what he’s doing”

It says absolutely nothing except that the future _could_ be bright for the company. I can tell you right now, it would be absolutely bonkers, never-before-seen, for aapl to hit $2T. Will they continue to have good years, and thus see increases in price, based on the above? Sure! But unrealistic price targets are unrealistic.

2807,GME," If we break this down to it’s most reduced form for those with too many brain wrinkles: hedge funds can use shorting as anti-shares. They don’t have to disclose them, because there isn’t pressure to make them do so. Interest and processing profits by the MMs and clearing houses make it in everyone’s best interest to let it slide. This is problematic, because you can combine short shares, put options, and naked options to amplify price attacks. I’ll write up a really stupidly long analysis when this week at work is finally slowing down.

One of the biggest things to come out of this isn’t an “Occupy” movement; it’s that you all got a front row seat to the way the market works, due to the sheer macro size of this fuck up. I still maintain this wasn’t greed; it was failure to manage risk. Stuff about HF structures, sleeves, bundled financial products, etc. Even if you lose money, those of you smoother brains from the recent wave now have one of the greatest case studies and sources of real life data to analyze and learn from. This could make you money later. It could help balance the market playing field. At the very least, it can teach you some very valuable market components you won’t learn at the local community college.

Edit: look at my profile if you want my positions. Mods, I know it’s way late, but maybe approve some of my submissions lol. 

I bought 50 more shares of GME today. Not because of a squeeze, but because the TAM is there. The fundamentals are there. The *core idea that could make this company very valuable are there.* This is a play. It requires actual conviction. 

Last thing: this is not a call to hold it all, otherwise you are paper handed. Part of being a successful trader, even on the small scale, is taking some profit to cover your initial investment and I do not blame those of you that needed the money for being responsible. You are still personally accountable for your decision to participate. Go read up on bank roll management in blackjack if you don’t know how to manage betting money. You don’t win at the table by getting great hands; you win by managing your capital.

What's interesting is if you look at the holdings disclosures on sites like Yahoo Finance or Simply Wall Street you can plainly see that reported share ownership by institutions and insiders alone seemingly exceeds the total issuance of the company... And that's without tallying the share count held by individual investors in retail brokerages.

The disclosures are very stale as they're generally done quarterly, but a full audit of current GME holders would answer a lot of questions.",CaptainTheta,65,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb8hjc/datadriven_dd_i_analyzed_265000_rows_of_sec_short/gluanh8/,0.023,0.844,0.133,0.8957

2840,GME," I've got to assume they've been shorting it all the way down from the bubble.

If I'm a HF and a few weeks ago was caught stuck in the dryer by my step-brother, I needed to find a way out and mitigate loss / find a way to make money.... so how?!

My early calls when the stock was already low are fucked and I'm pretty well screwed on those, so how to make money to try and get to a net zero on this?

... I think first is probably let the stock fluff, fluff, fluff up and up until you can do two things; short the hell out of it again and buy absurd calls.  Then short ladder this puppy down down down gaining on new shorts as you make it drop.  Once you get to a sweet spot where the new shorts are well into the money exercise those + your original bad shorts hoping to net zero these two.  By doing this then you ignite the rocketship.... which hurts on your original calls, but those have already been offset to some degree.  When the ship using diamond handed retards flies past your $800 calls you can cash those in and instantly flood the market with share not held by retards and now you're covering your bad shorts with really good calls.  You're still for sure losing on one side, but winning on the other.

GameStop was a mall retailer before Ryan Cohen, and those were the first to be expected to die from the pandemic. GME was like $4 then. So the huge majority of short positions are like $4.

If the HF guys can drive this down and make money on re-shorting this thing along the way they should be able to heavily mitigate their loses from the original shorts, knowing their payday comes from their absurd $800 calls later on.

GME @ $300... Short @ $250; drive down, cover, make $, stock back up a bit from this volume.

GME @ $285 ... Short at $230; drive down, cover, make $, stock back up a bit from this volume

GME @ $250 ... short at $250; drive down, cover, make $, stock back up a bit from this volume

2861,GME," A call is the option to buy the underlying stock at a predetermined price (the strike price) by a predetermined date (the expiry). The buyer of a call has the right to buy shares at the strike price until expiry.

Each call gives the option for 100 shares of that stock.

Example:

You buy 10x calls on GME for $800 that expire on 3/19/2021 ... someone sells you that option but will mark it up.  Lets say their premium is $5/share.

So your cost for this is:
10 calls x 100 shares x $5/share = $5,000 for the right to buy this stock between now and 3/19/2021.

You buy.  Now you've spent $5k for the option / opportunity / etc to buy 1,000 shares of GME for $800.  If the stock is trading at $90, you woud never want to buy these and you're out $5,000... tough shit.

If the stock is trading at $1400 it would be in your best interest to exercise your option and buy those 1,000 shares.  So now, in addition to your $5k initial buy you will have to buy 1,000 x $800/share .... $800k.  

You can then sell those 1000 shares that cost you $800k for $1,400,000.

2877,RC," Two observations I have made that lead me to believe the squeeze can happen:

What is going on with the shares? 
To me there is clearly something going on with the shares and the fail to delivers. Why were euro brokers limiting buying today. It seems to me shares are scarce. The huge dip when people of certain brokers only being able to sell seems like the only time they could scrape together enough volume to have covered worst shorts. Eventually they need to exit (especially since the company is not going anywhere, add likely gonna turn around, not an ideal short target) and when they do it seems to me shares are going to be a hot commodity. 

Where is GameStop in all of this? No RC tweets nothing. Even a bad company would of offered some sort of shares, even to shorts. They could pay off debt, acquire company’s to help RC’s vision, etc. but we’ve heard nothing. This leads me to believe that someone knows something, be it they already have news coming, they know it will squeeze and they can offer then or both. For whatever reason they cancelled ICR, and dodge Cramer hounding them. Something is up.

We ALL know that gaming has seen a huge uptick in 2020 (COVID) and even before then.  How many of your friends' kids, your little nieces/nephews, your own kids are glued to a freaking screen?  Gamestop.com is now offering PC parts and there's been a lot of DD that Gamestop will start having build-a-pc kiosks which is amazing because you literally cannot do that at any other retail location. And don't forget their current online sales, they are already spectacular at 300% YoY!!  Yes, COVID drove online sales, but this isn't a dead company.  There's probably less risk buying GME at $50 than Apple at $2.   

All the short's thesis of Gamestop being the next Blockbuster was built on hubris; they've paid for that in the last few weeks.  They have again opened new short positions and those are now printing heavily, but how long will that last?  They probably still think that Gamestop is still the next Blockbuster, but it will just take a longer time to die due to the uptick of the new console release.  Short float as of yesterday 2/1/2021 was 226.42% according to this [source.](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today).  Cost to borrow was at 20-25% according to Ortex which is still insanely high. Regardless of winning position, they need to pay interest on their position.  Will that explode in their face again?  I believe it will when Gamestop has another big catalyst or there's the turn around story. 

Is the stock worth $80 right now?  I have no idea.  Is it worth $150?  No idea?  $30/share?  No idea.  Is Tesla worth almost $900?  No idea, but someone will pay almost $900/share for Tesla.  

Here's something insightful that was posted right before all this GME madness took hold.  It's a great reminder on how and why we invest.

2919,GME," if we accumulate a big slice of the share total there is absolutely nothing stopping a squeeze. Take it for example that we've had no word from GME since the whole thing started, literally anything could ignite it at this point.   
Question is, will we own enough to squeeze or will the hedgies cover again and push back? Hence why everyone needs to keep buying.

2920,GME," I will, don't worry. I've been 100% in GME for three months, got out of debt when I sold 1/3 at $500 and lucky enough to be able to put away more than $500 every month. The other investments are going to be rather boring r/investing types of investments and some hedging into precious metals (waiting out the silver PnD, don't want to get caught in that).
And yes, I put away enough for the taxman.

3029,AMC," The main thing that is hurting us here is that most brokerages are still limiting the number of shares you can buy. If we can’t get the volume we can’t drive the price up - simple as that. Wall Street know this and are using it to their advantage by carrying out ladder attacks to drive the price down, create false panic and trick people into selling.

Mark Cuban ran an AMA earlier and was asked about the Robinhood situation with limiting trades and what he would do. Here’s what he said...

‘Pick the brokerage with the strongest balance sheet. What ruined it on RH is that they didnt have enough cash to deal with the growth in accounts, margin loans and volatility. The EXACT SAME THING will happen at the next broker if you dont make sure they have a MULTI-TRILLION dollar balance sheet to be able to handle these kind of circumstances’

Both these brokerages have assets under management in the trillions of dollars:

Vanguard - $6.2 trillion Fidelity - $3.3 trillion

They WILL NOT limit the amount you can buy. They have the funds to back it up and also own GME and others in some of the funds they manage so it benefits them for the stock price to increase!

There are others with huge assets but Vanguard and Fidelity are the best options.

If anyone here does not have an account with either fidelity or Vanguard they need to open one RIGHT NOW. We can’t win with the current restrictions.

Spend the money you can only loose guys, no life savings and stuff. 

We were in this together, we had couple of rough days, i know how the psychology works, i am in my last year of medicine. It will eat you up from inside when you see the numbers falling.

We all new from the beginning its all or nothing. So don't sell and hold. We win or we loose. We are in this together. Atleast we can say at the end we tried our best. Lets these guys or bots say whatever they want, if we really stay together, we can win this. 

For the heck of it if it doesn't work out, when the movie comes out, we can stay we were the once who tried against the bully suits.

3230,GME," I'm not fucking selling. Even if this goes to 0, I'll hold, because I like the stock. 

Media? News? FUD? Red lines? Yesterday, I was worried, but today? I literally don't give a fuck. 💎👐 I believe in GME.

I don't even need the squeeze. I believe in GME, Cohen, Fidelity, Vanguard, each of you retards, the future of gaming, and lastly trust - something that the wall streeters will never understand. I don't hold a shit load of shares. I hold 54 @ 114. But that's the thing, I hold.

Instant gratification is so common these days, that people expect short returns, and give up, just when the diamond mine is 2 fucking inches away. Fight for what you fucking believe, and if it fails, try harder for the next opportunity. Perseverance will pay off. 

Do you feel alone? Guess fucking what, many of us do. That's what they want us to feel. Do you know what the most difficult emotion is? The reason people end shit? It's loneliness. You're not alone, you have the retarded autists here, we have 2 of the cleanest investment firms, Fidelity, Vanguard, we have Blackrock, Cohen, people that believe in the cause, whether financially or socially. We're individuals who like the stock, and we may not be allies, but we fight for a common cause.

What can you do to help? You don't need to risk it all, but if you have expendable money, buy fucking GME, and hold. This is possible, and for once in your fucking life, you can say you fought hard for something, and that you made a dent to the most ""elite"" fucktards on this earth, and maybe, a next generation can work off that dent to complete what we worked for.

Tomorrow, I don't give a fuck. I'm buying 50 more shares, because I want to say I've worked for this. A change happens due to a power, but that power begins from one person. Be that one person who makes a change, and be fucking proud that you did your part in something.",hwaksiliya,263,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbl62i/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_03_2021/glukfh3/,0.099,0.759,0.142,0.9571

- Movie theaters are opening again.

- Received 1bn financing to recover from possibility of bankruptcy

- Had massive chunk of debt (600m) converted thanks to the mini-squeeze caused by WSB autists (I say mini because the big one hasn't happened yet and we all know it)

- Movie theaters in China reopened to 200% increase explosion in business after lockdowns 

- The company still only has a ~$2.5b market cap at current price

Even if there wasn't the chance of the real squeeze happening (there is), this would still be a good price to buy, regardless.

3366,GME," Y'all, I'm not a part of this community, but I'd just like to say, *I believe in you guys.*

&#x200B;

Not only do you have hedge funds scrambling and trying to make the GME stock go down in worth, but you got people like **Mark Cuban actively telling you to hold the line and to keep buying GME when you can if you can afford it.**

&#x200B;

***The whole world is helping you. Everyone around the world is buying GME with you to fuck over hedge funds.***

&#x200B;

This isn't just about money, this is about taking back what hedge funds are constantly stealing from regular people through their bullshit shorting. This is *bigger* than just money; *this is about sending a message that you won't stand for shorting or hedge funders stealing money and betting on people's lives getting ruined.*

&#x200B;

***Everyone's rooting for you guys.***

&#x200B;

The hedge funders are going to try and pull every trick in the book to try and make you buy other stocks that aren't being shorted, or to make you think you're losing.

&#x200B;

**Don't fall for the tricks.** Hold the line and buy more GME if you can afford to do so. If you have to find another app or anything to be able to buy more GME do it as soon as you can, but my God, *buy more GME and hold the line.*

&#x200B;

**The world believes in you. We're all rooting for you to take these hedge funders down.**

&#x200B;

***BUY GME AND HOLD THE LINE WITH DIAMOND HANDS, YOU GLORIOUS APES! TAKE GME TO THE MOON!***

As long as your lifestyle doesn't inflate accordingly, it's actually less irresponsible for someone like that to gamble $500k than for someone who lives paycheck to paycheck to gamble $500.

These guys are usually the ones who makes a $1000 investment and does a 8% return in 10 years lmao
These guys are fucking horrible.
If we are watching only the fundamentals(according to their logic) then please tell Tesla to come down around $100. Nothing against Tesla, i love them and i love Elon, but they do not make any profit and every other car anufacturer literally makes more car than them.

The reason why the price is around $900 is because the fact that stockholders believe in Tesla's huge potential. But that is not fundamentals, that is specualtion.

Thats why, if the Gamestop stockholders believe in the future of GME, it can skyrocket to the goddamn outer rim with all this attention to the stock.

So do not fucking sell just because some BOOMER dude telling you with his laughable 8% return in 10 years that you should sell because gme fundamentals sucks right now.

And yes maybe the squeeze already happened, but the thing is, tesla skyrocketed without any short squeeze. They skyrocketed because of the stockholders and the fanboys.
