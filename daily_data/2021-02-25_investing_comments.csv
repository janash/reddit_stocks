0,DPZ," The company buys back the shares on the market, usually at times when it feels it's undervalued (say now where DPZ is at a price that matches last year at this time). It helps raise the price, usually good for the shareholder. The company is deploying what is usually deemed excess cash to invest in themselves over say an acquisition that may or may not work. It can be negative if the company is actually overvalued at the time.

The sentiment is usually good. I like it because we usually see a floor where we see the buyback start to happen (like we did with Berkshire Hathaway with their announcement).",TheGreekCoffee,108,/r/investing/comments/ls8596/dominos_pizza_announces_new_1b_share_repurchase/gopnr31/,0.031,0.857,0.111,0.8126

11,PH," Step 1) Company announces they will be buying back shares

Step 2) Understand that conceptually, capital structure shouldn't affect your valuation (market cap in this case)

Step 3) Knowing step 2 applies, if you assume flat market cap post announcement, you know share count is going to go down eventually, and market cap is currently unchanged - you can, on paper at least, guarantee that buying a share today will automatically appreciate post-buyback, giving you an arb opportunity (see: free money machine)

This also assumes that this happens in a vaccum with no systemic or idiosyncratic risk forces at present (e.g., some time between the buyback announcement and retiring those shares some value-killing event happens like PH loses some big law suit / the Fed decides to raise interest rates 200 bps).

Retail was not selling, but they were not able to buy either, so the shorts had pressure taken off of them.

So building out Semiconductor FAB (manufacturing facilities ) is expensive , SUPER expensive so unless you make millions and millions of chips its not going to be profitable and they need to spend billions on re-tooling when the next chip design comes out.

Look at it this way lets say Nintendo said ""We are going to make our own fab so we can make our chips for our devices""

They would spend 10-15 billion setting up a FAB; then they would run it for Wii U that comes out 2025. Well they just lost money because all the profit and revenue they got from the wii X was used to build their super expensive fab

Ok maybe its a forward investment in 2030 when the Wii X comes out it will pay for itself right? Nope by then they will need to spend another 10 billion to re-tool it so it can produce the latest generation chips

Also, if for some reason GOF had a bad quarter or a blow up in one of their securities, it would be likely that they would cut/suspend the dividend cratering to the stock.

100,GOF," GOF is a closed end fund that invest in (mostly) corporate bonds with lower investment grade to junk credit ratings with about 25% leverage currently. The summary I read states that the ""dividend"" is a combination of bond coupon and capital gains and the price return of ~0% since 2007 is consistent with a fund paying out all gains. 

It currently has a quite high premium for some reason. CEF's tend to trade at a discount so I'd be hesitant buying one that's at ~20% premium. 

It has equity like returns and drawdown, higher CAGR than SP500 since 2007 (11.9% vs 9.7%), similar Sharpe and max drawdown (55%), beta of about 0.5 and alpha of 8%.

Interestingly, comparing to HYG which should have similar assets GOF has a beta near 1 but still quite high alpha of 8% so there does seem to be some smart management generating alpha.

Personally, I'm skeptical of alpha so it doesn't interest me that much. I'd prefer to just allocate to an equity index fund to achieve similar return and risk exposure without relying on management skill or luck. In fact, if you run a factor analysis in https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/factor-analysis and look at the rolling regression plots you'll see that this fund generated huge alpha in 2010-2013 but alpha has steadily declined since and is approaching zero now. So the were the returns luck or maybe a unique opportunity in the recovery from the Great Financial Crisis.

GOF has a historical CAGR of around 12.88% (since inception, including you reinvesting the dividends). If we say that the 12.88% is our expectation for returns, then you’re talking anywhere from $128,800 on $1M/yr to $644,000 on $5M.

102,GOF," You might also want to check out covered called ETFs like [QYLD](https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/qyld/).  In theory, they should generate consistent income close to 10% yield regardless of market fluctuation.  Here is a [recent discussion about QYLD & JEPI](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/lquk1l/jepi_and_qyld_thoughts/)  over at /r/dividends.  You could ask about GOF over there as well.   With these types of high yielding funds, the end goal is retirement income.  So, you might care less about the NAV of the fund once you bought in.

103,NAV," You might also want to check out covered called ETFs like [QYLD](https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/qyld/).  In theory, they should generate consistent income close to 10% yield regardless of market fluctuation.  Here is a [recent discussion about QYLD & JEPI](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/lquk1l/jepi_and_qyld_thoughts/)  over at /r/dividends.  You could ask about GOF over there as well.   With these types of high yielding funds, the end goal is retirement income.  So, you might care less about the NAV of the fund once you bought in.

136,SC," Any thoughts on QCOM?  


I bought the dip pos-earnings at $146. Recently dipped more and I'm considering buying more, now that it has shown some signs of recovery and good news from SC sector.  


Pros:  
\-  Chipmaker for almost every smartphone, vehicle on Earth (and Mars). Which means is a fundamental point in the supply chain = market potential.  
\- Good PE ratio (25) compared to the SC industry  
\- It's one of the companies I know most of since I work in the sector  


Cons:  
\- Valuation downgraded due to chip shortages. It's true for Q1 earnings will be lower if Biden's act for chipmakers doesn't come soon enough. But my strategy is long so don't think it'll be much of an issue.  
\- Tech bubble and capital moving to cyclical. This is the most concerning part as we are seeing right now (forget memestocks). Which may move the price lower and recovery time will be longer.

172,GME," The thing with GME is I don't understand the game anymore. The main squeeze probably already happened. Is another squeeze coming? Maaaaaybe? But we hardly have any data to say for sure. This could be a gamma squeeze or HFs cashing in on shorts they bought at 300 or even just a more elaborate bull trap. The thing is how would we know? And what's fair market value for GME anyway? It's sure AF not 150. So this is a big game right now. And what makes me nervous is I don't know the rules anymore or have good data to act on.

The first pump, I had confidence last time that bulls were operating from a position of strength. But I just don't know anymore. What I do know is that I've seen what looks (to my unsophisticated eye) like HF rage trading. Like they aren't just taking people's money. That they're enraged. They lost billions. So they're not just looking to recoup losses. They're looking to hurt them and embarrass them. I can only imagine that some people want to crush or possibly abuse and milk WSB for all its worth. I've seen them punishing investors for weeks with almost daily bull traps. Pump the price up 10%, let bulls dump more of their money in, and then poof: take it all back. Suckers.

That's been my model of reality for a few weeks now. And I've made several hundred dollars here and there by riding waves and getting off near the top, looking for signs they were pulling out, not getting too greedy, etc. I made 50% yesterday because I saw the wave and hopped on. Can't complain. Already cashed out. Do I want to get back in? At this price?

I think... what's the upside right now if it's sitting at 150... maybe it pops up to 300 again? Ok. But you know for a fact it's coming back down (sooner or later) to about 40. So you can maybe double your money... or you can -75% your money. Is that a good deal? And things that can shoot up fast can drop just as fast. You also know the downside is guaranteed, at some point. But the upside is completely uncertain. It's super tempting, but... for me... I tell myself the smart play is do things I know, do things I understand, do things I believe in... so I'm sitting on the sidelines for now.

174,IMO," I usually call the bottom when the news is getting hyper negative, same thing for calling a top, which I did (and it's not rocket science, I'm not pretending to be an expert) a few weeks ago, where every breath Biden took got lauded as good upbeat economic news.  When the media starts parodying itself that bad, the market will shift.  We just went through a period where every little thing was seen as positive news.

Now maybe the opposite is just beginning, but it's barely started.  Hence I think we have some more room to fall.  Once the media gets super negative and the markets actually let things fall, we can bottom out.  Someone keeps buying all of these dips, which is a nice temporary relief, but I'd rather they just pull off the bandaid.  Nothing is going to ultimately stop the meme stocks from falling.

Might go up, but there are other long term risks (AAPL & IBM).  I don't see any big catalyst to make it jump up again (lawsuit is settled).  It's not cheap enough to be a value and the future 5G growth is mostly priced in.   

The auto/IOT isn't priced in (i don't think) but that's not a guarantee for QCOM and will take a couple of years. If they had kept the dividend yield up i wouldn't have sold,  but there are other values out there that will pay me to wait.

I think you have to be cautious - especially in the best case scenario where things start to get materially better - of things where if covid cooled off considerably (I think best case there's still testing that needs to be done for a long time but less) they don't have much else/anything else going on.",dvdmovie1,1,/r/investing/comments/ls372e/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gopca3d/,0.039,0.777,0.184,0.9852

Hey guys,

&#x200B;

I'm hoping someone can help me understand a discrepancy in my account. I have some GME stock through Etrade, and I wanted to figure out what my ""true"" average cost per share is. Etrade says **\~227,** but I made some small profits on buying/selling (GME), so taking those into account my **actual average cost per share** is **\~217** (i.e. that's what I'd need to sell at to break even, wiping out my previous profits).

&#x200B;

I went into my past orders to calculate this, and the total cost for all of my shares (including ones that I sold) was **$3,753**, but when I click on **Gains/Losses** on an order it says that my **total cost for GME is $5,167**. Where does this discrepancy come from?

&#x200B;

The difference divided by my current number of shares (6) comes out to roughly my average price per share, but that wouldn't be added to the cost because it is positive value for me.

Does anyone know where this discrepancy comes from?",420blazeSwag6969,1,/r/investing/comments/ls36gx/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/goqd1fg/,0.0,0.838,0.162,0.9882

Your CB is 137

Say the stock increase to 123 and you sell your entire investment

If you sell FIFO it’s a loss for 1 stock and a gain on 7, no? Or how does that work?

If it’s LIFO then it would be a gain on 7 and a loss on 1 too.

267,AB," I’m still not sure how to evaluate whether or not a stock is a good buy. I have read many theories and watched a bunch of YouTube videos on how to value stocks. Whenever I have applied any of these formulas, they seem to involve a “how much do you expect the stock to rise” multiplier. This basically leads back to me making an uneducated guess at what the stock is going to do.
I have a feeling that there are some Redditors out there that have a solid way to evaluate what a company does and whether or not their stock will go up or down. I know some of you are really on your game and I’d like mine to get better.
As an example, I saw a post on r/dividends a few weeks ago and I’m interested in AB. The PE is 12.64 and the yield is 10.61%. That said, I don’t really understand what AB does, how it makes money, whether or not they are likely to cut or raise their dividend in the future, and of course whether the share price is likely to go up or down.
How do I go about learning about these things? Any help would be appreciated.",kellislandrum,1,/r/investing/comments/ls36gx/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gor4vrg/,0.031,0.864,0.105,0.9236
268,AMC," Hi all, 

Super new to investing. I have the typical Roth that I contribute to every year but I’m starting to have money sitting in savings and doing nothing. The whole AMC/GME got me looking and learning. I’m by no means someone that likes to throw money away but I also want to invest and be smart with money that’s just sitting around. 

I’m 34 living in the US, self employed and do well for myself with no debt. I’d like to invest and build my wealth and diversify my monies. I’m happy to put money in and leave it. I don’t have any need to take any out. I live pretty simple. I just want to feel good about my future. 

ETFs seem to be my best bet with my ideology on money. But I also like the thrill of what I’m seeing with GME/AMC. I would never go over my means or money that I wouldn’t mind losing. I don’t gamble. Just not in my blood. 

If you were in my position, what would you do? Let’s say you have 10-20k that is free to spread around safely with no concerns.

275,GME," It's real hard. Yesterday I 50%ed my investment on GME in a few hours. I pulled out after hours only to see it basically go up another 50%. *I could have had that.* I have to remind myself I also could've had nothing. Hindsight in trading is a huge mindfuck. It's so easy to project present information into the past and feel like you could've done it.

Now, I make really good money at my job. I also have a massive inheritance coming my way in a few years that I do not in any way deserve. For some reason, I don't care about any of *that* money. But the 50% return I made in a few hours? It's like heroin/cocaine/drug-of-choice injected directly into my veins. I care so fucking much about those peanuts (by comparison) I made yesterday. 

Intellectually, I know this is all dancing on a knife's edge. A crash back down to earth is imminent, maybe today, maybe next week, maybe 2 weeks... but it's coming! This is why I know, the people who are the greediest are the people who are the most at risk. Those are the people who got burned last time and/or missed out on massive life-changing gains. Those are the same people who will get burned again this time. So I know, I know for a fact, that what I did (this time and last time) was the smart thing to do. I already made many thousands of dollars in GME. I need to take my gains, cash out, and parachute out of the rocket ship!

*But, oh god, it's still going up. I could do that. I can do that!* There's temptation to buy in again and keep riding the wave. But I look at all those people who bought in at 300 and ate shit. I remind myself that 50% is phenomenal. I need to turn it off and walk it away. But I know it's way easier for me because I don't even need the money. I already got my life changing money years ago. People who aren't there yet? Man, I can only imagine how tough it is to resist.... I know it's the smart thing to do. I think a lot of us do. But it's hard.

279,IMO," I'm definitely not a financial advisor, but that looks ok to me. Maybe put some of that ARKK percentage in a safer tech bet like QQQ and QQQJ. I'll also just add that small cap funds have potential for huge gains coming out of a crash/correction. For example, some funds like [UWM](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/UWM:NYSEARCA) saw a near-5x gain from the Covid crash to now (keep in mind it's riskier, [leveraged](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveraged-etf.asp), and has a fairly high expense ratio). IMO holding *some* cash to dump into a fund like that near the bottom of a downturn is smart. Passive, non-leveraged funds that are similar are VTWG, VBK, and PSCT.

Even if we don't get a full-on correction....even if the market only goes down 4 - 5%...whenever that happens, many individual stocks go down 8-10%, providing a great buying opportunity.

284,NAV," They will perform the same yes.  

Some differences are that mutual funds trade once a day at exactly the day's closing NAV as calculated by the fund, while ETFs trade on the market with a bid and ask and the price is tied to the NAV by an arbitrage mechanism. Occasionally prices of liquid ETFs can deviate from NAV, like it did for many bond ETFs last march. In those cases, it can be argued that the ETF is actually the 'correct' price while the NAV is based on stale data. Prices of ETFs with less liquidity can deviate from NAV due to the lack of trading and wider bid ask spread. Mutual funds handle fractional shares and automatic reinvestment within the fund, but many broker have added that capability for ETFs as well. ETFs are more tax efficient for funds with higher turnover because they can use the creation-redemption mechanism to trade out appreciated shares without technically selling them, while mutual funds realize capital gains and then have to distribute them to shareholders in December. (Many of Vanguard's mutual funds and ETFs are linked together so the mutual fund share class can use the same mechanism.)

294,IIPR," I think the only change will be potentially adjusting their rates. They're already working with growers to construct new facilities in partnership, which I think will be where a lot of their future business lies when legalisation eventually does come in. 

You're also assuming that banks will be itching to lend millions of pounds to cannabis growers, I just don't think that will be the case. 

IIPR is such a great solution because they can free the capital locked away in property to allow businesses to expand rapidly, which I think is going to be a very popular option once legalisation comes in. 

Also legalisation will also allow IIPR to borrow much more easily and I would argue banks would be more likely to invest in a proven REIT rather than the growers themselves.

316,DCF," This is a perspective from a long-term investor with a concentrated portfolio.  
  
Quantitative models are just one class of tool in a toolkit.  They are useful but insufficient if used in isolation.  It is very very hard to accurately predict the future, especially the further out one goes.  For example, consider a DCF on Berkshire Hathaway in the 70's--a textile mill.  Who would have had the foresight to include future cash streams from auto insurance, used car sales, boxed chocolates, electricity, railroad freight?  Recognition of the human factor would have obviously been more important in this case.  
  
In investment selection, one is trying to pick investments that are both ""worth it"" and more ""worth it"" than other options.  Quantitative financial models are only one way to go about it.  The ultimate end is one of ranking.  Exact quantitative values are not strictly necessary to rank.  In the end, one needs conviction that what is picked is likely to do better than cash, treasuries, other options they understand.  What business is likely to do better than its competitors?  What industry better than other industries?

You could also buy cash secured puts but that involves cash outlays rather than collecting premiums.  

Tesla longs have been making a killing on covered calls the past few weeks while collecting a fat premium.

That's true, but if the expected market position of Tesla is like that of BMW (or any other premium brand) today, why is it priced x20 higher?",schrowawey,2,/r/investing/comments/ls49n9/bad_news_for_nio_possibly_tsla_5k_mini/gop8ndp/,0.032,0.862,0.106,0.7834

Nio’s entry-level sedan, the ET7, has a starting price of $58,500 with a 70 kilowatt-hour battery, which can take the car 310 miles.
