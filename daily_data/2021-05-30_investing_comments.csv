We are getting a state (maybe we always were) where each sector is dominated by some biggies and absent mismanagement (Enron), or govt action (anti monopoly) or a rare event (Lehman), they are not going to disappear. However, after some point they are also not going to be able to kill their competitors. Exxon and Chevron may fade due to electric but it is unlikely they can grow to a point to be 50-70% of an ETF. I know I should never say never but the odds are low.

So what's the worst case scenario. A top company fails and the entire ETF goes down 20%. But maybe a top company just slows down or even retrenches. Imagine Microsoft back at 100, the ETF will only go down 8% (approx).

Other scenarios would be some upstart growing and becoming big. So Microsoft goes to 100 but NVDA doubles or triples and that would balance some of the fall.

23,RH," I mean people underestimate usability and its importance. 

There’s a reason people love Apple despite it being a closed ecosystem and not really super customizable like Android.

And usually companies (and elitist users) blame other users for not being sophisticated enough when these companies have been around forever and simply don’t care about user experience. 

It’s also a function of priorities. Fidelity (like Vanguard) is an Asset Manager first and foremost and a broker dealer second. So they really care much more about that part of the business. 

Fidelity also sells financial advice and so they would rather that users use their services and advisors vs. use their platforms. And they would have certainly not offered it for free without retail offerings like RH doing it first. 

Robinhood is *only* a retail focused brokerage and so clearly they’ve focused on that part of their business.

People also forget that RH is so new to the business and so such things like the liquidity crisis they had is much harder on them and it’s just growing pains. 

It’s easier for an Asset Manager like Fidelity to sell its own shares of any company’s stock that it has a position on to its clients. It’s also easier for Fidelity to handle volatility and liquidity crises because they have assets as collateral vs. RH which doesn’t (other than its equity that it can sell in exchange for capital).

Don’t get me wrong. I think RH has plenty of shortcomings but I also think they are a bit exaggerated. They are a perfectly fine and usable platform and things just work.",brown_burrito,5,/r/investing/comments/nodibt/does_anyone_buy_exclusively_sector_etfs/gzzqvax/,0.059,0.783,0.158,0.9697
24,RH," See, Apple simply works for me within the ecosystem. I have no desire to go outside. Things integrate and I don’t have to worry about having to manage things myself. For me convenience and time are worth more. 

But I also fully recognize that it’s not for everyone!

Re: RH, I mean what really are the risks? Plenty of new platforms have risks. And if you are investing vs. actively trading, does it really matter?

Even as a casual trader RH is perfectly fine for my needs. I sell CSPs and sell calls on stocks I own. I do some spreads. I’m not looking to time the top (or the bottom). I set limit prices and things get filled when they get filled. 

Obviously if I’m trying to actively trade and care about every penny then RH isn’t ideal given that their business is based on PFOF.

But I’d say for the vast majority of casual users and investors, RH is fine. Plus the no commission trades,  ability to buy fractional shares, and the ease of trading options with the usability all makes it attractive for the casual investor and trader. 

Btw, my more serious trades are all done on ATP. So in some ways I’m a bit of a hypocrite myself. But I enjoy RH for my casual and fun trading with my play money if you will.",brown_burrito,1,/r/investing/comments/nodibt/does_anyone_buy_exclusively_sector_etfs/gzzssda/,0.053,0.701,0.246,0.9942
25,VUZI," Hi everyone. I’m a new investor looking for some input on my portfolio allocation. I am 28 making about $65k a year (contributing 15% to my Roth 401k allocated to a Target date fund) and looking to invest extra $$ every month to an external taxable account (I paid off all my debt last year). I have $5k in said account right now and I am coming into about $20k of inheritance within the next few weeks. I’m looking to grow this money to use for a down payment in about 5 years.

I own a few random stocks that I bought in January with no set plan in mind. Over the past month, I’ve been doing research on how to diversify and what to buy. I’ve decided to invest mainly in ETFs to make it less complicated. Something to set and forget about, rebalancing once or twice year. Here is what I’ve come up with:

- US Equities 60% - made up of SPLG (large cap blend), SCHD (large cap value), IJS (small cap value), XLRE (real estate)

- International 35% - made up of VEA & VWO (to tilt more towards emerging markets than VXUS allows)

- Speculative 5% - keep a couple individuals stocks I own now that I like, such as VUZI and CRLBF

Should I be investing in ETFs focused more on growth instead of value? Is it worth investing in commodity ETFs to hedge against rising inflation?

I appreciate any feedback since I’m new to all this! I know there’s pros/cons to any investment, but I want to gauge my strategy based on my goal. Also looking to see if this is considered a diversified portfolio.
