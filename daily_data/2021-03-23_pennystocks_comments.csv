Wolf of Wall Street. indicators are not the end game. They are just a tool. And their applicability needs to be assessed every single time you use them. Once I stopped relying on indicators and just using a select few coupled with dd and understanding market sentiment I actually started making money. TA does not tell you where price would go. It gives you a window of where it could go depending on other catalysts. I'm always ready for my TA to fail. Risk management, position sizing and due diligence are solid. Coupled with clean TA and you have a winner.

11,DD," I have been in the stock market since the 90s but I am a fairly recent player in Penny/OTC stocks. In the past year+ of playing pennies, I have had an incredible return. I slowly invested 3.5k, 2k,1.5k, etc. over the past year. I have a total of 14.1k invested in my testing waters. My account value is sitting at 25.3k at the end of today. You are thinking, he's not doing THAT amazing, and you are right. 90% profit is not the dream everyone portrays on the sites, but for someone learning about pennies/otc I think I am doing well. Side note, I lost over 11k in one stock in the last month, I was at nearly 37k.  And you know what, that is still my favorite stock in my penny/OTC portfolio.

With the pennies/otc I have just been looking at industries where I see growth in the future. Finding companies, and doing my DD. I search every forum, to find out other's opinions, but I have made the most money, and more importantly lost less by just sticking to DD, mine, and others I have checked to be legit. The hype on these stocks killed me starting out. And luckily I was smart enough to not go big on anything that was hyped. Buy on the rumor and sell on the news is still very important, but don't see a stock that is shooting through the roof and not realize it's a pump and dump. You need to get in before that big hit. 

If that means you buy because you did your dd and have all the faith for six months while it doesn't perform, so be it. You will surely keep your eye on it for when it starts to take off. 

Trends, yes! I have definitely done well with trends. Buying in when I have my DD and believe, and watching closely. My favorite penny for this last year, KAVL, I have bought and sold a dozen times each way, It has had two huge payouts for me, followed by amazing descents where I was able to use my profits to buy every bit I could. Then again if I played those wrong, I would have sold too early. 

My thoughts are when you are up, you are up. Get out when it starts to feel really damn good. If it keeps going, well you missed out a bit, but when it falls, if you still believe buy back in. I see KAVL hitting 5-10 bucks by the end of this year. They are about to be on the NASDAQ. I first bought in barely above single digits, and after over a year of watching, selling when I am up, buying when it's down, I am sitting on a very healthy amount of shares for what I believe is going to be a very bright future.

TLDR; Do your DD, read other's DD, research any DD others have posted. Put a little in everything you really believe in, watch the trends. Look for rumors on your companies, buy up before it hits the news. Sell when you start to think you are a badass. Buy again when it dips. Hang on to stock you believe in, don't take the loss unless you are sure you want your money somewhere else. Every dollar lost is another dollar your good stock has to gain.

47,IMO," Technical analysis has been described by the best investors as being ‘reading clouds’. As in everybody sees something different. But then again some great investors admit that sometimes it can help point in the right direction, but a lot of it is like tarot card reading or glass ball reading—it’s fluff. Yet curiously enough, it’s still helpful in some instances.

48,RSI," GUYS, SOME TIPS

i disagree , not fully off course.

1. Technical analysis works most of the times !!!
2. Use Elliot waves + strong patterns like Pennants , calculate them with Fibonacci, and combine with RSI, MACD and EMA 20,50,100,200.

It is quite difficult to lose a lot. 2 deep buys max and if the 2nd Support borkes then out. Minimaze the loss.

3. Use also Monte Carlo Prediction in excel with the openings of last 5 years prices. You will be able to see the Risk Ratio for the next days with multiple scenarios to see (randomly Prices ) but, you will see the High and the Low for next 10 days

If anyone need the formula ask me, i will be glad to help.

68,TA," TA is the process of using large amounts of data gathered from over a century of trading to find patterns and gauge probabilities of outcomes. It’s just game theory applied to the stock market. 

The problem is that most people don’t understand probability. A single stock can have between 1 million and 100 million trades a day. Price action can be viewed on multiple different time scales from each individual trade up to weeks per bar/candlestick. There’s variables such as volume, volatility, short selling, options, rumors, and news. Which means that you would need billions of trades over decades across hundreds of thousands of stocks to gauge probability. 75% probability doesn’t 3 out of 4 trades have a specific outcome. It means 750 million out of 1 billion have a specific outcome. You could easily be wrong 1,000 times in a row and still not affect the actual probability. Given the number of variables, you could easily be wrong 1 million times in a row and still not affect the probability. 

Technical analysis is just statistical analysis. The problem most people have is poor risk management and improperly using the tools available.

I’m looking to lower my cost basis, and I’ve done lots of research into options and dabbled slightly in them as well with this specific stock.

If I want to sell a covered call in order to collect a premium and help lower my cost basis, let’s say I sell a $2.50 August call for $0.38 (so a total premium of $38). Between now and August, the holder of my contract has the right to buy 100 of my shares for $2.50 (meaning I make a profit because my price point is $1.52). If expiration comes and the strike price has not been hit, there is no reason for the contract to be exercised, therefore I get to keep my shares and I get to keep the $38 premium, ultimately giving me $38 that I could theoretically reinvest or put elsewhere in my portfolio.

Does this make sense to do? Is it worth it to do if I think the company has potential for long-term?

They will receive an additional $468m in milestone payments over the next few years as Azstarys goes to market and achieves various goals.  All expenses are covered by Corium.  Additionally, KemPharm gets royalty payments in the mid 20’s percent for US sales.  Their expenses are something like $20m a year, so the financial outlook is looking good for at least 5 years.

231,DD, I did some DD on this a month or so ago and posted to IHUB. Trader 53 has had this play in for a bit. Unless new news is coming out this thing is a turd. It’s been pumped twice by J. Strong and ultimately dumped. Crypto play was a 2018 pump. Just go look at John B Strongs Twitter and the comments from his share holders. Careful on this one there are a lot of bag holder.,e9cavtrooper,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/mayfqh/adtm_adaptive_media_trader53_play/gruytva/,0.034,0.809,0.157,0.836
232,ATH," On Jan 1 KAVL was less than 50 cents. Bid up to ATH in 3s by mid Feb. It was pumped like a sketchy penny stock by the people who pump sketchy penny stocks and if you bought anywhere near the top expecting it to go 1000% again youre red now. The company is solid -- already made 100 mil this year -- but the moon phase is over barring a crazy valuation upon uplisting. Its now a spec play that should offer good long term returns for buy and holds as the company expands. Its also a possible takeover target given its decent share structure and still favorable price. But another insane bull run over a few days? Not likely

I was first in at 500 @ 2.52, have been adding as price drops. Went in expecting to see profits by April or so after the uplist. Hope to double by next year or so.

234,CIDM," Well, first I don't really think that there is that much speculation. CIDM has been slowly but steadly increasing their portfolio and has consistently showed good results.

NFT's? Well, thats for sure a stretch. I can't even understand how they could benefit that much from NFT's.

Nevertheless, this for me is a slow and long term investment that later will be worth :)",jpmonteiro_pt,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/mbnsqb/cidm_stock_7_things_to_know_about_cinedigm_as/grz2tiy/,0.0,0.709,0.291,0.9655

236,ALB," LAC has got potential, they are just a development company at the moment though. If you want production you want ALB. Piedmont is getting close to production in Maryland but still a ways away. If SLB gets the plan built they will probably be 3rd on the continent. LAC is a pretty safe play though. If they can get either of their mines actually operating they will have some good upside. I don't like their Market cap at almost 2B with them not actually producing but they do have price targets at $24 which is a pretty good upside. I think you can get better gains with the smaller companies but LAC is definitely a lower risk option.",ToastTurtle,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/mbf4op/bktpf_cruzcse_cruz_cobalt_corp_news_today/grxku0q/,0.057,0.687,0.255,0.9816
