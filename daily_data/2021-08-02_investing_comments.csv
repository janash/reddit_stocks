Ofc thankfully you can max out a 401k first if you're in a higher tax bracket, getting that benefit regardless.

10,IRS," Imagine that you retire this year and making $0 in salary. 2021 Standard Deduction is $12,500 (rounded). That means if you make less than $12,500, the IRS won't require you to pay income tax. You then withdraw less than $12,500 from your traditional retirement account. If you need additional money, draw it from your ROTH which is tax-free.",cmmdrshepard2,87,/r/investing/comments/owf0zi/spreadsheet_roth_vs_traditional_401ks_and_iras/h7g071j/,0.024,0.976,0.0,-0.1027
11,IRS," TL;DR: There is a way to plan retirement income so that you get a deduction for traditional contributions while working, but you don't have to pay taxes on income when retired because your taxable income is less than the standard deduction. 

ELI5: there is a deduction that the IRS gives to everyone called the standard deduction. In 2021, it is about $12,500. Deductions are subtracted from total income when you calculate taxable income. So if you earn exactly $12,500 of income, you subtract the standard deduction on your tax return and you have taxable income of $0 and pay no taxes. 

This is important in retirement planning. Generally, the tax code is set up to tax income only once. This is the major difference between traditional accounts and Roth accounts. Traditional accounts allow you to delay taxes by taking a deduction now but paying tax when you withdraw. Roth accounts are the opposite; pay tax now, don't pay tax when you withdraw. 

So say you have a traditional 401k, when you contribute, the IRS let's you take a deduction under the assumption that it will be taxes when withdrawals are taken. When you retire, however, if withdrawals from the traditional 401k are less than the standard deduction, you don't have to pay taxes. So you took advantage of the system by getting a deduction up front but not having to pay taxes on the back end. 

Typically though, the standard deduction is not enough money to live in so you can supplement with tax-free Roth distributions to pay the rest of your bills.",bergaflical,3,/r/investing/comments/owf0zi/spreadsheet_roth_vs_traditional_401ks_and_iras/h7g8nbk/,0.022,0.913,0.066,0.7007
12,RMD," The advantage of a Roth IRA for your heirs is that they can wait until year 10 and withdraw the whole thing tax free. 

You could do the same thing with a traditional IRA, but you would have a massive tax bill in year 10.

Imagine the scenario of inheriting a million dollar IRA. Wait 10 years and withdraw the whole thing. Assuming it doubles in value over 10 years ( not an unreasonable assumption ), you would have $2,000,000 tax free from a Roth IRA. With a traditional IRA you would have $2,000,000 in income to declare in a single year. That would expose most of the inheritance to the top income tax bracket (37% currently) as well as other taxes that affect high earners that you probably didn't know existed.

That's why people often confuse the RMD rules between traditional and Roth inherited IRAs.  It's not so much that the rules are different. It's that the tax consequences of a traditional IRA effectively force most people to start taking withdrawals earlier.",carpetedman,1,/r/investing/comments/owf0zi/spreadsheet_roth_vs_traditional_401ks_and_iras/h7g8vje/,0.024,0.865,0.111,0.9398
13,USA," And if you have a taxable brokerage in the mix, and don't want to drain your Roth too fast, you can sell appreciated stock and pay capital gains tax instead of income tax.

You pay no long-term capital gains tax if your income is $40,400 if single or $80,800 if married filing jointly in the USA. So if you need $60k you could:

* 401k withdrawal of $12,500
* Taxable of $17,500
* Roth of $30,000

or something like that, giving you $60k and no taxes.

That still leaves you over $20k of space to do a rollover from 401k to Roth. You'll pay some income taxes on that, but only 12% for married filers.

I have a traditional 401k, a Roth IRA, a spousal tIRA, and taxable brokerage for just this reason. We don't know what future tax brackets will look like, so have funds in all three (though in my case, 401k and Roth IRA are the largest).",dmmagic,17,/r/investing/comments/owf0zi/spreadsheet_roth_vs_traditional_401ks_and_iras/h7g6drx/,0.05,0.867,0.084,0.7498
14,AC," I looked at the model.  It's pretty good but maybe there's a flaw. You only seem to look at implication of taxes in retirement, not during working years. If I'm correct, you're recognizing the benefits of the Roth, but not the contribution year tax benefits of the traditional plans.

Another way to look at it is you appear to be showing the taxes paid on Trad in retirement, but not the taxes paid on Roth when working.

Here's some simplified math to show what I'm talking about: Assume a 25% tax rate, $100k income, $10k contribution, here's what the contribution year looks like:

Roth: $100k \* 25% = $75k net income.  $10k Roth contribution, net cash = **$65k**

Trad: $100k - $10k = $90K adjusted income. \* 25% rate =   **$67.5k.**

**Where did the $2.5k go in your model?  That's the tax benefit of the traditional plan.  Maybe it should go in column AC as an asset? Am I missing something?**

In a normal savings scenario, it gets spent or saved invested in a normal account and then you pay capital gains tax when you cash out.  You could either accrue the tax benefit to show apples to apples, or you could invest it and tax it at capital gains rate.

Also, and it's trivial, but you appear to fail to take into account that a traditional contribution may drop someone's income into the lower marginal bracket, which while small is real.  If $15k of income is excluded from a higher bracket, approx 1% on the $15k, so $150.  Could make a model to figure out the number of people that would be covered in the gap, but not worth it.",BoredWatchmaker,4,/r/investing/comments/owf0zi/spreadsheet_roth_vs_traditional_401ks_and_iras/h7g0s09/,0.068,0.81,0.122,0.9545

16,IRS," I don't know how to say it more plainly.  

I disagree with it because **it ignores the entire tax benefit of traditional plans**\--they reduce your taxable income when you contribute. 

It's like you're saying buying a gift card and paying for dinner with it is a better deal because you don't pay after you've eaten.  Technically true but also not helpful. 

You just ignore that a person's taxable income will be thousands of dollars lower a year and they can use that money for decades to do things like, oh, invest for retirement.

In fact, economists value money in hand from deferred taxes more because it can be used for more things!  In those decades before retirement it can be invested in the stock market for retirement, or be used to pay for an education, or to pay down higher-cost debt, or a multitude of things.  With the Roth, that money you paid to the IRS is just gone.

And, after ignoring the tax benefit of the traditional plans, it shows how much money you'll save by not paying taxes on Roth withdrawals!",BoredWatchmaker,1,/r/investing/comments/owf0zi/spreadsheet_roth_vs_traditional_401ks_and_iras/h7h6txa/,0.093,0.748,0.159,0.8953

40,TSLA," ETFs can truly deviate from NAV in rare conditions, but usually deviations are simply a reflection of inadequate liquidity or inaccurate NAV/IIV (due to things like differing market closing times or stale pricing for some of the holdings). In this case, you mentioned there's no volume, so naturally the last trade price won't be very up to date. And with such low volume, market makers demand a larger bid ask spread, so trades may not be super close to NAV. But if you are tracking the bid and ask, rather than the last price, those should follow the NAV/IIV and be updated continuously throughout the day.  

You didn't mention that the fund also has OTM nasdaq/QQQ puts. Between the various OTM TSLA calls and OTM nasdaq puts, it can be tough to quickly judge how VCAR should perform just by looking at the price performance of TSLA and QQQ.

Can I link my fidelity account to the trading platform such that my share show up in Fidelity or are all of them managed in the trading platform accounts, themselves.

For example I used to work for CVS and their stock price stayed within the 50-80 dollar range I believe.

80,AAPL," I help run a direct indexing strategy for my company. Would be happy to answer any questions.

The old saying is ~30 stocks and you've eliminated all idiosyncratic risk. That's not wrong but the objective isn't necessarily to eliminate specific stock risk but to have a tracking error near zero. If you think about the S&P 500, 6% is AAPL and another 6% is MSFT, so you are going to have some higher weighted positions just based of market cap. That's why you see the Dow Jones tank on some days when other indices are up because one or two stocks brings the whole thing down. Not quite as much with the SPX but if AAPL/MSFT/AMZN are having a bad day, it's tough for the other 497+ stocks to bring it up.

We use a factor-based model broken up into something like 120 risk factors and then try to replicate any benchmark's risk factors with a buy list of stocks. So for example with the S&P 500, we use the S&P 500 as our buy list and then try to replicate the risk factors of the S&P 500, capping it at a max of 250 positions (so we always have one stock to buy when we sell another).

With a $1M portfolio and no friction (trade fees, capital gain restrictions) we can typically get the tracking error down to 40bps with that 250 positions max. IVV's tracking error is between 1 to 3 bps, obviously far superior but with zero potential for tax alpha.

Here is what it looks like

For a retail investor to do this, it's impossible in reality without paying someone. If you wanted to replicate this on your own, I would probably just focus on just trying to buy the biggest 20-30 stocks in an index since that is where most of the risk will be and just accept that you are going to run a decent sized tracking error.

Here is one with just 30 stocks and a tracking error of 2%

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/144Ewv_dwkt0WOC8qgcCtQd2c_5bRH3wDAh7WYeIC8dY/edit?usp=sharing

Looks very funky and a 2% tracking error ain't too bad for only being able to buy 6% of the SPX.

It's not going to be the initial setup that is tough, it is going to be ongoing rebalancing.

Is this all in a qualified account? One of the biggest benefits, arguably the biggest, is tax loss harvesting. So if it is in a qualified account, then I'd completely forget about all the time and effort here it would take. The LSE has plenty of SPX funds available
