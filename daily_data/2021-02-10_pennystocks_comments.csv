0,DD," I have a simple process on this sub:

1) check rising posts, see if there’s any good DD with some activity 
- if it’s quality, that means there’s legit fundamentals 
- if it’s getting hype, that means there’s people to boost the price

Then, I’ll go on fidelity and check if it’s peaked yet. If it’s still below a 15, 16% rise on the day and it’s below 1.50, I’ll join. It’s it’s already risen 80%, I’m out.

Edit: this turned into a financial advice thread, which is funny considering I’m a college student with barely any trading experience lmao. Biggest advice though: never get FOMO. If you missed the gain, you missed it, there’ll be other plays.


Edit 2: ok, some clearing up:

- **if a stock hasn’t boomed, as in it hasn’t gone up more than 25% of its original value, I’ll usually be interested trading.** The 15%, 1.50$ numbers are completely arbitrary and examples

- a very specific example to put this into context: there was what I considered a good DD on talon metals, and I was interested in buying some. Thing is, it had already gone up over 32% by then, so I missed the big gain. Today, the stock remained stagnant, so if I did get FOMO and bought in, I’d have made absolutely no money. I waited for the next play, which was NVCN today, and it went up 30%, but I got in before that! So I did make the money I wouldn’t of if I put it into talon metals.",Jcaf8,1400,/r/pennystocks/comments/lgej4s/repost/gmr45vz/,0.026,0.863,0.111,0.9408

23,PT," When you see unrealistic PTs for example. Like people were saying that FORBIDDEN STOCK will go to $1000 EOW. Or when people are making assumptions about what is happening in the market based on nothing. Or when a post about a stock is getting a lot more traction than it did before and most comments have nothing constructive to say apart from ""buying more""/rockets.

I decide on my own PTs and always sell when a stock reaches this price, of course sometimes I end up kicking myself over that if a stock goes higher but I don't let it bother me.

One time that I didn't sell at my PT was during the FORBIDDEN STOCK squeeze. I've set a PT of $300 and just held through it because the echo chamber said that it would go to 1k. Ended up walking away with a 17% gain rather than a 300% gain. Never doing that again.

Don't be scared to take profits, a 10% gain is infinitely better than holding through a peak and selling at a loss when it goes down.

When I'm setting a PT I look at fundamentals, PTs of analysts and other users and then make decisions.

Fundamentals as in things like financials, products, opinions of clients, marketing strategies, board members, insider buying/selling, institutional ownership etc. Recently I've also started looking at a company's visual presentation - if their website sucks ass then clearly they don't care about how people see them.

If a stock that I'm interested in is above my fundamental value then I'm not even getting into it.

Of course, we're standing on the shoulders of giants, so take into account other analysts' PTs and DDs because you could've missed something important.

If you want a good introduction into stock analysis then I suggest you watch RoaringKitty's videos on YT. He's the guy responsible for finding FORBIDDEN STOCK.",wawrzuu,15,/r/pennystocks/comments/lgej4s/repost/gmrdny6/,0.083,0.763,0.154,0.9714

45,EV," This year I've mostly been looking through other people's picks as I don't have enough time to look for potential gainers. This also is a good stock-picking strategy but returns are much lower and you don't have that satisfaction.

When I do have time I look mainly through fields that interest me personally because if you already have knowledge in them it's much easier to know if a company has the required potential to succeed. I'm mostly invested in EV and biotechnology stocks, sometimes weed stocks cuz I like weed.

Then I go through stock screeners, for regular, listed companies I use yahoo, finviz, tradingview, marketwatch and stock-screener. For OTCs I use mostly OTC Markets. On those sites you have to set indicators that interest you, so you already have to know what they are and what they mean.

If I find something interesting I start looking deeper into that company. I review what I've written in my previous comment, charts etc. I use mostly the same sites that RoaringKitty uses, which are whalewisdom, openinsider, yahoo finance, seeking alpha etc (just go watch his videos). Then I look through social media because recently the DDs posted e.g. on Reddit are of such high quality that they even surpass articles posted on seeking alpha. Also social media acts as a way of checking if I'm still in stealth mode or if there's already noise around the stock. Also I check if I may know something about that company and/or field that others do not, based on my own knowledge and experience (this is extremely rare).

If a stock had big price fluctuations then I try to find reasons behind them and if they'll have any effects in the future.

If I decide that this company is worth investing into I put it on my watchlist and keep an eye on it for a few weeks IF it's gonna be a long hold. During that time I look for things that I might've missed, watch the noise around the stock etc. If I'm investing short-term and the potential's there I invest right away. This may be irresponsible but didn't burn me yet.

If everything looks alright after all of that I buy the stock or CFD and hold it until it reaches my PT or something changes within the field/market/company that doesn't float my boat. For example, FORBIDDEN STOCK was a long hold at the beginning and then it squeezed out of nowhere, the market changed, it was time to bail - I didn't and got burned. Now I won't buy again since it's above my set fundamental value.

Try to find out which investment style suits you and then pick stock gurus that use a similar one. This'll allow you to learn more AND find potentially good stocks more easily.

Then I go through stock screeners, for regular, listed companies I use yahoo, finviz, tradingview, marketwatch and stock-screener. For OTCs I use mostly OTC Markets. On those sites you have to set indicators that interest you, so you already have to know what they are and what they mean.

If I find something interesting I start looking deeper into that company. I review what I've written in my previous comment, charts etc. I use mostly the same sites that RoaringKitty uses, which are whalewisdom, openinsider, yahoo finance, seeking alpha etc (just go watch his videos). Then I look through social media because recently the DDs posted e.g. on Reddit are of such high quality that they even surpass articles posted on seeking alpha. Also social media acts as a way of checking if I'm still in stealth mode or if there's already noise around the stock. Also I check if I may know something about that company and/or field that others do not, based on my own knowledge and experience (this is extremely rare).

If a stock had big price fluctuations then I try to find reasons behind them and if they'll have any effects in the future.

If I decide that this company is worth investing into I put it on my watchlist and keep an eye on it for a few weeks IF it's gonna be a long hold. During that time I look for things that I might've missed, watch the noise around the stock etc. If I'm investing short-term and the potential's there I invest right away. This may be irresponsible but didn't burn me yet.

If everything looks alright after all of that I buy the stock or CFD and hold it until it reaches my PT or something changes within the field/market/company that doesn't float my boat. For example, FORBIDDEN STOCK was a long hold at the beginning and then it squeezed out of nowhere, the market changed, it was time to bail - I didn't and got burned. Now I won't buy again since it's above my set fundamental value.

Try to find out which investment style suits you and then pick stock gurus that use a similar one. This'll allow you to learn more AND find potentially good stocks more easily.

Oh and I always do two DDs, one bullish and one bearish. It's good to know the potential risks.",wawrzuu,6,/r/pennystocks/comments/lgej4s/repost/gmrq9ej/,0.043,0.862,0.095,0.9779

134,DD," I’ll add another tip.  If you like a particular industry, solar, wind, battery or bio... find a reputable blog or web page for industry information and sign up for alerts.  Yup, a lot of noise comes in, I use a different email for those and specifically use it for only that purpose.  The penny game is about information.  By the time it’s posted on here or other platforms is usually tardy to the party.  

 If a bio company has entered into an agreement with a major pharmaceutical company, I want to know that instantly or as close as I can get to that. When I first started I bought based on posting “news” that many times was a day or more stale. Stock popped and I bought in on the rise.  No bueno.   

Information is power as you’re aware, and new information is more powerful than old.  Stay informed and stay green.  You won’t win them all, I sold a loser this morning.

135,DD," For how long do you usually run them before pulling out? Especially if you don't get a perfect entry when it trades sideways. Even if there is good DD out there and everything lines up, if the stock already jumped like 200% I am really concerned about it resulting in the typical ""buying high, selling low"" meme, even if the catalyst / analytics haven't changed. 

So it might end up correcting by -40%,-50% before going the remaining 300% that were predicted but I feel like that with pennystocks cutting losses is even more important as they tend to either rocket up, or crash down unless you want to bag-hold it. 

Might something like a 2% stop-loss and seeking for a re-entry at the next upwards trend be recommendable? After all, \~9 re-entries after a -2% stop loss was triggered roughly result in the same -20% loss compared to letting it run, while a total of 10 entries after a recovery has a higher chance to net an actual profit, rather than bag-holding at -20% hoping that the run wasn't over yet.",Gaenyeon,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/lgtx7y/tips_and_tricks_to_investing_in_penny_stocks/gmtom93/,0.106,0.771,0.124,0.5574

138,DD," Thank you for the good advice. I'm very new to the world of trading. I'm curious about some of the points in your post.

1. I'm still very ignorant to many things about the way""money"" works in general. A weakness I'm overcoming is my need to ""see it or hold it to believe it"" so most of my money sits in a savings account or is ""buried under an old oak tree"" So where does your money sit in your account that isn't activity invested or ""holding shares? I'm assuming that no every cent is being invested at all times. Where is it when it's between trades? Also, where do you like to put your profit when you graduate it from your ""Penny Stocks""? Is it good to shift into some more stable stocks? Do you put it right into checking and grab it at an ATM machine? What's a smart way in your opinion to treat your gains here?

2. You mentioned cross referencing Reddit trends or whatever catches your eye with analysts for a 2nd opinion. Who is that? I'm just ignorant like I said but I'm wondering if that's a personal broker, some official board somewhere, a YouTube channel you have confidence in? If I were to decide to try the same method on stocks that catch my eye, what are good resources in your opinion? I find myself scrolling Yahoo finance looking for gossip and making guess work on the graphs but that's about the extent of my DD at the level and time I have to commit. Any suggestions there?

If you're entering a trade without having a point that you're going to cash out or no idea what your expectations are for the stock then you need to do some more DD. Even if you're reasoning is ""I think this stock is going to double solely because of the speculative attention around it"" that's better than nothing.

-they have the biggest production of all the projects in the western world (100k tons/year vs 40-50k tons of others)

Usually people post their DD after they’ve already invested in a stock early prior to the run up. 

I think I know which poster, who actually posts great detailed DDs but the timing of when you invest is key. Yesterday I invested in one of them after doing quick research but it free fell today. I did more research today and noticed that said company had an **ongoing class action lawsuit from existing investors**! It doesn’t come up immediately but I saw this from someone on Stocktwit and it shows up when you google “company scam”.

239,CD," This person gets it! They get it. Let's see the reasons we have to speculate to pay off our mortgages. One's ability to get access to the financial ecosystem is mainly predicated on two inputs: What you make (wage) and What you get when you save (interest.)

**Wage**: Limited growth in take home pay for middle class: '  Over the 1979-2018 period, real wages at the  10th percentile of the hourly wage distribution grew by 1.6%, whereas wages at the 50th percentile grew by 6.1% and wages at the 90thpercentile grew by 37.6%. ' [https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46212](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46212)

Rich got richer. Middle class got smaller. Poor are more poor

**Savings - Interest Rates**: In 1990 a 5 year certificate of deposit (remember those?) yielded about 7.5%. In 2020? The same 5 year CD yielded about .5 or Half of a 1%) My 1% milk has a higher yield. Did I mention I can only afford the milk from Aldi? As such, to obtain 1990 interest  income you have to save 14 times the amount today. Hard to do when your wage increased 6.1% over 40 years.

&#x200B;

To  add, since RogueNC is probably unfamiliar if they don't know a regular  stop loss, you can set a trailing stop to help you maximize profits. I  did this today with CRSR, there was an earnings report and big stocks  often go down with earnings reports. So, knowing it was going to go  down, i set a trailing stop order at 0.25 cents or something.

What  that means is that, since it was a purchase order and i set a 0.25  trail, it the order followed the price movement going down, and down and  down, but when it went up by 0.25$ from its lowest point (which i  decided would be the decisive end of the dip), it would trigger to buy. I  set the order around $43.80, and it followed the price down to a low of  around $41.90, and then it started going up and my trailing stop kicked  in and purchased my order at $42.15. It's now up to $45.15 after hours,  3 dollars per share and i bought a number of shares, so with profits  locked in i'm setting another trailing stop order for selling. It works  the same way but backwards - It will follow the price climb higher and  higher, but if it dips down below a certain threshold i set (dollar  based or percentage), it will automatically sell, so i don't miss a huge  crash in price and get left holding shares.

I literally learned this today, and put it into practice on CRSR and it's payed off well. Good luck!",Digital_Ctrash,21,/r/pennystocks/comments/lgifxw/pennies_list_29/gms9mmv/,0.036,0.803,0.161,0.9845

Overall, their financials look good and the product looks good, but I feel like we're seeing a pennies bubble right and it is making it hard to fairly value anything when \*everything\* is up. Does the Fed's free money continue to drive up all asset classes or does (ie when) something come along to shake us out of ""irrational exuberance"" soon?

Company Phone Number is 602-502-0603

Business Address

20 E. THOMAS ROAD, SUITE 2200  
PHOENIX AZ 85012 

A search of the address shows it to be in the Century Link tower but in a Co-Work space in that tower.  If you're not familiar with Co Work spaces, they are workspace and offices you can rent, generally monthly.  They are great for someone who is just getting started in business or a satellite office in a town you work in from time to time.  

The phone number is a Verizon Cell Phone number belonging to Beningo Pineda in Phoenix, AZ.  I couldn't find any information on this guy.

Gran Tierra Energy Inc, a company focused on oil exploration and production in Colombia and Ecuador, today announced the Company's 2020 year-end reserves as evaluated by the Company's independent qualified reserves evaluator McDaniel & Associates Consultants Ltd. (""McDaniel"") in a report with an effective date of December 31, 2020 (the ""GTE McDaniel Reserves Report"") and an operational update.

All dollar amounts are in United States (""U.S."") dollars and all reserves and production volumes are on a working interest before royalties (""WI"") basis. Production is expressed in barrels (""bbl"") of oil per day (""bopd"") or bbl of oil equivalent (""boe"") per day (""boepd""), while reserves are expressed in bbl, boe or million boe (""MMBOE""), unless otherwise indicated. All reserves values, future net revenue and ancillary information contained in this press release have been prepared by McDaniel and calculated in compliance with Canadian National Instrument 51-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities (“NI 51-101”) and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (""COGEH"") and derived from the GTE McDaniel Reserves Report, unless otherwise expressly stated. The following reserves categories are discussed in this press release: Proved Developed Producing (""PDP""), Proved (""1P""), 1P plus Probable (""2P"") and 2P plus Possible (""3P"").

Commenting on Gran Tierra's 2020 year-end reserves, operational update and future plans, Gary Guidry, President and Chief Executive Officer of Gran Tierra, said: “Our teams in Colombia, Ecuador and Canada rose to meet the many challenges of 2020 through their diligent management of COVID-19 safety protocols and sharp focus on maintaining and increasing the value of our assets. As a result, we are pleased to announce significant reserve additions in both the PDP and 1P categories, despite our large reductions in capital investment during 2020. This achievement demonstrates that the Company's core conventional oil assets continue to show positive waterflood responses and low base decline rates.

The advancement of our waterflooding efforts in the Acordionero, Costayaco and Moqueta oil fields has clearly allowed Gran Tierra to continue to convert Probable and Possible reserves into the Proved reserves categories. Even though we decided during 2020 to reduce capital spending, we believe the Company's excellent performance in terms of PDP and 1P reserves additions is a testament to the quality of our assets.

With our strategy, we believe Gran Tierra is well-positioned for the resumption of prudent growth in 2021 and strong potential free cash flow1 generation. We have already increased production approximately 24% from our third quarter 2020 average, which we believe reflects the strength of our Proved reserves. Our 2021 capital budget of $130 to $150 million is a balanced, returns-focused program which prioritizes free cash flow generation over the rate of development, exploration and production growth, with investment primarily directed to the Acordionero and Costayaco oil fields. With a keen focus on further strengthening our balance sheet, we plan to direct free cash flow to ongoing debt reduction in 2021 and beyond.

During fourth quarter 2020, Gran Tierra resumed development activities throughout our portfolio, including the ongoing well workover operations and the restart of development drilling at Acordionero. We also restarted workover operations at Costayaco and look forward to a planned initiation of development drilling in that field during second quarter 2021. We forecast 2021 average production of 28,000 to 30,000 bopd for the Company.

Our 2021 plans are fully aligned with Gran Tierra's ""Beyond Compliance Policy"" which focuses on our commitments to environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") excellence. Gran Tierra looks for significant opportunities and benefits to the environment and communities by voluntarily and proactively taking steps to protect the environment and provide social benefits because it is the right thing to do. In 2020, we also had our best safety year in the history of the Company.

We believe that Gran Tierra successfully navigated the exceptional challenges of 2020 and are excited to return to an economically sound growth trajectory in 2021 and beyond, with a focus on free cash flow generation and debt reduction.""


-> During 2020, Gran Tierra achieved:
Material PDP and 1P reserves additions, in particular at Acordionero, Costayaco and Moqueta, as a result of ongoing successful waterflooding operations

PDP reserves replacement of 133% with PDP reserves additions of 11.0 MMBOE
1P reserves replacement of 100% with 1P reserves additions of 8.3 MMBOE

Finding and development costs (""F&D"") including future development costs (""FDC"") of $5.06/boe on a PDP basis and $2.65/boe on a 1P basis
F&D recycle ratios including FDC of 3.5 times (PDP) and 6.7 times (1P)

Significant reserves additions at Acordionero: 7.1 MMBOE (PDP) and 2.6 MMBOE (1P)
Despite a material reduction in the McDaniel's forecast oil price assumptions relative to one year ago (the average Brent oil price over the next 5 years in the GTE McDaniel Reserves Report is $54.04/bbl):
Gran Tierra's 2020 year-end 1P NPV10 after tax decreased only 21% compared to 2019 year-end
This performance was achieved in part due to large reductions in forecast operating costs based on the actual savings achieved by the Company in 2020
As of December 31, 2020, McDaniel estimates that Gran Tierra's total 1P undiscounted operating costs over the remaining life of the Company's fields are approximately 26% less than the McDaniel estimate as of December 31, 2019*

Acordionero, Costayaco, Moqueta and Suroriente now represent 83% of Gran Tierra's 1P reserves and 78% of 2P reserves

PDP reserves account for 55% of 1P reserves and 1P reserves account for 59% of 2P reserves, demonstrating the strength of the Company's reserves base and the potential future conversion of Probable reserves into 1P reserves and Proved Undeveloped reserves into PDP reserves

Gran Tierra's mature waterflood assets, Costayaco and Moqueta, continued to grow and deliver value, with total reserves additions of 3.8 MMBOE (PDP) and 5.5 MMBOE (1P)

FDC are forecast to be $312 million for 1P reserves and $565 million for 2P reserves
Realized a 39% increase in 2P reserve life index to 17 years and a 51% increase in 1P reserve life index to 10 years",Dorf_man7,8,/r/pennystocks/comments/lgovvi/daily_plays_february_10_2021/gmuck6j/,0.009,0.866,0.126,0.9988

**The Summary**

FLWPF is currently trading at $0.45 at the time of writing with a PT of $2.20. It has 2 buy ratings and a PT of $3 by MKM and $1.4 by Altacorp.

MAIN CATALYST: Merger with Terrace Global in October'20 (A multinational company focusing on the development and acquisition of international cannabis assets.) valued at CA$63m. This is expected to improve FLWPF balance sheet by 18M and reduce debt by 11M. There was little price movement during this merger perhaps in particular due to lack of coverage and volume. 

**About the company**

We focus on producing premium cannabis products for medical patients and recreational consumers throughout Canada, utilizing its purpose-built indoor and outdoor cultivation and processing facilities located in the city of Kelowna in the Okanagan Valley Region of British Columbia, Canada (the “Kelowna Campus”). Flowr is currently focused on producing, marketing and distributing premium dried cannabis flower products (i.e. packaged dried cannabis flower and pre-rolls) and intends to strategically offer new product formats such as cannabis oils, vape technology, edibles, beverages and topical products, as demand patterns evolve. We believe demand for new product formats will consistently grow and that many of these products are best when infused with ingredients derived from greenhouse and/or outdoor grown cannabis which can be achieved through our various facilities. 

\- FLWPF has operations in Canada, Europe and Australia. This is expected to grow in both size and coverage with the acquisition of Terrace Global.

**The Good**

\- As many would have already realized, there is a strong movement towards the legalization of MJ. The demand for MJ has also increased YOY in Canada and is expected to be a multi-billion dollar market in several years time. 

\- FLWPF has demonstrated a 100% increase in YOY revenue since between H2 of 2019 - 2020. This is expected to rise after the aquisition of Terrace Global. Expect positive news in Q1 2021 earnings. 

\-Strong leadership team: CEO is Tom Flow was previously co-founder and Chief Operating Officer at MedReleaf (Currently trading at $18), and currently sits on the board and advisory committees of several cannabis-related companies. 

\-60% share are currently owned by management.

**The Risk**

\- FLWPF has yet to demonstrate any positive earnings. This has improved tremendously over 2 years with the latest EPS at -0.06 (previously -0.12). Nevertheless, I felt its important to share this information for your own dd. 

\-There are plenty of MJ companies out there - some will be/has shown to be amazing winners but many more will fail. However, this is the risk you have to take with these growth markets. 

\-FLWPF to the best of my knowledge has not shown to have any news on entering the US market but this may change with the new utility of Terrace Global.

   
 

**Conclusion**

\- Overall, I am bullish on this company. The presence of a well thought out website and sensible company decision making makes me think that this is not one of those pump and dumps. 

\- The focus on medicinal marijuana is of better interest to me as there is more research in that area currently with good upside potential.

\- I believe as noted in the title, this stock is likely to flourish and its stock price is expected to reach its PT at $2.20.

Essentially KTRA is positioned with two Phase-3 ready drugs - these are VAL-083 and REM-001.
VAL-083 has been designed to treat a common, yet aggressive brain cancer; glioblastoma (GBM).
REM-001 has been designed to treat metastatic breast cancer.

VAL-083 is currently conducting clinical trials.
REM-001 has undergone Phase 2/3 trials already and is moving on to late stage testing. I believe the clinical efficacy is around the 80% mark.

So wrt products - we should hopefully be receiving news in the near future.

In terms of funding, this is a big bonus for KTRA as they are funded up to 2024 - which coincides with around the time the company should start really turning a profit. They have cash balances in the region of 22 Million USD and have debts of only 440k USD (around the 2& ratio mark).

I wont ignore the recent very short term momentum from Reddit and other platforms - this would benefit a short term rise on speculation and possible news. 

I believe that compared to other similar companies, KTRA is undervalued and could easily be twice the current market cap and compare well against others. My plan is to ride this trend/momentum and news - take profits of initial stake TP: $5.25) and keep the rest as a medium term holding until at least 2024.

In terms of funding, this is a big bonus for KTRA as they are funded up to 2024 - which coincides with around the time the company should start really turning a profit. They have cash balances in the region of 22 Million USD and have debts of only 440k USD (around the 2& ratio mark).

I wont ignore the recent very short term momentum from Reddit and other platforms - this would benefit a short term rise on speculation and possible news. 

I believe that compared to other similar companies, KTRA is undervalued and could easily be twice the current market cap and compare well against others. My plan is to ride this trend/momentum and news - take profits of initial stake TP: $5.25) and keep the rest as a medium term holding until at least 2024.

I know that was brief - but hopefully gives you something to start on.

573,DD," For how long do you usually run them before pulling out? Especially if you don't get a perfect entry when it trades sideways. Even if there is good DD out there and everything lines up, if the stock already jumped like 200% I am really concerned about it resulting in the typical ""buying high, selling low"" meme, even if the catalyst / analytics haven't changed.

So it might end up correcting by -40%,-50% before going the remaining 300% that were predicted but I feel like that with pennystocks cutting losses is even more important as they tend to either rocket up, or crash down unless you want to bag-hold it.

Might something like a 2% stop-loss and seeking for a re-entry at the next upwards trend be recommendable? After all, \~9 re-entries after a -2% stop loss was triggered roughly result in the same -20% loss compared to letting it run, while a total of 10 entries after a recovery has a higher chance to net an actual profit, rather than bag-holding at -20% hoping that the run wasn't over yet.",Gaenyeon,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/lgltvk/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gmtopcb/,0.106,0.771,0.124,0.5574

* Stop losses kicking in because of the dips today (making the dips even worse because of the selling)

* Active shorting going on this week

* Market correction because of the recent highs

648,TD," OTC means over the counter. A lot of penny stocks mentioned here are not approved to be traded on the Nasdaq. Robinhood very rarely if at all allows traders to trade on OTC positions because they’re such high risk. 

Right now everything is great and any blind monkey is making money, but sadly, a lot of people in these positions will over leverage, “buy the dip”, then be down thousands of dollars wondering what went wrong. 


OTC’s are incredibly volatile often swinging 30-50% a day. 

I use TD for them and pay the $6.95 on trades because it makes sure I’m confident when I want to buy or sell and they update quickly and don’t have reading or cash restrictions like fidelity does for a lot of their OTC stock. 



If you invest in an OTC stock have a plan because if you just yolo buy dips you could be looking at a destroyed position.

The recent growth has been nice, but this was a longterm play for me. Im glad others are starting to see the potential.

DDC, to my knowledge, is not on a path to FAA type certification with any of their platforms.   They won't be operating for profit in the US without this.  They'll need the type cert for their air vehicles  (small UAS is easier to get than one for their Condor aircraft)  and they'll also need a Part 135 certificate to be an air carrier.   They're going to face a lot of competition in the US from bigger and better companies....

707,DD," Not investment advice, but to my mind it is natural to take losses on some highly volatile stock. Stop Loss selling is a method to mitigate those losses. 
Red days are inevitable on any stock especially when there is an offer of stock from the company themselves. Which may be seen as a positive moving forward.
That being said if it is a stock that you did DD on and agree that it has a profitable future the Stop Loss settings might be worth being more aggressive with (closer to your purchase price or even a bit below and bite the bullet).
If it is a stock that is riding the buzz it is best to set your stop losses at a smaller percentage dip. Dependent on what percentage gains you have seen in any stock I agree that closer to 30% loss is the more appropriate Stop Loss for a penny stock (of which often see larger dips).
Of course if you are good at judging the market and the buzz around a stock it is best to just sell near your assumed limitations of any stock and buy back in near your assumption to the bottom of the dip or as the stock begins to turn.
However, as the OP stated there is always other stocks to invest in if the future of any stock is questionable or a wild ride has you nervous about setting yourself up for failure.
If you fail to sell prior to a dip or buy in too high one can always double down on a DD stock to lower your average purchase price, but only if you have good reasons to assert the price will continue to climb into the future.
All you can do is make educated guesses and limit any losses.
Investing is a gamble. It is a game of winning more games than you lose and of the ones you win winning with a far higher percentage than those you lose.
The Short Sell Squeeze strategy of buying and HOLDing is only a decent strategy if you are all in for a ride to the moon or a dive to zero.
Be wise! Do good DD! Think deeply into future value of stocks! Set Stop Loss limits! 
Best of luck to all (including myself).",socialgovernance,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/lgrwkz/short_psa_dont_be_mad_at_yourself_newbie/gmulyry/,0.15,0.682,0.168,0.9493

Both way smaller than the current offerings, last longer, and the Libre is getting an update to be able to transmit data live. They’re both out this year, Libre 3 potentially very soon as it has a CE Mark already.

715,DD," As a type 1 patient using the FreeStyle; I've read a DD before, it all looked good from a financial point of view, but personally I would never switch and would never buy the stock. It apparently has better readings but is has such serious disadvantages that I doubt that they can ever appeal to the larger group:

\- The sensor needs an incision, there is a chance at infection, not worriesome but it's just not something you want if you can avoid it.

\- 180 days sounds nice, but actually, it's not. Two reasons:

1. The device is worn on the outside of your arm, it happens that you hit doors, or other objects. I've had several in the last couple of years that malfuntioned because it was damaged. You don't want to get a new incision, and insurance probably only covers two a year.
2. Your skin will get seriously irritaded, already after 2 weeks, I don't want to think about 6 months.

\- It's big in size in comparison to the FreeStyle

\- Type 1 patients are conservative when it comes to medication and measuring equipment, they have to adjust their life to it, changing medication or measuring equipment is not something you want to do. The potential advantages have to be quite big, I don't think this is the case. These readers are typically not for type 2 patients beacuse type 2 parient are (in most cases) not insulin dependant (or at least not insured in most countries/policies).

\- I don't know if the Eversense is approved (or going to be approved) for children, if it's not, what I said, type 1 patients are conservative.

Where I’m at right now, the past month, the only places I have been are the hospital, the GP and the pharmacy. The idea of more doctor visits is a barrier to entry.

I’m currently doing glucose tests about 7-8 times a day, partially because I’m a data nerd, so applying a sensor once every week or two with an easy applicator is not a problem if it means I can stop doing that.

So Mr Smooth Brain, let me help you with your blatant misinformation.

>covid theraputic that can be administed like flonase that is showing very promising clinical results this will be there first profit on the market with a product they are very close to producing it at this point

First of all, they literally just got approval to ENTER phase 3. If you know anything about the FDA process, you know this is where drugs go to die. This is far from a sure thing. Honestly, it seems more likely to fail than anything else. It acts by a mechanism that we already use with moderate efficacy, if any. There's no reason to believe this will succeed based on past experiences. 

>drug called Endoxofin that is showing a 74% reduction in cancerous cells. Endoxofin has passed phase two trials early because of the huge results that were seen

No. This drug just got early approval to end phase 1 trials. Once again, if you understood this process at all, you would know phase 1 is basically lab bench trials. Plenty of drugs get hurried along because they work so well in a petri dish. Not many drugs do well beyond that. This won't be in the market for at least 2 years, if not longer. Cancer drugs typically take longer to market because, well, the nature of cancer. We typically want measures like 5-year survival.

Artificial Intelligence is an upcoming sector that's only going to get more widespread as our society continues to technologically advance. We generate billions of data each day, but the data is meaningless if we don't know how to make sense of it. 

Sonasoft has made a pivotal direction to focus entirely on AI in 2018. I'm really excited on their platform called Nugene. Nugene allows data engineers to build AI bots to streamline their process in analyzing all their data. The bots essentially aggregate data and build different models to find solutions to specific problems. The cool part is this platform can be used to analyze raw data in any different sector (Finance, Industry, Tech, etc...). Although this has yet to bring significant income, I believe that will considerably change in the future esp with all the R&D going into it. 

In fact, I encourage you to read about their AI software program and their impact on Delaware Electric Cooperative (DEC). Using Nugene, DEC was able to reduce electricity costs for its members by 1.3mil! They were able to do so by using Nugene to accurately pin-point large peaks in which demand for electricity was highest. This allowed DEC to inform members at which time points to reduce electricity (dubbed ""Beat the Peak"") to avoid a demand surge and hefty costs. 

Overall, I feel like this is most likely the start for SSFT and most definitely think there is tremendous growth in store for them. Of course, take my opinion with a grain of salt. 

Hope that wasn't too long.

I'm also not in the AI field so I don't understand anything having to do with it. I guess I wanted to know why anyone feels that their tech is for sure better than any possible competitors' tech, and I was also wondering why after their past partnership announcements with google they had a slight rise and then they went right back down *after* the Covid crash. I'm hoping this time there is an uptrend for good but I just don't know what else could prop this stock up unless they keep announcing more big partnerships/customers in the near future.",yarnafnaf,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/lgii2d/does_ssft_have_further_to_go/gmsi53f/,0.014,0.899,0.086,0.7506
853,AI," Definitely a disruptive technology.

Reasons why I believe their tech is for sure better than any possible competitor's tech:

1. I work in supply chain management, which is essentially the industry of everything. In case you aren't familiar, if more than two companies are involved in producing and selling a product/service, it has a supply chain.

2. ERP systems/an enterprise system (SAP was the first and is still most used) were the last thing to truly revolutionize supply chains. Oracle offers the second most popular, NetSuite, which we use where I work. You can read up on these, but they streamlines business processes at all organizational levels. With confidence, I'd speculate most companies with true supply chains use a version of these regardless of size. 

3. Nugene is essentially AI for the existing robot (the ERP system). You know what the difference between data, information, and knowledge are? Data is bits of facts, information is giving the data context so you can understand its meaning, knowledge is what allows you to interpret and analyze the information. ERP systems have data and information. This gives it the knowledge aspect.... and they HAVE A PATENT

4. It will be able to access and analyze data down to the functional level of businesses at once. Once it hits an industry, other companies in the industry will need it to stay competitive. Supply chains. exist. globally.

5. Big tech. Big pharma. Finance. Auto. Grocery chains. Construction. Microsoft. Google.. EVERYTHING. Europe, China, Japan... EVERYONE

This is the key to truly automating supply chains. Holy $hit, I can't believe I'm getting in under a $1. I have a gut feeling this is the next big tech, but what do I know.

Current ERP systems streamline business processes by serving as giant databases that allow decision makers/interconnected business units/different companies in the supply chain to have access to all relevant information to do their jobs efficiently. 

It currently does this by ""mapping"" the connected data which requires a developer or specialist at the company or ""Suiteapps."" Sometimes, the good apps cost money, but it is really all more about business integration, not automation. 

>And do the systems that you use right now use sonasoft AI or are you saying that they would be better with the AI?

No, they don't. AI wouldn't just make them better, they would disruptive the industry. Think of Java. Different companies could incorporate it into their program. Id argue companies who didn't would become obsolete. 

Things I love about Nugene, which they have patented. 

1. Machine learning. It would take the process of customizing and tailoring ERP systems to individual company's needs (our COO argued the other day that at this point we couldn't switch from Netsuite if we wanted) and shorten it dramatically because Nugene would have access to/ process all data simultaneously and continuously. They say it can be done in 4 weeks. I believe it. This currently takes 6+ months. Plus, everytime your needs change you have to go and completely remap things. 

2. Anomaly prediction. I'd love this at my job now.

3. Demand Forecasting. Predicting trends (seasonal) in data. It would also give you visibility to fluctuations in supplier lead time. I'd think you could integrate it with weather apps to even predict weather systems that could affect logistics.

894,CEO," It hasn't taken off, because there is no real business at this point in time. 

I'm very sceptical about AION and ""psychedelic stocks"" as a whole at this point in history. I've been into psychedelics and following the research for years and I just don't think psychedelics will be the next ""weed"". it's an entirely different beast all together. 

Most people don't take psychedelics daily/weekly recreationally. Most people take it once or twice, then doesn't touch it for years. For therapy, the very reason why psychedelics is so promising is exactly because you don't need more than a few sessions for it to work. Unlike weed and traditional medicine where you take it continually. 

To me AION looks like a classic hype stock scheme. By just looking at the link you posted it includes ""weed, psychedelics and AI"" all in one section - it's almost a parody of how can we cram in enough buzzwords in one business strategy.

I love psychedelics and I think the future of psychedelic research is super interesting. I just don't think there is any viable business strategy out there in the foreseeable future. Soon MAPS will bring MDMA into mainstream therapy. It's super exciting and psilocybin has some very interesting research being published these years. If you ask any of the real players in the psychedelics research field, I bet you most of them haven't even heard of AION. Why would they? they haven't done anything and their intuitions about psychedelic research seems rather uninformed and inexperienced.

I'm also very sceptical about the whole mixing cannabinoids and different psychedelics together for therapy. I don't see the reasoning behind it at all. Seems like they have no experience with psychedelic therapy whatsoever.

Also the CEO seems like a tool who doesn't know what the fuck he is talking about.

944,LB," Long and strong folks. I’ve been in since last May. So much work going on behind the scenes. This JV between electrum partners & Fincann is just the start to their goals of more mergers and acquisitions. With all the connections LB has in the cannabis & banking world, he has chosen to align his company with the ties to all the banks that do business with cannabis companies. If you’ve been to a dispensary, chances are you paid cash. They have a system for all these delivery and dispensary companies that allow debit cards now for a comparable fee. LB helped write the cannabis/ banking compliance laws in Nevada when they were still only medical and eventually upgraded to recreational. He knows that financials need to be audited to uplist from pink to otcqb along with other requirements. This is eventually needed for nasdaq as well though we are pretty far off from that with the pps. More eyes & brokers will have access to buying this stock once the stop sign goes down and it goes from current pink to otcqb (pps only needs to be .01 for otcqb with audited financials (check & check)). Look at your favorite otc tickers and see if they report financials as audited or unaudited. Most of the pink sheets will say unaudited. The plan is coming together and it’s taking a long time because he comes from a banking background and is super compliant with the SEC. it’s been stop sign since he took over last may but showed good faith when he released 2019 financials in October. It’s already been confirmed that 2020 financials are being audited. It’s just a matter of time now before they are released. That’s when you see the true plans and will realize that this is truly undervalued at the moment. I’ve been down over 50% before and just kept buying on dips. I have seen it go over 1000% as recently as today before the big dip, but I’m not selling for pennies. This has half the outstanding shares as tsnp.
