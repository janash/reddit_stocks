0,CHWY," Just want to point out a couple things that I think a lot of people are missing out on in the whole conversation, that I posted in another thread downplaying the situation. To many jumping on, it might be a meme but there are true merits here and honestly, I wished I caught on sooner.

&#x200B;

* The catalyst behind this was Ryan Cohen and two former CHWY execs joining the board. If they pivot into E-commerce (which grew 300%), their trading multiple would change too from dead business to ecomm.
* What would a new company be valued at with $6b revenue/y, growing ecomm by 300%, proven board and massive brand recognition (that just expanded X times in the last 2 weeks)? $500m? That's what the shorts think.
* The shut down Thursday might have stopped a massive squeeze, whether it being planned or not beforehand. The stock was soaring to $500 and was about to hit every strike as ITM. As we saw from the last Friday, these top end Calls might not have been covered yet. That shut down absolutely wrecked those strikes and premiums, as did disabling 0DTE buying on many platforms Friday.
* Their cap and price was what it was due to Shorts obliterating them. Their revenue was almost 10x their cap. Their fundamentals were so beyond warped noone got a full picture of what it was.

To add, a lot of FUD being posted lately so everyone do your own DD. Invest in risk based on what you can lose.

2,GME," > The consequence of this is that a lot of people are getting informed  

There is a TON of misinformation out there. It's like any other topic, people believe whatever confirms their bias. And yes, a couple of hedge funds are getting beat, but there is no scenario where retail investors don't end up holding the bag.  

Nobody is buying GME at these prices to invest. They are buying to screw a hedge fund (that may or may not still be in the stock) because it makes them feel good and powerful. It's moments like these that remind me why I have rule #1: Don't get emotional about stocks. When I see that rule clearly being broken by others I know there is money to be made, and it's not Wall Street I'll be making that money off of.",Kurso,26,/r/stocks/comments/l98jee/gme_end_financial_culture_how_this_meme_is/glhp4f6/,0.087,0.793,0.12,0.7835
3,DOW," So I am all aboard the gain train (30@$110avg) and making stacks off the ridiculous short situation seems good in theory, but I cant help but feel these evil billionaires always win and we are being played. Hopefully someone can prove me wrong, but a few thoughts I have had regarding the potential squeeze situation:

1. Coinciding with the whole RobinHood bullshit, the price went all the way up to $498, then back down to mid $100s in less than three minutes. During that period shorts also went up to \~240%, effectively doubling the previous %. So they drive the price up to almost $500, open new shorts, drive price back down to $100s, then close on their original shorts at a loss, but not a death blow, buying themselves some time in the process. Meanwhile, opening new shorts (that do not expire) at that high of a price ($490s - highest its ever been) will allow them to ride this out until the stock returns to HELLA low, pre-reddit frenzy prices, then cover those shorts and make BILLIONS. They can afford to ride it out long term on the non-expiring shorts because, while they will lose millions a day in interest on their borrowed shorts, the potential gains on the new $498 (and potentially higher this week) shorts they opened will FAR outweigh the interest they will have to pay waiting for the price to drop to cover super cheap months down the line from now.
2. Another potential theory is that every day the price has gone up, the rest of the NASDAQ and DOW/entire market has been down a fair amount. So that could mean they are selling their long positions to raise capital to cover their current shorts (also getting a 2.5bil loan from Daddy Citadel) all while doubling down on the shorts at 498 and making more billions in the process.

Even if they just drive the price down from $350-300/share with millions of shorts out (via short ladders, etc), thats a massive difference that could hold off interest and buy them time. They would be buying time to wait out all of WSB and amateur investors that have less knowledge, resources, and tools than they do. They have wayyyy deeper pockets than we do, so they can afford to wait for this to die off, go back to pre-frenzy prices, then cash out on their new shorts. And I am well aware of everyone with diamond hands, but lets be real. It comes down to a rigged game of HF billionaires that NEVER lose to normal people holding on longer than a bunch of redditors who have thrown a large portion of life savings into the stock. All they have to do is wait for them to get bored or cold feet and cash in, driving price back down, and getting a massive bag on their shorts. Even if the shares go up to $800-1k and beyond, they will continue to short at the highest prices because its insanely overvalued and will go back down in time. And when we keep buying at higher and higher prices thinking its going to the moon regardless, who do you think is selling them to you??? Paper hand people and HF opening new shorts!

The potential revenue of shorting at new highs waiting for the inevitable loss of people's interest/cashing in far outweighs interest costs accruing now. They're in it for the long haul, and I cant help but think we are not.

**TL;DR** \- All HF/Melvin have to do is manage to make enough money elsewhere (selling longs, opening new shorts, getting help from Citron, etc) to cover short interest and wait out amateurs who will inevitably sell.

I came up with these simplified possibilities while sitting on my balcony getting high and drinking whiskey, so what makes you think these fat dickskins at the top who have been cheating the system their whole lives haven't thought of it yet (assuming I'm not missing something here)?? That being said, I am intoxicated, my brain is smooth as an egg, and my Wheaten Terrier is transcribing this for me, so this is not financial advise in any way.",ToothierTadpole,5,/r/stocks/comments/l98jee/gme_end_financial_culture_how_this_meme_is/gli49km/,0.086,0.813,0.101,0.8625
4,ALL," Alot of people got redpilled on how the stock market is built for the rich this last week. Also how the mainstream media will cover for them by attacking the poor people with whatever propaganda they can think up (note, it is always the same ""isms"") and how the brokers themselves will totally fuck over the 99% at the drop of a hat. Like we already knew this, but I saw sports shows and comedians talking about the fucking stock market last week, EVERYONE knows it now. 

Maybe now people will fucking wake up to fact that literally ALL OF 2020 was about the transfer of the wealth from the poor to the rich, and everything else was an agenda manufactured by the media/politics to distract you from that exact fact. I don't know how many more data points someone needs to see this.

Its only gonna reinforce stupid financial myths like its a casino and you will lose all your money and its rigged. Especially when they find out they were giving all their money straight to wallstreet during this meme run.

People that had spent years learning a professional whatever and decades of experience thought they were going to out trade the sharks at Goldman and friends? Dudes walked in with 500k accounts and left with pennies. 
My buddy would only trade 3 or 4 times a week and outperformed the people trading 100x /hour (that's where the house makes coin).

I am also fairly ure that some of the smaller brokers simply couldnt handle the sheer volume of traffic.   
startups and small FinTech companies vut corners wherever they can to make their numbers look as sleek and great as possible.  


when trade gateways are not working, its probably not because they do not want it to work, its because they didn´t scale it right and were simply unprepared for anything like this.   
be it liquidity levels and collateral, be it IT Infrastructure.

During the 2 hours, TD completey shutdown the software for 'repairs'. I had theorized they disabled historical orders to prevent individuals with stop loses to cancel/ change orders. This then flushes them out during the short ladder. Likewise if the squeeze sqoze, we would  not be able to react. 

Right after we neared the bottom of the short ladder, I finally had full software functionality again.  So I bought 20 shares at 140.

I was so upset.

1) Who makes executive decisions for DTCC? And that level of intervention HAS to have some kind of govt hand in it 

2) is this basically implying they implemented 100% collateral as a way to force the brokers to close, knowing this block-out of retailers would happen, bc they determined the risk factor of the shorts liquidating was supposedly much greater than if the retailers made the squeeze happen?

3) if that is the case (whether the reasoning is truly to mitigate risk or actually to subtly side with the HFs) then how is it that they were able to pay for the Lehman bros debacle by paying out 500 billion? That was market wide melt down, this would have at worst been just Robinhood's clearing subsidiary (or w/e their relationship is)

4) lehman is still around as a pay-out shell, which still owes a debt, and here we are 12 years later with the strongest market in history, recovering and surpassing the covid crash, which means they know they can afford even worst case scenario (of course they wouldnt want it to happen) but it doesnt seem like this would have been HAD they not made collateral 100%. So this feels like a false-savior situation (as in ""look what I prevented"" but we dont know if this nuke situation would have actually happened) 

5) every day, even RH, trillions are exchanged back and forth, even on a slow day, but these 5 or 6 small-mid caps would have brought them down?

6) i understand a ripple effect was possible like 2008, but liquidation still has to exist somewhere. Although Im basing this on the Big Short's depiction of Michael Burry, the scene where he's buying the contracts at Goldman, he was asking about ""in the case of liquidity issues"" that they would be able to guarantee payment.

7) there will always be an obligation of payment, whether it be hundreds of billions to a few firms/parties or to a million people. A contract is a contract and every share is a contract

Which means they have the money to pay out either us or the HFs and SOMEBODY somewhere who triggered this snowball avalanche of market lockdown decided to do it to choose the shorts over the retailers.

So even if the ""market crashed"" people would have to be paid, period. They are prepared for that outcome, obviously since 2008 society didnt collapse.

79,RH," Thank you - I just came here to post this.

I was pissed at Webull but then became aware of this issue.

Boycotting the smaller brokerages would be counter-productive. They had to shut down because they weren’t as big as the other brokerages....

81,ALL," Ok here is the reason that I do not care:

When this shitshow triggered, and the price started tanking, ALL trading of the stock should have stopped.

In an instant, 30-50 %of the floating share shareholders could not buy, only sell the shares. I do not care if the reason was valid or not, that's the moment that the DTCC, or the SEC should have said: stop the stocks. Not the entire market, just those stocks. Buying And selling, not just retail, everyone.

Its all very fucking convenient to throw your hands up in the air and say ""oops"" while retail investors lose billions. And it still went on on Friday.

I don't care that many parties were involved, none of em did jack shit. DTCC should have halted trading in the stock when the coverage firms did not have the assets.

83,CEO," This. The issue should have been solved by disallowing margin, including uncleared deposits. If your clients can only buy shares with cleared cash funds, you should have no problem executing unlimited trades.

This was negligence and dishonest PR *at the very best*. The more likely scenario is that there were hands behind the scene helping guide them to the decision.

Couple different things that bug me about everything:

- First and foremost, Thomas Peterffy. He is the CEO of IBKR and was responsible for *most* of the non-Robinhood related outages. He said on a recorded interview with Bloomberg TV that his decision was in no way to protect his own company, nor was his company in any risk of not meeting liquidity/collateral requirements. He explained that he made the decision for the sole purpose of slowing down momentum in these stocks. **That is an admission of price manipulation**. You can take all the blocks of text you want, but the person that made the decision flat out said why he did it in [this interview](https://youtu.be/kV_P8wnY854) and for some reason nobody is talking about it.

- Second, Robinhood/Citadel/Melvin Capital. Melvin Capital had massive short positions in several of the ""meme stocks"". They were over-leveraged and un-hedged in unlimited risk positions, and the market found out and took advantage. Melvin Capital was literally going bankrupt. Now, Citadel has no financial stake in Melvin Capital. But they extended a $2 billion dollar loan (important for two reasons) to keep Melvin afloat. But back to Citadel. They *do have* a vested financial interest in Robinhood, because they own a substantial amount of equity in them. They also make a ton of profit off of the retail order flow they purchase from Robinhood. There are *a lot* of financial reasons Citadel would want to keep Robinhood successful. What we now know is that *the only reason Robinhood had to restrict trading was lack of capital*. Didn't Citadel extend $2B the day before to a friend they had no vested interest in? So the common sense thing is that they would extend whatever capital it takes to keep Robinhood solvent. Protect their actual investment, and future order flow supply. But they let it happen (and I think facilitated it happening). They let Robinhood completely implode their future when all they would've had to do was extend a short term capital loan, knowing the equity they had would end up worthless when Robinhood ceases to exist after this.

- Third, let's focus more on Robinhood. Prior to Friday, Robinhood was able to raise $1B in investment capital and a $500M loan. So they raised $1.5billion they did not have available the prior day. However, they effectively had the same restrictions in place at market open Friday - with the share limits that also factored stock you already owned and had cleared the 2 day waiting period, nobody could buy shares. Not only that, but the list of stocks kept growing and growing. After raising $1.5billion, they enforced *more restrictions* than the previous day. They also pre-liquidated positions at random times throughout the day. Many accounts, mine included, had positions liquidated at the absolute low of the day ($256-$260 range around 2:20pm). If it was a liquidity issue, why were there even more restrictions after raising $1.5B cash?

- Fourth, let's go back to the $2B loan to Melvin Capital. Ignore the lack of any vested interest in Melvin Capital prior to the loan. In order to loan $2B to a company, you need to have some reasonable expectation you will be paid back. As of the time the loan was provided, *there is not a reasonable person on Earth that would have expected Melvin Capital to be able to pay that back*. The squeeze hadn't even started yet, and Melvin was still stuck in their short positions. **The only saving grace for Melvin Capital at this point would have been some sort of divine intervention.** And what do you know? The next day, the overwhelming majority of the investors that are putting the pressure on this short squeeze got kicked out of the game for two days.

I fully understand the mechanics behind the reason we are being told that the buy-side of trading for hand-picked stocks was restricted. I don't believe that's the real reason. Especially because one of the biggest players that directly made this decision for many platforms flat out said the reason was to stop the squeeze. Lastly, if this was a legitimate issue, trading for the stocks should have been frozen. There should never be a scenario that one side of the deal is restricted. You're artificially creating one way price movement, and that's stock price manipulation. There is no way around that. The specific action taken manipulated the stock price, and it was very obvious what that action was going to do.",UnexpectedPeriod,21,/r/stocks/comments/l90an8/an_explanation_of_what_caused_the_trading_halt/glgub1h/,0.083,0.831,0.085,0.1703

With normal \~2% collateral requirements, they just kind of skated by but when it shot up to 100% they just had no funds to do it.

RH couldn't do anything other than stop buying.

However I do know that covering ALL short at 140% short interest would mean sale of 1.4 * market cap of the stock (currently 17.3 Billion). So a collateral of around 25 billion. Yikes. But doable, banks can get these special ultra short term loans to cover it. They can also cover their downside by buying calls on the stocks(the profit of the calls will cancel out the losses of the short). Lots of different ways they can go about it, but overall, i doubt it’ll cause a squeeze any different than a normal squeeze would under normal circumstances.

158,ALL," Excellent post. Wanted to adress few more concerns that people had.

First of all, I want to start by saying that some hedge funds are shady fucks. There are a lot of things they did illegal. Here are a few examples:

[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp)

Now I want to address some of the misconceptions that new traders have about the markets.

1. **I was not allowed to buy shares on RH they wanted to drive the price down!?**

DTCC, the clearinghouse for WeBull, RHand other brokerages, recently raised the collateral requirements for GameStop transactions to nearly 100%.

When RH takes a buy order it goes to it's clearinghouse to exchange it's clients money for shares. The shares are immediately and conveniently transferred to the client, but the funds aren’t transferred for 2 days. There's this gap between the broker and the clearinghouse for these unsettled trades that the clearinghouse will require some cash upfront (margin) for but otherwise accepts exposure for the rest.

If the stock being bought is extremely volatile, expensive and has a huge amount of recent volume and therefore unsettled trades, the clearinghouse will eventually realize they are floating quite a lot more to the broker than they are comfortable with on the back of a very risky equity. GME fits all these characteristics. It's this point in the GME scenario where DTCC sets margin requirements to 100%. They tell their brokers, ""Hey if you want to get GME stock from us, we will not accept your word that this trade will settle in two days. Instead we need the money upfront since we are already way too exposed to this one ticker from you.""

Now, if RH wants to continue filling buy orders for it's clients it needs to come up with ALL the money for each trade. RH does not have nearly enough cash on hand to handle this, hence the recent draw down from of RH's credit lines as they try to get enough liquidity to keep buying shares for their clients. Eventually the brokers just don't have enough cash, throw in the towel and stop accepting buy orders until they can settle more trades or the clearinghouses release the margin requirements for these stocks.

The concept that RH would fuck over basically their entire user base on purpose to help a minority investor's minority investment in a hedge fund that already closed their fucking short position doesn't stand up to even the smallest amount of scrutiny. It's just a boring case of the market plumping going wild because it's not built to handle pumps of this scale.

**2. But I was allowed to sell!**

Of course you were. Selling is exiting an already created position. The liability that RH would get if you were not able to sell and the price went down would be insane. They can not stop you from selling an asset that you own. They can, however, block the purchasing of new assets through their platform.

**3. But Fidelity and ThinkorSwim allowed people to buy and sell.**

Thinkorswim and Fidelity own their own clearing houses and have enough shares to satisfy the orders. Also, they do not need to pay collateral since they are a clearing house.

**4. Okay, but what about the 120% short interest, Melvin will be closing their position soon, and a short squeeze will happen.**

Melvin already closed their position. There was enough volume for them to do so.

The short interest are just estimations. Short interest information gets released on 15th and 30th of each month. Next week we will be able to see the short positions.

Hedge funds keep taking short positions and are much better prepared for now, because there is more money to be made on riding a stock down to 40 from 400, then from 5 to 1.

Many hedge funds are also riding the wave up, and have long positions in GME. Blackrock, one of the biggest money managers already made insane profit, and will probably ride this on a way down.

**5. But a short squeeze will happen!**

It could, or it could not. The interest in not high to a point were they will go bankrupt or have to buy back the shares to cover. They can comfortably hold for 6-12 month as long as they don’t get margin called, which I don’t expect them too, tbh. The payoff makes sense, think about it this way. The interest is I think 30% yearly. Let’s say you short a billion dollars worth GME. You pay annual interest of 30-40%. Hedge funds definitely have enough money to pay that 300 million a year. Now, let’s say in a year a price goes down from 400 to 40. A fund will make essentially 900 million dollars minus the interest fee and etc. it is a no brainer for some bigger funds to take this position and enjoy their easy 40% profit.

Considering many funds have insane amounts of collateral, they will not get margin called from this.

**6. But if options expire in the money they have to sell their shares!**

A lot of options expired ITM on Friday, so why did the price not go up?

Well, how many retail investors that were holding their options actually had enough money to buy 100 shares at a strike price? Not too many.

**7. Okay, but Hedge funds are still bad and evil!**

Sure, I agree. Some are. Some hedge funds get their funding from managing pensions and endowments funds.

**8. But Citadel was manipulating the markets!**

Citadel and Citadel securities are two separate LLCs. They are only allowed to open long positions, they can not short a stock. One is a market maker that processes option orders and has no say in the markets. In fact, the more volume there is, the more money they make on the spreads. Would jot be surprised if Citadel made a lot of money on market making in the past week.

**9. But Hedge funds are insane investors with 50% annual return.**

Not necessarily true, an average hedge fund has been underperforming for the past 20 years. You probably had better returns then them just by investing in index funds. Don't get me wrong, a lot of smart people work in the funds, but their main goal is to hedge, in other words, be safe from market movements in any direction.

**TL;DR**

Hedge funds are bad, but they are not retarded (except for Melvin, who overextends on a short at $5)

But many of the rules that came in play were written decades ago, they were not take from thin air. Because against hedge funds is good, but throwing different theories that will be easily disapproved once they file 13F will not take them down.

Brokers are margin-calling other hedge funds, hence they stopped trading so they can mitigate their risks, which sucks for retail investors.

IMO there a few scenarios that can play out.
 1. Melvin just holds their positions long enough for the price to come down a bit. People forget and move on. 
2. Melvin works out deals with their lenders to pay the fmv for the shares they owe(this way it doesn’t drive the price up in the open market) and everyone is left bag holding. 
3. People do hold, there continues to be gamma/ short squeezes, gme skyrockets more, many billions are lost by the banks that push for some new regulations on shorting.

231,GME," Well, simplified, the steps of a short:

1.  Borrow shares (now you're paying interest on those until they're returned)
2.  Sell shares on open market

4.  Buy stock stock back (you get to keep... or pay whatever the price differential was between the sale and purchase)
5.  Return to the person the lender

I believe what /u/Taystats33 is saying is this... we're at step 3... what if the hedge funds call up the folks that lent them the shares to short and say ""Hey, so... uh... this is awkward but why don't we just pay you whatever GME is at right now (or work out a price) and pretend like this never happened and we don't need to buy the shares back?  Pretty please?""  This effectively eliminates step 4 and 5.  What happens then, is that the folks who bought on the idea that there will be a short squeeze now hold an asset with a radically different paradigm.  The lenders get money for the shares they had, the hedgie bois are out a buttload of money (but not as much if they had to buy shares back and run the price up), and the people who bought the stock now hold something without the value they thought it had... and there's a selling race to the bottom.",Tacticool_Turtle,6,/r/stocks/comments/l8yp14/in_case_of_a_fullblown_squeeze_on_gme_who_would/glftdqv/,0.04,0.828,0.132,0.9714

262,GS," Exactly. 

All these ""💎 ✋"" people WILL sell. You can guarantee it, it's only a matter of time.

I was on the fence all week and the more I read about it and listen to economic podcasts and interviews (both for and against it) the more I realize how this is going to make a lot of regular folks lose out on a lot of money.

I personally have ample savings to be plenty comfortable and I have sound investments so if I gamble a couple of grand on this craziness so be it. **It would literally just to experiment with an absurdly risky stock, which is totally NOT my thing under normal circumstances.**

If I get on the bandwagon you bet your @$$ I'm gonna sell when it best suits me to sell. Holding onto a risky stock in solidarity or whatever is just a bad idea. Everyone will bail out eventually.

I get why they're currently holding to drive up the price for shorts but what I don't understand is how so many of them are thinking that by simply holding onto a stock indefinitely will make them rich or something.

You only make $ when you sell and in order to sell you need someone willing to buy. So you're either the guy able to cash out at it's peak *(or until you've had enough and need cash to pay your rent)* or you're the sucker that's getting in way too late overpaying for the overly inflated stock and you catch a ride on the elevator back down to reality.

I've read somewhere that GS might transform their company and go in a new direction. In which case there's possible opportunity worthy of investment. But there's so much hearsay it's hard to know what's what. GS is still in financial difficulty. And I'm not quite sure what's keeping them from simply issuing more shares for the wall street to buy at the high price? I'm no expert on shorts by **any** means, they're far too wild for me to have ever given them a place in my portfolio, but wouldn't that move alone crash the entire GS movement? 

The current price of these shares are not rooted in any type of business reality, they're 100% artificially inflated to these astronomical heights. It's called a bubble for a reason.

It's bothersome that interacting on WSB there's so many people (many of which are new reddit accounts) that legit think they're going to get rich. They're looking to other strangers on the internet to give them financial advice knowing damn well they have no idea what their actual motives are.

I took any ""advice/not advice"" with a grain of salt. A few people have a solid understanding of what's going on and I appreciated how they articulated their views and explanations. They answered my questions with facts and seem to be in the realistic understanding that this is temporary and to be smart about it. But the overwhelming majority of people though are just regurgitating emojis and what other people say. They're clueless as to how markets work and their driving force behind this gamble is simply FOMO.

That's a dangerous combination and anyone who doesn't see that reality is living in dreamland.",PantyPixie,6,/r/stocks/comments/l9ho6u/tired_of_the_meme_stocks/glifcpe/,0.077,0.837,0.085,0.7601

We have truth and real reporting happening before our eyes. Yes its going to get rocket for others I’m sure, and it seems unfair now but it will settle and be positive in the long run.
Just let your trades sit for a month, go do something else and let these people try and positively reform the manipulated market that that you partake in, so it benefits all of us.

The earlier funds will likely need to liquidate. 20% is owned by sompo a strategic Japanese insurance company which is creating a JV in Japan.  


Out of the cap table about 20% is held by VCs which need to liquidate due to fund life terms. The 60% that is owned by Thiel, Karl and Sompo is not going to be sold.

Gmstp, other than the 140% short interest, had a real catalyst. Part of what I wrote in a couple threads:

* The catalyst behind this was Ryan Cohen and two former CHWY execs joining the board. If they pivot into E-commerce (which grew 300%), their trading multiple would change too from dead business to ecomm.
* What would a new company be valued at with $6b revenue/y, growing ecomm by 300%, proven board and massive brand recognition (that just expanded X times in the last 2 weeks)? $500m? That's what the shorts think.

People started investing over a year ago based on a value play. What happened recently was a perfect storm of short interest, new board members and poking the hornets nest that is the internet.

The other, on the other hand, has nothing much going for it other than staving off bankruptcy for 5 months with loan. The movie theater industry was in a down spiral for years. COVID didn't help, but it wasn't the cause. When many thought they would pivot into a new business model for the past year while the stock kept jumping and dipping, they didn't.

What's your background in investing? How've you gained this knowledge?

322,EVER," We start with 1 share of G.

Bob holds 1 share of G. Sally want to short G, bob lends it to sally to short, and she sells it to John. Sally is now short 1 share and John *and bob* are both long 1 share each. Ann wants short G. so she reaches out to John. John lends Ann the share, and she sells it short to Phil. 

So: 

Bob is long 1 share
Sally is short 1 share
John is long 1 share 
Ann is short 1 share
Phil is long 1 share. 

Now keep in mind, we started this with ONE share of G stock. Here’s the trick: the share count for G, by definition, only counts the number of shares that G has issued. Bob’s share of G is ‘of record’ (meaning official), but John’s and Phil’s share is lent on margin (not an official share) and dont count as part of the share count. 

So in this case, we have 1 ‘official’ share being lent multiple times, creating 2 short positions. If we calculated the float here, we could say (completely honestly) “G is 200% short” bc (2 short positions)/(1 official share) = 200% short. 

Where people get confused is that the act of shorting creates *another* shadow/margin share that must be settled.

NO HEDGE FUND HAS TO BUY IN THEIR SHORTS EVER. WSB has no fucking clue what’s going on in reality. 

The short interest right now is either 1) options dealers hedging the *insane* number of puts outstanding (and/or any synthetic positions out), and 2) it is *trivial* for a sophisticated hedge fund to have a short position in a stock and be net long (profiting when it goes up). In fact, the few funds playing this right now are doing precisely that.

I am wondering how all of this is gonna play out.

I am not the most experienced person but I know a little bit because I have myself taken care of my personal investments between me and my husband's personal and mutual accounts even if I have them professionallymanaged for now (IRA, 401k etc....) and learned along the way but even with an MBA my remainder knowledge of finance class isn't enough for me to justify some behaviors I read on there.

I don’t enjoy watching others make personal attack against those with conflicting views.  For example someone giving an opinion on Tesla being overvalued and another redditor just saying “then short it,” “buy puts”, “another salty idiot who missed out.”

Confirmation bias has been strong in all of the Reddit’s for a while and has really hurt the overall DD, research and opinion of those that have more experience or just want to provide their opinion.

I am also not a fan of seeing multiple threads asking the same question, “is it too late to invest,” “got 1k and want to invest, tell me what I should invest in.”

I value anyone’s opinion, and have made plenty mistakes in the market.

I hope the new mods can help condense the threads to where new comers can ask in one thread instead of there being a 100 threads on the same subject. I think there should be a thread for new people invested to ask questions and not be shamed as it is all a learning experience.

I also believe that there should be a headline that informs people that just because the DD or opinion sounds great it doesn’t mean you will see gains or to panic if the investment doesn’t work out short term.

424,DD," >Mate, walking into traffic is a ridiculous comparison, but it did give me a chuckle.

This reply to what I said is called an appeal to the stone.

Firstly, it's not a comparison I made, it's an analogy, and quite a simple one at that.

One side of the road = Present position.
Pot of gold on the other = Profit.
Road = Market.
Car = Any decision-influencing market or company info.

Looking for traffic = Speculative market research/DD to inform action relative to chance of safely getting to profit.

Not looking = Gambling in the market. Might succeed in getting to profit but equally, financial situation might be made worse by something that could easily have been avoided had one only looked.

Yes, 'speculation' isn't a life or death event. But that's because it isn't even an event of any sort, it's a mental activity. Saying speculation isn't a life or death event is as absurd as suggesting mental arithmatic will kill you. 

I'm not going to try and convince you further, because you are clearly willing to die upon this hill in spite of anything I say.

But if quoting Buffet is supposed to be some kind of gotcha, you're misunderstanding what he's saying in that quote. His argument is that the stock market attracts a gambling mindset because of the possibility of 'winning', but that gambling in the market ultimately leads to losing. 'Day if reckoning'.

But the fact of the matter is: Citadel paid Janet Yallen. Janet Yallen has a key role in the US gouv. Citadel pays RH for order flow. Citadel bailed out Melvin Capital. Melvin Capital shorted G. Citadel was fined multiple times for misleading retail investors. Short squeeze didn't happen because buying pressure was suppressed, very good opportunity for HFs who weren't under the ban to reposition themselves.

468,BIG," Sorry it's a really old post 4 months ago or so... And in a sub that big it's basically lost... 

I can tell you when I started investing I thought of doing the exact same thing as the guy on WSB. There is a reason lots of people look up biggest stock losers every day on Google... While I would hesitate to pick the bottom 10 and buy calls for all of them I would look at each one and find 2-3 I feel don't deserve that stock price dropoff at that rate... 


One good example of this strategy working is when some Kid died at a Disney park years ago and the stock price went down for a day pretty sharply because of it. Some smart investors bought OTM calls that expired literally the day after and were rewarded BIG TIME. Then again public outcry could of carried over into a second day so maybe just lucky??? 


After studying psychology in university and learning that the top 200 strategy's are all outperformed by a money throwing darts at a wall (stocks only go up-WSB) it's safe to say that as a strategy rises in popularity the market corrects for this and it becomes less profitable.

475,GME," Risk is one of the parties not having enough money in their accounts to cover an unpaid trade. So for example I am a new trader with some shares in my account but I am using margin to yolo with everyone else on robinhood or whatever brokerage they are on. Before they clamped restrictions me and 100000 buddies used our margin and bought GME on margin but not at the bottom but all the way up. Now if I default, not a big deal because I only could afford a little bit, I can just walk away but there isn't just me. Hence the risk of mass default on a correction constitutes massive risk. Clearing houses have to clear out to both parties daily and the brokerages usually have a couple day hold to ensure everything settles right. The delay adds another layer to the risk which is why the brokerages have to put large cash deposits into the houses to cover that risk. When done normally trades in and out basically are broad based and offset the risk but when it is mostly trades in a bankrupt company at 100x value that risk poses a present danger. Especially when averaged over all of the people yoloing with other peoples money. Once it has begun it no longer matters if it is on margin or not as the genie is out of the bottle so to speak. Hopefully that makes sense. Tuesday's trades on GME alone were 26B, Brokerages houses don't have that kind of cash to put up for collateral. On Friday that value was still 16B just for GME. To stay SEC compliant they have to post enough cash to cover the trades until they are cleared. When they can't they have to adjust the ability to trade the risky symbols. Hope all that makes sense.

477,PCG," Like the value aspect of PCG here, but saying Palantir will magically spin them around is ""hopium"".

Disclosure: currently long Palantir for the long haul.

Palantir is a great solution, but only if the data it gets is quality. The TL;DR for the stock is that it automates what a Data Analyst would report after working through a large set of data. That is the hope go forward, great Data Analysts are hard to come by and expensive, so let's do it via software. Anyways, back to PCG.

PCG came out of bankruptcy with a TREMENDOUS amount of debt. Given they are a utility, I don't see any fast moves up in price action, but I can see your argument for value here. The debt is an albatross though, and it will take time. The fact that they are going to use Palantir is moot in the short term, but could pay nicely in the long term. The lack of faith I have is that Foundry will only be as good as the data it received. PCG has a managerial track record as bureaucratic, slow paced and political. The data may or not be good from the various databases they want to pull from, but can management actually get out of their own way to get the solution deployed and creat value? We'll see. 

Best of luck on your play, but don't get married to this because of Palantir. They have a great solution, but many companies buy great solutions and it becomes shelfware (never fully deployed and useless).

490,SI," Slow accumulation is the approach until you begin to see upward momentum. Short interest data is notoriously inaccurate so what you are seeing on paper doesn't tell the full story.

Shorts wouldn't be squeezed out until the upward momentum surpassed what they were able to tolerate. This usually requires a positive catalyst or institutional intrest on the long side of the trade.

You alone will not be able to do anything, even with a group of retail investors, unless you throw millions at it.

Furthermore look at their fundamentals and see why it was a target for shorts in the first place. There could be evidence that a firm saw fraudulent information and is forcing them down as a result, or that it is just a really bad company in general.

Finally, there is very little chance that this will be the next big squeeze. If the SI is like you say they will likely see the momentum uptick and slowly unwind without driving it too high.

541,HTH," Are we discussing US taxes? If so:

1. You have long term capital gains (difference between buy and sell dates >= 1 year), and you have short term capital gains (< 1 year)
   1. long terms gains have a preferential lower tax rate
   2. short term gains have the same rate as you other income
   3. short term losses can reduce long term gains and vice versa
2. At the end of the calendar year, you will owe taxes on your net gains
3. If you have losses, you may use up to $3000 of those losses to reduce your other taxable earnings
4. Don't forget about estimate taxes!
   1. while taxes are computed and due in April of the following year, the government does not want to give anyone a free loan (on the other hand, they are very happy to borrow from you at no charge -- a tax refund is government repaying an interest free loan)
   2. if your other withholdings do not cover 100% (110% for higher incomes) of your prior year's taxes or your current year's tax liabilities you should pay quarterly estimated taxes to avoid a penalty
   3. example:
      1. your withholdings cover your earned income but you also made 30% of your income trading last year
      2. your withholdings this year will also cover \~80% of last year's tax liabilities and you again have been accumulating gains
      3. so, you should divide the remaining \~20% of projected tax liabilities into four quarterly estimated tax payments

It's all a bit more nuanced than that with a lot of special cases, especially once you breach certain income categories, but this should give you a rough outline.

File your own taxes with something like TurboTax to fully understand all the tax liability computations or hire someone competent to do this for you if you don't want to bother.

543,IRS," I may have worded it poorly but I think we are on the same page. The IRS doesn’t care how much I have into a stock. I.E if I have a $100 sitting in a stock, that means nothing to them until I change my position. So if I put $100 in, never touch it, come tax time I have nothing to report.

But if I own 2 stocks and the price doubles, so I sell one to get my original investment back it is a gain, therefore subject to tax. The IRS doesn’t care that I originally put X amount into the 2 stocks. They just care that I sold 1 stock at 100% gain. So if my intention is to get my original investment back, I need to sell higher to account for tax.

-So if I bought 2 stocks at $50 I’m $100 all in

-Stock goes to $100 a share

-I sell 1 at $100 to get my initial investment back

-But that is a 100% gain on that stock and therefore taxed so I need to sell a little higher to cover tax and give me $100 clean return.

Granted these are just “rough” numbers. I know that’s not mathematically correct. Like if I bought a stock at $50 and sold for $100, the gain is $50 not $100 so the $50 is what’s taxed.",Die-Ringer,1,/r/stocks/comments/l9g4h3/can_we_have_a_short_discussion_on_taxes_and_what/glib7s1/,0.011,0.793,0.195,0.9929

560,RH, remember its a two sided market so when it starts to plunge there wont be enough people buying a losing stock so the price is going to free fall. dont let greed make you lose your money. you can see whats already happening. I think a lot of people are going to get the 250k finra insurance payment and lose out on the rest because its blatanly obvious RH is having major liquidity issues. I wouldnt be surprised if they declare bankruptcy and reopen under a different name or somehow get the SEC to declare the earnings illegally obtained by market manipulation.

562,ABC," Good faith violation
What is it? A good faith violation occurs when you buy a security and sell it before paying for the initial purchase in full with settled funds. Only cash or the sales proceeds of fully paid for securities qualify as ""settled funds.""
Liquidating a position before it was ever paid for with settled funds is considered a ""good faith violation"" because no good faith effort was made to deposit additional cash into the account prior to settlement date. The following examples illustrate how 2 hypothetical traders (Marty and Trudy) might incur good faith violations:
Good faith violation example, Marty:
Cash available to trade = $0.00
On Monday morning, Marty sells XYZ stock and nets $10,000 in cash account proceeds
On Monday afternoon, he buys ABC stock for $10,000
If Marty sells ABC stock prior to Wednesday (the settlement date of the XYZ sale), the transaction would be deemed a good faith violation because ABC stock was sold before the account had sufficient funds to fully pay for the purchase.
Good faith violation example, Trudy:
Cash available to trade = $10,000, all of which is settled
On Monday morning, Trudy buys $10,000 of XYZ stock
On Monday mid-day, she sells XYZ stock for $10,500
At this point, Trudy has not incurred a good faith violation because she had sufficient settled funds to pay for the purchase of XYZ stock at the time of the purchase. However:
Near market close on Monday, Trudy buys $10,500 of ABC stock
On Tuesday afternoon, she sells ABC stock and incurs a good faith violation
This trade is a violation because Trudy sold ABC before Monday's sale of XYZ stock settled and those proceeds became available to pay for the purchase of ABC stock
Consequences: If you incur 3 good faith violations in a 12-month period in a cash account, your brokerage firm will restrict your account. This means you will only be able to buy securities if you have sufficient settled cash in the account prior to placing a trade. This restriction will be effective for 90 calendar days.",ZDSilver95,4,/r/stocks/comments/l9i6fp/good_faith_violation/gli4rp9/,0.116,0.705,0.178,0.9737
563,TDA," I have a TDA account, and the tutorial video on their side explaining how to transfer in cash explicitly states that selling a stock that was bought with cash that is still uncleared (from a deposit) does not constitute a good faith violation, unlike using unsettled cash from selling stock.
