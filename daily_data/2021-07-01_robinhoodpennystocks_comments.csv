The only reason why anyone should be on this subreddit is for potential DD and to convince users to leave Robinhood.

14,CTXR," Dang. I shoulda dug deeper into CTXR. Didn't realize it was flying or crashing on the announcement of a halt. This is a good lesson to me to not let another stock affect your expectations for a completely unrelated one. 

I was astounded by TRCH's run up and thus thought CTXR was a shoe in $5 and I could take profit there but then it peaked and just dipped since and I got numb to the gradual dipping til crap finally hit the fan. If I had understood the run up better, I would definitely taken proftis over $4 but I got a bit greedy. 

Big shame. Thankfully I didn't average up on this so I was still able to lock in profit today albiet a good bit less than what I could have. I think long term it'll get a good bit higher than this but I am not sure what can make bounce back up or even hold its current levels right now and I don't want to risk holding my full position through another small cap correction which it might not tank well. 

Sucks but good notes to be taken. It's what I get for not being as well informed of other people's intentions as I was with TRCH (which I was able to play quite well and thank goodness too. Taken Ls on both these tickers woulda been devestating for my morale). Will see what it does from here to the end of the year start trying to what would be a good move ticker to enter. CTXR has definitely reminded me how important it is to not only understand the company but people's intentions too.",OKJMaster44,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ob9t5q/daily_discussion_thread/h3pxboz/,0.077,0.73,0.194,0.9894

19,DD," There's a difference between listening to what someone says, and taking it at face value. I generally don't rely random people on the internet regardless of account age, karma etc. I've gotten to know a handful of traders online quite well and trust them, but still do my own DD in case I turn up something they didn't. Best use of fintwit message boards etc. is to discover ideas and put your own out there to be tested. But they're not my points of reference; I verify from source material.",stompingllama,5,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/obsbq6/whats_up_with_comments_in_this_subreddit_being/h3psclb/,0.05,0.888,0.062,-0.22
