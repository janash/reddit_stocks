12,RC," In my mind it is. Well positioned in North america, insane brand value after all this news, no debts + RC and his INSANELY high level team of chewy and amazon execs. 

All of that, at a 10b valuation in the gaming industry which is valued at 300b+ rn alone and growing super quickly.


EDIT: I cant find my precious source, most websites have it between 150-200B as of now, but the growth rate is very high 


here is a piece on wikipedia valueing it at 230B in 2022 


The United States has the largest video games presence in the world in terms of total industry employees.[82][86] In 2017, the U.S. game industry as a whole was worth US$18.4 billion and consisted of roughly 2457 companies that had a rough total of 220,000 people employed.[87][88] U.S. video game revenue is forecast to reach $230 billion by 2022,[89] making it the largest video game market in the world.[77] Over 150 million Americans play video games, with an average age of 35 and a gender breakdown of 59 percent male and 41 percent female.[90] American gamers are more likely to vote than non-gamers, feel that the economy is the most important political issue, and lean conservative, however party demographics are split evenly with 38% identifying as Democrats, 38% identifying as Republicans, and 24% identifying as Independents.[91]

13,AMC," This was always the play, at least in my mind. 

The stock is likely overshorted. It is theoretically worth infinity dollars. But that‚Äôs *speculative*. Speculative investing is...not the best. 

So what is true?

-	28 million Americans bought GME or AMC (or  other, but I think these two is safe assumption) that‚Äôs 28 million people who now have a reason for a preferred games retailer
-	GME had one of the most successful, cheapest ad campaigns in the history of humanity
-	No bad debt
-	New leadership - the one man who‚Äôs beaten Amazon at e-commerce

Even if the squeeze never squozes there is literally no way this can go tits up. There is now a captive market, they‚Äôre fixing the customer experience, *and they have brick and mortar already*. Amazon had to pay *billions* for brick and mortar (buying Whole Foods). GME *got paid* to transform itself. It‚Äôs so perfect.  Couple that with the fact that games are the perfect half digital/half physical product and it‚Äôs just so perfect. 

The biggest thing to me is the company ownership. GME has changed peoples lives forever. Brains are dumb and people will be indebted to GME for the rest of their lives. Get a dopamine hit (supporting company that changed you life) for shopping for a dopamine hit (moar games)? Sign me up! What an amazing company-customer feedback loop. 

People have said before - but I *definitely* spend more money on games than I do on my dogs. I suspect more people play games than own pets. The games market is orders of magnitude larger than the pet industry *and it‚Äôs still in its infancy*. Comparisons to Chewy‚Äôs market cap aren‚Äôt 100% applicable, but they‚Äôre not so outlandish.

17,GME," It's not a failing company, but anyone who genuinely believes this valuation is legitimate and that GME was just a diamond waiting to be found at sub-10 levels is just deluding themselves. It wouldn't have needed a short squeeze strategy to get up to these levels if that was true.

We'll see where it is in a year or so-- that'll be a bigger indicator of where it belongs than a few months of people massively pumping a stock up. It can only work for so long, no matter how much I wish opening a position in GME right now would be valid-- people are probably making killings on covered calls",TBWolf,11,/r/stocks/comments/n3uk2j/gamestop_completes_voluntary_early_redemption_of/gwsvlku/,0.08,0.804,0.116,0.3136
18,GME," I don‚Äôt see it that way.  Massive over-shorting of GME coiled up a spring in its stock price.  What was used to justify very high borrowing costs on the way down led to zero borrowing costs on the way back up.

This isn‚Äôt about their P/E ratio or valuation.  This is simply about a Wall Street financial engineering bomb blowing up and balancing itself out.  It‚Äôll probably go down again once all the froth dies down, but there‚Äôs also zero reason to massively short a stock with no long term debt...so it might be a while before that happens.",deadjawa,10,/r/stocks/comments/n3uk2j/gamestop_completes_voluntary_early_redemption_of/gwrybst/,0.051,0.949,0.0,-0.5994

34,AMC," The only thing that would make the shorting and the debt connected would be if the shorting had caused the share price to go below the price at which the debt could be converted. That actually happened with AMC. That wasn't happening here.

Here the company issued new shares, got new cash, and paid the debt with that cash. But the reason they had the debt was to have money to operate and to improve. Now they don't have the debt, and they don't have the money, and the stock is diluted, and it's massively overpriced, and it's not nearly as heavily shorted as it was before, and not by the same people.

The only way this works is if closing this debt allows them to take an even bigger debt, because it's pretty apparent that they're going to need way more cash than they have to complete the transformation that everybody thinks they're trying to accomplish.

43,CD," A major downfall of video games right now is digital content. With some stores, ps3 and whatnot closing down if you paid to download a game, then the service becomes obsolete and you lose your hardrive, you lose that game forever. 

The problem with any streaming service these days is that they continuously pull content and the content that is available is no good (opinion). I have honestly started buying physical dvds and blurays again second hand because they are cheap as fuck and you will always have it. There is so much content out there that you cant find digitally. Even illegal torrents are a pain now. Firstly they are illegal and you can get fined, second torrents are a shell of what they used to be and volume of content available is disappearing.

With video games now you are starting to see the downfall of digital content. You buy a game and its basically a demo until your first download then you can play the game. If you need to access the developer or systems stores in able to access your paid content what do you actually own? I live in a rural area and i quit playing warzone. Every couple days there was a 60gb download. My 10mb internet is slow as fuck for that. 

Same foes for apple music. Why should i pay for a digital album if i need to access thier service to utilize it, what do I own? Granted, now I use Spotify cause it is awesome but they rarely, if ever, pull music from thier service. And if they started to do that like what netflix does i would probably opt out. I still do buy vinyl and the odd CD if its a small band, or signed or special edition or whatever. I know guys that started buying cassettes again, which i would never do cause the quality is shit.

Multimedia being digitized is not the future. If you dont have it in your hands or saved and backed up in your memory storage then you are not in control of it.

Nobody actually understands how it works, theoretically inflation should be way higher in the developed world than it is right now. Before the pandemic as well.

Like if a grocery store have 100 coke cans for sale and 10 of it is sold to consumers, if the government suddenly buys 70 of it, it doesn't increase the price of the coke at all. In this analogy, right now the economy of America is like the Grocery Store where your ability to produce is no where near the limit in which the economy's maximum.

When Zimbabwe's currency isn't worth anything, no one cares. It doesn't effect anyone's bottom line. Companies will just stop doing business. They don't have a huge economy as leverage.

The fact that USA imports and exports so much volume can't be ignored. All other countries want to be in the American stock market, not as many people are interested in china's stock market or japan's stock market or Zimbabwe's stock market.

155,MMT," Assuming you're in the US or at least we're talking about it, with Fed being the example. 

Stimulus checks are actual helicopter money... it's up to the recipient to spend that money according to their personal needs. I am reading here you think this went to equity markets? -> how do you arrive at that conclusion for the majority of the 85% of population (allegedly) receiving the stimulus?

In any case, stimulus money is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg, as you said. 

It doesn't matter ""where"" inflation is btw. It's interesting and also prevalent with mainly MMT apostles to bend arguments. 

""Inflation is not important if it's inflating asset prices, deal with it!"" 

""Valuations are totally normal as we're in a different world and tech is so great that it can't be valued any lower, that's just the new normal valuation of high P/E due to high future income"".

Where as I'd argue that is one of the more dangerous alarm signals 

Usually economists ask (Amongst many other things)

""Does increased, levered liquidity inflate transactional prices in an elevated manner?""

If this comes on top of some other things like massive stimulus, exaggerated investments with leverage and some other bubble indicators, you'll get to

a) bubbles in certain markets (assets, stocks, ?)

b) creeping inflation that drives said bubbles (valuations), that might first infect certain areas of the economy and then become a wildfire as other areas realize the devaluation of money is going on.",BestGermanEver,1,/r/stocks/comments/n3p9c5/why_is_everyone_saying_theres_going_to_be/gwrb14b/,0.074,0.843,0.083,0.6651

I'm sure there are other parts of the USA that are hot spots for EV adoption. The specific utilities that serve those areas will be the first to see a huge bump in demand.

439,GEO," I disagree. Learning the financial side first than learn about competitive edge. A company can only grow so much. If a companies market cap is all priced in for the next 10 years, you best believe that stock is moving sideways. 

The mistake I made when I started investing was not taking into consideration this. For a young investor go for companies with low PE and high growth. If possible. Higher PE‚Äôs can work but then you have to understand the percentage of growth of the company, high PEs mean the growth has to be rapid. Low PEs are risk as well because it means the company is static like Intel or a scum stock like GEO, which looks attractive but is political mess. A high PE could also mean a company is just reinvesting it‚Äôs money, so the earnings aren‚Äôt reflecting. No PE means try using the price to sales rating, but that is not accurate, at least as accurate as one can hope. The numbers tell a story, the story is there to see. A cash flow calculation of the last five earnings works for a stable company but fast growing, you can take the last year if you believe it can maintain it.

444,TGT," That depends entirely on the company in question.

Let me tell ya I have been doing this for about 5 years now, and almost every time I got bored, said fuck it and sold, within a month or two the stock in question recovered and reached new highs.

I bought TGT at slightly above a $100 watched with horror as is dipped for several month on end, I sold it, and now a year later is at $211 

I refused to by Amazon when it was rising everyday to reach almost $3000, waiting for a dip, then finally I got it at a little below $3000, sat on it for a a couple of month not seeing any recovery or action, sold as soon as it crossed $3000, missing a potential $400 if I had waited. There was a conversation here recently where people was bashing Amazon and calling it a lost cause just before it goes up again, lol. 

Worst move, I was a believer in Tesla very early on, I held the bag forever when it was $300 pre split. Sold right before the earning report because it always dipped when they announced losses, that was the earning report where they had the surprise win, by next day the stock was  $400, I said I will just wait for it to come back, it went up to $1000, Eder up buying the same number of stocks I sold at $200 for close to a $1000 each.
