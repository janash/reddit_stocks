The SP500 will always focus on the US. So if in the Next 50 years some other country will be something like the US in terms of stocks you're pretty much fcked.

You can mitigate that issue by simply taking any ETF on the MSCI World. It contains lots of the US anyways because it's weighted by market cap. But if companies from outside the US get bigger they'll get included into the MSCI World but stay out of the SP500

33,AMD," >Intel goal at the moment is to gain enough GPU market share to beat Nvidia

Lol never got to happen.

Nvidia doesn't have 80% GPU market share because the hardware is so great, they are at 80% because Nvidia is super strong in the next state of the art technology only achievable with Nvidia cards and very strong support for developers also mostly only available with Nvidia cards. Developers then develope games and other products with Nvidia GPU of course therefore Nvidia cards also perform often far better even when an AMD card seems stronger from the values, games still vastly run better with Nvidia cards. Same goes on for basically all industries require graphics cards or graphical services.

I don't see neithe amd nor intel providing the same amount of tools and sources for graphical development and even then, nobody would double development cost including all tools, so most companies will stay with what the pipeline already uses unless intel or AMD provide VAST advancement over Nvidia which probably won't be the case within the next decade and especially intel has to recover from being kicked off the throne by AMD.

After a certain point it won't matter if there's a ban, because no one in their right mind would buy a brand new ICE vehicle, unless the automaker is selling it a steep loss.

Regarding BTU, it appears they didn't get the surety resolved before quarter end--IR had emailed several folks and said they wanted to get it done before March 31st or worst case first week of April. What this means now is that they can still make an announcement via 8K in this upcoming week (apparently they need to get 13 signatures physically signed), but they cannot start the actual buybacks until the earnings report is released end of April. There is a blackout period that starts April 1st. 

Some were hoping they would both announce the resolution and initiate buybacks before today, but it looks like that will have to wait. Patience will be key here.

It looks like BTU had large buying right before close today, likely in anticipation of big moves coming up. Quarter end selling might have also impacted today's price action at least early on (BTU is not an ESG name funds want to have on their portfolio). There will be selling pressure from Elliott Management looking to exit their position, but shareholder returns will likely bring in plenty of new buyers, including BTU itself, to bring stock price up. 

I'm roughly equally bullish on AMR/BTU, with the risk of BTU not executing on the capital returns making up for AMR having less upside.",AP9384629344432,2,/r/stocks/comments/127fv36/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_mar/jeg8ny0/,0.039,0.889,0.072,0.7704

But, they're also still raking in cash while their shares have dropped 80% from recent highs. Their EPS is 3.61 while their share price is like $9.50. Their P/B ratio is like 0.27. ok so they don't have a bright future, who cares? they don't have to be around long to earn back my investment, at least if they paid a dividend, which they don't.

199,PB," Firstly, PE and PB don't ""determine which stocks to buy"". At best they should be seen as metrics to better understand how other market participants are valuing a stock.

The way you might use PE and PB to help determine which stock to buy would be to compare your valuation with the market's. Eg, if you think paying 20x earnings (20 PE) for a company today is a fair price, but the market is valuing that same company at 15x earnings (15 PE) then it might suggest that it's underpriced – at least based on your analysis. But there is no simple rule like if a stock trades for 10 PE you should buy.

PE and PB are also extremely fuzzy metrics. There are lots of reasons why a company might have very high or very low PE & PB without it being a reflection of mispricing. And for a lot of stocks PE and PB are basically useless.

Your understanding of PE and PB is correct, but I suspect you're lacking the depth of understanding to use these metrics productively. I'm happy to try to answer any specific questions you might have, but keep in mind this stuff is really difficult and takes a long time to understand. Even when you've been doing this for years there are still things you learn all the time which can help you value companies better.

However, if you're just looking to make a few casual investments you're generally fine to use PE as a sanity check. Eg, if you're buying a solid company and it's trading around a market PE then even if you're not getting the best deal, it's also unlikely you're making a massive mistake.",kriptonicx,1,/r/stocks/comments/127dttg/questions_about_pe_and_pb/jeehb57/,0.062,0.798,0.141,0.9704

The trick is figuring out what is too low or too high. 

That said I tend to ignore PB on EPS positive stocks unless it's unusually low. 

I do look at PE but I prefer comparing it to forward PE. 

For example, lots of people might be avoiding buying a stock with a PE of 40 but it's forward PE is sat at 10. 

As for PB I really just use it on companies not turning a profit yet but growing well and try not to buy above book value. That's definitely not a science but you have to pick a price somehow.

203,CPA," >  but as of right now the high p/e companies are overvalued?

Depends - you can't just declare ""overvalued / undervalued"" by looking at a single multiple in a vaccuum. Where does their forward P/E stack up against their industry peers? What about EV / 2023E EBITDA or P / 2023E OCF or Net Debt / LTM EBITDA? 

Is the ticker in question trade higher on a multiples basis across all of those buckets (save for net leverage, you want that multiple to be low, not high)? Then, yeah, it's probably overvalued. If not, then you need to do some more dilligence. 

Forward P/E as a baseline valuation benchmark isn't the best to use since you're comparing industry peers on a GAAP-based metric (net income) that can be influenced by 

* cashless charges like impairment, DD&A, stock-based compensation
  * .......while also ignoring items materially affecting near-term cashflow, mainly changes to net working capital, so liquidity is completely ignored

* tax regime
 * net income is an after-tax metric
 * comparing peers domiciled in different countries makes this an apples-to-oranges comparison

* capital structure 
  * net income includes interest expense, which is another GAAP based metric that won't reflect the exact cash outlay for interest payments during the period on a dollar-for-dollar basis - there's a smoothing mechanism involved re: interest expense on the IS vs cash paid on interest obligations on the SCF

221,AI," But why would they? As I said, there are fully featured free alternatives already that the people you know could just as easily use.

If, say, Davinci Resolve or Affinity (not free but cheaper) gets killer AI features built in that save loads of time and happen to somehow be leagues ahead of Adobe and they don't bother catching up then maybe some people will switch. I don't see that happening either, seeing as Adobe has an insane amount of funds and staff to waste on that stuff compared to their competitors - but I don't think that's the scenario you're describing anyway.

Edit: Take editing a very simple youtube video as an example. Let's say in your hypothetical scenario, a startup builds an AI that's essentially a website where a user can upload all their footage (time consuming even with a fast connection) and type in a prompt describing the general message they want to get across. It does a decent job but they want to go in and change the B-roll shots, add some sound effects, it didn't get the timing of your jokes, some of the cuts are a little awkward and the music levels aren't how you want it. Well, you can't do anything about it other than try and describe the problems and hope it understands.

In Premiere Pro the software can already transcribe your footage, and I believe in the latest beta version you can just cut and paste sections from that text transcription to build your sequence. It's not a huge leap to add the AI functionality to rearrange that transcription and give you a timeline based on a prompt, only now you can very easily work on it using the existing traditional tools. No free software is topping that.

Their theme park business is starting to recover and potentially they could spin that off and turn that into a separate business that the Disney family would continue to run (although they'd need an agreement on IP use).
