0,RH, How many people on other trading platforms lost potential gains because RH halted trading. Why is there not a class action law suit from those people. When RH halted trading it played a part in stopping the take off.

Yes,Vlad fucked up and his refusal to be transparent is what ultimately made him the scape goat. But think about it for a second. His lawyers probay put a gag order on him immediately because of the law suits. So really, he's doing the smartest thing by not really answering questions, legalwise.

40,AMC," Everyone owning GME stock got screwed, regardless of broker.

If Robinhood had informed the exchange of what it was doing, my opinion is that the exchange should have blocked all GME trading until things calmed down.

FWIW, with the quantity of hype the GME thing had going in the news and popularity amongst new retail investors (it takes time for stragglers to get the account ready and this can delay any fall - I've seen this several times before in another kind of trading), it had a good half a day or day remaining (and perhaps considerably more) before downward movement. Robinhood halted that early and ruined my plan (which was to likely sell around midday before sign of trouble).

48,RH," Can’t either way as RH is not public. But keep in mind that this fiasco may prevent any IPO period and more than likely any time soon which probably gives the RH team bunched up undies knowing their IPO dreams blew away with their actions.

Edit-maybe I’m losing my touch on reality. Looks like RH might IPO later this month. But seeing as they pissed so many people off I would still tend to believe that there will be less demand and thus lower the evaluation as they IPO.

49,GME," Exactly this.... I don't understand the robinhood hate when 9 out of 10 brokerages halted at practically the same time. None of my buddies on different brokerages could buy GME either.

My probably inaccurate, at the very least oversimplified, understanding is that the DTCC is an exchange - level clearing house that all trades go through after the brokerage - level clearing firm does its thing. They're the ones that requested a massive deposit due to volatility. Well the NSCC did, but they're a subsidiary of the DTCC.

So why the robinhood hate? As far as I can tell it's just because they're the most used retail brokerage and therefore the halt was the most visible through them.

Fidelity is nice when it comes to instant buying power/liquidating positions and strong financial backing (no halted sell/buy orders), but it gets hung up on AfterHourse / Pre-Market limit orders.  For example for a Pre-Market order, it forces one to wake up at 4:00 am EST to place that Pre-Market limit for that session - that order is either killed of filled by end of morning, and it cannot be placed the night before.  Another struggle, is that Fidelity is enforcing a restriction on placing limit orders more than 50% above the current stock price.  With a GME average over 115, I have the pleasure of waking up everyday to place my limit orders in Fidelity to cover my ass in Pre-Market/After Hours.

**Webull has been the best.**  It lets me place limit orders between 4:00 am - 20:00 pm EST.  Once a limit order is placed, I can modify it at any time - makes it really nice for this situation where I might have limits at $420.69, that suddenly need to jump to $4,269.69.  The drawback from Webull, is in the buying power/credit.  On Fidelity, I can quickly liquidate and account and immediately turn around and use the gains to buy more.  On Webull, you have to wait the T+2 before that cash comes back around for spending.  They could have different account levels to allow more credit, but still annoying that you can't really buy'n'sell all day, unless you have unlimited cash balance. The graphs, statistics, and financials on Webull are hands down the best between the three.  Download the Desktop app on your PC and you'll jazzmforshazzm.

Robinhood is the most limited for entire market, they run from 9:00 am - 6:00 pm EST.  RH does well with allowing a limit orders at any price and it lets the orders persist over night.  As long as your limit order is placed by 6:00 pm EST the night before, it should execute in the AM pre-market.  However, unlike Webull, Robinhood only lets you cancel a limit order; it does not give an option to modify the quantity or price.  So if you want a good pre-market order, you better make an accurate guess at 6:00 pm the night before, or be ready at 6:00 am to replace with another or cancel.

But, as a toddler, about the worst I did was throw a tantrum because I thought that my parents walked me into an incredible arcade-playground thing, then just walked me back out just to taunt me. I just didn’t understand enough English at the time to understand they needed to buy me socks as shoes weren’t allowed and I only had little baby sandals on.

120,GME," Why I am no longer stressed about GME:

I believe it will moon. When it does, I will know. I will get the best price from the hedgies. I don’t know when. It could be today or this week or this month or more. When it happens, I’ll watch, I’ll wait, I’ll HODL till they are bled out, I’ll take my tendies and do beautiful things in my life/community.

Until then, I don’t care if it drops. No stress. If it goes below 100, I’ll average down more. Great opportunity. Nothing to fear.

If there is no squeeze, well, I beleive DFV that there is deep f****ing value for GameStop. My average is $155 @ 31 shares. Worst care scenario: I wait until GameStop surpasses my average in the long run. That’s okay.

TLDR:

GME moons some day, I win.
GME drops: I average down: I win.
GME doesn’t moon but grows into a gaming powerhouse company: I HODL longer but I eventually win.

We win.

123,DD," # Things we should keep in mind today:

&#x200B;

* There is no way to predict when the squeeze will happen
   * There will be crazy price action in both directions
   * This can go on as long as the shorts remain solvent
   * The longer they drag this out, the higher it goes
   * People might say, ""Lift-Off in 10!"" But they're just excited
   * Nobody knows when it'll happen or how high it will go
      * Use your favorite service to set price alerts so that **when** the squeeze happens, you'll be ready. Everyone's looking out for it, and nobody wants to risk missing out, so get notified.

Basically, don't believe the hype, but feel free to join in. You should do your own research, read the DD, and make informed decisions. Don't invest money you can't afford to lose.

In other words, **fuck safely, or you'll get fucked.**

&#x200B;

* There is no ""we.""
   * I'm holding because that's my choice. I believe in GME
   * I will not buy because someone else says to do so
   * I will not encourage others to buy
   * Nothing I say is financial advice
   * If you're confused, read the rules. No market manipulation.
      * All references to the words ""we"" and ""us"" in this post refer to individual retail investors who believe that GME is drastically undervalued and make their own decisions and do their own research.

Report posts that encourage everyone to buy at the same time. The primary reason for this is legal, but the secondary is that the media will cherry-pick comments like this to give us a bad name and put more negativity out there through their articles, broadcasts, etc.

&#x200B;

* There will be plenty of FUD (or ""fear, uncertainty, and doubt"")
   * I am including this out of belief, if not pure spite
   * There are redditors being paid to scare you
   * There are bots made to SPAM negativity
   * There are people profiting when you sell
   * This starts ramping up in the afternoon

There are two sides to this fight, and we have to remember that there are people profiting if we fail. There are people playing the other side who *will* come into the thread and try to throw us off track by ruining the morale. We mustn't give in to them. Besides, they can't even provide any good DD for their bear-case, it's all just ""*sElL iT's OvEr.*""

* We can fucking do this

They'll do whatever they can (manipulate the market, short the stock further, short EFTs, etc.) for as long as they can manage, all hoping we'll give up and sell (Hell, they've even tried to bore us to death). But they don't understand just how dumb we really are. We are far too stupid to be afraid of their fearmongering, and we'll hold 'til the moon.

&#x200B;

* Important reminders
   * Don't give yourself a heart attack by staring at the chart all day
   * Drink water. Just take a sip every time you look at the chart
   * If the squeeze doesn't happen today, that doesn't mean it's over

&#x200B;

* If you're new, this may not be for you
   * This is something you have to be really brave or really stupid for
   * You will either see enormous gains or enormous losses
   * Invest wisely, don't spend your rent money, and read the DD
   * Read the DD

      * DD is short for Due Diligence, and it's basically just researching a stock before you buy in. There's plenty of great DD on this sub, and you can sort by the DD flair to see the highest-voted posts. Do that before asking dumb questions and risking your karma.

It doesn't need to be put at the top of the sub, just make it and let us post there. It's extremely frustrating to have to guess if we will get a thread or not.

(just putting this out there for everyone as a reminder and as a quick crash course for any new prospective GMEers)

THINGS WE KNOW ABOUT GME FOR THIS WEEK (first week in March):


1. DFV is a beast and we honestly owe a lot to him.
2. We crushed the $100 resistance level out of the park and very well may have established a NEW FLOOR at $117. Finishing above $120 in regular market hours yesterday was HUUUUUGE as it shows a commitment to the witching hour from the masses.
4. According to people who actually commit their lives to understanding trends in the stock market, our NEXT RESISTANCE LEVEL will be at $126. This may be our next potential fight, and as such we need to be prepared to send it into the stratosphere as soon as we see it start to dip at that level.
5. BUY THE MINI DIPS! Waiting for the ‘right’ moment isn’t going to happen on a stock like this. Any dip is going to be quickly corrected and if you wana make the most out of things it’s in your best interest to pump it up as soon as you see negative movement - whether you have stock in GME already or not.
6. The more people that buy more and hold, the better chance we have of getting ourself triple digit+ gains. This means that NO ONE SHOULD SELL TODAY. This is not your typical stock. There is a mission behind this onslaught, and you better understand it. This only works if everyone gets on board and stays on board. 
7. There are PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACTS on the masses whenever we fuel the jet. Whenever a true stock rocket is taking off, everyone and their mother hops on. That’s how this works. When someone sees a sure way to make money for free, they do it. It’s that simple. And it makes sense. Thus, whenever we see a rocket, the more and more we pump it up —> the more people jump on —> the higher the resistance level we create. Pretty numbers like 150 and 200 are both extremely exciting and terrifying to people. People will doubt those numbers are reachable, but once those barriers are hit there is some involuntary reflex that says “fuck it” and more people hop on and FOMO their tits to Valhalla. While this may typically be a less than stellar idea in normal circumstances, it is the best thing that could happen right now. And make no mistake, IT WILL HAPPEN in the curious case of GME.
8. The amount of options in place at 150, 200, and 800 is truly RIDICULOUS. The likelihood of this thing rocketing to a realm where the gains legitimately changes peoples’ lives, their children’s lives, and their grandchildren’s lives for the better is not just a pipe dream.
9. This is not going to come without it’s trials and tribulations. The stock market has ebbs and flows, even with an atypical situation like this. PAPER HANDS ARE YOUR WORST ENEMY. Don’t get fooled by market manipulation or a slight dip. This thing is going up whether you think it is or not. You can either be a part of history and change your economic sustainability or watch from the sidelines as others have the courage to change their lives forever. DIAMOND HANDS WILL SET YOU FREE.

161,NEW," 🦍🦍🦍💎💎💎CALLING ALL FELLOW DIAMOND SHAFTED HEROS AND FELLOW APES💎💎💎🦍🦍🦍

(just putting this out there for everyone as a reminder and as a quick crash course for any new prospective GMEers)

THINGS WE KNOW ABOUT GME FOR THIS WEEK (first week in March):


1. DFV is a beast and we honestly owe a lot to him.
2. We crushed the $100 resistance level out of the park and very well may have established a NEW FLOOR at $117. Finishing above $120 in regular market hours yesterday was HUUUUUGE as it shows a commitment to the witching hour from the masses.
4. According to people who actually commit their lives to understanding trends in the stock market, our NEXT RESISTANCE LEVEL will be at $126. This may be our next potential fight, and as such we need to be prepared to send it into the stratosphere as soon as we see it start to dip at that level.
5. BUY THE MINI DIPS! Waiting for the ‘right’ moment isn’t going to happen on a stock like this. Any dip is going to be quickly corrected and if you wana make the most out of things it’s in your best interest to pump it up as soon as you see negative movement - whether you have stock in GME already or not.
6. The more people that buy more and hold, the better chance we have of getting ourself triple digit+ gains. This means that NO ONE SHOULD SELL TODAY. This is not your typical stock. There is a mission behind this onslaught, and you better understand it. This only works if everyone gets on board and stays on board. 
7. There are PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACTS on the masses whenever we fuel the jet. Whenever a true stock rocket is taking off, everyone and their mother hops on. That’s how this works. When someone sees a sure way to make money for free, they do it. It’s that simple. And it makes sense. Thus, whenever we see a rocket, the more and more we pump it up —> the more people jump on —> the higher the resistance level we create. Pretty numbers like 150 and 200 are both extremely exciting and terrifying to people. People will doubt those numbers are reachable, but once those barriers are hit there is some involuntary reflex that says “fuck it” and more people hop on and FOMO their tits to Valhalla. While this may typically be a less than stellar idea in normal circumstances, it is the best thing that could happen right now. And make no mistake, IT WILL HAPPEN in the curious case of GME.
8. The amount of options in place at 150, 200, and 800 is truly RIDICULOUS. The likelihood of this thing rocketing to a realm where the gains legitimately changes peoples’ lives, their children’s lives, and their grandchildren’s lives for the better is not just a pipe dream.
9. This is not going to come without it’s trials and tribulations. The stock market has ebbs and flows, even with an atypical situation like this. PAPER HANDS ARE YOUR WORST ENEMY. Don’t get fooled by market manipulation or a slight dip. This thing is going up whether you think it is or not. You can either be a part of history and change your economic sustainability or watch from the sidelines as others have the courage to change their lives forever. DIAMOND HANDS WILL SET YOU FREE.

This is not a Gamma squeeze, after riding to $170 last week in 45 minutes, then tumbling down until it set a floor around $100, THAT is how a gamma squeeze behaves. A short squeeze slowly works it’s way up over days-weeks, and there are absolutely red days. Shorts are playing catch up and trying to drive the price down so that they can shake as many people free as possible to regain some shares,cover with them, and buy back to lower their average interest rate. 

They are stalling the inevitable and trying to keep their loss as low as they can, but they still don’t have the shares to cover, so we are .... “squeezing them” until they have nothing left to cover with and they have to buy from us.

down to 55k shares again. 

Just so everyone understands the “Fee” percentage, those numbers increase the longer you hold shares. So, when it lowers (especially as shorts hold the same estimated figure), they are borrowing more at a lower fee and replacing what they’ve covered at high fees. This is normal, they are attempting to avoid a squeeze by lowering their late fee average (same as we do by buying the dip to lower our average) so they can slow the bleeding. It is a waiting game, stay vigilant.

Back up to 250k, bringing the price back down with it. Just so everyone understands, the squeeze may not hit on this wave. They’ve driven their borrow fee down to 3.1%. If they get it down to where they want, it’s possible that they’ll sit on it and short the stock slowly back down until the same things happens at the end of March. It is absolutely a hold situation and a waiting game, they will prolong the inevitable as long as possible, but the fact remains ... they will have to cover at some point. Many people will sell because they don’t want to deal with the stress, the shorters know that as well. HOLD.

445,EVER," As i explained in another reply, the -80% came from a few failed commodities play. I rode the commodities boom in early 2010s so when Trump was promising China was ready to buy a LOT of commodities in the biggest trade deal EVER, I positioned myself on the long side trying to front run the Chinese government. Obviously that never happened and the market tanked while I was over leveraged. Did that a few times as Trump kept promising this time it will happen until I ran out of money. Ironically commodities are only now rallying after a change of government... 

The major comeback gains was from anticipating the covid drop and subsequent rally. (A bear gang actually existed in wsb back then)

Like some here said, whatever stocks u picked over the past didn’t really matter much. They all fell and rose at the same time. The key was anticipating the overall sentiment. And here is where wsb is best. Wsb is the voice of the market and gives us retail traders a forum to congregate we would otherwise never have unless we are a wall street insider.

Their IWM puts are 6 billion

IWM calls are 4 billion

Their index IWM shares 1 billion

Individual companies shares in IWM around guesstimate 50 billion. so they are 10 times more long in IWM than they are short.

their holdings in 2000 companies in IWM im not gonna search 1 by 1, but i would estimate they long 10 times bigger in individual stocks of IWM than they are short. short is just for hedging.

With GME susquehanna has $46 million in GME shares and $34 million in GME calls and $90 million in GME puts. so technically they are definitely long and betting on volatility spike (and assuming they held on the first squeeze, they saw profits of $1 billion more being long GME if they liquidate at just halfway top)

would love to see a NET long/short position instead of only filtering puts as filtering puts is really not a complete enough indicator to know whether a company's actually long or short.

also, this data are from 2 months ago.. on the first squeeze a lot of these positions are definitely shuffled around. some going long, some going neutral, some going short.

1. as the prince increases the overall buying power of the wendy's paychecks will diminish, thus creating alot less retail volume.
2. im definitely no naive enough to think that all the ""diamond hands"" will hold like they say, if this reaches 1k, people will start folding and it will start to slow and deflate the movement.
3. and even if im wrong about no. 2, if it gets anywhere near 10k, people will definitely start to fold and at that price point it will collapse the GME movement altogether.
4. and if im wrong about no. 3, 100k will have serious, almost catastrophic financial effects for wall street and the market in general. will the government let that happen? probably not.

I would love to see 100k, and from what ive read the data supports it, but thats only raw math and doesnt take in consideration the variable of people starting to fold and cashing out the stock early.

641,GME," This thing is not reaching 100k or 10k and people who keep saying this are just going to cause all the retards who will blindly follow to hold their shares to long and miss out on any gains just like the first time around.

1k is possible but even than there would be incredible market volatility and you would see the entire market completely shit itself and go into the deep red probably greater than -7% in one day and panic would ensue.  Look what happened when GME hit nearly $500 the first time around, the market was literally being uprooted by hedge funds who were liquidating positions in order to buy to cover so that they didn't get margin called as GME kept spiking potentially to 1k.  This whole situation goes way beyond what people think, GME is a major underpinning of the market right now and has had alot more sway on recent volatility than people think because the media will always just create a reason to fit their agenda, this time it was an uptick in bond yields.

TLDR; Sell at your own price and don't miss out on huge gains just because people are saying ""this thing is going to 5k"" like no it really isn't, it won't even come close to that.

I really disagree with the sentiment in this post, you are giving people false hope, and taking advantage of them at worst.

Are you telling newbies and fellow apes to hold until some fantasy price that never materializes so you can get out near the actual top of a potential squeeze based on your own profit goals?

There are some people that might actually believe the stock can go to $100,000 and hold past a $500 top, or a $1,000 top, when they could have used those profits to pay a bill and get on a solid ground financially.

687,ALL," Well I am by no means an expert, but I'll give my logical reasoning and what little historic evidence I know of.

First off, what can we look at. Even though it is not a very similar to the GME situation, take a look at the VW squeeze in 2008 on 1 day interval chart (the 1 week interval chart usually shown is easily mistaken for a 'few seconds peak and you'll miss it', in fact it traded at that peak for 4-5 days. Go to yahoo finance, go to VOW.DE, make the date range 5Y, make the interval 1D and scroll to the side till 2008 and zoom in on 4th quarter of 2008 to see this yourself.

So the logical reasoning then. Assume that NOW is a point in time where the short squeeze is triggered for real. You can argue that the short squeeze is in small effect all the time as the stock is rising, but what I mean by the triggering is that the die-hard hopium consuming players who did not consider it an option to cover before have NOW expended ALL the tricks up their sleeve and it did not work, therefore NOW they pivoted to the opinion that it's not going to get any better. Nothing worked, suddenly that scenario that was not allowed to happen is the reality and they are forced to recognize it and act on it. The bet with all the tricks was lost and only served to exacerbate the problem they NOW face, still, NOW there is a best course of action. Furthermore, NOW is determined from considerations of actually trying to save some sort of skin. The best way I can think of this is that I am assuming the guys in these positions actually have **not** adopted the 'watch the world burn, don't try to save anything, accelerate defeat and amplify the explosion as much as possible' philosophy but are trying to save *something*.

What happens? A meteoric rise in price happens, why? Consider 2 players getting squeezed, if player A sat back and allowed B to buy al their stuff first, player A would only start buying after the meteoric rise has already taken place, after all the 'cheap' (from the point of view of NOW) shares have been bought already. Moreover there is time hurting them further the longer they wait, which is what drove them to the point of pivoting their action course. 

Now consider HOW they will conduct their buying. If they put in the whole thing they need to buy and hit every ask in one instant, very rapidly they'd run out of asks and hit the astronomical asks (basically infinite price) AND THEY STILL WOULD NOT BE OUT, this is not economical in terms of NOW, and they would have shown the guys who did not have the time to approach with their sell offer what they are willing to buy it for. The dilemma then is that they need to get the shares that are cheap NOW (rush to buy) but also give time for new sellers to come in to sell their shares because in a lot of people's eyes the price will have risen enough. If you get it into your head, dear reader, that you can actually SET THE PRICE YOU WANT if you only realize it, accept it and remain convicted about it and make other apes realize this too. That is the effect of this realization, that fewer sellers will rush to sell even though a meteoric rise has occurred. It puts additional pressure on them in this situation so the price will rise to a higher level, which is what you want. Now there's always going to be an equilibrium because it's unrealistic for apes to coordinate and agree on infinite price unanimously. The realization that you choose the price sets the level of when the equilibrium is reached higher, that is, the level at which they can, within whatever time frame they have to get out, keep trickling buys in at the same pace as sellers flock to sell.

In this situation it is, for instance, my belief is that they're setting themselves up for a small time frame (what is small you may, ask, but it certainly is not in seconds, minutes or hours magnitudes because well it is not even be possible to get out of it in such a small amount of time) because they literally have not been able to fathom allowing this to take place, so when they finally pivot they'll be utterly and truly fucked. Add to that that I think a lot of people have a good quality of this realization that I'm talking about. Recipe for galaxy rise. The price increases until sellers flock to at the same rate that their deadline, whatever it is, has them buy at. The later that is reached, the higher the price goes.

If you get it into your head, dear reader, that you can actually SET THE PRICE YOU WANT if you only realize it, accept it and remain convicted about it and make other apes realize this too. That is the effect of this realization, that fewer sellers will rush to sell even though a meteoric rise has occurred. It puts additional pressure on them in this situation so the price will rise to a higher level, which is what you want. Now there's always going to be an equilibrium because it's unrealistic for apes to coordinate and agree on infinite price unanimously. The realization that you choose the price sets the level of when the equilibrium is reached higher, that is, the level at which they can, within whatever time frame they have to get out, keep trickling buys in at the same pace as sellers flock to sell.

In this situation it is, for instance, my belief is that they're setting themselves up for a small time frame (what is small you may, ask, but it certainly is not in seconds, minutes or hours magnitudes because well it is not even be possible to get out of it in such a small amount of time) because they literally have not been able to fathom allowing this to take place, so when they finally pivot they'll be utterly and truly fucked. Add to that that I think a lot of people have a good quality of this realization that I'm talking about. Recipe for galaxy rise. The price increases until sellers flock to at the same rate that their deadline, whatever it is, has them buy at. The later that is reached, the higher the price goes.

690,OUT," Well I am by no means an expert, but I'll give my logical reasoning and what little historic evidence I know of.

First off, what can we look at. Even though it is not a very similar to the GME situation, take a look at the VW squeeze in 2008 on 1 day interval chart (the 1 week interval chart usually shown is easily mistaken for a 'few seconds peak and you'll miss it', in fact it traded at that peak for 4-5 days. Go to yahoo finance, go to VOW.DE, make the date range 5Y, make the interval 1D and scroll to the side till 2008 and zoom in on 4th quarter of 2008 to see this yourself.

So the logical reasoning then. Assume that NOW is a point in time where the short squeeze is triggered for real. You can argue that the short squeeze is in small effect all the time as the stock is rising, but what I mean by the triggering is that the die-hard hopium consuming players who did not consider it an option to cover before have NOW expended ALL the tricks up their sleeve and it did not work, therefore NOW they pivoted to the opinion that it's not going to get any better. Nothing worked, suddenly that scenario that was not allowed to happen is the reality and they are forced to recognize it and act on it. The bet with all the tricks was lost and only served to exacerbate the problem they NOW face, still, NOW there is a best course of action. Furthermore, NOW is determined from considerations of actually trying to save some sort of skin. The best way I can think of this is that I am assuming the guys in these positions actually have **not** adopted the 'watch the world burn, don't try to save anything, accelerate defeat and amplify the explosion as much as possible' philosophy but are trying to save *something*.

What happens? A meteoric rise in price happens, why? Consider 2 players getting squeezed, if player A sat back and allowed B to buy al their stuff first, player A would only start buying after the meteoric rise has already taken place, after all the 'cheap' (from the point of view of NOW) shares have been bought already. Moreover there is time hurting them further the longer they wait, which is what drove them to the point of pivoting their action course. 

Now consider HOW they will conduct their buying. If they put in the whole thing they need to buy and hit every ask in one instant, very rapidly they'd run out of asks and hit the astronomical asks (basically infinite price) AND THEY STILL WOULD NOT BE OUT, this is not economical in terms of NOW, and they would have shown the guys who did not have the time to approach with their sell offer what they are willing to buy it for. The dilemma then is that they need to get the shares that are cheap NOW (rush to buy) but also give time for new sellers to come in to sell their shares because in a lot of people's eyes the price will have risen enough. If you get it into your head, dear reader, that you can actually SET THE PRICE YOU WANT if you only realize it, accept it and remain convicted about it and make other apes realize this too. That is the effect of this realization, that fewer sellers will rush to sell even though a meteoric rise has occurred.

Now there's always going to be an equilibrium because it's unrealistic for apes to coordinate and agree on infinite price unanimously. The realization that you choose the price sets the level of when the equilibrium is reached higher, that is, the level at which they can, within whatever time frame they have to get out, keep trickling buys in at the same pace as sellers flock to sell.

941,GME," There really is something going on with this stock.. I’m not a seasoned trader.. I’m still very much learning in this process. What I can say is that I’ve not seen anything absolutely irrefutable with evidence on what is really making this stock do what it’s doing except the power of ape +Diamond hands. With that being said , the other week I tested the waters and sold 1.4 shares @138 .. I received a message saying a fraction of those shares were sold at 32.99 and the remaining balance would be given to me at the balance cost per share because there weren’t enough shares . 
Who named that price of 32.99? THEY DID!! 
Why?  I find it very odd that Robinhood started fraction selling right after they suspended trading on GME/AMC . But now it’s right in front of our ape faces... they are selling fractions based on the millions in movement per day at an extremely low price to throttle the rocket. Unless I’m absolutely retarded (please correct me if so)

I noticed a somewhat linear trend in GME so I put 3 points in a spreadsheet, took the trendline, and realized it was a bit more curved then linear so I called it a polynomial trend and joked with some friends that my 3 data points predict that GME was going to be $300 to $400 by Friday's end and the trend continued all the way up until the middle of the trading day today.

If GME closes around $140 then I think the confirmation bias momentum will carry it until the next big catalyst creates some other trend reinforced by confirmation bias.

1072,UK," Pre-pandemic salaries in London, UK for senior (non-lead) devs were £60-75k. An average house was £400-600k. And when I say 'average' I mean shitty 60s build terraced/semi-detached with paper thin walls, and probably not in a very safe area. Of course you could have bought one outside Greater London for 200-250k, then spent 3+ hours a day commuting. However, the situation is even worse now, and post-lockdown I imagine a lot of employers will still be asking for 1-3 days a week in the office.

Right now, if you're fully remote and anticipate staying remote, you can buy a new build 3 bedroom house in a random area of the UK but still potentially within commuting distance of a major city for 280-300k (what you call a bedroom here in the UK is really only big enough to fit a desk and a chair, so take ""3 bedrooms"" with a grain of salt). With a shitty 85LTV mortgage that's a £45k deposit. For 75LTV it's £70k. If you manage to consistently put away £800 a month, 45k would take you 4.6 years. But let's be real, how many people can afford to put away £800 per month? For 4 to 5 fucking years.

Guess I'll just keep driving my shitty 12 year old car and spend my 3 week annual leave doing house chores and masturbating.

1077,GME, They are always after the little guy. Did the security funds not (for decades) short stocks regardless if people lost ( their livelihoods)? Do hedge funds add anything to growth? Do big players not move business for better Labor rates (China)? Do they care when countries love the new money gravy train they get more greedy and threaten (China). Do they care if your kids and grandkids have to go to war to keep the power balance? (They make more money during war). The GME story is about the average person taking some control over the countries destiny. Where people can decide what business they want and where they want growth. With that system works for the people rather than sell out hippies.,1st-Redrum,45,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw01wq/reuters_dfv_is_expected_to_appear_before/gpeps0y/,0.08,0.75,0.17,0.9001

1079,RH," the thing that pisses me off the most about this is that lawsuits are on of the few tools actually available to the general population for seeking justice when they are screwed over. if anyone lost money because of DFV it is their own gd fault, or the fault of RH and their backers. This kind of malevolent, dishonest lawsuit going after people trying to improve their own lives by participating in a public idea sharing forum is morally bankrupt and completely antithetical to any real notion of justice. just more legalized corruption.

1080,MA," This  is fucking ridiculous. DFV has never made any pretense of giving financial advice here (he knows better). We just like the stock. We constantly make clear that you should not build a portfolio based on what we do because we're smooth-brained, crayon-eating fucking apes who don't even have an exit  strategy. We do that for a reason. Nobody lost money because of DFV. If anyone lost money who isn't a hedgie or an astroturf alias of one, it's because they followed self-described morons when they were openly talking about how unsound their financial strategy was.

I'll tell you who does cause investors to lose money: the fucking hedges. They find an easy target to fucking destroy, then they use strategies like naked shorting, shit that should be illegal, to manipulate the  market and artificially inflate their short position, then destroy their  easy targets using lies and criminal behavior. They dredge up literal  fake news stories, feed it to the press, and those dumbasses somehow eat  the shit up, then broadcast that it to the whole country and world. And it apparently has never occurred to media elites not to use as their sole source of information people with an obvious conflict of interests. What causes bubbles and instances of market manipulation is shorting practices which any  ape in ECON102 would tell you is fucking dangerous. If any market can be ""manipulated"" by people literally just having stock (and making memes about the fact that they have / like the stock), the architects of that market are probably fucking troglodytes.

I  can't believe these dumbasses are investigating a YouTuber / Redditor, not people who actually hold the necessary power to engage in financial practices that caused a bubble to be possible. They're interrogating everyday schmucks who engage in literally just having  shares, and those responsible are laughing their asses all the way to  the fucking bank. If the morons in MA are actually dumb enough to blame  us, this will only be the first bet of many. The media will move on, but  we'll still be here making bets that stick it to the fucking rich pricks  and powerful morons standing between us and crispy motherfucking  chicken tendies.",ninjapenguin120,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw01wq/reuters_dfv_is_expected_to_appear_before/gpfdcp6/,0.117,0.803,0.079,-0.9035

1090,GME," I highly doubt WSB would allow him to lose his gains from GME regardless. If they try to fine him for what he made we’ll just start a GoFundMe for him. 

Do the math on that: at an average donation of $20 / user who donates and assuming only 1% of users actually donate (which I think is a tremendous low-ball number, considering the number of people he’s brought to WSB, the amount of money people have made from GME, and the media attention), he’d receive over $1.8MM. 

I’d say he’d be more likely to get closer to 10-20% of users to donate an average of $20 each. He’d more than likely clear between $18MM-$36MM.

1110,ALL," Let me start by saying your intuition has led you to a *very* plausible outcome, and I think your conclusions are correct, but the steps you've taken to get there are a little bit off.

Delta is the rate of change in the value of a position as the share price changes. 

Gamma is the rate of change in delta as the price changes. 

It's not necessarily that a call goes in-the-money, and then the whole thing needs to be hedged all at once.

It's that calls that are far out of the money have low delta, and calls deep in the money have very high delta.

As the share price increases, call options that are in, at, and out of the money *all* increase in delta. By how much depends on their gamma value.

Example: right now the GME $150 call has a delta of .38 the market maker who wrote that contract would currently own about 38 shares to remain delta neutral on that contract. If the price gaps up to $150, the delta will rise to somewhere around .55 or so. For each call they wrote at $150 they would then buy around 17 more shares to remain delta neutral. (100 shares per contract *  (.55 - .38))

So it's not a binary operation of in-the-money = buy shares, out-of-the-money = dump shares. ALL (okay...most of) the open options are constantly being hedged according to their own delta. 

Call options for March 5th around $40 and below are already at > .99 delta. Their price moves nearly identically to 100 shares. Their Gamma is now 0, because their delta literally can't go up any further. Market Makers would already own 100 shares for each call at $40 or below. But for calls at *every* strike price from $40 all the way to $800, the delta will increase as the share price does.

So what you are describing toward the end of your post is exactly what a gamma squeeze is. It's nothing to do with settlement, and everything to do with hedging to stay delta neutral ahead of expiration as the share price rises. With such low liquidity, the need to purchase shares to hedge against rising delta causes the share price to rise even higher, causing the need for more hedging, which raises the price even more.... And then boom, squoze.",hyperian24,93,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvpcrq/gme_direct_correlation_crossing_option_strike/gpdp2vq/,0.025,0.86,0.115,0.9883

1113,IMO," yes IMO, that is exactly how it happens... the moment the option strikes are crossed and become ITM, the market makers or institutions that sold them have to hedge buying more shares to remain Delta neutral... the sudden buying volume pushes the stock up further, as in what happened today as you said.

Also if this takes place close to the end of the day, institutions long the stock and speculating with further gains will most likely buy more shares to push it up further and try to close over a higher strike level (i.e. over 120).",Future-Trouble1234,22,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvpcrq/gme_direct_correlation_crossing_option_strike/gpd1zh7/,0.038,0.865,0.097,0.7258

1128,OI," Good morning Ladies, how yall feeling today?. 

It wouldn´t surprise me if we see a huge dip today. First of all, no restriction to shorters is in force today which means they´ll be shorting the stock like they did last week when we saw the price go back to 87$. Now they can short on the downtick again. Second, they need to drive the price down quickly as the OI in options grows for every dollar the stock raises. 

&#x200B;

I´m all in with 150@ 87$ and I´m not here for the short term. If a squeeze (gamma, short , delta or whatever) doesn´t happen in the next couple of weeks (I think it will) we have to take into account that the company is making changes, new management is on board and they have plans to leave behind the brick-an-mortar business model.

In this complex and crazy scenario with GME, gamma has a relationship with theta and vega, and those in turn impact delta, whether directly or indirectly.

We’d typically see (and saw the week of the big spike) huge jumps with 50k+ calls expiring ITM the prior week. That element has been missing and could possibly be explained by the DD here.

Which is fine with me. So I'm sneaking looks at the ticker and reading wsb and watching things on gme on the DL.

But with the volume seen the people holding it are driving the price up and that's important. If the prices kerp climbing the shorts eventually get tired of eating losses and start actually buying the stock. 

Which these aholes should've done from the beginning. But No.....they are like , "" lets naked shirt this run it to bankruptcy and then feed on it like scavenging parasites"".

Remember these shorts are destroying a part of your memory which you grew up with. They are destroying our GME legacy. 


Don't let them get away with this. The shorts are nothing but blood sucking leechers who feed on the hard earned money of others.

1361,DB," Do we have any postgres chads in the chat? I rewrote our bots to be able to do multiple things at once because the ""dense paragraph of logic iterating over every object"" approach was bogging down, and now I'm running into database locks because of all the relationships between the tables and the multiple workers.

I'm sinfully using autocommit mode and setting long hearbeats right now on rabbitmq just to try to get around it, which I'm sure is probably making it worse somehow. I tried to rewrite it for async yesterday, which I think was working, but the DB lock issue was even worse since there were more agents doing more shit.

What do.. using a managed digital ocean postgres instance and I'm not sure if that's causing the issue.

GME is more of a gamble but I do believe that it will go into another gamma squeeze but maybe not as big as the one that could have happen in January.

1597,AP," I'm not, as I did it myself, thank you.  I had $15k saved before I was 18 myself.  Yes, if you get a minimum wage job making $7 an hour, of course not.  But if you, you know, think, there are tons of ways to make solid money.  Good with your hands?  Flip used furniture on craigslist/fb marketplace. Free old wood furniture? Sand down, strip, paint. Takes literally a few hours, easy $300 for a dresser with $1 nickel hardware. 3 of them? 900 bucks.  

You are looking at this as some random teenager, which, most would be broke, but you're looking at it as if they are only working at burger king. 
But if you have a good head on your shoulders, literally even an adult can take this advice, you can make thousands from a side hustle alone, let alone doing things full time.  School ends at 2:45p and the work is a joke nowadays. 

People like you are the issue, thinking that just because someone was smart, or produced hardwork, or was creative, doesn't mean it can't happen.  It does, all the time.  This is what happens when you come from a household that has parents that are earners, or driven.  Instead of complacency.

Edit: before you cry that that is just one example, here is more:

Go mow lawns.  Most landscapers get $25-40 per trip these days, for an avg. sized home property of 8,000 sq ft parcel.  Go around your neighborhood offering $25 yourself.

A smart AP kid in math?  Design and post tutoring around local groups online for services.  Charge $30 an hour.  Plenty of affluent neighborhoods can afford that to get their little HunterJayden help.

I knew a kid that started offering cleaning homes when he was a teenager, $50/per floor.  He now services more then 100 homes with an average of $125 per cleaning.  He has himself, and one other person that works for him now.

So please, spare me the crocodile tears about how this can't be true, because those of you that say you can't, it is literally the opposite.  And actually achievable.",bullshitworklogin,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw6jo2/17_years_old_217_tickets_to_the_moon/gpgjnx5/,0.044,0.839,0.117,0.9766

1657,RKT," No, he bought lower and that was his cost basis. If he was not using margin, he started today with $80k in cash for the initial purchase of 370 contracts. Once bought, you own the options and don't ""need"" any money to hold if you bought in cash. If they go down and you sell you lose money, up and you gain money on sale.

It's extremely risky bet because options expire in 3 days and if RKT dropped $5, he'd be down a lot. 

Right now, things are looking good for RKT as all call options are ITM (in the money) meaning all calls can be exercised on Friday which leads to potential for gamma squeeze as shares need to be bought or exchanged to fulfill the calls.

Yesterday was a great day to get in calls. Most of the $25+ calls were under $1 ($100) and now all are worth $10 ($1,000).",ProcessMeMrHinkie,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwae0v/181840_gain_in_4_hours_from_rkt_time_to_give_my/gpgekin/,0.055,0.841,0.104,0.8484

1665,RKT," Cost basis = cost of asset -> what he paid for them. 

Correct, he can exercise the options if he wants to buy 100 shares on each contract (@$35 strike he'd need $3,500 per option). Or he can sell to someone that wants to buy 100 shares @ $35 strike price. Most people you see on here will sell the option instead of exercising it. 

DFV I believe sold many, but also exercised quite a few with the money he made from selling calls. 

The further out the option is the more expensive it is. The closer it is the cheaper it is. This is referred to as theta - the rate of decline in the value of an option with time. The closer you get to expiry, the less chance you have for big movements in the stock. LEAPs = far out options that are generally safer bets (in a bull market especially), but cost more.

It depends. For beginners in options and most people in general, you should ONLY ever: buy call options (think there is upside and you want to leverage cash on hand), sell covered calls (you own 100 shares and sell 1 call option) or sell put options (you like the stock and would like to buy at a price lower than it currently is at). Call option contract is bought up front - no daily charge. Covered call option is sold up front - if it hits, you need to give up your shares or buy to close. Put option contract is sold up front and you need to buy the stock (or buy the put to close) if it hits the strike (in which case you need money to buy 100 shares at strike price). If you saw the big short or read about HFs borrowing shares to short (and paying daily fees) you're reading about a different topic.

TLDR:

If you buy a call option with cash, the only thing you are risking is the cash you paid for the option. Weekly OTM (out of the money - strike price is higher than current price) calls are extremely risky bets that more often than not fail to hit.

1684,GME, The best reference I saw someone use for whats going down on Wallstreet now is the synthetic CDO scene from the big short. When they explained that fake shares are made from synthetic longs then they short those shares even though they arent real shares. They are betting on a bet to pay off. In the big short they say the synthetic CDOs were 20x bigger than the actual housing market. With GME its similar in that there could be more fake shares than real theoretically.  There is now way all the GME shares owned now are real. It seems to be a similar case with a lot of other shorted companies just not as bad.,ChErRyPOPPINSaf,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw383o/mememageddon_march_19th_quadruple_witching_amc_bb/gpftuqv/,0.06,0.799,0.141,0.8573

1718,AMC," If all this stuff is wrong about being squeezed it will tank, then it accidentally gets pumped by all the people buying for ""value"" then it gets fomo'd and then it gets dumped. But this would happen a week or two after the ""event"" It could still be squeezed but it would be another month down the road if this happens, they can always just pay interest.

So for AMC if it doesn't get squeezed it will run up to lets say 15 off the hype that it might get squeezed. So instead of it being squeezed on march 19th it might get dumped on march 19th. Whick makes the value play pump and dump either march 26th or april 1st. A 9dollar march 26th or a 9 dollar april first has a higher chance of profiting if I am right because so many people will know about it that it becomes a sell the news type of event.

If it pumps you can still sell it early, if it doesnt pump you have more time to wait, if it tanks well it rose off the hype so your itm calls should still have value.

AMC from 9 to 15, but then 15 to 10 9 8 7, then the ""value pump"" would bring it to 8 9 10 11 and then you sell the call as a FD to someone who think value pump is the squeeze.",Init_4_the_downvotes,15,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw383o/mememageddon_march_19th_quadruple_witching_amc_bb/gpftrme/,0.056,0.833,0.111,0.9423

I don't believe this is any different and I honestly don't blame him. He has a business to run. This is the accumulation phase. It's like FB, a future blue chip. They accumulated for 2 years. But I definitely see this as a bull trap. Run it up after hours, sell it to unsuspecting bulls. Collect premiums. On the chart, I see a big double top setting up. March 10th, all the divvy players are out => sell off, right in time to expire all those institutional contracts out of the money for quad witching. Oh and guess what’s waiting below? A big gap down to the low 20s. Coincidence? We’ll see. I kind of lost a lot of faith in management after losing 30k in options after 2nd earnings. I couldn’t even get out with less loss because we had no organic movement just day after day of pinning. Radio silence. 

Granted, I could very well be wrong and I hope I am. I've reduced my position SIGNIFICANTLY because of the opportunity cost all this time. Still holding through for the long run.

I don't believe this is any different and I honestly don't blame him. He has a business to run. This is the accumulation phase. It's like FB, a future blue chip. They accumulated for 2 years. But I definitely see this as a bull trap. Run it up after hours, sell it to unsuspecting bulls. Collect premiums. On the chart, I see a big double top setting up. March 10th, all the divvy players are out => sell off, right in time to expire all those institutional contracts out of the money for quad witching. Oh and guess what’s waiting below? A big gap down to the low 20s. Coincidence? We’ll see. I kind of lost a lot of faith in management after losing 30k in options after 2nd earnings. I couldn’t even get out with less loss because we had no organic movement just day after day of pinning. Radio silence. 

Granted, I could very well be wrong and I hope I am. I've reduced my position SIGNIFICANTLY because of the opportunity cost all this time. Still holding through for the long run.

TLDR: I think it'll run but I don't think this is it but I could definitely be wrong. We'll find out next week.

A. Retarded
B. Only know a little about calls myself 
C. Just likes this stonk. 

What I can say is that with buying a call you know your maximum loss potential up front. It's called the premium. If a premium price is .05 then the premium to buy in will cost you 5.00 (.05 x 100) 

So whatever the premium is.. you multiply by 100.. that's your maximum loss.. period. If you find a strike price you like and the premium and expiration are something that looks attractive to you and you think you can make money on... Then it's your choice to know if it's a value for your money.. risk reward wise. 

Mind you there are many metrics you can use to calculate your chances of success.. and always do your own dd or at least get that dd from a reputable source.

1790,GME," you didn't have to get IV crushed for your option to lose value even though the stock increases.

As you go further and further out of the money, your option's value becomes more and more sensitive to price movements AND time passing (as a percentage of its own value).

For example, your $800 call has a theta of -0.52, which means at this point it is losing 52 cents a day. The option's value is $3.6, so that's like 15 percent value lost a day.

It also has a delta of 0.09, meaning it gains 9 cents every for every dollar the stock moves up. Based on GME's stock price, this means that every 1% increase in stock value increases your option's value by 11 cents, which is 3% increase in your stock's value.

So at this moment every day you're losing 15%, and with every 1% GME gain you are gaining 3%. GME would have to gain 15% for you to even stop losing money on it daily.

1887,AGI," It's the money a company pays out to shareholders typically from profits.  Co's can make distributions to its shareholders and it can be interest or dividends (both are taxed at income).  Typically companies pay quarterly dividends or monthly interest.  If they want to declare a one time event, it's called a special dividend, meaning it's not recurring and that's what RKT did after going public 5 months ago!  That pay out gets translated to what's called a yield.  It's the yearly payout/share price. So that's the ability of your stock to make money.  I own a boatload of OXY which I bought last year.  They used to trade around $55 and paid out $.79 per quarter per share.  Dividends are not guaranteed and get declared each quarter.  In March 2020, they declared $.01 per share (yes, down from $.79).  I'm holding not only because my investment unrealized gain is $125% , but I am hopeful as the barrel price stays above $50, that they increase the dividend to $.02 or maybe .$05 a share, that's produces a lot of income.  But I have all kinds of stocks like that, my CCL unrealized gain 57% and used to pay out $.50 a quarter and cut to $.0.  CAKE (gain 183%) used to pay out $.36 a share, pays nothing.

You don't study charts as you've said, so when you ""make a decision on whether an option is high or low"" you're purely just looking for the Green or Red UI in Robinhood so you can ignore the values themselves?

And when you're saying things like ""I’m in it for money"" - who isn't? That's why I'm moving more and more away from Robinhood now that I have more money I'm investing. It can be worth paying commissions when I also get better prices when fulfilling my options orders. That part is purely anecdotal, but it also came up a lot in the recent Robinhood hearing..

I still use Robinhood for one of my accounts though, and I'd still recommend it to a lot of people.

1943,RKT," The stupidity of your first point is amazing.

RKT is a holding company for a subsidiary that it owns 5% of and the family that owns this owns the other 95% of. The family can convert their noncontrolling interest in the subsidiary for shares in RKT.

1964,HUGE," I'm a little confused about the motives of your post.

You say there's no way the owner hold 95% of the company, but your data doesn't show anything to refute that.  He wouldn't show up under ""institutional ownership""

""Institutional ownership is the amount of a company’s available stock owned by mutual or pension funds, insurance companies, investment firms, private foundations, endowments or other large entities that manage funds on behalf of others.""

In regards to the ""short"" squeeze, I don't recall reading anyone saying a short squeeze is imminent.  Again, your data doesn't imply it does have a relatively high position, it just shows there are other stocks with a HIGHER amount.

That doesn't directly refute anyone would have said about the stock being shorted.

-----------------

With that said, you're leaving out some of the bigger considerations for this stock, which I find rather odd:

- Their Q4 numbers were HUGE
- They are offering a special dividend for the first time.  
- They are expanding in numerous areas and their business is well aligned to minimize the impact of interest rate risk",beyerch,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw37yp/rktthere_has_been_some_misinformation_being/gpfme94/,0.047,0.877,0.076,0.8199

Many short holders close after hours, when there is low volume, driving the price up. It actually makes a lot of sense. No one was expecting a short squeeze, just that some shorts would cover.

2196,RKT," Everyone who owns a share of a company paying a dividend benefits as long as they hold the share on the settlement date (which is usually one day before the ex-div day).  The direct payment (i.e. dividend) is paid directly to your broker which gets distributed to you on the payment date ( March 23 in this case).  So as an example using RKT lets say:

On March 5 you purchase 1000 shares.  You are on the books as owning those shares before the settlement date requirement of March 8, so you are entitled to a dividend payment.  The dividend RKT is paying is $1.11 per share.  This means for every share you own, they are paying you $1.11 as a one time payment.  So at 1000 shares, you will receive a $1,100 payment on March 23 (the distribution date).  You do not need to continue to hold those shares past March 9 in order to receive the payment on March 23, you were in before the ex-div date and can exit at point there after and still get the div payment.

One thing to keep in mind though, the stock price WILL drop the same amount of the one time payment being made.  So if you have 1000 shares and are receiving $1,100 on March 23, the stock will also drop $1,100 in value for you on March 9.  So if you sell the stock directly after March 9 you have effectively made $0.  The dividend payment will equal the stock value drop for a net zero value.  That's why it makes sense to hold long term.  The goal is to take the div payment and continue to hold while the stock price continues to rise over the long term.  Many companies will issue quarterly dividends as a means of incentivizing investors to hold long term.    


Now imagine your 65 years old and have accumulated many many shares over your years of investing.  Lets say you at 65 owned 100,000 shares of this stock.  You would get a one time payment of $110,000.  If they continue to do this every year, you are making just off of this one stock a $110,000 a year salary from them essentially.  It could replace your job entirely, this is why BOOMERS love dividend stocks, no need to work to receive an annual salary.  It's also why Warren Buffett loves dividend stocks, compounding that salary year after year it grows exponentially.  Accumulating a stock like this that will be around for a long time is a worthy goal.",calipfarris01,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw1rh4/this_rkt_launch_is_steady/gpfgpb1/,0.019,0.862,0.119,0.9899

2199,OR," As of now, this is a ""special dividend"" which is a one time occurrence.  Not many companies do this, as a comparison Microsoft did this as well in 2004.  Had you been accumulating Microsoft over the years since 2004, you'd be doing pretty well today.  I think the special dividend is meant to show that they value the shareholders and payback that growth.  They want to be considered a fintech company though (a growth company) and not a value stock, so I would imagine they will resist issuing more dividends in the near term.  That doesn't mean 10 years from now they wont.  This is the kind of stock you hold on to (IMO) and don't worry about ""thinking it will dump"".  As I've described the price will take at least a 5% loss (probably more) after March 9th when people sell after the div payment.  What they don't realize is by doing that they are actually losing money. Yes they got the dividend but they also took the share price decrease and the additional decrease from the other sellers, which in the example above, would be more than the $1,100 you get issued (i.e. a net negative investment). You can short term play it if you like but your profits are only going to be in what the stock price rises between now and the div payment.  If you plan to sell directly after March 9, just know you are probably losing money.  You would need to hold after the 9th until the stock price rises a bit (hopefully).  OR you can just continue to hold a great stock, which to me is the better move.",calipfarris01,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw1rh4/this_rkt_launch_is_steady/gpfpo9h/,0.04,0.816,0.144,0.9756

2205,PD," I'll upvote for effort.  I don't think we are going to see much higher PD (probability of default) and LGD (loss given default) in the long run.  Short run QoQ, banks have been winding down their balance sheet fortresses because they have propriety credit models that estimate these calculations on a loan portfolio.  Clearly they are watching this very closely.  Also on this point, banks have a bigger problem.  They have too much money to lend.  See the M1 chart (yes, banks can't make loans fast enough in this environment).  We just aren't and most likely won't see decreased demand in the housing market with 1. rates being this low and 2. govt support for all credit facilities.

One point I would like to make and I know that others in here have already said this, but asking price is not down in many markets across the country.  I can confidently say this because I work in the industry for the largest title insurer in the country.  Many of our clients are dealing with low inventories and rising home prices because it is indeed still a seller's market.  Even more, when the pandemic scared everyone into thinking that no one would buy a house, the opposite occurred, 2020 was one of the best years to buy a house and many had career years.

2230,DD," Nice DD.  While I agree with most of it, I don't think we'll see a repeat of 2008, at least not nearly to the same level.  In 2008 home prices rose so sharply and this was partly due to issuing loans to people that otherwise should not have qualified for them.  This greatly increased demand for housing and supply / demand economics kicked in and prices skyrocketed.

Here in 2021 home prices have risen a decent amount in the last year, but most people that have bought a home in the last say 2-3 years or so will more than likely NOT be under water on their mortgage, unlike in 2008 where millions of Americans owed more on their mortgage than their home was worth.

I do think higher risk loans such as FHA loans will see a much higher forclosure rate than normal years.  And you know what might get hit hard, is PMI companies.  Yes private mortgage companies may face huge losses if houses start to get forclosed on.

Also homes are incredibly more expensive to build now due to lumber costing about 3x average in the last decade.  Couple that with ever increasing energy efficiency requirements that boost the cost of homes (e.g. solar requirement in CA) and ever increasing permits.  


My friend thats a lender said that he's seeing some concerning things happen in the real estate market.  Home affordability is a combination of purchase price and interest rate.  Interest rates have climbed quite a bit in the last month, so much so that some clients that got approved for say a 500K loan might now only qualify for 450K.  


So the home price gains in the last year coupled with rising interest rates have made homes considerably less affordable, and this will decrease demand as people will have to forgo home ownership.",Dual270x,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvpgzj/dark_dd_and_possible_profit_in_the_face_of/gpeda3y/,0.038,0.824,0.138,0.9873
2231,USA," I disagree with the bond market analysis

> That being said, bond sales are extremely unlikely to be as steady, or voluminous as they were in 1941, and that is going to force the Treasury to act more drastically in raising the yields. The stock market is going to suffer for it, probably, but more than anything the American Government is going to be setting itself up for disaster.

This is essentially a bet against the Fed and the effectiveness of yield curve control.  I'd back the infinite money printer in this fight, and in the short term they can keep yields wherever is most convenient.

> I don't necessarily believe China would demand a payback when we couldn't possibly do it, they may refuse to loan more to the USA, and that will be the trigger of the crisis which I'm about to explain.

China (and Japan) may refuse to loan more, but the Fed would step in as a lender of last resort, especially to prevent a crisis.

Overall, I suspect the Fed will stay solvent, and September is optimistic.  There will (probably) be a reckoning in the longer term for all of the money printing, QE, direct monetary financing, and various other central bank interventions - but I would look to forex/emerging markets as the trigger.

2236,USA," "" The US Government is increasing yields... "".  

As far as I know the US GOV doesn't increase bond yields, it is driven by market supply and demand.  However, the FED, not really the US government but still kinda is, can manipulate it through buying and selling.  Currently they are suppressing short term bond yields, and letting long term yields like the 10 year bond to increase, however, if long term bonds get to damaging the will use yield curve control (YCC). The FED has stated their main objective is bringing employment back up.  Letting the Yield get to out of control would tank employment, since a lot of loan rates are pegged to the 10 year yield, meaning business wouldn't be able to stay a float.   

""china... *may* refuse to loan more to the USA, and that will be the trigger of the crisis which I'm about to explain.""

Also, I find it hard to believe that china would stop buying bonds since their Yuan (dollar) is essentially tied to the success of our dollar.

I did note the extension of the mortgage moratorium in my analysis. I am theorizing that it will take until earnings are announced for Q3 or more likely Q4 (September to December 2021) for the real damage done to mortgage-lending banks to become public knowledge, but Banks are resilient and probably will be able to outlast the storm. Their stocks will probably dip, but doubtful they will plummet completely. 

It's the mass of people who have been on forbearance that are going to be hurt by this. Even with the moratorium, they have been accumulating debt that they have no means to pay off, especially when it comes to renters, who have NO protection whatsoever. Landlords are free to demand they instantly pay back ALL of their owed rend the day the moratorium ends.

The next 3 months after this is when the real damage will be realized, in my opinion. I don't know for certain. I'm not a realty investor or even an experienced investor.

Interest rates are at all time lows, you don't lower interest rates if you think the debtor can pay more.

Because no one can point to any company doing anything right now. Companies like CNK see 4 percent increases on 60 billion dollar losses, because it wasn't the 95 that was expected.

Other news I saw - not verified - is an increase to QE by $250B a month from $75B.. and then a draw down on the treasury balances for helicopter money. This was attributed to statements by Yellen. Be grateful if this could be confirmed. 
Helicopter money is consumer inflationary as more money chases goods, while reducing the Treasury balance sheet will likely impact assets such as equities unevenly with an average deflationary impact.

2263,DD," Hey, thanks for your counterpoint, and it's a valid one. Here is why I made my statements specific to your points.

Inventory is small right now in most of America, which I did consider in my analysis, about 1 Million homes available in inventory. The inventory right now should be around 3 million according to historical levels in order to be healthy. This is the reason for the astronomical prices. 

People are taking advantage, especially people who are in debt up to their necks and see an opportunity to get out. However, I'm seeing a massive shift between home-buying and selling. Land leasing and development companies took out huge loans for building new residential areas. In the states where I looked (pacific northwest) there plans for hundreds of thousands of new homes to be built, and the inventory out there is rising fast. Proportionally, house prices are falling in these areas, except California because well... it's California. Houses are expensive in California. It's just the way it is. 

If you do the math, with 9% of mortgages in default and hundreds of thousands if not millions of homes being built by land developers looking to take advantage of this seller's market, the amount of available houses is going to go up significantly over the next several months, I'm estimating well over 3 million homes will go on the market in the next few months, while at the same time, defaults continue increasing at an alarming rate until the pandemic officially ends. Remember that many people are still unemployed because of COVID, and a lot of companies went belly-up in the wake of it.

After July, unless Biden extends the eviction prevention moratorium (and several supreme court justices are saying that this is unconstitutional, so we can assume it is going to be rejected), there will be a swathe of evictions, and rent will go up sharply.

The big takeaway here is that people are going to be kicked out en-masse from their houses and apartments as banks, lenders, and landlords attempt to shore-up their profits. People won't be able to afford the same sized apartments when rent goes up. There will be a huge spike in the number of people that need to pick up their shit and go, and then they are going to need to put it somewhere.

Uhaul isn't the main DD here, but they are a very good indicator. Their stock has already risen sharply in the last several months, rising in tandem with the high default rates.

Moving & storage companies overall are going to be in huge demand, and I believe they will also raise prices to meet that demand, and most people will have no choice but to accept it in order to hold onto their furniture and belongings that they have nowhere to put. 

The housing market moves slow. Please look for the signs. What you are seeing is a bubble, and it is about to pop.

Cheers for your thoughts. It's exactly what I'm looking for.",True_Demon,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvpgzj/dark_dd_and_possible_profit_in_the_face_of/gpez899/,0.029,0.9,0.071,0.9568

Almost all of large scale cloud based tech has seen increase in subscriptions, server usage and renewals. Amazon and Apple had their largest revenue quarters in history. This is just a quick example of your fallacy of ""no one can point to any company doing anything"".

Lower interest rates = lower income and limited liquidity? Maybe for banks the income portion is true but I'd want to see the math on that for the average consumer.

GME is a terrible example of option pricing due to extreme volatility and not at all indicative of the larger market.

2275,RKT," It's a double-edged sword. RKT is a rockstar at the moment and might be coming into their own but the prime rate is on the rise and I would guess that the majority of refis are already done and gone.

u/True_Demon is right, contradicting some of what I've said. If a housing crisis is attenuates, RKT and others will still be making money.... until they don't. I plan on making my investing decisions to prepare, at least in part, for the worst case scenario.",we-are-all-monsters,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvpgzj/dark_dd_and_possible_profit_in_the_face_of/gpdu9x5/,0.158,0.842,0.0,-0.9455
2276,RKT," I would say that as a mortgage company, they might have a lot of business in a situation leading to a housing crisis, like in 2008, but when it comes to foreclosures, I don't think they make money off that. That's a lender/borrower thing.
A lot of things contributed to the 2008 crash. In my own personal story, my wife and I refi'd our house in 2006 with an ARM loan. Once shit hit the fan in 2008, our lender decided to up the interest to the top, instead of the promised gradual increase. In the years leading up to the crisis, there was a lot of predatory lending in that market, where people were being shoehorned into home loans that they shouldn't have been.
From what I've read, once there was a slew of defaults on loans, the banks lost a ton of money. Since our economy depends on those loans, millions of them, once a large chunk were suddenly gone, so was a lot of capital for the banks. Banks go down, markets go down. You could argue that the house lending industry could be the backbone of the economy. Too much growth without the funds to sustain it, the bubble popped.

OP's post is a great warning. We might be coming into a bull market now but with the special circumstances of the covid, and people's inability to keep their loans, we're set up for a failure, too. We can gush about meme stocks all day but the wise investor invests in defensive stocks and mutual funds. His non-investing advice was to have fun but keep your ear to the ground. If you see a lot of Uhauls in your area, it might be a good idea to take an afternoon to see how your local housing market is doing.

As for RKT going up, I don't know. I eat crayons with the rest of you. My guess, as ignorant as it is, would be that it'll go up for a bit, then correct into its proper price range.

ex div date = 3/9 so you have to own the stock by 3/5 to get divy. yes you are correct with the 3/5. the stock price will adjust by the amount of dividend.

keep it mind this is not a normal dividend like most stocks. light DD below

it's a **special dividend** (google it), most special divies are classified as **return on capital** to free up its balance sheet. I personally believe this is the case for RKT, which means your cost basis is lowered and generally non-taxable, only your gains when you sell is taxable.

so if you bought the stock at $21, new cost basis is now $21 - $1.11 = $19.89 

special dividend are good for long term investors (like myself). Some key points (out of many) 

1. Special dividend **lowers my cost**
2. Delays immediate **taxes** (normie dividends I would've paid taxes next year)
3. RKT announced a $1bill **buyback** (this did not get executed yet) but this will further drive up stock price
4. **Retention rate** for customers 2020 90+% 
5. Higher **gain of sale** Y-o-Y
6. People are scared of **higher interest rates and lower refinancing**, let me say this higher rates will shake out competitors and RKT will pick up market share. What this means is RKT will get so big, interest rates fluctuating won't budge its business in the long run. This is very simple, **people buy homes when they have money they don't stay in their moms basement and wait for dipping interest rates.**

Long RKT until the company proves me wrong otherwise. There's so many upsides with this.

2443,IMO," To be honest I might not even sell at $500-$600. IMO that's still undervalued for the potential the company has and with the demand from hedgies and bears to cover their shorts I feel like $600 is still a bit of a lowball.

Even though their business model is antiquated with the gains they've had even at the low point recently it was far above what it was last year and stabilized at around $50 for some time.

If they do the smart thing, take their capital gains from this year, restructure their business model to fit the changes in the industry along with the announcement of new pokemon games this year which should boost their sales considerably I feel like holding their stock over the next couple of years would actually be a smart play.

If Gamestop plays their cards right they could absolutely rise to the top of the gaming industry. In my uneducated opinion what I would do in their shoes is focus on their strong points they have already. Brick and mortar stores are dying especially ones that sell physical media.  

With the big rise in digital game sales physical copies are not nearly as lucrative as they once were. They need to focus on what still keeps them solvent and I think a smart play would be to develop their own streaming platform for games.

Imagine this. You go to Gamestop, you buy the ""Gamestop Box"" , connect it to your TV and internet and you launch the app that connects to their platform, you grab your controller and you play games from different consoles. Imagine Netflix's business model applied to video games! I'm not sure how the legality would work but if they could figure out how to do that without violating copyrights or other regulations it could easily put them at the top of the industry.

2464,GME," I'm completely retarded and don't know what I'm talking about, but Fundamental and Technical Analysis are looking at stock as a reflection of financial metrics and market metrics respectively.

Within those analyses, particularly Fundamentals, Value investors are looking at the current health of the company, Growth investors are looking for future growth and innovation.

$120 (8.4 Billion Market Cap) might be an accurate analysis as a value investor.  But a growth investor might argue that this isn't a fair or accurate analysis of potential growth.

Let's look at 2019 as that's easier data for us to access.

US gaming industry revenue was $60.59 Billion [https://www.statista.com/statistics/246892/value-of-the-video-game-market-in-the-us/#:\~:text=This%20timeline%20presents%20a%20forecast,worth%2060.4%20billion%20U.S.%20dollars](https://www.statista.com/statistics/246892/value-of-the-video-game-market-in-the-us/#:~:text=This%20timeline%20presents%20a%20forecast,worth%2060.4%20billion%20U.S.%20dollars).

Microsoft's revenue from gaming (Microsoft published games, XBOX etc) was $20,719,000,000  [https://www.statista.com/statistics/831590/microsoft-quarterly-gaming-revenue/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/831590/microsoft-quarterly-gaming-revenue/)

Sony's revenue from gaming was $18.9 Billion. [https://www.statista.com/statistics/297533/sony-sales-worldwide-by-business-segment/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/297533/sony-sales-worldwide-by-business-segment/)

GME revenue in 2019 was $8,285,000,000 (not broken down into gaming) [https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/revenue](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/revenue)

Reports show that GME has revenue sharing of 10% with both Microsoft and Sony.

(Sony confirmation is with Seaking Alfa (not sure if I can share their links)

[https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/?source=content\_type%3Areact%7Cfirst\_level\_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain\_content%7Cbutton%3Abody\_link](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)

So let's say that's not factored in and this is 10% of all Microsoft and Sony US revenues.

That should be at least a couple of extra billion of revenue for GME.  A 20% increase in revenue is already possible, but potentially much more if the new directors can help progress this into a strong digital business with brick and mortar product support, PC hardware and social gaming strongholds post-covid.

The Price to Sales Ratio of GME during the big short of 2020 was 0.05.

When the ps4 released it was all the way up to 0.53.  After the ps3 released it was at 0.99.

So if we use P/S ratio to guide our valuation, and use growth investor valuation, would GME be worth 8.4B?  
8.4B is at a 1.4 P/S ratio based on data that's a quarter behind.  I think that their revenue will go up, their outgoings will go down and their market share will go up too.

I think we're likely to settle at $150 after the mania settles down, but if it stays well above that I think the consensus will match shareholder expectations as GME doubles down on reinventing and restructuring their business model in line with the future of gaming.

1- Ryan Cohen is really seen as a big turn-around if he become CEO, so people/HF buy it in masse.

2- The short-sell did not cover and are scare of Ryan Cohen being CEO, so the covered? At least some of them.

And i think Market cap  and their revenue ( not profit ) are close?  Like 6b vs 8b market cap.  It's good?

Or like they are WAY out of the normal price ?  But the price is that high, because of the Short % ? ( making share ""rarer"", so more valuable for shorty peep? )

2633,DD," Hey everyone. I can't speak to the OPs authenticity, but his sentiments echo similar sentiments over the past few weeks. It's these previous sentiments that inspired my recent $218 speculation.

I bought 2 contracts last Friday $23C 3/5 $1.09.

I sold 1 contract for $635 about 45 minutes ago.

I'm going to give my other contract another day or so to roam free, before I sell it too.

I started small and through other people's DD I made a decision. I'm learning the process necessary in spotting value and opportunity. I'm no financial advisor and this isn't advice.",hereforlonghaul,25,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw4qgb/rkt_massive_squeeze_setup/gpfgx2o/,0.027,0.818,0.155,0.9342

With the IV shooting up it doesn't seem nearly as lucrative as last week. You say your still looking to add calls, what still tickles your fancy on the call chain?
