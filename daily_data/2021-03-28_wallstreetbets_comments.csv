0,SO," As someone whose child spent some time in a children’s hospital while ill, THANK YOU. Seriously, thank you to anyone who is doing this. This is going to mean SO much to those kids, many whom can’t get out of bed while they are there. It’s so hard to keep a little one quiet, in bed and calm while they are in the hospital. You guys are amazing!!",MrsG293,81,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mf0msr/gamestop_gear_going_to_the_new_home_at_the/gskwtht/,0.082,0.759,0.16,0.7936
1,GME," These are piling up on me and literally making me cry, I can barely see what I'm typing😭 between these kinda posts helping these poor kids and helping the apes and other endangered animals im so fking flustered. 

THIS COMMUNITY IS SO WHOLESOME!! 

Who knew a bunch of fellow smooth brained apes could do so much good in the world! 🥲 I put every spare penny I have into GME but after it hits the next galaxy cluster and Melvin and shitadel are living in boxes yelling at stop signs on wall street, or once I start seeing significant unrealized gains yall can bet I'll be following in the footsteps of the apes before me. Those whomst blazed the trail of making an impact because lambos are great, but making the world a better place one ape a time is how we can truly die happy knowing we use our wealth for good unlike the leeches on Wall Street. 

I cant donate much rn but ill be picking up trash on the beach weekly so I can hop on this helping train w my tiny contribution. It ain't much, but it'll be honest work. thank you guys for the inspiration. Ape together strong 🥲

2,TV," When I was a YOUNG child, I had to stay in the hospital to get surgery and observation and some tests they told me because I had skin cancer. EVERYTHING about the stay was absolutely terrifying and awful. Everything except one awesome memory. I remember them wheeling in a TV and a N64. I had IV's in and I couldn't even play without making myself feel sick. I remember teaching both my mom and a nurse how to play mario and telling them one step at a time what to do and each of them beating their first ever levels in Mario. I remember it so fondly I'm tearing up now thinking about it. All the memes aside this will make MANY childrens' days and stays much better. I remember the feeling of getting to ""play"" that game in the middle of all the awful more clearly than I remember all the awful now. It has been a long time since then and I am STILL very thankful for the person whoever they were that donated the system to the hospital. I know it was donated because I've been back there and gone through the same office to donate myself. Anyone that does something like this for children in need gets instant great karma in my eyes.

10,DVD," Had to take both my kids to Choa when they were around 1 month old. They both some some kind of stomach bug and kept spitting up and having diarrhea, which is incredibly dangerous at that age since you can't really give them water, so they had to be hooked up to an IV and we couldn't leave the hospital until they were able to keep a certain amount of formula down over consecutive feedings.

The staff there is beyond amazing, whatever their hiring process is, they really know how to pick the people that truly care about working with and helping children. On top of that, the entire hospital is so cool. They have a DVD and book library with options for kids and adults, a bomb-ass dining area with actual good food, play areas for kids, and beautiful gardens and statues outside for you to walk around in.

Once all that is done open a “margin” account on fidelity or TD Ameritrade (easy interface, perfect for beginners).   Robinhood offers immediate 100% leverage but they’re assholes so don’t even talk to them unless it’s to tell Vlad he’s a crook simp bitch with a stupid haircut. 

If done correctly and under the strict advice of an online gambling forum, you should have anywhere from $5,000 to $50,000 in “dry powder” to begin day trading.  

Beginners should start with iron condors, butterflies and selling naked calls to get a handle on market movements.   Do these for 3-4 days, a week at tops, that should get you ready for day trading TQQQ and Tesla with your entire account.

191,BB," Mobileye REM is mapping software to facilitate autonomous driving. IVY turns any car into one big data source that can be read over the air. Esentially, IVY provides data of all sensors for car manufactures and Mobileye only focuses on autonomous driving, and, more importantly, keeps this data for itself. They have completely different purposes and thus could be used together. 

For example: A car manufacturer could use mobileye for autonomous driving and harvest the data on fuel consumption through IVY, then run some diagnostics on it and subsequently provide a new update to the car's OS that provide more efficient fuel consumption

edit:
App developers or car manufactures could setup their own autonomous driving software platform with data provided by IVY though.

208,BB," Don't underestimate the power of abstraction. There is a reason why we're all programming in high lvl programming languages. Most sensor data is now in proprietary format which car manufactures don't want to share with third parties because security reasons. In turn, third parties don't want data streams that deliver data in different formats. And all devs (first and third party) prefer an SDK over interpreting raw data. BB already failed as a phone company when they couldn't get devs on their side to make them apps for their appstore. It was just way easier to develop for iOS then for BB. They're not gonna let that happen again. 

But you could be right though. There should be a real incentive for car manufactures to deliver data to 3rd parties. If there won't be, they will probably remain using their in-house software. OP, however, says  that IVY will be the data bridge between car manufacturers and third party autonomous driving software companies. I'd say that is a possibility, since car companies are utterly shit when it comes to software.  If that remains the case, then there is a good incentive for them to use a third party for their autonomous driving.

210,API," There have been companies like $ROOT that are delivering insurance based on individual driver's performance. Of course, these companies benefit from receiving (real-time) sensor data. However, IVY does not control or own vehicle data, the car manufacturer does. Insurance companies thus must request access to data from each individual automotive company, and there are a lot of automotive companies. Besides, not all automotive companies will be using IVY, so there will be lots of different APIs, each delivering data in a different format. 

I think if vehicle and sensor data will disrupt insurance, it will not be through IVY. It will be a company that has permission to access all car manufacturer's vehicle data and build a data transfer network by connecting to all API endpoints of all automotive data platforms (IVY and its competitors) and provding all data through an unified vehicle data API.

I’ve watched every panel about the future of IVY from BB Execs, and they are purposefully being vague about everything. One thing I liked a lot though was that after they announced their plan for IVY, they mentioned there was a significant number of OEM’s showed a ton of interest with one OEM asking for a workshop on how IVY is planned, prior to xmas 2020.

Considering how they dominate their market in 19/25 of the major EV producers, I think IVY could be MASSIVE. Obviously nothing is set in stone, but I really think there’s some deep fuckin value here.

288,OR," Yes, basically. In theory. Remember the shorts are able to artificially increase supply though which allows them to dilute the shares. If they cannot drive the price down enough(using whatever means they can, even illegal/unethical) then they end up making the problem worse. Shorters lose when the price goes up. When people come in to buy the price guys up(demand)... shorters do not actually increase supply though except through FUD. What happens if people don't fall for their bluff.

&#x200B;

E.g., No different than in poker with a guy with a pair of 2's and goes all in trying to bluff and gets called on it and loses everything. That is what has happened unless the shorters can somehow fabricate enough FUD to drive people out, but if you know they are bluffing then how will they drive you out? (now, if people start selling to take profit they end up helping the shorts and that could end up creating a problem, but if there are enough buyers they will just come in and buy up the stock knowing they are going to bank in the end).

It all comes down to how long the shorters can keep this up vs the buyers. If the shorters have more money they can keep playing this came and eventually drive the price down enough to either cover(possibly at a loss but not terrible but they probably hedged enough to make a profit) OR the buyers have enough money to keep buying the shorts bullshit and once the shorts can't continue the stock will moon and all the money the shorts put in is now taken by the buyers.

289,GME," The GME situation sounds more like a IV situation. The IV on GME options changes drastically on just single dollar moves so hearing a call fluctuate from $900 to $2.5K sounds about right honestly.

456,UWMC," A few thoughts on volatility drivers for UWMC...

ER is estimated to be in the last week of April. 

June should be the next dividend, which should bring some volume from the dividend hunters, especially if it is near it's current price or lower.

Biden Administration gets the mortgage down payment subsidization into action(or just announced it)

Pissing match with Quicken intensifies (real crapshoot on how this effects the stock)

I think there's likely a good play on call options in here. I'd favor the June options, myself unless I was just trying to make a quick buck. If you think it's about to start a reversal of it's downward trend, then any near or ITM should be profitable as long as you cash out quickly. Holding shorter dated options longer could result in a theta and IV crush if it trades sideways for a week. If it trades sideways for the week, the prices will come down with IV and give a better entry point for OTM calls.",Alphawog,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/menq26/uwmc_my_avg_cost_high_or_its_good/gskgntu/,0.038,0.882,0.08,0.8074
457,CC," That's a pretty sweet entry point. If you're getting cold feet on it, I bet you can sell for a small profit at some point on Monday. Of course with that cost basis, the annual dividend alone will be a 5% return and if you start selling the monthly $9 CC on it you might get another 3% return each month (assuming it stays in this range). That would net you a 41% return in total for a year of ownership. And if that CC gets assigned at some point it's close to a 15% return at that point(so almost 18% return total in 1 month). 

I know it's not as sexy as a 10 bagger, but outperforming the index consistently is still a win. There are a ton of ways to play that entry point for profit from where the market currently is. You could even sell a long deep in the money call if you wanted reduce your potential for loss and just ride the dividend until it get's assigned.",Alphawog,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/menq26/uwmc_my_avg_cost_high_or_its_good/gskei8i/,0.036,0.859,0.104,0.9163
458,SI," Many of you might remember that beautiful gamma ramp from 3/16. While that ended up closer to cardboard box status than valhalla, this earnings is shaping up to be something special.

Someone has shorted themselves down to an estimated SI cost basis of 14.73. Earnings have every potential to be unexpectedly amazing and cause a massive pop. There is an Ortex estimated 20mil shares SI, and 13 of that was in the last two weeks. If this was just earnings we'd be looking at some excellent gains. If earnings is good, these shorts are going to have to cover and it will get **ugly.**

But the reality is its shipped in a tractor trailer full of about 1500 pieces, everything from generators to mattresses to boflex weight equipment. Sometimes we're lucky and our packages are on the top of the pile, sometimes, not so lucky and its on the bottom. Thats why we insure all of our packages. Im not sure how FedEx does things but all of our packages at UPS are insured so I guess thats one upside. And if our drivers ever threw packages in the trash because they didnt feel like delivering them they wouldnt have a job anymore lol.

UWMC's Market Cap is 12.81 billion USD at a price point point of 7.93. 12.81/11.493= 1.114. So the website is slightly wrong. Probably because it took it from when it was even lower.

UWMC has a dividend of 5.04%, whereas PFSI has one of of .96%.

PFSI had net income of 1.65B in 2020, whereas UWMC had net income of $1.37B in Q4 2020 alone, and a FY Net Income of $3.38B.

Let me be clear that the analyst estimate hasn't been updated when they state a P/E for UWMC of 1.27 dollars per share. It's more likely to be 2.42, for a forward P/E of 3.29. I can't be assed to find the P/E ration by manually counting it right now. Just divide the shares by the net income later.

521,PFSI," you do realize the book value used for P/B calculations is equity = assets - liabilities right? Here you only list the assets, but fail to account for the liabilities. The actual equity listed in UWMC's 10-K is $5B, and 12.98 / 5 \~ 2.6. The numbers before were wrong because UWMC went public with a SPAC merger and that fks up the numbers.

What's your point regarding the net income? Sure UWMC is a larger company, but its ratio is worse than PFSI.

Also, you got a source for the $2.42 EPS number? Consensus EPS for 2021 is $1.32. If you think they will beat it, what make you think PFSI won't also beat it?

525,PFSI," PFSI's service UPB is $200B vs RKT's $400B, I couldn't find UWMC's breakdown in their 10-K. So you are right in that by percentage PFSI does more servicing than RKT. The total delinquency amount rate is 12% up from 7% in 2019, and for RKT it's 4% from 1% in 2019 (RKT pride themselves in servicing good credit mortgages though, they even show in their 10-k that their average credit score is in the mid 700s), so there is increased risk but not a ton from before. With covid forbearance, most of the increased delinquencies should end up ok as employment ramping up, but because this is unprecedented so it's yet to be seen how it will turn out. 

Like I said in the post, interest rates won't go up significantly until after 2023. With PFSI having these ratios, I think I would be confident buying for next few quarters at least.",CMScientist,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mer3er/move_over_uwmc_pfsi_is_the_most_undervalued_large/gsk4s7s/,0.009,0.83,0.161,0.9712

527,PFSI," It's actually market price per share/book value per share for price to book ratio. Regardless, i know what you're referring to, but you've miscalculated it. The price for UWMC isn't 12.98, by the way, it's 7.97. 

As for the SPAC, I would hope so, as it gave the company 925 million dollars. 425 Million, and a further 500 million in PIPE.

As for the 10-K, it's fucked because it's the GORE SPAC. You can see the 425 million number I've mentioned. The better form to look at is Q4 2020, as it also does the full year. From their investor relations.

I hope this clears things up.

As for consensus EPS.
