66,VERY," Prices have followed construction costs up. This is normal and not a sign of a problem in my opinion. 

Inflation is VERY good for mortgaged homeowners. Fixed rate debt is bad for the lender since the dollars used to pay down the debt in future years are worth less in real terms. It is even better for the borrower if the debt is secured by an asset that rises with inflation - like real estate.",mrmrmrj,30,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ojw4sq/why_the_housing_market_is_likely_fucked/h55doko/,0.136,0.659,0.205,0.7418
67,DD," 10 Trillion in housing debt just happened to be the high point in 2008. It doesn’t mean it is the cap on housing debt. People who have purchased in the last 3 years are in a fantastic position (Maybe not so much those who purchased at super inflated prices over the last 6 months). Low interest rates mean lower monthly payment and less chance of default. I could quit my job and work at mcdicks and still easily make my monthly mortgage payment. (Would I be approved for a new loan on that lower salary? No, but that’s beside the point).

The more worrisome issue is the rise of all other debt. Housing debt at least comes with a tangible asset, while most other debt (credit cards, car loans, student loans, doctor bills, etc) are all liabilities through and through.  These are also the first things that people stop paying when they get into a bad situation. 

There’s no doubt in my mind that the housing market is nearing a top, but we aren’t looking at a 2008 like crisis right now.  I like where your heads at though.  I think this has potential to boil over in a few years, and if you keep following it closely you might be in position to make some money.  Also really appreciate all the insight and great articles. really interesting information. Great DD",aputhehindu,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ojw4sq/why_the_housing_market_is_likely_fucked/h55g0i6/,0.163,0.68,0.157,0.0743
68,ARE," Disagree with your analysis.

1) True debt is at ATH, but this is somewhat negated by points #4 and #7.

2) Physical lumber prices ARE going down.  I'm in the process of doing major renovations and paused for 60 days waiting on the spike to end.  Just put the order in with our contractor to resume.

3) Unemployment is still up, but the labor market is tight. Wages are rising (see point #4).

4) As long as the economy is inflated from the lower income brackets, this is fine. And this appears to be where the new money is going (see point #3).

5) Yes starts are double now and near ATH, but inventory is currently at ATL.  At the current completion rate/sale rate ratio it will take roughly 3 years to restore inventory levels to a neutral market that isn't tilted to either the buyer or seller.

6) Lenders and appraisers are being much more cautious since 2008.  Overall, buyers are better qualified and required to pay more down while appraisals are coming in at or under sale prices forcing buyers to pony up even more cash to close or kill the deal.

7) Your one saving grace. I doubt we see negative interest rates. I'm expecting them to stay low for about another year before climbing again. This should cool the market. Maybe.

1) True debt is at ATH, but this is somewhat negated by points #4 and #7.

2) Physical lumber prices ARE going down.  I'm in the process of doing major renovations and paused for 60 days waiting on the spike to end.  Just put the order in with our contractor to resume.

3) Unemployment is still up, but the labor market is tight. Wages are rising (see point #4).

4) As long as the economy is inflated from the lower income brackets, this is fine. And this appears to be where the new money is going (see point #3).

5) Yes starts are double now and near ATH, but inventory is currently at ATL.  At the current completion rate/sale rate ratio it will take roughly 3 years to restore inventory levels to a neutral market that isn't tilted to either the buyer or seller.

6) Lenders and appraisers are being much more cautious since 2008.  Overall, buyers are better qualified and required to pay more down while appraisals are coming in at or under sale prices forcing buyers to pony up even more cash to close or kill the deal.

7) Your one saving grace. I doubt we see negative interest rates. I'm expecting them to stay low for about another year before climbing again. This should cool the market. Maybe.

There is a massive housing shortage right now, meaning houses are being bought to the individual who is financially able to purchase homes for above asking prices.

In fact, across the board, my industry is having a very hard time sourcing lumber and prices are high. There is nothing artificial about the current lumber issue/situation in my industry. Homeowners are still spending large amounts of money to remodel homes. When covid hit March of last year we expected a 30% decrease in business but we’ve seen a 30-35% increase and still climbing. Most large construction plants/companies furloughed in anticipation of this incorrectly perceived decrease and  have been struggling ever since to rehire and keep up with demand. If it normally takes 4-6 weeks to get, let’s say, cabinets…it now takes roughly 10-16 weeks to receive them but we are still setting monthly sales records.

1 - eviction and foreclosure moratoriums have taken some housing supply off the market. As a result, not only prices but also rents have been pushed higher. The moratoriums will eventually lift and that supply will start trickling back into the market.

75,LTC," Supply is artificially low because of a few factors, IMO;

Eviction/foreclosure moratoriums nationwide, plus additional protections from the CFPB. These will eventually hit the market. Especially, homeowners who have spent the last 14 months or so in forbearance. 

Reluctance to move elderly homeowners into LTC/nursing home facilities during the pandemic. This should abate as well, contributing to additional homes for sale.

So as long as the job market doesn’t collapse, that shouldn’t necessarily crash the housing market. I also think people shouldn’t avoid buying a home right now if they can afford it (just don’t overpay). Even on just a 10 year timeline I think prices will rebound after a crash. 

I do think it’s coming though. I bought my house in 2019, and the value skyrocketed this year, and now it’s back down to about what we paid for it.

296,DD," It's more of a ""my opinion"" write up rather than a DD. On inflation I think you're missing a critical point. Once wages rise it's very difficult to drive them back down. When someone is used to earning $18/hr they won't take a job for $15/hr easily, for example. Employers will be stuck paying higher wages and will increase prices to maintain their profit margin. Customers who on large are getting paid more now anyway will simply pay the higher prices. e.g. persistent inflation.

In addition rents are increasing which also contributes to sticky inflation as most contracts are for 1-2 years.

In a way inflation is driving the housing price increase as over paying now but locking in a price in an inflationary environment when combined with cheap mortgages is a strong incentive.

IMHO at some point rates will go up, mortgages will become more expensive, and housing will experience a strong correction, but not a 2008 style crash.",terrybmw335,26,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ok4ndx/dd_why_the_housing_market_isnt_going_to_crash/h56fm4l/,0.047,0.821,0.132,0.9445

666,BB," Hey, no worries - a civilized discussion is always a good thing. :)

I really think the settlement is priced in at its median expected value: it'd have to be remarkably big to move the price, since everyone already knows it's coming. (Otherwise it never would've gone up above $10 to begin with.)

AWS Ivy revenues won't come in until late 2022 or even 2023, since the actual rollout hasn't even begun yet haha. There are lots of deals from EV automakers, yes, but the only thing that matters is the revenue. As Chen said himself (multiple times...), his sales people suck lol. At some point, Ivy will make BB a $30 stock, but that won't happen this year.

As for the recent downfall, you need to zoom out just a bit: the only reason, the only catalyst for BB's spike from $8 to $20 in June was some CNBC guest and his 10-second-long pump - he said he had BB calls, and a ton of boomers rushed to buy. (I believe there'd been a lot of naked shorting on the Canadian stock market, which fueled the squeeze.) There wasn't any actual big news that fed that rally. What we're seeing right now is the reversion to the mean. :(

All that said, I'm holding some BB at $12 and will keep swing-trading every time it pops haha. I got trapped at $17 in January, averaged down to $10, and then doubled my money by selling in June. ;) If it goes down to $9 and I have some more cash lying around (the portfolio is a bit red right now hahaha), I'll average down.

Spotgamma Market Analysis - \*""The Unclenching Of Gamma May Unleash The Overbought Stock Market""\*

""\*Since the big June options expiration, US equity markets have run sharply higher. Starting on June 18, the S&P 500 has gained an unexpected 5%. The move higher has come despite many economic reports suggesting the economy may have hit peak growth rates, coupled with a Fed that may grow more hawkish in the second half of 2021. However, the tranquility and flight higher for stocks may be about to end.""\*  
\*""The recent run-up has pushed many key indexes and ETF’s, such as the NASDAQ 100 (QQQ), well into overbought territory. Meanwhile, leadership within the equity market has narrowed, meaning fewer stocks are pushing the market higher. However, come Friday, the equity market will see gamma positions built up over the past month, helping to drive the market higher, melt away. So, the S&P 500 will lose that big center of gamma gravity which has helped keep the index anchored around 4,350 to 4,400 since July 2.""\*

Chart #1 Here:  [https://imgur.com/gallery/gFkenLg](https://imgur.com/gallery/gFkenLg)

\*""Once the index loses the gamma levels centered around the 4350 to 4400 range, it will allow the markets to move more freely, thus creating greater volatility. Considering how overbought some parts of the market are, like the QQQ ETF, once volatility increases, it could result in a sharp move lower for the entire equity market. The QQQ has a relative strength index of over 75 and was recently as high as 77.25 on July 7. An RSI at this level suggests that the ETF is extremely overbought. Since 2015 the RSI of the QQQ ETF has only exceeded 77 roughly six other times, with four of those times resulting in the ETF falling by 10% or more in the days and weeks that followed.""\*  


Chart #2 Here:  [https://imgur.com/gallery/Vi7AUnl](https://imgur.com/gallery/Vi7AUnl)

\*""Additionally, the falling participation rate of stocks appears to suggest only a handful of companies are partaking in the recent rally. For example, the percentage of stocks above their 50-day moving average in the S&P 500 has declined since peaking in mid-April, despite the S&P 500 reaching record highs. In the past, the declines in the percentage of stocks above their 50-day moving average have at times signaled a turning point in the index preceding pull-backs.""\*

Chart #3 Here:  [https://imgur.com/gallery/vjeP3sO](https://imgur.com/gallery/vjeP3sO)

\*""What’s been driving the move higher appears to be centered around expectations that earnings will be strong, which will usher in another round of upward earnings revisions. During periods of positive earnings revisions, the S&P 500 runs up, but when that growth rate flattens, the S&P 500 goes through a period of heightened volatility. That’s what makes this most recent move higher so vulnerable because the current pace of revisions is slowing, after peaking in May, and is diverging from the S&P 500’s recent advance.""\*

Chart #4 Here:  [https://imgur.com/gallery/M81mCTY](https://imgur.com/gallery/M81mCTY)

\*""All of this makes the timing of the July options expiration perhaps more crucial than usual. For now, the S&P 500, and the entire equity market, has been pinned at these upper levels due to the positioning of the options market. That means this Friday and especially next week could be a very eventful one for the overall market and potentially painful.""\*

998,SPCE," Most countries consider Karman line as the official ""space"".

I know, most of you won't know what is the difference. They're just 20 more km, right?
Wrong.
There is a very easy and very strange measurement unit used in spaceflight. Delta V. It measures basically how ""far"" can you go.

Spaceshiptwo has around 1,1km/s of delta V.

To reach the famous Karman line, you need at least 1,4 km/s. So these last 20 km, require almost 30% more deltaV.

Now, just to put some more numbers in comparisons.

New Shepard (Bezos toy)has a deltaV of 3,3km/s. Basically 3 times the Spaceshiptwo's. 

And those are nothing more than entry level launchers.
We are still talking about ""suborbital flight"". (Flight that don't make a complete orbit around the planet)

Orbital flight requires A LOT more deltaV.

Just to reach the ISS (which is really close to the surface -300km orbit) you need around 9,4km/s of delta V.

Once you reach orbit, things get easier. Not much, but enough.

Saturn V+ apollo stack (what was used to get on the moon and back) had around 12,5km/s.

And then you look at SPCE and all risk factors are magnitudes higher, and so is the cost. Plus the nature of space travel is there are always delays, and it's still subject to weather, so the whole high speed thing may not even materialize.

That's not taking into account, billions worth of launch infrastructure, certification, and design for new aircraft, because the current iteration is not capable of it. For what? So a bunch of rich dudes may or may not use it? Because it's still won't be practical after all that.

1. They made the first practical EV called EV1 in 1996. GM destroyed all EV1 in 2000s because they didnt want EV to cannibalize their ICE vehicle sale. (Who killed Electric cars?)
2. GM's business model is to sell cars $2k - 3k cheaper than Toyota but costing owners 10x more repairs. GM's parts and cheap and widely available, because it is their business model!
3. GM and other legacy automakers did minimal green energy vehicles until Tesla came. They would make EVs at a loss with no marketing just to fulfill their government quota. 

Note: legacy automakers LOVE hybrid because it is so complex and has twice as many parts (EV + ICE powertrain) they can make money servicing exclusively at their dealership.

4.  US regulators love to put foreign competitor like Toyota under microscope whenever some defects come out like sudden acceleration.
