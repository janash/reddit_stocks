52,USA," well then here you go!  

**DD**

**Core Product**

High Tide is Canada’s largest cannabis retailer. The company was founded in 2018 when Canada legalized cannabis. They are a pure-play retailer which allows them to bypass the Ontario govt’s limit on vertical integration.

They are one of the two front-runners in the Canadian cannabis retail industry. The company just completed Its merger with Meta Growth, to become the largest cannabis retailer in Canada. They also own Grasscity which is an Amsterdam-based global e-commerce site for smoking and cannabis consumption accessories.

**Financials**

High Tide currently has a market cap of around $400MM. Their revenue increased by 166% to $83M and gross profit increased by 112% to $8.7M for the year ended on Oct’20. This is not including any contribution from their merger with Meta Growth. The company overall is still in a loss as expected for a high growth startup with a net loss of $5M for the year ended on Oct’20 (compared to $21M loss in 2019).

Their revenue stream as expected is heavily biased towards Canada (82%), with the US contributing 18% and the rest of 1% coming from international markets. Over 50% of the retail revenue for the company came from their Cabana Club members (High Tide’s membership/loyalty program)

The company has a strong cash position of $38M as of Mar’21 which will give them a long runway to execute its growth plans. Their expected revenue for Q1’21 is $37-38M.

**Potential and Hype Factors**

**Store Expansion:** The company is investing heavily into store expansion and expects to have more than 115 stores by the end of 2021 which should significantly drive revenue growth and margin expansion.

**Increasing Cannabis Consumption:** Canada has witnessed an explosive growth in retail sales of adult recreation cannabis. The retail sales increased from $125M in October 2019 to $270M today, \~110% increase YoY.

**Nasdaq Listing:** The company has submitted its application to list on the Nasdaq stock market which would significantly add to the liquidity of the stock and also enable trading the stock in major platforms.

**Further deregulation/legalization in USA:** Any further deregulation or legalization of cannabis in USA would be extremely beneficial to High Tide as they are the largest player in Canada and can effectively leverage their existing position.

**Risk and Competition**

Currently, the biggest risk to High Tide is the barrier to entry within different Canadian provinces. Each Canadian province has a different system for cannabis distribution. For example, the largest market Ontario is currently issuing 30 new licenses per week with no upper limit. There is a possibility that the markets can become overcrowded and the existing margins can erode.

Another risk factor to consider is capital expenditure. High Tide needs to acquire prime real estate for their stores and the company would require continued access to capital to execute their ambitious store expansion strategy. Their competitor Fire & Flower has also announced a significant expansion in the Ontario market. All of this would drive up the High Tide’s capital expense and can significantly affect their margins.

**Conclusion**

The global legal marijuana market is currently valued at $24.6B and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14%. Even though there are significant risks in terms of competition from Fire&Flower and Canada’s licensing system for Cannabis, High Tide currently being the market leader in the Canadian Cannabis industry is poised perfectly to capture the market in the long term and this puts them in a very strong position.

53,FAF," I'm bullish on high tide, but I'm always appreciative of legitimately thought out bear cases.

I dont disagree on the pricing in the next couple months, but I anticipate news of nasdaq uplisting soon will change that significantly. I dont see how this aspect is any better with FAF, considering their consistent downtrend at the moment. I'd say trading semi sideways with a consistent uptrend despite recent market panics is more promising. I'm aware FAF is also pursuing uplisting, but I'm not sure of their timeframe

Where are you getting the data on negative revenue from high tide's retail locations?

I also think you're overlooking HITIs ecommerce business through grasscity and smokecartel, which individually are the largest in the industry. I dont see FAFs Hifyre being competitive in any way.

I read up a bit on the FAF circle k partnership, but I'm not truly convinced of the value here. Best I see is the location market research already done by circle k slightly increasing traffic per new FAF retail location. Otherwise, the businesses are completely separate, circle k is not selling FAF products at their existing locations afaik.",MistrDarp,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/mf10l4/most_discussed_stocks_in_pennystocks_last_week/gsle68h/,0.065,0.793,0.142,0.9523
54,FAF," I'm mostly just upset I didn't get in on it sooner, as for the revenue negative stores, I could have sworn I read an article but can't seem to find it now so I must be mistaken on that.

I do think the runup from 0.25 to 0.80 is speculative and based on perceived future value rather than present fundamentals.
This of course happened with most weed stocks when the US announced intent to legalize federally, but HITI appears to have held onto more of those gains than any of the others.

I do expect it to be worth a couple dollars in a few years, but a big dip at some point before that. I'm hoping to be able to buy in at 0.6 or less

> circle k is not selling FAF products at their existing locations afaik.

They're testing out a program where they put FAF stores next to existing Circle K's, and I'm interested to see if there's a substantial increase of foot traffic for those stores compared to standalone FAF locations.",Asheam,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/mf10l4/most_discussed_stocks_in_pennystocks_last_week/gsls7lt/,0.043,0.832,0.126,0.9343

60,PI," I think it’s a bit of both. Lithium market is soft right now. Seems like it ran a bit too hot in late ‘20/ early ‘21 and profits have been taken and rotated elsewhere, but eventually things will cycle back. In the interim I think the market sentiment is being exacerbated by some abnormally high short volume/open positions in Cyp. Over the last couple months we’ve seen anywhere from 15-30% of daily volume come from short trades and the outstanding short positions continue to increase. I think some of the shorting is from PI Financial - sounds a bit greasy because they did the bought deal but it’s actually fairly normal - google “greenshoe options” and you’ll see they use these over-allotment options to anchor the price a bit. But I think things have gotten a bit away from them and some other parties have jumped in and taken it further. My thinking is they wanted to get into the bought deal but couldn’t. Remember the financing oversubscribed the same day it was announced (A lot of interest in investing) but not everyone got in because cypress didn’t want to raise more money than they needed (they run a lean operation), so I suspect some investors with deep pockets were left on the sidelines. If you were left out and the stock is illiquid and can be manipulated easily why wouldn’t you (and maybe some of your buddies) go out and coordinate a short attack to reduce the price so you can get in for cheap and not pay a premium to everyone else? Of course this is all my theory, I can’t tell who is shorting but it’s being shorted!",GucciEngineer,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/meqcqt/lithium_miner_cypress_development_corp_update_pt3/gskvha1/,0.039,0.871,0.09,0.9125

62,FOR," BETS (OTC:BLITF) is the real deal! Just announced an 8 year multi-BILLION dollar deal with a US and worldwide-facing partner. They’re under NDA currently and can’t name the partner but this thing is going to explode. CEO knows he has a cash machine, doesn’t take a salary, and is going to run this stock price as high as possible to sell the company in 24-36 months. Looking at an easy 15X short term, but his minimum to sell is $10/share. I think he’ll be selling for a lot more than that. Growth and attention with this deal which involves 30-40% revenue sharing with casinos, at NO COST FOR US ENTRY, is going to send this thing rocketing when they’re allowed to formally announce... check out the the latest WSR for all the details. I have bought in quite a bit.

65,ACER," Hello all,

To preface if you check my post history you can see I'm heavily invested in this ($33,816.15) to be exact - obligatory not a financial advisor/nor is this advice and do your own research Yada Yada. Just to be upfront and you can begin critical of what I have to say knowing my position. I am also writing this on my phone so apologies in advance for format - I'll try to add links later in edits 

So rlftf - ran in August up to 96 cents off the initial hype for its drug Zyesami (was called rlf-100). Has been bumpy since then. I will cover a variety of recent events after providing some basic information about the drug and company. 

Drug:
-covid treatment with 2 major trials currently running in stage 2b/3
-has shown in open label studies earlier on increase survival rate and reduce respiratory failure 
-28 day data which was released on Feb 9 showed statistically significant 10 day shorter hospital time compared to standard of care treatment. 
-now you'll see a massive falloff in stock price here - this is because survival improvement wasn't statistically significant. In the open label study which had approx 40 people the survival rate wasn't shown to improve at 28 days either - it only appeared at 60 day results. These early findings were reported in November. 

The reason being is that a lot of people relapse and become sick again and in my judgement the Feb 9 drop occurred to a lack of understanding that at 28 days survival rate should not have been expected to improve.

The drug had been tested in the past for erectile dysfunction - which at  face value who cares right? Well that means all the safety data in the world has already been gathered for this drug and the FDAs primary focus when issuing EUAs is 1. May be effective 2. Safety 3. Does not cause the virus to mutate 

1. Ten day confirmed shorter hospital stay which is needed to clear out overburdened ICU's and saves patients for 100k on average in bills. 
2. This is an old drug that mimics a peptide made in our body and is extremely safe with zero severe side effects 
3. Being a peptide this is not a concern - mutation concerns are usually related to anti-virals 

The lead investigator - J. Javitt has brought 7 drugs to FDA approval in his career and has studied at Harvard and led many bio start-ups in the past. 

The company - rlftf currently is trading @.29 and has a total share count of 3.4 billion approximately. Yes - that's a lot of shares and is a negative, but their current market cap sits at 985m. To compare Cydy, another covid play - market cap was sitting at 4.4billion until poor results came in from their trial. 

There are currently no approved therapeutics to treat SEVERE conditioned patients and this could potentially be the first. 

With that in mind you may ask - well vaccines are here covid isn't going to stick around so what's this worth? 

1. The US may be on its way to being mostly vaccinated, but many other countries haven't begun giving out a single vaccine yet. 
2. Google how many people do not plan on getting vaccinated - recent surveys in feb/march show anywhere from 22 percent to 51 percent are not sure, will wait, or will not get it
3. Variants are spreading and there's a lot of them which means more will come. 

Company is expanding:
Rlftf has recently announced that they have manufacturing agreements with ACER, a new formulation for their inhaler study with TFF, and the company neurorx that they are working on the drug with recently agreed with BRPA to come to market via an SPAC. These are all signs that their is a strong belief that this drug works. 


 The 60 day results are being unblinded tomorrow at 8:30 EDT for the intravenous trial for severe condition covid patients. This is the big catalyst -if results are good FDA approval should be a given which would make this the first approved therapeutic for severe covid patients and news outlets should pick up on this.

After that the inhaler trial which is already started as of March 19th for moderate/severe patients is a 28 day study which if the intravenous study is approved this will likely be as well as will have much wider usage - this is the money maker and it is also being studied for other ARDS diseases as well. 

J. Javitt already hinted on his LinkedIn that he has a meeting with the FDA coming up and I expect big things from this company in the next few months starting this week. 



Tldr:
-Covid treatment study results tomorrow at market open for phase 2b/3

-first to be approved for severe condition patients and will get media attention

-will set up inhaler trial for success in covid and other lung conditions
