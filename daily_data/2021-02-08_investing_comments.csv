39,AI," Valuation is high for sure. But x% increase in fundamentals should not linearly equate to increase in stock price, especially for a company working on new tech like tesla.

Just the fact that tesla was able to overcome all those obstacles to get to this point carries a premium. It’s a moat, it’s not easy for new companies to pass it, and more and more tesla improves, bigger the moat becomes. 

It’s like launching a rocket to space, if they need x gallons of fuel for every million miles at the beginning, and they need to to go 5 million miles, they don’t put 5x gallons of fuel. They put something like 3x gallons. The reason is, the more and more rocket is airborne, lesser the drag and takes less fuel.

This stock is like that, further they go, it becomes easier to go the next step. That should be priced into the stock too.

Best example is apple, they have a rock solid moat no one seem to be able to breach. If I get a billion dollars, can I build a better phone than an iPhone? For sure.

62,CEO," >Things will never be priced in Bitcoin if the value of it ~~fluctuates like a stock~~ is extremely volatile.

All fiat currencies fluctuate in value day-to-day, but the biggest currencies are stable, so fluctuation is quite minimal. Until Bitcoin has been stabilized and its transaction fees drastically reduced, I just don't see it being a practical form of payment for anything. Hell, the only reason it is a mostly viable store of value is because of these major players pouring billions into it. 


I do think there are going to be issues in the future considering how much influence China has on the crypto market, particularly with Bitcoin. Last I checked, it is estimated that China controls at least half of the global Bitcoin mining capacity. Seems like a potential problem in my opinion, but I'm not an expert on the intricacies of the crypto markets and how it will be impacted one way or another.

Edit: Just dropping a link to some of the potential problems with China and Bitcoin: https://www.investopedia.com/news/bitcoin-wont-win-worldwide-adoption-because-china-controls-it-ripple-ceo/

72,MARA," Thanks for the explanation. I am understanding it from the transactional side. 

But, then my question is, given that it's effectively useless as a currency, what's the point?

I mean, ok, it's a decentralized network that doesn't rely on traditional banking, but it's really no more or less convenient than traditional banking.

I can charge something on my credit card just as easy (perhaps easier) than using bitcoin.

Sorry for the questions, but I've been trying to figure out some of this stuff because my broker likes to take a small part of our portfolio and invest in some riskier things. We don't invest in actual crypto, but we have, for example, MARA that's up 22% right now.

I will say, he did tip me off to dogecoin as a meme and I threw in $1,000 and made about 150% profit then got out because it's stupid and volatile.

But, it made me start questioning the entire crypto premise, as in, what is the value based on? At least the USD has the backing of the federal government which still has value to it. I can't actually put my finger on why crypto has any value beyond the idea that people think it does; which I suppose you could make the argument that the US gov't is the same.

127,AI, Hardware won't be the deciding factor.  If you mess the hardware up yeah you won't succeed but it's not hard to rig up a car with the proper sensor kit.   The hurdle is being able to build a network that cars upload their data to and being able to organize the data in a useful way.  Then on top of all that you need to have a team working on AI algorithms that can learn from the data you are collecting.  I honestly see no way any major car manufacturer can solve this problem their selves.  It's just so far outside of their talent pool.  I also don't see a tech company coming in like apple and solving the problem either.  That's why I think Tesla is so special.  It's a car company birthed in silicon valley that has the roots of silicon valley tech and car manufacturing.   They have a million cars on the road uploading data to a mature network.  They have AI algorithms that are already working.

160,FSI," tl;dr - I don’t think sumo are in a fair fight with the others, the competition is pretty big and (the competition) are the industry standard

My personal take:
Lets start by splitting the software industry into 3 sectors:
1. Startups (both 8 or 9 figures)
2. Unicorns and big tech companies (Billions valuations +)
3. FSI (financial sector) and Military 

Now you said that managing your own stack is not something that is viable, when in fact group no. 1 HAVE to do it as they probably tight on budget
Most of the times group no2 need a very scalable solution as they are running a MASSIVE infrastructure.
So they might go with the OSS(open source software) version of things - AKA EFK stack (elastic), the pros that its OSS can get you a POC cheaply, and I know it as the de-facto standard of logging   
Group No3 is where the big money is, they implement things slowlier than the rest of the tech industry, use Professional Services to reduce liability in case of breach and overall legal defense.
So they might not use EFK(although i saw some enterprises who still use it)
They might go with sumo, but Splunk got the first product advantage, as they are already implemented in most FSi enterprises with Datadog
Migrating to another costs millions if your infra is up and running, so i dont see them do it in the near future. As you need a really good added value to make an old, not so innovative companies (FSI+Military are very chunky orgs most of the time) to change their tools.

Now you said that managing your own stack is not something that is viable, when in fact group no. 1 HAVE to do it as they probably tight on budget
Most of the times group no2 need a very scalable solution as they are running a MASSIVE infrastructure.
So they might go with the OSS(open source software) version of things - AKA EFK stack (elastic), the pros that its OSS can get you a POC cheaply, and I know it as the de-facto standard of logging   
Group No3 is where the big money is, they implement things slowlier than the rest of the tech industry, use Professional Services to reduce liability in case of breach and overall legal defense.
So they might not use EFK(although i saw some enterprises who still use it)
They might go with sumo, but Splunk got the first product advantage, as they are already implemented in most FSi enterprises with Datadog
Migrating to another costs millions if your infra is up and running, so i dont see them do it in the near future. As you need a really good added value to make an old, not so innovative companies (FSI+Military are very chunky orgs most of the time) to change their tools.

162,PS," tl;dr - I don’t think sumo are in a fair fight with the others, the competition is pretty big and (the competition) are the industry standard

My personal take:
Lets start by splitting the software industry into 3 sectors:
1. Startups (both 8 or 9 figures)
2. Unicorns and big tech companies (Billions valuations +)
3. FSI (financial sector) and Military

""Is the observability market still about logging?""


To me, the answer is no. Most teams are moving towards distributed systems and as a result, plain old logging doesnt cut it anymore...the two main features are APM (the ability to see an action across multiple services or layers of your app) and Metrics. 

Sumo is all fine and well for logging but their APM and Metrics offerings are either inadequate or not mature compared to competitors, IMO the market is moving out from underneath them.

I wouldn't call any of these long-term at this point. Perhaps 10 years from now we could evaluate that thesis, but 3-4 years max in an unprecedented liquidity driven market does not really prove much aside from the fact that risky assets seeing the greatest alpha when central banks push investors out the risk curve. 

If the thesis here is ""buy profitless companies that have an interesting story when we see waves of liquidity entering the market"", then you're 100% spot on, or at least that's what the recent history has shown us. 

>A large component of the stock market is based off of psychology and feeling.
 
100%. But this is a method of trading, and once that psychology fades, those stocks tend to mean revert. So unless you're adopting a trading system based on popular pyschology and flows for these types of stocks, It's NOT the type of process you should use for a longer term investing strategy. Ideally, for a long term investing strategy, you would want to find something that works out across different macro regimes / recession periods. As the old adage goes, markets in the short term are a voting machine, but in the long run tend to be weighing machines where true fundamentals actually matter. IE, cashflows, competition, moats, debts, liquidity ratios, etc.  

>You need to find an undervalued stock that actually has a compelling story that the mass public will jump on as well.

Correct, albeit, how are you defining undervalued for any of these? I don't see a single stock mentioned here that would be viewed as undervalued by any value metric. Either way, lets not conflate trading and riding a wave of liquidity amidst somewhat unprecedented risk taking with ""fundamentals"". And that's not even an argument to say that these companies are doing anything wrong. They have generated great sales growth, they have raised capital, and they have grown significantly. But they're all still priced for perfection in a lot of ways. I'm not trying to be stingey here, I've made a buck or two on some of these, but I just hope people understand that a gigantic portion of the success of these companies is more owed to the macro regime that allows for these types of companies to see enormous growth in share price more than anything else. If that macro regime shifts, there is a very real chance that the exact opposite will occur of what happened over the last 3 years.

As for the strategy, this is what worked in the last 1-2 years, which have been extremely unique times. That doeesn't mean it's what ""works"" as a general rule of thumb, and the more that people think this is the norm, the more they're bound to get burned in the long run by learning the wrong lessons.",cbus20122,1,/r/investing/comments/lfc0fa/tired_of_hearing_about_all_these_meme_stocks_i/gmmihap/,0.042,0.825,0.133,0.9938

When then do I exit the trade? When what I thought about the stock in the beginning doesn't apply anymore, AKA the stock doesn't have the value I thought it had before. 

Based on how you asked the question, I feel like you don't actually know why you go in a trade, therefore, you don't know what is the value of your position. Of you know the value, you'll know when it's overvalued, it's that simple. That would be a good place to start.

252,BP," https://www.woodmac.com/news/opinion/which-supermajors-portfolios-are-most-resilient/

Here are some projections done for each of the supermajors for different prices of crude. If you’re expecting crude demand and price to return to 2019 levels, BP is the best value play. If you’re expecting 2014 levels (another oil super cycle from a demand squeeze post-covid after production has been reduced during covid) Exxon, followed by Chevron are the best plays. In the near term, oil is currently trending to return to 2019 demand and price in the near future (within 1 year) making BP seem to be the best oil value play at current valuations, being down the farthest from its high despite having similar writeoffs, earnings and revenue decline as Exxon Mobil.

The reason BP missed last earnings and revenue expectations was because they hedged their oil and natural gas futures by selling them early in the quarter, expecting oil and nat gas to go down. However, there was a Dem sweep leading to big infrastructure spending in 2021, OPEC collaboration lowering global oil supply, as well as effective vaccines finishing testing, and beginning distribution, along with stronger than expected energy and oil demand from China and India. All this together has lead to the recent rally in crude these last two quarters, and should cause all supermajors to raise guidance and beat expectations for Q1 2021. BP is expected to underwhelm the most, so stand to gain the most from this.

Personally loaded a bunch of june/jan 2022 calls thursday and friday last week, along with the 2023 leaps I already had been accumulating.
Similar to OP, I’d be expecting to see BP hit around 28 by June off the back of earnings and revenue beats in their April earnings report and sooner than expected share buybacks and dividend increase, combined with the continued rally of crude off of the world recovering from COVID.

I could see BP being anywhere from 35-60 by the end of 2023, depending on the global political situation surrounding oil (OPEC, sanctions on Iran, war, etc). Overall, a really great investment opportunity where most of the downside risk and negative sentiment is already priced in after the earnings miss last week.",__euphoria____,5,/r/investing/comments/lf02ot/crude_oil_prices_at_highest_level_since/gmj9s8p/,0.093,0.772,0.135,0.9615

In this scenario we see oil rise now, and then pull back in a month, then slowly climb back up. XOM could dip down again. 

I think XOM will go above $60, I'd expect it to end the year somewhere around $55-75.

275,NYT," Yes, your crude price forecast is reasonable (though the Aramco production cuts are through Feb/March, so pullback should be April, all else being equal). However, even if we see the price sustain roughly around this level through 2021 (e.g. if we smooth out the effects of OPEC production increases/demand increases etc.), I would expect to see XOM continue to consolidate throughout the year as they pay down debt, reaffirm the stability of their dividend, and end up nearer to its 2019 level of ~$70.

However, I think there is some potential for a fair bit more upside than this. Many oil minors have been wiped out by the pandemic, and there's been a lot of consolidation in the sector. Meanwhile Capex spending in 2020 was way down even for the majors. Rig counts are still less than half of what they were pre-pandemic. KeystoneXL has been cancelled, increasing the costs of Canadian oil relative to expectations. If pent-up demand for travel comes roaring back post-vaccine, I don't think its out of the question that we might see crude prices in the range we saw through the first half of the 2010s of $70-$100/bbl (I acknowledge OPEC+ will actively be trying to avoid this in order to avoid US shale taking off again, but events could quite easily get ahead of them in the short-medium term).

However, even if we see the price sustain roughly around this level through 2021 (e.g. if we smooth out the effects of OPEC production increases/demand increases etc.), I would expect to see XOM continue to consolidate throughout the year as they pay down debt, reaffirm the stability of their dividend, and end up nearer to its 2019 level of ~$70.

However, I think there is some potential for a fair bit more upside than this. Many oil minors have been wiped out by the pandemic, and there's been a lot of consolidation in the sector. Meanwhile Capex spending in 2020 was way down even for the majors. Rig counts are still less than half of what they were pre-pandemic. KeystoneXL has been cancelled, increasing the costs of Canadian oil relative to expectations. If pent-up demand for travel comes roaring back post-vaccine, I don't think its out of the question that we might see crude prices in the range we saw through the first half of the 2010s of $70-$100/bbl (I acknowledge OPEC+ will actively be trying to avoid this in order to avoid US shale taking off again, but events could quite easily get ahead of them in the short-medium term).

309,GME," So I had some fun with GME, lost some money, but learned a lot about stocks and investing. I've been lazy to actually put savings into investing and have had it depreciate via inflation. However beating the market is no longer a goal and I'm interesting in long term via mutual funds and indexes.

I see the sub recommends Vanguard and I've seen positive talk of $VOO. Is it okay idea to put my excess savings into $VOO and forget about it? (Not really forget about it, just a saying). I understand that $VOO represents many different stocks and it supposedly diversifies for me (I understand $VOO invests in the top 500 companies, has decent overlap. Vanguard claims though for a 10+ year investment the volatility isn't too concerning). However, is there still a chance something like $VOO and Vanguard manages to crash? $VOO has been around for a decade, (2010?) and has seen an average annual gain of 20.7% in those 10 years (Nov 1, 2010 @ $108.18 to Nov 1, 2020 @ 332.64). That sounds amazing enough to me if I am understanding correctly.

If I went with $VOO (because $VOO is just an option/example, feel free to suggest alternatives) would I experience preferential treatment or benefits through a Vanguard account? I set up with TDAmeritrade to exchange stocks.

How would I diversify on top of an index? I've looked at treasury bonds, and while secure don't seem to have growth. My observation tells me their value is mostly inflation protection.

Long-term investing
Currently employed
Have a pension
Little bit of savings (improving monthly)

I had opened a stash account a few months ago when I thought about the idea of investing. I didn’t put anything in it until recently because I wanted to learn as much as I could and I wanted to pay off some debt. Well now that I’m finally CC debt free I figured I’d get my feet wet. 

I was thinking of using my stash account for about a year. That way I can invest and still learn at the same time (read books, YouTube, find out my risk tolerance, etc etc) after that year possible transfer my portfolio to a different broker. (So many options not sure which one I should use). 

I’m already up on my investments. Literally have been reading and researching company’s and ETFs learning about candlesticks and Fundamental.

What I like about Stash: very user friendly, I don’t have to worry about selecting the wrong buy settings (still learning about limit order market order etc) 
Dislike but willing to put up with for now: $1 monthly fee
Hate: stash trading window

What do you all think? Keep stash for a little and then transfer portfolio or just change brokers now?",sunshine0440,1,/r/investing/comments/lf8p1a/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gmkwliq/,0.092,0.863,0.045,-0.8249

So my question is, how do the apps, like webull and RH, work these?

Or, if the stock goes up to $230 and person A exercises their contract, would it force me to buy 100 stocks at $230, making me negative $1400, where I have to quickly activate my own contract with Person B to buy theirs at $205 while the price of the stock is $230, so I can sell them at $230 and get my money back + profit?

346,CORE,"  

I  am a 19yo and maxing my 401k with 85% VTWAX and 15% ARKK. As for my  401k - my employer contributes 7.5% for free without any matching from  me. It's only a job through college so that 7.5% won't be a whole lot of  money, but why not set it up properly.

The fund choices in my 401k, and recommended allocation are as follows:  
[https://imgur.com/a/ABeC8Ff](https://imgur.com/a/ABeC8Ff)  


As to what I want to know

1. Are either of these allocations reasonable?

Ben Felix Inspired: (Main option for now)

DFSIX  - DFA US SUSTAINABILITY CORE 1 (50%) DFSPX - DFA INTL SUSTAINABILITY  CORE 1 (25%) DFVEX - DFA US Vector Equity I (10%) DFCEX - DFA Emerging  Markets Core Equi... (10%) DFGEX - DFA Global Real Estate Securit...  (5%)

My initial choices:

60% DFSIX 30% DFSPX 10% DFCEX

2) Should the sustainability funds be swapped for:

DURPX - US High Relative Profitability, DFIEX - International Core Equity

I  chose sustainability funds initially because I preferred their top  holdings and sector split, but that may be a really stupid way to  choose.

3)

Could  either of my allocation choices be way better with the addition or  subtraction of any available fund on that post in the screenshot.

Specifically Small Cap Value US and Small Cap International Funds, or International Vector Equity?

4)

I was told these funds are actually really good, would it make sense to contribute to the 401k *instead of*  maxing my Roth IRA even if there's no employer match just for access to  these funds? (Employer contributes 7.5% without match). Or is my Roth  IRA better? (Mainly VTWAX) - Initially I'm thinking that Roth is better  because my tax rate is really low, but maybe not?

5)

Anything else I'm missing?

Holdings: 50% VTI, 25% VXUS, 25% VUG as far as my main investments go.

Is it worth rebalancing to try to reduce my large cap growth exposure? It was not initially designed to be such a large part of my portfolio but has grown way faster than my other investments which is certainly not a bad thing! However, I’m concerned that this rapid growth has priced in future earning’s growth and will lag compared to my other ETFs in the short to medium term. As someone in IT I truly believe in the future growth of many companies held by VUG but i know that’s not always 100% correlated with stock growth.

Due to tax idiosyncrasies this year I would be able to sell most of my VUG holdings without paying any LTCG tax, but I doubt that opportunity will present itself beyond this year.

- I am 25 years old and i live in Belgium
- I make 1750/month
- My objective is to increase my savings by investing as i am saving for a house.
- I don't need the money right now, i can invest it for a year without a problem. 
- I would like relative safe stocks, however i dont mind putting a smaller amount in some more high risk high reward stocks.
- I currently have some shares in the SENS stock.
- I have no debts
- I have almost no expenses as I still live with my parents so I can save at least 75% of my salary each month.

-loan ~ 160000kn (25000 USD), for house renovations that will happen about 6 months from now.
-After all expenses (food, loan, bills, gas, etc.) I can probbably save about 200 USD a month with some effort.
- Projected costs of renovations are about 22000-23000 USD, so that leaves me with about 2k USD that I can invest.
- Im looking for something that I can put my money into, time horizont 6 months? Maybe more? 
If I will need the money for emergencies on the house, then I will need it.

I used robinhood and had margin enabled. the only time I ever used margin (as far as I understand) was covering my buys before the cash was transferred into my account to buy stock and calls etc. So in other words every transaction i had with RH was paid in cash (I think or thought) within a few days.

I transferred to fidelity during the great migration last week, the whole ACAT transfer took a few days. To my surprise all my stocks and calls have margin attached to their ""type"" and now I owe margin interest for my (entire?) stock portfolio. I'm having trouble understanding how this is possible; my portfolio is and was 100% covered in cash.

374,DD," For background so you understand where I'm coming from: my experience has been using mutual funds/ETFs as my bread and butter and doing rare picks along with that. Regular monthly contributions to the funds, annual rebalancing, waiting for the 1 yr mark for the long term capital gains rate. Traditional 401(k) is small/mid/large cap distribution a la Dave Ramsey (no bonds due to current age); Roth IRA is mutual funds and aggressive growth ETFs; Individual account is a margin account with mutual funds and the individual picks.

I only do individual stocks or derivatives in the individual account. I'll hear or read about a potential stock from either friends or the internet, then focus on just that one and perform my own DD on that one alone in my free time if it struck me as interesting. Depending on what I determine, I may add cash to the individual account or utilize margin if I'm very confident about the thesis. 

I'd say only do individual stocks if you have the time to do competent DD, and I keep a general rule to never dedicate more than 10% of my individual account (note that its not total of *all* accounts) to an individual play. I don't think size is a relevant factor (outside of avoiding YOLO behavior) as there's the added benefit of using this as a learning experience.

378,FB," I am a complete amateur, but if no one more experienced answers, may I can help ya out.

Options are only done in 100 share increments.

So a call option, is a bullish option, meaning you expect the stock to go up. Your contract means you reserve the right to purchase 100 shares of FB for $270 until March 12th.

On top of this, you paid a fee of $9.35 per share + a commission fee possibly, for this contract.

So if Facebook is ever worth more than $270, say $280, you could purchase 100 shares for $270, and immediately sell them for $280. This is how you profit. Because of the fee you purchased for this option (9.35 per share x 100 shares = $935) You have a break even point before you can profit.

The breakeven point is calculated by the cost of the 100 shares plus your fee, divided by number of shares.

$270 x 100 = $27000

$27000 + $935 = $27935

$27935 / 100 = $279.35

If FB is worth more than $279.35 before end of day March 12th, you will profit on this call option. Because you can buy the 100 shares for $27000, and sell them for $27935 or more.

If FB is never worth more than $270 before end of day March 12th, your call option expires worthless and you lose the fee of $935.

EDIT: You won't simply profit for having this call option, you need to *exercise* (to use) it when it is profitable to do so. I'm not sure how to exercise options as I've never done so, I've just tried my best to understand how they work.",KeyanPrice,2,/r/investing/comments/lf8p1a/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gmlem0m/,0.041,0.753,0.205,0.9937

That lasted a few days and people realized that re-opening was still a ways off and ran back into growth.

A broad pullback I think would be healthy at this point with where the market is, but you could see a more lasting (over 2-3 weeks instead of a few days) rotation out of 2020's winners and into re-opening plays if things actually do get materially better with the current crisis. Or you might see a broader pullback. When? I'm surprised it hasn't happened already.

445,DD," What I've gathered in the last few months: The current market is highly speculative. Stock sentiment seems to out weigh fundamentals. This is caused from a huge influx of retail traders in the last 5 years. You can almost throw a dart at a group of well known stocks, wait a couple of months, and profit. 

When I learn anything in life I always approach it by trying to ask the right questions. I see a lot of people say ""how do I learn investing?"" or ""how do I know which stocks to pick?"", etc. The quality of a question determines the quality of the answer. These low effort, broad questions will not help you learn. Questions like ""what impact does an acquisition have on the company shares?"", ""what impact do earning reports usually have on a stock?"", ""how do I find out if a company taking on debt is good or bad for that company?"", ""where do I go to find short squeeze data?"", ""what does short interest mean?"", ""how do I measure the risk in my portfolio?"" etc will have a far better answer and result in a better understanding of what you're trying to learn. 

Fact check people. If someone says a stock is about to rocket because of xyz, don't just blindly believe them. If they have access to that data/knowledge you should too. For example, I saw a lot of people posting buy/sell orders for GME saying more people were buying more then selling. Orders don't mean anything! 100 buy orders of 1 share is the same as 1 sell order of 100 shares.

If you don't understand what someone is explaining in some DD, ask yourself what parts of this don't I understand? What words are confusing? And then follow through with research till you understand. 

If you do good then humble yourself and realize it's a bull market and if you're losing money on trades, even if it's just a little, that is compoundingly bad in a market where almost everything is green.

Acquisition of Entertainment One is move towards making video content on their IPs. They been licensing some games but I think there is much more growth that could come from licensing PC, console and especially mobile games. One particular example is Games Workshop who received insane valuation recently based on their high margin licensing deals. Then there is potential in digitalising board games and just riding on nostalgia for Dungeons & Dragons by producing some content. The thing is that margins in digital content and licensing are insanely good, much better than in making physical toys and management must know it.

I don't think HAS is extremely undervalued but if you wanted to perhaps make a bet on long term turnaround story this could be it. If management plays it well and use Hasbro's IPs wisely.

But with that said I also think you overlook some of the potential risks. Their book has a mix of investments and some of those are like the ones you mention above that have super high potential.

With that said, if you look at their portfolio and pay off structures, they have a book a VC would dream of esp with the amount of cases that they win.

I was going to post my dd on Burford but I don't have enough comment karma yet - if I may piggy back off your post hitting some points that you may have missed.  

**Positive**

1. Burford expanding its transparency with investors. Litigation Financing has some quantitative aspects but ultimately its’ still a very new non transparent market. Burford tries to apply quantitative methods with explanations to their analysis and while they have been poor in their transparency in the pre-Muddy Waters short attack, they have been much more satisfactory as of late. They have been posting more examples of how their services are used such that there is a better understanding as well as transparency in their portfolio.

2. Counter cyclical – as evident in covid, companies are more likely to violate contracts during times of hazard - especially with capital restrictions. See the insurance company example above. Burford keeps track of investments based on a vintage which has some importance as to the exposure of cases for that year. (You can see this on their portfolio page). One important thing to see in their upcoming guidance is how much capital they deployed this last year.

3. Great investment structure/payoffs (as you mentioned above) – the litigation investments look like mezzanine debt investments (debt with included call options) that gives Burford a yield + equity upside if something blows out. It's worth noting in one of their calls, Burford explained that they will not necessarily go for grandiose payment allocations because it will leave plantiffs in a bad position. In other words, you won your settlement but all your proceeds go to Burford is not a place Burford wants to be – they have many times mentioned they want everyone to be happy and fair.

4. Low Threats of Entrants – this is a highly specialized business. You need to 1) have experience in evaluating litigation merits (probably a law degree) - globally 2) have a large balance sheet to get a diverse portfolio of these kinds of investments and 3) have relationships with law firms that call you to initiate these cases. With that said there are some competitors, both in the form of companies (Bentham) and allocations of funds within hedge funds (ex) DE Shaw)

5. Post short attack, insiders bought both the equity and the bonds. This means that the executives are very happy with their business outlook and are not worried about getting their money back. Additionally, they haven't sold their shares yet.

6. Are on the short list for the majority of the biggest 100 largest law firms. Gives them ability to choose better cases from more options (this is the case of why Burford vs others)

**Negatives**

1. Lumpyness of cash flows – cases can be 1 month or 5 years. This means having a short term view in Burford probably is not a good idea. You can be in the dark for a long time before Burford both wins a case and collects settlement and in many jurisdiction the proceedings cannot be disclosed to the public.

2. Removal of the dividend - while this may be good for fundamental reasons for the business – they find that keeping the capital will be better deployed than returning it to an investor -this is bad for quantitative factors. IE if you invest on rules, this kind of business will be screened out for many years thus removing buying pressure from a piece of the market. There can be many metrics where this fails: ex) dividend growth, has a dividend (for those cash flow investors)

3. They manage funds where the balance sheet doesn’t get the economics outside of the management fee (but these are reported on balance sheet). I’m not sure how the allocation of investments gets chosen to go a certain investor (BS vs outside) but I’d prefer if they stuck to balance sheet investing rather than taking in outside money. This can create some sticky situations regarding allocations and but on the flip side it does mean that this is something that other institutions want to get involved in

**Short Attack Background**

I agree entirely with your comment on Muddy Waters being a ruse. Since then Burford, has listed on the NYSE and EY has always issued clean audit reports on their behalf. The questions Carson kept pushing were vague, and in my opinion had given clean answers. Carson kept coming back but it seemed to be more of a marketing ruse – establish a short, pummel with open ended questions and then cover the short. It got to the point where Carson went to childish tactics to go as far as crashing their anniversary party. ([https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1hznb0j3nqb16/Muddy-Waters-Crashes-Burford-Capital-s-Anniversary-Party](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1hznb0j3nqb16/Muddy-Waters-Crashes-Burford-Capital-s-Anniversary-Party)) There’s a youtube video out there somewhere. 

**Technicals**

Some notable shorts still exist such as Kuvari and Gladstone. The stock itself has some low liquidity (wide bid ask spread, not much turn over) but liquidity is improving this can lead to more consideration by institutional names. There haven’t been many new buyers to instantiate positions up outside of Mithaq. Because of the low liquidity when institutions enter/exit by removing/adding supply some post market drift becomes visible in the name. (watch the post market drift from when Mithaq (long), Kuvari (short) enter their position).

Technicals are weak on the short term, stronger for the intermediate/longer term (measured by momentum/trend)

**Value**

I agree with our valuation it should be somewhere between 1.08 and 3.0. I've been buying the dip especially at the 1.0 level.

It’s worth noting that that pre-2015, 1.08 P/B was the normal and the 2016-2018 window it went as high as 5.5 which we can argue is overvalued. Cutting their book in half (assuming poor marks) you would get 2.00 P/B – I think the margin of safety is there. (I assumed 50% because they have deployed 800 and fair value adjustments 800  in their last filing).

**Risks**

1. There can be accounting fraud… but in the same way that there can be accounting fraud in KKR – low probability possibility but it can happen. These are investments with little transparency

2. There can be aggressive marking to market – this can be screened for by investment conversion to cash which last quarter was good, suggesting this is a lower risk. However, EPS took a big dip which can make someone nervous but this is probably relates to Negative point 1 (uncertainty of cash flows). It’s worth noting that it means that at any time book values can compress aggressively from the realization of returns.

3. Some jurisdictions are not favorable to litigation financing as they believe this causes more frivolous litigation (and logically it should). This ideology can spread around. It’s worth noting that if Burford thinks you won’t win it probably won’t invest in the case.

4. There are some outsized cases on their balance sheet. An example is the Petersen case. They financed the litigation but as other investors wanted in at higher multiples Burford was able to sell it to them at a higher multiple and thus mark-to-market the investment higher on their books. (For example, I finance for 10M (cost), someone wants a 10% stake at 10M, I sell them a 10% at 10M, making my remaining 9M investment now worth 90M. I think this is one of Muddy Water’s main arguments. They advocated for holding the investments as cost basis vs mark to market. )

5. Counter party risk - even if you win the lawsuit someone still has to pay. And if you go after the same insurance company 1000x, time 100 it can go bankrupt. Sometimes it can be the 1st time they don’t have the money. I’m sure some of this counterparty risk goes into Burford’s anlaysis but I don’t know this.

I have some theoretical examples if someone is interested of how litigation finance works. Similarly to the poster I think this investment crushes it in the future and I would agree at this price level it's worth to overweight the investment.",QuantitativeTendies,2,/r/investing/comments/lfdt7x/due_diligence_on_bur_burford_capital_litigation/gmlzv1g/,0.107,0.785,0.108,0.9058

Burford tries to apply quantitative methods with explanations to their analysis and while they have been poor in their transparency in the pre-Muddy Waters short attack, they have been much more satisfactory as of late. They have been posting more examples of how their services are used such that there is a better understanding as well as transparency in their portfolio.

2. Counter cyclical – as evident in covid, companies are more likely to violate contracts during times of hazard - especially with capital restrictions. See the insurance company example above. Burford keeps track of investments based on a vintage which has some importance as to the exposure of cases for that year. (You can see this on their portfolio page). One important thing to see in their upcoming guidance is how much capital they deployed this last year.

3. Great investment structure/payoffs (as you mentioned above) – the litigation investments look like mezzanine debt investments (debt with included call options) that gives Burford a yield + equity upside if something blows out. It's worth noting in one of their calls, Burford explained that they will not necessarily go for grandiose payment allocations because it will leave plantiffs in a bad position. In other words, you won your settlement but all your proceeds go to Burford is not a place Burford wants to be – they have many times mentioned they want everyone to be happy and fair.

4. Low Threats of Entrants – this is a highly specialized business. You need to 1) have experience in evaluating litigation merits (probably a law degree) - globally 2) have a large balance sheet to get a diverse portfolio of these kinds of investments and 3) have relationships with law firms that call you to initiate these cases. With that said there are some competitors, both in the form of companies (Bentham) and allocations of funds within hedge funds (ex) DE Shaw)

5. Post short attack, insiders bought both the equity and the bonds. This means that the executives are very happy with their business outlook and are not worried about getting their money back. Additionally, they haven't sold their shares yet.

6. Are on the short list for the majority of the biggest 100 largest law firms. Gives them ability to choose better cases from more options (this is the case of why Burford vs others)

**Negatives**

1. Lumpyness of cash flows – cases can be 1 month or 5 years. This means having a short term view in Burford probably is not a good idea. You can be in the dark for a long time before Burford both wins a case and collects settlement and in many jurisdiction the proceedings cannot be disclosed to the public.

2. Removal of the dividend - while this may be good for fundamental reasons for the business – they find that keeping the capital will be better deployed than returning it to an investor -this is bad for quantitative factors. IE if you invest on rules, this kind of business will be screened out for many years thus removing buying pressure from a piece of the market. There can be many metrics where this fails: ex) dividend growth, has a dividend (for those cash flow investors)

3. They manage funds where the balance sheet doesn’t get the economics outside of the management fee (but these are reported on balance sheet). I’m not sure how the allocation of investments gets chosen to go a certain investor (BS vs outside) but I’d prefer if they stuck to balance sheet investing rather than taking in outside money. This can create some sticky situations regarding allocations and but on the flip side it does mean that this is something that other institutions want to get involved in

**Short Attack Background**

I agree entirely with your comment on Muddy Waters being a ruse. Since then Burford, has listed on the NYSE and EY has always issued clean audit reports on their behalf. The questions Carson kept pushing were vague, and in my opinion had given clean answers. Carson kept coming back but it seemed to be more of a marketing ruse – establish a short, pummel with open ended questions and then cover the short. It got to the point where Carson went to childish tactics to go as far as crashing their anniversary party. ([https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1hznb0j3nqb16/Muddy-Waters-Crashes-Burford-Capital-s-Anniversary-Party](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1hznb0j3nqb16/Muddy-Waters-Crashes-Burford-Capital-s-Anniversary-Party)) There’s a youtube video out there somewhere. 

**Technicals**

Some notable shorts still exist such as Kuvari and Gladstone. The stock itself has some low liquidity (wide bid ask spread, not much turn over) but liquidity is improving this can lead to more consideration by institutional names. There haven’t been many new buyers to instantiate positions up outside of Mithaq. Because of the low liquidity when institutions enter/exit by removing/adding supply some post market drift becomes visible in the name. (watch the post market drift from when Mithaq (long), Kuvari (short) enter their position).

Technicals are weak on the short term, stronger for the intermediate/longer term (measured by momentum/trend)

**Value**

I agree with our valuation it should be somewhere between 1.08 and 3.0. I've been buying the dip especially at the 1.0 level.

It’s worth noting that that pre-2015, 1.08 P/B was the normal and the 2016-2018 window it went as high as 5.5 which we can argue is overvalued. Cutting their book in half (assuming poor marks) you would get 2.00 P/B – I think the margin of safety is there. (I assumed 50% because they have deployed 800 and fair value adjustments 800  in their last filing).

**Risks**

1. There can be accounting fraud… but in the same way that there can be accounting fraud in KKR – low probability possibility but it can happen. These are investments with little transparency

2. There can be aggressive marking to market – this can be screened for by investment conversion to cash which last quarter was good, suggesting this is a lower risk. However, EPS took a big dip which can make someone nervous but this is probably relates to Negative point 1 (uncertainty of cash flows). It’s worth noting that it means that at any time book values can compress aggressively from the realization of returns.

3. Some jurisdictions are not favorable to litigation financing as they believe this causes more frivolous litigation (and logically it should). This ideology can spread around. It’s worth noting that if Burford thinks you won’t win it probably won’t invest in the case.

4. There are some outsized cases on their balance sheet. An example is the Petersen case. They financed the litigation but as other investors wanted in at higher multiples Burford was able to sell it to them at a higher multiple and thus mark-to-market the investment higher on their books. (For example, I finance for 10M (cost), someone wants a 10% stake at 10M, I sell them a 10% at 10M, making my remaining 9M investment now worth 90M. I think this is one of Muddy Water’s main arguments. They advocated for holding the investments as cost basis vs mark to market. )

5. Counter party risk - even if you win the lawsuit someone still has to pay. And if you go after the same insurance company 1000x, time 100 it can go bankrupt. Sometimes it can be the 1st time they don’t have the money. I’m sure some of this counterparty risk goes into Burford’s anlaysis but I don’t know this.

467,PB," I agree with your view your bullish view but not sure I agree with your price target of 30bn - with a 3x PB putting it closer to 8bn market cap than 30 - but with it's aggressive growth \~ 20% book  over 5 years it can get there pretty quick. But with that said I also think you overlook some of the potential risks. Their book has a mix of investments and some of those are like the ones you mention above that have super high potential. But it's worth nothing that the ones with the highest pay off are usually the highest risk so they typically will have much lower probability of paying off. With that said, if you look at their portfolio and pay off structures, they have a book a VC would dream of esp with the amount of cases that they win.

482,TSLA,"  I've been trying to find more information on this but upon searching IBKR only shows TSLA margin maintenance at 40% for long positions. Very strange. 

  
Is the concentration adjustment relevant in a Reg-T margin account? I thought Portfolio Margin was the one that determined how much more you could borrow if your portfolio was diversified?

484,TD," Their website is often out of date for margin requirements because they can change so quickly. The only reliable way to check is to preview the order or click check margin on TWS.

I know concentration applies to portfolio margin and I assume it would also apply to Reg T. Here's an explanation from TD explaining their approach (I know it's not IB, but it will help you understand:

[https://tlc.thinkorswim.com/center/howToTos/thinkManual/Miscellaneous/Margin/Concentration.html](https://tlc.thinkorswim.com/center/howToTos/thinkManual/Miscellaneous/Margin/Concentration.html)

This is from IB about portfolio margin:

""IB also considers a number of house scenarios to capture additional  risks such as extreme market moves, concentrated positions and shifts in  option implied volatilities.""

[https://www1.interactivebrokers.com/en/?f=%2Fen%2Fgeneral%2Feducation%2Fpdfnotes%2FWN-UnderstandingIBMargin.php%3Fib\_entity%3Din](https://www1.interactivebrokers.com/en/?f=%2Fen%2Fgeneral%2Feducation%2Fpdfnotes%2FWN-UnderstandingIBMargin.php%3Fib_entity%3Din)

You might even get hit with an exposure fee for highly concentrated positions:

""Holding one or more highly concentrated single position(s) generally  expose an account to significant risk exposure and, hence, increases the  likelihood of an account being assessed an Exposure Fee. Managing risk  through diversification and hedging may reduce the risk and reduce or eliminate the Exposure Fee.""

There's so many ""disruptive"" stories that basically had a rare kind of fantastic year last year and they could keep going up but I think with that you're almost betting on more money flow into Ark and the like.

I think what the Covid crisis did is basically pull forward a few years worth of growth/adoption in a lot of names - the ""digital transformation"" theme has been discussed by many tech companies this year as the current crisis caused many companies to accelerate what would have otherwise maybe been multi-year plans.

I think Ocado will be a good company in the coming years (although will certainly be something that's sold if this crisis is ever over), but the gradual adoption/growth story that I thought was going to play out over 5 years now played out fairly heavily over 1 and that's something that has to be kept in mind.

It's very hard imo to really find something that is early in its growth stage that isn't crowded/expensive at this point.

Defensive companies like VZ, D, AEP, PEP, KMB have all been trading down towards their low-end technical support levels. As the market races to new highs, big institutional investors treat these defensives as a source of funds to pull from to fund purchases of the hot stocks that are running up. As the hot stocks become over-valued and lose momentum (which looks to be starting to happen in several high flyers), the defensives will climb in value again as the institutions lock in gains from high flyers and return them to their safe stocks.. Not to mention the dividend value of these defensives increase as their price goes down. Most of these are currently offering 3-5% yields.

516,KMB," Agree with your thesis that there are some attractive opportunities among the more defensive stocks..

Defensive companies like VZ, D, AEP, PEP, KMB have all been trading down towards their low-end technical support levels. As the market races to new highs, big institutional investors treat these defensives as a source of funds to pull from to fund purchases of the hot stocks that are running up. As the hot stocks become over-valued and lose momentum (which looks to be starting to happen in several high flyers), the defensives will climb in value again as the institutions lock in gains from high flyers and return them to their safe stocks.. Not to mention the dividend value of these defensives increase as their price goes down. Most of these are currently offering 3-5% yields.

519,BCH," This is a complete mischaracterization. You make it sound like the segwit/BCH fork was evidence of the supply being uncapped, when in reality it was evidence FOR the supply practically speaking being capped. The situation proved that despite a cabal of the most powerful companies and people in crypto trying to change a technical variable, they could not get it done because a relatively small number of users stood in the way. The community did not split into two equal camps. A rebel movement tried and failed to change the block size and has slowly withered away into irrelevance while the original chain continued to accrue value. 

BTC being ruled by consensus does NOT equal a democracy where important variables like the supply cap shift with the winds of public opinion or the whims of the powerful. It means that it requires near absolute unanimity amongst all users of all kinds. Given that the supply cap of 21M is one of the most cherished aspects of the system, the idea that you could actually get 95%+ of BTC users to agree to changing it is outright preposterous. 

The bitcoin core developers literally have zero control over the most meaningful aspects of the currency. None of their client updates required a hard fork, which is what you would need to change the cap. You could be using ancient versions of BTC core and it would work just fine. And BTC core is only one of many clients which have all followed the same consensus rules since forever.

521,VERY," 1. Miners have zero incentive to undermine the currency that they mine.
2. Funny that you try and use yet another failed hard fork to try to prove a point that miners can collude to hard fork.
3. This is just total fucking nonsense, because they can ""easily"" triple it - in a hard fork that no one will recognize as legitimate.

You are still using stupid contrived and completely implausible examples to try and VERY VERY deceitfully convince people unfamiliar with BTC that these things are realistic possibilities. You're being so disgracefully deceitful right now and trying so hard that I can only imagine you have a hidden agenda here. This is like QAnon levels of crazy conspiracy bullshit that you are spouting right now.

In fact if you asked me which is more plausible between:

A) miners colluding to raise the supply cap and actually succeeding in getting the world to accept it as the new BTC

B) the Democratic party is a front for a secret child trafficking prostitution ring run out of the basement of a pizzeria

...I would go with option B.",Darius510,2,/r/investing/comments/lfccpo/microstrategy_ceo_michael_saylor_and_others_are/gml6024/,0.163,0.742,0.095,-0.8853
522,BCH," How do you know it's not in miners' best interest to double their coin rewards short term? How do you know they wouldn't want it? You are speaking for a very large group of people, another symptom of fraud. As a reminder big Chinese miners this year tried to implement a developer tax and caused a split in BCH. A lot of BTC miners in the past have signaled to be for a block limit increase, but against their will the block size was kept unchanged. 

You are miacharacterizing the likelihood of a consensus shift, and you're flat out lying when you say ""everyone"" needs to be on board. 

Either way your long answers prove that btc's supply is consensus based. This is also why Bitcoin Core has admitted having an army of shills to control consensus. 

You seem to disagree with me on how likely it is that consensus on supply may shift to increase it, but in fact that's a well calculated move to control narrative. 

You're not gold. 

You're not silver.

**BTC is a fraud.**

By the way I already linked an article about a Bitcoin Core developer advocating for the supply cap increase.",zeroboundss,0,/r/investing/comments/lfccpo/microstrategy_ceo_michael_saylor_and_others_are/gml7lkb/,0.096,0.828,0.076,-0.7189
