When a CEO gets on twitter like this but has no revenue between both companies merging red flags should be going off.

I trade about 80% of my port on oil and gas companies since I know them well and have experience understanding their reporting. I did throw this together very quickly after last night's pump put it on my radar but I haven't read an annual report that states a company is dead that many times repeatedly in awhile. This company has major issues and the dividend won't play out imo off those assets. Wink was their only good asset and it looks like they sold it to give their partner a loan.

They killed that whole operation with their other issues and currently it's one of my biggest holdings I've had since the $3s. 

Vickie wanted to be the biggest CEO in O&G as a woman. She shouldn't have been allowed to do what she did with Anadarko.

As for TRCH, that's why I worry about where this goes moving forward because I don't see how they can sell their land at a good value when everyone is still sitting on their hands.
