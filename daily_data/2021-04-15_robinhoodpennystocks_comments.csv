1,AGTC," Don't feel too bad.  I had finally had enough of the red and sold my 1500 AGTC for a not insignificant loss at 8:00 AM yesterday only to watch it immediately shoot up about 30 cents per share and hover there all morning, just daring me to buy back in.  You're welcome, holders.

77,DD," You gotta do your own due diligence. Some basics:

Are their financials in good shape? Get their published financials? Do they have revenue? Are they making a profit? Do they carry a lot of debt?

Is there a ton of stock floating around (ie didnthey recently issue a bunch of stock to try and raise money. If they did that is typically bad news as it dilutes the stock value?

Do they have a business catalyst that will drive new business. A patent that will make a lot of money mom an industry that is hot...for example.

Only you can determine for sure if your money is in the right place.

I have stock in an OTC LVVV. It‚Äôs a Canabis play I think could explode. I‚Äôve done the homework I like the stock. I‚Äôm down 40%. There is a regulatory hurdle they have to jump in CA...I think once that happens this will be a great play.

I could be wrong but I am confident in my research and I can live with the fact that I made the wrong choice because.

I invested money i could afford to lose 
I‚Äôve done my research

. I heard about the stock on this subreddit but I surely didn‚Äôt toss hard earned money at something without my own DD.

It sounds like you didn‚Äôt do this stuff...if not u have some homework..

If you didn‚Äôt do DD...don‚Äôt compound your error by selling what could be a profitable bag of stock....
