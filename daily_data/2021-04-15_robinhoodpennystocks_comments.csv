17,ASRT," Its worth mentioning that they were going to do one or the other, not both after a shareholder vote, theres alot of misinformation abound about that on various ASRT forums but basically its a tactic to stay above 1.00 so they dont get booted.

The idea was a reverse split to prop up the price, or a another shar  increase so buying raised the price and the meeting was to vote on which, its entirely possible that neither will pass as well.

with the current state of pharma pennies its still impossible to judge whether its hype, the market, or whatever hurting them but theres too many rumors about buyouts, the R/S, shorts intended ot put other companies in a better position etc to make a solid judgement on whats real but i do think at least the R/S worries are minor at worst",Lunerem,7,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/mqt6il/sold_the_last_of_my_asrt_at_a_loss_with_the/gui53yk/,0.094,0.824,0.082,-0.5789

24,ASRT," If you have 100 shares of a $.50 stock, a $10 premium is 20% of the stock's value per month. Hard to find anything else that will perform at +20% per month. Half the reason to even do penny stocks in the first place is to peddle the covered calls, because the low share prices give you disproportionate gains on the premiums once they bottom out.

Personally I've got 1000 in ASRT, and while I'm disappointed in the stock, you bet your butt I will be riding the free $100/month from $10 premiums until the calls eventually sell...and the longer it takes to sell, the more money I make.",FedRishFlueBish,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/mqt6il/sold_the_last_of_my_asrt_at_a_loss_with_the/gukjxcj/,0.057,0.835,0.108,0.7096
