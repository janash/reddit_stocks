Now it's more than sufficient to stop once each {morning, afternoon, and evening}; sort by new, and frequently there will still be **nothing** new.

2,DD," > our initial thoughts were something along the lines of this: if you can google the answer to something it should not be a post here. But if you can demonstrate that you have done a fair bit of research on something and are having trouble connecting the dots, or having trouble seeing the mechanics behind a concept, then that would likely be a good post to open up for discussion.

Maybe there is a bit of a blind spot.  This seems to suggest that the only reason to post is to ask a question or otherwise get educated.  Even replies in this thread questioning that is just met with thoughts on what types of questions are worthy.

I’m most interested in someone’s DD or strategies than their questions.  That's why I’m on this sub anyway.

Just some user data from someone that used to spend more time here  than I do these days:

/r/investing - DD on individual issuances

/r/wallstreetbets - discussing short term strategies, general BSing/chatting in daily threads (that get thousands of comments).

/r/thetagang - discussion strategies for selling options for that part of my portfolio.  Heavy personal crossover between there and this sub as I consider which stocks to sell options on.

/r/financialindependence and related subs for broader purpose of why I’m investing.

I generally consider this sub for the mainstay individual issuances of my portfolio, the Buffet/Munger voice - this is the niche not better served elsewhere.

As I type this there are 60+ comments across two different daily threads and 4 posts in the last 24 hours.   Would advise loosing restrictions and, perhaps more importantly, not forcing too many convos into daily threads that are currently not being used.  There’s just not the traffic.

May or may not be the response you’re looking for, but I used to comment some and visit more often so wanted to share if helpful.",Lightning_zolt,3,/r/investing/comments/my953u/feedback_post_were_considering_revisingspecifying/gvuti44/,0.047,0.877,0.076,0.8901

The problem is that when you take a look at the overwhelming majority of DD around here, your users by and large do not think to ask pointed, probing questions themselves...   They don't have that level of intermediate finance experience that puts their feet to the fire where they learn to anticipate those questions from EVP's, CFO's and shareholders.  And I'm not expecting them to... but that's kind of the point.

This is Reddit, not the Financial Times.  There are very few of us with actual accounting/finance backgrounds and real world FP&A experience.  And then there's a whole lot of beginners.  There's not much in between... unless you work to cultivate and elevate the beginners to the kind of people who ask the questions you want, which is a lot of hands-on moderation, most of the people who do ask those questions don't have much time or inclination to deal with the broader (read: troubling) aspects of Reddit.

You have to invest much more time and effort to cultivate the community you want... or accept what the community is now and roll with it.  

As both an editor of two publications and a moderator of a professional community, I know that's not an easy choice to make, and I know that moderating is a lot of work, but at the end of the day you have to choose one or the other;  you'll struggle trying to be both.",th3cr1t1c,15,/r/investing/comments/my953u/feedback_post_were_considering_revisingspecifying/gvtqumj/,0.034,0.904,0.062,0.6418

27,DD," yeah there is a problem here for sure. i tried to make a post a month ago on ""what were your worst investing mistakes?"" well it wasn't allowed and so i posted it in r/stocks. it garnered 70 upvotes so far and over 150 comments and multiple awards. however the post was clearly better suited for a sub named ""investing"".

 your rules here are so restrictive. micromanagement never works. let things be organic and let the community decide. like, if i put a single emoji i get a bot telling me i have strayed too far from WSB? what is that? just insulting. this is reddit not a concentration camp. 

just my opinion but i never read DD posts. always suspect imo. i was really hoping this sub could be about people asking and answering interesting questions...to have a deeper understanding of economics and the market. things that are company specific are less interesting to me. if i like a stock it's because i did my own research. investing is about understanding micro and macroneconomic concepts. risk models, portfolio allocation. and useful links to videos or articles on such topics. that's what this should be about. there is no good place on the web that does this. bogleheads.org or morningstar forums to an extent. but reddit is a much bigger better open platform. you are sitting on a gold mine here but instead this place feels stifled.

it should also not **only** be about letting the most experienced investors write posts either. that's what i see here. less experienced investors don't have a voice. most less experienced investors have more questions than answers. and thats **OK**. EVERYONE was a less experienced investor at some point. more experienced investors are very happy to help out others. in your rules make it visible to ""try your best"" to find your answer in previous posts. but  if the same question gets asked by accident, let the community refer the poster to a prior post, don't just kill it. you lose users very quickly that way.",hutch_man0,3,/r/investing/comments/my953u/feedback_post_were_considering_revisingspecifying/gvu0tnv/,0.068,0.774,0.158,0.9879

There are fundamental and technical reasons those investments provide (insane) alpha. And they get called gambling without any punishment by the moderators. This creates groupthink which drives out critical thinkers.

I post here, rarely. And I use an inverse correlation between comment sentiment and the strength of my idea. If people in here criticize and idea, especially without a fundamental or technical reply, I know I'm on to something because boomer money is ignoring it.

> **Investing** is the act of allocating resources, usually money, with the expectation of generating an income or profit. You can invest in endeavors, such as using money to start a business, or in assets, such as purchasing real estate in hopes of reselling it later at a higher price.

30,DD," >What framework to use for differentiating when a post should be in the daily thread vs when it can be a self post.

Why not specificity?  e.g. if we decide as a community that the bar for investment thesis is a focused, narrow, specific hypothesis, ""e.g. XYZ's rising expense accruals are cause for concern in Q4/22,"" then likewise the bar for a daily discussion help question vs. self post might be the degree to which the question is specific and complex enough that it'll get lost in the flow of the daily thread and requires more of a detailed response than a sentence or two.

Let's put that another way:  In FP&A most of our forecasts, DD, etc., are a team effort.  So maybe the kind of questions that benefit from a team approach are the beginner questions that warrant a self post instead of a daily thread comment.",th3cr1t1c,7,/r/investing/comments/my953u/feedback_post_were_considering_revisingspecifying/gvu3o1b/,0.016,0.918,0.066,0.743
31,DD," That's where I think the ""team effort"" (see my second paragraph) aspect is a good qualifier.

The other thing I want to say is that, from a professional perspective, I expect more from experienced people than inexperienced people... that's why I'm more forgiving if someone who is clearly a beginner asks a question that can be googled vs. a twenty-seven paragraph DD that presents itself as a serious analysis but misses a critical detail.  More of the intended audience for the latter are going to be regarding that DD as thoroughly researched... let me expand on that a bit:

When I do a writeup for an EVP, I must always assume they're going to walk into a meeting with C-level and board-level folks and present it as gospel.  I assume that any part of my data could show up in a company-wide town hall meeting or quarterly earnings report.  Decisions are going to be made, people hired or laid off, on my data.... so it had better be correct.

While no one here purports to be presenting DD as a financial advisor, broker, dealer, portfolio manager, or the like, there are real world consequences for DD that misses a microscopic detail... Someone asking a beginner question 100 times isn't capable of doing as much damage as one person's fair value estimate being off by so much as five percent.  That's also why I'm wary of letting anything pass for DD.  I just wanted to clear that up... I am not being a hard-ass for no reason.  Someone's life savings will go into one or more companies that were DD'd here... it may not be a question of legal liability, but it is absolutely a  question of moral responsibility, accountability and ethics.",th3cr1t1c,4,/r/investing/comments/my953u/feedback_post_were_considering_revisingspecifying/gvu6m1j/,0.079,0.824,0.096,0.6144
32,DD," Part of this is a time requirement - we're all short on that.  Do you have interest in helping provide some of that content? 

Regarding DD - one of the things the mods have been chatting about is adding a big disclaimer that all DD should be scrutinized heavily.
