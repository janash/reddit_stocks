0,AMC," The sad part is that for some stock a +69%  day can be the premise of a 500% run.....

We never mention this enough but if you bought AMC when it went from 14 to 20 that one time, you literally bought on a +42% day... And yet if you SOLD at 20 you probably necked yourself 2 weeks later (or not.)

It's the exception, not the rule, but I can't stay mad at apes who think something will go up 100% tomorrow....",arbiter12,34,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ode6ey/pro_moves/h40f35l/,0.025,0.933,0.042,0.3382

500 individuals all buy 100 AMC shares on Robinhood at $58. Before those shares are purchased, Citadel will decide whether to short or not. They have a 'standing order' with Robinhood where RH can't refuse to loan them the shares. It's automatic. So Citadel decides it will go ahead and pay interest for the borrow. 

Now, they are here to make profits, so how can they maximize this situation? Easy. Let's say they KNOW for a FACT there are limit sells at price X. So they buy your stock (owed to RH) in a dark pool, and then sell it on the open market to drop the price. (the price never goes up). So the price drops from, say, $58, down to where those limit sell triggers are, which is $54. They did the calculations on how many shares they need to sell to hit $54 triggering the extra sell off. So they sell all those shorted shares, drops the price to $54 which triggers the sell limits. The sell limits then cause an additional million shares to sell, dropping the price to $47 and then they buy back those shorted shares at $47 on the retail market driving the price up to $55 where they hand them at $58 to Robinhood. You, the ape, just lost $3. Citadel just Sold shares at $58 and bought back at $47 and pocketed the difference. TO make matters worse, you now get mad and sell your shares at $55 for a $3 loss. Robinhood makes all that commissions masked as 'best price' when it's not.

153,AMC," One thing is evident - Some hedge funds and MMs got killed earlier this year.

What is surprising to me is people think that they are just going to roll over and take that beating.

Ever since retail has been getting played, the big dogs have been making all of that money back, and they are going to make damn sure that the end game here absolutely destroys retail so every time in the future something like this arises people go ""Remember that time I lost everything on meme stocks? Yeah, won't do that again.""

They can't see it now because they are still winning in that the stocks are up and holding. Meanwhile, the big dogs are also holding these things and selling options that are making money hand over fist off the backs of retail who missed the squeezes and are trying to make up / play catch up by buying YOLO options. The big boys will cash in once these things go sideways long enough that the IV comes down, the premium isn't worth it, and the memes go right back to where they are supposed to be.

And I'm here for the future loss porn. At least from those with the balls to actually share. The rest are just cowards who will vanish. Did you buy in at $10 on AMC and $60 on GME? Maybe.

350,MSFT," I agree, which is another reason I favor the Wyckoff read in this ticker. That doesn’t mean my way is the right way. I’ve had some critiques that this lens is too detached from fundamental factors at work on the price. I don’t deny that. However, the complete lack of reaction PSFE’s chart has to any PR—like the MSFT news—tells me it’s detached from fundamentals and that big money, and the Wyckoff read, are the prevailing forces at work.

That isn’t to say it can’t be a variety of factors or to ignore the possibility that it takes a fundamental catalyst to break the schematic (like earnings), but anyone who has been watching it sees how news does literally nothing for the stock—if not moves it down. That’s one reason why I lean so hard into this interpretation personally. Big money is loading up the boat and hopes people ignore those bits of news and panic sell.

375,USA," Degradation is due to many factors. But simply put current small power lines of the grid has cause a 2% loss on average.  Large transmissions lines suffer a minuscule loss. The smaller the mains the less voltage. The larger the trunks the higher voltage. A proper grid the losses would be under a 2/10th of a %. The Trunks would be above ground but the secondary’s need to be under ground. They last longer underground from deterioration, storms and as such are cost efficient once in   Nuclear power is the most efficient power generation known to man.  As long as it’s not melting down it is the cleanest as well and less impactful to the environment. The reason for centralized location on the USA is two fold.

380,NYC," Recommending Google searches? Literally type in Google “ why do power plants have so much loss and it explains it in greater detail.  A 10th grade science education can understand how electrical energy moves and why it moves at a constant rate. Primary reason for loss is small lines cannot withstand high voltage.  Higher voltage counter balances loss.  Current loss is just 2% with a grid running off 1950’s technology. 2% adds up when burning fossil fuels. With nuke power it’s so efficient the potential loss is simply not a concern.  The reasoning for placing nuke plants far away from urban areas is based upon Chernobyl and our own 3mile Island.  Indians point is just 36 miles from Manhattan. Chernobyl has a 20 mile circle of no go zone around it. The need for a centralized nuclear power is obvious. A Chernobyl event that close to NYC would make Gold go to $85k an oz in four hours   Imagine 25m people have no place to live anymore?   Imagine 800k people dying in 1-14 days and another 3m with cancer ?  Even if we have harvested all the rare earth minerals the most we can generate from wind , solar, water is 38% of current energy demands.  Forced to burn coal and natural gas   Centralized Nuke power all
Over the planet is the only way to reverse climate change.  We could save so much on power generation it would actually be cost effective to launch spent fuel rods off the planet and send them into the sun than bury them in Washington state etc.

381,USA, THANK YOU so much for your thoughtful reply. Really means a lot now a days with so many mean people on the internet.  I guess my main concern is that an Indian point accident would destroy society forever in the USA And the World. No more Mars Rovers or Webb Telescopes etc etc projects. It would be our version of Fermi paradox filter and a permanent dark age. I can foresee no other solution for the planet going forward than to build another 2k plants.  The law of averages though we should build them in very remote locations just to be safe. Collectively as a planet then everyone receives power they need.  The Paris climate accord is well intentioned but does nothing to halt what China/India are doing to the planet.  Nuke plants are $9billion each x 2k. Plus $5 trillion to run the grid on the planet?

432,BA," Just to add some perspective from someone in the biology side, while their platform accelerates the antibody discovery side, there is a lot more work and regulations to pass for non COVID drugs. One of those hurdles is what organism is used to generate the initial B-cells. In the case of their COVID drug with Eli Lilly, Bamlanivimab or LY-Cov555, the antibodies/B-cells screened to discover it were from a human, which is normally not the case for antibody discovery and significantly reduced timelines. Usually, B-cells are harvested from immunized mice, rabbits, or even llamas. It does look like AbCellera has obtained a transgenic humanized mouse company Trianni, but even with a humanized mouse platform, getting a potent drug to enter the clinic and being approved outside an emergency situation will take years.

For an example of long side taking full control look up Falcone and the MAAX bonds squeeze.  SEC decided that was market manipulation.   

Also the level of collaboration required would likely view the SEC as viewing the buyers as a group needing to disclose ownership of a significant stake in the company.

Been in AMC and GME before ever knowing about WSB,nak_12,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/odqzej/amc_ready_to_take_a_shit/h422o7q/,0.0,0.945,0.055,0.4767
509,DISCA," If i make no mistakes, DISCA is one of stocks held by Archegos, right?

the reason why the stock gained so much months ago was due to Bill H. used multiple bank account and 30x leverage and bought millions of DISCA shares.

now we have surplus of DISCA shares in the wild and demand is not that high (only 5M $ per day), i don't see a very optimistic future about this stock, unless some billionaire buy all DISCA shares in bulk.",WidepeepoHappysad,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/odmmdb/disca_ready_to_launch/h419au9/,0.096,0.799,0.105,0.2074
