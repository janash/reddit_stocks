15,USA," I am not arguing the USA is perfect. It most definitely has its flaws, and maybe you were more afraid of Trump than Zi, that's fine. I cannot say what you should fear more as that is purely opinion, but you can't seriously act like China is somehow better? They aren't even close to equal. 

Yes we have been in more wars, but China is quite literally committing genocide. You can find a thousand more things to throw on top of that (forced sterilization, mass rape, etc). It boggles my mind that you could try and defend that (yes, that is what you are doing when you try to claim the USA is somehow worse or equal in terms of their evil) when so much evidence goes against it. 

There are wars we fought that we did for the wrong reasons, we have a lot of internal issues to solve, but nothing, *nothing* we have ever done has ever come even close to the scale of what China has done and is still doing. It amazes me that people act like what Nazi Germany did was beyond evil and hate them so much for it, but then so readily defend China for the *exact* same things. 

I suppose what it seems to come down to is people just hate America so much that they'd rather sleep with China and her sins than admit America is better than that. Which is quite sad honestly. It just goes to show how the nazis were able to get so far... Indeed history repeats itself. 

People can act like Trump and America were the worst and act afraid of them, but that is quite silly honestly. You should be deathly afraid of China, it's mass genocide, glorified rape, forced sterilization, lack of basic human rights and so much more. You should be afraid that that goes unhindered by the world (yes, even the USA is guilty for not doing more to stop it) and is so easily ignored. 

This is why and how Hitler was allowed to get so far, no one, not one, has any right to ever criticize Trump, Biden or whoever you hate if they are so willingly ignoring what China is doing.

That's why the title is like that.

Will say that China's crackdown is concerning not in the sense that my shares of BABA/Tencent will get wiped out or integrated into the CCP. But more concerning as Xi could be doing harm to China (and the party) itself in the long term solely for the sake of protecting his own 3rd term and best interests.

This concern of the possible long term impact Xi might be doing to China itself comes from his actions to secure his 3rd term. IMO Xi is playing the political game: creating a strong base locking the party/citizens/country inwards by creating pressure from outside of China (accomplished by being a bad international actor), cracked down on political rivals as soon as he got his seat, pushed the stick and carrots to all their neighbors, and has cracked down on any other possible contests to his 3rd term: (Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Tibet, Real estate moguls, Tech titans, foreign press, etcetc). 

There's also the inherent danger of dictatorship. Right now Xi has had more power and has been more willing to wield/abuse it than any other person in CCP history outside of Mao himself. The optimist will say the party is about preservation and that will motivate them to do their best for the people. Xi would follow the same principle and do his best for the party and thus the people. More and more it's not looking like that is the case. Xi might still try to hold up his promise to do good by the people, but the CCP seems to have been reigned in by Xi himself. It's hard to see clearly from the outside, but at this point it looks like the party is following whatever Xi wants rather than what is best for the party.

Some of the stuff Xi can easily walk back like the regulation and price damage to the tech titans, lightening up on Hong Kong, new real estate moguls, etcetc. Some of the other stuff might be harder/longer to reverse if at all: Xinjiang/Tibet (if the worst of the western accusations are true), fried relations with rivals, global opinion of China, foreign investor confidence, etcetc. That coupled with internal issues like environment degradation, corrupt bizmen/ccpmen, and an aging could mean China sees a Japanese style stagnation even if they don't have a asset bubble explosion.

22,EM," There's a reason for that. 

    China/Population

    Taiwan/Population

    14.34 trillion USD (2019)
    
    Taiwan/Gross domestic product  
    612.17 billion USD (2019)

China is so much because it's by far the largest emerging market. Taiwan punches far above its weight when you consider how small it is.

When you add up how much China this would involve in a typical retirement account this is still a tiny percentage, because you presumably aren't putting 100% of your retirement into EM funds.

If you hold at market weight, EM is around 10% and China is around 3.5%. That's not excessive exposure to China. And most Americans don't even hold international stocks at market weight, they significantly underweight them. So the China % would be even less.

People wind themselves up something uncanny trying to avoid China, it is not all going to go to zero and has a very obvious upside. But even if it did, why wind yourself up to this degree over what is presumably 1-3% of your portfolio? That's what diversification is for.

Ex-US funds are primarily designed so that *Americans* can add to their primary US holdings, without duplication. Ex-US funds are *American* funds, they don't have ex-US in Europe for example.

25,UK," We can have disagreeing opinions on this. But from the way I see it:

>**How does the crackdown benefiting him immediately**

When I speak of crackdowns I'm not speaking solely of the tech ones. All the crackdowns have benefitted Xi directly and immediately because it further instills fear into everyone, takes out another ""potential opposition"", and strengthens his own position. All for the goal of his 3rd term. Like I said before Xi's been

*""creating a strong base locking the party/citizens/country inwards by creating pressure from outside of China (accomplished by being a bad international actor), cracked down on political rivals as soon as he got his seat, pushed the stick and carrots to all their neighbors, and has cracked down on any other possible contests to his 3rd term: (Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Tibet, Real estate moguls, Tech titans, foreign press, etcetc).""*

>**at the cost of long term detriments?**

When I speak of crackdowns I'm not speaking solely of the tech ones. Long term detriments aren't specifically within the tech realm. I personally think reigning in tech is something they could and decided to do anyways, but Xi is also using it to cement his power and 3rd term. I'm talking about the wide ranging political actions China/Xi has taken will hamper them in the future. 

* Waving the sticks at neighbors will strengthen nationalism in China, but you'll have neighbors hating you, not wanting to work with you, and collaborating against you.

* Talking a strong game and creating a confrontational stance with the US WHILE having no successor set up will mean the CCP won't risk throwing a green bamboo shoot into office and opt for Xi's experience. In the long run, the US will decouple, try to contain, and work with allies to target China.

* Cracking down on Hong Kong does the same except with the UK, US, Anglopshere, the West, and other E. Asian neighbors. They'll have recent proof that China breaks its promises and can't be trusted. Singapore, Tokyo, Taipei, and Seoul will gain favor over Hong Kong as gateways, hubs, and financial centers.

* Wrecking Jack Ma, other innovators, and the tech titan gives off the message that China doesn't want true innovation so much as stability. Cracking down on your best innovator tells your people better not to innovate or get cracked down on. Cracking down on your best companies tells your people to either join the party, lay flat, or leave if you want to innovate.

* Speaking on the last point cracking down on crypto has already pushed those miners to other places like Russian, Canada, and the US. They've taken those industries, brain talent, and money with them. This does NOTHING to help China in the long run, but might be one less factor or one less rich man with shadow money to worry about when Xi's election comes up.

* Cracking down on political rivals and shifting China away from a party-dominant authoritarian system to more of a Xi-dominant dictatorial system is bad for China because men corrupts power, men get old, and dictatorships have historically been badly run and eventually fail.

See the pattern here? Taking brash, selfish actions internationally and shooting your own innovation/economy in the foot doesn't help China in the short or long term. They are all decisions for 1 person made by 1 person with 1 person's best interest in mind.",zxc123zxc123,0,/r/investing/comments/osiost/chinas_yuan_bonds_tank_in_tandem_amid_fears_on/h6qpo1g/,0.113,0.755,0.132,0.9587

I don't go purely by standard market weighting in my employer sponsored retirement allocations & 529s. I'm active when it comes to allocations. I might go overweight if there is a long term trend in an asset class that I like. I like to increase EM but without China and Taiwan.

Maybe one day it's going to be different but if you asked me if I had more confidence in the development of India or China, there's no question. The only thing India has is it's so much lower right now, it has more room to grow.

* Brazil? Middle income trap, and screwed up in so many ways. I work with a few Brazilians, to say they aren't optimistic about their own country would be an understatement. Stock market is down over the last decade if you measure it in USD, their currency has massively depreciated, down 3x against the dollar.

* South Africa? Has a lot of problems. GDP/capita is almost 40% *lower* than it was 10 years ago. Stock market down over the last decade. And a full quarter of South Africa's market cap is basically... Tencent, it would be down even further were it not for that, Tencent has actually singlehandedly propped up the entire South African stock market. But it's Tencent so you presumably don't want that.

* Saudi Arabia? Immensely messed up place and the key industry is long term decline.

* Hong Kong- I'd actually have some time for this one, it's a great place, but it's still ""China"" and you have all the problems of CCP interference and the long-term prognosis is mixed both with the protests domestically and a slow but inexorable shift of focus across the border; places like Shenzhen are getting more focus these days, and I sort of get the impression of long decline and the central government seeing it as problematic and increasingly just, unnecessary. It's also *tiny*, it's whole reason for being is that it's China but not China, and that may not last or be so relevant much longer.

* Russia? Run by oligarchs, kleptocracy, Putin, oil and commodities, yada yada. GDP/capita down over the last decade.

* Thailand? Military dictatorship, very lackadaisical business culture, tourism is now devastated. More middle income trap.

This is already most of EM by market cap, we're down to the countries that are only 2% of VWO at this point.

Incidentally, here's the performance of the iShares country ETFs for China, India, Taiwan, Brazil, South Africa over the last decade, compared with VWO. It's certainly not China and Taiwan which you're saying causing a drag in EM, it's China and Taiwan propping up all the rest of EM.

29,EM," Ofcourse, everyone knows there's a lot of political & economic risk with EM which is why ""EM is soooo cheap"" and that's the price you pay for trying to participate in countries within the EM bucket. I don't mind that kind of diversified risk but the weightages in this case are heavily skewed towards one messed up country and its sphere of influence.  China and Taiwan together constitute >~55% of the index. 

China: 39.87%

Taiwan: 17.65%

India: 12.68%

Brazil: 6.46%

Malaysia: 1.82%

30,EM," etfdb.com and etf.com are two good sources for ETFs, they slice up this stuff. May not exactly match your fund, but it is likely in the ballpark. Any market weight EM index fund is going to have quite a chunk of China as it's by far the largest emerging market. The main difference between EM funds is whether they consider South Korea as EM, if it is included it tends to bump down the China percentage a bit, to make room for the extra Korea.

VWO doesn't include Korea but does include Taiwan. IEMG for example includes both Korea and Taiwan. When Korea is included it generally comes around third, close to Taiwan.

31,EM," The US is 55% of the *world*. China is such a big chunk of an EM index because it's an unbelievably large player for such a small pond of ""EM"". It's still only about 3.3% of global market cap.

And that's despite China being large and immensely significant on a global level, forgetting about ""EM"". If anything it's underrepresented in the larger picture.

It's big in ""EM"" only because ""EM"" is so small by market cap to start with. EM taken as a whole is still only around 12% of the world.

Taiwan is such a big chunk because it's really a developed country and arguably shouldn't be there.

But again, go look at the actual returns over the last decade, or even more, the last 20 years. Most of the EM growth over the last 20 years has come from the likes of China and Taiwan. That's the reality. You are getting this idea it's causing ""drag"" only from the very, very short term of the last few months or so (China downturn from around February this year).

TSMC is worth much more than Intel just by manufacturing other people’s chip. Intel can be one of the market leaders in this pretty easily.

I see Intel's stagnation of stock price much like Steve Ballmer's reign in Microsoft. Bing, Azure, Office 365, XBox Live Service etc extremely profitable sectors were built during his reign yet the stock stagnated.
Once Nadella came, everything started to change.

Lots of important work were done by Intel's previous CEO. But the current CEO is the one who should preferably present the importance and relevance if Intel to the world.

After all, Intel still has the highest number of talented engineers in the field and is a good place to work.

A gnat fart from the right quarter would be enough to usher in a wave of profit-taking and/or running for the hills.

The economy itself is likely to shrug off a short-term bear market and  continue growing for another year, especially if Congress manages to pass an infrastructure bill.

Politicians and officials are not taking into account the science behind the virus, its overall impact on citizens, or reasonable measures to contain it.

So you are correct when you say governors don't care --they don't. In Illinois, the goal was to wreck the state economy in order to get a pension fund bailout from the federal government. In other cases, governors simply want to hold on to emergency powers to force through radical policies, as in Minnesota.

Now the MSM and some politicians are calling for a national mask mandate, vaccine passports, and shuttered schools. Others want another complete lockdown. If those things happen, we will have massive riots in the streets, declining GDP, and more money printing.

Most countries are back on their feet after Covid, but unfortunately USA is still the #1 economy in the world and the markets tend to follow what happens over there.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19\_pandemic\_death\_rates\_by\_country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_death_rates_by_country)

The countries that had the strictest lockdown policies and mask mandates had the worst COVID-19 infection rates, hospitalization rates, and death rates. The UK was under strict lockdown until just a few weeks ago, and has been a total sh\*tshow. Clearly the policies were not working, but they kept them going

""USA fucked up badly with the Covid response""

another Democratic talking point with no basis in reality. Who developed the first effective vaccines? The US has a higher vaccination rate than places like Switzerland and Norway, and one of the highest in the world. While Europe continues to wrestle with outbreaks, our infection rates, hospitalization and death rates have been much lower. Could we have done some things better? Sure --but we did better than a lot of places.

53,BABA," These comments...I don't expect most people to know how to do a simple DCF valuation, given that most people here are obsessed with overpriced growth nonsense, but to not see value in particularly Alibaba right now is a staggering overlook of an *actually* fast-growing company seeing temporary regulatory/governmental difficulties. They don't just have fast growing *revenue* with no profits (i.e. most of American ""growth""), but fast growing profits and cash flow, with minimal debt, and well priced according to that current cash flow. Even if you just want to look at it qualitatively, this company is seeking to create an entire business and cloud infrastructure for the entire nation, much the way amazon has done here, only they're going to take full advantage of the burgeoning chinese middle class, *as well as* a focus on the massive >800 million person rural population that China has, something that Amazon has neglected to do in America, since our rural population is much smaller relative to our nation's population. I wouldn't bet against these developments if I had a working brain, but random reddit commenters can feel free to disagree because it's international, the books are cooked, and delisting a company I guess makes it go to zero. All of these contentions really just shows the skill and experience level of the people you're dealing with on here, but I digress, that's a whole different discussion.

It grinds my gears that with all of the resources available to people, you still have unbelievably stupid opinions being thrown around when it comes to valuing business. We *know* how to value business. It's very straightforward. You have a history of profits and cash flow. You have a balance sheet showing the general health of the company and how it ""deals"" with money. You want low (decreasing) debt, high (increasing) equity, high (increasing) net income, high (increasing) cash flow, valued cheaply relative to net income and cash flow, and then a high return on tangible equity. BABA has all of these, in spades.

So yeah, naturally if you're going to invest in something like this, you've got to be a contrarian. All the news is negative. The geniuses on here I guess are way more intelligent than Charlie Munger and Mohnish Pabrai, and have the historical multi-decade returns to prove it. But I want to be clear for all of the value investors out there who understand: this is exactly what it looks like when the market gives you the green light.

TL;DR I approve of BABA. As far as I'm concerned, BABA is China. If you believe in China's future growth, you're an investor in BABA. Don't listen to people on reddit.

54,DCF," These comments...I don't expect most people to know how to do a simple DCF valuation, given that most people here are obsessed with overpriced growth nonsense, but to not see value in particularly Alibaba right now is a staggering overlook of an *actually* fast-growing company seeing temporary regulatory/governmental difficulties. They don't just have fast growing *revenue* with no profits (i.e. most of American ""growth""), but fast growing profits and cash flow, with minimal debt, and well priced according to that current cash flow. Even if you just want to look at it qualitatively, this company is seeking to create an entire business and cloud infrastructure for the entire nation, much the way amazon has done here, only they're going to take full advantage of the burgeoning chinese middle class, *as well as* a focus on the massive >800 million person rural population that China has, something that Amazon has neglected to do in America, since our rural population is much smaller relative to our nation's population. I wouldn't bet against these developments if I had a working brain, but random reddit commenters can feel free to disagree because it's international, the books are cooked, and delisting a company I guess makes it go to zero. All of these contentions really just shows the skill and experience level of the people you're dealing with on here, but I digress, that's a whole different discussion.

It grinds my gears that with all of the resources available to people, you still have unbelievably stupid opinions being thrown around when it comes to valuing business. We *know* how to value business. It's very straightforward. You have a history of profits and cash flow. You have a balance sheet showing the general health of the company and how it ""deals"" with money. You want low (decreasing) debt, high (increasing) equity, high (increasing) net income, high (increasing) cash flow, valued cheaply relative to net income and cash flow, and then a high return on tangible equity. BABA has all of these, in spades.

So yeah, naturally if you're going to invest in something like this, you've got to be a contrarian. All the news is negative. The geniuses on here I guess are way more intelligent than Charlie Munger and Mohnish Pabrai, and have the historical multi-decade returns to prove it. But I want to be clear for all of the value investors out there who understand: this is exactly what it looks like when the market gives you the green light. Everything is melting down, everything is negative, all of the general public (see the comments in this thread) are bearish on the business, but (and this is the key) *the business is still doing well fundamentally*.

But just a thought, I don't think anyone disagrees with the potential for the Chinese tech companies or their fundamentals. It looks more due to the external factors affecting the company beyond their control. 

This is 1) CCP crackdown on tech companies. CCP is going after these companies for monopolistic practices. 

And 2) US government wanting to delist Chinese stocks if they do not open their books for an Audit in 3 years starting 2022.

87,GDP," The recent shutdown of Apple Daily was due to running low on funds alongside their leaders being sought after for criminal charges such as conspiring to collude with foreign countries by putting national security at risk. 

 What we hear from the west about countries around the world is always presented in a view that caters to our audience, quite often with political motives. You have to keep that in mind and always read news from around the world to get a better understanding instead of solely relying on western media. One who has a better understanding of how countries operate shouldn't be surprised by certain moves.

For example, the private education industry is a massive billions & billions of dollars industry for China. These kids from kindergarten all the way to high school prepare for the national exam to get into the top tier universities. China put national interests first because there was a growing divide from the rich & lower income to have access to these services. Add that to China's slowing down of births, they've now let ppl have multiple children while reducing one of the biggest barriers for ppl hesitant to having more kids, which was education costs. Will this drastically address fertility rates? I doubt it because one can see developing nations all over the world as the GDP rises, as ppl find more opportunities the birth date declines overall and it's consistent. But, one still has to remember that China is a developing country. There are still many second, third tier cities that are having public transportation developed, better access to jobs, etc. 

When it comes to big tech, you need to ask yourself, do you believe in data sovereignty? Do you think Facebook, google, Amazon, Microsoft should be left unchecked when it comes to what they do with our data? Or do you think user data should be safeguarded with restrictions in place for the future even if it meant these stocks took a downturn for a month? I don't think the US Govt will take the steps needed to because these companies make these politicians really rich, but as we see in China these companies are not above the rules. You want to knowingly take that risk and game the system and have monopolistic practices? Enjoy the $3bn fine. You want to rush your IPO with unsafe user data practices that puts millions of ppl at risk? Enjoy being made an example as a clear warning to every other company in China to make sure they better have their protections in place.

If you don't think BABA, the largest and most important company in China, isn't going to do everything possible to maintain its standing in the US stock market, and that it's also not going to figure a way out of the regulatory concerns, you don't know very much about the company. They *want* to follow all US financial auditing standards, and they *want* to be in good standing with their government as well.

89,BABA," There is no extra currency risk. 

Firstly- even theoretically, you don't get any currency risk buying in Hong Kong as you own the underlying company and the value of that is just denominated in whichever currency.

I.e. if you buy 100 shares in BABA, you have 100 shares in BABA. That's exactly equal to 800 shares of 9988.HK, as they are exchangeable at a 1:8 ratio.

The value of those 100/800 shares will be exactly the same no matter what happens to the currency. It will be different numbers depending on the exchange rate, but whatever happens it makes no difference if you hold the US shares or the HK shares, they will be worth the same.

This applies to the general case of buying a foreign company, you don't have any *more* currency risk buying shares denominated in a foreign currency than you do buying USD denominated ones. If you have currency risk, you have the same risk in the USD shares, because the currency risk is related to the underlying holding, not what currency the shares are denominated in.

Secondly, HKD is pegged to the US dollar, so the exchange rate doesn't actually materially change anyway.

There will be forex fees and a higher international brokerage fee buying the Hong Kong shares, but there is no currency risk.",blorg,1,/r/investing/comments/osc3ax/i_am_buying_the_china_tech_dip/h6p7e8t/,0.102,0.776,0.122,0.431
90,BABA," You have written two long and wordy  comments which ignore a few basic but extremely important pillars. If I'm being candid I would say it sounds like self masturbatory finance fantasy. Setting aside the ethics of investment in companies directly involved in genocides let's point out the things you casually sidestep.  
  
Independent accounting firms are not infallible and in the past have been accused of fraud and ethical malpractice in China, with Deloitte being the most recent example.  
  
Luckin was not a one off and to portray it  as such either betrays ignorance or a deliberate misconstrued perspective. These events are widespread and common inside of the PRC. 
  
Cooking the books, massaging numbers, manipulating figure is common place in China and is a well documented/discussed practice. In fact, China is not the only place this occurs. The likelihood of it occurring on some level in some form is much higher than not (appealing to that sense of logic you say you have). Even the Chinese government does this from the top all the way down to lower level officials.
  
Investment worthy in the case of companies like BABA extends well beyond merely business models and financials considering they're built,  fostered, and operate in collaboration with the state. Framing them merely as typical business entities is either ignorant or disingenuous (depending on you motive). Their so-called ""successful business"" should be recognized as simply   the  manifestation of a particular goal of the CCP at that particular time.  
  
Politics, or more specifically, the geopolitical aims of the CCP will trump any business goals of these companies and again, ignoring this is either ignorant or foolish.

Tesla isn't on that level. Also industries/companies have gotten better at adapting to, chasing after, and contending with innovators/disruptors. 

* Yahoo/Goog/FB dominated and wiped out all their competitive piers in advertising, communications, and data collection. AMZN the same with retail and Sears. AAPL absolutely crushed the phone market. 

* Come the next rung of disruptors like Expedia/Booking/Yelp/TripAdvisor? Disruptive, but not game breaking. Airlines, restaurants, and hotels not on their knees from these guys but from covid. GOOG/MSFT been eating at these guys for years.

* Come the current/next rung of disruptors like ABNB/UBER/LYFT/9001Fintechs? Mixed. UBER/LYFT have smashed the small and divided taxi space. They are in good position. ABNB has a solid base, but is really competing with Booking rather than truly disrupting hotels to the point where they are buying them up. Fintechs are here, but the big banks and fins seem fine ATM. I rather they don't do buybacks and dividend rises but they still feel comfy enough to do it.

* What about Netflix? It disrupted and killed Blockbuster. But now companies are on it's tail. Google has youtube and will **NEVER** leave the streaming game because it has other businesses to prop Youtube even if it never made another cent. Google will just keep chugging along with new innovations be it ads/livestream/etc and stealing what it can from Netflix. Apple with Apple TV? Same as Google. Amazon? Wish they could lose more money on Prime streaming to avoid more taxes. AT&T? Telecoms aren't going anywhere. WB will still churn out movies. HBO also packages with their internet/phones. Disney? They have enough parks and marvel movies to fund Disney+ at a loss for centuries. Comcast? They have their telecom business to back and package with their streaming. ETCETCETC. So what does this all mean? Netflix had the first mover advantage but is on the run. Streaming is still growing and disrupting other sectors like the theaters, but NFLX is on the run because the others have other business to back their streamers if it came down to price wars. Also the most concerning part is FAAAMs and BATs getting into the game because they'll NEVER be forced to exit and most likely won't choose to exit.

So back to Toyota and TSLA. TSLA is innovative and disruptive, but the auto industry have collectively thrown down the gauntlet on EVs. Industry wide, TSLA won't be like NFLX eating Blockbuster's lunch and more like NFLX going up against AT&T/NBC/Comcast. The time to design, test, build, and construct a plant for a car is longer than say a phone. That gives TSLA a solid lead, but also gives time for the incumbent autos to adapt. There's also the factor of each country's governments wanting to protect their own industrials/autos because they are looking at them as strategic resources in case of war. 

With these considerations, I don't think Toyota will become a Nokia/BB/Motorola in the phone space. If Toyota is innovative and Japan's protectionism is strong then it can end up in a PlayStation to TSLA's Xbox. If things don't work out as well, it can see loss in it's larger market share like Sony saw in it's TV/Comp/GeneralElectonics areas.

So back to Toyota and TSLA. TSLA is innovative and disruptive, but the auto industry have collectively thrown down the gauntlet on EVs. Industry wide, TSLA won't be like NFLX eating Blockbuster's lunch and more like NFLX going up against AT&T/NBC/Comcast.

There's also the factor of each country's governments wanting to protect their own industrials/autos because they are looking at them as strategic resources in case of war. 

With these considerations, I don't think Toyota will become a Nokia/BB/Motorola in the phone space.

As for the charging, it remains 'okay'. A standard Tesla supercharger will charge my car ~50% (~200km) in 20 minutes. This is obviously longer than a 5 minute gas station for 40L (500km in the Corolla), but it's also not completely atrocious and it is acceptable enough to be able to drive far distances.

So I think we're getting there. I feel just as comfortable driving my Tesla around Canada as I do my ICE at this point.

117,ICE," The price of BEV's has been consistently dropping due to rapidly falling battery prices as the technology improves. We're only a couple of years away from BEV's having the same upfront sticker price as ICE vehicles **without** government subsidies. And BEV's won't just stay the same price as ICE vehicles once that happens, they'll continue to get cheaper overtime. 

And that's ignoring a few other facts about price that make BEV's cheaper as well:

* BEV's are cheaper to fuel then ICE vehicles, even in places where electricity is more expensive and gas is cheaper.

* BEV's have less maintenance costs, since they have less moving parts, and you don't need to do things like pay for oil changes every so many months or every so many miles.

This is why I think ICE vehicles in the new car market are going to disappear a lot quicker then most people realize. Unless you have a niche case where EVs still suck come 2025 it's not going to make financial sense to pay more for an ICE vehicle that will cost more to refuel to maintain over it's lifetime.

119,ICE," EVs are just beginning obviously. Many countries have roadmaps to outlaw sales of new ICE cars. Climate change is an avoidable threat and the market is changing to reflect that.

I don't see how you could possibly bet against the EV market unless you don't believe in the future of vehicles in general.

121,ICE," It's a good question.

I've thought about that, but the answer my spouse and I agreed upon is 'no' for now.

The primary reason is sometimes we drive over the border to the US and I think I would only want to use an ICE for that for now. I also believe in diversification and for now I think having both is a good way to do that for transportation (since we heavily rely on our vehicles).",suckfail,3,/r/investing/comments/osj46p/odds_of_toyota_becoming_the_blackberrynokia_of/h6qjjl5/,0.0,0.87,0.13,0.836
122,ICE," Range isn't much of a problem in those places (really its not a problem for 99% of people even in the US).   


You can drive all the way across Germany on one charge. The typical commuter in the US drives like 20-30 miles a day, and thats even less in places like Japan and Europe. The vast majority of people will be charging at home overnight, not fighting for a few parking spots with chargers.   


For some reason people seem to think batteries need to be charged every time you drive them... No. Many of them last as long as your typical ICE car between gas fill ups. Most people could go 1-2 weeks between charges.   


Obviously that doesn't apply to the few times a year families go on road trips or for delivery drivers and over the road truckers and so on, but for the vast majority of us its just not an issue.",manofthewild07,2,/r/investing/comments/osj46p/odds_of_toyota_becoming_the_blackberrynokia_of/h6qozvw/,0.029,0.917,0.054,0.4143
123,ICE," That's more or less what I am thinking. ICE vehicles have more utility right now than electric cars, especially until there is standardization around charging stations. They are also much cheaper than electric cars.

138,TFSA," Just starting to get into investing over the past few weeks. Tons of info to process... I'm Canadian and want to get exposure to the US and CAD ETF/ INDEX market. My main question that Im having trouble getting a clear answer to is.

When you purchace a US company based ETF/INDEX fund, for ex; XSP iShares Core S&P 500 Index ETF (CAD-Hedged) on the TSX in CAD money, are you paying the withholding tax? Yes?

If so, one would ask why not just invest with Canadian ETF/Index funds on the TSX with CAD dollars all in an TFSA and avoid a lot of taxes? And I would be right to say that a lot of the time the withholding tax is a small price to pay to be involved in the US market.

Also, is it typically better when investing in US ETF/INDEX funds to do it on the TSX ie CAD dollars or the NYSE ie US dollars? Given that you try to avoid as much currency conversion fee's (ie norbert's gambit) as possible.

I also understand you can avoid withholding tax for now in an RRSP.",dasynn,1,/r/investing/comments/osj6f0/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h6qbc5e/,0.06,0.891,0.049,-0.2869

140,AMZN," First, as the other person said, your raw figures are remarkable. Obviously, a retirement in an extremely HCOL would be commensurately expensive, but you could easily churn up some massive savings only to retire somewhere more reasonable, so those big shiny numbers are nice.

Second, as to comments on your ""holdings"":

* Can't really comment on your 401k choice without knowing your other choices, but hard to argue with SPY
* Combining everything taxable/non-taxable (as I'm treating this all as geared towards long-term/retirement), you've got about $1.037m total listed there, comprised of:
    * ~$565k (~54.5%) in things reflecting some or all of the broad US market (SPY, QQQ, leveraged SPY/QQQ funds, BRKB)
    * $240k (~23%) in Apple alone! That's a *lot* to have tied to a single company, no matter how grand. If I were you (***especially*** if you're an Apple employee, such that your paycheck is already tied to Apple's financial well-being) I'd consider scaling this *way* back
    * Similar idea for $72k (6.9%) MSFT, $35k (3.4%) V, and $30k (~2.9% apiece) AMZN/FB. Really rough rule of thumb is no more than 5% in any single security, and even that is pretty heavy concentration (particularly if you account for all the MSFT/V/AMZN/FB you own through index funds anyways)
    * Seperate from specific securities, overall that's $472k (~45.5%) of your portfolio in 14 securities, themselves focused *heavily* into large-cap US tech (which you're already over-concentrated in thanks to the QQQ holdings)
* Why the random chunks of leveraged funds in the Roth IRA?

At bottom, you're all stocks (no bonds!), all US (no international!), and all/virtually all large/mega cap companies. Combine that with my notes above about being way over-concentrated into tech (including potentially overconcentrated into a handful of specific tech holdings) and I'd be a bit nervous, particularly as (I'm guessing) you are an employee in that very industry. Again, diversifying away from your paycheck makes sense, as the worst thing would be seeing the sector tumble for some long-term reason such that you (i) lose your job and (ii) see your investments plummet at the same time.

You seem to be running a very aggressive strategy which, to me, seems unnecessary.

141,MSFT," First, as the other person said, your raw figures are remarkable. Obviously, a retirement in an extremely HCOL would be commensurately expensive, but you could easily churn up some massive savings only to retire somewhere more reasonable, so those big shiny numbers are nice.

Second, as to comments on your ""holdings"":

* Can't really comment on your 401k choice without knowing your other choices, but hard to argue with SPY
* Combining everything taxable/non-taxable (as I'm treating this all as geared towards long-term/retirement), you've got about $1.037m total listed there, comprised of:
    * ~$565k (~54.5%) in things reflecting some or all of the broad US market (SPY, QQQ, leveraged SPY/QQQ funds, BRKB)
    * $240k (~23%) in Apple alone! That's a *lot* to have tied to a single company, no matter how grand. If I were you (***especially*** if you're an Apple employee, such that your paycheck is already tied to Apple's financial well-being) I'd consider scaling this *way* back
    * Similar idea for $72k (6.9%) MSFT, $35k (3.4%) V, and $30k (~2.9% apiece) AMZN/FB. Really rough rule of thumb is no more than 5% in any single security, and even that is pretty heavy concentration (particularly if you account for all the MSFT/V/AMZN/FB you own through index funds anyways)
    * Seperate from specific securities, overall that's $472k (~45.5%) of your portfolio in 14 securities, themselves focused *heavily* into large-cap US tech (which you're already over-concentrated in thanks to the QQQ holdings)
* Why the random chunks of leveraged funds in the Roth IRA?

At bottom, you're all stocks (no bonds!), all US (no international!), and all/virtually all large/mega cap companies. Combine that with my notes above about being way over-concentrated into tech (including potentially overconcentrated into a handful of specific tech holdings) and I'd be a bit nervous, particularly as (I'm guessing) you are an employee in that very industry. Again, diversifying away from your paycheck makes sense, as the worst thing would be seeing the sector tumble for some long-term reason such that you (i) lose your job and (ii) see your investments plummet at the same time.

You seem to be running a very aggressive strategy which, to me, seems unnecessary. As someone pulling in mega bucks and living beneath their means, you'll get to your retirement nut, so (again, me personally) I wouldn't be taking on all that added risks to try and chase those gains more quickly.",throwawayinvestacct,2,/r/investing/comments/osj6f0/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h6qoxyy/,0.069,0.842,0.089,0.8701

143,CD," >Can you explain some pros and cons? If I am investing myself, I’m not sure what “smaller” investments there are minus ETFs which I haven’t traded before.

The cons of an app like Acorns or Stash vs. a traditional broker tend to be fees that, although they don't seem high, kind of are. The [median Acorns account balance in 2017 was $241.13](https://www.smh.com.au/money/investing/millennial-investors-are-getting-ripped-off-by-acorns-20170907-gyckfb.html). Acorn's most basic plan charges $1/month (aka $12/year). $12/$241.13 is a roughly 5% expense that the median Acorns investor was paying the service *before* you account for the expense ratios of whatever you invested in. By contrast a large broker like Fidelity or Vanguard offers fuller services, a longer track record, and (now in particular) is available at almost any entry point ($-wise) and should be fee-free (assuming you sign up for electronic statements).

However, to your actual situation:

>This account will be used to add value to money ***we are saving for a house down payment in the next year or two***. Rather than parking my money in savings, I want a return. I don’t want anything higher than a medium risk. The less volatility the better.

Investing in the market has historically seen far better returns than savings, over the long-haul, but with significant short-term volatility. And a ""year or two"" absolutely qualifies as the short-term on this type of calendar. A [portfolio invested in the S&P500](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2000&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VFINX&allocation1_1=100) hit a local peak in October 2007 and did not return to that same level again until ~August 2012 (it got closeish in Spring 2011, admittedly). So, not that long ago, we experienced a market downturn that took 4-5 years just to return to baseline, with that portfolio losing over 50% from it's apex to it's lowest point of the downturn.

Given that, something like a CD (if you do some digging, seems like you can get around [0.6-0.7% on a 1-2 year CD](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/cds/cd-rates/)) or high-yield savings (can get [around 0.5% from a number of providers right now](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/best-high-yield-interests-savings-accounts/)) may be your best bet.
