0,DNN," I wonder if people who keep saying no to reverse splits think any company that does it will magically fall into bankruptcy or something because somehow they will find a way to complain either way. If this wasn’t announced, they would say: come on NASDAQ uplist, what’s taking so long. They would keep crying that it’s undervalued and then think they’re bag holding. 

It happens to a point where they would call it a P&D. I’ve seen it with DNN, ABML, and ALPP where people think just because it isn’t growing every week, it’s a bad stock. When really, they lack patience. And if it wasn’t clear, a reverse split was approved weeks ago where there was no way HITIF was going to uplist without it.",waitmyhonor,13,/r/pennystocks/comments/nalc4n/high_tide_hitif_announces_151_reverse_split_on/gxueddp/,0.12,0.827,0.053,-0.8393

21,RS," Basically you reduce the number of shares in circulation but increase the price. In theory the total you had remains unchanged.

RS get a lot of hate, as companies tend to do it to prevent being delisted if their share price gets too low. Usually it just causes the price to drop more as it was likely already failing due to poor fundamentals.

In HITI case they’re doing it to increase the share price so that they meet the requirement for uplisting. Which is a mixed bag. For some it’s a positive as it gets them up listed sooner and more investment can happen. Downside is investors aren’t getting that growth of stock price to the uplisting.

Fundamentals of the business are good. Personally I’m ok with the RS but I’ll be more concerned if HITI do more dillution than already announced once they uplist. As they’ll have other avenues of investment once uplisted, plus dillution tends to drop share price so they won’t want to be diluting too much.

Ultimately it’s still a growing business with good fundamentals. Whether it comes out on top in the retail weed race remains to be seen.",Narradisall,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/nalc4n/high_tide_hitif_announces_151_reverse_split_on/gxw9ofo/,0.103,0.713,0.184,0.9325

For example, I had 1420 shares. I could have added 80 to get to 1500 but that OTC fee spurred me to add  380 to spread that fee across more shares (per share cost to purchase 80 = $0.086, per share cost to purchase 380 = \~$0.018)

63,RM," It is a good question... basically, these custodianship are essentially a cheap and easy way to get a SPAC.  You take a previously public company that is now defunct and non-compliant.  Someone like George Sharp comes in and applies for a custodianship.  He then gets the company back current and able to be publicly traded.  After that, he lines up a good reverse merger candidate and does a reverse merger into the entity.

What you are looking for is a company with a low market cap that has a large number of authorized shares and small number of outstanding shares.  Preferably outstanding shares are 25% or less than the total authorized.  This is important because you need adequate treasury stock to do the reverse merger transaction.  In most cases, the RM results in the share price increasing dramatically... the smaller the market cap prior to the application for custodianship, the higher it goes.  That doesn't always happen, and there are some roadblocks that can be encountered along the way.  But that is what everyone is chasing.  These are good long shot lottery plays, not a primary investment vehicle.  Custodianships often fail and when they do, it is brutal - and that is not a dig on the custodian.  Sometimes, there are some messed up things behind the scenes that are not known about until after the custodianship is granted.  So don't bet your life savings into it.  But if you have some side money and want to make some long shot bets that have a chance to increase several fold... give it a shot.",SnidelyWhiplash1,9,/r/pennystocks/comments/na828a/bear_case_for_retc/gxt22cn/,0.054,0.799,0.147,0.9224

116,ANY," Just keep in mind DCA ONLY works based on RTM (Reversion to mean).  If something goes down and just keeps going down then DCA is just like Dr. Bernstein in his excellent book, ""Intelligent Asset Allocator"", would describe as ""throwing money down a rat hole."", i.e. catching a falling knife.

I respect Cathie Woods, but she is not doing anything any active manager hasn't tried in the past and that is excel at active management AFTER their fund gets notoriety an grows in AUM.  I am rooting for her, but this story usually ends with her UNDERperforming the reasonable index over any long period of time.  Think only 20% of active managers beat their index even after just 5 years.  She, like ANY active manager, has an uphill battle.

The point being is there is no near guarantee of RTM with any active fund INCLUDING Cathie Wood's funds.  So thinking DCA will work is not a guarantee.  It may just be catching a slow beed down (like any active fund).

117,IMO," DCA is a great strategy for the broader market indexes and mega cap stocks.  Penny stocks generally not in my opinion, but it really depends on the stock and your premise for an entry.  At the very least, I would probably eye specific areas of support or technical indicators confirming reversal rather than adding extra without a strategy.  DCA really suggests you would buy more whether it went down or up in a given amount of time.  If you find yourself averaging down mainly to see a lower loss% in your account, you're succumbing to sunk loss fallacy and not being deliberate enough with your entries IMO (not saying OP is doing this, but this is a common mentality.)  No matter when you buy, it should not be about what position you already had, rather the idea that it's a better buy than other stocks at that particular time.

The number one factor of whether a beat down stock is a bargain, is how likely the company will drop an offering while price is beat down.  Diluting at low prices makes a recovery harder to justify fundamentally, and if they issue warrants or convertible instruments, there can be capital structure issues which give shorts an edge to keep the stock price down.",stompingllama,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/nar07c/please_read_the_viability_of_dollar_cost/gxwipkq/,0.063,0.87,0.067,-0.0258

119,XL," I am a very fat dude and sometimes I go shop of Destination XL. However, once I get inside the store, I remember that the prices for everything other than their suit pants and suit jackets are absolutely sky high. I mean, the prices are ridiculously expensive. I leave without buying anything and just order my clothes from Kohls or WalMart.

This is not any prediction, but I think DXL's business would greatly increase if they could sell their everyday clothes for far less than they're charging now.",mediocrechris,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/nabiwj/the_one_penny_stock_i_own_had_a_nice_10_pop_today/gxt3ag2/,0.034,0.926,0.041,0.3797

125,ON," I don't know a ton about mining per se but I worked for a nickel mine as a student briefly.  2.44 is, iirc, not an exceptionally high grade ore.  You're gonna have to have a pretty high recovery to make it worthwhile to process that.  I know some mines in Sudbury, ON were pulling closer to 10% from pretty routine drifts, but they also had ores closer to 30%.  I feel as though you'd need access to a smelter with a pretty good recovery to actually make it worthwhile to process that. 

You may very well know more than me as my information is dated but I would be hesitant to bank on their nickel production as being a major player.  Lithium I know less about but seems like it would have greater potential.

126,DM," I HATE biotech (I'm in the medical field so go figure), but if folks are going to invest in them the very FIRST step is to go to [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov) to see if they have/ had any trials, which phase, and how far along.

Protonix has only ONE trial ever.  It is currently recruiting for Type I DM.  The estimated recruitment end date is 9/2022.  16 months from now!  This (like all biotech) are the ULTIMATE catalyst plays.  Nothing is going to really happen until that time.  If you want to invest in this or other biotech I would suggest doing it about 1 month before completion date.  Any earlier and there is an opportunity cost of your $$$ just doing nothing until results are released and/ or run up in anticipation of results being released.  Until data lock occurs NO ONE can possible know who is getting treatment or placebo.  Now once data lock is one they will then unblind and always possible insiders start getting wind if results are going to be good or not through the stats company that crunches the numbers.
