Corsair is a pretty safe stock overall.  When you look at its EV/EBITDA, Foward P/S, Foward P/E and Free Cash Flow you realize it's a solid company with not much downside.

17,DD," I think a few reasons:

First, this was a January meme stock that left a load of retail traders bag holding in the 37+ range.  Those retail traders, which didnt do great DD and think that being long means selling 6 weeks after a purchase for a 25% gain, have watched it slowly cycle between 31 and 34.5 for a few months.  I think there were a LOT of people selling today no matter what - either hoping for a pop or just out of frustration.

Secondly, big money doesnt care much about 1 earnings report.  It is just one small data point in a long thesis for the company.  Bull and bear cases on an institutional level look down the road at least 3-5 years.  In corsair, they see a low moat company with average projected growth and high margins.  Their IPO was less than a year ago so they dont have a strong history of hitting earnings targets to lean on. 
 There are a lot of questions around them being able to maintain sales and margins in the long term, and for that reason they arent going to get a 30+ p/e ratio like some growth stocks do.   

Corsair is going to have to show that its recent success is sustainable and that its growth targets are achievable for it to have long term price growth.  It's also going to have to power past a significant amount of paper handed retail traders which could slow it down further.

All that being said, I'm long Corsair as long as they grow sales and maintain margin.",RumHam1,1,/r/stocks/comments/n4mdkp/corsair_gaming_crsr_reports_record_first_quarter/gwxopxr/,0.059,0.839,0.103,0.8743

21,IT," look at today's earnings posted. it's been more than a year of the pandemic and they're growing earnings 50x times. 2020 Q1 was an onset of pandemic. by your logic you would assume everybody would buy PCs back then and not buy anything for the next 3-4 years. However, earnings for 2021 Q1 are 50 times larger than for 2020 Q1.

the company is improving margins, paying off debt, launching new products successfully, entering new (software and streaming) markets successfully, and growing with 300%+ growth rate more than a year into pandemic (when you would expect everybody to already buy their PCs and gear if they wanted due to pandemic). and they're doing it all at 30 P/E, which is a really low P/E. companies that grow that fast have 1000 P/E like Tesla or even negative P/E like Uber, Spotify, AirBnb.

btw, based on today's earnings, their P/E will soon drop to 15-20 if the price of stock doesn't pick up, which is ridiculous for an IT company (even hardware, even if it was growing 5% instead of 300%).",IndependentDatabase1,2,/r/stocks/comments/n4mdkp/corsair_gaming_crsr_reports_record_first_quarter/gwwvzi4/,0.067,0.823,0.111,0.7722

Also they sell 70% more than the same period last year. I understand the concept of of filling your warehouses with inventory you can´t sell, but it just isn´t what I see here. Corsair has been around for decades and has been and is actively expanding their product portfolio and market diversity. Sure, gaming can suffer slowdown or decrease even, but this is a bit of a moot case. I am convinced of the strength and growth of gaming and want to invest in it. If it turns out gaming is on a way down... well so be it. I´ll be fucked anyway, Corsair or otherwise.

1) I am not expecting 70-100% growth to continue, but 2020 was not an exceptional one off boom for gaming, but a huge catalyst in an already fast growing industry that won´t stop growing for decades. That is my case for gaming. Again, I can be wrong, but if I´m wrong, I have a problem outside of CRSR.

2) CRSR margins are certainly not too high or unsustainable. In fact I expect an improvement in margins going forward. They are not comparable 1-1 but LOGI net margin is about twice as high as CRSR and I expect CRSR to continue improving their margins (as they have for past year). As CRSR markets itself as a top market product, I expect them to have the ability to achieve and maintain high and higher margins.

3) CRSR´s balance sheet isn´t ideal, but it isn´t particularly bad either, and they have been improving it all the past year as well as Q1 2021 and intending to continue to pay down debt throughout 2021. Their earning guidance for 2021 and results of Q1 certainly make it possible.

In conclusion, fair valuation for CRSR is heavily dependant on what you see their potential growth as. Your case assumes no growth or weak growth. I too consider the valuation for CRSR in my worst case scenario where they don´t manage growth above nominal economic growth to be between 25-30$. I however see them continuing to grow at least 15% a year and improvement in margins, putting the fair valuation between 60-80$.",sanderudam,2,/r/stocks/comments/n4mdkp/corsair_gaming_crsr_reports_record_first_quarter/gwy0i3f/,0.107,0.696,0.198,0.9886

48,CRSR," Alright, so my portfolios biggest two positions are amazon and corsair.

I do close to literally all my shopping off amazon and quickly searched over my 10 year buying history with them. Literally only amazon made product I've bought were bedsheets. Amazon is more than happy to just have third parties sell on the site, it's where the vast majority of their retail income comes from. With very few exceptions, the products they make are cheap and of ""acceptable I guess"" quality.

Their only high quality products is stuff like kindle, which is just made to sell you other things and...Alexa I guess?

But to bring this back to gaming, I took a look at their keyboards for example. Their mechanical keyboard had 15x less reviews and reviewed considerably worse than the one model of the corsair k70. Now bear in mind that there are multiple models of the K70, on top of all the other CRSR keyboards and amazon literally just had the one mechanical keyboard option. 

For Amazon to get into this market they'd need to seriously invest in a new high quality brand, market it and slowly gain market share. Can they do that? You'd think so, but if you look at how their recent efforts have been into producing their own games, maybe not. But even if they can, the more important question is will they? They seem far more preoccupied investing in AWS and whatever else rather than physical products.",CynicalEffect,2,/r/stocks/comments/n4mdkp/corsair_gaming_crsr_reports_record_first_quarter/gwxam57/,0.026,0.853,0.121,0.9507
49,EA," >they will be 10 P/E in a year.

( X ) Doubt -- no reason to try and sell me on some bullshit, even Nintendo isn't at 10 p/e

To put 30 p/e in perspective, that's right around where some other bloated gaming stocks are that have clearly peaked. In this category we might put EA and Activision.

Do I think the p/e is going to go lower? Sure. The company's own guidance doesn't really think so, but I'm an optimist. I'm such an optimist I'll say Corsair Gaming's own finance wiz kids are wrong, and the p/e will go as low as 26 on revenue alone -- which would obviously be great. 

But 25 p/e is a hefty premium just for the word ""gaming"" in an otherwise normal hardware company.

If you have conviction that a company you're invested in is currently undervalued, you shouldn't be alarmed by day-to-day price fluctuations and should buy dips that come along the way.

118,DCF," A typical business valuation using an income approach is performed using a discounted cash flow (DCF) or direct capitalization analysis. Start there. Learn how to appraise business enterprise value. 

At a high level, you’re appraising the present value of future cash streams, including the remainder value of any assets. 

This requires you to review a company’s audited financial statements—not just analyst or commentator opinions regarding a stock. Even if the analyst did a DCF, you need to evaluate the analyst’s inputs (including weighted average cost of capital (and the inputs to building up a WACC) revenue and expenses, growth rate of revenue and expenses, etc.) to determine if you agree they are reasonable, supported assumptions. 

This is why the enthusiasm for companies like Palantir is just that—enthusiasm.

A company can have an insane amount of revenue, but if they are inefficient or have too many operating expenses, they could potentially have  little to no revenue.

166,AMD," AMD has only relatively recently obtained such growth. With regards to personal computing, Intel has led on the central processor front for decades in terms of market share, partnerships with oems, and performance. At the same time, NVIDIA has dominated the consumer/professional/gaming graphics card segment, in terms of market share, technology, and performance. 

After building my AMD based PC in 2019, started really paying attention to parts, and news regarding AMD's products. Wife was convinced to buy in at a measly 30-40 a share, IIRC. And they have since performed beyond expectations. Their consumer products do not quite make the very top in terms of overall performance, but their value proposition in consumer products has yielded high growth in terms of adoption, and they are starting to secure deals with OEMs. 

TL;DR AMD is David vs Goliath on the two most important fronts AMD has. If you can consider them a David lol. But they're accelerating in terms of development and market share.

167,AMD," My personal opinion is that most analysts and investors aren't that into electronics and tech and dont see the upcoming potential of AMD.
We saw huge impact in the CPU marked with AMDs chiplet technology and following AMDs roadmap its the plan to do the same thing in the GPU market. The upcoming RDNA3 chiplet graphics cards are said to be very, very fast and even much faster what NVidia can offer. There are some very promising leaks and the chiplet designs makes it possible to cut the time to market so AMD could probably be 3-6 monts ahead of Nvidia with even better products in the next GPU cycle.
This leads to better public recognition, probably higher prices and margins and after all higher revenue in graphics segment.

Also AMD is switching to 5nm next year when intel just try to improve its 10nm process. The 6nm APU Rembrandt and the 5nm version 1 year later will surely gain more market share in mobile and OEM market.

For me its most likely that Intel and Nvidia will loose market share to AMD and AMD will increase margins over time.

Nvidia network compute growth has almost matched it's graphics in just a couple years, so the hype is strong...AMD is kinda running out of steam after beating Intel down the last few years.  given a long enough time period, both will likely meet their price valuations and even go higher, but in a shorter term they are very risky to any market correction.

267,EVER," Sucks I didn’t play this season the best but definitely took good notes:

- Never, EVER be impatient. Even with your holdings. The market will give you a new opportunity sooner or later

- Don’t load up on your positions before earnings. It’s too volatile a time to risk it. Save your money in case they dip after so you can average down at a better price. 


- Furthermore, don’t buy a company that had killer earnings and price action for a while. Wait to see where its price settles before buying. Even large caps can get pumped and dumped. 


- If you notice an overexposure, try to deal with it during green times. It’ll hurt more t rebalance as things start taking a hit. 

- Not every dip should be bought. Sometime it’s fine to let a “discount” go.

- If a position you just bought starts tanking straight away, don’t average down right away. Give it a day or 2 to better judge its momentum.

387,DD," I think a few reasons:

First, this was a January meme stock that left a load of retail traders bag holding in the 37+ range.  Those retail traders, which didnt do great DD and think that being long means selling 6 weeks after a purchase for a 25% gain, have watched it slowly cycle between 31 and 34.5 for a few months.  I think there were a LOT of people selling today no matter what - either hoping for a pop or just out of frustration.

Secondly, big money doesnt care much about 1 earnings report.  It is just one small data point in a long thesis for the company.  Bull and bear cases on an institutional level look down the road at least 3-5 years.  In corsair, they see a low moat company with average projected growth and high margins.  their IPO was less than a year ago so they dont have a strong history of hitting earnings targets to lean on. 
 There are a lot of questions around them being able to maintain sales and margins in the long term, and for that reason they arent going to get a 30+ p/e ratio like some growth stocks do.   

Corsair is going to have to show that its recent success is sustainable and that its growth targets are achievable for it to have long term price growth.  It's also going to have to power past a significant amount of paper handed retail traders which could slow it down further.

All that being said, I'm long Corsair as long as they grow sales and maintain margin.",RumHam1,5,/r/stocks/comments/n4k6cm/rstocks_daily_discussion_technicals_tuesday_may/gwxr67u/,0.059,0.839,0.103,0.8743

397,BEST," My guess is you are 30 or younger. Your time horison is more than 20 years. Take a look back at any point in past. if you buy and hold for 20 years or more even if you were to have bought before a crash, you would doing very well.

Ex: if you bought in 2007 right before the crash (almost -40% loss in just a year),

sp500 in 2007: 1477  
sp500 in 2008: 1220   
sp500 in 2020: 2600 (+76% since 2007)

Plus you are a probably gonna keep adding to your positions as you get older. So its no problem.

I just wanted to show you this to prove that you are perfectly fine. As long as your time horizon in 15 or more, you have nothing to worry about. When you start getting close to retirement, then you need to think about transitionning into very stable/safe strategies.

412,GEO," Here is the rationale behind GEO high short interest: President Biden and the leftist push for cutting all private prisons.

I DON'T WANT TO GET POLITICAL but the reality is that sometimes public policy affects private interests strongly. This is one of those cases.

While Biden has not publicly acknowledged a desire to end for-profit prisons that I am aware of, it has been a pipe-dream of the left for some time now.

Many believe Biden will use for-profit prisons to keep the far-left happy the first time he needs to compromise with the GOP (Ex. works with GOP on taxes when the left ERUPTS he will executive order private prisons done by 2030 or some far-out date for political pacification).

Note, I am not trying to throw my opinion for/against any of these policies. I am just trying to bring some critical information on market sentiment to the post.

I will not respond to any political discussion but I will respond if there is a pertinent comment or question.

TL;DR:

Hedges are betting Biden outlaws for-profit prisons via executive action.

443,GM," CLII- I know its a spac stonk but hear me out. They are going to merge with EVgo by the end of the year. EVgo is a leader in fast charging stations. With the elec vehicle market boom going on over the next ten years. One of the biggest factors will be a charging network. When cars started getting massed produced. It was gas stations that made the difference. Gas stations multiplied and are everywhere. Plenty of car companies have come and gone. 

Gas stations will be on the way down as the electric car revolution comes. Even though there are a few good competitors for charging stations, EVgo is working in the right direction. They are working with car manufacturers and municipalities. Add in the billions they should be getting from Bidens latest approved Infrastructure bill. EVgo is now the leader of what can be a nationwide network of charging stations. They will have the ability to place charging stations anywhere. Malls to private businesses. 

I expect them to be the first to open a version of a gas station. A group of charging stations along highways with a convienience store and maybe a fast food restaurant. Once this starts, they will excel far beyond any competitor. Then become a household name. Then they win. Sort of how you xerox something instead of photostat copy. Or use a Klenex instead of a facial tissue. The brand will end up selling itself.

2. Best time to be down in value is when you are just starting out.  A 20% drop of $5,000 ($1,000) is much better than a 20% drop of $1,000,000 ($200,000). 
3. Not sure what you are investing for.  If it's retirement, no issue, just let time be your friend.  If it's not retirement, assess whether stocks are the best place (based on risk) to invest your money.  
4. Generate a plan for investing.  Why are you doing it in the first place?  What is your risk tolerance?  The Bogleheads recommend having an Investment Policy Statement (ISP) that defines goals and objectives.  Here's a link: [Investment Policy Statement](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Investment_policy_statement).

483,CCI," Vista is smashing it.  Last March this thing was a dead horse at 6 bucks then all hell broke loose .

...multiple factors contributed to the greatest run on ammo as long as I have been in the industry ..8 years now. ..national emergency with Covid, Civil Unrest, Police Brutality..looting in Santa Monica, CA of all places, Massive influx of new buyers..the list goes on. 

Obama was no match for this.  

It started March 12th 2020 and has been outrageous sales EVERY SINGLE day 417 days in a row!!!!!. Can't keep anyting in stock. Vista has a massive market share(Federal, Blazer, CCI, Speer, American Eagle and now Remington) This is THE ammo stock. They also hold the keys to primer manufacturing which is the reason we are in this mess. The primer shortage caused a backlog and then 10 million new gun buyers wanted to feed their new toys. 

Super Demand City and no Supply easy math. As far as timing..this thing still has some juice left in it I believe and that's because they've had some price increases and recently stated they are behind a billion dollars in orders.

Price Targets range from 35-49. A consensus buy across the board on most outlets.  I believe all time high was 52 and change..it has a serious shot at beating that.  I have personally spent a year watching and running with this stock.  Seriously hours daily researching this for over a year.

The negative is there is low volume to move this thing. It's insane. It has taken a big jump, but over 14 months.

The earnings probably hit 575 million in this report and might break earnings record. It was at 38 not too long ago.  I've owned this since last March at an average of 7.80. I have taken profits twice so far. I now have stock and 35 dollar calls to hit May 21st which are green and also some 40 dollar hail mary calls as well. Those could be dreamers, but I work in this field and it never ends. Phones ringing off the hook..lines all day long.  I can't and won't give you advice on what to do with your hard earned money, but I do believe this company has a serious positive short term outlook.

494,CAN," Problem is you can't be 100% sure where the highs and lows will be. If you're trading, each of the timeframes (short/medium/long term) require a different mindset and strategy. Even then, you're working off of probabilities, not definites. Trading isn't for everyone, it's a lot of stress, more stress the shorter the timeframes. Buying and holding long term in a company you believe in will give you a better night's rest at least 😂, trading can however potentially give you exponentially better ROI, but it also works the other way if you mess it up.
As an example, this past month I've managed to just over 2x my account, my bloody trading contact did a 2000%🤦🏻‍♂️(it's real, I saw the account), but that's some aggressive trading and he's really good at scalping the short time frames. I doubt I'll ever in my lifetime be able to do a 2000%. That is not the norm, but I'm saying it just to illustrate it CAN be way more profitable than long term holds, but IT IS more risky too. 

What pisses me off, I see a lot of ads/people pushing trading, but only show the gains, not losses, there's a reason why like 97% of new traders lose money. Risks are high, risk management is so important and its not something people can action properly straight off the bat, you don't always walk away with a win everyday and you need to be able to mentally deal with that without making a losing streak worse and know how to handle that situation. As well as some traders have done this year, it means nothing next year, you can lose your edge in an instant, you just need a few consecutive bad trades and you're done. 

So my advice, if you want to dabble in the trading side, play with a demo account and prove to yourself you can be profitable first. You don't try pilot a jet without getting a licence(training). Even then, portion off a portfolio between investment and trading, make your trading portfolio smaller than your investment portfolio.",DualExistence,1,/r/stocks/comments/n49f5b/im_almost_embarrassed_to_ask_this_but/gww8psu/,0.122,0.759,0.119,0.1927

506,UK," News came out yesterday that plans to ship out doses to the EU have been delayed until Q3. With most arriving in 2022. This is bad news for a couple reasons.

Because of the inevitable spread of variants, with each day that passes the original vaccine becomes less and less effective. Right now Novavax is best in class against the original virus, and pretty effective against the UK variant. Other variants, not so much. By the time the vaccine can be delivered it might already be too late to help most people and we'll be needing booster shots to supplement it. We have no idea how long it will take to make and distribute these booster shots. We've already seen Novavax struggle getting across the finish line with what should be a slam dunk, and this is just presents another stumbling block for them.

Even if the variants are not a problem there's the issue of market share. The mRNA vaccines have basically won the race at this point and everyone else is fighting for the bronze. People only need to be vaccinated once, so being late to the party is crippling for any company trying to get into the Covid space. Right now most of the world is just getting started putting needles into arms, but we've seen in America how fast things can progress once vaccine drives really ramp up. How many people will still be unvaccinated after 3-4 months?

560,GDP," You really don’t need to visit a country to understand its priorities, limits, economic strategies, and future. While expanding at a large rate the auto market is hitting all time highs but it is not sustainable. The Chinese economy is entering a fork and an impossible dilemma on continuing expansion of its middle class while sinking every single penny of GDP into infrastructure and growth. Establishing and growing the middle class takes away from GDP in a developing country whose only resource is cheap labor at cost. The middle class takes away from the labor force and adds to single minded individuals that are risks to the CCPs authority. The services market and domestic private market growth take away from Chinas ability to be the consumer goods power house that has built its economy. As credit continues to rise at unprecedented rates, housing crisis grows, rising military tensions, and historic low birth rates loom that will threaten a weakening slave the Chinese auto market is limited by the growth of the middle class and the infrastructure that continues to move toward investment of public transportation.",Mysterious----,1,/r/stocks/comments/n4bt2l/china_wants_to_build_a_306_billion_usedcar_market/gwv4u6f/,0.13,0.775,0.095,-0.8201
