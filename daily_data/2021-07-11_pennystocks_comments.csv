7,API," Hey guys,  
  
It's u/nobjos back again with this week's post. I post a similar list every week.  
  
Some FAQ’s:  
  
How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).  
  
Can I use the code/is it open source: Yes.  
  
What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.

29,DD," Technically no longer a penny stock (rose from 2 to 5USD over the last 2 weeks), NLST.

Unlike all others mentioned here, there is very very low risk, and high reward. 

Briefly- 

1. stable company, around >10 years, makes profit, makes physical tangible product used by companies like GOOGLE, has very important patents, etc. 
2. Recently won a 10-12 year patent battle, no more appeals, against 6-7 companies including google. The payout is expected to be 1-10Billion, and has not yet been priced in because the court case is still in discovery (this should conclude within 1-2 weeks, hence the large moves this past week), but there will be a payout, its just a matter of how much. The rough math is 4 dollar increase in share price per Billion (read the DD, theres plenty already posted), so there is a lot of room for movement.
3. Personal expectation is 20USD by end of year (3-4x from current price), likely 50-100USD within 2-5 years. 
4. There is a lot more information, like their products are, and will be, used in critical hardware for major electornics/serach engine/servers, and they will grow exponentially for a year or two, mainly because their hardware has been used without paying licensing fees, etc. Hence the lawsuit.

I averaged up at .12. All good prices for 3 month holds though I love all of them and am building long positions. That Atari VCS is under the radar, once people realize its potential as a pc and emulator things will get wild. Not to mention they announced they will be developing modern games, a virtual and a physical casino. There is an Atari Casino in Decentraland. The Atari token is supported by the MATIC network. These stocks also have good support at current levels mainly due to undying longs. MJWL is the only one on the high side at .18 but it did just run to .25 and their Twitter page is highly active. To the point Thurs it dipped to .12 and they tweeted ""Ones man loss is another man's gain"" Stock closed at .17 and make a quick recovery. AABB rock strong at .10 and PONGF CEO bought in at 0.42.

ZEN has been working with Canadian universities such as McMaster University, University of Guelph, UBC and University of Toronto to find commercially viable uses for Graphene.

84,CARV," CARV is still my current play. It's about 70% short by official data. I watched Ortex all of Friday and short interest only increased. After hours was super bullish. The average age of loans didn't decrease either, so the shorts that are underwater haven't covered. Brokers allow 2 to 5 days for margin calls most of the time, and I think shorts are hoping that people lose interest so that they don't have to cover to meet the margin call.

94,RSI," idk i started off with penny stocks before diving into more established companies and i ended up doing pretty well ,  Sometimes being ""thrown into the fire"" is the best way to learn! 

i think the best advice I could give to a new investor is to -

Read and absorb everything you can! Knowledge is literally power in the trading game. Use it to your advantage! 

I highly suggest doing research on Chart patterns (double bottoms, head and shoulders, triple top, etc) 

then learning different chart indicators and knowing how to use them -

Learn what the MACD and RSI indicators are
Those 2 are easy to understand and are veryyy useful when deciding what a good ""buy in"" point is. 
Like knowing what's a ""safe"" RSI level to buy in at , know about the MACD crossover, etc. 
Other indicators i suggest are the Bollinger Bands , learning how to read Pivot Points , Supertrend is useful for day trading 

I think just be careful not to buy in too high, that was something that took me a while to realize. 
Like when to buy in , and when to just hold off for a cheaper price because the RSI or MACD show the stock is being overbought at the moment and should pull back very soon


Schwab is what I use because they barely have any fees for anything on their platform and 
WeBull desktop is what i use to keep track of my stocks in watchlists and to read charts with all those indicators I mentioned, their platform is by far my favorite 

Best of luck on your new journey 🙏😁

edit : ALSO ONE MORE IMPORTANT THING!!! Don't be afraid to just cut your losses on some plays. I know we're surrounded by ""diamond hands"" and ""buy and hold"" everywhere we look. but i promise you that sometimes it's best to just cut your losses early on, and go into a different ticker. 
Rather than being stuck holding a bag that only keeps shrinking more by the day, but you're ""diamond hands"" and refuse to let go while watching ur money disappear. 
This obviously applies to very specific situations though , volatility is expected in the market so you WILL go thru periods where you see your investments go in the red ! Just trust your investment. 
If you believe in the company, stick with it. if you just followed high volume and hype you read, maybe it's time to rethink your position!",I_Eat_Booty,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/oi6udo/kind_of_a_dumb_question_but/h4u150d/,0.047,0.825,0.128,0.9816
