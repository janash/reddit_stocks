Suri was a do nothing CEO for six years. And his predecessor Elop was a trojan horse CEO - sell the mobile division to Microsoft to give them a faster dev time to market. Which failed anyway.  
Basically you have to look at Nokia as having lost a decade plus. In the public view people still think of it as a phone company.   
What people are missing is the network side of the business which makes them 1 out of 3 manufacturers.  
The other thing to consider is Nokia's transportation division. They do IOT stuff for aviation, highways, railways and maritime. USA will be doing 2-4 trillion in infrastructure. That high speed rail system Biden supports? They're going to need the stuff Nokia provides. Government Broadband? That's Nokia's Public Sector division.

99,MO," I absolutely agree, and feel like alot of people saying that black market weed is going go to out of style have no grip on the Canadian scenario. Black/grey market weed is rampant here, just not in the way you'd expect. These underground weed distributors work online, deliver weed to your doorstep in a week tops, have streamlined websites, and efficient review system and overall are almost as reliable as my local government dispensary. Speaking from experience, the quality of their product can be even better than legal weed. Not to mention that they're able to sell products (high strength edibles, concentrates, vapes etc.) that are straight up unavailable or banned depending on your province. All at rates that often rival if not defeat legal prices. Literally lookup some canadian mail order marijuana sites and subreddits to explore the depths.

&#x200B;

Theres also the huge age issue. Knowing the states, smoking age is gonna start at 21. You're gonna end up with a-lot of teenagers buying from these grey market sites with no real reason to switch once they come of age. This is almost exactly whats happening in Quebec since they raised the legal smoking age from 18 to 21.

Personally, despite all this Im very bullish on the future of weed in the US. Just not with Canadian distributors or the US weed companies that OP refers to. Tobacco companies have way more infrastructure, capital and resources to move into the weed market. The small players will be competing with these underground sellers, whereas the old players are probably gonna capture most of the casual market share.

100,THC," Black market was definitely on top at the start of legalization but the legal market has definitely been catching up. Flower prices are pretty much even now especially with covid hitting the black market prices up. Cheapest flower is 3.57/g which works out to $100 ounces which is about even with black market bulk rn but still a bit higher than previous bulk prices. Concentrates are still a little ways away but I could see them eventually becoming even. OCS for example has shatter for $50/g and rosin for 65/g at cheapest. One thing tho is that there is a large concern for many smokers about the integrity and quality of black market concentrates. I know people who have had pine resin mixed into theirs obtained from ""reputable"" black/gray markets. This alone drives people to more legal avenues. Profit margins for concentrates is also crazy high, especially for companies who have outdoor grows. Even if you bought a 15% THC ounce for $100, that's 4.2 grams THC total for $100 and if you're selling that at only $30 you're making 26% profit. Considering legal avenues it's $50/g for shatter you're looking at profit = $210 - $100 - fees",dflagella,6,/r/stocks/comments/m69kay/us_cannabis_is_my_highest_conviction_investment/gr4t8mg/,0.026,0.826,0.148,0.9753

On one hand, you have people who think big tobacco is going to come in and sweep up all of the major cannabis companies right after legalization. On the other hand, you have people who think the major US cannabis companies will become too large for buyouts at that point, and we'll see big tobacco get shut out.

I personally think the reality will be somewhere in the middle. I can definitely see some of the large US cannabis companies becoming so big by the time that federal legalization takes place that they would not be attractive acquisition targets, and will remain as standalone cannabis powerhouses, while the smaller companies get bought up. 

While I think MO is a good investment, I do not see it being a better investment right now than the leading US cannabis companies given that the tailwinds that I described in the OP will largely benefit the US cannabis companies above all others.",Tiaan,2,/r/stocks/comments/m69kay/us_cannabis_is_my_highest_conviction_investment/gr5cthh/,0.029,0.869,0.102,0.9152

Qualified dividends get taxed at favorable rates, while non-qualified or ordinary dividends are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate. The following four tables break down the current tax rates assessed on qualified dividends, depending on your taxable income and filing status in 2020 and 2021:

2020 Qualified Dividend Tax Rate	For Single Taxpayers	For Married Couples Filing Jointly	For Heads of Households
0%	Up to $40,000	Up to $80,000	Up to $56,600
15%	$40,001 to $441,450	$80,001 to $496,000	$53,601 to $469,050

126,WB," Yes and no. He's right in the sense of 10k in the S&P 500 is no more risky than 10 mil and while I love WB the dude definitely speaks from privilege of actually having billions and speaks strictly from the standpoint of wanting to retire by 65. A lot of people don't and therefore will be looking for riskier bets which yes, putting 10 mil into something super risky has way more relative risk than putting 10k into something. You can bounce back from losing 10k, gl if you lose 10 mil.

You have way more to lose with 10 mil and way more that you need to make with 10k and while putting 10mil or 10k into something stable like the S&P 500 is just as risky you have WAAAAY more downside by yoloing 10 mil over yoloing 10k and way more relative upside to 10k than you do with 10 mil(Turning 10k into 1 mil on a yolo is way more life changing than doubling your 10 mil for instance).",Nafemp,4,/r/stocks/comments/m5wsyj/why_would_i_buy_berkshire/gr3gz85/,0.128,0.734,0.138,0.6186

132,IDE," I think Unity's big appeals are:  
1) Using C# for scripting and plugins, because it's an extremely powerful programming language, yet relatively easy to use. Visual Studio is also an outstanding IDE, especially for C#, and works together with Unity rather well.  
2) It's relatively beginner friendly as you can do quite a lot in little time without having to set up too much stuff. Basic things are also more or less straightforward and there are a lot of tools built in.  
3) Once you are used to it, it's very easy to create a lot of content very fast, depending on how good you want it to be of course. 

When it comes to big projects, you want maximise your productivity and collaborate with your team as good as possible. Now while basics are not too hard, there is a lot of stuff that is neither straightforward nor convenient at all. You permanently run into issues you'd think are rather basic and be like:""I can't possibly be the first one to try and do this, can I?"", and then Unity has no (native) solution for it whatsoever, so you have to work around it or use third party stuff constantly. Or there is a way to do it, but it's way more complicated than it has to be. The UI is sometimes clunky and unintuitive as well and some things feel oddly out of place. There are a lot of tools but almost all of them lack some kind of functionality you'd expect. I'd say it's rather easy to make mistakes and sometimes you have to manually revert them because it's not done by pressing ""undo"". Moreover I can't speak for Unity's inbuilt colab-tool, but using Unity along with a standard Git client can turn into an absolute nightmare really quick. You actually have to be very careful not to mess anything up and that alone is stressful enough for me to not want to do that.  

So can Unity get better? It will require quite a bit of work if you ask me, but on the other hand they already kinda have their niche. Wanna make a AAA game? Don't use Unity. You don't?

216,DD," Yesterday my father-in-law told me he predicts (right away my red flags went up because I don't believe in timing the market) that the stock market will crash in Q3.  I knew he was just regurgitating some YouTube video he probably came across and didn't do actual DD. He then told me to sell all my shares around June or July and hold the cash, and take out everything in my wife's 401k and move it into a type of holding account to where it doesn't look like a withdrawal so it won't be taxed and we won't be penalized, but the money isn't being invested so it's safe from the market crash.  


All this sounded like horrible advice because if the market does crash in Q3, I know that my stupid brain is just going to see all that red and be happy that I get to buy more shares of all my favorites in my portfolio at a discount.    


However, I'm also a top tier moron and don't know much of anything.  So, I ask you guys, was this solid advice from my father-in-law?  As a long-term investor, should I take this suggestion seriously about selling shares and moving money out of my wife's 401k for safe keeping because he knows the stock market will crash?",EepeesJ1,3,/r/stocks/comments/m654ww/rstocks_daily_discussion_technicals_tuesday_mar/gr4psvf/,0.135,0.749,0.115,-0.6133

However, many of us recently saw a 25% or more dip in our portfolios. If you saw the same, but you held firm on your strategy and returned to within a few percent of your ATH since then, you’re getting closer. 

If you cashed out, or if you completely upended your strategy, keep your day job and keep plugging away.

Those blue chip dividend stocks are boring and slow, but they don't drop 50% in value over some random tweet in the middle of the night neither.

The COST example is due to the special dividend they offer every few years and if you zoom out you will see COST grew around 30% in 6 months, along with a lot of the market.

I just don't see the logic in that. A common example I've read about it kinda tells the same story but it falls down to taxes. But here is where I find the flaw -

The logic I see is with selling you pay taxes on the gains. Which I understand. But after you hold any kind of asset for an extended period of time your gains will far out pace your cost basis. So instead of paying taxes on 100%, you would be paying taxes on 90% when you sell. Which is less, but then you are also reducing your holding.",astheworldspins,1,/r/stocks/comments/m611jl/dividend_stocks_or_what_to_do_with_300k/gr5uu3r/,0.0,0.852,0.148,0.9581
388,WB," > Granted his BRK funds don't pay dividends, but he for sure collects them to use himself. Not comparing myself to WB by any means, but he's generally a value investor.

And BRK doesn’t pay a dividend because 

A) Buffett thinks he can reinvest the cash better than what his shareholders can do with it. 

B) It would create a tax burden on the shareholders. 

> I just don't see the logic in that. A common example I've read about it kinda tells the same story but it falls down to taxes. But here is where I find the flaw -


Ok. For simplicity sake let’s say companies trade at book value. Have the same profitability, revenue, growth rate ect. Everything is the same. 

Let’s say both companies have a share price of $10 a share. Company 1 pays a $1 dividend, while Company 2 pays no dividend. 

You own 10,000 shares of company 1, and you receive $10,000 in dividends. On the Ex-Date your share’s value drop by $1 to $9 per share, so now your portfolio is worth $90,000 in stock and $10,000 in cash before taxes. 

I own 10,000 shares of company 2. I decided I need $10,000 so I sell 1,000 shares. Now my portfolio is worth $90,000 in stock and $10,000 in cash before taxes. 

We both end up in the same place in this scenario...However I chose to create my own dividend, while you didn’t. So let’s do another example where I decided not to sell shares and factor in company growth. 

You own 10,000 shares of company 1, and you receive $10,000 in dividends. On the Ex-Date your share’s value drop by $1 to $9 per share. Your share price appreciated by $1 (now it’s back at $10 a share) between the ex and payment date, so now your portfolio is worth $100,000 in stock and $10,000 in cash before taxes. 

I own 10,000 shares of company 2. Since our companies grow at the same rate, my share price also grows to $11. Now my portfolio is worth $110,000 in stock. I have no tax liability. 

For you to come out ahead of me, you’d either have to change the ratios at which your company is traded at, or eliminate taxes. 

Here’s a non stock related example that may help, it’s not a perfect example but hopefully it’ll make more sense: 

Say you have a $100 Bill. I have 5 $20s. Before we exchange money, my cousin runs up and asks for $20 and I give it to him. Are you going to exchange your $100 for my $80? 

In this example, you’d be someone buying a stock or a stock analyst, I’d be a company, and my cousin is a shareholder getting his $20 dividend from me. This is why people say “before taxes and fees....so long as $1=$1, then there is no basis to prefer dividends over selling shares.” 

The reason why this is hard to visualize is because no two companies are exactly the same. This makes it easy to assume this phenomenon is non existent because you cannot see our company example above. But what you can see is how analysts drop the share price by the amount of the dividend on the ex-date because they know “so long as $1=$1 then the company devalued itself by the amount of the dividend.” Which then I go back to the Costco special dividend example last year. The share price tanked $10 on the ex-date because Costco devalued the company by the special dividend amount because $1=$1.",The_Texidian,1,/r/stocks/comments/m611jl/dividend_stocks_or_what_to_do_with_300k/gr6067a/,0.047,0.782,0.171,0.9974

Let's say you buy X stock at 10 and it drops to 5 and stays there for 5 years.  You could have sold at a loss in year 1 and that money, if reinvested even in a low yield CD would make more than it just sitting there doing nothing for the next 5.

You could have sold at a loss in year 1 and that money, if reinvested even in a low yield CD would make more than it just sitting there doing nothing for the next 5.

527,TTM," Get an understanding of the technical terms, as they will help you a lot when making decisions; like TTM, EPS, Dollar cost averaging, etc.

Learn how to read charts to know when you should buy, sell, and try to predict the market.  

If you see one of the stocks you have invested is doing well, then it doesn't hurt to reinvest your gains to earn more.  

Read a company's financial statements, and their news to investors to decide whether you should keep investing in that company.

Simplicity is key.  Having a lot of stocks in your portfolio at one time is very time consuming to manage; especially if most of them do not pay dividends.  

Finally investing on emotion can be harmful so try not to invest what you can't afford to lose.
