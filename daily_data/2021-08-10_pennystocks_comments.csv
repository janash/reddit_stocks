3,TWO," I'm also going to disagree on the basis that earnings has not ""crashed"" the stock for every past quarter. your data needs to be taken in context.

I'm going to exclude all quarters before the initial merger announcement, as you arguably should have done so as well, because that's completely changed the way SPRT's fair value is determined (no longer tied to it's own fundamentals, but rather the future value of the merged company)

looking at the last TWO quarters, which are the only two that are relevant, one finished relatively flat (up 3.5% on the day) and the other finished down 13%, only to rebound up 10% the following day. also, that May earnings was in the midst of a general downtrend in the stock following the initial merger announcement.

7,SPRT," well, what's changed is that SPRT's financials simply aren't relevant. if they were, the PPS wouldn't be over $7, it would probably be under $2. so imo, that invalidates your first statement.

fair enough on the second statement, if that's your approach to risk management. I do believe there's a risk that material news gets released about the merger either before any earnings, or very shortly after (especially given the flurry of SEC filings by both SPRT and GREE), but the volatility depending on timing may be too much to stomach for some people.

8,DD," A lot of these shitty penny stocks keep changing their focus. One year they're a beer company, the next a weed company, next thing you know some kind of crypto related company. They don't even seem to bother making anything seem legit because that doesn't even really matter. It's almost always a scam, and the trend is almost always the same, but people jump onto it anyway. It makes sense if it's some sort of custodianship or a legit refocus of a company, but that isn't usually the case. When I'd see overly ""optimistic"" DD posts for companies like these, I ask how OP or anyone else who is ""bullish"" on it can explain how the company transitions from one industry to something almost totally different. They don't even have a good enough explanation or more often they will just downvote. 

I'm sure most are smart enough to know what it is and play it accordingly. You hopefully get in while it's still riding up and pray the scummy whales don't do their massive sell off before you profit or the big ""catalyst"" doesn't end up exposing the fraud. Essentially you're at the mercy of the people who started the whole charade in the first place. It can work out a lot of times, but it can end badly for many too. I just hope that anyone new to pennies or someone who is greedy doesn't get burnt big time.

57,ARDS," Oh wow, great find. I hadn't seen a good comparison for JadiCell / ARDS yet.

Funnily enough, your argument makes me **MORE bullish** on TSOI, and for more than one reason. 

One, it shows that this stem cell / ARDS space isn't completely unknown. That means easier adoption for TSOI because docs know what it's about.

Two, Atherysys  is working through a fast tracked phase 2/3. Tsoi has already completed phase two and is now on Phase 3 while aiming for Emergency Use Authorization as COVID cases ramp up.

And, three, Athersys is partnered with Healios KK. If any other big pharma want to come in and compete against Healios KK in this space (which you know they do), Therapeutic Solutions International has exactly what they need: a (potentially) superior product.

And last couple bonus points. 1: you didn't see Moderna back down when Pfizer's vaccine came out. You saw competition. 2: If you had to choose for a family member between one treatment that had survival rates of 80% and another with survival rates of 96%, which one would you choose?

People that get in now are going to be very happy. People on the sidelines are seriously going to miss out. OG's are fawning over this one for a reason.

The Phase 3 trial alone is massive. JadiCells, in its stage 2 trials, had **100% survival rates** for COVID patients under age 85 on a ventilator.

You know what that means? *COVID kills by putting patients on ventilators.* Lungs get damaged, can't function well enough even with the ventilators help, then they die. JadiCells **literally heals your lungs** with Stem Cells. So all these patients dying in ICU's on ventilators? That doesn't have to be happening. This is a **REAL** and **EFFECTIVE** treatment.

btw, If you have family in this situation or you yourself are in the hospital with COVID, reach out to Theraputic Solutions and talk to your Dr. about getting JadiCells. There's a law called [Right to Try](https://www.fda.gov/patients/learn-about-expanded-access-and-other-treatment-options/right-try) that will allow you to take medication that hasn't been all the way through the FDA process. I'm keeping this in my back pocket for my Elderly AntiVax Dad...

That being said, hopefully we won't be having to use RTT for long. CEO Tim Dixon has publicly stated that they are working as fast as they can to get [Emergency Use Authorization](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization) so that everyone that needs it can get access fast. 

Needles to say, besides being great for dying patients, EUA would be huge for the pps. You know what the estimated earnings are for JadiCell COVID lung treatments? 25 billion dollars. That puts TSOI at **10$ EPS.** This is a stated goal by the CEO. This is not pie in the sky. This is real. This is achievable.

Also, phase 3 clinical trials of this magnitude are the domain of Big Pharma, which means a high probability of **imminent massive partnerships**. Like, could be this week. Could be next week. (Though, might be a bit longer.)

Last,[look at the expertise](https://therapeuticsolutionsint.com/scientific-advisory-board/).

[Look at the connections.](https://therapeuticsolutionsint.com/management/)

These people linked in the above two links are the biggest giveaways to see where we're headed. These are pros; the literal experts in their fields. Their lives are drug development and company growth. Now guess what kind of connections are available to TSOI thanks to these champions.

Oh, and this was ONLY JADICELL for the LUNGS for COVID we're talking about. Jadi can be used for lung damage of other etiology. AND [THERE's 49 OTHER PATENTS](https://therapeuticsolutionsint.com/patent-abstracts/) . A BUNCH THAT HAVE MASSIVE DRUGS TIED TO THEM JUST LIKE JADI.

Okay, I'm yelling. I can't make this any clearer. This isn't a flipper. **This is a life changer.** Buy. Hold. glty

btw, this is not trading advice. Do your DD. Make your own decision.
