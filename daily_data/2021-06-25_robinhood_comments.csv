0,TD," Welcome to buying into an IPO? How a regulatory rule (FINRA Rules 5130 and 5131 [Edit: nobody bothered to mention I had 5130 here twice?]) became a news story is beyond me...

- https://www.fidelity.com/stock-trading/faqs-ipos
  
  > As with any investment, you are free to sell the securities obtained during an IPO whenever you determine it is appropriate for you. However, if you sell within the first 15 calendar days from the start of trading in the secondary market, it will affect your ability to participate in new issue equity public offerings through Fidelity for a defined period of time.

  > You will be prevented from participating in the IPO process if you are considered a flipper. The defined period of time which you will be prevented from participating depends on how many times you have flipped shares in the past:

  > First time: 180 days
  > 
  > Second time: 365 days
  >
  > Third time: permanent ban from participating in IPO process

 - https://support.sofi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059035191-What-is-the-SoFi-IPO-Flipping-policy-

  > Members who have obtained shares/units of an IPO through SoFi and sell within the first 30 days post-IPO are considered ‚Äúflippers‚Äù and may be prevented from participating in future IPOs for 180 days upon a first violation, 365 days upon a second violation, and permanently in the event of a third violation.

  > In addition, SoFi may charge a $50 fee for the sale of securities obtained through the IPO process if the sale takes place within the first 120 days post-IPO. This fee will step down to $5 for each subsequent sale that takes place within the 120-day window.

- https://www.tdameritrade.com/retail-en_us/resources/pdf/TDA3008.pdf

  > TD Ameritrade discourages the ‚Äúflipping‚Äù of an INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING (IPO). TD Ameritrade defines ‚Äúflipping‚Äù as buying shares in an IPO 
and selling them within 30 calendar days from the date the IPO was initially publicly traded. Customers may be excluded from participation in any 
future IPOs if a pattern of selling IPO shares within 30 calendar days exists.
