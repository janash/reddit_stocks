Biotricity is currently interviewing additional sales personnel as part of a planned geographic expansion into additional states. The Company filed a 510(K) seeking FDA approval for its new Biotres Holter product on December 31, 2020 and expects the review process to run approximately four months.

Dr. Waqaas Al-Siddiq added, ""We are coming out of the gate at a full sprint in 2021, with salesforce expansion and work underway on new products that will enable us to target a much larger segment of the cardiologist patient population. We spent years developing best-in-class technology coupled with a compelling technology as a service model. We are pleased with our results and look forward to further progress in upcoming quarters.""

67,PT," > probably because you own this stock, right?

I *literally* said i bought in and explained why it wasn‚Äôt a pump.  So yes, i own the stock as i explained.

Not emotional about a stock it‚Äôs about not persuading people to dump the stock because OP says it‚Äôs forsure being dumped next week. encouraging others to share an opinion rather than say that they know exactly what is happening with the stock is not hostility, it‚Äôs trying to help a community that contains newer investors. 

Define what a pump is then if i‚Äôm avoiding it?

Edit: Ok i‚Äôll answer it. Pump: involves artificially inflating the price of an owned stock through false and misleading positive statements.

1. A direct buy at 1.505 for $75M lowered the price from 1.74 to ~1.50. After the direct offering, people were able to jump in at a greatly reduced safe price. 

2. The prior $20M offering covered ~1Y for the company. This $75M offering removes one of the small amount of risks that were originally found upon examining company potential. 

3. PT EOY is commonly agreed to be 6-8$ taking into account Mino-Lok potential in April with new funding.

76,DD," This stock does look quite promising, a really good DD.

In terms of the Indian government shutting down internet, it looks like in 2017 the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules was passed into law"" which expanded the government‚Äôs powers for surveillance and connectivity suspension, empowering it to control dissent and opposition.""

Which got me worried about this stocks future, but upon further research I found this piece of information:

"" India‚Äôs supreme court has ruled that ‚Äúindefinite internet shutdowns‚Äù are illegal, India‚Äôs government instead downgrades or ‚Äúthrottles‚Äù Kashmir‚Äôs mobile connectivity from 4G to 2G, seriously limiting what can be loaded on phones."".

From shutting down internet to simply throttling users.

The throttle is still worrying, however it seems that majority of the internet shut downs in India (which would now be throttles) were related to protests for the ""safety of the people"" which itself is still not a good thing at all but its a lot more comforting to know that the internet will *most likely* not be shut down during regular days.

From the business update calls, your amazing DD, the research I have done, all the articles about them I must say things are looking extremely good for them. Many deals, great successes, brilliant team and good future plans.

Personally, I invest quite long term (3 years +) So I am more then happy to hold this stock for a year. Thinking of going in with about $200. What about yourself OP (and other readers!)?

Edit: Another good thing that they noted in their Forth Quarter and Fiscal Year End 2020 document as that India is pushing towards bringing internet (and in some areas, better internet) to rural parts of India which would then bring a lot more individuals online which in turn could increase their subscriptions. Just something interesting!  


Edit #2: "" Availability of high-performance internet has been another major bottleneck to growth. India is a huge market with a population of nearly 1.4 billion people, but most reports suggest that less than half of them connect to the internet. Many also rely on relatively low-speed connections that are a poor fit for [streaming video.](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/media-stocks/) But the availability of capable internet connections continues to expand, and high-end connectivity is on track for dramatic growth over the next decade.""

REDWOOD CITY, CA / ACCESSWIRE / February 11, 2021 /Biotricity, Inc. (OTCQB:BTCY) (""Biotricity"" or the ""Company""), a medical diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company, is pleased to provide unaudited, preliminary financial results for its fiscal 2021 third quarter, which ended December 31, 2020. Full financial results will be posted on EDGAR on February 16, 2021. Biotricity's Q3 results continued a trend of both sequential and year over year revenue growth, with revenue setting a new quarterly record in the fiscal third quarter.

For fiscal Q3 2021, management is reporting the following highlights:

Revenue of $1 million (USD) - a milestone for Company in its quarterly results

Year-over-year quarterly revenue increased 162%

Sequential quarter-over-quarter revenue increase 34.5%

""We achieved significant growth during a period of restricted travel due to Covid, so we are even more optimistic about our growth potential as the business environment unlocks,"" stated Waqaas Al-Siddiq, CEO of Biotricity. ""Our sequential quarterly growth really illustrates the importance of our technology and model, where we are enabling a cardiologist while improving patient care. Monthly sequential growth is a sure sign that our platform is on target, and we are on track to continue our strong sequential and year over year growth.""

""During the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company experienced a gross margin of 49.2% compared to 43.6% in the preceding quarter,"" said Biotricity's CFO, John Ayanoglou. ""This improvement is consistent with our prior forecast that the cost of devices sold and other technology associated fees will become a lower percentage of revenues as sales volumes expand. We had significant product development activity during the quarter, including an FDA filing, so our net loss of $0.11 per share was higher than the net loss of $0.085 cents per share in Q2.""

In the current quarter (fiscal Q4 2021) and for the remainder of calendar 2021, the Company is guiding to continued triple-digit revenue growth on a year over year basis. With added resources from a convertible debt financing completed in January 2021, Biotricity is currently interviewing additional sales personnel as part of a planned geographic expansion into additional states. The Company filed a 510(K) seeking FDA approval for its new Biotres Holter product on December 31, 2020 and expects the review process to run approximately four months.

Dr. Waqaas Al-Siddiq added, ""We are coming out of the gate at a full sprint in 2021, with salesforce expansion and work underway on new products that will enable us to target a much larger segment of the cardiologist patient population. We spent years developing best-in-class technology coupled with a compelling technology as a service model. We are pleased with our results and look forward to further progress in upcoming quarters.",Bcl3018,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/loemy9/im_holding_agtc_obsv_and_zom_what_are_some_good/go5ek38/,0.029,0.827,0.143,0.9945

103,SHIP," When you see that in Penny land it's due to float size vs dilution. ie. IPO they had a float of 22m now the float is 68m.

In other words you take the value of the company and divide by the number of shares to get an approximate trading value. When more stock is added the value of the stock goes down to match the value of the company itself.

Make sense? Feel I may be overcomplicating things a bit.

Here's info of SHIP IPO.

212,ATOS," Painful week for me, but my largest losses were from my long term ETF holdings. 75% of my portfolio is spread out among ARK ETFs and I plan on leaving that/growing my position for years to come.

If you take ETFs out of the equation, my losses on ATOS and TNXP are balanced out by gains on CTXR, OBSV, and HEPA. My TXMD position is essentially even.

I'm essentially playing with profits here, as my portfolio as a whole is up $1800, and my 25% non-ETF investment adds up to about $1500.

Honestly, thinking long term if everything literally holds steady and goes nowhere for the rest of the year, I have a ~40% gain on the year. I could not make a single gain for the next 3 years, and most people would be happy with a 13%/yr return.

I've decided to go long on most of these pharma positions. Lots of them have a bunch of products in the pipeline, and I see the opportunity for nice growth. Of course, when I say ""long"" I really only mean a few months. Relatively few products even in phase III trials make it to market. So I plan on riding the hype up, and who can complain about a 100%+ profit, even if it's only a few hundred dollars.

213,CTXR," Painful week for me, but my largest losses were from my long term ETF holdings. 75% of my portfolio is spread out among ARK ETFs and I plan on leaving that/growing my position for years to come.

If you take ETFs out of the equation, my losses on ATOS and TNXP are balanced out by gains on CTXR, OBSV, and HEPA. My TXMD position is essentially even.

I'm essentially playing with profits here, as my portfolio as a whole is up $1800, and my 25% non-ETF investment adds up to about $1500.

Tiara may have more luck but they have a long road ahead of them and I see this progressing over the course of years. It will be incredibly costly and still may not be successful at all. 

I guess I‚Äôm saying if you‚Äôre in NVCN (which I think is incredibly risky), CTXR is comparatively a much safer play. It seems to me that you‚Äôre overlooking some really important fundamental factors and focusing on minor details.",bluelemoncows,4,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lodt68/about_ctxr_employees/go5aio4/,0.081,0.73,0.188,0.9487

258,MD," Researchers at MD Anderson came up with original idea.  But researchers do not have the money to develop the product ‚Äî So this is where private companies come in.

MD Anderson holds the patent I believe.
LM was a private company that started the original sponsoring and coordinating of studies.  As early studies looked promising there was need to move to next expensive round of studies various phases.

Lm is acquired by Citius ‚Äî Studies and research continue 

I do not have an issue with the few employees
If there business model is to develop promising bio tech that originated with academia or not for profits.
Edit to add ‚Äî when a researcher discovers something while working for an institution the institution holds the patent ‚Äî in this case MD Anderson‚Äîbut the treatment is brought to market by another company if successful.

The studies are outsourced to clinical trial drs but paid for by bio tech companies

259,TXMD," They can be.  

They let you control a large number of shares for an upfront fee.  For example, a TXMD $2.50 6/18 call is $0.53 right now.  The premium is 0.53x100, $53.  If you buy this contract, at any point before June 18 you can buy those 100 shares for $2.50.  If the stock hits $12.50 that's a thousand dollar payday for your $53 investment.  

If you never catch the stock over that price, you're out that $53.

If you own 100 shares of a stock that allows options you can be on the other side of the deal, too.",rage-fest,5,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lo8ri1/option_to_option/go4pa8u/,0.0,0.921,0.079,0.7096
