https://twitter.com/bespokeinvest/status/1641502320029495297

I'm really not joking at all when I say underestimate the inflation comps for March-June at your own risk. For 8% inflation by August to have any shot in the US at least, you're pretty much calling for 1%+ inflation reads on a MoM basis starting in April, which is not likely unless you get WTI $120+ to trade very, very quickly (and frankly I doubt it without more than this, you likely need global tensions to really fire off along with the cuts).

These comps are just LAUGHABLY impossible.

The bear case for inflation that makes a lot more sense is just that we keep getting .5 MoM reads beginning in April (as March CPI is very likely around .2).",95Daphne,2,/r/stocks/comments/129pcf4/saudi_arabia_and_opec_makes_surprise_1/jeou392/,0.102,0.854,0.044,-0.7188

Hydrogen goes BOOM so not for cars.  Wind and Solar are great, but guess what it requires.... Yep OIL to make the parts.  Then the expense to maintain.  

Any of the above sounds great and hope it happens.  Then again right now for electricity alone we are 60% fossil fuels let alone so we are FAR from that.  Most of Europe is no better (except Scandanavian countries, iceland, France, Austria, and Switzerland).

Think A LOT of it honestly started with Biden on the campaign trial saying he would absolutely hold Saudi prince legally responsible for the death of WSJ reporter.  Not a great move.  That was a reporter landmine that was BEST to avoid.  That I am sure didn't sit well with the Royal Family.  That is just an assumption on my part though.

64,ALL," Health warning, I’m not a professional, just a Redditor.

I don’t think you should *always* but it depends on a few things.

I see my cash as an asset that will grow and I will move it to the place I think it will grow the most. I have two categories. Long term growth and short term.

Recently I sold two holdings in two companies that were perfectly fine stocks, but I had lost a bit on each, a legacy of the last eighteen months. I didn’t expect any short term growth in either. I used the money to buy stock in a company I just knew was temporarily undervalued and would grow quicker short term. I was right. My strategy is to let that growth continue to happen, likely sell, then re-evaluate where that money goes at that point. It may go back to the original stocks or something else. We will see.

That money, at that time, was just more useful to me to take advantage of that specific opportunity. 

On the other hand I do have other money in stocks that are sitting, in some cases, with slight losses that I am content to hold for the moment, and likely long term. I anticipate those stocks are every bit as likely to grow as any others I could move the money to, and they anchor my portfolio in reliable stocks that I am confident in, and are unlikely to significantly crash. 

I think it’s important not to panic sell in most cases, but instead to constantly evaluate where your money is going to do the most work for you at that time. And on top of those judgements it’s important to have balance. I could conceivably have just moved ALL my money to that stock I mentioned above to reap short term rewards, but I’m also aware that my judgement is fallible, I don’t have all the facts, and events outside of my control could intervene and undermine my analysis of the short term viability of that stock. So my long term stock picks are my anchor to protect against volatility.",loobricated,1,/r/stocks/comments/128zf8p/should_you_always_hold_stocks_long_term/jemygd4/,0.038,0.801,0.161,0.9934

Personally I only have an advantage on long term predictions, because my short term bets are a crap shoot depending on the market's mood. So for me, I make more by holding stocks more than 3 years (and I been bagholiding CRSP for a while). And my reason is simple, I think I can predict technological progress better than the market, because the market is usually sus on new things and they give it too much risk.

Now, when you're investing in health stocks in particular you should be aware that they live and die by the FDA trials. Especially companies with upcoming, not yet proven drugs, they'll slide downwards for years because trial progress is usually hidden. But the day the FDA publishes trial results, if it's positive the stock can jump by 5x.

66,CRSR," I always sell any losing positions before the end of the year in which I bought them.  

In taxable accounts, this creates a tax-asset that can be used to offset either current income or future realized capital gains. If you're an American, this figure will appear on Form 1040 Schedule D of your tax return.

Usually, one sells the losing position and uses the money to purchase replacement shares in a similar but not identical investment. With ETFs or mutual funds this is a simple operation -- for instance, exchanging VTI for VOO or VV -- but with individual securities it's a little less straightforward. Since you mentioned wanting to start investing in index funds going forward, you could sell your position in CRSR and use the money to buy an index fund. The loss will then be realized, and will show up on the 1099-B your broker will send you at the beginning of the following year (again, assuming you're an American).  

A 40% loss definitely hurts, but in your position I would consider selling, realizing the tax advantage, and moving to index funds as soon as possible. After all, a position that has [lost 40% of its capital will require a 67% gain just to break even](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Percentage_gain_and_loss), and all the while you risk losing even more of your capital by maintaining the position.

72,UK," If you are a beginner like me it is important to NOT risk much. Go for safe investments and try to play woth those for now. That's what I do. 

Basics for trading: you will lose money on some of your investments. If you can't accept it, don't play the game. Another thing: most of your investments will go to lose positions often. But the market is volatile so look for possibilities. They will come back just need to hold. Most of these stocks will get strong around new year to february.

So as a new invester with limited funds you don't want to take risks. That is why you trade with stocks that pay dividends. Because even if the stock loses value it still pays you something. Look for stocks that pay dividends and look how much they pay. Usually 20-25 years time the dividents should cover your initial investment into the stock. These are the trustworthy stocks you want to use. Which are over this, those stocks are overvalued and likely.to lose value or used like gold, emergency stocks. If a stock covers its investment with dividend in a shorter period they are undervalued for some reason. Might be risky to invest.

Do NOT trade with more leverage than you have. Not your game. Do NOT invest coins they are worthless. Go for US, German, French, UK, Japanese stocks, these are likely known by you as well. Invest in companies you trust. Do NOT invest more than 5% of your leverage into 1 stock.

If you do it for a few years you can grow some experience to go on regular, non paying stocks. But it is usually not advised for people who are not okay losing everything.

For those genuinely interested in investing in Nintendo I would recommend this excellent write-up by an American investment group called Crossroads Capital. It’s a 100 pages long but it’s an excellent read and suitably in-depth for anyone considering deploying their hard-earned capital.

94,AI," As I understand it was the previous president Mr. Iwata(my favorite CEO) who oversaw both the development of the Wii U and Switch. With his tragic passing it's hard to say what direction Nintendo will go in with their next console.

They could easily get away with just putting out a beefyer Switch, calling it New Switch (please not that name Nintendo), and it would probably sell out. But that's not what the company is. They like innovating and finding ways to use emerging technology to have fun. Throughout the course of video game history that's been true. Shoulder buttons, handheld portable console, Analogue sticks, motion control, hybrid consoles. They've constantly been trend setters in an industry usually playing catch up to them (see Steam Deck).

As I understand Nintendo has made huge investments into the development of AI. That might have positive impacts on the quality of their games in the future if they can incorporate human like AI into their games.",XNoob_SmokeX,1,/r/stocks/comments/129qube/your_opinion_on_ntdoy_as_a_value_stock/jeoql7a/,0.018,0.824,0.158,0.9781
95,IP," I hold nintendo. I think they’re a great company. They don’t rush things to market, as you can see by the delay of many games. They want to get it right. This results in better products, and a better experience. They innovate on the gaming industry regularly. Everyone is either a playstation and switch or PC and switch gamer. They started as a trading card company a hundred years ago, and have kept up with the times as they’ve changed. Their IP is the disney of video games. I think will hold Nintendo forever.",awwfishsticks,2,/r/stocks/comments/129qube/your_opinion_on_ntdoy_as_a_value_stock/jep2f70/,0.024,0.827,0.149,0.9022

97,TV," You’re blindly rotating and your mindset is that of a trader while you utilize none of the tools of a successful trader. This is why retail loses. The fact you’re watching TV to make decisions is what causes you to lose. The information on CNBC is literally garbage. I never ever listen to those idiots but honestly what you’re attempting is worse than that. 

It’s a miracle you’re up at all but thankfully everything is rallying so you’re pretty lucky. 

You’re holding onto time bombs and the saddest part is you don’t even know it. Your risk management doesn’t exist. Your research is shit. And your portfolio is massive at 25 stocks. If I pointed at a random stock in your portfolio you probably can’t even tell me the top line or a market cap.

My recommendation? Stop watching TV for stock tips. Stop buying so many companies. And either do real research or just buy the S&P index and do something else productive with your time.",Atriev,1,/r/stocks/comments/129es0s/i_was_only_up_15_for_the_first_quarter_of_the/jenxe9p/,0.133,0.734,0.133,0.2531
98,CP," There's nothing wrong with owning 3-10. I have more. It helps that not every company needs constant supervision. 

For example, I own CP railroad. My thesis is that railroads are vitally important monopolies with high ROE. That's basically been the thesis for 160 years. I don't feel the need to read every report in depth, unless there's some specific news.",creemeeseason,5,/r/stocks/comments/129es0s/i_was_only_up_15_for_the_first_quarter_of_the/jenjmvj/,0.0,0.85,0.15,0.8091
