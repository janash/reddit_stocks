19,CCIV," Mine really depends on my investment level and what my expectations are for that investment.  I'll give some examples below

So my wife and I bought into Doge at the beginning of the year, not alot just like $300 all together.  Once our investment hit $600 we pulled out $300 (our initial investment).  After that we pulled 50% periodically, Everytime the value hit $500 we pulled half.  We did that 4 times before it crashed and we exited our position.

CCIV I invested in at 18 and sold at 24.  I sold at 24 because I felt I have achieved enough profit and I think it'll dip back down to 20 in the future, but if it doesn't I still made a profit; I currently feel like I can make higher returns elsewhere with that capital.

JSDA is a position I currently own and Im currently up around 6% on it.  I could sell and move that capital but the company is sentimental to me,  along with some good new recently (expanding more into Kroger, Walmart, Sam's club) so I'm holding it for the long term to see what happens.

So for me I guess it really just depends on the stock and what I think may happen with it.  If something suddenly spikes I'll generally pull my initial investment hold, or exit entirely If I feel the capital is better deployed somewhere else.",blakedaugherty2,2,/r/investing/comments/nwe3qn/does_anyone_just_take_profit_at_certain/h18sr49/,0.018,0.903,0.078,0.9316

23,IMO," IMO, when to get out is one of the hardest things.  I find I'm usually early getting out (and early getting in for that matter) because I'm shit at dealing with the anxiety of holding something I think should be going down, even if it's currently going up.    And when things go down, they tend to go down pretty fast, and I'll always interpret a random down day negatively if I'm already in that mindset.  

I think what I should be doing is just setting stop losses and forgetting about it.  However, what I usually do is look for someplace else that I think looks like an opportunity -- then I'm just moving money from one asset to another, which is a nice, forward-looking feeling.  Then I prioritize what to sell based on my opinion of future prospects, not how much I've made or lost.  So for instance, I've divested of some small growth stocks carrying debt because the inflation numbers out today will probably hit them hardest.

It's kinda chickenshit trading. It practically halves profits in an extended bull market and softens losses in a bear market, but it still churns out a small ongoing profit when there's long term sideways movement, as long as there's enough volatility day to day.

I backtested various percentages taking trading fees into account, and found the sweet spots for my setup specifically on TSLA were at 13% and 8%.

34,UK," MPT isn't a strategy to beat the market. In fact, it is the opposite: MPT assumes a linear relationship between risk and return. The premise of active management is the opposite.

Wealth managers have a habit of saying this kind of thing. Saying that you do ""Modern Portfolio Theory"" sounds very advanced...but that just indicates that you don't really understand what MPT is...you are just using an acronym to hide your ignorance.

Also, if we assume that this firm actually understands MPT, this approach is about five decades old, and has more theoretical than practical significance. MPT-optimal portfolios will generally underperform the market index because of estimation errors. Academics like to pretend that MPT is something significant because it makes their job less pointless. But all MPT says is really that IF you can measure risk and future return perfectly then you can construct the optimal portfolio. The slight issue is that no-one can predict risk or future return with certainty (and the most common methods of applying MPT result in estimation errors and poorly-performing/non-sensical portfolios).

Finally, no-one should be promising a certain return. Great, the S&P500 has done whatever in the past. That does not mean it will do so in the future. The stock market can do nothing for five decades, it can go to zero, etc. The long-term real rate of return for equities is \~3%, maybe lower if risk premiums fall further. You can control this with diversification, you cannot control this with MPT, you cannot promise a certain level of returns because no-one knows what they will be (it is easier to predict relative returns than absolute returns).

EDIT: I will add, I used to work in this business. Generally speaking, you aren't going to get a good service with investable assets below $5m. I am in the UK, not US, but this is my experience. Asset allocation is very hard: this means that you will struggle to do it correctly alone BUT it also means that most of the people you hire won't be able to do it either. If you have moderate levels of common sense (i.e. you won't try to yeet your money into individual stocks) then it is just easier to do it yourself.",bananarepubliccat,6,/r/investing/comments/nwpn80/modern_portfolio_theory_vs_buy_hold_of_sp500/h1avpi4/,0.075,0.801,0.123,0.9748
35,MDT," As many have said, a 1% annual fee is a complete scam if they are roughly bringing in the same returns as the S&P 500. However, I would like to share arguments that support both for and against the Modern Portfolio Theory.

A fundamental thesis in statistics is as follows:

>""All models are wrong, but some are useful"" - George Box

**Against MDT:**

\- We will look at S&P Global's Persistence Scorecard, which can be found [here](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/spiva/article/us-persistence-scorecard). This scorecard measures the consistency of performance between a variety of funds (actively or passively managed, consisting of various asset classes and style focuses). At a glance, we can see that although in the shorter term, there has been funds that have outperformed the index, they are unlikely to do so in the longer term.

>Compared to previous years, active fund persistence somewhat improved in 2020.  For example, 64.5% of domestic equity funds in the top half of the distribution for 2018 continued in the top half in 2019, and 55.0% repeated that feat in 2020.  At first glance, this lends some credence to the idea of persistent outperformance (see Report 1).

However, rewind the clock two years, and of the top-half funds of 2016, 21.4% repeated that accomplishment in 2017, with just 4.8% ranking in the top half each year through 2020.  This rate is lower than what random chance would predict (see Exhibit 1 and Report 2).

Another point they have mentioned, that out of all the top 5-year performing funds back in 2016, just 1.5% of those funds managed to stay at the top in 2020. They give a lot of information and I highly recommend many people to look this report over, as they compare the performance of hundreds of funds, and is done every year.

The takeaway we have is that this is just an argument for index-investing, as it is also recommended by many of the top investors of our time.

\- Many of the MDT services come with a hefty annual fee. One percent may not seem like a lot at face value, but you need to take into account that the average return is, just an average. The fee is how much they according to the size in your account. For example, if you had $10,000, and a certain year has been quite underperforming, they still take that cut from your account. If the fund were to drop 30% in any given year, you would be losing more than 30%, as the fund manager takes a hefty cut.

\- MDT services gives the assumption that they will on average give you a certain return. However, the index average is calculated based on historical returns. These numbers will continue to change as time passes. And as these numbers change, they will deviate away or towards each other. Meaning, past performance does not dictate future performance, however, it remains factual that the S&P 500 has continued to prevail over time.

\- This is not actually a point, but **my** ***(opinion)*** argument for financial stability and against MDT. (remember these bullet points are only my personal opinion)

* If you are in a situation where you need more safety than risk, than index investing is the more optimal choice. The S&P 500 has generally have grown over several decades with some pullbacks (both minor and major) in between. In my belief, as long as capitalism plays a role in the U.S economy, the index will continue to strive IN THE LONG TERM.
* If you simply do not have the time, and is skeptical of others' research, then index investing is more optimal. It puts you at ease of trust in others as well as it does not require you to put in much time to do.
* It poses as a big financial liability. Lets say you hate your 9-5, that it has terrible work/life balance and the pay is (some derogatory term), and overall, does not cover your cost of living, then MDT is **NOT** for you, as appetizing as these returns may seem. Why? Because it can be a huge financial liability. You have a family (maybe you don't), you have bills, financial responsibilities, etc, having more financial liability (such as the variance of performance with MDT) can cost you greater harm than good, and it is up to you to decide whether or not these risks are worth it. (I don't think its worth it but to each of their own.)

**For MDT:**

\- Diversity is key, the index itself is diversified. The S&P 500 measures the 500 biggest companies by weight of market capitalization. This accounts for many different sectors and industries. You can continue to diversify (MDT) with other indexes, international indexes and real estate.

\- You may have more knowledge in one area. The expertise you may have in, lets say, real estate, can be leveraged for your own gain. With MDT, you are finding out a asset allocation that you are comfortable with. If you have expertise in real estate, it is completely within your comfort zone to have more weight in real estate, and that is okay. Use your strengths for your benefit.

\- There is more than one way to achieve a successful investment portfolio. Whether that be real estate, traditional markets, cryptocurrency, royalties, etc. Like many nutritional diets, you may consume things you are not comfortable with consuming, but it is beneficial for your overall and long term health. In investments, it is a good idea to have your money placed in various different asset classes to reduce financial liability towards a single industry. Now, this doesn't mean you should buy a service, I still think index investing is better than that 9% return for 1% fee, but there are more ways to do MDT than just that.

\- If you have the financial cushion to afford MDT. Unfortunately, it is true that it takes money to make money. In my opinion of against MDT, I have an opinion for it. If you have a sustainable career and you enjoy it, allocate the funds that sit outside of your cost of living into investments. You already have a financial cushion that lets you afford your cost of living. This means that if you want, you can have some risky investments, such as MDT's, index investing, cryptocurrencies, real estate, etc. Now this would be an ideal situation that most people do not, but even the most comfortable people still take more financial risk than they can afford to.

36,JPM," 9% seems very achievable until you buy JPM in a dip and watch that near-term gain evaporate.  


Sorry, just in a mood. Basically, I think you can throw a dart at the board and land on 9% these days.  


ABBV's current dividend growth rate means anything bought today will return 9% after 3 years of growth. (If that is sustained, and probably will be).  


MO's dividend starts at 6.84% and will double within 10 years.  


So basically, 9% just isn't enough these days, that's a very low ball in my estimation.",DarthTrader357,1,/r/investing/comments/nwpn80/modern_portfolio_theory_vs_buy_hold_of_sp500/h1b2osz/,0.039,0.841,0.119,0.8176

I bought shares at $5.75 and sold at $8.00 - but share price certainly has the ability to creep up again if the product catches on - nationwide there are about 400 police outfits who have this thing and alot of cops think it's useful/like it. - Which means there are 0.8 Million other police officers who should buy one\*(more likely get issued one from the force) within the next 5 years\*(Not to mention the other law enforcement types, FBI, CIA, NCIS, Border patrol, military police, who knows they could sell 2 Million if this became a ""must have"" police equipment)...... This product's moat for sales is wide. 

I don't know about the fundamentals or the technicals on this particular stock. i just think the product is really cool and if it did become standard issue - it would sell 800,000+ products in a few years.

83,SSPK," Just posted this as a response to another question:

I'm very pro pot but cannabis investments have not been very significant because I think there's still real obstacles - it's very much a commodity product that can be considerably impacted by overproduction (Canada produced as if everyone was going to get high 24/7/365 and wound up with mountains of unused weed) and the illegal market is still significant. What are the implications of interstate commerce if it went broadly legal?

Maybe it's just me but I think the novelty factor is also considerable in weed with the increasingly long list of different strains in a way that alcohol isn't - I think it's going to be a little harder to create brand loyalty. It's probably going to be easier to create brand disloyalty if a grower is offering crap/inconsistent product. A dispensary chain/MSO might at least create some degree of loyalty if their employees are knowledgeable and particularly if they have a good rewards program. Lets say I like a strain and I walk into a dispensary and there's 50 other strains that I might react to in varying ways. Do I buy more of the favorite or am I tempted to try other things to see if there's a new favorite? If I'm choosing alcohol I'm choosing taste but ultimately drunk is drunk. If I'm looking at weed, do I want something more uplifting, more sedating, etc. Look at Leafly and the detail that some of those reviews go into on the specific experience to a specific strain.

Additionally, I think for a long time it was hard to find something with management that I felt confident in. I don't have any interest in the pure play growers - I have very small positions in a few MSOs (the limited shelves to sell the product more appealing than people who are entirely focused on growing it), as well as SSPK (the Weedmaps SPAC.) MSOs to me have been a more appealing business than the pure play growers (although not without concerns either) and Weedmaps is something that appealed from a standpoint that it's basically Grubhub/Yelp for weed.

So I do think that weed will be a theme but people have been investing and allocating to it like everything weed related is going to be a fantastic long-term investment (and hype can certainly get stocks ahead of themselves - look at weed a few years ago before all those names cratered) and I just don't see it. So for me, it's been trying to find things that I'm long-term comfortable with owning and having an allocation (which in this case remains very small) that I'm comfortable with. For me, things like e-commerce and payments/fintech (and enterprise software, high end luxury and a bunch of other things) have more significant % allocations. My allocation to weed may change over time depending on how things go but I can't see it changing for the foreseeable future.

TLDR: I think pot will certainly be a theme in the years ahead but broadly I don't see it as this sort of ""straight path to moon"" that others seem to.",dvdmovie1,10,/r/investing/comments/nwizuv/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h19yy1f/,0.064,0.775,0.161,0.9958

122,MO," Very few of these pot upstarts will be able to compete with Altria, if the market in at least most states (or the most important states) is somewhat free. If too many regulators pull some kind of ""Equity"" push then who knows. But then Altria has the money to challenge ""Equity"" regulations on the grounds that it violates the Equal Protection Clause or whatever else their lawyers come up with.  Either way, my gut tells me Snoop Dogg is the celebrity who has the best chance to really hit it big with this pot stuff. And at the end of the day the pot is merely a bonus, a reason to think MO might become a ""meme"" stock.  If it remains what it is then I'm still happy.",Sweaty-Jackfruit,1,/r/investing/comments/nwizuv/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h1axtt6/,0.031,0.809,0.16,0.9562
123,MO," I'm really not sure what you are basing that on. The US upstarts are, for the most part, quite healthy fiscally, aren't tethered to a dividend, and have only improvement as far as regulatory and market conditions go. Not to mention subject matter expertise in what they are doing. These aren't meme businesses. I am far more comfortable in their ability to compete in a growing industry and improving regulatory environment than I am in a company that has been slowly decaying for 30 years, who also stands to gain the least fiscally from any move towards decriminalization or legalization as MO is not cut off from capital markets or paying insanely high interest rates for debt right now.",Joeyjoejoejabadu,2,/r/investing/comments/nwizuv/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h1ayisi/,0.055,0.751,0.193,0.9479
124,MO," Look, I can see you are wedded to this investment thesis in marijuana, but I think it is likely you are going to be disappointed. Cronos is a Canadian marijuana company that isn't doing very well, like most in the Canadian market, and is itself dependent on acquisitions to improve its operating position. Cronos also doesn't have a presence in the United States right now.... so their entry into the US market in terms of exports to the US is contingent upon *legalization*, which is a much taller order than *decriminalization* given the political environment. Short of that, an Altria-Cronos consortium would have to stand up production operations in the United States from scratch.

Another point I keep making, that you keep ignoring, is that Altria's cash flow is largely committed to the dividend, and that is really the whole point of the company. They have focused on making it a cash cow. It is good at that. However, they are committing 80% of their EPS to servicing and growing that dividend. To finance growth in a new sector with lots of competition from nothing will require a lot of money. Cronos is hemorrhaging money right now as it is, so it isn't coming from there. Altria will need to cut its dividend and change its entire orientation as a business to do this effectively. Given that investors are not in MO for growth, that will be a very tough sell.

Finally, saying that Altria's shareholders have done ""pretty well"" over the years really depends on what you are looking at. While the dividend has continued to increase somewhat in absolute terms and its dividend yield has really increased, that is in large part due to the decline of the stock price, which has been substantial, and the commitment of management to return cash flow to investors over growth. Once again, if you are looking for income, it isn't a bad place to go, but it has fit the definition of a ""dividend trap"" these last few years. Unless and until it can demonstrate an ability to grow its market, instead of just squeezing more profit and revenue out of a declining customer base, betting on it as a growth story strikes me as playing against the odds.",Joeyjoejoejabadu,1,/r/investing/comments/nwizuv/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h1b3s0w/,0.055,0.763,0.182,0.9951

137,IBKR," I'm 24 years old from Southeast Asia (Thailand)

A few months back I was asking here while I was fully invested locally at home. I was encouraged to diversify by you all, and I actually managed open an IBKR account. $4,000 split into 4 ETFs (small cap/small cap value, and tech ETF). I'd like to thank you for encouraging me to take the extra step. (It was quite a lengthy process due to my country making owning foreign equity illegal without the central bank permission, it was exhausting for the 23 year old me)

My next question is that I'm concerned on how much should I keep my investment at home. I know Thailand isn't the most optimal place to invest, but having money close at home provides me comfort. I'm not sure how would I approach portfolio balancing from there. Is 66% foreign 33% local allocation, a bit too concentrated?

Currently my total portfolio combined is around $23,000+ (THB 720,000+). $4k is in the US, and the rest is in Thai stocks. I'm planning to move $6,000 more to IBKR this year and put it into VOO/VT and maybe some fancy sector ETF. I don't plan to hold stocks because I want to sleep at night (the market opens at 9pm here haha).",timemon,4,/r/investing/comments/nwiz5h/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h1acusm/,0.038,0.896,0.065,0.571

152,ATH," So a few months ago I decided to do an internal transfer of my Roth to rejigger what I was invested in for the long haul.

I had some thoughts about how I wanted to reapportion things, but I figured ""hell we're at ATHs, things make less and less sense on the daily, I'll just transfer into cash reserve and think it over for a month.""

Well, it's been nearly four months and I find myself paralyzed into inaction. The ATH just keeps rising - the mania keeps on crescendoing - the money printers keep on printing - all while the seams of US society, culturally and climactically, continue to fray. 

I keep considering different allocations of Vanguard funds/ETFs, and invariably feel they're all crazy overbought - as is the case for basically every major individual equity, at least by traditional metrics. 

A correction feels inevitable - even the most bullish bulls can taste the soap this bubble is so big - moreover, the longer it's delayed the deeper the fall is likely to be - but if timing is tough in normal times, extraordinarily weird financial times make it extraordinarily difficult to make any guesses as to when (or God help me, if?!) the bubble will pop.

Meanwhile, although I continue to dollar cost average weekly into vanguards 2055 retirement fund, everything I invested over the last astounding decade, and all the gains of that decade, are currently sitting in cash, losing, according to uncle Sam, 5% in value in just the last month.

 Obviously that's bad - but the alternative is dumping it into what appears to be the mother of all bubbles...

What is a homie supposed to do? Just seems like dollar cost averaging ain't gonna cut it when this thing implodes...

I'm mid thirties, employed, and perpetually fiscally unnerved. Mostly I'm just kvetching.

* Employed, $170k, combined with wife ~$210k/year (Salary, not a sales/bonus based income)
* For retirement/security, and potentially any other sort good ways to diversify
* Would want the money in 15-25 years

Investments:

* Prefer fairly safe investments
* Fidelity 401k, currently contributing the maximum amount, currently have about ~$55k in it

Debts:

* House has ~$170k left on it (paid $220k, comparables in our neighborhood are selling for 300k+ now but we'd just be overpaying to move somewhere else as well lol), no PMI, something like a 3% interest rate (don't have it off hand)
* One car paid off, other car has $11k left on it, amortization puts it at about $700 left in interest sooo not too worried about trying to get rid of that early

Monthly expenses are stupid low, we live in a low property tax area as well.

Not carrying any credit card debt or student loan, CCs paid in full each month. Have approximately $70k in a checking account (dumb, I know) and it keeps filling up faster than we spend it. Our income has roughly tripled in the past three years and our lifestyle has not caught up yet, and we're trying to avoid letting it catch up (ie. driving our Toyotas still instead of upgrading, as tempting as that has been - even test drove some BMWs before deciding that was silly) both to save for retirement and just because we feel safer this way.

From a basic level of research, I would have to do a backdoor Roth IRA. Is that the best place to start, and should I just dump everything I'm willing to invest into that? So if I wanted to say - invest $40k now - take that from my checking account, put it into a traditional IRA, convert to a Roth IRA, then just be aware of the taxes for 2021?

154,GDP," If you are a long term investor (don't need the money for, say, 10 years or more), then the home country / foreign balance probably resolves to ""where are the best returns?""  I would look for Thailand GDP as a percentage of world GDP as a starting point.  Then, consider tweaking the allocation based on GDP growth estimates.  If Thailand is estimated to grow more than the rest of world, allocate more to your home country.  

You have a solid edge for investing in your home country - you speak the language, receive relevant news, hear rumors, and can see success / failure on the ground.  This suggests that you can build the skills to pick Thai stocks and perform better than a Thai index / ETF.  Consider putting your Thai portion into individual stocks that you think will do well.  

Similarly, you probably will not know more about Google than an active investor located in Silicon Valley.  The same principle goes for any international stock.  I would consider holding foreign companies as index ETFs.  You don't have to be right on specific stocks, you just take the average return (which is still very good).

So by going for Vanguard you're able to flexibly move the money between each of their offers without incurring additional fees.  


Ask a financial advisor to elaborate on that. But, I'd go for the flexibility to move around in Vanguard, rather than lock into say....RGAGX or RWMGX and not really have much options to rebalance.  


Of course all of that may be obliterated by restrictions on the 403b that I'm not familiar with.

ATR is a feature of your trading platform ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atr.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atr.asp)) Average true range.  


What it represents is the likely volatility. You want a Stop that never actually gets hit but is within your risk tolerance. Obviously a stop of 100% loss is never going to get hit but is that your real downside risk tolerance?  


So a professional trader's tolerance will be around 2% of loss. So your ATR should be within that range or it's getting risky.

Market Cap($ price of share multiplied by # of shares) is how much the shareholders think the company is worth sometime in the future.  I.e. when you buy BRK.B you are buying future cash flow.

BRK is a touch confusing because they have 2 stock tickers, BRK.A and BRK.B, except nobody can afford BRK.A shares anymore and generally just get turned into BRK for B shares.

But anyways.  using your numbers(and not accounting for anything like debt, etc):

875B in assets, and roughly 300B in invested stocks of 3rd party companies.

    300 Billion / 875 Billion = 0.3429

so roughly 34% of the assets are in 3rd party companies.

184,IRS," US ETFs/mutual funds can't legally reinvest dividends, other than temporarily, until their distribution date. They must pay them out. You can reinvest through DRIP, but this doesn't change the classification of the dividend for tax purposes, in this case, you still need to pay tax on the dividend at the point it is reinvested. This is a requirement for their tax status, they don't have to pay corporation tax.

The only way you can get around this is where it's not structured as a fund but rather a regular corporation- this is what Berkshire is, and why it can receive dividends but not pay them out to investors. The trade-off of this structure is that Berkshire needs to pay corporation tax.

European UCITS ETFs can reinvest (accumulating ETF) but how this is actually treated depends on your specific country. Some tax it immediately, some don't, some it makes no difference to the tax regime whether it's accumulating or distributing, they treat it the same. If you are a US person this probably doesn't make sense anyway, I believe there are some major negatives to investing in non-US investment funds (Passive Foreign Investment Companies/PFICs) for US persons.

As such- the only way you can really avoid dividends in an ETF, is to pick an ETF that primarily holds companies that don't pay a dividend. Stuff like tech or growth ETFs, because these companies are less likely to pay dividends. QQQ has a dividend yield of 0.53%, for example.

I am a non-US person but face this same issue, I am not liable to US capital gains (and don't have local capital gains either) but I do have to pay the IRS for dividends (15%). So I have thought about it. But I don't feel the amount of the taxation is so great that it makes sense to specifically try to build a portfolio around avoiding dividends, I just ignore it really and primarily just hold the whole market- which doesn't have that high a dividend yield. I would actively avoid holding things like REITs that have to pay out basically all their return as dividend.",blorg,5,/r/investing/comments/nwp5ky/large_cap_etfs_or_diversified_equities_that_dont/h1aenee/,0.082,0.838,0.08,0.8475

This is probably it. I don't see the purpose of going way out of your way to avoid tax unless you're paying a ton of it. First and foremost is making good investments rather than shifting your investments around to minimize/reduce tax. I think France takes like 15-20% off my dividends from my LVMUY but I've literally 4-5x just holding that stock (not including the dividend). Reminder that Uncle Sam doesn't tax you unless you're making money and *only* on the profits.

With that said, OP could be completely YOLO/stupid/risky and park all his cash into leveraged ETFs like TQQQ which usually never pay dividend and is largely """"""growth"""""""", but even then TQQQ (average >0.01%) and QQQ (0.53%) both don't pay much in dividends. Even the SPY pays which pays a WHOPPING 1.33% on $1,000,000 would only pay $13300 in dividends which would be a killer $1995 if we're applying at 15% tax.

191,ALL," Right.

TMF is 3x levered TLT basically.  It's a much scarier ride than something like TLT.  Treasuries in general are not expected to do well in the next decade.  Rising interest rates == bad treasury yields.

> Do I understand correctly that these strategies would prove disastrous in a year in which rates rise (and bond prices fall) and equities also fall? 

Well, maybe.  Treasuries are usually negatively correlated with equities, i.e. when equities do terribly, treasuries tend to do better.  I.e. the whole ""flight to safety"" thing.  This is what the levered strategies above are all counting on.  They hold long term treasuries so that when the equities fall over, they aren't totally wiped out... That's the theory.  In times like the 70's when we had crazy inflation and rising rates.. well that would have wiped ALL of these levered strategies out faster than you can flush a toilet.
