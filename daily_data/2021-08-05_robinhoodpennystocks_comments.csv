3,ETH, Yeah but with ETH London fork coming and BTC bouncing at the 40k range it should stay fairly steady overall for a bit.  Im bullish on the London fork helping to keep crypto in the green for a while.  As far as I know it’s about 1250+ BTC this year at end of July for Riot.  As long as HUT keeps bringing more miners online they could close the gap on Riot production.  Though I doubt they will ever get to the same production as Riot in BTC.  If they branch out to other projects though they might be able to at least keep up revenue wise.,kresslin,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/oy3nys/penny_stock_unusual_option_activity_with_bonus/h7ren4s/,0.147,0.784,0.07,-0.9081

8,RH, I got you. I should have made it clearer in my post about that too. I feel like my money is safe in Fidelity whereas RH is ran by a Kylo Ren looking scumbag who couldn’t answer a single question during his interrogation.
