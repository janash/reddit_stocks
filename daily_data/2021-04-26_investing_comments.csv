But if you only had 1,000 shares you'd be getting $145,000 in cash and **837.8 shares** of CVS... and so the fractional shares are referring to that amount. It just means that you'll receive 837 shares instead.   


It seems confusing but that language is in every single merger agreement that has a weird fraction like that. Its just to cover their ass legally to specify that fractional shares aren't a thing and you're not entitled to them on that last share if you don't have a whole number based on your position.

5,CVS," So let's say you have CVS worth 100B and Aetna worth 60 billion and all shares of CVS are out available on the secondary market.    


Aetna buys them for 70 billion, the combined value is still 160 billion (assuming nothing else changed and there's no benefit priced in to both being under the same roof for simplicity).  The 10 billion difference here is profit for shareholders.  


So say one share of CVS is at $100 and Aetna at $212/sh is converted at $145 + .8378 shares of CVS.  The CVS stock portion is worth 83.78 and the cash is $145, for total value of $228.78, meaning shareholders get a \~10% premium over the 212/sh.    


By not issuing fractional shares, that just means that if you hold one share of Aetna you don't receive .8378 shares of CVS.  You receive 0 shares, but are compensated in cash for the value of the fractional shares.  


So you would just receive that $228.78 in cash.  


Say you own 100 Shares of Aetna, you receive 837 shares and cash compensation for .8 shares.  Where do those 100 shares come from?  They're issued new from Aetna (the acquiring company).

There's two separate things happening here: 

1) the allegations that the LTC insurance was underfunded - while these appear to be true they were ultimately not significant enough to cause investors major concern.  LTC insurance is generally hard to price to begin with - and correcting the funding issue isn't the sort of thing that was going to cause some major financial detriment.  Overall it was a short thesis built on making a mountain out of a mole hill.  

I also don't think this is indicative of any major failure in risk controls either - LTC insurance is pretty famous for being a gigantic miss by the entire insurance industry.  Everyone rolled out LTC products in the 90s and 00s, only to almost completely cease the sale of those products by the early to mid 2010s.  Literally every provider found out that despite a ton of research in to the expected costs they still vastly underestimated them - and their products were not profitable.  The idea that capital could have been underapplied to the liability here actually seems more likely than not, considering that basically everyone got it wrong with LTC insurance.  

2) the securities fraud lawsuit - in general it would be helpful for you to understand that securities fraud lawsuits are largely bullshit.  Matt Levine is a columnist at Bloomberg that has a running segment called ""everything is securities fraud"" where he just documents a bunch of cases of people filing securities fraud lawsuits for any little thing.  Here is an excerpt from one of his writings on the subject: 

> Everything is securities fraud

>You know the basic idea. A company does something bad, or something bad happens to it. Its stock price goes down, because of the bad thing. Shareholders sue: Doing the bad thing and not immediately telling shareholders about it, the shareholders say, is securities fraud. Even if the company does immediately tell shareholders about the bad thing, which is not particularly common, the shareholders might sue, claiming that the company failed to disclose the conditions and vulnerabilities that allowed the bad thing to happen.

>And so contributing to global warming is securities fraud, and sexual harassment by executives is securities fraud, and customer data breaches are securities fraud, and mistreating killer whales is securities fraud, and whatever else you’ve got. Securities fraud is a universal regulatory regime; anything bad that is done by or happens to a public company is also securities fraud, and it is often easier to punish the bad thing as securities fraud than it is to regulate it directly. 

>This is mostly a theory of U.S. law. It is also not an exactly accurate statement of U.S. law, and sometimes courts actually reject everything-is-securities-fraud theories, but it is a good practical tool for predicting whether a scandal at a U.S. public company will lead to a securities-fraud lawsuit. It always predicts that the answer will be “yes,” and the answer is always “yes.”

In general it's best to assume that the presence of a securities fraud lawsuit is not indicative of anything negative at all - and in this case the judge dismissed the case immediately, which further indicates it had no merit.

Right, it's not that securities fraud doesn't actually exist.  It's just that most securities fraud lawsuits are based on bullshit.  For instance in this case there's two options: 

1) Management knew LTC insurance costs would be significantly higher than they presented, they deliberately lied with the intent to manipulate the stock price or mislead investors. 

2) management was just wrong about calculating the capital necessary for the insurance costs.  This is a mistake, perhaps a material one (in this case it wasn't even a material mistake), but it's not fraud.

I realize Reddit is now populated with a certain demographic that automatically assumes option 1 is the case, but in reality option 2 is far more prevalent than option 1.  And from a practical standpoint it's difficult to just start suing a company every time an exec is slightly wrong about something, but in America we do it anyway.  

Hence a lot of securities fraud lawsuits are basically suing over an option 2 style scenario, and many aren't even trying to hide it.  Abstracting away from the GE case specifically, I think the Seaworld case is a great example:  Yes treating wales like shit is bad, and yes this did lead to bad press for sea world and a drop in the stock.  But does not adequately disclosing the risks of bad press, as a result of treating a whale like shit, in your 10-k equate to securities fraud?

43,HGH," Is anyone else a little worried about the stock market trajectory? Gains since about march last year have been insane. If you look at long term overall market trends this is the most high speed bull market in history. It's on steroids. Probably also creatine. And HGH. Volatility in the crypto market is also mind-boggling. Everyone and their mum now seems to believe they're fantastic investors because they're all riding the stock & crypto rockets. Meanwhile, the bond market is absolute trash.

I don't know what to make of all this. Halfway last year most analysts worth their salt were already saying we're in a bubble, yet so far it only keeps growing more rapidly. Of course it's impossible to predict when the end of the bubble will be or why, it might not be here for a while, but does anyone have a clue of how bad it will be when it bursts?

Is it still even possible to really spread risk in this market? What's to say that an eventual massive stock crash won't also seriously impact the bond & crypto markets simultaneously? Given the volumes of money involved, what's that going to mean for the big retirement funds? 

Lots of questions, I don't have answers. I'm unsure about investments vs cashing out and just waiting for the moment.",Thucydideus,16,/r/investing/comments/mytddo/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gvx0veq/,0.079,0.878,0.043,-0.9065

48,MRVI," **DD: $MRVI is primed for explosive growth**

\--------------------------------------------------------------

Maravai LifeSciences had a successful IPO in November 2020, and the stock has appreciated almost 28% on strong Q1 sales and the strength of their market position and [intellectual property](https://investors.maravai.com/news-releases/news-release-details/maravai-lifesciences-expands-its-intellectual-property-portfolio).

\--------------------------------------------------------------

**Bull case:**

Among $MRVI's subsidiaries is Trilink Biotechnologies, which is the industry leader in manufacturing mRNA endcap molecules, which are used in the manufacture of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, and will be used in many other mRNA-based products in the future. Additionally, the company is now positioned to manufacture and ship mRNA [end-to-end](https://investors.maravai.com/news-releases/news-release-details/maravai-lifesciences-offers-end-end-mrna-production-launch). To support these initiatives and rapid growth, Trilink recently [doubled their manufacturing capacity](https://www.trilinkbiotech.com/press-releases/city-of-san-diego-proclaims-mrna-day-in-celebration-of-new-maravai-lifesciences-headquarters), and have moved to [staffing their facility 24/7](https://www.trilinkbiotech.com/press-releases/maravai-lifesciences-expands-trilink-biotechnologies-cleancap-mrna-capping-capacity-and-adds-new-plasmid-dna-manufacturing) to keep up with demand.

It appears that additional booster shot vaccines will likely be necessary, and perhaps an [annual COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/15/pfizer-ceo-says-third-covid-vaccine-dose-likely-needed-within-12-months.html) will become as widely consumed as other seasonal vaccines. This recurring revenue stream could be highly lucrative for $MRVI.

Now that COVID-19 has proven the efficacy of mRNA-based treatments, I would expect to see this segment grow significantly as [new industrial applications for the technology](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243) are uncovered and rolled out to market. The future is bright.

$MRVI are scheduled to issue their second-ever earnings report May 10th, and the consensus is that they will beat [last quarter's stellar report](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRVI/earnings). After their first earnings report, the stock briefly jumped to $43/share, and good news on a second report could push the stock's price to stabilize in the $40s. Long-term, the stock appears positioned to grow into a similar type of organization as $TMO, which should give you some idea as to the long-term potential for growth.

\--------------------------------------------------------------

**Risks:**

Management: Based on [Glassdoor reviews](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Trilink-Biotechnologies-Reviews-E357835_P2.htm), it appears that Trilink is having some trouble implementing operational processes quickly enough to keep up with their growth. These growing pains are to be expected for a company that has grown 500% in 24 months, but still something to keep an eye on.

Competition: As mRNA products become mainstream, Trilink may face increased competition from established players, including Moderna, AstraZeneca, and BioNTech. Fortunately, due to Trilink's patents and market position, it should be able to hold its own in this sector, but there will be other players jockeying for position.",praythegayawaymods,3,/r/investing/comments/mytddo/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gvyejpo/,0.013,0.924,0.063,0.9302

65,NEO," I have just recently started trading and I have already encountered price dilution via an ""accelerated bookbuild offering"". I actually did not even know that this was possible, so this is a concept that I am just beginning to learn about.

At the moment, ""MindMed"" is a trending stock that is rapidly increasing in value because it will start be traded on NASDAQ tomorrow. It is currently being traded in the OCT, NEO and the Frankfurt exchanges.

My (very novice!) intuition is telling me that MindMed will capitalize on the momentum generated by the uplisting and will issue new shares while the price is up.

I would like to understand the following things:

\- Is it common for a company to dilute their shares following a price spike due to hype?

\- Can a company actually benefit from a short-term hyped price spike, or do they need to set the price well in advance of a share offering?

\- Is there a limit to how much a company can dilute their shares?

\- Is there a way to get more information about whether a company plans to or is allowed to dilute its shares?

do some Future Value math on your retirement chunk and figure out what it is already worth in 38 years, you may surprise yourself.  if that puts you ""on track"" you may not need to be maxing out those retirement vehicles.

Apple - people need ipads/computers to learn from home or buy their kids for remote schooling

Microsoft - cloud and remote work software

Google/FB- with stuff closed down more people online 

BRK - strong company with large cash position that can weather the downturn 

big retail and consumer(WMT, JnJ, COST) again more people eating at home, buying cleaning products staying home more so just needing more home products

In the US the conventional wisdom is CDs and Bonds; but agaisnt inflation, that's kind of just keeping your money worth what it is is now however many years later.
That's kind of the lowest risk option in investing.

You can also do broad ETFs covering the market, index funds, and generally speaking you're making a safe bet as long as you can be flexible for a few years if the economy is bad.
If the economy tanks and your portfolio is worth less, houses are also probably going to be worth less too.

79,IMO," I think there are cycles to time in real estate just like with anything else.  if you invest in an area that has good forward prospects for up trend it's a lot better than trying to catch the bottom in a down trending area.  I think we have a pretty mixed real estate market right now.

Not all real estate is residential real estate outside cities, which is in a state of under supply for demand.  Inner city residential isn't holding up.  Manufacturing square footage is great, malls not so much.  These kind of trends usually take a while to play out with real estate.  I think we also expect interest rates to continue rising over time which will eventually damp down future pricing.  Supply/demand issues aren't necessarily by themselves indicative of a bubble, and IMO, with real estate you should be looking at your cash flow from ownership versus cost to own... so whether or not you have pricing power to positively impact your cash flow going forward is just as important to analyze as how much you pay for it.",LiqCourage,3,/r/investing/comments/mys3nh/timing_of_real_estate_investments_compared_to/gvxwn5v/,0.015,0.837,0.148,0.9764
80,GDP," I'll add my vote to your side about being able to time both. 

However I will add a few things:

* Specifying the definition of ""Timing"". Timing in my book means you're timing the market in a wide range in comparison to a much longer range rather than buying short term absolute peak/bottoms. I don't believe most humans can hit the perfect peaks or valleys without manipulation/quants/algos. However, most humans can dollar cost average over a short term lower range, hold and repeat on dips, and then do the reverse in a higher range. If you're investing in for the long term (1-10yrs) or ultra long (10-40yrs) and buying the economic dips then you're technically ""timing"" the market.

* ""Timing"" the market is much more possible if you're looking at wider market with an index fund using long term macroeconomic indicators, fed guidance, and long term global economic trends. It much harder to ""time"" individual stocks: Do I know how the FAANGs or TWTR will do this week? I dunno I suspect up? Could go either way. But I can bet my home that the indexes will be higher 5/10/20 years from now, GDP growing in the Asia Pacific over the next few decades, or the 10y T-note remaining below 10% for the next 4 years.

* Buying a home =/= Real estate investing. You're not really investing in real estate as an asset if you're buying a home to live in. Real estate investing is buying a property that is generating cashflow. 

* Timing the real estate is also possible but there are multiple factors involved that make it hard or not very profitable for the average person to time the market: the illiquid nature of the asset, high transaction costs to buy/sell (still no RH for homes), larger active management, high capital costs, and long term nature of the asset calss.

It's not recommended that you try to time the market buying your home. Just like how it's not recommended that you try to time your retirement portfolio and better to just keep buying and holding your contributions. Since you are living in it. It's more important that you buy within your comfort range and hold for the long run.

I compared renting (in Ottawa, Canada) to buying a comparable condo:

> Financial author William Bernstein [recommends](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/02/your-money/to-buy-or-rent-a-home-weighing-which-is-better.html) **no more than** 180x monthly rent.

> Ergo, if you’re paying $1000-$1500/month in rent (entirely doable in Ottawa) you should be able to purchase a comparable dwelling for $180,000 to $270,000. Using $1500/mo rent as a baseline: show me a condo in Ottawa that you’d WANT to live in for $270,000 - not happening.

> Now add taxes, condo fees, and insurance on top of that, averaging $850-$1,150/mo. ([examples](https://old.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/mn6gup/did_you_buy_a_house_you_couldnt_really_afford_how/gtxuj6l/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=canada&utm_content=t1_gucsnlj) to back that up) and it doesn’t make fiscal sense to buy a condo, not by a long shot.

I feel more confident index funds will grow at 8% per year than I do homes appreciating at a rate that makes them an attractive investment. The [Case-Shiller index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case%E2%80%93Shiller_index) suggests home prices, over the long term, revert to mean.
