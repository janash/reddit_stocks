0,IRS," They are getting way smarter.  The fine is small enough for a company to not bother fighting it.

The IRS is the same way,  they sent me a $104 penalty fee for underpayment.  In the same letter, it said the penalty was $135  but because I overpaid so the net penalty for underpayment is reduced to $104.

However, calling the IRS means more than 1+hr of wait time with no guaranty that I won't get disconnected.  I tried and had to hang up at around 1hr to do something else.  $104 is less than 0.1% of the tax that I paid so I just roll over and pay the darn fine.",paq12x,101,/r/stocks/comments/nu950n/france_fines_google_267_million_for_abusing/h0was1h/,0.108,0.817,0.075,-0.6934

6,SEE," It is such an exciting time to be in the crypto world! With so much going on with the USD, many are turning to crypto as an alternative to the norm. I, myself, worked the past 10 years for a fortune 500 company but recently parted ways to embark on this journey with crypto (I was able to SEE the financial freedom that everyone talked about)!  
We wanted to be apart of this amazing revolution and we are proud to announce that our team has recently launched a new currency called LeeCoin.  
LeeCoin (black logo with gold lettering) lives in the Stellar Network and recently launched on [StellarTerm.com](https://StellarTerm.com) and [Lobstr.co](https://lobstr.co)! Fast transactions with extremely low fees! Since launch we have seen substantial growth as well as companies like Coinbase and Bittrex who have already invested into LeeCoin!  
You can find out more information on the official twitter page:

Most industries which require large amount of power , don't like paying upfront and save in the future. And with low oil prices adjusted for inflation, the solar industry isn't as shiny as used to be.

Unless your speculating a large move in the oil price.

You won't learn how to ride a bike by going to a seminar or watching a video or asking a friend. You can learn a little bit, but eventually you just gotta do it. That doesn't mean be in a rush to spend, but don't be afraid to give it a shot.

&#x200B;

If you don't know anything and have the worst luck in the world, the worst thing that can happen is you lose 100%, right? So pick an amount you are willing to lose and split it amongst 5 stocks. Invest evenly in those stocks. I'm telling you right now, when you have actual skin in the game, you will follow those stocks like a cheap tattoo on a Walmart shopper. You are so much more 'invested', even with just a couple hundred dollars here and there, than if you paper trade or simply watch stuff. Your learning curve will accelerate tremendously.

You might make money, but you will probably break even or lose 15% when all is said and done. And this is called: the cost of tuition. Cherish it, because the more you learn, the more you will make later on. My ""cost of tuition"" was $40,000 and that was in the year 2000. In the past 6 months I have turned $13k into $55k, and now that my divorce is done my financial future looks very bright.

Okay, so anyway, onto the next subject, which is what to buy. As a former stockbroker I will tell you that there are 4 basic types of investment philosophies, and many times 2 or 3 of these will overlap. The philosophies are: Contrarian, Momentum investor, Value investor, and Fundamental Growth investor. Just about everyone who puts money (in a serious fashion) into the market follows at least one of these philosophies. The first step in knowing what to buy is determining what kind of investor you think you are. Breakdown:

&#x200B;

Contrarian --> When everyone says sell, you buy. When everyone says buy, you sell. Stock skyrocketing means avoid like the plague. Stock falling off a cliff means potential opportunity.

&#x200B;

Momentum --> Find something that's moving and ride the wave. Doesn't matter what the name is, or what they do, or whether they are profitable. If the stock is going up, buy calls or stock and sell it when the ride is over. If the stock is going down, buy puts or short it and cover when it stops dropping. Day traders often fall into this category. Successful ones, anyway.

&#x200B;

Value --> Find something that is worth a lot more than the stock is trading for, buy it, and be patient. This is where doing your DD is extremely important, because people have different definitions of ""value"". I find that cash flow, earnings, undervalued assets, etc are good ""value"" items, but that's just me. If you don't know shit about accounting, then don't trust earnings reports and P/E ratios, because they can be easily manipulated.

&#x200B;

Fundamental Growth --> Find a company that is growing (organically) AND the stock has not yet 'taken off', and buy it before wall street recognizes that potential. This is usually a very long term endeavor, and is horribly frustrating when you are wrong. But when you are right, you can make 5x, 10x, 20x your money over a period of years.

Just wanted to add to the discussion. Certainly agree with the commenter that there is lots of opportunity as a contrarian, but this is a tough kind of investing to do right. Careful being the contrarian.

It requires an immense amount of both patience and confidence. You need to be able to look at a company's prospects and financials, and truly understand that the company will come out okay. Then you gotta be alright with being wrong for a long time before you are ever right.

And be warned, what goes down does not always come up!

The other thing is that I am not sure contrarian investing is a great approach in this current market. There are ALOT of companies that are down and out, but in my opinion, most of them have already priced in a full fledged recovery - to infinity and beyond.",Troflecopter,1,/r/stocks/comments/nu1mdg/stuck_and_dont_know_what_to_do/h0xfhwy/,0.071,0.76,0.168,0.9578
96,PFE," Okay, it’s good you’re looking into simulators.

Your “strategy” is basically the reason you make certain decisions. What you need to answer is the question of “what is your goal for getting started with the markets?”

Are you looking to make multiple trades over the course of days/weeks/months? If so, I won’t provide advice on that.

Are you looking to put in a few dollars every paycheck towards the markets in order to grow your money in the future? If so, great!

I understand you don’t have a big wallet. Don’t let that discourage you — I don’t care if all you can spare (responsibly) is 10 bucks a paycheck, you can still benefit from this!

I also realize you don’t know everything, and you want to find companies to buy. Well, the good news is that there are organizations that actually handle all of that for you! These are called ETFs, and there is an entire world of them for you to explore!

Let’s say you want to just invest in the overall S&P or NASDAQ or whatever. Or, you really feel good about renewable energy. Natural resources. Online retail. Machine learning. Social media. You name it, there are probably multiple ETFs out there, each with their own strategy.

You can find and learn about these at ETF.com.

While I would recommend you explore the filters to get an understanding of the various industries and sectors available to you for invest in, you can also start your search by individual stock. (So let’s just say you got the Pfizer vaccine, and you think the pharma sector might be worth investing in, so you see what ETFs PFE is part of.)

Literally, just start by finding 1 ETF that sparks your interest, and start putting money into it as you can, gradually over time. During that time look for another ETF that looks compelling, and then start buying into that one as you can.

Seriously, if you find 1-4 ETFs to sprinkle your money into over time, I have a feeling you will not regret it 5 years from now.",InitializedVariable,4,/r/stocks/comments/nu1mdg/stuck_and_dont_know_what_to_do/h0vnu7f/,0.012,0.857,0.131,0.9897

101,ST," You should aim for the lowest tax liability possible - if you have multiple lots of something, trim the lots you've held for >1yr and pay LT gains as opposed to ST.

The trend is your friend - avoid selling anything that's performing really well, especially if it's netted a lot of gains.  Do the profit taking when it stalls out. Conversely, anything heading down, might be time to dump.

The worst thing to do is cash your biggest winners because you'll have the most capital gains to pay next year, and if it's ST gains especially, you'll need to sell quite a bit more stuff just to make the tax bill, compared to mixing in a lot of losses to keep your tax bill as close to 0 as possible.

165,CRSR," My two cents: Logitech has a market outside of just gaming. I haven't done a lot of research on turtle beach, but in CRSR's case the ""hype"" around it is tied seemingly directly into PC building (right after IPO there was additional interest that came from the new GPU launches, uncertainty surrounding covid, the holiday season, and the new consoles). Well, have you *been* to subs like r/buildapc or r/buildapcsales lately? It's depressing. Many people aren't as excited about PC gaming at the moment because everything is so insanely expensive due to the mining craze.

CRSR has been doing well with their pre-builts, but as much as people hate to admit it, numbers alone aren't everything. You need some form of market hype or unexpected catalyst. E3 might cause some interest by next week, but really what you want is PC building to become attractive again.

My perspective: I went heavily in on CRSR at 15.12 and sold when it suddenly shot up to 50 in November (my original price target was $30 *after a year*). I kept one nostalgia share and have followed it regularly since listing. For what it's worth, I do think right now is probably a decent time to enter.",Crossopholis,2,/r/stocks/comments/nu88z0/rstocks_daily_discussion_monday_jun_07_2021/h0xcc9v/,0.08,0.765,0.155,0.9485

206,IBKR," That's always a nice surprise to see your limit order filled at a significantly better price at market open. Well, for sales at least, it's bitter sweet when a bid gets filled cheap because a stock you're averaging down on dumped, lol.

I've noticed IBKR let's you manually toggle 'outside regular trading hours' for GTC limit orders. I've been wondering when that's wise to keep a limit order active during all hours. You'd think it would be wise to do for stocks with less liquidity during pre/post-market trading, as there's been many times I see a stock trading at +/- 4.7% pre-market, beyond my order price while it isn't on the books, then it's back to the previous day's range after market open & my order remains unfilled. But those same lower liquidity stocks tend to be lower market cap & more likely to see large intraday moves, thus increasing the odds of a favorable fill for orders that are only open during regular hours.

Maybe it's mostly a wash in the long run, but what I'll probably do is include extended hours for stocks that are less volatile & tend to bounce around in a broad price range (like a dividend payer with a mostly horizontal price chart), so my orders can benefit from those extended hours deviations. Conversely, I won't include extended hours for more speculative stocks that are likely to see large sustained price movements (an example being RIDE, I had an order fill substantially above my ask price at market open when it surged last week). It would be mildly annoying to see a stock go from $10 one day to $14 the next, & see that your $10.50 order got filled during the move up in pre-market trading.

230,OR," Even if the price surges like crazy buyers will still need to clear your ask at $11 to move beyond that. That's if the surge happens during the trading day, your GTC limit order will be on the order book at $11 waiting to be hit. 

A common exception is when the big move happens outside normal trading hours, because most GTC orders are replaced by your brokerage every day at market open, & removed at close. I've had it happen many times where say the stock price closes at $10.60 on Friday then that evening there's a good earnings report, Monday morning the stock is trading at $12, you check your order status & see ""$11 limit sell filled @ $11.83 9:31am."" Limit orders are indeed orders to fill at X price OR BETTER, so all the lower asks got filled first that morning followed by yours, all at the newly elevated price.

Some brokerages allow you to keep your GTC orders active into extended hours. An advantage of this is that your limit order may be filled by random fluctuations because the order books are much thinner after hours. So the stock price may close at $10.60 Tuesday, your $11 sell fills at 7:48am EST Wednesday, then you see the stock trading around $10.50 after market open Wednesday. A disadvantage is you are less likely to benefit from the price surges I mentioned in the previous paragraph.",existenceawareness,1,/r/stocks/comments/nu88z0/rstocks_daily_discussion_monday_jun_07_2021/h0wh1o5/,0.031,0.885,0.084,0.9063

249,IT," Not sure if you're being woefully ignorant or just replying in bad faith. Every single insurer covers Humira or similar TNF inhibitors, meaning that list price of $60k a year isn't representative of what patients are actually going to be paying. And to remind you, insurers only cover Humira and other TNF alphas because it has clearly demonstrated clinical efficacy in a number of different diseases (RA, PA, etc.). 

The problem with aducanumab is that most insurers probably won't be covering it because WE DON'T KNOW IF IT EVEN WORKS. Look at what happened with Eteplisen from Sarepta back in 2016. Anthem (the largest insurer in America) and a number of other insurers REFUSED to cover the drug because, like aducanumab, it didn't show clear clinical efficacy, only improvements in a biomarker (in that case dystrophin concentration). So what this meant is that patients desperate with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (which typically kills the patient by the age of 30) had to pay out of pocket cost (which is ~$300k a year) and financially ruined hundreds of families for a drug that WE STILL DON'T KNOW WORKS TODAY, but has serious side effects (like aducanumab). Do you understand the difference in scenarios between Humira and Eteplirsen/aducanumab?

So what does this mean for your average patient and family? It means that a decent number of them will be paying out of pocket for this drug that may not even work. That's where the sticker price is actually going to come in. It's clearly a political move from the FDA to approve this drug, afterall the FDA's own Advisory Committee voted unanimously to not recommend approval of aducanumab in November. It was a political move by the FDA and Biogen from advocacy groups and investors who wanted a return on their investment (nothing wrong with that if the drug actually works). Again, I'm not against pharmaceutical companies or investors making a return on investment and I admire that Biogen, among a few others, has remained committed to searching for a cure for a number of debilitating neurodegen. disorders, but we have to have a moral backbone and say it's not good for patients or families to potentially bankrupt themselves just to see if a drug may work. And to your point about desperate advocacy groups, I recognize the desperate nature of Alzheimer's, same with countless other neurodegenerative disorders, but that doesn't mean we should lower our scientific standards for drug approvals and push the burden of proof on patients, families, and other Americans for a drug that, again I sound like a broken record, MIGHT NOT EVEN WORK.",b3astown,3,/r/stocks/comments/nuf3aq/biogen_biib_drug_aduhelm_aducanumab_approved_by/h0y9dk2/,0.125,0.819,0.056,-0.9833

268,ATOS," For ATOS (from Yahoo, credits to RuLaiFu)

This is becoming a game of mind and time by now, however, I’m a Believer/Man of Faith!

All our DD since 12/2020 can not be all wrong;

ATOS managed to have 3 direct offering within 3/4 months, which is unheard of;

ATOS halted a critical P2 of Endoxifen for Breast Cancer about a year earlier, which is also very exceptional;

ATOS asked for extra 325 Mil AS (vs existing 123 Mil) which showed how good they felt about P2 Data of Endoxifen, and this was also kind confirmed by the way Dr. Quay talked about ""having a nice P2 package to talk to big Pharm ..."" in the Presentation at the Investor Summit Conference on 05/18/2021;

All the smart money behind 06/21 and 07/16 calls and the 10 HFs (each invested $5 Mil for off PPS at $2.88 in late 03/2021) are controlled by some very smart and greedy pro in investment, I would not believe that they could be fooled by anyone!

On 05/19, all 6 ATOS employees exercised all their available options at $2.90, Dr Quay - 1.90 Mil SH, Kyle - 0.85 Mil SH, others - 50,000 SH;

269,DD," For ATOS (from Yahoo, credits to RuLaiFu)

This is becoming a game of mind and time by now, however, I’m a Believer/Man of Faith!

All our DD since 12/2020 can not be all wrong;

ATOS managed to have 3 direct offering within 3/4 months, which is unheard of;

ATOS halted a critical P2 of Endoxifen for Breast Cancer about a year earlier, which is also very exceptional;

ATOS asked for extra 325 Mil AS (vs existing 123 Mil) which showed how good they felt about P2 Data of Endoxifen, and this was also kind confirmed by the way Dr. Quay talked about ""having a nice P2 package to talk to big Pharm ..."" in the Presentation at the Investor Summit Conference on 05/18/2021;

All the smart money behind 06/21 and 07/16 calls and the 10 HFs (each invested $5 Mil for off PPS at $2.88 in late 03/2021) are controlled by some very smart and greedy pro in investment, I would not believe that they could be fooled by anyone!

On 05/19, all 6 ATOS employees exercised all their available options at $2.90, Dr Quay - 1.90 Mil SH, Kyle - 0.85 Mil SH, others - 50,000 SH;

274,AAPL," You're getting a lot of answers from people who were never in your shoes and only see rent as net cash flow, net of work, net of worries and net of risk. That isn't accurate. You have to maintain your property, you have to carry a liability insurance in case your tenant sues you. You pay property taxes... Like someone in the comments mentioned, it is work. You may also face a tenant who stops paying and won't leave. Not only do you no longer collect rent, you also have to pay attorney fees to evict. Don't expect to retrieve your property in good shape when the sheriff kicks the tenant out. Been there, no fun.

Also, the argument that you shouldn't sell to avoid paying taxes seems like a weak one too. You won't pay taxes on the same gain twice if you switch to stocks, and you're not going to escape taxes by holding on to those properties. Your goal is to build wealth to improve your lifestyle or build a retirement fund. So you will have to sell eventually because you can't pay your kids' college tuition or buy yourself a boat when you're 50 with a townhouse in Seattle. Besides, if you need to sell your property, you have to do some repair to make your property look good, contact your realtor, list the unit, wait for a buyer, go through inspections, etc... It may take months until you actually receive the funds. On the other hand, you can buy stocks today, sell tomorrow, withdraw the funds the next day. The idea is liquidity.

Now the argument of value. Let's see where you'd be if instead of buying that property, you would've invested the same amount of money in Apple for instance, and not even look at your investment until now. In January 2015, AAPL was $26. It was $44 in January 2018. Today before open, it's $126, i.e. +484% from 2015 and +286% from 2018. You can use a Vanguard ETF like VGT if you prefer: +353% since January 2015, +225% since January 2018. Compare this with your +35% and your rent, deduct your mortgage, insurance, repair, realtor fees, property taxes, taxes on your rent, the time you spent dealing with issues...

That being said, stocks are a completely different animal. For starters, it's more volatile. Company performance dictates stock price in the long run, but short term price is very unpredictable. So if you think you'll need the money in less than 6-12 months, don't invest in stocks. But if you won't need the money soon, pick a few solid Vanguard ETFs for instance, you can literally buy today, and not look until 2035. You can also generate some income stream for yourself with covered calls. If you pick your stocks well, you'll see that some can be used for that purpose only and generate more money than rent.",wasinwill,3,/r/stocks/comments/nu3um6/sell_my_real_estate_and_put_profits_into_the/h0wj3tm/,0.042,0.9,0.057,0.8611
275,ID," I had two rental properties. I sold one in July 2020 and the other in April 2021 so yeah pretty recent. I'm paying pretty hefty taxes on the sales too but it was worth it to me. That is one thing I dislike about real estate, you can't sell just a bit of it to optimize taxes like you can with stocks. I had a property manager and every time I would see their number on the caller ID my heart would skip a beat. It was always bad news. They never once called to say the tenant wants to pay double this month. My properties were on the low end so I had pretty bad tenants. It might be a different story with higher end properties. 

I have to admit the real estate has been a good investment though. One house I bought in 2012 for $53k and it sold for $290k this year and it was rented all those years for about $900/mo. Houses were so crazy cheap around here after the great financial crisis it was a no-brainer to buy.

353,BBBY," ""I want to start making investments based on whether if it's going to change people's lives and I want to know what companies that you believe are doing this.""

BBBY Bed Bath and Beyond because they do 9 billion revenue, and are turning the ship to be profitable. Market cap is only 3 billion with 100 million share float. 98.4% institutionally owned and 2.7% insider owned (increased by .8% in the past 6 months). It is also >30% short interest right now, with the interest rate on the shorts slowly increasing by the day.

Mark Tritton (new CEO) is the special sauce imo. His Nike and Target experience will shine here.

This is a company that everyone recognizes. The short interest thought it was a dead store and would succumb to the fate of toys r us, sears, hertz etc. , but that assumption is far from the truth now.

Due to the short's greed and being nasty vultures, they have over extended and now with the high short interest, this company is rising from the dead. They cut the fat during the pandemic (brands and stores that were failing) and remodeled stores while traffic was down, while recently announcing vertically integrated brands that will hopefully increase margin.....

Pent up demand for kids going back to college. People having parties at home now rather than restaurants (BBBY has a focus on kitchen as part of the ""beyond""). New home market and the new things needed for the home. Post-Covid Summer baby boom for their Buy Buy Baby brand. All aligning nicely.

Mark is also focusing on the omni channel sales aspect and integrating the personalized data for customer experience online and in store. Whether they accomplish this is to be seen, but they are starting to have meaningful data, and Mark's track record as Chief Merchandising Officer at Target and listening to him present shows me that he knows where he needs to focus in order to become the apex Karen destination for their home necessities.

The juice is worth the squeeze on this one!
