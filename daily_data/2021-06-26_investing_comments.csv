8,CBD," This right here. I have a long term opioid prescription. Been on percocet and indomethacin since 2018. Was heavily counseled by my doc on the risk for dependency/abuse. I have an undiagnosed idiopathic pain problem that suddenly manifested in 2018 out of nowhere. 10 different doctors and specialists have no answer. I was suicidal because after 2 years I just couldn't go on with the pain. I would have pulled the trigger had I not had a doc who was interested in pain management for me.

I'm not an addict. I will purposefully go week+ long stints taking no meds and choosing to suffer just so I can give my liver and kidney a break. I come under my prescribed amount so often I go months without needing refills etc. That's how my doc knows I'm doing good and not abusing things.

I have tried legal cannabis and every chronic pain med out there to no avail. Found I'm allergic to cannabis. CBD does nothing and I already have a bunch of allergies to analgesics like morphine and codeine etc. Take away oxycodone and you'd basically be putting a nail in my coffin because living every day feeling like your joints are ripping apart and your muscles spasm so bad you can't walk is no kind of life for anyone.",m_mensrea,22,/r/investing/comments/o8c72n/johnson_johnson_agrees_to_stop_selling_opioids/h34bcgm/,0.174,0.759,0.067,-0.9786
9,VERY, I think that’s the case now. I’m unfortunately one of those that’s had my fair share of surgeries and my experience has been that within the past 3-4 years pain pills are rationed VERY carefully (deservedly so). The last surgery I had I was given only the amount required to make it to my post op follow up a week later and not a single pill more. The days of “here’s a 90 day supply with a couple of refills” are gone. My daughter had surgery three months ago and she was given a total of 3 days worth with instructions to call in if still in extreme pain.,asimplerandom,15,/r/investing/comments/o8c72n/johnson_johnson_agrees_to_stop_selling_opioids/h34sthc/,0.081,0.838,0.08,-0.2672
10,JNJ," That doesn’t make any sense though. If there were ever a snowball, it would be the opioid crisis. JNJ stopping production isn’t going to all of a sudden halt opioid production in the US.

There are countless corps out there that are solely dedicated to the production of opioids, and they’re not going to just up and quit.",landocalzonian,3,/r/investing/comments/o8c72n/johnson_johnson_agrees_to_stop_selling_opioids/h34ft1n/,0.078,0.88,0.041,-0.4019

14,JNJ," JNJ stopping production of opioids means more market share for other companies, meaning they’re more likely to profit and less likely to stop production themselves.

16,JNJ," So how is JNJ stopping production, in any way, worse press than the millions of lives that have been lost, and the years that we’ve spent being aware of it? 

It’s like saying “Ford is stopping production of vehicles, so every other manufacturer has decided to stop producing vehicles”. It has nothing to do with the accidents or car-related deaths. But all of a sudden because one company decided to step back, all of them are? It only increases demand, which only helps other companies. The gov’t isn’t going to *all of a sudden* give a shit about the opioid crisis now that one corporation decided to stop producing them.

Also do you know what Qutenza is? The low dose opioid is incredibly important for the patient adherence of Qutenza, and opioid at LOW dosages almost never lead to hyperalgesia.

18,CBT," I also have ADHD and take amphetamine salts like you probably do. This isn’t the case for my state as I can get a month supply. I also can call my doctor after the 30 to request her to send another prescription to my pharmacy. 

Personally, I wouldn’t mind calling her every 10 days if that were to change. I remember going through College, before being diagnosed as an adult, and the amount of people taking it that didn’t have the condition was and is insane. It is a problem like it or not. People are fucking irresponsible man and unfortunately sometimes we have to bare some of the consequences too. 

Personally, I cannot wait to get off my meds as I was successful without them through school and only started REALLY having issues when I transitioned into the professional world working from home having a sick computer and a shitload of cool stuff to do other than work lmao.

I wanted to join the National Guard and then found out after being prescribed that I have to now wait 2 years or prove to them I’m not dependent on the drug to serve (in my case it might work out since I only started taking it as an adult). I was really bummed out that something I am passionate about wouldn’t be possible because of said medication. I believe there’s reason to it too.

I absolute HATE the side effects and it helps to hunker down and get shit done, but that’s it. Heart rate goes up, I get more anxious, my hands get cold I really don’t like it. So I’m exercising again same as I did through high school, doing CBT therapy (highly recommend a professional that knows CBT) and following my passions rather than just doing a job.

I’m very hyperactive, trust me, and I can write walls of text all day on Reddit and write to my Senators on weekdays for fun lol. But idk man for me I don’t think long term Adderal and it’s generics are the solution but rather a combination of different things.

I took the personal choice to quit it once I am able to because I refuse to give up on a long life dream of serving my country in some shape or form because of a medication. 

I truly wish you and others well. Just always remember things aren’t black and white and hopefully there’s some other way to tackle your current problems.

Just remember there’s people out there that made it their lives mission to help people. Make sure you try some CBT therapy if you ever get the chance.",InTheMoneyAlex,1,/r/investing/comments/o8c72n/johnson_johnson_agrees_to_stop_selling_opioids/h35440n/,0.055,0.801,0.144,0.9917

25,JP," I prefer ""exciting"". The stock market has been a great (greatest?) wealth creator and this bull market helped me get Bernake's ""wealth effect"". Thank you Bernake.  

I can get excited for a few reasons: 

The wild +/- 5%  market moves during the pandemic in March were super exciting. As a retail investor, market mayham is exciting. 

Massive up or down moves In stock  causing  holdings to go up or down significantly is very exciting because I can pile on as the market usually overeacts to the downside and the  rebound is usually pretty significant in itself. If they are up quite a bit,I  just watch and savor the temporary high.


I'm not a dividend fanatic but there is something to be said when you see big chunks of cash  every payout and then notice the capital appreciation that came along with it. I bought fairly large positions in high dividend paying stocks last year when they reached multi-year lows providing some once-in-a-lifetime  yields...stocks like JP Morgan Chase (~4%), Exxon Mobil (~8%), Phillip 66 (~7%), Walgreens (~5.5%), Gilead Sciences (~5.5%), Reality Income (~7%) I get large chunks of cash  from these every month/quarter and their share price is up anywhere from 25% to 80%. 

I get excited when I see the once upon a  time boring dud hated stocks in my portfolio that I've held for the longest time now kill it - Target, Abbvie, Disney, Kroger, Apple (yes, Apple was hated for around six to seven months from September 2012 to April 2013 when it sunk and stayed sunk by around 45%...so hated that Bethany McLean of Enron expose fame predicted it would crash to some 70% from it's highs because of....wait for it, Samsung) 

One new development this year that  I'm excited about is the Donor Advised Fund I started sometime ago and a brokerage account just meant for the DAF. The buys from last year + the rebound has put us in a position to donate enough gains to the DAF and reduce our overall tax bill quite a bit and let the principal ride.

Then I'd take that 50k and put it in a mix between ecommerce stocks, big tech (GOOG, MSFT), PLTR, and BTC/ETH.  Start with 25k then add 1k every 2 weeks til you hit 50k. This is way less risky than going into a real estate blind or crypto mining as an amateur.

36,AAPL," 1/2: book values are reported in the financial statements, they are recorded at historical price/cost. Market values are based on prices in the current market and reflect many different factors including interest rates, cap structure, market sentiment, etc. For example, the market capitalization of AAPL is their market value of equity, the book value is what's on their financial statements.

This applies to debt because the market value of debt reflects other factors as well, such as the note's time to maturity, coupon, and interest rates.

3: market value of debt can be calculated using a formula, adjusting for the current cost of debt. (Links [1](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/valquestions/mktvalofdebt.htm), [2](https://www.myaccountingcourse.com/accounting-dictionary/market-value-of-debt), [3](https://www.cfajournal.org/market-value-of-debt/))

Book value of debt typically includes things like notes payable, short term debt, current portion of long term debt, and long term debt. What you include specifically varies a bit based on the company.

4. effective tax rate is taxes paid / EBT. Companies are taxed at a statutory rate, but due to many nuances and adjustments (such as deferred tax assets/liabilities), the actual tax number is almost always different.

The reason why your intrinsic value of the company may go up when you increase the tax rate by a certain amount is that higher tax rates result in lower post-tax cost of debt (all else equal), which lowers your discount rate (assuming you are discounting by WACC). The offset here may be greater than the decrease in taxes paid, especially considering that you are discounting the terminal value using this number as well.",bz142857,2,/r/investing/comments/o8asul/quick_help_learning_dcf_model_analysis_and/h33zvx4/,0.078,0.772,0.151,0.9464

102,ICE," Tesla wins because they innovate. 

It's why the Model Y for them is more profitable made in California than Ford's MachE is when made in Mexico. Or that they go the same distance but the Y battery pack is ~20% smaller. And that's a huge deal. With gas cars you just make the tank bigger. With batteries the fewer you use per car the more cars you can make. If Ford can make 100k MachE with a certain cell supply Tesla would be able to sell 120k Y's.

Same thing with Cybertruck vs Lightning. Or S vs Taycan. It's not just the performance, but the tech they develop to pull out that win. 0-200mph with 1 gear because of a world beating novel use of carbon fiber. Folded stainless steel body with no paint shop.

Or that Berlin and Austin are going to be using fully cast front and rear ends. Lower cap-ex, smaller manufacturing footprint. Better product. Faster production.

4680 cell with DBE. Austin and Berlin will, over the course of the next 4 years likely surpass the expected output of the dozen factories VW plan on building by 2030.

I'm touching very lightly on the subjects that Tesla bulls understand well. When in 2013 Tesla said 500k by 2020 people thought they were crazy. And they did it in spite of a pandemic. 20M units per year by 2030 is no joke. I like to say 2032 because of Elon time.

I didn't even mention Full Self Driving. Yes, it will come. And no, it won't be MobileEye or Waymo.

I didn't mention stationary storage. It, right now, is where Tesla Auto was in 2017, just picking up pace. Tesla Auto can 40x over the next 10-12 years. Tesla storage can 300x over that same time.

And finally, a myth thrown around is the size of the EV market. There is a vehicle market. Period. The Y doesn't just compete with the MachE. But also the CR-V, RAV4, and more.

TSLA will be a multi trillion market cap company before the end of the decade. With a PE in double digits.

And for everyone else to even get fully vested they have to divest themselves from ICE. And that will be like chewing your leg off to get out of a bear trap.",IAmInTheBasement,1,/r/investing/comments/o8dur6/whats_your_current_portfolio_total_and_allocation/h34nj01/,0.063,0.836,0.102,0.9341

115,CE," I specialized in valuing private company stock for a many years. It's the same method, usually a DCF or market multiples (from transactions or public comps) but there are some differences.  With private companies first of all there are many different reasons to value private companies like financial reporting (goodwill impairment tests, share based compesnation aka warrants), litigation (shareholder disputes, divorces, fraudulent conveyence, bankruptcy), tax issues (gift and estate tax) and many others. Often bigger chunks of private companies are valued and therefore unlike tiny slivers of public companies, you may end up valuing controlling stakes.  Plus, the other huge thing is Lack of Marketability. There are no markets for private companies usually.  I'm not talking about preIPO stock, but just regular private companies.  Therefore, once you arrive at your indicated fair market value, you often lop off like 40% of value to account for this discount for lack of marketability.  B/c fair market value is a notional value.  You might have a value but what if no one is there to buy the stock when you wanna sell it?  These shares have no markets for them usually.  So that and also Lack of Control are very big issues and have huge impact on value. I don't think they really account for this stuff on SharkTank.

129,BK," I am  bullish for what I feel to be good reason. Three things that attracted me are:
1) A company with a light restructured debt load.
2) A company with a highly recognized brand
3) A company reentering the market place in a hot market for its product.

That being said it is a confusing settlement. I think it was a difficult negotiation with stakeholders that were made mostly whole. Part of the compromise was the right to purchase shares at an equity offering prior to the start of the new Hertz. The success of this offering will determine the number of warrants and the strike price of each warrant. All indications are that the right offering was over subscribed. Meaning that the warrant should have a lower strike price. 

Anyway, the BK document put the value somewhere between $7-8.  Most believe that this was super conservative. And that was not factoring the popularity that Hertz has found.
