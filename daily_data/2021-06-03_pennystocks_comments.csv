MassRoots Issues Update on Its Expected Acquisition of Empire Services, Inc. and Plans to Uplist to a National Exchange  
7:17 AM ET, 06/01/2021 - Business Wire  
MassRoots, Inc. recently entered into a Letter of Intent to acquire Empire Services, Inc., which is expected to result in MassRoots generating significant revenues and positive cashflows from operations  
  
NORFOLK, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jun. 1, 2021-- MassRoots, Inc. (‚ÄúMassRoots‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) (OTCPink:MSRT) is pleased release the following update on its expected acquisition of Empire Services, Inc. (‚ÄúEmpire‚Äù) and plans to meet the listing requirements and apply to list its shares of common stock on a national exchange.  
  
MassRoots recently entered into a Letter of Intent to acquire Empire, which is expected to result in MassRoots generating significant revenues and positive cashflows from operations. Upon closing of the Empire acquisition, the Company intends to apply to uplist to the Nasdaq Capital Market or the NYSE American Market, which MassRoots believes would result in a significant increase in visibility, liquidity, and institutional interest for its stock.  
  
‚ÄúWe believe it is in the best interests of our more than 30,000 shareholders to put MassRoots on the quickest possible path to a listing on a national exchange,‚Äù stated MassRoots Chief Executive Officer Isaac Dietrich. ‚ÄúAt its core, MassRoots is a technology company and when we took a look at Empire, we saw an incredible opportunity to apply our knowledge and expertise to an often overlooked yet highly profitable industry. We believe the Empire acquisition will put MassRoots on a stable financial footing, with positive cashflows from operations, and will likely enable MassRoots to meet all the listing requirements of both the Nasdaq Capital Market and the NYSE American Market.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúOver the coming weeks, we intend to expand MassRoots‚Äô board of directors through the appointment of seasoned and diverse professionals to ensure we have independent directors who not only meet the requirements of a national exchange but also give confidence to institutions that we are establishing strong corporate governance,‚Äù stated Danny Meeks, the sole shareholder of Empire. ‚ÄúUpon closing of this transaction, we believe MassRoots will have one of the most compelling stories in the small cap market and we could not be more excited to get to work for all of MassRoots‚Äô loyal and supportive shareholders.‚Äù  
  
Upon closing of the merger, Mr. Meeks will join MassRoots‚Äô Board of Directors as its Executive Chairman. Established in 2002, Empire operates 10 metal recycling facilities in Virginia and North Carolina and expects to continue expanding its footprint in the coming quarters. It has historically generated higher profit margins when market prices for metal rise.",KinCO_Toreador,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/nrmcv0/msrt_been_running_lately/h0hduj5/,0.008,0.823,0.169,0.9979
164,DD," I've been seriously contemplating this one after reading several well educated DD posts from a few trusted sources I follow. I'm going to grab a starter position with it's current setup. I don't think it will dip much more to be honest, but worth a starter to watch for a week to see how it goes. If it dips, I'll be grabbing more most likely. Close eye on this one!

168,RM, Would agree.  If one plays custodians this is a near guaranteed hit in the custodian world.  Sharp has done it with TSNP which blew up; now Humbl.  GVSI has now a market cap of:  55 MILLION with OS of 2.4 BILLION.  GOFF is done (custodian granted).  GOFF has only 227 MILLION OS and market cap of 15 million!  I would think this is a near certain/ eventual 3x (just to get to GVSI level).  It is a MUCH better share structure so if a company wants to go public via Sharp who wouldn't choose a share structure of 227 MILLION vs. 2.4 BILLION?  This means a good chance of a much better quality company on eventual RM.,10xwannabe,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/nrjask/why_i_believe_goff_has_huge_potential_upside_in/h0hnml0/,0.0,0.834,0.166,0.9508

The last investor presentation they did they said they have 3 more clinics finalized and ready to move towards operation.  I don't recall exactly the numbers but I sort of remember something about each clinic becoming profitable after 1.5M or so of revenue.  I could be completely wrong on this, I am going from memory so take it as any other free reddit information.

Larry Diamond was the founder of MinuteClinic, another similar company that was purchased by CVS.  Hopefully he can do it a second time.
