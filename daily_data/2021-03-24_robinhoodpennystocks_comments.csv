96,AEZS," Greetings RHPS folks, I started doing some tracking at the start of February to see how well various DD posted under the ""DD/Research"" flair panned out. These are the results of these tickers from first DD posting until now. For those posted on February 1st, there's 34 trading days, and obviously fewer for those posted since then. I'm continuing tracking for at least a year to see how some of these ultimately play out long-term.

&#x200B;

Columns are: Date of DD posting to this sub, Trailing 7 and 30 days (to see if there was already a ""pop"" ahead of the DD post), the highest $ close after DD posting, how many days after the DD that appeared, % gain/loss since DD

&#x200B;

Comments/Analysis: 

\* February 10th is a bright divider

\* Every DD before February 10th (54 in total) have all had positive gains, with only three even in single digits

\* The 33 DD's after February 10th have not had much short-term success, with the exception of ENTX, which I have hardly heard people talk about here since initial posting (+277% since 2/12 posting). Given the general bearishness and corrections in penny land the past month+, we'll have to see how these 33 play out long-term. (On a subjective note, as a whole, the DD seemed to be noticably worse quality for the second half of February)

&#x200B;

Biggest Gainers (so far...):

LKCO - 317% gain 5 days from 2021-02-08 posting; has never closed lower than initial DD

ENTX - 277% gain 19 days from 2021-02-12 posting

AEZS - 209% gain 2 days from 2021-02-04 posting

ARTL - 187% gain 11 days from 2021-02-01 posting; has never closed lower than initial DD

REI - 170% gain 28 days from 2021-02-02 posting; has never closed lower than initial DD

SNDL - 161% gain 3 days from 2021-02-05 posting

ZOM - 145% gain 2 days from 2021-02-01 posting; has only barely closed lower than initial DD once, 1 day later

GSAT - 109% gain 6 days from 2021-02-08 posting; has never closed lower than initial DD

DNN - 104% gain 9 days from 2021-02-03 posting; has never closed lower than initial DD

CHEK - 93% gain 28 days from 2021-02-02 posting

&#x200B;

\* NOTE! Be sure to also interpret that a max gain happening X days later means it's been lower ever since. For the \~2-3 day ones, their pumps have dumped. Conversely: REI, CHEK, ARTL have had more continued growth than burst.

100,DNN," Greetings RHPS folks, I started doing some tracking at the start of February to see how well various DD posted under the ""DD/Research"" flair panned out. These are the results of these tickers from first DD posting until now. For those posted on February 1st, there's 34 trading days, and obviously fewer for those posted since then. I'm continuing tracking for at least a year to see how some of these ultimately play out long-term.

&#x200B;

Columns are: Date of DD posting to this sub, Trailing 7 and 30 days (to see if there was already a ""pop"" ahead of the DD post), the highest $ close after DD posting, how many days after the DD that appeared, % gain/loss since DD

&#x200B;

Comments/Analysis: 

\* February 10th is a bright divider

\* Every DD before February 10th (54 in total) have all had positive gains, with only three even in single digits

\* The 33 DD's after February 10th have not had much short-term success, with the exception of ENTX, which I have hardly heard people talk about here since initial posting (+277% since 2/12 posting). Given the general bearishness and corrections in penny land the past month+, we'll have to see how these 33 play out long-term. (On a subjective note, as a whole, the DD seemed to be noticably worse quality for the second half of February)

107,DD," Interesting data, and thanks for putting this together. I have three points. First, I think you should add % change from first DD day to current price. That would really illuminate which ones may have been part of a short lived p&d. Second, I wouldn’t necessarily say that the DD in the second half has been worse. The market has been worse for OTC stocks. From about December to mid-Feb you couldn’t lose. My portfolio rose about $75k just in OTC lol. Lastly, I’m not sure it’s fair to judge a ticker from the first dd in that month. For example, I remember reading about ZOM back in December. Wouldn’t it be better to find the first ever DD post and track from there? Otherwise, you will run into issues of people holding bags posting DDs.",recklessSPY,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/mbwc51/dd_tracking_results_february_2021/gs0fkhu/,0.089,0.833,0.078,-0.1341

109,DD," Good call on #1 - easy enough to add for future months.

\#2 I thought I addressed with this comment ("" Given the general bearishness and corrections in penny land the past month+, we'll have to see how these 33 play out long-term. ""), as I wasn't really faulting the DD themselves. That said, I do track my own subjective opinions on the DD and the poster, which I didn't share in these charts. I make those decisions daily as I'm loading the tracker, and those were tangibly worse in aggregate in late February. But, full agreement it was can't-miss for a while and there were absolutely bad DD's in early February that still had success from the overall rising tide.

Completely fair point on #3, but given the manual loading and review of each DD that I have been doing, going back in time was more time than I can allot. Hopefully as the tracking continues, this will self correct as time passes.

180,CTXR," CTXR or TRIT (little over a penny)

Both are arguably long plays. CTXR Pt is $4-6 by May roughly. Some would say possibly more but take longer. TRITs Pt seems around $14-20 but may take the bulk of the year to do it. (CNN money even says $18 by end of 2021) 

Im at 350 shares avg. 1.85 with CTXR, 
110 shares avg. 7.28 with TRIT

183,CNSP,"  These are our top 3 stock picks for 2021!

Maybe look into them;

1) PKT (Industrial Real Eatate)
2) FIRE.ca (TSE) Supreme Cannabis
3) CNSP Pharmaceuticals (which has multiple price targets of $10-$12, but if the release a phase 2 drug approved by FDA, this stock can go to $90!",FitRecognition5037,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/mc9jgf/gme_crash_happening_now_prediction_gme_closes/gs2mdzx/,0.0,0.846,0.154,0.7896
