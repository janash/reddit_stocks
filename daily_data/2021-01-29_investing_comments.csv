0,GME," If y’all haven’t seen it the Andrew Ross Sorkin interview with Vlad is fucking hilarious.

The basics are that Vlad is claiming DTC collateral spiked pretty aggressively, and they made the choice to stop carrying these tickers because of that.  Basically in so many words he said the collateral requirements were too high and to protect RH they made the decision to block trades.  He literally says “protect the firm”, which is well and fine - but it means that the firm was at risk if they continued to offer these shares which has some implications.

Vlad: (blank face) No, there was no liquidity problem

-	RH has liquidity concerns, and stopped trading because of that. This checks out with the news of them seeking an immediate 1B infusion from investors, and them drawing credit lines down yesterday. 
-	RH doesn’t have a liquidity issue, and just decided it didn’t want to meet capital requirements on those stocks because fuck you
-	RH doesn’t have a liquidity problem and chose to stop trading due to pressure from some external source. 

Vlad says it wasn’t the first or last, but that only leaves the middle which doesn’t make sense.  I know there’s a lot of conspiracy theories floating about but in my mind the easiest explanation is that RH has a liquidity problem, I mean we know they can’t get as much for PFOF as they were, and we know they can’t get much revenue from NIM, it’s not hard for me to believe they’re short on cash.",MasterCookSwag,561,/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/gl88dzj/,0.131,0.782,0.087,-0.965

3,GME," Why couldn't this go on for another 2 months? I know the short answer is that hedge funds pay out the ass in interest on short positions, but from some very basic math, it seems like the interest on the total 30B dollars worth of shorted GME stock, at %30, works out to \~200m per week to not close out short positions.

Why wouldn't they hold out few weeks/months, hoping that retail investors lose stamina/interest, or get cold feet and sell before then? It seems like the hundreds of millions in interest would be a reasonable last ditch effort, over closing out with multiple billions in losses.

The premise that there is infinite upside to this for retail traders assumes the shorts have infinite funds to keep paying their premiums. The shorts are going to run out of money eventually right? 

The shorts know they are finished and as farewell F U to shareholders announce bankruptcy, the short (debt) positions evaporate and the premise for an elevated share price is no more. So yeah, victory achieved, the baddies lose, but so does retail if they didn't sell in time.

How can retail possibly continue to push the price up once GME is trading at $300 per share? What if the millions paid in short interest accumulated per day is just a tiny drop in the bucket for these massive hedge funds?

48,GME," Ok, this is not trading advice, and I'm not a financial advisor, etc.  This is a good teachable moment.  Do this quickly before end of day and see what happens.

Ok, if you're on Ortex looking at the short interest chart for GME, do a few things.

First: make sure you understand the definitions of every term on the chart (click the little '?' above the upper right corner of the chart if any are unfamiliar).

Next, go to 1 month timeframe.

* Turn off 'days to cover'.  If you saw the definition you'll understand why it's meaningless in a stock with high volume volatility.
* Make sure the following are on: price, volume, utilization, on loan

Now.  do The following calculations:

1/28 volume / 1/26 volume = ??
1/28 on loan / 1/26 on loan = ??

Which is shrinking faster?  on loan or volume?

Basically a squeeze is a race: will long-side vacuum up volume faster than short-side can cover all shares on loan?

Because what happens if you have shares on loan and effectively no volume available??

Once the price becomes unsustainable for their account margins, shorts are forced to buy all their shares back from whatever volume is available.  Where is volume headed?  Extend that to today (look at today's volume chart.. say  if you can).  Where is volume headed by the end of the day?  If you divide a pretty big number by the number volume is approaching, what do you get?

Also, look at the utilization.  What do you see there?  What is the definition of utilization?  at a high level, one way you can kind of think of it is how aggressively are shorts loaded up to be able to sling share volume that day.

The thing to watch now is price action into the close.

53,RH," My take:

I think Wall Street is trying to protect the $GME crew and prevent them from losing everything. They can't communicate with retail, but they don't want them hurt.

My points:

Retail $GME Traders do not have the power/shares/demand they think they do.

Jim Cramer, CNBC, and publications are not lying when they are saying shorts are covered and they should take profits and leave before they lose their gains.

RH Restricting Buys, Limiting Purchases, Everything Else can either be anti-consumer, or trying to get them out of their position.

The change in volume and laddering downwards to trigger selling is definitely trying to get people to sell and leave their positions.

>Melvin may have been squeezed out of their position back when GME was in the $100 range or possibly lower, partially using emergency cash injections from Citadel and Point72. Melvin would then be on the hook to pay these loans back with interest (using their other assets as collateral). WSB seems to think Melvin still has its shorts, referencing the high short % float (still >120% by [some](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME&ty=c&ta=0&p=d) [estimates](http://isthesqueezesquoze.com/)), but this could easily be new shorts not owned by Melvin. For example, my favored hypothesis is that many individual investors bought puts, forcing option contract market makers to delta hedge by buying shorts. In this scenario, I don't really see a short squeeze playing out quite as aggressively, if at all really. Market makers know how to hedge and they already know how volatile this market is. Overall, I think Melvin will probably get out of this with 30% losses or so from the event - big but not life ending. My prior is that internal regulations probably regulate when they must stop out of a bad position. There's also weak evidence in the form of CNBC rumors that they've closed their position and also the 30% number that keeps getting thrown around.

142,SPH," Does SPH produce propane and sell it at wholesale or are they just a distributor?

edit: from what I read they are a marketer and distributor, not a producer. The rise in propane prices can be attributed to a reduction in crude oil refining, of which propane is a byproduct.

so unless they hedge the price on 100% of their propane distribution volumes (totally possible, I’m not sure) they’ll see an uplift in realizations (and sales volumes, depending on where they distribute)

373,DD, I got ya for some reason TSMC didn't click with my brain lol but yea I don't know too much about the lithography companies but with GloFlo going bankrupt it seems like it's just gonna be TSMC and samsung in the race. every year the amount of competitors shrinks due to the massive costs associated with upgrading your lithography(billions). But I really don't know who's going to win that battle afaik TSMC is currently in the lead. I feel a overlooked factor is the fact that chip production is a national security interest in some countries and will eventually become one in most sensible countries so Samsung's fabs could be supported by their government but that's a low chance just something to consider. But yea I would buy TSMC I don't know what is trading at but it's a good company but I haven't done much DD into them they hardware is just good and with only two providers and samsung yield being bad TSMC looks like they may be able to print money if samsung keeps faltering cause Intel's out of the game until 2023 according to them,Y_u_lookin_at_me,1,/r/investing/comments/l7jppw/what_stocks_are_you_looking_to_grab_at_a_possible/glap6cd/,0.079,0.763,0.158,0.9517

This is currently a huge barrier to adoption - there are virtually no second hand EVs so they're out of the price range of most normal people. So yeah, EV fleet = very good for adoption.

Relegating COVID to the effects of a mild flu or bad cold, which the shot appears to do, for the bulk of the US population is a potentially very, very good step towards going back to normal. 

One does also have to assume, given the variants and lesser efficacy of JNJs data in those regions, that vaccine updates and ""booster"" doses are forthcoming.

478,U," I assumed the 60% effective is for infection/symptoms since they also mentioned 80% for severe/death when I heard the report on NPR radio during my morning drive and followed up on with morning coffee:

* Overall, the vaccine was 66% effective at preventing moderate to severe disease 28 days after vaccination. But efficacy differed depending on geography. The shot was 72% effective among clinical trial volunteers in the U.S, but 66% among those in Latin America, and just 57% among those in South Africa. Though markedly below the levels seen with the first two authorized Covid-19 vaccines, those rates are above the thresholds originally set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a vaccine to be considered useful.

* The vaccine reduced severe disease alone by 85%, and prevented Covid-related hospitalization or death, Johnson & Johnson said.

488,GME," Hello,

I’m a young new investor. I’ve been doing my research on investing for quite a while now and really wanted to get involved after learning so much about it for so long.

So about 3 weeks ago I finally opened a Schwab account and put in $5k, which is not a small amount for me, but also not something that would cripple me financially for years if I lost it.

I mostly put it in high dividend ETFs, Vanguard ETFs, some ARK funds, and then a few ETFs in the healthcare and technology sectors. Most of them you’ve heard of before: QQQ, SCHD, VUG, VTI etc...

Over the past week, the markets have not been kind to me and I’m in the red but I know that the goal of these funds is to hold them long term and not react in the short term. I know that over time most of these funds are safe and will grow and show good returns over the next 5 years, 10 years, etc...

I am also aware of the old adage about time in the market not timing the market.

Still though, I am somewhat concerned that this past week is the start of a correction of some kind. I don’t know how large or small of a pullback we might be headed for, or even if we’re headed for one at all. Maybe this weird week has been a result of the GME situation (which thankfully I am not involved in lmao).

I guess my question is, given how little time I’ve actually been invested in these stocks, and with the looming possibility of a correction in the near future (next 3-6 months), I’m wondering if there are any potential strategies to protect my investment in some capacity. I’m not necessarily asking if it’s advisable that I pull all my money out, but are there things to do in this situation for someone like me? Ideally I would like not to go down significantly from the onset and see my 5k turn to 3.5k and then have to spend a year or two waiting just to get back to baseline.

**DISCLAIMER:** I understand that none of you are financial advisors and and that anything you all tell me is not financial advice, just your own opinions. Anything I hear in the comments I intend to consider the pros and cons of myself and decide if it works for me.

506,USA," Off-topic backstory: Hey redditors. I've had this account for a decent minute but I know nothing about Reddit whatsoever, so hopefully  I'm following the rules (I did go through them) and posting in the correct location. Feel free to let me know what to do differently if necessary. I've been seeing Reddit bouncing off the news recently due to the recent market shenanigans so I figured, ""Hey, there's people there that know a thing or two, so why not ask them some free questions?""

What do I want? Let me just run off the template:

1. I'm a 24 year old married man living in Missouri, USA

2. I'm employed as a local/regional bulk semi truck driver. My wife is a shift leader at Walgreens. We collectively gross about $75,000/year.

3. First and foremost, I want to buy a house. I'm sick of living under other people's rules. I have no idea what steps I need to take to make that happen, as school and family did not help my wife and I when growing up. Scrounging up a down payment is proving to be an issue, and I need a crash course in learning about mortgages.

I also want to be able to afford a few toys. I need nicer furniture. I want a pool table. I love project cars as well, but can't start on that dream unless I have a house.

Seeing as I'm still young, retirement is rarely a thought in my mind. I really should start my 401k rolling, but I worry about the money I'm putting into it will be needed for something else.

4. My lease on my apartment expires in 12 months. I'm not sure if I'm in a spot where I can figure out a mortgage by that time, or if I should downsize my living space, rent again, and use the extra money to further save. I absolutely would rather the first option.

5. I don't have a whole lot of money to play with, and losing it would be a big problem. I need something safe for now, but won't mind taking some risks down the road.

6. My current savings account sits at $2300. I can spare maybe another few hundred within the next couple weeks, and y'know, tax returns are coming up soon.

7. I have a few debts. I owe about $3200 and an obnoxious interest rate as I continue to pay back the school I used to obtain my CDL.

I owe more than $6000 to two semesters of community college I took several years ago. The payment is abysmally low which is probably working against me, but I gotta get rid of the CDL payment first because of the interest rate.

My wife still owes another $2000 or so in medical bills.

I pay somewhere around $460/mo on my wife's car payment. I own my car, but it's having transmission trouble, so it might be a ticking bomb.

8. I'm not sure what other financial information will be helpful. I pay $1250/mo in rent. Ask away for anything else.

How have I invested so far? In the past year or so, I've been dabbling around with RobinHood. I'm not making any meaningful investments, but rather just trying to figure out how the market works. I watched my free stock (Eros International) for a few months as it fluctuated by no more than $1. Back in 2020, I added $50 from my bank account to expand to some other cheap stock and occasional fractional crypto. With the recent Dogecoin surge (where I put in $13 while it was maybe around .028), my investment peaked around $93. I put in another $100 this morning but wasn't sure exactly what I wanted to do with it.

563,TD,"  **Background:**

Male, 25. Soon to be married. Fiancé (F,25) is in the armed forces. She has zero investments yet as she is still in schooling. We will start a maxed out Roth once she is stationed. She plans to do 20 years in the service and retire with a military pension. I own a home already. Currently have about 55K equity in it. We will be moving in the next 6 months. we plan on having kids in the next 5 years (2-3 kids total). Both cars are paid off but we will likely be upgrading/ changing vehicles when we move due to needing 4WD. No student loan debt or Credit cards.

**Pay grades:**

Myself, 85K

Fiancé, start as Air Force E-3 ($1,733) a month. Plus BHA (Basic housing allowance) of around $1400 /month.

**Current Portfolio:**

\- 40K in 401K. Contributing $310 with employer match per pay period. 26 pay period schedule.

\- 7K in Roth. Contributing $230 per pay period. I control this account in my TD Ameritrade account.

\- 3K in TD A account of personnel stock investments. Contributing $500 per pay period.

\- Future $230 pay period to Fiancé Roth account.

Planning to increase 401K at a rate of $2,000 a year until maxed.

Planning to increase personnel stock account at a rate of $500 a year until 45.

Emergency fund is currently funded at 5K. Putting $1,000 a year at it.

**Question:**

We want to be completely Financially independent at 45. Knowing that my/our Roth's' and my 401K are not freely accessed until 59 1/2 or older, are we on track to have the cash reserves in our personnel stock investment account to bridge the 45 to 60 time frame? This math is not taking her military pension into account because i do not want to base our investing off of it. if she decides after 10 years that she wants a civilian job, i don't want that to disrupt our future plans. h

We will likely have some income at 45 to 60 but we want to be able to do what we want when we want where we want.",justhereforthehate,1,/r/investing/comments/l7ov2p/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gl99e9j/,0.057,0.888,0.054,-0.4782

However, since the trading day isn’t over, the index funds haven’t settled at the final 10% loss. My question is: when do I deposit the money to buy the funds at the “10% discount”? Is it before the end of the trading day (before 4 PM EST) or after the trading day do I initiate the deposit?

Quick question for you guys. Aon and Willis Towers Watson are set to merge in the first half of 2021. According to the terms of the deal, ""Upon the closing of the combination, Willis Towers Watson shareholders will receive 1.08 Aon shares in exchange for each Willis Towers Watson share they held immediately prior to the closing. The combination is expected to close in the first half of 2021, pending customary regulatory and other closing conditions.""

My (unsolicited) two cents. if ""what's going on"" = GME, I wouldn't really start there. It seems like the proverbial bubble bursts today and, even if not, a couple hundred won't get you much play given pricing on its options etc. If your ok with not looking for a ""quick"" play, I'd recommend an ETF. You can watch it thru the day like a stock (as opposed to how mutual funds work) and you'll likely find one that uses companies you know and will know how to easily monitor. For example, I just bought some shares in JETS (airlines, which Im hoping see a bounce I'm a year or so, hopefully less).  If you're liquid cash is limited, maybe take a flyer on something small. I started my brokerage with buying MJNA (among other things) and it's actually treated me pretty well (but wouldn't recommend putting too many eggs into a penny stock).

It's a casino. Don't go to the table with cash you can't lose, don't play games you don't know, and go to the reputable ones (eTrade, Fidelity, etc).

If you want to invest on your own then go with Schwab or Fidelity that do not charge for trades.

Now what to invest in.  Be forward thinking but practical.  I made a big mistake  with Tesla.  I wanted to buy it at 400.00 and got talked out of it.  The stock was considered by many as way over priced.  Well now that is twice that guess what I am thinking now.  Grinding my teeth that I didn't pull the trigger.  I like stocks that pay a decent amount of dividend.  I am also retired and want income.  You on the other hand should not limit yourself to what an old guy like me would do.  There are a lot of high flying sock I missed out on by being too conservative.  Don't bother with these pay us  'X' amount of dollars and we will send you a fact sheet or we will share our trades with you.  Everyone I subscribed to has been a waste of time and money.

I watch CNBC like a hawk and pay attention to trends and etc.  I have never been brave enough to do options.  To me that is fire-walking.  Depending on your risk level and interest you can do well buying and selling.  When you look at a stock look at its HIGH/LOW for the year.  When it was high what was going on, when it is low what is going on.  Is the company selling or making something that has an end of life in sight or is it selling something we will need for he future.

Check his bookshelf section for reading recommendations and the ""model portfolio"" for allocations. 

A few fundamentals for good investing:
1. Pay off debt first, especially any high-interest debt like credit cards
2. Find a ""risk tolerance"" calculator online and see where you fit
3. Allocate your money according to your risk tolerance.

In the last few years, ETFs have developed into one-stop shops for asset allocation. You probably want to start with a considerable amount of your purchase going towards VBAL or VGRO. VBAL is a little more conservative than VGRO, but they are both on the slightly aggressive/risk taker side of things. These etf's will be fairly stable, so don't expect to double your money (or lose it all) overnight. If you want to set aside some play money after that, go for it, but those are probably the best place to start.

Since I have retired I have learned a really rude lesson.  I worked all my life I saved and saved in the 401K.  Now I retire and every time I withdraw any money it is considered fully taxable income.  Ok that is not great BUT what I have found is when you add it to what you get from Social Security and if you have a retirement  income add that to your income you get bit in the rear with Your Part B and D Medicare.  They charge a monthly amount and it is based on a scale based on your tax form from the previous year.  As you earn more you PAY more and more for the Part B and D.  If your income fluctuates you will face owing money to Social Security.  I did some home renovations and I had to pull money to buy a car.  So in 2019 I filed my income tax and in December of 2020 I get a letter from Social security that says I earned more than estimated and I owe them 4800.00 for part B and nearly 1000.00 for part D.  Plus the monthly cost goes up a bunch.  So it will take me the next 4 or so months to pay them back and they basically keep my Social security check.

So what to learn from that exercise?  When given the opportunity you can convert IRS money to a Roth conversion while you are working.  Yes it increasing your income and you pay income tax on it but the money you put in a ROTH when you pull it out is not considered taxable income.  I don't have that so I am not sure if Social Security would find out about that and hit you up from more Part B and D but it sure would help with taxes in the long run.

This allows RH to utilize customer assets for their own purposes, such as proprietary funding via rehypothecation.  As customers change their portfolio from X Y Z securities to GME stock, I wouldn't be surprised if this results in a RH liquidity run.  This would be due to changes in haircut of GME stock vs other securities in regards to collateral for short term financing.  I haven't looked into this much and I could be wrong.

659,A," I agree with you. A lot of people have started to point fingers at political conspiracy theories, but in reality I don’t think citadel made Robinhood halt trading. Robinhood has done this before on other securities that had huge volatility, so it’s not new. There’s also many stocks that Robinhood doesn’t allow you to buy because they’re “not supported”. Not be political, but this whole drama sounds like when Trump supporters thought the election was rigged. (And I’m a Trump supporter saying this). What ended up happening? They were wrong. All these people are acting out of their ass with the accusations and conspiracies. They don’t personally know Ken Griffin or the owners of Robinhood. Everything is just a guess.

699,A," I think that banking, at the core, is not a great industry for investors.

Equity always returns higher than bonds - banks are always on the ""bond"" side of trades with businesses they loan to, getting only a capped upside but unlimited downside if the debtor defaults.

Meanwhile, the bank is highly leveraged by design of its business model. A good equity/assets ratio (where assets = the loans) for a bank is 10-15%, which means if 10-15% of debtors default, all the equity is wiped out.

Banks are among the most cyclical companies in the entire economy for this reason. The risks they're exposed to are also sometimes hard to predict, as banks try to juice their return by adding more complex debt products, relaxed underwriting, etc etc.

The tradeoff of big banks being bailed out is also that they are heavily regulated and always will be.

If you want a steady dividend, I'd say picking up some small to regional banks is fine. It's easy to be drawn into bank stocks because ""wow the value"" but that conceals a very complex industry with risks unlike most others.

700,A," I have to disagree. Banks can use the cash they have to make a lot of trades that are risk free. Look at the futures market for Bitcoin. BTC market price is $34,800, but Jun 2021 CME futures is 36150. A bank with excess cash can short the June futures and buy BTC in the spot market to make $1350 essentially risk free. 

I am sure there are other markets out there where you can also arbitrage and make money almost risk free as long as you have the funds to do so.",Yurion13,2,/r/investing/comments/l7spg0/on_banks_from_one_of_the_most_respected_research/gladqkn/,0.083,0.781,0.135,0.81

705,BX," I think a lot of people don't want to deal with owning MLPs - BX converted to C corp a while back and the share price ramped because they opened themselves up to new shareholders who couldn't (or didn't want to) own MLPs. Look at how Brookfield Infrastructure Corp (BIPC) has traded in the last 6 mo vs Brookfield Infrastructure (BIP); the C corp has traded at a premium to the MLP. Same with Brookfield Renewable Corp (BEPC) vs the MLP version (BEP).

ET may bounce, but I again I don't want to own MLPs and even if I did, I'd rather own MLP names where I feel like there's good corporate governance (EPD, MMP.)
