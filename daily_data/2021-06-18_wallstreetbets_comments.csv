91,DASH," ‚ÄúPremium is way cheap compared to the day before the crash‚Äù is definitely false. 100% false. It just can‚Äôt be true, by definition. It may cost less, but it doesn‚Äôt mean it is cheap. You will get burned one day with the assumption you are making. And, since you are suggesting buying as much as you can afford, you will get burned badly. 

The problem is if an option traded at, for example, $3.50 before a volatility event, and traded at $2.00 the next day, all you know by looking at those numbers is that it would cost you $350 to buy that option the day before and $200 the next day. Whether either of those is cheap is something to investigate by looking at other numbers. It could very well be that that particular call was very expensive to begin with and is now even more so because of that volatility event. Paying less per option after a volatility event does not mean you are getting the better end of the deal. Visit r/thetagang and see how those guys prey on this very thing and make bank (relatively speaking).

For example in your fist deal you mentioned, where C dropped from $51 to $42, it was trading sideways for over a month after finding the bottom. All it would take for you to loose money is some low delta calls that you bought the second or third day (as you say in your thesis) after the volatility event.

Consider this real life example. I placed some limit orders trying to buy some DASH puts when I thought it climbed unreasonably high and was bound to come down (or so I thought). When I checked later in the day, those puts were selling about $200 higher while the underlying was also up about $3. Crazy right? Well, the delta on those calls was under $30, which means that if I bought those calls at market, DASH would have to drop additional (almost) $7 for me to get in the money. More in play, obviously, but do you follow what I am saying? 

Good luck with your endeavours and I wish you to get rich! However, it looks like you need to look more into how options work and how they are priced.",Fishnguy,26,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o2dzai/secret_to_make_money_on_options/h26qc5y/,0.046,0.863,0.09,0.9584

238,CLNE," The gamma squeeze thesis is when calls become ITM, the MM and the naked call writers need to obtain the shares to cover the call.

With CLNE, there's a TON of contracts written starting at the $10 strike (but a huge chunk at $13).  The ""squeeze"" belief is that when those strike prices are hit, it'll require them to cover and buy millions of shares.

There are a lot of additional contracts above $13 with a lot of interest.  So this triggers a ladder squeeze where the $13 contracts force to cover, which drive up the price, which then may push into the next strike which forces the $14 to cover, etc.

Now, if the day ends in the $13 range, then only the $13s and below need to cover.  The higher the strike contracts will no longer be part of the equation.

Some of the covering will occur throughout the day if a strike price is hit and maintained, and those shares purchased could help momentum forward.  Other covers have a couple days to settle and those buys will not impact today's action (but may impact price next week, depending on how many naked calls were sold).

Again, all of this is a thesis so nothing is guaranteed.

Do you think we have patents that big oil need or is there another angle to make money? Please no memes or emojis just well thought out words that answer the question would be appreciated.,namloop,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o2bwu9/clne_ceo_speaks_and_tweets_clne_ready_for_launch/h27dkzk/,0.082,0.802,0.116,0.3182
250,BP," To my knowledge I believe Clean Energy Services (CLNE) holds a variety of patents (13) that oilfield companies may find attractive and potentially lucrative. If not directly then perhaps indirectly if they were to extrapolate and engineer based on applying similar ideas to their individual use cases.

For example there are methods of transfer of liquid nitrogen that CLNE uses that are proprietary and BP is similar but the application is different. BP and other well site owners use hydraulic fracturing (fracking) which required coiled tubing operators to pump liquid nitrogen down what are sometimes nearing a mile or miles long worth of tubing in to the ground. That process has been refined but can continue to be made safer or tweaked as time goes on. Perhaps a patent which CLNE holds may lead them in a direction which enables a more refined product for their own use case.

That is one example of potential patent holdings which may be attractive to any oil field operator services but it is by no means a deep dive with comprehensive analysis or 1 for 1 trade offs which benefit both parties.",herpderpa,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o2bwu9/clne_ceo_speaks_and_tweets_clne_ready_for_launch/h27gg8y/,0.014,0.846,0.14,0.9724

324,IT," I dunno. ""Operational Excellence"" comes with figures and makes a proper case, ""Strong IT Infrastructure"" sounds like company PR without sources. The lone quote in the section (""best-in-class client experience"")  is unattributed.

The ""Valuation"" section refers to ""6 companies"" (EDIT: tickers in images I see now). Are they subject to the same interest rate risks? Are their business models comparable? How do UWMC's risks stack up against forward interest rates, or the Fed's dot plot? If the Fed says they're going to be raising in 2023, how many people will be refinancing then?

329,UWMC," Interest rate hikes mean no more refis. You go from 30% refi business to 5% refi business and all you're left with is first and second mortgages. Rising interest rates also mean (a) people can afford less, and (b) people who financed at rock bottom would have to move down in house cost to maintain their current monthly payment, which depresses demand in the move-up market. 

It's a lowering effect on the future total business across the industry. Which is why there's short interest. If you have the backing it's cheaper to short than to buy puts and there's no expiry.

827,AMC," Ok so have a bit of AMC shares.  As I'm sure everyone is more or less in the same boat but my current dilemma - do I also throw in my 15k in savings into the stock as well?  Also, do I sell my other stocks and buy more AMC.  I mean obviously no one can tell the future but ill strategize to maybe sell a few if the prices drops to like 45 and I start getting uncomfortable. 

But for all you medium risk folk - go all in? Maybe sell 25% once/if it hits $75? Another 25% at $100?

Also, why apes? Is it some sort of lower intellectual thing, similar to how everyone says they are retards?

1105,UWMC," That's... not at all how this works.

Since it's very close to $10, MMs very likely already have *all* the shares they need to cover those contracts.  Now if UWMC jumped up a dollar to $11... Then it would be likely that they'd need to buy up shares to cover any naked $11 contracts.  And that might be enough to push higher to $12.  And so forth.

In other words, we would need a few million dollars pumped in very quickly to push it up high enough to start a gamma squeeze on contracts that they never planned on having to cover, plus enough of a bid order placed to cement the price floor at that higher point to force them to not even be able to short their way out of it.  They're market makers.  They don't just decide to not cover their asses on something that has a decent chance of going against them.  They cover on the way up, and they're likely covered before they start to lose money.  If they made basic mistakes like this frequently, they definitely wouldn't be in the game for long.

1. Situation can only improve from here. Govts are stepping in to to try to boost chip production and research to remedy the situation long term.
2. Inflation isn't a major concern because automakers don't really have an alternative that is as good and secure as QNX.

1373,HUGE," The difference is the charge time.  A 400 amp single phaze panel can havdle 800 amps of breakers.  The slower the charge the less strain on the batteries and the longer they  will last.  This is why Solar is the best way to charge batteries.   These vehicles are on the road usually around 6 hours a day.  They would easily charge with a 15amp service and it would be better for the batteries.  A 60 amp 220 volt charger (like Tesla) gets 37 miles per hour of charge.   it would take a 15 amp 110v charger 8 hours to produce the same amount of charge.   Ave postal vehicle traveles 21 miles per day and is parked 16 to 18 hours a day.  They would be parked and charging mostly after hours when the office is closed.  It is all in the engineering.   Time on the road and available charging time make a HUGE difference.  There are several ways to do it.  Solar carports with power walls, would be the neatest way to go, much more upfront cost, but they cold run the post office by day and charge the vehicles at night.",Unclebob9999,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o2md0h/stick_with_amc_but_if_you_do_diversify_into/h290vac/,0.0,0.941,0.059,0.7999

1402,AMD," AMD also at $97 last December. Plus intel is going to hybrid x86 architecture by the end of the year with alder lake. Being that AMD ""7nm"" is close to the same physical size as Intel ""14nm"" I would imagine intel finally going to 10mn is going to soak up a lot of AMD's recent momentum in the mainstream and enthusiast CPU market. On top of that TSMC (who supplies all of AMD's silicon) has a lot of automotive and electronic equipment silicon demand to catch up with by buyers that have deeper pockets than the enthusiast market where AMD is gaining ground. Most of the hype around AMD's recent performance advancements are centered around ""fanboyism"" for the brand and wanting to see an underdog topple intel and nvidia. I see an upside to AMD taking over market share over competitors in the server/datacenter arena if they can fix their DOA product rates and burnout rates vs. the competition but they're still competing against companies with bigger R&D budgets and bigger market share.

If your argument on core count were correct, we would still be running 4 cores and 8 threads, paying $500 for a high frequency chip. Today, you can run 16 cores in your consumer desktop, or up to 32 in Threadipper.

AMD released SmartAccess Memory (SAM) with better implementation than Nvidia and also have SmartsShift for the laptop space. They have recently launched the Asus G15 Advantage edition at $1650... with the best mobile CPU and a 6800M (using both SAM+Smartshift).

They have 44 studios backing AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution. We are talking 44 studios!!!... NOT 3 games they have to bribe a developer to justify some stupid RTX rip-off TAX.

AMD FX Super Resolution is **FREE**... available to everyone. Even RX 400's GPUs from 2016!!!... How is NVIDIA more consumer friendly???

AMD is **NOT** launching a 3080ti at $1199... which is frankly, **RIDICULOUS**.

Just look at the flak Linus is getting for attempting to sugarcoat supporting a stupidly priced product.

What ""consumer"" pays an extra $500 for +8% performance over a 3080??

Seriously, when you write ""Switching"" what are you switching from/to ???

You'd rather a 3080ti @ $1199 (12gb) vs. 6800 (16gb) at less than HALF the price ?!!?

FOR WHAT???... So you pay $1500 for a 4080 next year???... And then see AMD's MCM RDNA3 leave that crap in the dust???

The 6900XT is setting WORLD records all over the place. Just go an check.

1425,AMD," I agree, mostly considering the 50% revenue growth AMD is expecting this year, a 35.5 P/E is cheap. In essence, if you can make that 50% go to the bottom line (if not more), the multiple will drop next year.

However, Nvidia has a few items that don't make me as confident on an >88 P/E.

\#1- The ARM deal is priced in but will likely get rejected (top dogs don't want it).

\#2- The upcoming launches from AMD (mostly the APUs) will hurt Nvidia.

\#3- AMD has MCM coming (RDNA3) with the potential to leave Nvidia in the dust.

\#4- As intel joins the GPU world... Nvidia will be the only player without CPU's (provided #1 doesn't occur).

So for those reasons, a P/E of >88 seems unjustified.

On the flip-side, AMD is reasonable at 45 to 55 P/E.",MrObviouslyRight,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o28q7u/amd_heading_to_mars_eta_soon_next_stop_galaxy/h25ffsz/,0.09,0.871,0.038,-0.8217

If you want to keep your DDR4 RAM, you can consider AM4, which is already the most successful chip-set in modern history.

If you're happy spending money on DDR5, sure... go for AM5. Zen4 is going to smoke everything out there. Once again, AMD is only competing against itself in the enthusiast CPU market. I can't wait for Threadripper Zen3... which is likely delayed due to the shortage (it's all going to EPYC right now).

The spies are doing their job well and the hedges managed to keep the price below $13 today. If the stock was above $13; they would have to cover their losses. See the max pain estimate in this website: [http://maximum-pain.com/options/CLOV](http://maximum-pain.com/options/CLOV)

The good news for the ones holding shares (my calls became worthless today) is that the shorts kept increasing their borrowing and taking more days to cover. So don't listen to the chicken shit talk and hold, our day will come sooner than later and with a BANG.

This is something worth considering when comparing the business model of Qatar Airways for example to AA.

1768,AC," The new hvac units are extremely efficient. Heating is now 50% more efficient and the range will not be near as affected by AC as it would heat. 

If you're cruising around like a normal person, AC won't fuck up your day or range. If you want to cherry-pick a ""day long-road-trip circuit through Death Valley with the cabin set at 64 degrees"" you might succeed at skewing the results to the intended effect. 

But then again, I drive about 150km per day and charge my car at home while I sleep, like I do my cellphone. Four years of Tesla ownership (older models with far less range than the plaid) and range has never been a concern.  If it was, I might consider the very convenient lifestyle of an ICE: visit a secondary location once a week to have the privilege of paying 10x more to fuel my car.",ValueInvestingIsDead,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o2vk2e/tesla_model_s_plaid_receives_348mile_epa_rated/h28k7pl/,0.025,0.86,0.115,0.8949

> Investment in pharmaceutical product development is highly speculative

They're bleeding cash. Have more debt than assets which I guess makes sense for a pharmaceutical company starting up. They tell you right in the filing they're dependent on the success of ORGOVYX. So this is a very high risk, potential reward situation. Not even sure if it's high reward. 

This is a wait and see for me. If they can make money off this drug and they're able to make other drugs then maybe. Pharmaceutical companies are high risk Jo matter what. Their success always depends on the next drug being a success.

For a company operating at a loss, lots of positive things can happen but the products need to earn and offset operating costs. Just going to assume if you have half a million in shares and this much knowledge you are an insider anyway ? (Trying to dump?)
