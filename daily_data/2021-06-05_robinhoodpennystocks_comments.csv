0,SNDL," Some of those things you've claimed to be positive are in fact absolutely disastrous. If those are considered positives, God help SNDL.  


They've got that cash because they (repeatedly) dilute their existing shareholders to hell. That's not cash earned through operations. It's not something to be proud of.  


4.7% institutional ownership shows that SNDL is propped up by retail traders who don't know how to accurately value a company. Their $1.8 billion market cap wont see many institutions buying in anytime soon.  


SNDL generated $9m revenue in Q1. Nine million. And their market cap is $1.8 billion. There's companies out there, like EXPFF, who generated $4m in Q1 and only trade at a $26m market cap. If companies wanted to buy market share, SNDL are one of the last companies they would buy. They have so little! EXPFF is only just behind them and they cost over 50 times less to acquire.

1,SNDL," SNDL is a dick tease. The cannabis sector overall is a dick tease. Back in Feb the sector rose to new heights and then crashed. I think the public gets momentarily excited when rumors of federal legalization are rampant and then grow flaccid when it doesn‚Äôt happen immediately. I think the sector will continue to do this until there‚Äôs actually a passing vote. Just my gut feeling.

5,SNDL," Excellent post..I'm a big fan of SNDL been in with 5k shares since January @0.60..was very pissed when stock tanked and I didn't cash out but have been really impressed with what they have done with the funds they raised, great aquisitions. They are positioned to cash in when the US legalizes and also with canada reopening.

6,SNDL," SNDL trades as a proxy for US legalization. Early this week was bullish (rumors that Chuck would drop his bill ""any day""), last few days bearish (rumors that the parliamentarian's crackdown on reconciliation foiled Chuck's plans). It will continue to trade as a proxy.

There is no reasonable case that SNDL is actually worth its current valuation.",Semioteric,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/nt0wy5/bullish_argument_for_sundial_growers_sndl/h0q0j7z/,0.074,0.893,0.033,-0.34

I do have SNDL too though.  Weed is weed and retail is turning this into a casino. Weed gets legalized nationally in the USA in the next few years and retail should buy like crazy regardless.

10,SNDL, If you‚Äôre bullish on cannabis it would make more sense to purchase shares of a company that is actually based in the US. Plenty of more sensible companies that are here that will benefit a lot more if cannabis is ever legalized. SNDL doesn‚Äôt even have a single us operation and have no intention of entering our market.,CMISF350,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/nt0wy5/bullish_argument_for_sundial_growers_sndl/h0q3sub/,0.037,0.875,0.088,0.4588
11,SNDL," It's worth checking out for sure. It was trading at 5 cents ($6m market cap) a few months ago. It was an absolute steal.
