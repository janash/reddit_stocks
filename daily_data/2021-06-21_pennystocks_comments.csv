3,CTXR," Yes, Mino Lock. Is making us money now. BUT wait for Halo-Lido... that's an actual untapped gold mine.

I'm very long on this stock. Expect nothing but good things.

\*EDIT\* 

TLDR

CITUS wants to save all the butts and help breast cancer patients. 

Figured I'd add a quick explanation, on why I'm Long for Halo-Lido and the future of this company.

In case you are new to CTXR, Mino Lock is currently our bread and butter BUT looking to the future Citus. HALO-LIDO, MINO-WRAP.

Halo-Lido

There are no FDA-approved prescription products on the market for hemorrhoids.  
Citius’ could become, (still pharma be careful), the first FDA-approved product to treat hemorrhoids in the United States.

  
According to IMS, over 25 million units of topical combination prescription products for hemorrhoids were sold in the United States during the twelve-month period ending June 2012, comprising an estimated $80 million annual market.

EVEN further in the future: MINO WRAP currently in pre-clinical development.

Much along the same thought of Mino Lock. Product is aiming to reduce and prevent infection.

Mino-Wrap is designed to allow the temporary tissue expander to be inflated without any restrictions, and to aid in the prevention of infection and biofilm formation on the implant over longer durations than current practice.

  
The current standard of care (SOC) can be improved upon and infection rates reduced.

Question for this group, I bought bull spreads spreads last week on Tuesday, sold 100 12Cs (the 70 cent premium was insane relative to the 80 cent premium on 9Cs) and bought up and down the chain lower strikes (most 9cs, 7.5cs and 5cs) as those seemed to have the best price spreads. Thoughts on whether it behooves me to close out some or all of those 12s, and potentially the best strategy for doing so? All my spreads will be massive wins (assuming the DD plays out and it gamma squeezes to 12+), even notwithstanding the cap on upside potential those 12cs represent, but on the other hand I am wondering if it may be worth eating the cost of those 12cs to preserve more upside potential.",rkatzz,8,/r/pennystocks/comments/o50xk3/atos_dd_gamma_storm_pt_2_ticking_time_bomb/h2kudub/,0.031,0.83,0.139,0.9449

34,DD," I set pretty realistic price points for pennys. All my other pennys I would top out at 50% or maybe 100% on some of my luckier ones.

I view HLOGF differently because it's not just a pennystock. If they get what they're after, they could essentially become the largest helium producer in the world. That isn't something to scoff at. Companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are stashing helium in stockpiles due to the shortage.

Almost all of my other pennystocks will be forgotten after I exit the position. Helium One, assuming they get what they're after, will become a worldy company. It won't be a household name, but it'll be known by governments and major companies around the globe.

With that said, these are the scenarios I'm eyeing.

They continue to drill for three months, and are unsatisfied with their findings. Either they need to relocate their drilling or they need to run more seismic evaluations. Whatever the case, they'll need to delay, and that's a death sentence for the SP. However, I believe hype alone would generate a decent return. Remember, they have 3 chances to deliver updates, and any solid update will help. I believe even if everything fails, we should still peak out at around $.50 - $.70usd before the final bad news that they have to readjust their drill program.

However, if everything is delivered as expected. All three 3 drills look good and provide good solid samples of helium, I believe we'll see some major gains. I wouldn't be surprised if we hit $2.50 by September if they find what they want. You gotta look at it from a trading logic. The SP will not reflect the company's worth and hype could drive the SP through the roof. Once evaluation is completed near the end of the year, we'll see some gains and then trade steady for a while before coming back down to more realistic levels.

Now we do have some risks that I believe traders should be aware of. This company as a whole has never drilled. They brought on someone with 30+ years of experience to oversee the program, but just keep in mind their lack of drilling history.

As always, do your own DD. Look at the company. Look at the current state of helium and current reserves. Then you can make a better decision on whether to invest or not.

The reason RECAF is continuing to destroy is because it is pointing to more of what Jarvie (their main geologist) was originally thinking and that is 120+ BILLION barrels in the ground.  If you take conservative estimates he himself quoted as 5-8% usually recoverable that lands as anywhere from 6-10 BILLION barrels.  If (big IF) he ends up being right then RECAF blows EVERY other oil play out of the water.  No argument there. It is up to RECAF to prove it now.  So far everything they though as been playing out but who knows until we know.

The numbers used for RECAF are from 3rd party estimates from the available data BEFORE drilling even started with no drilling in this basin's history as far as I know.  So not even sure how they gave 1 BILLION as an estimate.  I would have given it a big ????.  

If RECAF hits it is a once in a lifetime play.  If they miss then you either have numbers like that are presented here or maybe nothing at all.  If you like max risk and return RECAF is the play.  

Question folks have to ask is if they had only an aeromagnetic survey to go on and hit oil on the the very first well EVER in this basin it either means they are either VERY lucky or there is so much oil it is like hitting water falling out of a boat.

You should be able to do a bit of looking and you'll start to see some of the good names get mentioned by repeatedly by places you've heard or, instead of listening to some guy on reddit named yologangbang or some shit.

There are some really good subs out there also, places where people will be legitimately helpful to honest and thoughtful questions. I AM NOT bashing this sub at all, but it might not be the best place to get newbie questions answered.
