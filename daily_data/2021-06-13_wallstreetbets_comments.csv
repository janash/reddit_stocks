61,AI," Although annoying how often Elon comments on B T C. Tesla is not merely a car company, its more so an AI and energy company. Investing in Tesla is investing in artificial intelligence tech that will power autonomous cars, drastically changing personal travel (cars will then also be a platform for entertainment like your iphone- 30% of Apple’s revenue is generated from the app store) as we know it today but also be licensed across other industries. It is investing in batteries that will power cars, but also store energy for all. The issue with power consumption and peak energy usage amongst large scale utility companies is there’s no way to store enough energy no matter how its generated. Tesla has engineered batteries down to the chemistry to manufacture industry leading battery tech. They are already and will deliver more utility scale power grids projects. Check out the ones like South Australia’s Hornsdale Power Reserve powering 50,000 homes, in Hawaii, in NorCal, in Texas and more. So yeah Tesla’s coming for the utility companies too.

Also forgot to mention when Tesla perfects their full-self driving tech (its excellent already btw) then they’ll deploy robo taxis taking market share away from uber and lift.  So many bright revenue channels ahead for Tesla I can’t even name them all.

No wise investor would overlook Tesla’s roadmap ahead.",siestafiestawarrior,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nym5xv/what_do_i_win/h1n6t1d/,0.04,0.791,0.169,0.9844

Just going by the indicators (Greeks and IV Rank) I would buy calls AND puts. A Leaps straddle.   
  
A 620 Call/put long Leap straddle (17 June 2022) will cost you $27,000 right now.   
At its peak (March 2021) it was worth $55,700.   
BUT, it has little to no volume, so you’d be stuck with it for a long time. 
  
The stock price is unlikely to stay where it is going forward, the stock is too volatile. So betting on either a big drop or rise is the best bet. 
Basically playing for Volatility and not worrying about direction.  
  
You’d lose if:  
- The stock price doesn’t move.   
- IV stays low, or decreases.   
- The stock price bounces around but ends up in the same spot.   
 - Theta kills your gains.   
  
You’d win if:  
- Volatility increases, regardless whether the stock price goes up, down or sideways.  
- Stock price drops or rises dramatically. 
  

But personally I’m sticking with AMC, GME, SPCE and CLNE.

85,FSD," If FSD is possible, Tesla will most likely be the first to achieve it as it is billions of miles ahead of the competition and exponentially increasing their lead due to all of the data collection they have in each car they sell. 

They are ripe to completely disrupt long haul trucking and ride sharing once FSD is sufficient. Of course FSD is no trivial task, but they are essentially crowd sourcing the cost of MASSIVE data capture through car sales.

It is overvalued based on where they are at now, but if they achieve FSD they wreck Uber and Lyft plus semi manufacturers. Rideshare is a $100 billion industry, and class 8 trucks is $360 billion industry.

So would they keep FSD for themselves as a competitive edge? Or do they license it to other car manufacturers for several thousand per car sold? Do the licensing math.

Everything rides on Tesla completing FSD to reach their potential, which would revolutionize transportation. But they are the best positioned to do so.",Thetek9,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nym5xv/what_do_i_win/h1lit2c/,0.036,0.901,0.063,0.6966

238,AMC," **When screenshot was taken- AMC was trading at $68.30 per share. So $68.30 - $30 (strike price) = $38.30 per share of the contract. 1 contract = 100 shares.** 



Strike price is $30. 9 buys = 9 contracts. Each contract is 100 shares. So 9* 100 = 900 shares. 

AMC is at $49 and change (for simplicuty- round up to $50). Take the price of a current share and subtract the strike price-- so $50-$30, which = $20 (your profit per share minus the premium- price you paid per share of each contract). 

So profit or gud Green= $20 * 900 shares = 18k. Minus the premium you paid for the call contracts. 

** person has the OPTION (not the obligation) until 06/04/21 to BUY or SELL their options. Most people will sell their rights to exercise the option(s) and take the profit and move on. That's not always the case-- he could buy the underlying shares at $30 per or 900 x $30 (27k plus premium paid for the options).

I think car companies have realized: they aren’t good at making apps. I’m not saying Blackberry can’t do it. All I’m saying is I doubt Blackberry’s ability to execute on their vision.

374,BB," I’m def not an expert or even remotely close to being a teacher. So you’ll have to keep that in mind from my off the cuff explanation. Basically in your example you’re correct. But don’t forget you have the ability to sell that call you bought for a higher premium, example near the end. 

Buying a call is a contract to be able to purchase 100 shares, at whatever strike you chose by the expiration date. Only if the share price is higher than your strike price at close on the date of expiration can it be executed. Some brokers allow early execution as well. 

As an example to show my most recent success with options I give you this, I bought x40 $40 1/22/22 BB calls in March for an average of $52 apiece. So I had just over $2k invested. Two weeks ago I sold those calls for an average price of $620 apiece. That was about $22k in profit. Now let’s say that instead of rocketing up like BB did for me, it crashed hard. Well if by that expiration date of 1/22/22 it still wasn’t close to $40 or even going up, it would basically be worth $0. And I’d have only lost what I invested initially ($2k). 

Now back to present day. I have x120 $13 calls that expire this coming Friday on CLNE. I stand to lose around $12k if I don’t sell those calls by Friday. Now the closer we get to Friday and the share price stays under $13, my premium value of each contract(average of $101 per) will steadily drop. But, if the share price starts to climb like crazy and even pass $13, they raise in premium value. Which I hope is the case of course. This was an extremely risky “bet”, so please don’t tell my wife lol….",Hstevens0527,22,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nyk41x/clne_annual_shareholders_meeting_on_june_14th_9am/h1lf58t/,0.065,0.781,0.154,0.9862

I use a combination of expected news, fundamental analysis, a feel for general sentiment of the company, and the charts before opening my trades.  The charts are probably the least important of those to me.

That said, I'm not shitting on TA.  I think they are one of the factors you should look at, just not the only and not the most important.

I do have a problem with your TA here, though, because I don't feel it gives the most useful information.  You say what it needs to do to break the downtrend but not what the probability is or an expected timeframe of breaking the downtrend.  What good is knowing what has to happen if you don't know how likely it is to happenn or when it will happen?

That's why all the other factors are important, too.

You do at least say when you would open a position, but imo it would be much more useful to me if you said x percent of the time, a stock continues in its downtrend for x amount of months given similar situations, for example.",mis-Hap,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nyhntu/wish_unbiased_technical_analysis/h1ktv9s/,0.031,0.91,0.059,0.8211

NLP isn't going to *know* what ""to the moon"" means, but it can learn that phrase (or the words in it) are associated with being bullish if it sees enough examples of bullish comments with it and bearish ones without. Thing is, that means the model is only going to be as good as the labels/data you give it to learn from. Plus there's an additional layer of abstraction when you try to extrapolate from sentiment to activity. (People may be bullish on a stock but not actually buy it)

I know sentiment analysis *can* be a useful indicator, and it sounds like you've experienced that personally. To say it's consistent... I wouldn't count on it. This sub has been pretty phenomenally wrong in the past, and even when people are calling it right it's possible to lose money on a bet that was directionally correct.

763,CLOV," Could you also do analysis comparing the moves to the  similar moves for American-Multi Cinema and Game at the beginning of their runs? That would give this post more validity. Otherwise it feels like anything gaining momentum outside of the 2 get technical analysis that supports price drops. Can we also relate borrow rates to short interest% as well.. we know that higher borrow rates promote movement to close borrow positions... just a couple of thoughts if this post is for technical analysis.. it seems at times that only the technicals for supporting a particular direction in price movement is shared.  
   Over 100% institutional ownership w.r.t something like CLOV, with tons of options out there.. could there be pressure and a strategy to push those options to a place where they expire out of the money.. so the premiums are collected? Can we look at which institutions may be over leveraged with put options (is that an indication of naked shorting) This week is a critical week (3rd Friday monthly) for options.

I see Monday being a very likely bulltrap before a heavy sell off from further inflation fears this week. Position of 1 former OTM @16 call (sold), now puts @14, 13.5, 11, 10 and 9.

797,TA," Personally, I do value TA (within reason) and disagree that it's BS.

But.

It becomes significantly less valuable when many of the participants in that particular stock are not using TA. In other words, heavy retail meme stocks.

Why?

Technical Analysis is a self fulfilling prophecy. If enough people accept or acknowledge that a stock has a support, resistance or trend line, and they're trading off that, then all of a sudden that TA is very valuable.

The more common the TA indicators are, in theory, the ones that will provide the most reliability because they are the ones that people are using which will create trends.

The big problem with TA is that algos the big institutions use will take advantage of that and play around them to catch retail and smaller institutions out.

I don't use TA to make trading decisions per se, but I do use it to identify stocks that are more likely to breakout, where I should look at buying or selling based off previous support or resistance levels.

This is all more for day and swing trading though. For investing, it makes sense to approach it slightly differently. In part, because it's a lot more long-term and fundamentals will be more applicable to the decision.

You probably know all of this, but in case anyone else is reading and is curious about TA I thought I'd write a slightly more detailed response.",INTERNET_D0CT0R,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nz1p5g/technical_observations_for_multiple_stocks_being/h1nkxbw/,0.021,0.856,0.123,0.9763

842,DD," Have you done DD about whats going on with China (biggest steel producer in the world)? They're cutting capacity to reduce carbon emissions and go ""greener"", removed export rebate, and rumors are theyre about to implement export tax. 

Yes, prices will go down, but the thesis is that prices will remain elevated to a point where all these non chinese steel makers will still be printing $$$ big time.

Throw in the fact that there will inevitably be countries around the globe pushing for infrastructure spending to restart their economies from the covid impacts.. US is the first, and maybe the biggest.. but Russia, India, bunch of Asian, and South American will probably follow too.

I personally do not think prices will plunge, or that the supply demand situation will be resolved anytime soon.

Yes I understand there is some irony involved... but this is a boomer stock and not going to get pumped by WSB. 

In essence, OP thinks AMD will break out to NVIDIA levels because they are going to essentially sell more PS5s... which are low margin products not remotely comparable to NVIDIA datacenter chips. There are videos of computer engineers BEGGING Nvidia to drop prices because they are forced to buy. That is a company with seriously moat and have continued to milk the fuck out of their clientele. AMD trades at a lower P/E because it's in the business of selling PS5s (and barely has any capacity for CPUs to meet demand) and doesn't have hopes to ever compete with Nvidia's market.

Intel can barely compete with AMD on the CPU front. They are getting trashed in the DataCenter. Just read about Epyc servers and see how they absolutely STOMP Xeons.

In the latest Intel report, they admitted that they aren't growing in Datacenter... while AMD grew double digits. That's because they are eating Intel's lunch.

On the consumer front, just look at the Amazon sales stats: [https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computers-Accessories-Computer-CPU-Processors/zgbs/pc/229189](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computers-Accessories-Computer-CPU-Processors/zgbs/pc/229189)

Nvidia is buying ARM cause they want to get into the CPU world.

Nvidia and AMD compete in the EV space (as AMD won Tesla, after Nvidia lost them).

On the GPU front and parallel accelerators, it is AMD vs NVIDIA.

Nvidia overtook Intel in Market Cap this year... they are the dog to beat.

AMD took over consoles (overtaking Nvidia) and now they took EV, while aiming to acquire Xilinx and solidify their position.

So yeah, do your diligence. AMD and NVIDIA compete on parallel processing (GPU & Graphics). This means Ampere and Turing (from Nvidia) compete against Big Navi (AMD). Try to find a RTX 3080 or a 6800XT at MSRP.... GOOD LUCK with that!

They also compete in software, e.g. Fidelity FX Super Resolution (AMD) vs. Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS from Nvidia).

They both have outsourced production (Fabless) and they both compete to manufacture through TSMC.

Do your diligence before writing a comment.

People are willing to spend more money for better tech. And AMD is cashing in on it.

50% revenue growth year over year!!!... How much did intel revenue grow????

Apple proved people are willing to pay $1500 for top of the line iphones.

Better tech will ALWAYS be worth more money. Intel has now become CHEAP.

The notion that a 16 core CPU with 192mb of 3D cache is worth $700 is RIDICULOUS.

Wait and see what AMD charges for their Zen 3 chips with stacked cache... and how impossible it becomes to buy one.

You think cheap wins???... Why aren't people buying pentiums then???

Intel is actually losing the war... that's why they had to hire their 3rd Top General (Gelsinger) within 5 years... after Swan and Krzanich s#at the bed.

Dude... Biden is getting Trillions, with a T.

Biden ALREADY has higher approval rating than Trump ever did....

Why do you think that is????....

You pump trillions into any economy... the results will be obvious.

The VAST majority of people still believe in Government Institutions.

Look at what happened after the January 6th attack on the Capitol.

The crazies (led by an orange clown) had to go into hiding....

The Vast majority of people support democracy, support their government and are finally willing to call-out the anti-vaxers, flat earthers and racist karens.

Derek Chauvin will spend a LOOOONG time in prison.

The notion that the rhetoric spread by a loud minority will develop is BS.

The American People woke up to their worst nightmare... a Fascist Running their country... and they THREW HIM OUT.

The District Attorney of the Southern District of New York had ""residential real-estate"" reserved for an orange clown.

This results in the middle class having a shot at a decent living again.

Bezos being called out for his trip to space is just the beginning.

The middle class is coming back... and so will affordable living for the vast majority.

There is a TON of money waiting to be spent.

The last pandemic was in 1920 (Spanish flu). Look at what happened from 1920 to 1939.

Almost 2 decades of uninterrupted growth.

Central Banks have pumped money to keep humanity afloat.

**EVEN Republicans** supported money being given to people so they stay a HOME.

Republicans wouldn't be caught dead giving a penny to anyone who doesn't break their back working. Yet they signed thousands sent to people to stay at home.

Zen 3 with 3D cache... is revolutionary.

Gaming in the EV world (with autonomous driving)... is revolutionary.

Gaming on a 5700G or 5600G without a discrete card... revolutionary.

Anyhow, 1 hr and 52 mins after I ordered, it was on my doorstep. Delivery process and experience was identical to Amazon, except it surprised me by being way early.

Also President Biden won’t be looking for domestic lithium supplies in an effort to make the environmentalists happy.

1414,CVS," Not unless Amazon starts negotiating with insurance companies as an exclusive provider. Our insurance requires us to use CVS for Rxs. This includes their specialty dept. Amazon has the money to do this, but it’s more to why? Most of Amazon’s business has been in newer areas: E-Commerce, streaming, Smart tech.,  etc. The retail pharmacy (including home delivery) is already built by these companies. People also like the ability to go to an actual store for something as important as an RX or other medication. Those that don’t can have it shipped already. 

In other words, Amazon can’t bring much to the market that isn’t already there. That means Amazon is forced to negotiate with insurances, gather a team of pharmacists to fill the Rxs, market to people/companies to use them and more. Amazon would spend a ton of money and resources in a market that is already fully developed and is competing against giants already established. It would be high risk spending.

Amazon ultimately probably needs to split into three parts and the great thing about that is you wind up with a pure cloud play if they do it fast they can beat IBM’s break up toward the end of this year or early next year.

In the past I’ve received prescriptions in the mail and via other carriers and they’re either left in the mailbox or simply left out but they weren’t controlled substances which I’m assuming I would hope have actual signature required.

We have Luxer lockers in my building but packages often wind up in the one big shared locker where they got pilfered or laying around outside the lockers because the lockers are full or because the delivery people don’t know how to deal with the lockers. 

Finally I have observed homeless people selling prescriptions apparently prearranged to people in nice cars. Hell I even saw a sign on the back of a road sign nearest CVS that said “will buy insulin call (number)”

I haven't looked at them in years.  USWest, Qwest, CenturyLink, and now Lumen.  Same regime...new names.  Never seem to get their shit together.  Had massive amounts of debt, and then they bought someone with even more debt (Level3)....which had made a recent acquisition of floundering Time Warner Telecom...which had absorbed failing XO Communications.
From a customer perspective...Level3 was awesome for IP Core stuff.  Since being acquired...customer service and repairs suck *as.  Their competitors are constantly underbidding them on price too.  Circuit delivery times have grown exponentially.
My last reason...I know someone that is a lifelong sales gal.  She's always been ahead of market in following the potential sales money.  She recently bailed from Level3 to join one of the mega-tech companies.  One that is currently taking large pieces of traditional telecom away from the sector.  You'll have to guess who.

Maybe there is some upside there...seem to have quit borrowing and are paying off debt....but my couple of decades around that industry tell me to stay away from companies with piles of debt.

AMC is now \~50. If you buy a call option at like 85, the cost is \~5. So AMC doubles to 100, then how much do you make:

(100 - 85) / 5 = 3x

Ok. You triple your money if the thing doubles. (After AMC has already increased by 10x)

&#x200B;

TWNK has not even doubled once. You can by 30 strikes, and if it doubles to 33, then you would be getting 10x-20x. 

&#x200B;

So yeah, TWNK call options are more expensive than they were a week ago, but they still offer way better payout than anything that has actually run hard. If it pretty much impossible to get those kinds of returns from AMC, BB, CLNE, CLOV, GME...

&#x200B;

You make insane money on options by buying them BEFORE the stock explodes. And TWNK has definitely not exploded yet. 

Once the thing explodes the price for the options get jacked up enormously because everyone already realizes the price can get stupid.

&#x200B;

1507,TA, You spend all this time reading the chart and drawing on it only to have “is this the top of B wave?” Meaning if you bought puts now then they burn with theta in case it’s not the top of B. So how can you trade this with any conviction?

1508,RIDE," We finally get a post on WSB and it’s all about a 4.89 low price target from 11.41.  Why isn’t there a chart that just trades this thing sideways until the next catalysts? So sick of shorts shorting, and the puts printing on RIDE every time it shows any progress. It only went to 8.91 on FUD, that re-emerged with price at 15.81 on a recycled fear about a startup that needed some money to reach “full scale” production of the Endurance.",StockGalifinakis,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nyvpvj/elliottwave_for_ride/h1n1zap/,0.135,0.82,0.045,-0.8328
1509,GM," No that was just fake reporting. They made the decision to build their frames in house because steel and everything has gone up so it was going to hurt their margins. (Plus GM left them a lot of robots used for that so it wasn't that expensive) 

They also bought all the microchips for their cars up front because they didn't want to run out like some other manufacturers. 

So basically those 2 things made them spend more money (which they opted to do because they know a loan is coming, they just can't disclose it). And they said ""if we do not get more funding we will make 1000 less trucks this year, but if we do then full production is back on"".

The loan is a govornent ATVM loan which Is the best money you can get so that's why they are waiting and not just taking an asset loan on their factory which they could do in a heartbeat.
