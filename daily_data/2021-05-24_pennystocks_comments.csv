0,TD," I said this before when TD ameritrade issued that they wouldn't allow you to buy stocks that are caveat emptor and I'll say it again. You can do whatever you want with your money but why would you wanna invest in stocks that can't keep their financials up to date?

That's why, in order for CBDD to ever get to $1, they'd have to either have massive income/assets to justify the valuation, or, and this is the most likely scenario, consolidate shares to below or around 1 billion.

75,CPE," The truth is nobody really knows what is going up or down regardless of fundamentals.  Agree with everyone that you should do your own research but yeah sometimes it doesn‚Äôt make sense at first glance.  A premarket jump can quickly drop if bag holders are looking for an exit (SPCE today), not to mention meme stocks taking over fundamentals.  Penny stocks often depart from fundamentals and are more event-driven like you mentioned, like DGLY and BLM protests.  Sometimes in penny stocks it‚Äôs all about it being new and not yet jumped.  Also, boomer books teach ‚Äúrule of 72‚Äù for a target of 6% per year to double in 12 years, but if I‚Äôm up 100% after a few days then ain‚Äôt no way I‚Äôm holding for the long term (and buying after the price jump can lead to holding a loss for years as profits are taken by early investors).

As a rule, if it‚Äôs got traction on Twitter then it‚Äôs too late.  Not always true but in general keeps me safe from P&D.

Definitely check the Redditor‚Äôs account age.  I usually never trust new accounts as this group became visible to scammers in 2020 (at least on a large scale).  Again not always true, but it‚Äôs good to know post history is solid.  I have 2 Redditors I follow and believe in but neither is a crystal ball so don‚Äôt get mad if they‚Äôre wrong (again, nobody really knows).

If it‚Äôs a biopharma play I check the calendar https://www.biopharmcatalyst.com/calendars/pdufa-calendar.  Nothing like a known catalyst date to get in early on, just beware the offerings that can happen during your 1-2 month hold.  Check company‚Äôs cash on hand before investing too much, or take a small position that you add to if it dips.  Working good for me on ITRM (bought $1.16, doubled own at $0.96, and in the green with a July catalyst I‚Äôll sell sometime in June).

If it‚Äôs an industry catalyst I Google it (Colonial Pipeline shut down made money on CPE/KMI etc.).  Also weekend news helps (Virgin Galactic news broke Saturday so we knew it was going up and I had a $22.00 limit buy that didn‚Äôt fill but sometimes these do and they usually print gains).

Anyone can post anything on any public forum whether it is true or not so if you don't do some work on your own they you are going to lose all your money.

82,DD," I wouldn't pay for a course since most of that can be found for free. Reading charts and learning the technicals for OTC stocks can be valuable but not something you should find yourself paying for unless you really like that person's style of teaching from the free clips you've seen from them.


As for following other peoples' DD and picks, it can work successfully ***if*** you have really good judgement and a somewhat decent understanding of what could make for a promising stock or big gainer. Outright blindly following some picks is not advisable at all though. With poor judgement you might find yourself in some overhyped companies with bloated share counts and unimpressive leadership. 


Also, as knowledgable and good as some people are when it comes to picking big gainers, they won't be able to help you with a price target to sell before a dip. Everyone's strategy is different and depends if you're swinging it, in the stock for the long term, or want to shave profits at high points and buy back cheaper to stay long-term.",tsnpd,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/njuouv/is_it_enough_to_read_dd_posted_by_others_on/gzatb02/,0.035,0.765,0.2,0.9865
