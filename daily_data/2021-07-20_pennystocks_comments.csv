0,DD," To those who are not aware take time to read through the DD that we have on this Reddit page! Click on my name and go back two months and read all the court filings posted. Click on Tomkilla and others names and look at the DD posted openly for all to see. Then realize that last year in June of 2020 Netlist was victorious in a 12 year battle in the patent courts against Google! A 3 judge panel at the US court of appeals, in a unanimous rule 36 decision, upheld the decision of the lower court and found in favor of Netlist. Google ""Waived"" their appeal rights to the SCOTUS and in February of this year the 912 patent was reissued with 78 claims upheld. Next we won against SK Hynix and now they are our partner. The Hynix deal included a 40 million signing bonus, a 600 million dollar supply agreement at advantageous terms, a patent sharing agreement that gives netlist access to Hynix portfolio of 5000 patents free of charge, and now Hynix is our partner to bring our CXL compatible Hybridimm product to market later this year!! The deal with Hynix is so good that analyst consensus estimates are anticipating a 1400 % to 1700 % increase in EPS in q2!! CFO stated in last annual ER that she anticipated similar numbers of plus 23% on revenue for the first half as compared to 4th qtr last year. Read through this Reddit page do your DD.

Given the current market cap and outstanding shares (330m total, 256m restricted, 74m unrestricted) This gives us the range I listed. 

The range was calculated with $60 oil in mind and they have about $10-12 in operating costs.
