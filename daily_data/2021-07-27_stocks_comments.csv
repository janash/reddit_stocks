12,OR," >COVID is done if you don't watch the news

Yep, that's exactly the issue.

&#x200B;

You can either end COVID by taking measures to end COVID (i.e. getting the vaccine) OR you can end COVID by pretending it doesn't exist.


It's only going to get worse in those areas where people are refusing to get the vaccine. The virus will mutate amongst the unvaccinated and form variants that are more deadly, contagious, and resistant to the vaccine. We are already seeing it with the Delta variant.

&#x200B;

Like I said, COVID is over in NJ because a majority of the population is vaccinated. COVID is over in these deep red states because people don't pay any attention to it... but it is still ravaging their populations, it is not at all over and won't be any time soon.

The deaths will be on the hands of those who refuse to get vaccinated.

32,BABA," The specific companies that are being targeted by the government and its reasons aren't exactly out of the ordinary. Most major companies have been fined for breaking anti-trust policies in the US, in Europe, everywhere (Google got fined $2.7B in 2017, Citibank got fined $1B the same year, etc.) and the Chinese government is now doing the same. BABA first, then Tencent is denied the right to control the music industry, the two biggest gaming platforms cannot merge together. The government wants to allow competition to challenge big players. What probably came at a bigger surprise is the new law regulating education, but there's no sign or report that the same will happen to other industries. As a matter of fact, the Chinese government could've made a stronger example out of BABA a couple month ago, but didn't. It's simply not in the country's interest to eradicate foreign investment and legal structures in place to attract money that companies need to raise to grow and develop tomorrow's technologies. Claiming that BABA can be nationalized now after months of scrutiny by the Chinese government and a relatively low fine is just silly.

Overall, it looks like an overreaction across the board as always. If the EU did the exact same thing with some listed company, including nationalizing educational companies, it wouldn't have made national news. Americans (mainly), who hate on China as it's easier to point your finger at a strong common enemy than recognize that your country lost its shine because your own socialist policies killed the competitiveness of your industries, crawl out of the sewer to vent, insult and lecture about politics. But besides education-related companies, the fundamentals and long-term future of BABA and other Chinese companies isn't really impacted (unless you own shares of struggling companies that will need additional funds soon while their stock is down).

However, for those worried about these turbulences, Chinese stocks are probably not for you. They do react violently to any news. You see tickers at -10-15% today, and after a few weekends without political news from China, they'll probably go right back up, just as fast. They're just not for everyone and thorough due diligence is required.

Now, for those outraged about nationalizing education-related companies, start a business delivering regular mail to Americans and talk to us about freedom once they've thrown you in jail. Besides mailing, you can pick any country and find legal state monopolies. France has nationalized the lottery, horse racing, electricity, rail transportation and more. And yet, no one's scared of owning French companies, or hate the country as a whole because the US didn't lose its rank to any European country...",wasinwill,70,/r/stocks/comments/os8h67/unpopular_opinionalibaba_isnt_going_anywhere/h6najos/,0.12,0.791,0.09,-0.9731
33,JD," The problem with buying the dip right now in Chinese stocks is that we truly do not know the length or severity of what the CCP intends to do with these companies. OP said it might take ""weeks/months"" for these stocks to recover, but the truth is that it could also take *years*. Or it may never happen at all. Maybe the CCP takes them over and nationalizes them and turns all these companies into the equivalent of public utilities. Then their stock price will stagnate forever.

If the CCP is trying to reign in big tech, big data, and big money — as many U.S. investment firms now believe — then this crackdown is only beginning. We don't know for sure what's going on over there, but the important part here is perception.

U.S. firms certainly believe that worst-case scenarios are now likely. That's why Wall Street has begun de-risking from these stocks.

44,PT," $BABA will be leaps for me. If it works out, huge gains, if it doesn’t, fine I won’t be hanging around bagholding. CCP is posturing on their big tech, that’s all it is, the fine they gave them was a drop in the bucket against the $50B+ in cash on hand. Americans don’t seem to understand that Alibaba is quite literally the backbone of the Chinese economy, and a key driver of both technological advancement which China is desperate for. They are vital in transforming China from a country of rural poor to one of middle class consumers. 

CCP has partnerships with Alibaba. Are they demonstrating control? Sure. Are they enforcing antitrust more than the weak US justice system ever will? Yep. Would I ever recommend investing in a Chinese IPO or something without independently audited financials? Hell no.

But $BABA is here for the long haul, in an incredibly advantageous position to capitalize on the fast growing middle class in the world, in an economy that may soon be the largest in the world. The ADR argument is pure FUD, if China were to just steal American investments in their stock exchange, we would be at war.

And that’s what I hold Lockheed for.

China doesn’t even needed western investment. They have enough dollars flowing into their country from exporting iPhones and everything else we consume in the west without caring about investment dollars. The CCP don’t even want foreign investment, hence why the VIE structure is needed.

You're right in that they already have the capital. That's not the point (I do, however, think your thesis regarding ""someone else buying the dip"" is debatable).

The point is this: If you're invested, you want the company to succeed. Wall St (and to a lesser degree retail) will root for BABA (or whatever other Chinese company) if they're co-owners. They will be more likely to support the business, less critical, and will lobby for them.

122,BABA," When you invest in a Chinese company like Alibaba in the US you actually invest in a holding company which has a contract with the Chinese company granting them rights to a share of their profits.

You're right that you don't own the Chinese company directly, but you do own something that has a legal right to the profits of that Chinese company. Of course, what those rights mean in practise when theoretically the CCP could nationalise the company tomorrow if they want is debatable.

Both narratives are wrong here. Chinese stocks like BABA and JD are neither safe to own or worth nothing. They're relatively risky bets on future of Chinese tech with the assumption that the CCP is smart enough not to do something economically very silly. I've said before the real risk of owning Chinese stocks is probably not from China, but from US regulation. China and Chinese companies benefit from foreign investment, to be too punitive risks future investment in China. However the US doesn't really benefit from opening their exchanges to Chinese companies. Investments in Chinese stocks are risky for US investors and they allow Chinese companies easier access to US capital. There are a lot of incentives for the US to delist these companies, but in the event of a delisting it's worth remembering that it would be possible to exchange your shares for equivalent shares traded on the Hong Kong stock exchange so your investment won't go to $0, even if there will be significant short-term volatility in the event of a delisting.

There is a reason these stocks trade at extremely discounted multiples. The market understands there is a risk in owning them, yet many investors feel confident that the CCP isn't stupid enough to start screwing with their most innovative companies. This last few weeks has challenged that narrative which is why Chinese stocks have dropped sharply, but I'd personally still bet in favour of strategically and economically important companies like Alibaba being able to continue to grow so long as they don't upset the CCP. At the end of the day the CCP needs these companies to remain competitive with the US.

124,GDP," U.S stocks have been reaching all time highs.
Chinese stocks have cooled off since Q1 2021.
China beat U.S corporate earnings and GDP growth by around x3,x4.
With the VIE you still recieve dividends. The chances of Chinese stocks being delisted by the PCOAB due to non compliance for 3 consecutive years is not going to happen. The FUD for Chinese education stocks aren't rational either. The crackdown on Chinese techs is what the U.S is trying to do but has failed at. If you're worried, invest on Chinese stock exchanges.

To me it appears that China is doing a better job at governing during times of uncertainty and critical divergences. The next years will decide who leads globally. China must enforce strict cooperation to win the security of global dominance. The U.S is too busy counting how mant genders they have and letting the financial system go through euphoria after euphoria. Imo this is the opium war 2.0 except China is the dealer and the U.S is the buyer. And the opium is Chinese goods/labor. The controlled yuan allows China to stockpile there warchest. This allows them to expand on the belt and road along with building there infrastructure. So I do invest in Chinese companies that align with the government policies. I don't fear delisting because the FUD has been cyclical and China has too much leverage over the U.S.

You may not like or agree with anything the Chinese government is doing.

134,BABA," The quality of life in China is directly linked to companies like BABA which facilitate payments and run ecommerce platforms like Taobao. The CCP can't just do whatever they like to these companies otherwise they risk angering their consumers which will actually destabilise their control on power if anything. There is a balancing act here. They need to flex enough power to show who is in charge, but not enough that the risk significant push back inside China.

Similar things happened in Europe when we had monarchies. The monarch might be able to do whatever they wanted on paper, but in reality if they angered their subjects enough they would revolt. China isn't a democracy, but that doesn't mean people are powerless there. Part of the reason the CCP has been able to maintain their power is because there is an unwritten contract between the citizens of China and the government. So long as the CCP run the country well they will be tolerated by the citizens.

Again, this doesn't mean the the CCP won't end up doing something really stupid, it's possible they might do, but it wouldn't make sense for them do a lot of the things people here are worried about when investing in China. For all their criticisms so far the CCP have ran China fairly well and they seem to be competent. Recently I have become more concerned, but I still feel like it's far more likely this is just a temporary flex of power to show who's in charge.

148,JD," Chinese companies will do well in the long term, but investors need to buy them on Chinese exchanges: Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong.  

The endless friction between the US and China has passed the point of no return.  After being hit with tariffs, de-listings, and endless accusations from Washington, the Chinese are economically disengaging from the US.  The short term consequences will be painful, but the long term will be beneficial for China and crippling for America.  

I like Tencent, Alibaba, and JD in particular, but investors need to find new ways to own these stocks.  Interactive Brokers lets clients buy stocks on multiple foreign exchanges, completely bypassing the outdated American ADR system.  There may be other brokerages that offer this as well.

167,GS," I've written about him here previously. It usually gets buried if any wsb or video game retailer person sees it and calls in an air strike.

Shortest version: he's a genius savant and a narcissist.  I say that more as a clinical description than an insult.  

I've known ""of"" him since the 90's when I did a stint on Wall Street.  He was a legend who was rumored to have a wild temper, screaming, throwing things, etc.  No idea if true or just gossip.  People whispered about when he was going to have a heart attack.  His portfolios seemed to have a knack for avoiding corrections by being liquid at the right times.  GS, where he landed, was considered to be the biggest of the big leagues, and he basically did a speedrun to a top spot there.  As a woman in that industry, I should have paid more attention as I can see in hindsight now that he was more willing to work with women than most in his position.  

The TV show you see today is super tame to how it used to be.  It was almost unwatchably weird.  He'd throw things, bite the heads off dolls, smash things with hammers, run them through blenders.  The music was more metal, the camera was flying around constantly, zooming into his eyeballs and back out.  It was crazy. 

Back when he started, he was one of the only people in media who would ever say anything definitive or negative about specific stocks or executives.  It looked unsustainable, like you almost assumed someone would just sue him and bring the spectacle to an end.

""Wall of Shame"" was his staple bit, and every day he'd add or remove executives from the list while lambasting them.  Contrast that with his interviews now, which are mostly cloying and obsequious.  You can still see shadows of young Cramer though, when he sarcastically burns the meme trade trend or the recent debacle with AT&T Warner.

People - enemies especially - misinterpret his ""picks"".  They should be viewed more in a macro sense, like when he says buy to certain oils or sell to certain China stocks, it doesn't mean buy that second, it's more of a guide on what sectors or types of companies should be on the caller's list to transact when the price is right.  

People trying to discredit his track record through analysis use methods that serve their own intent.  They might take his ""buys"" and assess their 6 month performance.  They could be ignoring that he flipped to a sell on it a week or a month later.  He makes part of the problem himself by flip flopping within a short term on some sectors, but it's typically also based on new news or changing winds.  One of the other problems is he views his output wholistically, meaning he thinks about everything he says in the morning, throughout the day, what he writes in articles or says in interviews.  He assumes people have absorbed all of that because that's all in his head.  So he might have said cautious things about ticker xyz several times, with clear caveats, but when critics look they see only one expression during lightning round in which that nuance or balance is absent.  

If you're new to Cramer and stock market investing, there's probably three important things:  

* read one of his books.  He lays out sober strategies for how to be an individual stock market investor.  Have your job and personal budget and emergency fund set up first. Have a ""regular"" retirement plan started.  Have at least $10k in a normal ETF. Then, and only then, do stocks, and do so only with money you can afford to lose, based on your age and earning potential.  Do tons of homework for the stocks you buy, and babysit them constantly.  Read reports, look at competitors, listen to every earnings call.  Don't be afraid to sell them.  Be diversified, which, for a person with a job and a life, and because of the ongoing babysitting requirement, means probably 5 stocks in differing sectors.  
* realize that The Daily Show/Bear Stearns stories you'll inevitably hear are tragically misleading
* Detractors will eventually point you to a highly out of context clip where he describes the shady practices he and every other hedge fund used/uses.  They will do this to deliberately mislead you.  


Bottom line is the Reddit hate against him is the most ironic thing possible.  He's been the only guy from Wall Street who has ever said or done anything in favor of the small time, novice stock market investor.  He's poked holes in the mystique and been their champion since many of them were in kindergarten.  And the reason the whole attack started was because he congratulated and begged them to sell a certain video game ticker at $375, which would have been an all time high for those who listened.",Summebride,2,/r/stocks/comments/osciyr/how_come_cramer_cant_own_stocks/h6qu3r7/,0.075,0.89,0.035,-0.9815

I'm not particularly interested in TSLA regardless, but in the case of a company surpassing financial goals and the price not moving, what WOULD cause it to rise?

The issue is that the CCP has now repeatedly taken steps to rein in Chinese businesses over the past few months, which have cost foreign investors billions of dollars. The steps they've taken have been very aggressive and disruptive, and it means that owning Chinese stocks (well in reality you don't own stock at all, but that's a whole other issue) is extremely risky because their government could at a moments notice tank your holding seemingly on a whim, with no recourse.

Also...were you around for what happened after the Apple and Tesla splits last year? If not, go look at what happened then. Splits didn't equal to them mooning afterward.

419,MMT," Note: Some contrarian view here, sharing for stimulating discussion purpose. 

What OP describes basically tells us how deflationary the current environment is despite the ongoing inflation sentiment. When we think about inflation these days, we are mainly, if not only talking about increase in prices but we don’t realise the following: 

- Inflation means broad-based increase in prices but increase in prices (especially not broad-based) does not necessarily mean inflation 
- We are looking at headline CPI, PCE deflator numbers, those can be a good proxy of potential inflation but it is important to look at what contributed to the headline figures? Is it because of base effect (due to low 2020 numbers)? Is it because certain component in the CPI basket (e.g. used cars)? Is it because of short term supply shock? 
- Over the last few decades/ centuries, the development of technology is one of the major contribution to productivity, and increase in productivity is deflationary in general. Another reason why you see long term 10y yield has been trending lower for decades.

On the policy front, people have always been talking about FED printing money and being “cautious” of hiking interest rate. But look what happened when Powell hiked interest rate starting from late Dec 2017 to late Dec 2018? Eventually they have to cut the interest rate again **EVEN BEFORE** more interest rate cut due to Covid in March 2020. They are not being overly cautious but it is an indication that the system is just too “fragile” (in another words, insufficient inflationary pressure) for rate hikes ever since GFC. As for Powell’s money printing machine via QE, it is empirically true that it will never create sustainable and persistent inflation, otherwise Japan would not be stuck with its negative interest rate for the past 3 decades. Japan isn’t just buying bonds, they are literally buying equity ETFs (Topix ETFs) and yet there is no sign of them having any meaningful inflation.

As for how the future would look like? Like OP has mentioned, we are at the tipping point and whatever FED has done and/ or have been doing, has no sign of creating the kind of inflation that they are looking for. I guess even the policy makers have no idea, otherwise we wouldn’t be in such low interest rate environment since the GFC. 

My speculative answer to OP’s question would be that we would require a different set of tools/ policy other than MMT, QE. And to a greater extent, even a different global monetary system.",EyeOfAgamotto_123,8,/r/stocks/comments/oslv42/someone_help_me_understand_the_directionality_of/h6pjdo6/,0.067,0.783,0.15,0.9898
420,ALL," Ray Dalio's in his books sums it up pretty well. Essentially, the Fed lowers interest rates to stimulate demand. Demand is stimulated through credit creation (and pulling forward demand) from the government and/or the private sector. Credit creation increases the overall level debt in the system. Unless the credit creation creates long term productive investment (long term productivity is declining since the 1970s), the economy is no longer able to support the previous level of interest rates prior to the lowering due to the enhanced debt burden. As such, the new natural rate of interest gets pushed down, cycle after cycle after cycle.

Why does the Fed lower interest rates to stimulate demand? Our system relies on productivity + population, assets and debt. Assets are valued based on future growth assumptions. Growth assumptions occur through assuming future productivity AND working age population levels. Productivity has consistently since 1970's been lower than in the 1970 (brief uptick in the 90s). Populations are now either declining or plateauing in the OECD. Therefore, the value of assets should be lowered as a result. Now here's the rub, when you lower assets (across all areas of the economy as this would be systemic) organizations find it harder to procure more credit creation for growth. Credit creation is essential to growth in our system. So ultimately, the fed steps in to lower interest rates to pull forward demand from the future to increase growth rates today to maintain asset prices.

The reality is, we could have avoided this if in the 1970s we accepted that productivity had declined and taken a decreased value of assets. The economy would have been hurt, but it would have been okay. We are so far along with over a hundred Trillion in world debt that it is too late for that. Unfortunately, with demographics continuing to deteriorate and no uptick in natural productivity on the horizon Japan is the end result for ALL the developed world. Per productivity, think of all the major inventions that happened in the last 120 years. Since 1980s the only sector to continue on a step change path is telecommunications. Electrification/Oil& Gas, Transportation (Roads, Internal Combustion Engine), Consumer Goods/Chemical (ie. Plastics), Sanitation etc. all had the step change pre 1970 with incremental improvements afterwards.",agnchls,3,/r/stocks/comments/oslv42/someone_help_me_understand_the_directionality_of/h6pnwix/,0.088,0.736,0.176,0.9728

426,CLF," The share price doesn’t reflect the sky high steel prices. Steel prices may come down a bit but it’ll take a while since there’s still so much demand from consumers such as automotive companies, construction companies, etc. Funnily enough, I was reading that the company “Whirlpool” (WHR), a company that manufacturers home appliances, is taking big hits and raising product prices due to the soaring costs of materials needed manufacture components. Steel prices aren’t going to fall too much until demand peters out quite a bit and I can only see CLF’s share price rising to reflect that. After all Cleveland Cliffs owns ArcelorMittal which is one of the top three largest steel producers in the world by volume. Rising demand, historic steel prices, and CLF’s position as a vertically integrated steel producer mark this stock as a strong value play. I believe analyst estimates are around 26$ or 27$ but I can see it hitting 30$ tbh

Edit: forgot to mention that the CEO, Lourenco Goncalves, is a fucking champ and knows EXACTLY what he’s doing. CLF used to be an iron pellet producer that was being driven into the ground by the former CEO.
