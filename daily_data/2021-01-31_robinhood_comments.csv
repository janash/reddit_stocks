83,DIS," Exactly.  

Wednesday thru Friday were decent discount days on solid stocks and funds like DIS, ARKK and SMH and tons of others.  I think we're looking at even better discounts this week.  Most of the market was down Friday due to a few factors that I think are at least somewhat related to the GME saga:

1.  Hedge funds with large short positions dumping long plays to cover their shorts.

2.  General fear from older retail investors that the volatility this week is a precursor to a huge correction (which, ironically, WILL actually cause a huge correction).

3.  Related to above ish, that market makers and big funds are fearful that a big correction is coming... also the realization that there's a lot more retail investors out here that are wise to their games and have figured out a way to cash in.  And fear of new regulations and greater scrutiny due to the alleged market manipulation.

Of course, any time I think I've figured out a broad incoming trend I'm wrong about 50% of the time, so take that all with a heaping shovel of salt.  Regardless, the market this week will be WILD!",Ihavean8inchtaint,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/l8lp45/most_anticipated_earnings_releases_for_the_week/glf87rc/,0.099,0.809,0.092,-0.5147

91,CEO," Yeah but unlike Robinhood, Webull CEO went to media to explain what happened and why there were restrictions. They also opened buys to retail same day. Not to say they weren't lying or twisting the story to look better in the public eye. But at least there was an attempt.

They're not my main broker, but I was able to buy 2 shares through them on Monday. Hoping to continue to buy on Monday.",Malhablada,6,/r/RobinHood/comments/l8lp45/most_anticipated_earnings_releases_for_the_week/glf5ohd/,0.0,0.811,0.189,0.9394
