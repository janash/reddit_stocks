0,TD," I listened, I bought in a few weeks ago. I noticed on Thursday that the ticker VRSSF wasn’t in my portfolio, only a placer number. I called TD, rep said that company is changing names and that once it’s complete it will be under a new ticker symbol. I expected by the end of day for my shares to return. It’s Sunday and I still have only a placer number, no ticker and last price update was at $1.03.

7,AI," Yep I read it pretty fast. Btw, just to share with you my opinion. AI is a pretty old field, full of pompous things and in reality it is not such a huge black box (for the math people at least). What makes chatGTP such a marvelous thing is hidden in the actual example from Gates. The advancements in all the fields of science are super huge. Millions of papers that highlight their research are out every year (especially in biology as was the example). There is just one huge problem. There is no expert on this planet capable of assimilating and analyzing all this knowledge. This is why systems like the one from openAI make all those rich people so enthusiastic. Because these systems are necessary in the contex of our modern world and after they will become good enough (I believe 5 years) they will just become the new standard. However, one should be very careful. Text mining for biological data is not a new field of study. It is pretty well developed with a lot of interest from the scientific community. Picking the winner in this race will not be a trivial task for sure.",Eva_Meg,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/129jkvh/the_real_reason_verses_ai_vrssf_is_moving_so_fast/jennkx5/,0.047,0.721,0.232,0.991
8,AI," Agree, GENERATIVE AI is outdated technology.

There are MANY problems with the existing AI..it needs to understand what you're asking, not just ""autocomplete"". It has to use real time info (ChatGPT doesn't), it needs to work across every device AND be accessible.

VERSES has created REgenerative AI (using active inference)..developed with Dr Karl Friston.

If you want to get your geek on, and see why people are so pumped about their AI, watch Dr Karl Friston explain.
