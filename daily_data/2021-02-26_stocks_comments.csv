My theory is that we may see another (perhaps two?) gamma squeeze in the next 1-2 months. Short positions are likely being covered during these squeezes and I don‚Äôt know if new short positions are being opened up that set the stage for the Great Squeeze. That to me also explains the reducing short interest numbers from FINRA since January.

The Great Squeeze to end all squeezes and send the prices to the moon in the 1000s I don‚Äôt think will happen because 1) it could‚Äôve happened during the first go around in January and we got restricted and 2) retailers are now out of the play, it‚Äôs big money vs big money. We simply can‚Äôt bet against big money with retail money. We are not coordinated. We are individuals with personal greed who have varied exit positions working with chump change, relatively speaking. 

Best way to make money now is to ride the wave during these sequentially smaller sized gamma squeezes and exit before seeing the fall.

11,GME," I‚Äôm out I think. I don‚Äôt know enough about investing to play around with GME. It moves too much too fast to keep up with and it eats into my day worrying about it. I didn‚Äôt put more than I could afford to loose into it, but it still caused too much stress. I‚Äôve spent way too much time reading tons of Reddit analysis and trying to perform Due Diligence but the time tables on learning everything has too fast given how quickly GME moves. 

On top of that, almost everyone feels like a malignant actor here trying to get you to sink your money in so they get rich off of you. There‚Äôs too much diamond handing and people insisting that GME somehow is fighting big evil financial institutions. 

I want to thank you for your analysis. It‚Äôs one of the few that is comprehensive and doesn‚Äôt either lie about the data or force the data to meet a narrative they constructed in their head.

Yesterday I impulsed bought on the end of day because of the excessive amount of gamma squeeze posting and I started to panic that I was gonna miss out. I wanted to recoup money I lost from other stocks, so I sold all my ETFs and put it in gme. I didn‚Äôt realize I was gonna get wash selled from when I jumped in on the GME hype train the first time round and then sold before my losses accumulated. Turns by buying back in I became a retroactive bag holder. Dumb thing is I wasn‚Äôt that far off from the wash sell expiration day. Big mistake. Most of my money remains in mutual funds and hopefully they‚Äôll help me slowly recover my GME losses.

40,RH," I cannot stress enough, DO NOT RELY ON THIS STRATEGY of a lot of options being ITM causing a short squeeze by Tuesday of next week. That is exactly what happened last time. I was a participant of the last one. After RH restrictions, we still saw the price climb from around $250 to $325 that Friday. That $320 wall was supposed to be a golden number. It made NINETY THOUSAND options ITM (RH restrictions would not have hindered this). Significantly more than what there is now. And you know what happened that following week? The price dipped, and it dipped hard. Going down to $200 that following Monday, then $100 that following Tuesday. There was no squeeze caused by the call options. That's because they were most likely covered calls, and while stocks changing hands can be good for the stock, it's only good when they're changing hands at a higher price than what the stock is currently at. These stocks, which again, were most likely covered by stocks already bought early on, were changing hands at a price that was already ITM, then being sold at a profit at whatever the price of the stock was at open.

>On May 31, 2012, the SEC approved, on a pilot basis, a National Market System Plan, known as the Limit Up/Limit Down (""LULD"") Plan, to address extraordinary market volatility. The Plan is designed to prevent trades in NMS Stocks from occurring outside specified price bands, which are set at a percentage level above and below the average reference price of a security over the preceding five-minute period. The percentage level is determined by a security‚Äôs designation as a Tier 1 or Tier 2 security. Tier 1 comprises all securities in the S&P 500, the Russell 1000 and select Exchange Traded Products (ETPs). Tier 2 comprises all other NMS securities, except for rights and warrants, which are specifically excluded from coverage. The Plan applies during regular trading hours of 9:30 am ET - 4:00 pm ET.

But again, if you believe in the squeeze thesis, the tax writeoff being carried to the next period shouldn't keep you out of your (foreseen) gains

2) Elon Musk tweets about GME, causing a sharp increase in price before everyone who bought in at $170 yesterday sells and it goes back to being a black hole. 

3) The big boys don't pump the stock, and Papa Elon doesn't tweet about it, so all the retarded retail traders end up buying and selling the shares to each other like a bunch of apes throwing feces in a zoo.

and if you rebuy the same stock again, $75 is added to whatever purchase price you buy. If you don't, then you can claim $75 as tax loss.

95,IMO," Just for a slightly contrarian POV on the current correction.  While history does not repeat I think were getting a bit ahead of the underlying signals.  The Fed is going to keep rates low, the Gov is going to keep printing money.  Solid Tech Companies that did well during the pandemic will keep growing, the next decades remains the era of cloud. (watch the earnings reports, huge growth numbers  in Q4).

A rise in the bond yields signals a healthy recovery or at least inflation is on the rise.  If the economy is indeed recovering I would like to point to the early 1990's when we saw this exact same situation.  And we all know how tech did in that decade.

Will tech take a hit right now?  Sure we were do for a correction!  This is how the market works. **A lot of tech names got pumped that IMO are not worth their weight in beans.**  However there are a bunch of companies that are going to keep growing at crazy rates. Look at Etsy and Pins earnings this week?  Digital Turbine Anyone? and FANGs are not going anywhere, trading at a discount IMO and safe place to park some cash.

There will def be some shifting of portfolios as some of the ""beaten down sectors"" that are traditionally inflation resistant (will call them undervalued relative to the whole market) are going to perform as we come out of the pandemic but  my outlook has not changed in the way I invest and this week was a fire sale in my eyes for the good stuff.  Fast growing, cloud based companies that have a moat around their product will continue to outperform the market (Crowdstrike, Docu Sign, Twillio).  These companies are also inflation resistant as they can raise prices to match inflation w/o issue and there not going to lose any customers.  Could we trade sideways for a bit, or go down even further certainly.

99,IMO," Aggressive rotation into value stocks is a risky play IMO. From listening to macro analysts I get a sense that nobody really knows what will happen in the next 6-12 months. The Fed could step in and put a hard cap on the long-term yields with QE and YCC or they could let them ride higher; how much higher, no one really knows.

Also, inflation could pick up in 2021 or it may not. Some deflationists believe that the long-term rates are at their peak and that bonds will rally. This would be bullish for tech and negative cash flow (growth) companies in general. The opposite i.e. if the yields continue to rise would be less painful for value stocks.

Another thing is value stocks have had a big run-up since Biden's victory in November. Look at XLF, XLE, commodities, cyclicals, etc. They've run up a lot based on vaccinations and reopening but more broadly, higher inflation expectations, and yet we're not seeing a significant uptick in the CPI in the US, EU, or Asia.

Long story short, it appears that value stocks are starting to outperform but beware that anything can change in an instance. All it takes is a monetary intervention from the central banks or a change in fiscal policy from the world's governments.",marilius12,2,/r/stocks/comments/lsyfcs/what_caused_stocks_to_dump_yesterday_the/govtd4n/,0.053,0.901,0.046,0.0922

123,IMO," Thank you so much for your comments and advice. 

> Aggressive rotation into value stocks is a risky play IMO. From listening to macro analysts I get a sense that nobody really knows what will happen in the next 6-12 months. The Fed could step in and put a hard cap on the long-term yields with QE and YCC or they could let them ride higher; how much higher, no one really knows.

I have to start reading more analysts right now, this is all new to me. 

> Also, inflation could pick up in 2021 or it may not. Some deflationists believe that the long-term rates are at their peak and that bonds will rally. This would be bullish for tech and negative cash flow (growth) companies in general. The opposite i.e. if the yields continue to rise would be less painful for value stocks.

> Another thing is value stocks have had a big run-up since Biden's victory in November. Look at XLF, XLE, commodities, cyclicals, etc. They've run up a lot based on vaccinations and reopening but broadly, higher inflation expectations, and yet we're not seeing a significant uptick in the CPI in the US, EU, or Asia.

I did lose some money this week on the new position I'd initiated. I'm taking a more cautious approach now. There aren't a lot of value stocks that are still cheap and are good companies right now, for sure. 

> Long story short, it appears that value stocks are starting to outperform but beware that anything can change in an instance. All it takes is a monetary intervention from the central banks or a change in fiscal policy from the world's governments.

124,IEP," I have been looking at stocks with strong industrial, energy, commodity and financial businesses, free cash flow, low debt, and so on. Stocks that tend to pay good dividends because they are cash machines. So I've bought a lot of those and they are starting to look expensive. 

One example is IEP, Carl Icahn's industrial conglomerate. It's up 23% since the start of the year, even after the selloff, even though it pays something like a 12% dividend. It's really, really well rated by Wall Street. I bought in weeks ago and now it's looking pricey after a good run up. Michael Burry's portfolio has some strong plays in it. Shipping is really strong right now because of the container shipping shortage and some shipping companies are like REITs in that they're cash machines with low debt and steady business. Shipping stocks have mostly continued to climb or didn't tank during this week's selloff. 

But right now, I think I'm loaded up on my interest rate safe stocks and I'm looking at what tech stocks I'm going to buy into during the tech selloff dips. I did buy some Oracle today. They had some great news during the selloff and the stock hasn't really able to benefit from the news yet.

126,IMO," There appears to be a tech bounce today, right now. But it's hard to say whether it's going to be a dead cat bounce (i.e. a bounce before dropping more next week) or whether it's the selloff is at an end. The fact that bond buyers are ""on strike"" and breaking with the federal reserve is a little concerning and I don't know if that's all settled down yet or there will be more panic selling in the bond markets. I'm still trying to figure this out.

There are going to be volatile days between now and the end of Q1 at the end of March, IMO, with plenty of buying opportunities in good stocks that get sold off (like semiconductors in the tech sector sold off this week and they are really solid investments in every way). It really depends on what your risk tolerance is. 

When the market drops a lot, people have margin calls, which means they have to sell off good stocks to pay their broker for leveraged positions that fell too much. It looks to me as if a lot of good stocks were sold off this week due to margin calls, so today might be a good time to pick up some stocks that you believe can't fail and should not go down no matter what this Spring (like some of the good semiconductor stocks, for example, because of the semiconductor shortage and coming subsidies). But it's hard to tell what's going to happen when there are more volatile days to come in the near future.

It really depends on how much you believe in how stable the trading will be this Spring. Certainly it's better to buy after the market drops big time due to some market disruption (like today) than it is to buy when stocks are very high after a good run. But this might be just the start of the selloffs this Spring. So people have to decide where they feel comfortable with the risk vs their confidence in their positions. 

For me, I did buy some Oracle today because it made a big move this week in terms of shifting into cloud technology and it's been upgraded, so there are a couple of reasons why it might be a good time to buy ORCL. I might buy other high-conviction tech stocks (like semiconductors) today, but I'm not sure whether there will be more developments in the bond market crisis so I'm reading about that now.",rhetorical_twix,1,/r/stocks/comments/lsyfcs/what_caused_stocks_to_dump_yesterday_the/goutl9p/,0.057,0.868,0.076,0.4983

131,USA," That's just my 2 cents.

Obviously I am talking from the perspective of someone that invest mainly in ETFs. 10 years from now we wont see the same stocks that today are in the XYZ Robotics ETF but, under the assumptions that the world still exists, I expect that this particular sector will have affected our economies. 

That is why I mentioned the buying opportunities. If you believe that an industry or a sector will be relevant over the next 10 years, there is no point of worrying for 2 weeks of losses. 

Another example is the Clean Energy economy. I am taking a hit in my portfolio because of an investment in a gloabl clean energy ETF. The EU and the USA have plans to invest government funds into this sector. Some of this growth have been already priced in, the 2020 return of this sector has been huge, however I expect that clean energy equities will do better over the next 10-15 years than consumer staples.

134,AAPL," Lets say some random tech company XYZ grows at a consistent 10% a year and they pay about 1% of there total value each year in interest on bonds so after paying the interest they can grow 9% each year. 

If the interest rate jumps to 3% then they can only grow 7% each year. 

Growth tech companies besides a few like AAPL are typically very cash poor so they need loans to grow.  A common bond type is a convertible bond, they company XYZ gets a loan and pays X% interest but the bond is also convertible; the lender can convert the bond loan into XYZ company shares. But when this occurs the company shares get diluted since X number of shares have just been created. When bond rates rise, the company XYZ either has let more shares be created or accept the higher interest. 

I'm not an expert & I don't know how common convertible bonds are compared no other types but its a good example I think since it shows how a companies stock & its ability to raise capable are linked. In some ways its a good thing, in the event of a bankruptcy, most bonds are actual loans that have to be repaid before remaining equity is distributed to shareholders.",PrinceMachiavelli,2,/r/stocks/comments/lsyfcs/what_caused_stocks_to_dump_yesterday_the/govefvq/,0.027,0.758,0.216,0.99

142,AAPL," The reason I/bears think AAPL can take a long time to reclaim it's ATH is not because it isn't growing as a company, but because the growth is priced in at this point. In other words the value of the company has exceeded the rate at which it's growing. 

If we take a look back in history, we can jump to a hot time in 2007. For context, in July of 2007, the first iphone was released. By December the value of AAPL's share had reached a high of $7 per share (I assume it has split many times until now so ignore the small number). However, AAPL wouldn't reach this price again until just around 2 years later (Dec 2007 - Oct 2009). Now obviously this looks like cherry picking data and I picked one of the worst times in recent history for apple. And the lull was *only* 2 years.

However if we hold a general sentiment that a market crash is right around the corner then expecting apple to take a long time to recover is reasonable. And if we look at some metrics related purely to apple, such as the notorious P/E ratio, we see that [Apple's P/E](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio) ratio currently is the same as it was before the 2008 crash. If you don't like PE ratio because the company can be re-investing in themselves (thus lower earnings despite strong value), then the P/S ratio is just as revealing, showing that Apple's P/S ratio is significantly higher than it was at it's height in 2007. (just change the tab on the macrotrends site). In fact, all of the valuations for AAPL are really high compared to how they normally run with numbers only matching those of 2007 (at least within the last 15 years). 

So yeah, I think Apple is overvalued. I'll pick it back up if it hits like, $100 or something. The thing is that many bulls are convinced that Apple is purely a good company and no valuation is too high because it'll eventually go up...which is probably true. But if I suspect that the stock might tank for 2 years, then I'm ok holding some cash for the time being and bringing my investments elsewhere. 

Also this phenomenon is not only affecting Apple as it is affecting virtually every growth/tech company in the recent years. So I finished selling all of my tech on Monday/Tuesday and have been trimming the positions over the last couple weeks.

152,GME," Very much agreed, it feels like a precarious moment to go all-in.  I figure it's good to buy in gradually, but either way we are getting some skin in the game during a period of extreme volatility.  We get to learn early on what it feels like to hold through wild ups and downs.  

I'm new too and took a nice win on GME --  There's a danger in letting that warp our perceptions of how the market normally works.  Retail traders benefitted from an information imbalance which normally functions in the exact opposite way.

My pops (30+ years as a broker and analyst) taught me that the stock market (via active trading) is a vehicle for transferring wealth from ordinary people to financial institutions.  Big winners are EXTREME outliers and either possess a very rare investor's temperament, incredible luck, or access to enough cash to move the market in their wake.

The way I see it, if you have faith in American innovation and the overall economy, buying-and-holding a wide slice of the market is hard to beat.  It feels good, and is likely to create better returns than almost any other strategy, no matter how sophisticated.

In the event it that shit REALLY hits the fan in our corner of the world, we'll have more pressing concerns than our portfolios anyway",hXc-ufos,2,/r/stocks/comments/lsyfcs/what_caused_stocks_to_dump_yesterday_the/govcz50/,0.052,0.707,0.242,0.9943

247,DD," This is truly the problem. There are constant DD posts every few days (or hours at times) talking about the big squeeze is yet to happen and when it does your $400 stock is going to worth thousands/hundreds of thousands/millions. And people make these really loooong detailed posts about it. It's easy to follow the logic and minimize the part of your brain that says ""well... this only has like a 0.01% chance of actually happening in reality"".

When has $GME gained a significant amount of money in a day/afternoon and then continued that trend the next day? Once, back when it first went to up to around $500 at its peak. Every time the stock starts to trend up more than usually these DD posts start coming out... ""This is it guys! Here's the numbers where it shows the theoretical circumstances in which $GME takes us to the moon and crashes the market!"" I'm one of those people who buy into the hype. I've bought and sold a couple of shares of $GME more in the past two days than I'd care to admit because I get out, and then one of those posts pop up and I think ""well... it *could* happen just like they say."" But it's almost certainly not going to pop. Meanwhile hedge funds are raking in profits from rampant poor'ish people who just want to hit it big in the lottery in a scheme that they're being constantly told is ""not financial advice but the signs say it's likely going to happen tomorrow/next week/three weeks from now"".

262,GME," Also, here is another part of the problem with his post, he cites FINRA daily short volume data for GME that the float for GME is only 50 million

Here is the problem, this 1st reddit post that is using FINRA data is totally misinterpreting the data being presented.   As the FINRA page for [Daily Short Data points out](https://www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily):
> 
> Daily Short Sale Volume provides aggregated volume by security for all short sale trades executed and reported to a TRF, the ADF, or the ORF during normal market hours for public dissemination purposes (i.e., media-reported trades).  See the Daily Short Sale Volume File formatting guide.
> 
> As discussed more fully in [Information Notice 5/10/19](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019), the following key points about the Short Sale Volume may help avoid misperceptions regarding the data.
> 
> * Short Sale Volume excludes any trading activity that is not publicly disseminated. As a result, some offsetting buying activity related to reported short selling would not be reflected in the Daily Volume  and may result in the appearance of a higher concentration of short sale volume to total volume.
> * The Short Sale Volume is not consolidated with exchange data. To obtain a complete picture of the short sale volume to total volume for a particular exchange-listed stock, market participants must combine data from each of the TRFs and the ADF, as well as from each exchange.
> * Short Sale Volume does not‚Äîand is not intended to‚Äîequate to bi-monthly reported short interest position information. The short interest data reflects aggregate short positions held by market participants at a specific moment in time on two discrete days each 
> month, while the Daily Short Sale Volume reflects the aggregate volume of trades executed and reported as short sales on each trade date.

It can make you think you're doing something wrong. But this is a marathon not a sprint and I've learned from every mistake along the way. I'm so much better at this than I was when I started and I'm starting to make more trades that go up a lot. It's still small money and I still fuck it up (was 80% up on GME and 150% up on *redacted due to automod*. Took minimal profits in the end cos I got greedy) and it fucking hurts when I mess up like that. I never wanna do this shit again. And that's when I take minimal profit lol, I haven't even mentioned the ones I'm down 60% on. But it's part of the game and I force myself to learn from my mistakes and just call it paying for school lmao.

I know I'll get better over time like I already have and I'll make more from this as my portfolio grows. I try and make sure my fundamentals are good and that I trade rationally and not emotionally. I'm in my 20s but I wanna keep investing until I'm into my 30s, 40s 50s and beyond (god willing.) This ain't a get rich quick scheme, especially if you trade instead of invest.

As a newb, I appreciate anyone taking the time to share great information that is not hype, or ""you can't lose if you buy XYZ today!"", but they don't tell you they bought it a month ago for 10% of the current price. 

Your advice is great. I started with $2k a month ago and you nailed my problem perfectly. I invested 97% of it. I bought AEZS the morning it became a pump and dump, so after 1 day of trading, I was up $240, so more than 12% of my initial stake. Man, this is easy (no, I did not think it would hold). I sold with about $50 profit and it is still falling. Overall, I am about even. But I appreciate your input on scale because as some holdings fell and something else seemed better, I only had $60 to invest in something new, which was frustrating. 

I was getting frustrated and had other distractions, so I sold everything except MAC a week ago. I was annoyed by the green bounce last Friday, but they have all continued to drop this week. There is also too much talk on here about ""you can't lose until you sell."" The stuff I had would have dropped $200 this week, so making that up, I would have sought even bigger gambles. Your advice is appreciated and the only thing I would add is that sometimes selling and taking a break is not all bad.

As a newb, I appreciate anyone taking the time to share great information that is not hype, or ""you can't lose if you buy XYZ today!"", but they don't tell you they bought it a month ago for 10% of the current price. 

Your advice is great. I started with $2k a month ago and you nailed my problem perfectly. I invested 97% of it. I bought AEZS the morning it became a pump and dump, so after 1 day of trading, I was up $240, so more than 12% of my initial stake. Man, this is easy (no, I did not think it would hold). I sold with about $50 profit and it is still falling. Overall, I am about even. But I appreciate your input on scale because as some holdings fell and something else seemed better, I only had $60 to invest in something new, which was frustrating. 

I was getting frustrated and had other distractions, so I sold everything except MAC a week ago. I was annoyed by the green bounce last Friday, but they have all continued to drop this week. There is also too much talk on here about ""you can't lose until you sell."" The stuff I had would have dropped $200 this week, so making that up, I would have sought even bigger gambles. Your advice is appreciated and the only thing I would add is that sometimes selling and taking a break is not all bad. I am absolutely not an expert and my choice to cash out last week was just lucky timing. And yes, I will likely miss the bounce once we finally hit bottom.",Norse-for-the-Win,1,/r/stocks/comments/lszqy7/dont_give_up_before_you_get_good/govmcll/,0.085,0.768,0.147,0.9784

RKT too probably? And they will never drop to 0 refinances. If they drop back to 2018 like levels the company will grow (and boom) when refinance pushes happen.  Both companies have great workflow/tech advantages over their peers and could be spun off as ""fintech"" if you want to look at them that way also. No?

I like the stock.

By a lot of metrics you can consider it undervalued. I have a price target of $50 by EOY.

Corsair is projected to do just under $2b revenue next year. Its market cap is under $4b (close to $3b) - it's going to do it's market cap in revenue over the next few years. Go compare that with other companies. 

That's 2x TTM. You ain't getting many high growth companies with that kind of valuation. For reference Logitech is 4xTTM.

You are buying a company in a high growth industry - that is acquiring more companies with higher gross margin (e.g. Visuals by Impulse).

That's 2x TTM. You ain't getting many high-growth companies with that kind of valuation. For reference Logitech is 4xTTM.

We have the lock up period coming around mid-March.

Might be rocky till then - but as others have advised.

Go on a stock detox - come back in 6 months.

643,NIO," Your portfolio sounds like a bunch of stocks someone suggested to you on tik tok.

If you know how to read financial statements you could potentially be in the dark about all of those things and still make decisions based on those numbers.

&#x200B;

Do you have a foundation of market index funds?  If not, that is where I always suggest people start.  You need to understand how the stock market as a whole moves because it is usually a very powerful force influencing any individual company, like the tide influences everything in the ocean.  The market as a whole is beyond anyone's control and can be unpredictable but it is navigable and you should try to understand it if you want to invest.

&#x200B;

Then I would suggest investing in some individual companies that you know and like.  Did you buy a car recently?  Which companies products and services were good and which were bad?  Did you get a loan, open a bank account, change phone carriers?  **Which companies are making moves and which are getting left behind?  Pick the winners and ditch the losers.**

Usually pre-IPO companies have a schedule for execs ""taking money"" post-IPO. I would Bet that is why all of them sold at the same time and in similar ratios to their ""importance"". It would be 0 surprise to me that they're just taking profit after agreeing to since most of their comp is gonna be locked in equity. 

The inverse is im wrong and they see PLTR as bloated and are selling now. While I see this as less likely, it is still a possibility. I just doubt they all came together at once and said ""hey, let's pull the trigger together"". Ive worked on a lot of IPOs and never seen this. Doesnt mean its not the case.

Oraxol. I‚Äôve researched Hanmi and board of directors of ATNX. All look good. And read articles on seeking alpha about their pipelines and Oral treatment vs IV treatment. Everything looks promising but a closer look from your eyes will make it diamond. 

They also have a lot of products that may/may not change the course of chemotherapy for some type cancer cases.

884,SRPT," That is extremely helpful, thanks.

Yeah, I can see that SRPT is already a pretty ‚Äúconsolidated‚Äù biotech so a single drug wouldn‚Äôt make much waves especially if it was expected, and a small biotech with only 1 drug literally lives or dies on that drug so it will shoot up or down to oblivion. 

Until now I had been centered on PDUFA dates, so you are saying I may be better off researching phase 1-2 results for small, promising biotechs? (I love doing this kind of research as a hobby so it would be a perfectly fine thing to do for me, heh - kind of a pharma nerd :P).

887,MD," Hmm, this was a tricky but interesting one. Take into account that medical devices is a bit of a different world from drugs or biological products (although similar behaviour, of course) and I usually don‚Äôt research MD companies, but from what I gathered:

-Their 90-day Eversense product is already approved and marketed and all is well with it (it‚Äôs a great medical device for sure, having to draw blood manually each time in diabetics is always a pain), so we are only looking at the new generation 180-day Eversense and what it brings new to the table. And what it brings is - obviously - more comfort since it lasts double the time, has about the same perfomance, and presents less calibration hassles (PROMISE clinical study). So, overall, I would say I‚Äôm around 90-95% sure that the FDA will approve this new generation with no problem.

-That being said, take into account that this product is not something ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù, just an upgrade, and that the 180-day is actually already approved in Europe minus some of its calibration improvements.

-Taking all of this into account, yes, I think that when they approve the product the stock will go up a bit, but it‚Äôs not ‚Äúlife-changing‚Äù per se, so I don‚Äôt expect ridiculous gains in it. Still, I will probably buy some stock when it goes a bit lower (like it was at the end of 2019).

TLDR: yes, I‚Äôm around 90-95% confident that the new 180-day Eversense will be approved but I don‚Äôt think it would drive the stock THAT much, just a bit (although just a few dollars is quite a bit taking into account how cheap it is).

Of course, I‚Äôm only really confident with the medical/clinical part of this analysis, so take the ‚Äústock‚Äù part with a grain of salt. Cheers!",DantehSparda,1,/r/stocks/comments/lsu29k/what_makes_a_biotech_stock_go_up_or_down_more/gotiktm/,0.042,0.782,0.175,0.9934
888,ATNX," Hey! Glad you commented about ATNX, because that's one of the ones I bought this week due to the PDUFA catalyst date this weekend.

I did quite bit of extensive research about Oraxol (oral paclitaxel + encequidar), and I was quite impressed with the results. First, just so you have some context (and because I'm a pharma nerd who loves talking about this stuff :P), the idea between this combination is really smart: paclitaxel, given orally, gets quickly and efficiently ""destroyed"" by the P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a protein that we use to eliminate foreign substances (many drugs count as ""foreign"" according to our body's standards even though it's not ideal, it's just our body trying to protect us from toxic compounds), so you can't really give paclitaxel orally and have to always do it IV. 

Enter the other compound, Encequidar: this molecule does 1 thing and 1 thing only: inhibit P-gp so that paclitaxel can ""work"" in peace (so imagine as its ""protector""). This way paclitaxel CAN be administered orally and CAN work similarly to when administered by IV, because it doesn't get immediately destroyed by P-gp. But how good is it compared to IV paclitaxel? (here comes the part that you would be interested, the other is just curiosity).

Well, according to the phase III data,  the combination showed a benefit in PFS (progression free survival) and OS (overall survival) vs. the IV one, while maintaining a decent safety profile. So, overall, it significantly increased PFS and OS vs. its comparator, which are the key parameters in a cancer trial. This is also besides the fact that oral obviously has many advantages over IV regarding comfort of use, so from all of this you can guess that I'm pretty high on ATNX atm.

My confidence is around 90% that they will approve it, as it is a meaningful improvement over IV paclitaxel and the data is sound and statistically significative.

As always, I've been in this industry for quite a long time and sometimes the FDA does make unexpected decisions (so there's that 10% that I may be wrong), but in the numbers game that is investing and trading, I definitely think is statistically much more likely that OPac + Encequidar gets approved than it does not, and is worth the risk (but, as always too, this not investment advice ;) )",DantehSparda,1,/r/stocks/comments/lsu29k/what_makes_a_biotech_stock_go_up_or_down_more/govd12g/,0.036,0.846,0.118,0.9764

Also consider: Aston Martin's trading at around 2x tangible book value.  And that does make them more attractive than most companies but the auto industry has a significantly lower p/b than other industries.

970,CEO," ‚ÄúGrowth priced in‚Äù is such a tough statement to argue with when the markets are like this. With interest rates so low, people have been looking at (legit) growth stocks and pricing in 3-5 year growth simply because the Fed has given us little choice.

That being said, Spotify is simply an incredible company. They have a sticky base of users who are not willing to switch. I mean, I have 3.5k songs saved on my Spotify and as far as I‚Äôm concerned that is for life. I don‚Äôt know how I go through the effort of rebuilding that library.

Other than the stickiness, they have a ton of growth through new markets. This is a pretty simple point, but important. 

Other than new markets, they have an exceptional management team that responds, reacts, and adapts to consumer demand changes. Their podcast strategyp is solid. Not only because it will bring users to the platform, but it will drive even more paid music users. Eventually they will become the one stop shop for audio, if they aren‚Äôt pretty much already. The music industry has always been concentrated, and Spotify is now (not literally) the CEO of the Music industry. They have everyone where they want them.

Finally, I would point out that Spotify has an opportunity to take over music labels altogether. By enhancing their data and marketing for indie artists, you can get as much exposure on Spotify as you would from some marketing department at a small label. Spotify equals the playing field for small and large artists, despite the whining of some large artists who have more money than any person needs yet still complain (read: Taylor Swift) No longer we do you need daddy‚Äôs money and connections to be a musician. You just need a well recorded song and to get your song on the correct Spotify playlists (curators will allow you to pay to do so) and you can be heard.

974,BTI," I bought a bunch of BTI earlier this week. I wouldn‚Äôt say you can hold it for the next thirty years but the next ten years I think it is a good bet. Debt is coming down and they‚Äôre talking about buy-backs in 2022, they are still swallowing a nasty acquisition from a few years ago. I like that they get a lot of their revenues outside of the US. 

One option is you just buy all three big tobacco and blend them. I was confident enough in BTI to just buy it alone. Importantly, it will hold up relatively well in a crash and has a BBB+ rating. Not a value trap if your horizon is ten years.

If you‚Äôre looking for a thirty year company would get a value blue chip like Disney or Berkshire. I like Brookfield Asset Management as well and think it will do well long term. I only own three stocks and a few ETFs and believe we are sitting on a massive bubble so should tell you how strongly I‚Äôm in favor of BTI.",Maze_of_Ith7,2,/r/stocks/comments/lso8yh/british_american_tobacco_8_dividend/gotbvsa/,0.095,0.704,0.2,0.9656

977,BTI," OK, foot in mouth. It's been close to a year since I've looked at either company's financials. They're nearly identical in market cap, revenues, and profit margins. But BTI definitely has the edge on assets and equity. From a balance sheet perspective, BTI wins.

I do think MO is better set up for the future. They own 35% Juul, which is of course the number one vaping product in the US. I tend to believe vaping is a huge opportunity over the next decade, and it's one that BTI has lagged behind in. MO also has a stake in Cronos, while BTI has again dragged their feet. They've gone on record saying they like the CBD space, but I'm still waiting to see them get aggressive investing. MO also owns 10% of Anhueser Busch.

I still don't think you can go wrong either way. I've seen a lot of professionals lean slightly towards BTI, but really you're buying either for the dividend, not so much growth, and both pay a very nice one, with no issues covering it. FWIW, MO has lost $30B in market cap over the past 5 years. Not to single them out, BTI is in the same boat, but I think there's plenty of upside for both companies.

As for the loss with TEVA back in the day... It's all about timing. I'm assuming you bought somewhere around 2003-2015 when it was 20-60? It was in that range for over a decade. Percentage wise we are way below that right now, not to mention all the added inflation overtime which should increase its worth. I think it'll rally back to around $30-40 in the near future to get to at least where it was 10 yrs ago and that's without accounting for inflation which would probably hit 50 in the rally. Eventually it might hit 100 after some consolidation when hitting 50.",bestzec,-1,/r/stocks/comments/lt60iq/teva_pharma_analysis/govm8a1/,0.05,0.824,0.126,0.8873

I can stay  and watch the ad to get back to the video, or I can keep scrolling.
