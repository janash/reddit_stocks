0,PG," Yeah, I'm gonna venture a guess and say that IV went up. It pretty much just means, in your case, that there was a better time to sell this option because, with more IV it's now riskier to sell options. The stock price is expected to move more than was expected before, we just don't know which way yet. If you're wanting to buy to close, it'd cost more than you sold it for. But seeing as PG has gone up, I wouldn't sweat too much right now, worrying about that. If it expires worthless, you still keep all the credit you received. It's just how robinhood displays ""how well you're doing"" right now.",DolphinitelyJoe,16,/r/RobinHood/comments/oewqeo/why_is_my_put_credit_negative_if_the_stock_is/h49578k/,0.07,0.835,0.095,0.2617
1,RH," There could be number things:

- IV increase could raise the value of a put credit spread

- If this put credit spread has its short side too far ITM your theta ratio could be negative meaning you’ll lose money as time goes by (not what you want with a credit spread). If you’re not seeing enough delta gain from the price going up to counter the theta loss, the spread price could increase (losing you money).

-The spread could be widening. Since a spread is a composite of multiple options, if the spread of one options widens (the difference between the bid and ask) it can affect the price your broker will show you. RH shows you the mid which is a very unreliable valuation of spreads especially those with low liquidity.

I’d look deeper into the Greeks, IV, and price spread of the underlying options.

EDIT: Just noticed this may be a naked put (don’t use RH, not use the the interface). If you’re selling naked pits and can’t figure such things out yourself, re-evaluate your trade strategy. Things can go seriously wrong seriously fast selling naked puts.",PoogleyPie,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/oewqeo/why_is_my_put_credit_negative_if_the_stock_is/h49dyqv/,0.086,0.812,0.102,0.3041
2,RH," I don’t think you can tell from this screen if it was naked or not, I do a little bit of options trading on RH and I’ve never had it be naked (not allowed since I don’t have a margin account). My screen looks like this too. You can see if there is collateral tied up in the balance section that’s not shown here",OG-Pine,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/oewqeo/why_is_my_put_credit_negative_if_the_stock_is/h49l7oi/,0.0,0.959,0.041,0.3612
3,PG," This is not a $19 buy in.  He received a $14 credit for selling this out and the put is now worth $19.  But when you sell a put your max exposure is the strike price.  OP could easily be out several hundred or even a few thousand if this stock dips.  And max loss (basically impossible cuz PG won’t be going bankrupt by Friday but still) is $14,000.  This wasn’t that small a bet for the purpose to not know basics about things like volatility.",Macro19,2,/r/RobinHood/comments/oewqeo/why_is_my_put_credit_negative_if_the_stock_is/h4a5upv/,0.103,0.794,0.103,-0.25
