0,DD," What is their debt? What else is in the cap stack other than equity? 

Even so, your portion of the target is only about 15% of the equity. The SPAC at NAV is only about 340 mil ($10 \* 34.69 mil shares). So, the max that the SPAC can buy is $340 mil of value of the target. Based on your valuation, but without knowing the debt, the SPAC will own 340/2,400 = 15%. 

Unless you have better information than the agents brokering the deal, the SPAC share price is over valued. Unless new information comes out about the target that increases its valuation, then I wouldn't touch a SPAC more than 120% of its IPO price ($12 typically).

My disagreement doesn't stem from your DD, but rather more is based on how SPACs are effecting equity raises. However, I would look outside of the investor presentation for information regarding valuations and estimates.

3,GM," As a person who has done testing with them through Navistar, they still do not have much skin in the game. Sure, they teamed up with Daimler to electrify their products, and sure, they have their own bus line but there are a few factors here that most people dont know about the trucking industry and might pose a long term issue to Proterra:

1. People in the trucking industry are generally slower to change from whatever diesel, ng, and gasoline vehicles they have to electric, just because of emissions leniency in that marketplace compared to regular consumer vehicles. Because of that, the head start is not something that weighs heavy imo and the market will have plenty of opportunities to catch up. California is a big one, but the bigger projects, such as a few school bus projects,, were awarded to competitors over Proterra.  iirc. IC Bus comes to mind.
2. Bus's are also not exactly the biggest market to brag about if we are talking specifically about their ZX5/ZDi/S1LF electric bus's in comparison to the whole trucking market. Other competitors will have similar vehicles out  in the next year or so and while Proterra is already out and with sales, these OEMS will come out with vehicles that have similar eMPG's and will probably aim to be cheaper based on expected sales volume and will have the supplier support and brand recognition that Proterra does not have yet. Once these products come out, it might be an issue for Proterra (speculating here, prove me wrong tbh, would like to learn)

A perfect Example of what I mean in terms of Brand recognition and missed opportunities: IC Bus currently takes up  50% + of the market in school busses and have contracts with California already awarded for their eCharge Bus. This bus hasnt really even been released yet, but with majority of the market share, we still got the contract. I can imagine stuff like this will occur as time goes on and with market saturation in EV Bus's.

3. Who is to say that Daimler will not pull out of their partnership with Proterra? There are other battery powertrain competitors out there now that will be willing to provide drivetrains, cheaper than Proterra would in the future. Not to mention, this is Daimler we are talking about. They, just like VW have more than enough capabilities to take up their own EV architecture in the next few years (They already are) and scale up for the trucking industry.

4. For other types of trucks, vocational, heavy duty, long haul.... Hydrogen Power might be the better alternative long  term. The battery drivetrain is great until a load is given. The eMPG's do tend to drop significantly for applications where there might be a payload of atleast 15000 lbs or higher. The industry already recognizes that and is straying away from batteries for that  reason, except for Bus's if anything.

TLDR: Proterra imo, would be awesome if they had a head start and became the TSLA of trucks, but they dont and the trucking industry isnt the same as the consumer vehicle market, By the time they are out with any product outside of the Bus's that they have, they will be behind the industry leaders imo. These numbers wont mean anything knowing that Tesla, International/GM, VW, Volvo, and (yes, even) Daimler are already working on EV/ Hydrogen trucks.

The lions share of the claim of being 100%+ undervalued relies of faith in this magic 1.84 multiplier. Take that way, and they look quite evenly valued.

I've seen quite a bit of interest from the class 4 to 6 space for zero-emission options lately, and I think there is a lot of opportunity there. I get the sense that it is the class 8/long haul drivers that are hesitant at this time (and rightfully so), but i think the transition will be forced by regulation sooner rather than later. California has already passed the [ICT rule](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/fact-sheets/innovative-clean-transit-ict-regulation-fact-sheet) for transit, and one for [trucks](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/fact-sheets/advanced-clean-trucks-fact-sheet) seem to not be far behind.

On the Daimler point, I agree that they could pull out, and IIRC, they already have a battery class 8 available under the Freightliner eCascadia lineup.

89,NAV," Yeah we will never as retail get fair value, I just feel with IPOs we get screwed over more than with a SPAC. At least with a SPAC its clear to me how valuation is determined and if you buy at NAV you can pretty much always exit with minimal loss before merger.

Agree its irrational, but less than the alternative. Can you find anything fair valued on the stock market? There will be very little risk if you could (and the rewards would also be very little). People buy in the belief that a company will grow and pay the premium for it. Talking fundamentals at a $2B valuation with earnings at nearly $200m the P/E is 10, very healthy for EV. With $750m backlog and 26% margin and with $800m in cash now they can do a lot of investement without diluting. If you buy now $10 of whatever you pay per share will go directly to the company.

Bottom line if you believe Proterra will be worth this valuation and more its not irrational to invest!",mkrugaroo,12,/r/investing/comments/m0wbra/actc_proterra_dd_the_most_undervalued_stock_on/gqb0cov/,0.072,0.765,0.163,0.9539

109,BYD," According to Statista, Mexico had 56 256 passenger buses in 2019.  According to Statistics Canada, the country had about 20k transit buses in 2017 (out of 70k total).  But that 15k number is also floating around.  In any event, that adds up to greater than 70k buses, for two countries with a combined population of about 165 million. Statista also says the US had 65 000 transit buses in 2017 for about 330 million. 

We can play with definitions of what counts as a transit bus, etc.  But It's just a reality that the US massively underspends on public transport.  When comparing Canada and the US, the land of snow and ice has substantially higher transit ridership in all its major cities, beating every comparable city in the US.  And that means that outside of a handful of major metros in the US, transit fleets are small.  This makes the addressable market in the US relatively smaller for its size.  Meanwhile, something like 97% of all electric buses ever made are in China.  Shenzhen (home city of BYD) alone has something remarkable like 16 000 electric buses and 22 000 electric taxis.

Does Proterra have good tech? Absolutely.  Does that matter when bus manufacturing is also about jobs for a lot of governments? I'm not sure.  BYD built factories in Canada and the US to win contracts.  New Flyer and Lion have facilities in the US to help them win contracts there.  Is Proterra going to do the same in Asia and Europe?  

I own some Proterra and I think they have potential.  But there's a gap in perception between tech enthusiasts who see the Tesla of transit buses, and transit nerds and professionals who understand the the bus market isn't like the consumer car market.",truenorth00,1,/r/investing/comments/m0wbra/actc_proterra_dd_the_most_undervalued_stock_on/gqbsm6z/,0.022,0.867,0.111,0.9772

128,TV," Spotify has numerous hurdles to overcome for a positive future outlook. Apple music was the first huge competitor to get into the space but now Amazon has been capturing market share in the music streaming sector as well. These are both far bigger companies that can leverage their original content, devices, personal assistants, etc. The vertical integration will come so much easier to these companies that I have a hard time believing that Spotify will capture or even maintain the market share that they do have. Imagine you're watching a movie on Amazon Prime or Apple TV, a song comes on the soundtrack, you can talk to your smart device and ask what that song is, and it links you directly to your connected music account (Apple Music or Amazon Music). You can be assured that both Apple and Amazon are going to further push integration toward their own streaming services and away from Spotify over time.

That is the beast that Spotify is up against. I think they have to move the way of starting their own label or they will die. The only reason Tidal had any modicum of success is because they were able to have exclusive streaming rights to certain artists and I think Spotify needs to do the same.",LiftUni,5,/r/investing/comments/m1dxar/spotify_spot_dd_established_company_on_the_brink/gqd8yo7/,0.029,0.793,0.178,0.9841
129,DD," Great product, great market share...

There is a problem the plagues media-distribution companies that always needs to be discussed and analyzed. 

In a sense they are a middle-man between content producers and listening/viewing consumers.

The problem in this case is consumers pretty much demand total access to most popular songs and a near total library of past music.

The problem is record labels hold leverage in negotiations over content. Customers would be quick to leave and pursue other options, if content form a major record label went missing. Record labels have felt the pain from not being able to sell individual songs and albums in today's market, so they negotiate large packages of streamable material. The problem is they know how much Spotify is making.

Spotify really needs to produce more leverage over the record labels, which is why you will likely see a push into self-created content, including Podcasts. They need a way to keep customers, but lose portions of their music libraries. It would actually make sense for Spotify to be their own indie label in the long-run, but that will come with costs and that move might cause negotiation problems with current record labels that have the content they need.

If you look at Amazon, in comparison, they have the ability to run a budget service as a part of the Prime program. They can negotiate for music, including top hits, but they don't have to keep a full library or have every hit. They then negotiate for access to a limited few big-name artists. They keep customers, because the music is a part of a packaged product, but they can pool their money strategically into a more narrow set of content causing content producers to compete for access to Amazon's customers. Then Amazon goes a step further with an added pay tier, that expands the offerings.

&#x200B;

The way it use to work in the past is there were a limited number of radio stations transmitting in a market. Record labels had more pressure in negotiations to be played on the radio, in turn their music became popular and customers bought albums. That kept content cost cheaper to the radio stations.

What is different is the streaming middle-man is taking the place of both album sales and radio broadcasts, so the negotiation structure/power with the record labels is different.

Also using their app with podcasts SUUUUCCKKKS. Just go cruise /r/joerogan for the feedback on that. Podcasts are just a way to take up music time with lengthy, and therefore cheaper content.

147,AAPL," The EPS should be the dollar amount so your calculation should be:

P/E = 31.46

Dividend per share = 0.795 (from their 10K)

Dividend yield = 0.795 / 116.36 (yesterday's close) = 0.68%

Diluted EPS per share = 3.28 (from their 10K)

DPR = 0.795 / 3.28 = 24.24%

RoE = 82.09% ([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/key-statistics?p=AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/key-statistics?p=AAPL))

g = RoE \* (1-DPR) = 82.09% \* 24.24% = 19.90%

31.46 / (19.90 + 0.68) which approximately equals 1.53

193,TD," So I'm learning a lot about covered calls, and how selling them can become a good income generation stream.

I have a Roth IRA and i'm looking for reasons to NOT start selling covered calls on VYM. I've held VYM since 2012, and it is my primary holding (>80%). This means I can have multiple contracts out and because it's a Roth IRA with TD I have no stock transaction fees for buying VYM if the option gets exercised, options trading fees are my only cost but it's offset by the fact that I'm the seller.

&#x200B;

It seems like a no-downside way to generate income in such an account because if I end up being forced to sell my shares, I can just turn around and buy them again at no additional cost to me. I have >20 years left before I can even withdraw from the account anyway, so it seems like it should be something I and many other folks should be doing if they have the opportunity similar to mine to have such an account have time on their side.

194,SFIX," SFIX Cash Flow

Is SFIX Skynet efficiently telling people how to dress while printing money or is it a leach pool of inefficient logistics?

SFIX's share price fell 22% yesterday on missed guidance. I have been wading through their financials. I observed that as their users have steadily been increasing their cash has been decreasing starting in 2018.

I am interested in what Stitch Fix is spending their cash on?

Is SFIX getting less efficient as they grow or are they investing in their future? There also appears to be new debt in 2020 ($164 Million).

I like the owners 16% stake. I like >1000 brand offerings. I like the idea of Skynet telling people what to wear.

I do not like new debt.

I do not like -8.9 Million EBITDA ending the last QTR.

I do not like logistic problems.

https://ragingbull.com/kb/how-to-make-money-with-penny-stocks/

Pennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

You can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies. 

If you are using RH or WB that don't allow pennystocks there is a subreddit r/RobinHoodPennyStocks .

Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies.

Pennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

You can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early .

I'm assuming that taxable income still refers to your AGI, as with other tax situations that depend on your ""taxable income"". So it would be just your gross income, less standard deduction, less other extra deductions, to arrive at your ""taxable income"". The question, I suppose, is whether or not the capital gains would add to your gross income?

Maybe a better comparison would be Epic Games, who recently went through a funding round valued at $17.3 billion that occurred just before tech as a whole moved \~30% upwards -- important since Roblox's occurred at the top of that move.

Epic's 2019 revenues were $4.2 billion (vs Roblox's $0.5 billion). I haven't found 2020 numbers, but they generated $400 million in April 2020 alone so they would probably have seen huge growth numbers YoY similar to Roblox. Both companies have similar business models.

So if we whack \~30% off the last round's valuation for Roblox, that's still a valuation of $21 billion (and share price around $104).
