6,IMO," So far this is pretty mild as far as a selloff goes. Yesterday the Nasdaq was in the green, today it's down less than one percent.

I agree with you. Not sure exactly why the idea of rates maybe going up in over a year is so negative. It would be very surprising if they even managed to get rates up over 3% over the next 5 years. Big whoop.

IMO the scarier prospect is honestly not the idea of the rates going up a little bit and how that might affect growth companies (it really shouldn't). The real problem is, what can the FED do if they can't lower interest rates when the next economic downturn comes.",BitcoinOperatedGirl,3,/r/stocks/comments/o2o96v/dont_regret_selling_your_stocks_early/h28y014/,0.07,0.777,0.153,0.8341

37,AMD," nope, you are looking at the wrong company. Apple is still a great company to invest in however! the big hurdle is still porting programs designed on x86 to ARM, many programs do support ARM but nowhere near enough yet to *really* start hurting intel. 

Intels main revenue source is datacenter and enterprise low volume but crazy profits. datacenter is always intels and AMDs primary focus, next is client computing, this is your computer, the chip that is still in your pc and laptop unless you have an M1 based apple product. theres more volume here, less profit but still again a lot of profit to be made. most of their total revenue is from this sector. 

what market does apples M1 chip currently cater for? its highly specific, their own products, and most of which is going against what intel consideres their client computing group. now its possible the M1 chip could do datacenter tasks, it does have ECC support however there's no memory modules in LPDDR4 that support ECC making the product totally useless for enterprise until then. 

not only that i suspect apple had an exceptionally good deal with intel for their chips, its very common for intel to provide hefty bulk order discounts to system integrators because in reality, but the silicon itself is also cheap the R&D is expensive. in reality, its not just apple they should be worried about, its ARM in general. is apple with the M1 chip is accelerating the transition to ARM away from x86? absolutly, but i dont think apple will be the one to capitalise on that because they like to keep their products to themselves, but once that transition has occurred, any arm compiled program would run on any arm chip (assuming its compiled for that OS) which is the bigger cause for concern

then you have AMD, who they should actually be significantly more worried about because they directly compete with each other in the same markets, and currently, AMD is absolutely on an R&D rocket. AMD is not just staying at 10% they are not staying still for intel, Zen4 from rumours sounds like it will compete against Alder lake just fine and when the move to DDR5 for consumers seems like it will be cost-prohibitive or totally non-existant by the time Alder Lake releases, which also needs significant scheduler changes in windows to be supported due to the introduction of x86 ""big.little""

apple is still only 6% of computer sales globally. unless they start taking more of that pie, the loss to intel is honestly quite minor in relation to their size and overall profits.",ImSkripted,1,/r/stocks/comments/o2n8xt/intel_processor_market_share_may_fall_to_new_low/h293w82/,0.055,0.835,0.111,0.9809

39,AMD," imo, it feels like the semiconductor shortage is the only thing propping Intel up right now.

I've been hearing nothing but a constant stream of bad news for Intel for years about new competition, and how Intel is either years behind on their promised released dates for certain products, or getting their butts kicked by the competition when you compare their products.

Intel is one of those companies that I don't care how cheap they get, I'm simply not buying it. I've heard way too many bad things about them from my very tech savvy co-workers who much prefer AMD & ARM processors.

In the meantime AMD and TSMC aren't slowing down their node development, chip design, or advanced packaging efforts. 

Intel is relatively stronger in laptops since they can actually produce 10nm chips in volume there (I'll believe Ice Lake-S has good volume when they give real, unambiguous numbers in earnings), but I still think the only way AMD doesn't hit at least 20-25% in laptops is if they're capacity constrained from all the server and pre-built desktop share they're taking.

48,CRSR," The sectors that Corsair competes in and gets the vast majority of its revenue from are low-margin, commoditised products like memory and PSUs where everyone just rebrands Micron/Samsung/Superflower products. The only small advantage they have here is the brand, sustained by massive marketing spend. All of the acquisitions they've done are tiny and don't shift the needle on the bottom line. Elgato is probably the best business they have but that's tiny.  
Look through the financial statements going through history, and you'll notice that historic gross margins have stayed around 20%,and net income margins float around 0%.

51,BIG," Significant, SIGNIFICANT insider selling from both instutional investors and insiders. Eagle tree has tons of shares like others have noted, and I highly suspect they're the ones selling 35$ and 40$ covered calls on their shares dated throughout the year.

134,AMC," Nothing really says that shorts have to cover, other than whatever margin requirements their broker is enforcing on them. When I checked my broker earlier today there are still lots of AMC shares available to be shorted and the borrow rate is just 2%, which is actually quite low.  The opposite of ""shorts needs to cover"" that apes conveniently ignore is that longs need to sell if they want to take profits, and in the process of selling they will tank the price. This means only the people who sell first will be the ones to reap the profits, and everyone else will be left holding the bags.

In theory if everyone holds their shares and people keep buying, yes the share price can go insanely high - but in that process nobody can sell and nobody can take profits. It might make for a nice screenshot, but until you sell the stock is not cash in your hands and can't be spent on anything. In reality, people are going to sell because retail traders are not robots and everyone has their price. At the high prices only a few people can sell before the share price goes down again, so it becomes a game of chicken where 99.9% of the people holding aren't going to be able to cash in at anywhere near the peak.

137,IQ," I think all of that really positions them to succeed in their space. I do. The comment I responded to literally said they were going to have a great earnings because millionaire apes were going to buy out stores. That kind of blind fanaticism is what's so off-putting from the outside looking in. Surely you understand that.

As far as skins are concerned, steam has had zero trouble monetizing this realm so far without the influence of NFT. Before that, this market was being achieved via eBay and PayPal even though it definitely broke terms of services. So while I do see the benefit of NFT in possibly streamlining all of this, I have a hard time seeing why GameStop is going to insert themselves into the profit of this specific thing to any large degree. They're looking to solve a problem companies are already solving.

But I do understand what their execs look like these days, I do understand that they took advantage of this whole meme whirlwind to get out of debt and get into a larger cash position. While I do believe that massive windfall has absolutely nothing to do with fundamentals or high IQ business strategy, I do think it was a no brainer play that moves their timetables up immensely, and gives them options they didn't have before.

I find it highly amusing that everyone on superstonk seems to think that the ""pivot to ecommerce"" being successful is already a forgone conclusion just because they've made some management changes. If poaching market share from Amazon was as simple as firing the CEO then Amazon wouldn't be Amazon. 

Currently, Gamestop has the same market cap as many tech companies that have already shown they can be successful and have rapidly growing revenues, while Gamestop is a shrinking company.

199,KRUS," I have two. KRUS and OTGLY. Both are practically guaranteed 5 baggers in 5 years due to A) both being profitable already, B) being relatively small at this stage and C) growing incredibly fast.

KRUS (Kura Sushi) - Is simple to understand so no need for me to explain. Unit growth is fast and they are still very small. So each unit make a huge splash. They are also the market leader in their specific service specialization... though there is competition, there are literally no other major sushi chains. They are it and I would venture to say that the reason for that is sushi is very hard to do at scale. They obviously figured it out in Japan, so they are doing here. Also, prior to COVID, they were already profitable not just per store, but company wide.

OTGLY (CD Project Red) - Despite the nay sayers and emo kids who think a single bad game will derail an entire business, these guys doubled their business size the last 2 years. But, due to very long cycles, this hasnt shown up in their earnings yet. Further, their stock got hammered due to a questionable game release (as if the other companies never had one). So its a perfect storm of stock being cut by about 60%, them doubling in size, and extremely long  profit cycles. In about 2-3 years, their rev will start to consistently show double historic levels and will stay that way moving forward. Oh yea, they are also profitable so no chance of collapse.",thejumpingsheep2,0,/r/stocks/comments/o2ertd/stocks_youre_most_confident_will_5x_vugvti_in_the/h269sxy/,0.094,0.816,0.09,-0.2754

209,KW," Well, you can listen to literally every single commodities fund manager in the market today. The men and women who have all built multi billion dollar portfolios for their clients, and who have each spent decades in this exact profession. All of whom are on the nuclear wagon bandwagon, and all of whom can explain in excruciating detail exactly why solar and wind are inefficient and lackluster energies. I have not heard a single academic expert of any credibility ever posit that solar could overtake nuclear.

We can talk about how uranium, including the mining and processing, is still the most efficient energy source by KW/hr by far. We can talk about how it's the safest energy source, with less deaths than oil, solar, or wind, per KW/hr by far. We can talk about its global range, going places solar can't even begin to compete. This includes the entire northwest, from Oregon through Canada, not just Alaska. And I'm just looking at the ability to provide energy at all, and not the fact that it provides more energy, for cheaper, and safer, in every area globally, from Alaska to Arizona. 

We can talk about how nations across Europe, and even more so in China, are ditching solar to aggressively expand nuclear energy, because it's cheaper, safer, and more efficient.

 You say make a logical statement, but literally every single person who knows energy is on nuclear. Make a logical statement as to why it's a bad investment.",JDinvestments,1,/r/stocks/comments/o2ertd/stocks_youre_most_confident_will_5x_vugvti_in_the/h26ku84/,0.035,0.86,0.106,0.8593

211,USA," Ok cool so lets discount all the fund managers off the top. We all know they are doorknobs who barely keep up with an index fund on average thus are about qualified as a monkey on a dart board to talk about anything scientific. Its like asking a car salesman what they think of Teslas no dealership model... many still believe it will fail... lol.

Next, if you havent heard of a scientist telling you solar + wind can overtake nuclear its probably because you dont hang around science folks. Nor do fund managers. Well you have one now telling you that in about 10 years, wind + solar will likely reach nuclear capacity in the USA.

And thats just the USA. Worldwide, this will be done in about 5 because other countries are ahead of us (China... cough). You do realize nuclear is just like 10% of worldwide generation right? And that wind + solar is already 7% and growing by leaps and bounds... this isnt even a comparison. 5 years ago we were generating about 700TW from solar, today its about 1800TW... In the same time, nuclear went from about 6500TW to 6900TW... Im not even counting wind. If you go back 10 years, the numbers are even worse. Back then we barely had about 100TW of solar and we actually had more nuclear than we do now...

The death rates are silly. I mean, that should be obvious. Any death from solar is likely due to, sadly, working on roofs. This wont happen with giant solar farms. Can you imagine the death rate for nuclear if people did it at home?

Your efficiency numbers are outdated. Check again. Solar, when purchased wholesale rather than retail, has been cheaper than nuclear for well over 5 years and running in sunny states. It is now A LOT cheaper due to advances in panels and can be brought to parity with nuclear even in less sunny states. Now the problem is that when you include batteries, then the price climbs above nuclear but for how long?

Panels keep becoming more efficient and cheaper every year by about 2% and batteries are in their infancy... i mean 5 years ago it would cost well over $1/Wh for battery storage, and next year Ford is releasing a F150 with likely well over 100kWh for about $40k... 2021 Teslas model 3 is about 82kWh for $40k. The prices are in free fall and the tech is no where near done in terms of improvement. We probably have another 10 years for panel innovation before plateau assuming absolutely no new breakthroughs and another 20-30 years for batteries. In 10 years, solar + batteries will be so cheap that they would even make sense in low sun areas.

Further, you need to account for current cost of nuclear plants... this is something people dont consider. Nuclear plant cost is not what it used to be and many calculations used today are based on those old costs. Its possible that old plants might be cheaper than solar/wind (not always) but you cannot, in any way, build a new one that will be cheaper today. Why do you think utilities arent rushing out to build them even in low regulation states? Yet they are all building solar/wind farms and battery banks in droves...

I have no idea where you got that China and Euro info about them ditching solar for nuclear. Please give a citation. Hell just today there was a report of damaged fuel rods in China lol. Further China already generates twice as much from solar/wind than they do nuclear. Between 2019 and 2020, China installed 30% more solar/wind while increasing nuclear 2.4%...",thejumpingsheep2,10,/r/stocks/comments/o2ertd/stocks_youre_most_confident_will_5x_vugvti_in_the/h26p0ti/,0.06,0.862,0.079,0.7468

383,COO," Because it's not legal.

&#x200B;

In order for something to be considered insider trading, it has to pass two tests: is the information PUBLIC and is the information MATERIAL?

&#x200B;

PUBLIC means that anyone has access to the information. That doesn't mean it has to be published anywhere, for example you might notice that your favorite store is empty all the time. After calling around to your friends in different cities, they confirm. That would be considered public information, since anyone could do what you did. But if a newspaper has info that the rest of the world doesn't have, then it is not public - until they publish it.

&#x200B;

MATERIAL means: will the information affect the price of the stock once it is released? If the CFO has a sister who is about to come out of the closet, that is not material information. But if the COO is in the hospital with COVID, that is definitely material, and it would be illegal for doctors, nurses, etc in the know to trade or pass on that information.

&#x200B;

Furthermore, if someone is in possession of material, non-public information and they pass it on to someone else who then trades on it, *both* parties are guilty.

5 Year on AAPL is 464%”

I don’t quite understand the thought of “it’s hard to add to a already large market cap”. 

They have virtually unlimited money for R&D. So while you might look at it as “it’s hard to add 500B to a 2T market cap” I look at it as “a company with a 2T market cap and a long history of innovation in technology has an infinite amount of money to continue to make products that will likely become a part of people’s everyday life”

They (using AAPL in this case - but you can use any tech stock you’d like) are constantly making products that are universally loved and consumed at crazy high rates.

Over the last twenty years: iPod. iPhone. iPod Touch. MacBook Pro. iPad. More iterations of iPhones that has users buying a new one every two years. Apple Watch. Bought BEATS by Dre and blew that up. Apple Pay. MacBook Air. AirPods.

And that’s off the top of my head. Look around when you’re out and about - I’m guessing almost every person you see has or uses an Apple product. Most of them you can see out in the open - watch, AirPod, phone.

Obviously I’m long in AAPL - but my reply can really be used by any mega-cap tech stock (insert their cutting edge products instead).",Washedup11,3,/r/stocks/comments/o2axao/thinking_of_selling_apple_to_put_it_into_index/h261zns/,0.034,0.93,0.037,0.5848

424,AAPL," You bought a put originally. From there, you had three options: sell the put, exercise the put, and let it expire. If you sell the put, you sell it to someone else who will either have the same 3 options til eventually at expiry, there's no more selling, only exercising or letting expire. If you exercise the put, it means you are allowed to ""put"" your share into the put sellers account at the strike price agreed. So if you bought AAPL puts with 120 strike and the stock falls to $110, you have the right to buy at 110 and immediately exercise by putting them to someone else at $120. It's only useful to exercise when your option, in this case a put, is in the money. But if you are before expiry date, usually selling the option itself is the best option, i.e., it will give you more profit. So you did the correct thing in this case.
