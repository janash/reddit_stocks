0,NC, They just need to make burgers and sandwiches in between those donuts (less the glaze of course)and the money will fall from heaven! I had to purchase some shares only because KK is one of my favorite toddler memories. No other reason than I love KK. On days when mom needed the car she would  take my dad to work and wed stop at KK for a donut around the corner from his office. I will never forget pointing to the exact donut I wanted off the belt and she loved it when we came in and they'd always meet me at the stool and lift me over the counter so I could show them just the right donut I wanted.   I was 3 and we only had one car and it was the best to get to stop there.  I'm from NC and KK is one of my first stops when I'm home to visit...and the same location is still there....KK has to survive lol.,Inittowinit6446,3,/r/stocks/comments/obxqrc/do_not_fall_for_krispy_kremes_ipo_trap_a_legacy/h3rby73/,0.044,0.751,0.205,0.9852

26,VERY," Unfortunately no. As soon as a bogus “YOLO”, “all in”, etc screenshot gets called on being fake, the whole thread gets nuked within minutes and the person who proved it gets banned. The user/bot that posted it is continued to be allowed to push the meme stocks. 

One guy ran one through an online JPEG forensic tool that shows what parts of a JPEG YOLO someone posted had been edited. I refreshed the thread a few seconds later and he was already nuked. 

The mods are obviously either facilitating this or are directly behind it. WSB is now basically the most sophisticated bot farm on Reddit. Maybe even the entire internet.

137,CIO," Prior to 2020, the fundamentals looked pretty good. Revenue increased about 60% (767 million 2018, 1.23 billion in 2019) with expenses only increasing by about 19.6%. They had a weird expense (unlisted on TD) that resulted in a net loss, but it looks like it’s unusual or infrequent for 2018.

I’d need to do some further research as to the exact reason why they took such a big hit in 2020 that resulted in a negative revenue stream (rather than just blaming it on covid, but instead looking at exactly why). 

EDIT: looks like they took a HUGE hit on selling their investment securities, $1.03 billion loss around the March 2020 time period. It seems to me that these losses have nothing to do with the actual operations of the business itself, but rather the other/non-operating income/loss. They did just hire a new CIO, which I think is an incredibly smart play by them (considering the dumb decision of the prior CIO to sell securities at a $1.03 billion loss—especially considering the current state of the economy). If they would’ve held onto those assets until now, we’d probably see a HUGE increase in their FV in the asset side of the balance sheet as well as a HUGE spike in non-operating income.

For Q1 2021, they had $326,182 in revenue. This is better than both 2018 and 2019 Q1 results, so it looks like they’re off to a strong start for 2021.

My only concern as of now is what the Fed decides to do with interest rates. I predict that if they decide to raise them, the firm will have to cut back on their acquisition of properties and will have higher operating costs as the cost of mortgages will increase with the interest rates.

I’m hoping that they can return to pre-covid levels and I will be interested to see their Q2 reports. This is a long term play for me (100% ROI looks enticing to me).",suppresser2774,2,/r/stocks/comments/ocd4fy/what_would_be_some_goodcheap_dividend_stocks/h3udqsy/,0.067,0.724,0.209,0.995

270,DD," Jesus, do some actual DD before dumping money into something. There's a lot to bullish on with regards to SoFi, reading their prospectus would shed some of the pros and cons on the company for you. To start they have a very good CEO in Noto and good management. They have strong growth QoQ and YoY and will be profitable this year. Their customer base is growing substantially. They have preliminary approval for a bank charter and have acquired a bank, they are expecting the charter to be completed by the end of the year, this will reduce their costs and increase revenues substantially. They are the ONLY one stop shop for loans, investing, banking, etc. They also own Galileo which is the same as Square/Paypal so they can do C2C and B2B transactions, A LOT of people don't realize that. 

&#x200B;

Bearish cases are thin, short term volatility is going to be immense as lockup expiry results in a huge release of shares (total shares are over 800Million!), there will be a big increase in the float over the coming weeks. Bigger investors/tutes know that the price was going to come down with the massive amount of shares being released from lockup, they are probably/hopefully just waiting on the sidelines for a better entry point. They are also entering an increasingly crowded sector with established banks and rising fintechs all over the field, it's a huge pie, but a lot more mouths to feed. There's also the chance the bank charter could not be approved.

307,ABNB," My take on valuation solely consists of the old Peter Lynch quote, “Investing in stocks is an art, not a science, and people who’ve been trained to rigidly quantify everything are at a disadvantage.” Another historical example was Massachusetts banning their residents from buying the Apple ipo because it was priced at 90x earnings and they thought the valuation would offer investors poor returns. The rules are constantly changing.

In my mind, it’s always been far more important to maintain cash flow into my portfolio and invest in super high quality management in expanding markets that should compound quite well for decades. If I believe NET is a 500b company in 15-20 years, there’s little reason to fuss about valuation, especially when it’s such an imprecise art. I understand it being more difficult getting in now, as my cost basis is significantly lower in most of the companies you mentioned (low 40’s in NET for example) but you really just need to commit to it.

I also found it interesting that during the huge growth sell off, stocks like NET and CRWD didn’t pull back as hard as a PTON ROKU or TDOC (all 5 of which I own) and they immediately made new highs, saw huge institutional accumulation, and saw some crazy volume. People want to own these stocks, and valuation can’t reflect the qualitative.

AMZN has traded at > 50 P/E since 2005, and usually much higher than that. if you plan to hold for a long time, it doesnt matter too much what price you buy at if its a growing company. this is especially true in non-cyclical sectors w/ high growth stocks. they're more forgiving than stuff like CLF where you have to have decent timing because the stock will move like a sine wave  
  
i dont think diversification is necessarily a bad thing so long as you know what your stocks do & have a good thesis for owning it. i own 40+ stocks, but i am quite aggressive and tend to buy smaller, high growth companies. so if one is a dud, I dont want it to blow a hole in my portfolio

325,CRM," I agree with what you said! Regardless of valuation, good companies in expanding sectors will move up over time. I guess I’m a little worried that jumping in at a rich valuation would result in a lower than average market return - or rather the opportunity cost of not getting on the ground floor of a multibagger(even though it’s a crapshoot)

I also believe that value isn’t dead, of course finding good companies with good business models and management is important, but you can also try to get the best price that you think you can get. I don’t mean wait and hold cash for years hoping it drops to a certain price point, but to look for the best opportunities that you believe in is the future and providing you the best possible returns as well. 

There’s just so many companies with great tailwinds for the future, it’s pretty much impossible for me to invest in all of them! So I’m picking a few that I believe with give me the most bang for my buck (I think anyways)

On the topic of Etsy, I like the two acquisitions that they made but last quarter they also said about 30% of their revenue from sales was from masks. I wanted to get in when it sat at 160 but I didn’t feel strongly enough before it jumped. I’d like to see a few more consistent quarters to get enough conviction to invest in them. 

Same thing with PINS, they got a huge bump from COVID but I’m sort of skeptical of how much they can grow, since I believe that it’s a more niche social media platform than say a Facebook. Again I’d like to observe a bit more and see what direction they’re headed before I jump in.

386,CD," Confusing ambiguous statements are not any better. I know there's a grey area in what you are saying, however, there's no status indicator, or loading sign (%). No respect for the end users' time. Every user wants some expectation of a time frame. Even the technicians that have to work on these machines don't know when to tell the end user it's ready, especially if they're hovering over your shoulder while you fix it. 

Microsoft has done a lot better since version 1511, 1610, 1709, 1804, 1903, 2004, etc...builds but still question the efficiency and transparency. Every time they come out with a new build, and it's a lot for Windows 10, I end up having to reimage a lot of machines fresh to get a better user experience. I used to do this on Major upgrades i.e. 7 to 10 or 8.1 to 10 because Microsoft is notorious for being terrible with upgrades. Also they force driver updates, display driver updates, firmware updates, and they seriously screw up the machines (this is more prevalent for end users, and poorly administered IT environments, but still a huge source of headache at least for the current organization I work in with Azure/Intune). We seem to have better control of driver/updates from our legacy SCCM setup. We are running both currently. 

Now it seems every major build is so significant it can leave behind a lot of residual space, and/or run worse than a clean install. Often times the new UI breaks, and menu/search index features are broken, have to do an OS clean up like sfc /scannow or a DISM cleanup I have to go into the original control panel (which you can still find from Windows 7 days). I still use the control panel in Windows 10 because of this. Do you think they will ever fully get rid of the blessed ""Control Panel?"" Maybe Windows 11 will once and for all transition away to something new entirely that doesn't break its UI. I think they will have to make a fundamental change

All I can do is relay the same stupid message to them with a smile ""Don't worry it's setting everything up for you."" Jesus. LOL. Chromebooks don't do this, and neither does Mac OS (uses Apple logo with loading bar at least) or Linux (which gives you all the verbosity you can ask for). Chromebooks are wildly successful in schools districts because of their no nonsense easy to use simplicity. But it's almost too simple and under-powered, and very limiting for power users or software compatibility.

My point...At least I could translate some of the verbosity if the end user were there, but it leaves the technician and the end user in the dark. Forced updates make this all even more terrible and tell the user ""Do not turn off your PC"" even though you can, and because that person might have an important deadline for work to tend to, and could care less about their windows being up to date.

How is that any more comforting, please enlighten me. 

My point, regardless if bootable was or was not supported, it'll be the last of it, because they can no longer design an OS within those constraints to fit on something like Hiren's Boot CD or a 32GB SSD (because flash storage is expensive). Ah, the good 'ol days. Call my rants naive all you want. Bootable environment are a technicians wheelhouse, and are useful for fixing all sorts of boot issues and doing emergency backups.

Aside from any boot-able options that Microsoft doesn't support, their OS takes up more space than ever before, and failed botched windows updates end up in the ever-so-bloated WINSXS folder. Forcing people to go out and upgrade to bigger and bigger hard drives, scared to turn off the PC or fix it.

These are basic machines used for basic web browsing. They weren't for staff, they were for students who needed web access. These students will probably grow up their entire lives not knowing a damn about what Linux is, indoctrinated into a Windows 10 culture of these messages, thinking this is how we do it. Ha ha..don't turn off your PC, kids! :/

I worked for a court justice center that had kiosk machines running on Linux, nobody would be the wiser.

My point is that those are paperweights now, and the OS is inefficient.

If there are plenty of reasons to hate windows, let's talk about Windows updates, because you definitely steered clear of that one.

All I can do is relay the same stupid message to them with a smile ""Don't worry it's setting everything up for you."" Jesus. LOL. Chromebooks don't do this, and neither does Mac OS (uses Apple logo with loading bar at least) or Linux (which gives you all the verbosity you can ask for). Chromebooks are wildly successful in schools districts because of their no nonsense easy to use simplicity. But it's almost too simple and under-powered, and very limiting for power users or software compatibility.

My point...At least I could translate some of the verbosity if the end user were there, but it leaves the technician and the end user in the dark. Forced updates make this all even more terrible and tell the user ""Do not turn off your PC"" even though you can, and because that person might have an important deadline for work to tend to, and could care less about their windows being up to date.

How is that any more comforting, please enlighten me. 

My point, regardless if bootable was or was not supported, it'll be the last of it, because they can no longer design an OS within those constraints to fit on something like Hiren's Boot CD or a 32GB SSD (because flash storage is expensive). Ah, the good 'ol days. Call my rants naive all you want. Bootable environment are a technicians wheelhouse, and are useful for fixing all sorts of boot issues and doing emergency backups.

Aside from any boot-able options that Microsoft doesn't support, their OS takes up more space than ever before, and failed botched windows updates end up in the ever-so-bloated WINSXS folder. Forcing people to go out and upgrade to bigger and bigger hard drives, scared to turn off the PC or fix it.

These are basic machines used for basic web browsing. They weren't for staff, they were for students who needed web access. These students will probably grow up their entire lives not knowing a damn about what Linux is, indoctrinated into a Windows 10 culture of these messages, thinking this is how we do it. Ha ha..don't turn off your PC, kids! :/

I worked for a court justice center that had kiosk machines running on Linux, nobody would be the wiser.

My point is that those are paperweights now, and the OS is inefficient.

If there are plenty of reasons to hate windows, let's talk about Windows updates, because you definitely steered clear of that one.

Their mistake was not going public when more people started using their app. I don't think RobinHood is evil, but I do think they're going to need a change of executives before they can fix their public image. Greed got the best of them and it but them hard. This being said, i don't recommend the stock until it dips even though I'm not a financial advisor.",Kind_Committee8997,1,/r/stocks/comments/ocgh3b/is_robinhood_really_a_good_guy/h3u93yp/,0.133,0.806,0.061,-0.6953
