1,BBN," Also worth knowing is that income from such securities is often federally tax exempt and under certain circumstances also state exempt. This can effectively double the return profile post-tax for high income earners. They vary in method of repayment (general state obligation, special tax levy, etc.), location, and credit quality, which has been solid over a long period. You can get exposure buying individual bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, and closed-end funds, my favorite. One reason is such funds often trade at a discount which boosts the tax-advantaged income. Another is leverage, also emphasizing the tax-advantaged income. MUC, for example, borrows about 40% against the portfolio at super cheap rates to buy more securities. It increases returns and adds volatility. From the end of 2019 to the low of the pandemic, MUC dropped from $14 to $10.76, or about 23%. That’s much better than equities but didn’t increase like US bonds at that same time. Now MUC has rebounded and outperformed while TLT is back to its pre-pandemic price. Anyway, you could make an argument individuals could sub munis for their bond allocation and pick up some yield at not much extra risk. The total muni market isn’t huge like government treasuries, so mostly bigger investors can’t make large allocations, so the littler investors have an opportunity. BBN is a nice fund of taxable muni bonds which at times over the years has yielded 6%+ and been a nice little compounder.",Empirical_Spirit,6,/r/investing/comments/nikmbr/whats_the_disadvantage_if_any_in_using_a_fund/gz32osd/,0.018,0.789,0.193,0.9889

3,TX," Great summary. Also if you live in a no tax state or low tax state you can use any states fund or a multi state fund.

However if you live in TX I see no reason to use a NJ fund over a multi state fund with better diversification.",genesis311,3,/r/investing/comments/nikmbr/whats_the_disadvantage_if_any_in_using_a_fund/gz2m0ia/,0.119,0.694,0.187,0.694
4,DD," Hey one thing you may consider.  Why not just put the money into a unit trust.  As an example PBT pays about 6% based on their last monthly dividend (about 2.1 cents per share) and share price (about $4.20 per share).  If the price of oil goes up (or even stays higher) then the units (shares) will probably go up in value, and as a bonus you can even get some tax advantages on selling the shares (but not the dividends) by 1031'ing into another unit trust or similar investment.  This is kinda complicated to explain but just realize you can defer taxes on gains in the share/ unit price by buying a similar investment and carefully following the rules.

As an added bonus for this particular stock/ trust, they just switched operators about 9 months ago (from Conoco to a group called Blackbeard) and the new operator has really picked up the drilling which has caused the oil pumped and thus sales (and stock price) to go up, but it looks like it may keep going up for at least another year (or it may not).

Do your own DD but there was another guy pumping this stock on reddit so you can look for his DD if you are interested. However be a bit warned. He was talking about the stock/ unit cost going up 400-500% and I just don't think that's going to happen, but it still should go up and even if it doesn't there is that 6% yield which will also probably go up.

FYI, I don't own this one but I'm thinking about buying it, I just feel like I can do better elsewhere, for now, but if fixed income (actually variable income in this case) is your thing....",KSInvestor,1,/r/investing/comments/nikmbr/whats_the_disadvantage_if_any_in_using_a_fund/gz3he2s/,0.017,0.843,0.14,0.9882

I received a 10k scholarship for school (dental)

I have no income, and am a first year dental student 

My main objective is to make money passively while in school

No need for the money “immediately”

What would be my options for super high risk and super low risk 

I have about 1.5k in Schwab ETFs

70k from undergraduate & graduate school loans + the 300k dental school loans that will be accrued over the next four years

15,ABC," You are right basically for a year you add up all your gains and losses and you get taxed on the gains-losses. One thing to watch out for is wash sales that may carry over a year and push a potential loss to the next year, so you end up having a big gain with no loss to offset it.

Meaning lets say I buy two call options

Call ABC makes me a profit of 100k

Call XYZ I make a loss of 100K and this call expires on Dec 20th 2020.

At the end of the year I think I am good as I have 100k gains -100k losses so I shouldn't have any extra taxes

However I then buy another call for XYZ on Jan 2nd, now thats a wash sale and now my 100k loss cannot be claimed in 2020 it goes to 2021 meaning now I just have a 100k gain in 2020.",SirGlass,2,/r/investing/comments/niegju/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gz31ce3/,0.104,0.789,0.107,0.3818
16,NAV," You've misunderstood. Target date mutual funds are not like ETFs in that they are not traded on a secondary market at all. But they are like ETFs in that both are open ended and when you sell shares of it (and new buyers aren't buying) they are redeemed for their holdings. When you sell a share of SPY, someone buys your share of SPY to hold or someone buys it to redeem for shares of 500 individual stocks which they can sell.  

What you are thinking of are closed end funds (CEFs). Those cannot be redeemed easily so they can trade at a significant premium or discount to NAV. If you're selling a bunch and no one wants to buy, the price could fall, disconnected to the underlying holdings.",kiwimancy,2,/r/investing/comments/niegju/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gz3cz46/,0.079,0.787,0.134,0.8412
17,DVD," Having experienced first hand how shitty their management was and how they couldn’t adapt to the slightest changes (like moving from DVD to blu-ray) I personally might be biased and jaded here.

But also from your side of the argument...how is that going to turn into money and an increased share price?",TheSqueezeHasSquozen,2,/r/investing/comments/nice2u/redbox_to_go_public_later_this_year_via_special/gz15qqd/,0.097,0.773,0.13,0.4404
18,DVD," No you can’t. Imagine getting yelled at for 20 minutes straight on every call because someone’s $1.50 DVD rental was supposedly scratched and they now supposedly can’t feed their kids because they are short $1.50. And this person has called 30 times in the same month (they’re milking the system) they call you a homophobic or racist slur because you can’t help them. It’s against company policy to hang up the call even though it’s now a human rights violation. Your manager doesn’t care and won’t take the call.

If you give them a credit you’re breaking company policy and risking termination. If you hang up you’re risking termination. If you speak your mind and tell them to shut up you’re fired on the spot and walked out by security.

So you have to sit there on the call and take it.

You aren’t allowed to go to the bathroom without approval.

You don’t get time between calls. You have a headset on. The next call automatically comes in the instant this call ends. If you push a button to take yourself out of the queue in between calls they hold it against you.

You are then also reprimanded for the same call because “It went over your target handle time.”

They never give raises and then rub company revenue in your face. They don’t give sick pay so you can’t afford mental health days.

And they pay minimum wage.

Edit: I may be biased and it could still be a good investment but I won’t support a company that does that to anyone.",TheSqueezeHasSquozen,3,/r/investing/comments/nice2u/redbox_to_go_public_later_this_year_via_special/gz187dc/,0.073,0.874,0.053,-0.3131
19,OR, If you are maxing out your 401k and tour Roth IRA you should not worry about a stock position worth $3k. When you say RSU I am assuming you are an employee for the company? Restricted Stock Units are meant for employees of the company I believe. Your 401k will essentially have to be indexed already so you don’t have the option of using individual stocks in most of your portfolio. My advice is to keep the individual stock OR buy another individual stock since most of your portfolio will be forced to be ETFS and Mutual Funds. Taking a slightly more concentrated position on a small percentage of your funds is perfectly fine.
