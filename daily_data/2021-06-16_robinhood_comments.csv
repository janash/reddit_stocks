0,RH," That is not a RH rule, that is a rule that all brokerage firms have to go by.  When you sell a security, it takes 2 days for the funds to settle.  During those 2 days, the money that you received for selling the security doesn't actually settle and come back to you for 2 days. During this period, the brokerage firm has to essentially 'loan' you the money so that you can trade, assuming you don't have any more cash in your account. So, if you bought and sold 25k worth of securities today, then you wouldn't actually receive the money from those sales for 2 days, bc the settlement period has not closed out and cleared the transaction. I'm not sure why they picked 25k to be the magic number for allowing people to day trade, but I am assuming that it's a 'risk factor' for the firms so that if you do have a bunch of buys/sells and you don't end up having the money to settle up, then they could at least get the $25k from you if they had to.",Critical-Gazelle3832,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/o162dk/day_trade_question_confused_please_explain/h200qb8/,0.023,0.928,0.049,0.1702
