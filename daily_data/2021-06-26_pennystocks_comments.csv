I sold a few things at a loss to free up some cash for meme stocks a month ago and it worked out well. But I’m in and out in a day, I don’t even hold overnight. If I’m down 8-10%, I get out. When I’m up 20-30%, depending on the movement, I get out as well.

22,ATOS," ATOS is solid, I don’t know why people are crumbling when after hours has such low volume which means the price can easily be pushed down.

We have many more catalysts such as OPEX week, for those who don’t know, Option expiry week, there is huge open interest in the calls which mean market makers will have to buy up millions of shares to remain delta neutral, this can cause the price to rise and if it rises enough it could spark a gamma squeeze which will rocket the price.

I expect $10 at some point soon, paper hands could drop it on Monday as they expected a large candle on Friday, nothing is certain in stocks and people should know that, the fundamentals for this stock are solid and it is easily worth more than its current value.

Opex week should be interesting so I’d advise not selling anything until at least after then.
