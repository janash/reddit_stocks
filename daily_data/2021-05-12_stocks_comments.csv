0,BB," You have my upvote; agreed. Can we also retire the incredibly boring and repetitive comments on this sub, such as:

1. ""Time in the market beats timing the market."" (Yes, but why are you also then saying that you bought the dip? Aren't you both aiming for time in the market and timing the market?)
2. ""Everyone is a genius in a bull market.""And ""Bears have predicted 12 million of the last 2 crashes.""
3. ""What red? I don't know what YOU \[implied ignoramus\] bought that you're in the red?! I'm doing splendidly with my oil/cigars/lumber stocks that I have never mentioned before in my life on this reddit.""Btw, I started putting money into Roth this year, and even my INDEX fund was red today, so don't mock people for saying they have losses because they invested in tech or clean energy at a peak unknowingly. I remember when people were asking in January or February - ""is it good time to buy now when the market is so high?"" And the answer was always the aforementioned ""Time in the market beats..."" Now the same investors are being mocked for buying ""the peak"" - as if any of us had known what was going to happen.

3,TSLA," It isn't necessarily always confirmation bias. This sub isn't a singular voice and there are often conflicting voices on the same day and in the comments of the same posts.

 CNBC is a singular voice with hosts that are each individually responsible for their own opinions and the content they air.

This sub is literally over 2 million people.... many with different various opinions and many that argue with each other.

The ""no one ever knows"" narrative is a mix of truth and BS.  If I could predict exactly the dates and times the market would behave one way, I'd be far richer than I am... yes. However, there are an array of variables that do give indicators to be concerned with and react to. We can't pretend like we don't have the ability to research the world and note trends just because we can't predict the exact day, week, month, or even year the party ends.

The problem is we all have opinions to voice that and aren't so white and black, but are we suppose to never voice those opinions?  

For example, one layer of information is the average P/E ratio of the market has been escalating very rapidly this year and it was easy to see parts of the market that investors were placing much money into. No, I can't magically know precisely what happens when, but yes I can reliably say... yes I knew that was too high for the market to stay at for a long time and what parts of the market are causing it? .... I'm still concerned about that metric actually.

On the flipside those of us that told people that parts of the market were riskier than people were making them out to be in advanced, ignored some of us when we mentioned. Yet, if I say the same thing after there is a little bit of red it is characterized as boastful and annoying. The opinion never really changed. 

It wasn't long ago many people were arguing with me to double down on TSLA at $850, that wasn't confirmation bias. It was many people with different opinions often debating each other in the comments of a few dozen similar threads.

Just because the world isn't so literal white and black and we can't predict exact numbers, exact dates, etc... doesn't mean we don't have an ability to observe the world at all. It also doesn't mean we are always right either, but just because someone or something isn't always right it doesn't mean there aren't real observations with predictive value across many instances.

The problem is you're confusing the ability to research the world with some amount of predictive value with being a white and black soothsayer that knows specifics prices and dates. The world is more grey, you can have observations of predictive value over time and will be ahead on average and not nessecarily know what the market closes at tomorrow..

&#x200B;

As for me I like reading other people's thoughts on stocks. I like varied opinions and a bit of conflict. If I buy something, I want to put it through wringer first. I want to know all the bad stuff and dirty laundry on that company and their current strategy and market position.

Airlines have often flown through bankruptcy successfully—American, Delta, and United have all done it—and airlines that each has merged with have done it as well, in some cases more than once, without jeopardizing airline operation or safety.

Social media a toxic brew of cult-like echo chambers and pump-and-dumps. This is an awful place for financial advice. You have no idea how qualified some one is or what their agenda is. I find it really time consuming to sort through the garbage of reddit to find anything of value here. Your time is probably best spent perusing financial statements  and 10ks of companies you're interested in.

119,DCF," It looks like I've written an essay here. Things got a little out of hand. WTF am I doing.

First off, If you prefer, ETFs are much, much easier to invest with. In addition to be easier, there is a lot of data that indicates ETFs are better because many people/funds don't beat ETFs over the long term.

I do the following stuff because I like/enjoy investing (I don't know why). Its become a hobby for me that I am becoming more and more serious about as time goes on.

There are different ways to price a stock. First, You find the information you need in the financial statements. Sadly, you'll be learning a bit of accounting at this point.

I also want to add that learning to read financial statements is really important. To start learning about the statements, I suggest you find an income statement. The top line is revenue. Look at this number and then move down and look at the gross profit/loss. A good company will have a gross profit here. Then move down further and find the Net income. This is the final profit. Hopefully they have profit. If they don't, find out why.

The ""simplest"" valuation metric is share price divided by earnings. Earnings is profit/net income (P/E). It is easy and readily available to calculate/find. The historic average is around 15ish. the S&P average right now is around 22 I believe. This is almost historically high. ie: stocks are ""expensive"". At P/E of 15, it takes 15 years to pay off your initial investment. If you find a growing company, this payoff can be much sooner. This is why you want companies that are growing. The big thing with growth, is that you don't want to pay ""too much""(what ever that means, its subjective). For example, Tesla is about P/E of 500. This ""high"". In the long term, the P/E will eventually revert to the mean. Profit and share price are what affect the P/E so, for it to revert to the mean, they can make more money, or the share price can drop, or a combination of the two. That's why growth is sort of a gamble. For tesla, you are paying a big premium in the hopes that they are going to be massively profitable. If they miss on their profits a little bit, the share price will probably start coming down.

When a company has no profit, you can't calculate a P/E.

In that case, you can look at cash flow. Companies historically trade at 15 times their cash flow. Super easy way to calculate is to find operating cash flow, add back capital expenditures and divide by the market cap. If its higher than 15, its ""expensive"". However if the company is growing, it can be worth it to ""overpay"". Your willingness to overpay should depend on your belief/understanding of the businesses ability to ""grow into its share price.""

You can look at share price to revenue/sales. If its software, you might compare your company you like to something like Microsoft or oracle. If your company trades much higher than the industry, it is ""expensive"" and you are paying a premium. If you pay a premium, You hope that your company grows into the price your paying. Something like Palantir is at 30 times revenue while oracle is 5 and Microsoft is around 10 or so I think. With Palantir, they would have to double their cash flow to get this ratio down to 15, which is still higher than other software companies. Once again, if you pay more, this means you think that Palantir will ""grow into its current share price"".

If you want to get more complicated, you can go full-business-school and build complicated models in excel called ""discounted cash flow analysis"" or DCF. These are time consuming and have a lot of inputs. I find them troublesome because you are basically are making educated guesses about any number of the inputs. Bad judgements or errors can really affect the outcome of a DCF model. This is the sort of thing the investment banks doing(among many other strategies). There are simpler models you can build too.

If someone is talking to you about ""fundamentals"" but they are NOT discussing something similar to what I've written, stay the fuck away from them. Its not fundamentals.

If someone says I expect the share price of tesla to be 1500 dollars in three years, your next question should be ""what P/E"". Someone told me that they thought tesla would be 1500 with a P/E of 80 2 years from now). I found their current P/E and earnings on yahoo and then, I spent 5 minutes and calculated that they thought earnings/profit would be 20x higher 2 years from now. Maybe, I don't know. Sounds optimistic to me, but I don't know.

Wow I wrote an essay here. Anyways, I hope this sort of steers you in a good direction. I'm no expert, but I hate to see people losing their money because of other peoples bad advice.

I am not affiliated with any of the following and I have no agenda here:

If your interested, there's a CFA on YouTube with a small channel called Cameron steward, CFA. He might be confusing at first, but he wants to teach and analyze companies. His method is one way to do it. Great way to learn the above stuff. If you went through a handful of his videos you'd basically have a handle on the above stuff.

Another channel is called Everything Money. They break stock down a little more simply, but they're good. Their approach is respectable. The downside is that they are shilling their software pretty hard, but I think its actually decent stuff.

Another channel that I respect is Sven Carlin. He's a PhD in risk management.

A good book to read is ""One up on Wall Street"" by peter lynch. He wants to teach this stuff too, but its a book. Its not a hard read though. He wrote it in 1989 which seems old but its funny how much things have stayed the same even though the industries are different. A surprisingly high number of the ""can't miss"" stocks from that era are gone or struggling now. Makes me wonder about all the ""sure things"" I see now.

Investopedia is a good resource to learn about investing concepts. When I come across something I don't understand, I go there.

If your still with me, best of luck.

125,MSFT," > How do you know it will drop 10-15%? What if it only dips 5% at a time from now on and you never buy in because you are waiting for it to dip 10-15%

Not him but there's an easy answer to that: the price. Absolute values make talking of relative percentages much easier to grasp. 

Simple example: consider MSFT.

- went between 230 and 240 a bunch in march

- grew to 262 in anticipation of earnings in april

- 4-5 days before actual earnings it started to dip and kept slightly below 260

- after earnings started to dip gradually to 250

- now went to 238

To go back to the questions asked: there was a lot of ""dipping and growth"" during these two months. Some of it relatively predictable, some less so. Obviously the values didn't go too crazy and there was ""only"" 13% gain if you bought the lowest value and sold the highest, but that's about it. Even if you took your sweet time you had a full month to get in and positive earnings in april for MSFT were a no-brainer for anyone who knew even a bit about the company. Post-earnings decay was also visible from after amazon's statement.

Every time period is different but on a short enough timeframe with well known variables and no surprises ""timing the market"" doesn't amount to much. Of course it also involves putting an amount you're comfortable losing and stop losses in case shit happens but that's that.",postblitz,1,/r/stocks/comments/narq4c/lesson_learned_from_buying_the_dip/gxwedg2/,0.089,0.747,0.165,0.9729
126,CRWD," There numbers are actually really great. Way better than a lot of high PS multiple companies out there.

Take for example NET. I love NET, but they put up revenue numbers of $145M for Q1 and projections of $616M for 2021. That If they hit their revenue projections, their forward P/S becomes 36 compared to the 49 it is today. So while I love NET, I see NET sliding into the 60's to hit a future P/S of 30.

Unity on the other hand is at a current P/S of 30, and their revenue numbers out did expectations and they upped their guidance. They expect to make $1B in revenues in 2021. This puts their future P/S at 20! Which is much more palatable than NET (or even CRWD).

The great thing about Unity also is their operating margin is 76%, which is similar to other high growth darling tech companies like CRWD and NET.

I think Unity is priced to perfection right now. I could see it slide in the high 70's due to greater market forces clobbering growth right now, where it has a current P/S of 25 and a future P/S of 17. But right now, if you're willing to hold for 1+ years, this earnings report is great.

Also, like OP pointed out, Unity is expanding its use cases. They're moving beyond gaming and focusing on virtual worlds to augment modern enterprise solutions. This is something that NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang talked about during his NVIDIA Key Note that he called ""Digital Twins"". I think this market place is nascent and has far reaching capabilities. If Unity goes in this direction, they could easily become a market leader in a new market of virtual reality training and architecture.

tldr. Unity's been beaten down enough that these numbers may provide confidence in entering Unity at this price point.

Remember when people complained that valuations didn't make sense? 

SNAP was worth the same as WFC. Sure, SNAP is a growing company, and WFC has a history of controversies.

But WFC makes 20bn in a non-covid year. They made 4.8bn in the recent quarter. SNAP lost 286mil in the recent quarter.

It didn't make sense for both of them to be worth 80-90bn. 

So WFC after having doubled is still trading under 10PE. If interest rates rise, bank interest margins may even improve.

241,IMO," institutional investors don’t make the majority of their money off of their investments. But their clients’ wealth. 

As such, imagine that your entire investment portfolio principal is base on a margin which can get called at any given point. Whether it’s doing well but more likely if it’s doing poorly.

Or if it doesn’t seem doing comparably well to other alternatives.

For them it’s not a marathon like your individual investor.

It’s a perpetual game of one-upping the competition in some perverse gladiatorial obstacle course where all the wealthy patrons are watching to see which one to “sponsor” in the next quarter.

242,ATH," I think a lot of people are discounting the fact that if there was another shock to the system or long persistent, high inflation (which also has it's own reflexivity with the rest of the market structure); this could potentially turn into a drawn out bear market.

It's been 12 years since an actually serious bear market and you would only understand if you've lived through it. (incoming Ok boomer)

Sure we're not living in 2008 days with massive fraud in mortgages but many times in history markets have gotten ahead of itself and what could happens is a long slog back to mean reversion.

Could it have been the start in this Feb? We won't know until a year later probably.

The idea that the Fed has largely been a tailwind for the last 10 years should not be lost on market participants. We are at close to zero interest rates already and inflation is a limiting factor for additional monetary/fiscal support. 

The idea of taking chips off the table is fairly attractive right now compared to a potential 2 year bear market. It really is painful situation. No one knows the future though so these few months could just be another buying opportunity for the next ATH.

With the potential for a yield increase in bonds--which makes bonds look more attractive and stocks less so--plus the potential for a tax increase, doesn't it make sense to take profits when you see the market stagnate?

I think you're assuming that smart money is afraid instead of making a reasoned bet on what the future holds.

Edit - Consider that three weeks ago, I have in my trading journal that when we see ATH + crossing a major benchmark (in this case, 4,000 on the S&P 500), we often see a volatile consolidation period.

272,IMO," That depends on what a crash means in relation to the overall market. There's no actual definition for a crash. When the pandemic hit, that was a legit crash because everything went down really really fast. Meanwhile some people will say today is a crash. It seems to be used more as a buzzword than anything meaningful. 

There are corrections (down 10%-20%) and bear markets (down 20%+). We're already heading down and I think a tried and true correction is on the horizon. Nasdaq is pretty much right there already. There was a lot of money pumped into the market and a pullback with some concerning economic indicators (namely inflation) being a catalyst makes sense.

I don't think we'll head to bear market territory though. Housing market is still strong. The demand for labor is outweighing supply. The economy is reopening and people will be spending money this summer like crazy. Despite the markets not reacting favorably, companies are reporting generally good earnings and keeping guidance in line. 

So, IMO, I don't see anything serious on the horizon for the overall market but at the same time, people got heavily invested in these tech stocks that went up like 200%+ over the last year that are now looking at 50% drops. They may be good buys now but I think it'll be a long road for them to get back to the valuations they had a few months ago.",kamrali,1,/r/stocks/comments/nanufg/indexes_at_all_time_highs/gxvzr74/,0.056,0.862,0.082,0.8003

287,VERY," Oil. We aren't even fully reopened yet and oil prices are past pre-covid. Heres a couple reasons I think it'll go higher (and why 70% of my portfolio is in it!)

1. Oil is still VERY necessary in our economy. Yes renewables are the future, however the timeline is still 5+ years. The world needs oil for the foreseeable future, and ESPECIALLY in order to make this massive transition to renewables.
2. People are dying to travel and go on vacations. This is assuming COVID ends by mid summer for North America, but the amount of travel by the end of this year is going to be insane. 
3. Oil supply. Well, what's left of it. The oil majors have been burned one too many times. Most probably aren't going to push a lot into capital spending to raise production levels because why would they? They know their commodity isn't the future, so why pour more money into it? They can still reap the benefits of higher revenue simply by cutting back supply. 
4. OPEC. This one is speculative, but I think OPEC has finally realized working together to corner the supply into the market is better than fighting for lowest dollar. Saudi caught everybody off guard a couple months back when they cut production by 1M bb/d, which I don't think they've ever done. Moving forward, I do honestly believe they will work together to ensure higher oil price by cornering supply, but once again its speculative. Maybe not Russia, but nobody likes them. 

Everybody loves to hate oil, but its a necessary evil for the mid term future, and unless that is recognized we are going to wind up in a supply crunch pretty soon.",Fuzzers,14,/r/stocks/comments/naebjr/which_commodities_do_you_think_will_be_the_next/gxtghfy/,0.08,0.808,0.112,0.852

Something like 80%+ of traders/investors do not beat the average market returns of the S&P 500.

As others advised, highly recommend learning about the [TSP](https://www.tsp.gov/how-to-invest/).  If you are going active duty I would recommend utilizing this as your primary retirement account before contributing to a taxable brokerage or Roth IRA.  If you are enlisting and will be under E3 your monthly take home pay is quite low but over time advancements will come and pay increases.

Again, the TSP is fantastic and highly recommend spending time to understand how it works and what each fund consists of.  There's plenty of good pages such as /r/ThriftSavingsPlan /r/MilitaryFinance and of course /r/Bogleheads if you want to learn more about passive index investing.

Although I might not be looking into a 401k since I don't plan on being a full time and or long term employee in a company I'm more of the enterpenuer type although that might change I've heard but I will definitely check TSP in my country out since it sounds like the best investment while I'm actively in service",_SnickerDoodle_,1,/r/stocks/comments/naka6s/stock_advice_long_term_in_army/gxv63py/,0.0,0.726,0.274,0.9654
301,TSP," The thing to remember is that average returns are normally <10% per year.  This recent year with the markets insane recovery from Covid is not something to expect to continue.  I believe the S&P500 has averaged around 7% per year for it's lifetime. Last year people saw nearly 100% returns if you bought in last March during the drop.  You can't plan for these kind of events.  

The [L2065](https://www.tsp.gov/funds-lifecycle/l-2065/) already has a 10.05% YTD return which is incredible but surrounded by the rest of the market I can see how it looks off-putting.   

>  but a huge return will be a godsend interms of what I can do with it to get into other investments

This is true but what happens if the market continues to drop as it has and you're down 30-40% as many people on this forum can show for it. I invest outside of the TSP since I'm no longer in the military and my VTWAX is up nearly 10% YTD, slowly chugging along. The individual stocks I decided to gamble with in January are not doing so hot.





 If you plan on using this money in the next 5-10 years then that could change how you manage your portfolio.  But since you're 18 I think you should consider that you have compounding interest on your side and that you have 40+ years ahead of you where this money can grow.

> I have something against bonds so that's also a thing

Many do but the <1% in the L Fund is basically negligible until you get closer to your retirement date. I think the 2050 versions have around 10-20% bonds.  If this is the case you can copy the splits yourself in C/S/I and leave out the 1% of G/F.

I would recommend starting with an L Fund until you are more comfortable with your investment plan and what you want to do with your money in the future. You can always change your allocations on TSP.  It used to be a pain in the ass years ago but now it's as simple as logging in and being done in minutes.",Rekt_itRalph,1,/r/stocks/comments/naka6s/stock_advice_long_term_in_army/gxv7cr8/,0.052,0.879,0.069,0.8438

327,ANY," I don't get it.  If the stock is good, just hold and average down and you will see massive gains anyways.  It is easier, more profitable, and just as dependable long term as any diverse investing strategy.

If your initial down is 10 grand you can't do this.  If it's 800-1000, you can average down REALLY fast on a big dip.  It's literally not relevant.  Long term investing has higher returns than any other investment.  Furthermore new investors are not good at picking buy prices but are okay at picking good stocks.  This has the least risk in general for new investors with small portfolios, and helps them learn better I think too, by focusing one stock to start.

The problem w Green Energy is that it currently ONLY works w huge subsidies.  Take California Wind Farms.  90% of them built only a few years ago are running but obsolete.  Older ones are being torn down.  On their own, without Government giving the developer either Hard Cash to build them or HUGE tax credits, they don’t stand on their own.  Ecologically? Yes of course green energy is better than coal.  But it’s not perfect either.  Wind Farms kill birds.  Solar is super inefficient and super expensive and makes the land it’s placed in utterly unusable for any other feature.  Wave energy and Nat Gas has issues as well.

369,GME," 
TLDR: SEC rules dictate percentage of funds that platforms must maintain to cover trades, platforms do not process the trades themselves, and it’s up to whatever clearing house the platform uses, type of trade, time of trade and other aspects like volume to determine when funds are available...normally two full business days.

It has to do with the clearing house rules, regulations, volume of trades, etc.  Platforms like Robinhood, Webull, and others don’t process the funds themselves, everything goes through a clearing house.  That process normally takes two business days to complete but can be faster depending on when you compete the action.  The type of action also may have different rules as to when the funds are available ie selling an option vs selling a stock, depending on the trading platform you use.  Each platform has their rules clearly listed somewhere in app.  

Other things that could mess with time funds are available is volume.  Part of the clearing house rules dictated by the SEC state that the trading platform has to maintain a certain percentage of funds per trade.  As an example, Robinhood and other apps had to shut down trading on GME and other highly volatile stocks when the volume exceeded the amount of funds they actually had to cover the trades. Those trades were happening so quickly, that the clearing house did not have time to process them fast enough to maintain whatever balance needed to complete the actions.  Of course, there is also the thing that Robinhoods clearing house also held a large short position in GME so the whole thing looks fishy as hell, but technically, that is why they had to shut down.",Basskickin,2,/r/stocks/comments/naym54/why_is_money_sometimes_immediately_available_for/gxwiyww/,0.033,0.933,0.034,-0.4497

And they have far more US companies they can fuck with than US has. Also not to mention the huge market which they can close to US companies at the blink of an eye. The devastation will be massive on both sides but US will lose far far more. Plus Americans are far more susceptible to those type of loses and far less resistant to market pain.

China plays it cool because time is on their side. They got all the time in the world. Their leaders are more intelligent, hungrier and have long term goals. Chinese population is united, US population is not. Chinese students study engineering and science. American students study business and bean counting.

386,SE," Apple is about 2 trillion. And also thats false logic. Their services are worth at least a trillion according to some experts.

Last point, big fish tend to get bigger over time and this is especially true for a great company like apple. Their revenue beat last quarter was larger than trailing 12 month revenue for 333 s&p companies and thats total revenue. 

Sure SE might get better % returns but how much money would anyone be willing to lay down? A 10% gain on 100k is 10k, while a 30% gain on 20k is under 7k.

388,AAPL," I find that if I check my portfolio every minute, something may have changed and I might be magically up.

Seriously though, probably my biggest mistake in my investing career has not been holding onto stocks long enough. People like to dream and fantasize, look back, and dream like oh, if I held through here I'd have ""x"" amount of dollars. Don't be that person.

Markets always correct, and this year was atypical. I would say prior to this year, I have never seen so much optimism across all markets. People just have the idea that this is how the rich got rich. The truth is you should focus on making money outside of the market to add to your investments. A 10k loss is huge if you make 20k a year, but for someone who makes 100k a year, it's relatively not as much.

Social media, reddit, etc. are just passing the idea that this is how you get rich from 0 to 1m. The truth is a lot of these people are selling classes, making ad rev, or pumping some random BS shit. I have said this in many posts, people take their investments too hard. I've heard people say AAPL is gonna go down, but I have never taken it offensively.

390,VLO," This might not be popular here, but start watching sectors. One sector might get totally destroyed while the overall market is crushing it. Get into those sectors. 

For instance, I bought a bunch of oil stocks back in October because I felt the broader market was way too frothy and I saw traffic coming back in a major way and thought oil was way oversold. My portfolio was up most of today and closed just barely down. I currently have a big position in XOM and VLO and each has over an 8% dividend yield from where I bought them. Even if they don't move up another nickel for 5 years, I'm content with where I got in. 

There are sector SPYDERS that you can use for this strategy. XLE for oil, XLF for financials, XLU for utilities and several others. You have to watch the news. Wait for people to hate, I mean absolutely HATE, a sector. Then you buy it. These sector SPYDERS cover a whole bunch of economically foundational industries that aren't going away in the blink of an eye and there is almost always some sector that is majorly out of favor. 

You'll go red sometimes. For perspective, the NASDAQ kissed 5,000 in spring of 2000. It had doubled in a year. It was up from 1500 to 5000 in something like 18 months and then quickly drilled to sub 2000 and even sub 1500 by 2002. In 2009 it was back down to like 1200 or 1300 and since then it has been on a 10x run. It took 15 years to peak at 5k and get to 5k again. 

The absolute key is to dollar cost average in and stick with it for years and years. $100 a week or whatever. You might have bought a top and it might drill and not recover for 10 years.

Yeah. The market goes up and down. Since the 70s there have probably been at least 5 major crashes I've lived through. There was a crash in the mid 1980s, I think 1987, and that was when I learned that crashes are temporary and if you have the funds to buy into them. It was a valuable lesson.
