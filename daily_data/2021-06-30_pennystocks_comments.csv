I don't really care for the squeeze, or to the moon etc. I saw that there were potential from where they were and bought some share. My only regrets are not buying more. This is however not the case with many other stocks. There are stocks that I am still waiting on to hit 100% mark and some I have no hope for ever recovering but don't have much investment in.

If you want to hold, make sure you do your DD and check to see if it's worth holding.

WRONG. That just means you get into shit and less at a loss, what kind of plan is that?

The real issue is jumping into things without DD, without knowing what catalysts to look for, and panicking when things are red.

I was in the same boat as you. I bought a lot during the Feb boom, and everything tanked. I was down ~12k at one point, -25%.

""Total revenues for the year ended March 31, 2021 increased by $7.4 million or 41%, to $25.4 million, as compared to $18.0 million for the prior year, primarily due to revenues earned fromAmphetamine ER Capsules, which were launched during the current fiscal year, increased revenues fromAmphetamine IR Tablets, as compared to the prior year, offset by decreases in license fee revenues resulting from the full amortization of SequestOxTM milestone revenues occurring in June 2020 and accordingly providing partial year contribution to revenues during the year ended March 31, 2021, while contributing a full year of revenues to the prior year.....

Our gross profit margin was 47% during the year ended March 31, 2021 as compared to 44% during the comparable prior fiscal during the year ended March 31, 2021, as year.""

Net income from profits (they are finally profitable) is going to decrease in the coming years as they are going to be entering clinical trials on undisclosed compounds.  Once that happens, the price is going to rise.

This company has been historically been dog-shit because they were focused on opiate generics and 'non-abusable' opiate formulations.  With the litigation and opiate epidemic, they completely had to pivot. They  recently became profitable by manufacturing ADHD medication (and are doing well).  They will also be selling loxapine capsules for the first time this year, which will hopefully provide a new revenue stream.  They are now going to take those profits and expand. Like I said, I am long ELTP.  There will be a lot of volatility along the way, and I am prepared for it.  The biggest problem is the number of outstanding shares.

Edit: I can't find many profitable companies selling for 0.05 cents a share.  This is one.  I am very open to seeing others if anyone knows of any.",sickeye3,6,/r/pennystocks/comments/ob0xf3/penny_stocks_are_not_for_holding/h3lbqdi/,0.032,0.837,0.131,0.9794

Also, I didn't ""mock"" anyone, I just pointed out that one red day is nothing to worry over. 3 red days, with fairly little buying pressure acting as support, however, is. Especially with marketmakers de-hedging because of the price drops. 

So I sold this morning, because I had decided to distance myself from the high risk I was in, especially after being up 120%. I'll still be able to profit off further developments if they happen.
