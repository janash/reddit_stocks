3,GNUS," GNUS has been around forever, but never gained much traction. However, in the age of streaming we are starting to see the fruits of their labor. Several of their shows are becoming household names. They are adding major celebrities to their lineup. Not to mention there are rumors of a Disney partnership.

Been trading that one for about 4 months now.  IDEX puts sold for April.  Did well on SOS puts for $97 per contract on a 2.5 strike when it was down at the low 3s and banked -$400 on $1k collateral.  Assigned on IDRA $3 put last Friday so now I will sell covered calls on that. I use barcharts.com and look at the options, highest IV chart and also the naked puts chart.  These show the better premium options but I realize there is higher risk on large price movements for those generous premiums.",Busy_Print6699,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ma40oz/weekly_options/grqjnnj/,0.043,0.851,0.106,0.7876
