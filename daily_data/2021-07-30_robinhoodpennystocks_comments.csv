1,SPRT," SPRT has been discussed a LOT. Due to its popularity, I review its movement and results in a post on this sub daily about unusual option activity. 

What other kind of discussion are you looking for? Folks tend to get quiet about a stock once it pulls back.",Itsboomhomie,8,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/oumauv/sprt_umm_hello/h73hzwm/,0.0,0.933,0.067,0.4767
2,ATOS," Especially when the stock literally has *already spiked in in your face*. 

People expect WAY too much at times. I remember feeling like I finally got ride a good play to moon with TRCH when it cleared $9 but then I would browse stock boards and see people expecting it to go $30 by the end of the month. Same thing happened to ATOS too. Shot up a ton in June but folks just held it into the dirt in July on the hopes of telegraphed options expiring.
