Part of that is the visibility element - if you really believe in a stock long term you want to establish a position while it's cheap, and not everyone just throws down $10k in a stock at once.

21,CAP, Im probably going to get down voted but I think its mostly pump a dumps man. To put it in a nice way the idea of looking at a stock specifically because the share price is below $1 is pretty dubious at best. The reason is because looking at 1 share of a company tells you almost nothing about a company. Consider a company worth 100 Billion (Market Cap) if they had 200 Billion shares outstanding each share would only be worth .50 cents thus it would be considered a penny stock. In this case the share price would hardly move because inorder for the price of one share to increase just 10% the companies value would have to increase by 10 Billion. This is why you should instead be focusing on MARKET CAP look for companies that have low total values but you deem are decent buisnesses. A company growing from a market cap of 10 Million to 100 Million is a lot easier than a company growing from 50 Million to 500 Million but in bothe cases the share price would 10x. What im getting at is the price of an individual share DOES NOT MATTER! This is true for all companies.,Rjlv6,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/mijnah/do_people_genuinely_believe_in_the_stocks_theyre/gt5p4u0/,0.046,0.668,0.286,0.9956
22,DD, Don't trust any penny stock. Do your own DD and see what you think. Manage your risk and take profits. 99.9% of penny stocks crash and burn just take a look at the long terms charts. I learned my lesson by believing in the hype and not taking profits. A lot of people got lucky in January and February because the OTC market as a whole had about a 10x increase in volume. That's why the markets came back down in March. It's not market manipulation its people who were ahead of the hype taking their profits. I think April will be a good month with stimulus checks finally rolled out as a whole and tax refunds hitting accounts.

23,DD," I believe in Bitcoin (somewhat).  In that I believe other people believe in it.  Meaning I believe it will go up over time.  But I REALLY believe in companies that make bitcoin.  They literally have the ability to make something out of nothing.  That's a hell of a business model.  They have really low overhead - except for internet and electricity.  No need to stock product, no supply chain issues, not much in terms of wages.

33,BIG," I've noticed that a lot of stocks posted here are already pumped pretty significantly. These days I'll only look further into it for two things:


1. The company looks really interesting

2. There hasn't been a huge ""blast off"" rise yet


In case #1 usually waiting a few weeks there'll be a big dip and I can get in at a lower price. In case #2 it's a big mix. 


It's very hard to tell which stocks are going to continue going up when they've already doubled in the last month, or more, because some definitely will but now I'm bag holding maybe $2000 worth of various stocks because I got on board the reddit hype train when it was already leaving the station.


Even if companies posted here DO have potential but there's the factors of competent management, environment (ie some of the covid stocks I thought had potential I've been bag holding since the vaccine roll out began and I hate the idea of selling in the red) 


And then yeah there's many that are clearly awful if you dig below the surface and look past the chatter of people pumping them on Twitter and here lol


In summary: the biggest gains are to be had early in the companies life but it's also the biggest risk. If people are talking about it a lot on reddit the pump has probably already happened. Most the time I see people got in at pennies and by the time I found it and bought the dip it there was a double dip... Then a triple... Lol. Everyone, including me, is looking for those BIG short term gains, and by the time it's here that's already happened for the most part. Of course I want to turn $1K into $10k in under a month, but historically speaking people who do that got in to a newer company when it was <10¢ and most of the sub ten cent stocks we see here are diluted to shit already.

64,DD," The stock market is entirely a game of using “financial instruments” as they have named it, to make a profit.

All the players in this game are, the companies that provide the financial instrument, the institutions responsible for “regulating” the game, as they proclaim, and two types of investors, single individuals, and non-non individual entity (anybody with any support of any other single individual human being, it would be more specific to list all entities that are not just one person with his own effort and thought).

These players just play a game thats been set up there before they were born.

Even the regulators think they are not players, it is the curse of using already established structure rather than building anything from the ground up every time for everyone. Like becoming President, or being born a king, even though you didnt originally conquer the country and build the army that did it from scratch. (Im babbling at this point but ill get back to it) 

So dont feel bad for any negatives youve ever had, nor things you cant change, be more than just human, ascend into mastery like Jesus, or the first monkey to hit a rock together.

So there is a game in the playground called the stock market, as with any game there are rules. The rules of this game do not prohibit you “advertise” a stock, however the same rules that allows you to post a DD publicly without getting punished is the same rule that allows the opposite side of the spectrum, where their true purpose IS TO PUMP AND DUMP, because guess what, money is both evil and good, and its not illegal to want to make money or to care only about money.

So lets get back to the same point that stops us all from moving forward. The effort of changing the rules, i.e new game plus, or doing everything over again but with a lot more starting resources (hello responsible players?) or another great solution that has never been implemented correctly is akin to a “rules dictatorship”.

We need to specify how you play the game better, also, heres a question, why make a game cheatable? 

If there are cheats to games or rules, and our 8 billion human population are not able to, in unison, come to a consensus, as one ☝️ global tribe, then youre question is much greater than simply a doubt over the honesty of some people, but the existence of evil, which is less practical than questioning which rules allow for results you find unfair.

74,FB," I am heavy on Biopharma. Even my apps suggest that I diversify.So I also own a few memestocks and funstocks as well.. 

I believe as we recover from the immediate medical crisis, we'll be forced to switch gears toward the longer term health impacts of not only the virus, but also sitting indoors for a year. 

Based on what I'm seeing in the survivor forums and read online, I've formed a theory.

I think we'll see rises in cancer, heart attack and stroke, fertility, hair loss, dermatology and immunology AND as a result the Biopharma stocks that develop the correlated meds.

There's several FB page dedicated to long haulers, and I've been watching the medical complaints and commentary. 

Here's what I've noticed:
1. Long haulers who were later diagnosed with cancer, doc thinks related to virus impact.
2. Hair loss complaints (this may be the most common).
3. Reporting doc thinks a hole in the heart was caused by the virus.
4. Lately a number of people commenting that they had mild symptoms but later discovered related cancer, heart issues and hair loss.

I've also found a few articles that suggest fertility issues may be virus related 

I think there may be a rise in sympathy stocks like medical equipment, consumer goods (pharmacy) or esthetics.

One challenge here is to figure out which companies may bring successful drugs to market and which meds will get killed off in trials. I mainly like lower cost stocks as I think despite an increased risk, I like possibility of strong sudden gains.

In currently holding: Onconova, Evofem, Isoray, Sologenix, Soleno,  Salarius and Acasti and watching several others.

I think its possible that if we see reports in the news of an increase in cancer diagnosis, we'll also see increases in Cannabis consumption and stock value and health and wellness retailers, supplements... I only hold 1 cannabis stock atm, but may diversify my holdings down the line.

I have not been holding anything ""long."" Something rises and i take some profit. Falls and I might buy a dip.

\*\*\*MARCH 2021 UPDATES\*\*\*

&#x200B;

March 30, 2021

&#x200B;

Perimeter Medical Imaging AI announced that Dr. Beth DuPree, a surgeon at Northern Arizona Healthcare Verde Valley Medical Center, expects to enroll up to 100 patients in a study that will evaluate the use of Perimeter’s Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Imaging System during breast conserving surgery.

&#x200B;

Highlights of this press release:

•	The clinical study led by Dr. DuPree aims to demonstrate that surgeons can effectively use Perimeter’s OCT Imaging System during a clinical procedure to aid their decisions;

•	The data will calculate the percentage of patients that require a second surgery; (The goal is to reduce re-operation rate)

•	Perimeter continues working closely with clinician users to ensure that the Perimeter OCT Imaging System can be easily integrated into current intraoperative workflows.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The company has recently received the US FDA 510(k) clearance on the advanced OCT imaging tools, which marks an important milestone that we are now in the commercialization stage. On top of that, we have just added $8.3MM to the balance sheet due to warrant exercise, and this funds will be contributing to the sales efforts going forward.

Perimeter Medical Imaging AI announced that Dr. Beth DuPree, a surgeon at Northern Arizona Healthcare Verde Valley Medical Center, expects to enroll up to 100 patients in a study that will evaluate the use of Perimeter’s Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Imaging System during breast conserving surgery.

&#x200B;

Highlights of this press release:

•	The clinical study led by Dr. DuPree aims to demonstrate that surgeons can effectively use Perimeter’s OCT Imaging System during a clinical procedure to aid their decisions;

•	The data will calculate the percentage of patients that require a second surgery; (The goal is to reduce re-operation rate)

•	Perimeter continues working closely with clinician users to ensure that the Perimeter OCT Imaging System can be easily integrated into current intraoperative workflows.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The company has recently received the US FDA 510(k) clearance on the advanced OCT imaging tools, which marks an important milestone that we are now in the commercialization stage. On top of that, we have just added $8.3MM to the balance sheet due to warrant exercise, and this funds will be contributing to the sales efforts going forward.

I think no one really knows what the game is right now after almost every penny stock soared hundreds to thousands of percentage points.

For example, I have been in and out of CZNI and NBRI multiple times. I just recently sold CZNI at .0013 (bought at .0011) and it went all the way to like .0025. That is fine, I still profited, and I will wait until it drops again. There is no DD about that, but it is the only reliable way I have found to make money in penny stocks lately.

180,ALL," The plan isn't flawed, just the execution. Make sure you take a look into stop limit, stop loss, and set an exit strategy. At that point you'll know you lose X if it goes down, you'll gain A for your investment, and a potential multiplier B if you own more than 1. Contracts (C) is just a minus with the potential for gain or loss (profit is limited, loss is not.) ROI (return of investment) so if math is good and crayons work...  

( \[ A - X% \] x B) - C  = ROI

ex.

(A) You pay $10 to get in.

(X%) Goes down equals loss, goes up equals zero

(B) invested stock total

(C) contracts calls/puts

(ROI) return of investment

The plan is not flawed if you intend to make gains, only the execution if you lose to much or get greedy and wait for the spike to end (round and round it goes, where it stops... nobody knows) as that's where stop loss and stop limit become your friend (remember that your brokerage and others can see it, so they know when and where to bump that number down to eat those gains, you control your destiny). At what point are you committed to making it long, or taking the small/big losses/gains and investing in the areas you seek to grow. You BUY a stock with the intention of selling it for a gain. At least that's what I been lead to believe, not sure if it's for everyone ;)

190,BP," The roughnecks come with the drilling contractor. Your Toolpusher, driller, derrickman, floorhands, motorman, electrician, roust-a-bouts, etc., they are contracted for the duration of the well (though individuals can get run-off for misconduct or personality issues), and usually come out for multiple week hitches in rotation. Same with all the service hands, such as the mud man, directional driller, mwd hand, mud logger, geologist.  And then you have your ops like wireline and cement that only come out when needed.

256,DD," Can I just take a moment to plug Goldspot Discoveries Corp (GDDCF)? This is a profitable company (netting $5mil this year already on an over 300% increase in annual revenue) with a great balance sheet, multiple press releases a month proving that their technology works, and a market cap of only $30 mil.

The ONLY issue with it is that it trades on low volume, and I cant for the life of me understand why - insanely undervalued.

264,AMD," I'm relatively new, but had some minor activity back in 2015 when I decided to throw $2k into the market with various stocks and let them sit, mostly Disney. Bought AMD at 2.25 in 2015 sold at $93 last month (not many shares but a substantial chunk of change). Bought MARA at 1.30 last year (not a lot of shares). I bought a lot crypto miners in Dec and they all went up shortly after. My numerous relatively small investments had me on pace to becoming halfway to a millionaire this year, then March happened... I'm still doing well, but I am no longer anywhere near that trajectory. I say have patience. I bought OZSC at like . 0077 or something like that in August based on a tip then. Was losing a lot money on it then and just wanted to break even but it ended up spiking and so I stuck with it. Could have made good money with that if I sold at the end of Feb, but such is life. I can still sell and keep some serious gains there.

Of course I have a lot stinkers too, like CBBT, and then SNPW and SSFT have cost me, but we all know these stocks are risky. Fortunately my winners have more than made up for my losses and covered those risks. This sub has made me a lot of money, but with more activity recently on this sub you have to be more careful. I was looking at my shares last night and nearly everything profitable to me I held for over 4 months, where most of my red are from purchases over the last two. 

I say have patience if you believe in the company and diversify your portfolio. As you see, some of the tickers mentioned are going to hit and there are quite a few successes here, but you don't want to be all in one that ends up not which there are also many of.

Also, think of this as a pyramid scheme, you'll want to be the first one on it. With that mindset try to restrain from chasing. Like me buying into crypto miners in December, or OZSC in August.  I might have an excessive portfolio, but I have my money split between 40 or so shares, I don't put that much into each, so if any tank its not the end for me.

If memory serves they are currently being tested for approval to be used in Florida, but I’m being lazy and that was something I read a month ago so... maybe not 100% correct. 

The value proposition is that current steel reinforced concrete doesn’t last very long because concrete is porous. Water permeates the concrete and rusts the steel reinforcement. Rust is less dense than steel so it expands and cracks the concrete. This is part of the reason so much of America’s infrastructure is crumbling. So basalt fiber reinforcement would lead to longer lasting more durable infrastructure. 

Someone did a pretty decent DD on BASA’s tech a month or two ago if anyone is interested in more details.

301,CAN," First rule is don’t invest in anything you aren’t willing to lose. I unfortuantely dont have a crystal ball so who knows what Monday will bring, but one thing you could keep an eye on is bitcoin. Should bitcoin be at 61 plus, the following stocks are likely to go up: MARA (although it has has a good run up this week so it might need more than 61 to pump hard), CAN, RIOT, BRPHF, and HVBTF. CAN RIOT and MARA all trade in pre and post market hours - so the run up could (or could not) happen in pre market before market opens. I generally don’t touch premarket as it is very volatile. So just be aware of that. 

There are others, but I should say a few things about them: SOS is currently down bc of an offering. I wouldn’t touch it. EBON same thing, so I’m not sure when those will rebound. ARBKF is great but moves slowly because it’s not on nasdaq and most brokers charge a $50 fee (fidelity and a few others), HUTMF also. Be careful because all of these respond heavily to bitcoin. Don’t get greedy. And again, don’t invest what you aren’t willing to lose. Also, none of those are going to x2 your money. Sometimes pennystocks will do this in a day, but you have to be very very lucky and/or do a lot of research finding a catalyst before the masses do.

306,AAPL," Sorry if I’m off base, but how much is $100 to you? Is losing this much money going to be a major problem? 

If the answer is that you’re ok with potentially losing $100, then my next advice is to not go into this thinking I want to spend X money on Monday, and instead I want to bet X money that Y stock will increase in value. In penny land, you need to be extra careful since these are extra volatile and don’t always do what you expect. Honestly, if you want to see $100 grow next week, I’d invest in AAPL. It won’t grow 100% but it has a better chance of gaining a few %. If you are really feeling risky, then take some time to browse this sub and keep in mind many “DD” posts are about stocks that have already peaked. A “safer” penny stock I can recommend is RYCEY (Rolls-Royce, as in plane engines), it’s a longer term thing but a decent chance of growing your $100 this year.",helloretrograde,7,/r/pennystocks/comments/midpb2/looking_for_advice_for_monday/gt46bqr/,0.072,0.727,0.201,0.9697
