0,ADMP, To whoever commented asking if ADMP calls are a good play... I can't say as I haven't done enough research on the company and also am not comfortable giving investment advice in this forum.,Itsboomhomie,4,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/owomlf/penny_stock_unusual_option_activity_82/h7hxydw/,0.133,0.786,0.081,-0.2115

5,BBIG," I've tried to mention stop losses and whether or not the merger is priced in. BBIG was one that started gaining traction around the same time as SPRT (also off merger hype and partly Atlas pump) and the day the merger was announced as final the stock fell. But each situation is unique.

I think the teachable point I want to get across the most is picking exit points. Everybody always talks about entry signals but don't mention exit strategies besides making bank. Consistent exits may provide less total profit on certain trades, but can balance out with more consistent winners over time.",Itsboomhomie,4,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/owomlf/penny_stock_unusual_option_activity_82/h7isuvm/,0.031,0.843,0.126,0.8898

7,INFI," I honestly don't know much about either company. INFI first made this list when the stock dropped after earnings and a drug update, but then received two separate price target upgrades. It's yo yo-ed a bit, but has moved stronger toward the upside.

I wish price targets came with expectant timeliness. The price could fall with holders taking profit or continue to march on.",Itsboomhomie,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/owomlf/penny_stock_unusual_option_activity_82/h7iserm/,0.0,0.814,0.186,0.9153
8,INFI," Yeah INFI sounds familiar as a day trade indicator or something. Which makes sense because itâ€™s a pharma co. 

SNCR baffles me. Itâ€™s a tech co, been around since 2000 and itâ€™s a cloud, software, business/medical space area. Itâ€™s weird that their price is low, and analysts have 2 buys rated on them. I think they are trying to be the jack of all trades when it comes to tech instead of just focusing on a few specifics. They employ like 2,000 people so itâ€™s established.",bgj556,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/owomlf/penny_stock_unusual_option_activity_82/h7j1tuf/,0.046,0.898,0.056,0.2263

I started with 20k, and I have made $14k off dogecoin, $10,000 off Sgoc, $8,000 off Xela, and so far a small bit off of CLNN (bought in at $8.00)....those were all ''meme stocks'' with a high risk....they weren't stable well performing gold mine stocks like Amazon. If you want safe investments, go invest in Amazon, Google, Apple etc....why are you even here. I thought this whole thing was to make quick money and buy stocks before they rise. If you are in it for the long haul, you no which stocks to buy, but if you want to make good money in a short span, that is the strategy, it has worked for me, and this seems to be a very low risk compared to the others. So although it was a very low effort post, in which I apologize, I can see how it looked now....it is not as far fetched as you think.",lou5007,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ownxj2/clnn_is_so_unknown_but_will_be_very_know_very/h7jkopz/,0.088,0.74,0.171,0.9696
