1,CRSR," RAZFF has about the same market cap has CRSR. I did some quick math and 17.46B HKD is a little over 2 billion USD (2.24B to be exact) which is around what CRSR is sitting at (2.58B), yet CRSR trades around $27 USD. So I would say RAZFF is still doing ok, but they just have more shares out in circulation bringing their share price down.",always_on_top123,4,/r/pennystocks/comments/p31ak5/razer_razff_continued_improvements/h8o53w0/,0.0,0.885,0.115,0.7677
