The closest Walmart and the only one I’ve been to in recent years (and it’s now been a good 3 years since I’ve been inside one) is pretty bare bones and not well kept, not very desirable to go there IMO. They are without a doubt popular though, the parking lots always seem pretty full.

16,USA," Do I wish everyone on earth lived comfortably and had a cushy job? Sure. But that isn't reality. Companies exist to make money. Some companies see a benefit either morally or to thier bottom line to give all of thier employees lots of benefits, and if they can do it successfully then great. Other companies wouldn't be able to compete, or simply don't care. That is just humanity. Not sure how to fix that problem. But I do know that in the USA, if you are able and still working a shitty job that makes you pee in bottles for shitty pay, at some point you have come to grips that the problem is yourself. You probably think I sound cold and uncaring, but what I have learned in my 30 something years is that a lot of people are just unwilling to put any effort in improving themselves or thier situation, and hope that someone else comes along and fixes it for them. I just dont have much pity for those people. I am not far right, I hate Trump so much it hurts, but I also don't think the collective needs to bail these people out.

But people are irrational and fear is enough to make an effect. If you have a $100K CAD into the US market, a 10 cent raise in CAD to USD means an unrealized loss of $10,000 in a few months. So Canadians have to make the choice to either stick with the US market and leave the money there until the dollar goes down again, or buy into TSE or elsewhere.

1. High short ratio & low float potentially making it a meme target (this can be good and/or bad).
2. Fairly steady and reasonable valuation for the past few months at a low P/E.
3. Corsair earnings have shown nice growth.
4. Most of the outstanding shares are held by a private equity firm that is slowly selling those shares to the open market. I think this has kept the price down but also they seem to taking care not to depress the price too much.

Look at the bottom chart in particular.

The forces  (mostly sales of improved cloud services) that drove the yoy bump  in revenues in 2017-8 have moved on (and clearly had in 2019). Different forces drove the 2020-1 bump.

They need to somehow keep that growth rate up.

How are they going to do it? Cloud is old tech now. International expansion has some opportunities, but are they as big as locking half the world in their houses with their TVs and computers and credit cards, and offering same-day shipping on a bag of chips?

159,RKT," Probably got extra cash from incredibly high lumber prices and didn't want to invest in expansion due to the cyclical nature of the industry. Lumber price seems like it has dropped a lot from its peak but still has a little bit more to go to reach its Feb/March prices. I'd probably wait a week or 2 until closer to the 28th, just to see if lumber price does drop further. It's a nice dividend so I'd definitely still get in for it (short term wise)

Edit : it's an interesting play. only 1bil market cap, 85% institutional ownership, P/E 11, P/S 0.4, near  support around 13$, lumber price approaching March support levels.

165,RFP," RFP is 1.05b market cap. But if still not allowed, I guess there's always exposure from other subreddit. Maybe next week, its share price will increase enough to meet WSB requirement.

168,TGA," There is so much cash at the front of the curve and low T-Bill supply from the TGA pay down that money market funds have no where else to go but the Fed RRP. It is less painful than potentially have to earn negative rates on your cash.

Imagine you are a money market fund manager and you have $500 million cash. This cash came from a bank like Goldman who is looking to reduce its balance sheet constraint from a recent large deposit from a client and is charging deposit fees (negative rates). Ok so now what? I have all this cash and will have to pay this fee to Goldman unless I do something with it. Since there are no interest options given the abundance of cash across the market, you go to the RRP at 0% Better than earning nothing and having to pay fees right?

Why not just buy t-bills if you are a MMF? Well, because of the TGA pay down, there is just not enough bill supply out there. This has been the issue since April and why you have seen a dramatic rise in the RRP facility 

The Fed needs to taper. Their overnight reverse repo facility hit over half a trillion dollars this week.",jejakqmqm,14,/r/stocks/comments/nwyt9h/us_reverse_repo/h1byrun/,0.092,0.834,0.073,0.1728

206,AE," Bullish on American Eagle Outfitters (AEO).

1. Technical pattern in a consolidating bull-flag since March, which matched their previous peak way back in August 2018 pre-pandemic.
2. Going into peak sales season of summer/fall. Swim vacation summer, back to school.
3. **Aerie** has been a runaway hit for them, growing to close to a 10% share of the women's underwear and lingerie market, all this while Victoria's Secret continues to lose share at a precipitous pace, down from 32% to 21% in the last five years. Aerie has grown sales in Q1 2021 89% yoy, **online sales grew 160%** yoy, and operating margin grew to 26%, meaning that they are at an inflection point to take full advantage of operating leverage and convert incremental sales to profits.
4. I see continued momentum into Aerie, and in a best case scenario, I could see them **PASSING VICTORIA'S SECRET in market share in five years**, especially as malls continue to die, and especially if they continue to build upon synergies in their [growing ath-leisure, lounge and swimware lines.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurendebter/2021/01/21/aerie-looks-to-double-sales-to-2-billion-as-shoppers-ditch-victorias-secret/?sh=2006326750a4) Aerie's OFFL/NE label, as a lower cost ath-leisure alternative to Lululemon, has been picking up a whole lot of steam among Tik Tok influencers.
5. Huge things happen to returns when you pass a respected market leader in a slow moving industry. DPZ (Dominos Pizza) returned gains to investors outpacing Amazon over the past ten years, as they slowly overtook Pizza Hut in market share for the first time. These things don't happen often, but when they do, cash in. Aerie has an outside chance to pull it off......... Assume Victoria's secret doesn't grow (as it hasn't been) and revenue is stuck around 7B/year. Aerie is at 1B in revenue, growing >50% per year. At 50% growth rates per year, they will do it in 5 years.
6. **I see the Jeans segment, though stagnant for years, to pick up in the next year for their flagship American Eagle brand, because jeans are undergoing their first supercycle change in 20 years, as skinnies head out the door and relaxed/mom styles, high waists, boyfriends, wides, flares and skater/JNCO cuts all compete for dominance of Gen Z/Alpha.** AE is smartly positioned in all of these categories. Expect their AE line to grow in line with other jeans comparables like Levi Strauss.
7. Consumer non-durable stock that will do well in a higher inflation environment
8. I bought long-dated options today at a strike price of 25. I've gone all-in on [hot girl summer](https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2021-04-22/la-guide-post-covid-vaccine-shot-girl-summer) by buying long dated options on underwear and beer (AEO and TAP)",AngelaQQ,2,/r/stocks/comments/nxbup3/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_jun/h1f524l/,0.029,0.877,0.094,0.9661

231,DD," 'I haven’t seen evidence that anyone really spends much time helping anyone else'

There is some good reason behind this.  On reddit, you're mostly talking to people who are not professional investors.  I can offer you an opinion on a stock based on my 4 months of experience, but I'm not going to have the depth of knowledge about the company, industry and risk factors to make an overly informed opinion.  I may be happy risking my money on something because I know the limitations of my knowledge.  I'm probably not going to make recommendations on what other people should do with thousands of dollars, though.

Proper DD takes a very long time to do correctly.  You need to spend time researching the company and the wider industry, the overall movement of the economy and technology and risks.  It's so much more than earnings reports and projected growth.  That sort of stuff isn't going to be learned in an hour - large firms have teams of people that do it as full time jobs, and even then they still get it wrong.

If you want to post or message a DD of yours, I'd be happy to critique it and tell you where I think you're missing things (with the context that I'm relatively new at this myself).  Or, if you give me a list of companies you'd like to see dd for then I can see if there's any that I'm confident enough to look at, but it's likely to be a long list of 'here's something I don't know about this company/industry).",RumHam1,4,/r/stocks/comments/nxbup3/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_jun/h1ew9fa/,0.054,0.852,0.093,0.8968

417,NIO," Who else got their NIO ticket already? 


Even at the current price NIO is still hugely undervalued. The only reason I can think of is because it's a Chinese company and many people are skeptical or have been burned by one in the past. However, NIO continues to prove the haters wrong.

Despite the current chip shortage, NIO has still managed to increase YoY deliveries. At the same time they have managed to improve upon their already impressive margins.

Although their market reach is limited mostly to China right now, that will change in the very near future. They are slated to reach the European market in September, and my guess is that it won't be too long before it reaches the U.S. too. And when that happens, it certainly doesn't hurt that Brian Deese, the head of the National Economic Council, has previous ties to BlackRock, which has a large stake in NIO.

There are several articles available in which owners of both NIO and Tesla vehicles discuss their experiences with both. And the vast majority end with claims that after driving the NIO, they won't go back. 

NIO has been downplayed by too many for far too long. It won't be long before the stock price hits triple digits. Get your ticket before it leaves for the moon.",jmains45,-2,/r/stocks/comments/nxd8d1/rstocks_daily_thread_on_meme_stocks_friday_jun_11/h1fm01q/,0.054,0.873,0.073,0.3769

Based on my limited experience.   My stock was at about 10.00, purchased 17 calls at 12.50 strike price.  Stock is a little over 11 now, and I've made an unrealized profit of 41.5% on my calls.

VGAC is the stock mine are in. Merger vote happened yesterday, merger on the 16th.

The numbers you are looking at, come into play if you plan on exercising.  Only a very small percent of people who purchase options actually exercise them.

447,WISH," Thank you for your help. 

I bought one call of WISH to play with because I am new with options (I usually only buy stocks)

With that being said, I bought one call of WISH, which is currently at $10.90
I believe it will hit $12.50 by July 16th. 
It is telling me that to break even I have to hit at least $14.20
So does that mean that if I don’t hit $14.20 then I won’t make any money at all? And that I’ll lose the $185 I paid for the call?
And does that mean that if it hits $15.20 I only made $50 off of the call?

What happens if it hits a number like $17 or $18? Is the call useless because no one will buy it at that point? Sorry for all the questions",Kaylaasksquestions93,1,/r/stocks/comments/nxcq1k/question_about_stocks/h1dzpm7/,0.062,0.807,0.131,0.8814

461,GDP," Anyone claiming they can predict exactly when the market is going to crash ignore.

The market is going to crash at some point just due to the private debt and fraud in the system.  The stock market is an open complex system so it’s impossible to predict exactly when and what event(s).  There are some mathematical properties you can’t get away from like the debt is growing far faster than economic growth.  Interest rates can’t go much lower than they are so the debt will not be able to rollover at lower interest rates.  So the defaults will go higher and the money in the system will be destroyed.  This decrease the money supply and cause a liquidity crisis.  Add fraud to the system where the banks don’t trust each other books you have 2008 and March 2020.  The fraud is far worse than 2000 to 2008.

It will cause another financial crisis but the fed will not be able to lower interest rates.  Bonds interest rates can’t go much lower than they already are meaning the price can’t go up much.  This simply means we have no idea what will happening when there is another financial crisis because it depends on what governments do.  They could buy and the toxic assets again like Japan, US, EU, etc been doing.  So far the evidence of doing this lower GDP growth and increase wealth inequality.  Could write down the debts which could cause massive paper losses on assets.  Could go the austerity route which would cause a massive drop in GDP like what Greece experienced after 2008 and massive paper loses on assets.  Could do something no one expects them to do.

With the current inflation caused by supply shocks and second order effects caused by the stimulus is decreasing the velocity of money.  Supply chains have never been this long in human history and manufacturing for certain components limited to a single company like the hardware to make high end computer chips.  We do not know how long it will take to get this worked out.

473,CNQ," No problem. 
 
As for the exposure, a couple of their major projects have reached end of life. Since oil has been so low for so long, they've decided not to find new major projects to replace them since they can't justify the cost. They're very serious about playing it safe and getting the lowest cost for the best return. Our ceo and President literally showed up to the shovel (RH400- worth about $11m) dealer and said if he doesn't get it for 50% off he and our company are walking away and not coming back. He got it.
 
As to the intrinsic value of the company... that's hard, just because it depends so much on oil and gas prices. But if commodity prices stay roughly where they are, I can see them doing really well. They're by far the biggest player in the oil sands now and their largest mine is paid for (other than maintenance and the lease, it's pure cash flow for the next 30 ish years). I won't give a target price (the market and our government are fical bitches) but I will say that I see their cash flow only going up, especially as they buy up companies in our area (Painted Pony was an amazing play last year).
 
They also **increased** their dividend last year, and by a lot too. This is when their biggest competitor, suncor, (whom everyone thought to be the more stable and safe play) slashed their dividend by half and laid off a lot of their work force.

Also, Suncor could absorb CNQ at some point if they wish to be the last man standing, since they are the much larger company.

The only argument I would make against them right now is their price. At just over 200 dollars a share, this puts them at a P/E ratio of 34.44. While they've been dominant in earnings over the pandemic, to expect them to maintain a similar level of dominance in the future as Amazon starts to compete is a harder sell. To justify their current valuation would be to justify paying a premium for earnings that will likely be undervalued by about 20% post-pandemic in the short term. Is that premium really worth it right now for entry?

Having said that, the company has been in a great position to capitalize off of the pandemic, and has done so successfully, justifying a major increase in its stock price. A big part of this price momentum started by the announcement that UPS would commit to using EV's in the future.

525,AAPL," You're not thinking about it correctly.

When I was buying AAPL a few years ago, their dividend yield was higher than it is now despite the fact that they've raised their dividend every year since I originally bought it. So my dividend yield is lower but my cost basis dividend yield is higher.

It's not that MSFT doesn't pay a lot of dividends, it's that their dividends/future dividends are so highly coveted that it makes the yield look low. 

Here's an example: Buffett bought KO between 1988-1994 for a total cost of $1.3B. Since then Buffett has made $8.5B in total dividends. They will pay out $672M in dividends to Berkshire this year on an investment of $1.3B. KO only has a 3% dividend yield, but that is irrelevant because the cash on cash return doesn't care about current unrealized gains. 

So let's say you bought MSFT exactly ten years ago at $23.71, then your cost basis dividend yield would be 9.2%. 

Most importantly, you wouldn't have to sell shares to receive that payment. That's the problem with appreciation, you have to sell a productive asset (shares) in order to receive an unproductive asset (cash), and even worse, the cash value for your shares is net taxes.

535,OR," Step 1 - Pick a brokerage (I always suggest your banks for easy money transfer)

Step 2 - Read into the terminology (Podcasts, YT videos, Text) - Just please stay away from ""financial gurus"" or anyone saying they will get you some stupid 100% + returns easily or be careful of people selling courses and what not. Books - Intelligent Investor or Investopedia the website has a TON of great articles surf through all of them there.

Step 3 - Maybe look into index ETFs to begin with those are considered ""Safe"" (lack of a better word in finance since nothing is technically safe). Indexes like tickers QQQ or SPY are the big ones that pay a dividend. OR if you prefer sectoral ETFs there are others like tickers VIS (industrial sector) or technology ones or gaming theres so many! Thats another thread on it's own. If your not sure on how Expense Ratios for ETFs work or would like just say so here and I'll explain. As well as take a look at the holdings tab to see what the ETFs hold in them. (under yahoo finance - Holdings tab). Let me know what you need help with.

536,MSCI, ETFs on large indexes such as the MSCI WORLD or ACWI everything else is going more towards speculation. Just don’t buy single stocks if you cannot read a balance sheet or know basic economics. Just keep going and invest steady over some time. Paying down debt as well as avoiding it should be however your first priority. So you might get a safety deposit of 3-6 monthly income if you don’t have it already.,Striking-Help-8132,1,/r/stocks/comments/nxlv6e/best_approach_to_get_started_in_investing/h1fpa8b/,0.063,0.874,0.063,0.0
537,CHNG," Thanks for replying. It’s tricky, I guess many retail investors don’t even know their shares have been loaned, interest is usually an annualized rate whereas a dividend can be anything and anytime. Like RKT paid a $1.10 dividend, that was 6% instantaneously.  I wonder if there were investors who thought they were getting the dividend and didn’t because their shares had been loaned out. How about with CHNG, their SI is down from I think as high as 15% to about 6%, do the short sellers have to deliver the shares, or can they just pay the per share price, what if it was a split cash / acquirer share deal? Sounds messy and I wonder how well this is all accounted for and controlled.",Significant-Elk-4625,1,/r/stocks/comments/nxjg1r/chng_short_sales_borrowed_stock/h1f85ul/,0.042,0.795,0.163,0.9325

541,PM," this is gonna be a bit tricky because since youre so close, you run the risk of pin risk

regardless, you will have to close your spread or you run the risk of pin risk unless baba shoots up to 225 or something

the time that matters is 5:30 PM EST. if baba is above 215 at market close and stays above that until 530, you're home free

if baba closes at 215 but dips to 213, your broker might force you to buy 100 shares on margin if you dont have sufficient capital and you run the risk of baba dipping like 5% next monday and undertaking a huge loss

i know from experience rh will autoclose your spread if baba stays at 213 because they dont want to deal with the hassle of pin risk

you're in an incredibly risky position right now and the only thing that'll save you is baba soaring tomorrow",thelastsubject123,2,/r/stocks/comments/nx7j97/call_spread_at_expiration_clarification/h1dfpsi/,0.114,0.791,0.095,0.1968

I love the company, but I sorta came to the idea that since it had trippled in price the previous year, it's run is over.  Just seems far fetched to expect it to grow much more in the next few years. 

Not to mention, every time I read the papers, and on reddit, and TV, everyone is screaming that tech is overvalued.
