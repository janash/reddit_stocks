1,DD," DD was abandoned in favor of blatant and egregious shilling.

It's hard to have a convo on this sub without it getting hostile real quick.

People post headlines and a few positive points and argue to death when someone offers any sort of counterpoint.",Itsboomhomie,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/p1uc28/what_happened_to_this_sub/h8gjf9b/,0.197,0.646,0.157,-0.2996

5,DD," Lol I read ur comment and agree, this sub used to be banging.  I think overall pennies had a rough couple months, but also I think most ppl on this sub got sick of people trying to pump their penny stock they were bag holding, instead of an informative play on a stock at the bottom.  An example is LGHL, I held onto that bag and dumped it around even.  Nothing but bad newa in this company, and someone kept posting how great they are, a company like that u may bag hold forev.  If ppl start posting good DD on American Pennies thay have not run yet this can come back.",SnooCalculations9259,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/p1uc28/what_happened_to_this_sub/h8ggwr5/,0.063,0.752,0.184,0.9357

11,AMC, Yolo into GME and AMC is what happened imo. Then we all got informed about the truth of Wall Street. OTC and Penny stocks are the most manipulated of all so I pulled out to help the cause.
