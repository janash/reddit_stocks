probably going to get downvoted here, but charted TA and/or indicators, etc are all out the window in regards to GME. pennants, wedges, support/resistance lines, macd, rsi, ichimoku... no... it doesn't apply here. they work pretty well on low IV stocks (namely high market cap), but we're talking about the complete opposite with GME. price action is based on investor psychology/sentiment, which is bullish in the case of GME (how strong? I can't be absolutely certain... but you are all completely badass centurions for holding on).

imo, safest route to determine where GME is headed is from data (WSB, buy/sell amounts, SI, daily volume, etc). target price is something people have to figure out themselves... you need to think about making a profitable and realistic exit (I cringe at loss porn). there are plenty of folks here that post quality shit regarding the data on GME, look into them, but always DYOR.

But I wasn‚Äôt really surprised. Her impromptu twitch stream right around the mayhem because of the trade restrictions late January already gave me the feeling that unless her supporters call her attention and explain wtf is up and to focus on one issue at a time, this is expectedly going nowhere.

In her stream, she had a guest (Alexis Goldstein) derailing from the issue by talking about some wishful thinking of having the brainiacs behind the wall street softwares instead working on solving climate change.

That‚Äôs pretty much what happened during the hearing, where it‚Äôs like a bunch of people with short attention span getting distracted by different shit, that‚Äôll lead to nothing.

The math that I am talking about is looking at the short positions currently changing and moving up the ladder. 

Yesterday I checked on investopedia there were almost 90k put options between $23 to 27 value.  today they are barely above. 

All those shorts closed it a loss and went somewhere to nullify their losses......can you think of a underdog stock which suddenly rose to fame...Yes motherfuckin Rocket corp. 

There will be new short positions coming too but they are not betting unrealistically and much closer to near the trading value of GME.

221,GME," Hi all,

ADHD on medication who loves numbers and game theory here. This is not financial advice.

Many of you all are expecting an immediate squeeze. This will most likely not be the case. The hedge funds are smarter and will have learned their mistakes from the previous squeeze last month. Instead, they will elongate the squeeze and hope that we eventually lose interest.

What does this mean?

The squeeze is currently happening. As long as certain checkpoints are hit each week, the squeeze will continue to squeeze.

We saw this last week as we broke certain price thresholds. These thresholds had a ton of options ITM that results in shares that need to be bought. These bought shares pushed the stock price to its current level. Passing through thresholds each week means that the stock price will ""Level Up"" until the shorts are out.

What are the thresholds this weeks?

[As you can see here](http://puu.sh/HlNeJ/3780f377f8.png) , there are thousands of options contracts between 115 and 150. 

If we hit $145 EOW, 9930 contracts equaling 993,000 must be bought. If we hit $150, an additional 567,000 shares must be bought. If we hit 200, 681,000 more shares must be bought.

For this stock to ""Level Up"", GME needs to hit at least $145 EOW. If it hits 150 or 200, it will only accelerate the process.

Every week, the hedge funds will do whatever they can to stop the stock from hitting these thresholds. If Gamestop misses a threshold, the squeeze will be delayed. If it misses enough thresholds, the squeeze is done.

Please dissect and tell me what's wrong with my logic.",Corno4825,651,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwtejk/gme_megathread_for_march_3rd_2021/gpj2kz6/,0.064,0.842,0.095,0.8504

If they lower the price under $100, apes will throw feces (money) at the stock. Once they have the shares, they won't let go. This is bad for them.

But if they let the price go higher, they'll get hurt, and might trigger a squeeze.

240,GME," oversimplified ELI5 explanation

Hedge funds thought the stock would go down. They BORROWED shares (paying rent every day), and sold them at say $10. Now the price is going up, and they need to buy at much higher prices, say $100, incurring a $90 loss (-900% return), in order to return the shares to where they borrowed them. They are using all the influence they have to make this stock go down, but apes are still holding. HFs pay rent every day (which is very expensive for several reasons), so at a certain point they will have to decide to cut their losses, buy shares in order to return them from where they borrowed them. Buying the shares will increase the share price, which will force other shorters to do the same, driving the price to insane heights, rather fast. This is what you call a short squeeze. It is very likely to occur since there are A LOT of short sellers, I‚Äôve heard speculations between 30% and much higher than 140%; any of these numbers has the potential to turn this into the greatest short squeeze in history, a nyse supernova if you will.

This is not financial advice, but it may be worth buying whatever small amount of GME shares you can afford to lose, and enjoy the ride/show. It‚Äôs important for the amount you invest to be affordable, so that you can confidently resist all types of legal and illegal attacks from HFs and media.

I turn on the TV to check the value of the GMED (GameStop Dollar, the new global currency after the Great Squeeze of 2021) and find it has risen 1% overnight -- $12055 per share, not bad. The ongoing court case against the market manipulators looks like it will soon resolve in our favour; it's frustrating it has taken this long, but nobody said justice was quick.

After finishing a delicious bowl of Nintendo Cereal System, which was brought back into GameStop shelves in 2029 to celebrate its 40th anniversary, I put on my shoes and coat to head to work.

As I open my garage, I am greeted by my Lambo, custom plate ""GME21"", its yellow paint glimmering in the light. No matter how many times I sit behind the wheel of this beautiful machine, it somehow never gets old. I hope it never does.

Feeling in a particularly good mood, I am driven to work with the power of Blackberry's latest EV technology along the freshly constructed moon highway to the sea of tranquility, where my workplace, GameStop MegaTower #4 is located. After their market cap reached $1 trillion, it didn't take long for GameStop to expand into every industry imaginable -- and some that were even beyond our imagination. 

After a fulfilling morning trading $GME and GMED on the integalactic market, I decide to take the hyperloop to my favourite lunar restaurant for lunch. Jim Cramer takes my order, looking a little dishevelled but otherwise relieved to have found a job somewhere to help pay off his debts. I exchange 0.00019 $GME for a plate of tendies with ketchup. It was delicious.

I decide to take the afternoon off from work, as working is not a necessity for those who had diamond hands pre-squeeze. I stop off at GameStop on the way home to pick up the PS6 Slim and Nintendo Switch 2 XL, which I look forward to playing in the evening.

As I sit in my living room enjoying my games, I sit back and wonder how life would have been so much different if I hadn't held with diamond hands. Through dips and spikes. What WallStreetBets and the internet community managed to pull off was the greatest wealth transfer in history, and life was never the same again. I shudder at the thought of a world where I had taken profits at $1,000 -- I would have enjoyed a nice holiday, sure, but those pleasures come-and-go. Only by holding were we able to change the world forever, to change the world into a fairer and brighter place.

320,GME," A slow ride to the moon is a good thing for us. It builds confidence in the stock for long term buy in, unlike fast run ups that dump just as fast as they gain. If you still believe in GME, my advice is this:  

1) Keep cash available at all times for opportunistic buys.  
  
2) Provide an income stream to your securities if you can. For example, I have 2% of my pay automatically withheld and deposited to my investment account every two weeks. This is my savings and cash. It will be used for any buy opportunity that comes around.  
  
3) Average down as much as possible. Look for significant price drops that are much lower than your current average.  
  
4) Do your own research. Have you reviewed GME's most recent 10K filing? Is Ryan Cohen really on the board? Did the CFO really get ousted? Is the company at risk of bankruptcy? Ect...  
  
4) Averaging down might not be possible if your securities keep trending up in the long term. This is great for you! You might have to average up in this case. You can still spot the lows and buy the dips.  
  
5) Securities have an unlimited upside and they never expire. Don't be afraid to hold through blood days, weeks, or even months, unless it's a shit security to begin with. When the S&P 500 crashed last March, I didn't sell, but instead, I dumped my $10k cash reserve into it and made $10k profit. My ETF holding has completely recovered since then, and I am glad I didn't pull out like everyone else.  

Good luck, and may your pockets be lined with sweet, sweet tendies.  

I also like this stock, but don't blindly take my word for it, do your own DD!

376,SI," Ok apebros, Rapid fire breakdown of how this works and what you should be looking for:

FINRA, a US government backed non-for-profit, reports SI% on stocks on a regular cadence. The numbers are calculated and provided to investment agencies/firms, which are cascaded to the public. It's my understanding that the raw data is provided, so some agencies provide different SI%.

FINRA SI Reporting Schedule

[https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest)

Next time numbers get to the public is 3/9. That means we'll find out if the short is still on (more than likely is - in fact, there are still firms shorting the stock even now, betting that we won't continue to hold long enough for them to get executed).

You find out about if the short is still on by visiting multiple credible sites, and making your own judgement about what the SI% is based on the firms findings.

[https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)

[https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0](https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0)

There are others. If someone posts them in the comments I'll add them to my larger post I'm putting together with all this info.

Right now, based on the average of these 2 sites, we have about a 40-50% Short %. This is how we will end commanding the price, as long as we hold. When they come to collect these shares, and they must be collected, they will have to buy the shares from us, at whatever price we've set.

Now they could short their short, in order to buy themselves more time. But that also gives US more time to accumulate real shares. So again, a few weeks later when they calls come up, they must again pay us, or short their short, that they'd already shorted. This would be reflected in the SI% going above 100%.

If the SI% has increased when posted on 3/9, they short is more than on, it's thriving, HOLD. If it's the same, HOLD. If it's < 20% on every site, things get real questionable.

SI% gets updated every 2 weeks. Those are the big landmarks. And each Friday, calls are executed, which is when shorts may start collecting shares, in order to payout. I believe they have until Tuesday to fully pay out all executed shares.

At the moment, we're doing great. And since it's not a key day, the shorters aren't buying yet, trying to buy themselves as much time as possible before they MUST collect. So a flat day is totally normal. Tomorrow will likely be very similar. We may even see a dip. Anything < $120 is a discount. At 45% SI, all seriousness, $500 is not a meme. And it could certainly go WAY higher, if we all held together.

This is basically how it works, I think. There are people way smarter than me here, and I wouldn't be surprised if I was off on a few things. I'm not an advisor; this isn't financial advice. Just a dumb ape who wrote this up as a comment to someone who asked how this works and wanted to share. Let's build on this post together and keep it circulating.

427,DD," You are all my favorite tardfartz and you always will be. I believe whole heartedly that this is a real once in a lifetime opportunity, but that its success hinges completely on us and no one else.

Having said that, I keep seeing people speculate very specific things like ‚Äútoday is the day‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs about to happen‚Äù ‚Äúthe power-hour is gunna be fukin insane today‚Äù etc. this is not DD. This people who haven‚Äôt jerked off yet that day.

I‚Äôm all about the hype, because I think the hype is what is keeping us strong, but the ‚Äúhype‚Äù can actually damage the ‚Äúhype‚Äù over time if we (or shills, bots, or FUDders) keep hyping specific dates and numbers. 

Simply put: apes being told they‚Äôll get 10 bananas by the end of the day for 2 months straight will start to lose faith and rely on mealworms (RKT) over time if they don‚Äôt get them.

We are on the perfect trajectory. Take a beat and enjoy the ride.

Don‚Äôt become desensitized. Stay hyped/stay the course and be patient brothers and sisters. Again; WE are the biggest variable so WE have to collectively manage the psychology of this endeavor.

Not financial advice. I‚Äôm the son of an ape who may or may not be my dad and/or my dads wife‚Äôs boyfriend.

634,RKT," RKT:  A $1billion repurchase will take 29.4 million share off the board. That‚Äôs more than 25% of share that will no longer be available for trade.   Simple monkey math suggests 25% upside from $34 would add $8.5 to the share price.  That‚Äôs a fair value of $42.50 when considering just the buy back. Then, add $1.11/share special dividend, reinvested would add about 3% in total shares.  That equals a total of 44.75 fair market value just on the special incentives RKT is providing.  

In addition, if you consider record profits doubled you, I think top end RKT is $75-80.  Conservative estimate $55-65.

Yes, people have posted gains and others have claimed gains, but that is like people in 2005 making a profit off of flipping houses and trying to sell the same idea to someone in 2007.  

&#x200B;

Keep in mind, I am happy for people that got gains, but I do find it suspect.

Is it undervalued?  Yes it is.  Is it way undervalued?  Yes it is.  IMO it should be 80-100 per.

People are all over the place for why they are hoping in though.  You have FOMO, which really not close to what we saw before.  They are not a struggling Brick and Mortar.  You have people that are shouting it will go over 1k.  You have people that are saying they are just in it for the Dividend.  

&#x200B;

I enjoy a good ride up, but realistically people should invest with caution and people should not be blatantly be telling people that this is the last time you will see the price under a specific price.  This is a casino and everyone is out for themselves, but even the Casino will step in if things look suspect.

Robinhood, the online brokerage used by many retail traders to pile in to heavily shorted stocks like GameStop Corp, has made an **ambitious push into loaning out its clients' shares to short sellers as it expands its business**.

The broker had $1.9 billion in shares loaned out as of Dec. 31, nearly three times the $674 million a year earlier, and it was permitted to lend out $4.6 billion worth of securities under margin agreements, around five times bigger than the prior year, according to an annual regulatory filing late on Monday.

The size of the jump highlights Robinhood's rapid growth over the past year as the number of retail investors has soared in the work-from-home environment during the pandemic and as retail brokers have largely eliminated trading fees, a model Robinhood helped pioneer.

Menlo Park, California-based Robinhood is expected to go public this year with a valuation of more than $20 billion.

Securities lending is common among brokerages, which can earn income by lending shares to hedge funds and others, who then sell the shares back into the market, betting the share prices will drop so they can buy them back at a lower price when it is time to return them, pocketing the difference.

Shares that are in heavy demand from short sellers, like GameStop, which had 140% short interest in January, command the biggest premium from the lender.

What makes Robinhood notable is that many of the stocks its users invest in are among the most sought-after by people who want to bet against them, said one senior financial executive involved with hedge funds.

It was unclear how great a benefit the securities lending was to Robinhood's revenue and income, which it does not disclose.

Robinhood declined to comment.

The brokerage does not allow short selling on its platform.

In January, retail investors coordinated through trading forums on social media in an attempt to punish hedge funds by buying up shares of GameStop and other heavily shorted names, like AMC Entertainment, driving up their prices and forcing short sellers to close out positions at big losses.

On Jan. 28, at the height of the retail trading mania, Robinhood, along with several other brokers, restricted the buying of GameStop and other so-called meme stocks due to a massive spike in collateral requirements needed to clear the trades, angering many of its customers.

On Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden's pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission promised a thorough review of issues raised by the GameStop saga, as well as other issues related to retail brokers and investors.

The trading restrictions had already sparked congressional hearings, regulatory probes and placed greater scrutiny on short selling.

In response, Vlad Tenev, Robinhood's chief executive officer, called for shorter stock settlement times, which would reduce clearing collateral requirements.

He also said the idea that more shares of a stock can be shorted than there are available to trade, as was the case with GameStop, is a ""pathology"" that could destabilize the financial markets.

Robinhood positioned itself for growth in securities lending in October 2018 by launching its own clearing broker, which acts as a go-between with the clearinghouse that settles its trades, and allows it to hold its customers' assets. The broker can then lend out securities its customers buy on margin.

At present, less than 3% of Robinhood's funded accounts are margin-enabled, Tenev recently told Congress.",brooklynlad,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwj6cw/whos_shorting_this_with_me_fuck_vlad/gpiilw6/,0.035,0.841,0.124,0.992

1069,GME," This is great, but I certainly think you need to add in the fact there‚Äôs a direct deposit stimulus check coming March 22. 

This isn‚Äôt financial advice and I‚Äôm genuinely retarded, but ~300M people are going to get $800-1,400 deposited into their bank accounts in 3 weeks. While this will help a ton of people in need, it‚Äôll also provide disposable income for ~100M people. Figure 1% of that 100M YOLO‚Äôs it in GME, that‚Äôs at least a billion dollar cash infusion. Heck, I bet minimum ~500K people who are getting a stimulus are probably already invested. There‚Äôs been a jump of 10M members on WSB alone. 

Who knows how this all plays out, but it certainly seems we‚Äôre setting up for a black swan event due to two completely separate economic unicorns. If anything, the last few days have been shockingly steady. It feels more like Dec. early Jan then it does end of Jan. 

Given everything above, if GME stays around 120 because people like the stock and see the potential, we‚Äôre pushing out failure to deliver days and building momentum. GME will stay in the forefront BECAUSE it‚Äôs THE meme stonk and excitement/speculation will build as we get closer to the checks. 

Best case scenario hedgeies are at the end of their failure to deliver leash as stimmies get released and the $Billion+ infusion creates the perfect storm. 

Worst case the hedgies realize this is coming and just decide to pull the plug now and do damage control so GME has lost its luster before the gov splashes 1.9 Trillion in our economy.

1085,RKT," I don‚Äôt think RKT is a purposely crafted distraction, just a coincidence. The company had their IPO a few months ago and after gaining value for a couple weeks it crashed, and since then has drawn a few hedge funds who have spent the last few months shorting it. However, it has backfired on the shorts for a few reasons, the biggest being that RKT‚Äôs execs aren‚Äôt fucking around and have decided to actively fuck over the shorts. In late November, RKT announced they intend to do a massive stock buy back of $1 billion worth of shares during Q1. This has yet to happen so it‚Äôs likely to occur in the very near future; current float is about 100M, so they intend to buyback roughly 25% of all outstanding stock. Then, during their Q4 earnings report on 2/25, they announced a special dividend of $1.1/share is going to be paid out to all holders at the end of market 3/9. On top of that, the shorts got noticed by the retail investors, having overplayed their hand again and irresponsibly pushed to 40% short interest. So now the shorts are stuck in a shitty position. If they don‚Äôt settle up their positions by 3/9, they‚Äôll wind up having to cover that dividend, and on top of that retail is buying the stock up like crazy. Bonus, RKT is roughly 70% institutional ownership, and those firms are more than happy to throw fuel on the fire to burn their competitors attempting to short them.",Captain_Sacktap,120,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwgbtr/gme_please_read/gphn6uv/,0.059,0.803,0.137,0.9616

1087,GME," Be careful in here. There's a lot of confirmation bias on this sub-reddit. Some of these people have even tried to say that walking into a Gamestop and getting paid $5 for something you spent $60 on - when that meant something - was a good customer experience. Be about the money. Watch the money, trust nobody. I wasn't in the military but I am certain this is nothing like organized combat would be.

Some people in this subreddit made a ton of money doing things that would have lost them everything in a slightly weaker market. The whole thing can go tits up anytime.

I disagree with OP on the very possibility that GME would ever go above $2000'ish. It spiked hard once. Institutional investors weren't ready for it. This time, if anyone needs to spend so much the float will suddenly be large enough to accommodate the shorts. GME will not be allowed to threaten the integrity of the market.

In the long term, supposedly GME is trying to get into digital distribution behind Epic, Valve, Microsoft, Amazon, and every other digital retailer in the world. They don't seem have the infrastructure or personnel or experience with the technology to enter this space to me. And they're going to win? Maybe they're going to finagle a way to make professional gaming a moneymaker?

After Google - **fucking GOOGLE** \- spewed out a complete shit show technologically with Stadia?

$GME is about the short term money, if you want in. But be very careful. This play may be played out; the funds shorting may have covered their shorts and immediately sold calls assuming the price would go down. Sure, they lose money if the stock doesn't drop, but it doesn't trigger the granddaddy of all squeezes. They're covered. They make one or two calls this month, the furor dies down, they stay rich.

These companies dont own your shares. The sharing of information to larger institutions is in the TOS on every brokers page from rh to webull to td ameritrade to fidelty to whatever they all do it its how they dont charge you any fees for the service by selling your data to large market insitiutions just like how google and facebook sell your data just like how youtube does its nothing new in the digital age if you want to bypass it get a conventional broker but even than the shares you buy via him are owned as much as shares sold by RH. You are just upheld to there TOS which are very limiting to retail traders and they can basicly stop trading when they please and excuse it as software issues etc if they want. You are not these companies customers you are the income the customers are the hedges firms brokers buying your information to see market trends and jot in down in there fancy analytics and find the best probability at income based off the actions of millions of users data in real time they invest hundreds of millions for this information we are the smallest fish in the pond here surrounded by sharks barracudas piranhas etc and we are simple goldfish.,fman1854,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwrnb7/webull_dont_let_them_loan_your_shares_turn_off/gpkczwc/,0.033,0.854,0.113,0.9716

Every good trade, every time a ticker pops off, it is because of institutional power and pressure and market conditions. When people make money off of these things, it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre riding that train, not conducting it. 

HOLY SHIT I wish people over in the GME thread would understand this. So many ""What's going on why is the volume so low"" and ""if enough of us buy in the dips we'll cause it to spike!"".

If you believe that the short percentages are still astronomical, if you believe the situation has not changed or even gotten more prolific, then you also must understand that the vast majority of shares are in the possession if high profile backers, hedges and other large institutions.

Also, aside from his beautiful wrinkly brain, the #1 reason for DFV's success (and Michael Burry's in That Movie, for that matter) is that he had conviction in his DD and he was **patient.**  If *those* geniuses weren't able to pick out a specific date (and, in fact, were way too early and were ostensibly losing money for a long time), why would you think that a random redditor can?

1361,GME," I've been looking in to this. I'm new to stocks, already lost a few k from being a moron but have since learned a lot. I doubt GME will go to 800$ but the risk is worth it. I don't have the funds to buy 100 GME @ 120 and all the rules and regulations are still murky(PDT, GFV, etc). But it's so cheap and the upside is so tremendous it's worth the bet... but I just have to figure out how to actually make money on it if it were to happen because I doubt it would stay ITM long enough for me to figure out what the hell I need to do to get that $$$ without the cash on hand to by 12k and then sell quick enough. I'm still not 100% sure this is not a huge pump and dump to scam retailers ;/ Either way the HF's are doing an amazing job with their propaganda. If the Bull thesis is actually true, and it seems that way from my limited knowledge(which might have just left me holding the bag) then too the moon! I don't see how the hell it can come back down. GME is then in a positive feedback loop and the only way the HF's(or retail if it is a scam) can not be decimated is to cut their loses of billions and get the h ell out of dodge(or have the tax payers bail them out again).

If only I entered in a few months sooner I'd be sitting pretty and have most of this shit worked out, I got in on the tail end of the last squeeze not having a clue about the markets or what was actually going on make a quick 100$ in a few minutes then lost 2k over the next month because of psychological manipulation/weakness.",EternalDissonance,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lweje6/keep_your_eyes_on_the_volume_behind_the_movement/gpj6m08/,0.166,0.757,0.077,-0.9833

Can we make the default search result for WSB newbies a ""no-meme"" zone?

They enter WSB, and they get some hint of the memes of what us retards can give. If we were to just keep handling the situation by mass-spamming memes (and I understand that we CAN remove the memes from OUR searches), people are going to think we don't provide anything BUT a cult of reeetards, when in reality, we're actually WAY smarter than what we think.

I personally want everyone to feel included, not throughout memes, but throughout the knowledge.

1) get enough sleep. The market will move, it is not under your control, so sleep at least 6 hours per 24hrs.

2) hydrate. Drink water, or sports drinks, milk etc... staying hydrated keeps the brain functioning. Also you will be less likely to cramp up while you are craning your neck to keep a constant eye on your stonks.

3) if nothing works to calm your nerves, get high. Cannabis is pretty safe, but maybe your doctor can recommend something that has easier dosage control. But....STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM AMBIEN!",G_yebba,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwoys5/something_isnt_right/gpkuigb/,0.083,0.805,0.112,0.5336

IF WE'RE SAYING TO **THE MOON** ETC (As for me, I'm thinking more ***intergalactic travel***)

THIS STUFF IS LIKE ***TRILLIONS OF LIGHT YEARS AWAY***

LETS BE ON OUR:

STAR TREK

STAR WARS

ETC

BUY HODOR

**FOR THE SQUEEZE:**

***Limit Sell Order: $999,999.99***

As of now we‚Äôre all familiar with this GME ride throughout the intergalactic galaxy.

If you‚Äôre unable to set limit sell orders for $999,999.99 (the highest that my broker Merrill allows) then wait closer to the squeeze to set higher limits.

If you‚Äôre concerned about your broker borrowing your shares, then opt out of the lending program or make your account a cash account and not a margin account.

Despite holding positions in GME at Robinhood, at this point, everyone should have switched their remaining funds out of Robinhood into different brokerages.

Continue to BUY and HODOR (if you like the stock) so that GME gets to infinity and beyond, which is the best price for all of us!

$999,999.99

Let‚Äôs ALL get THE BEST PRICE!

1967,DD," I know I‚Äôm not a special little star, but I have also been a part of this community for a long time. I have had multiple Reddit accounts so my account page does not reflect it, but have been around since before the *WSB God* ordeal. Just started investing once I finally got out of debt and came to the conclusion that losing money would not negatively affect me.

That being said, I must say that people seem to be blind to the fact that a **7 million** user gain in **any** community within a short period of time Will of course bring with it some Baggins, especially a community that is solely focused on the acquisition of money. When money gets involved, things are messy. When the idea of major amount of free money and literally millions of people get involved all within a very short period of time, things get pretty fucky. 

There are actually websites in businesses that are now built around the monitoring of this community. People with millions of dollars in billions of dollars with big power or now watching this with the intent of exploiting it. Just think of how easy it is to hire say 50,000 bots that go unnoticed in a monumental number like 9 million. Do people seriously think that things are not being manipulated?

Especially with the fact that the entire feel of the sub has changed, I don‚Äôt know, I just feel like something is off. I cannot tell you how many ‚Äúabsolutely certain predictions‚Äú have been made with pages full of research that say X stock (GME) or some other is going ‚Äúto the mooooooon‚Äù. Do you fucking retards actually think that GameStop is going to hit $100,000 a share? $10,000 a share? Be serious. That is fucking moronic. Lots of people are spewing this shit seriously and lots of people are also buying it up.

**I‚Äôve said this before and I seem to get down voted, but I don‚Äôt really care. This sub should reset it‚Äôs users back to people who have subscribed before February 1, and then go private.** 

That will at least help with the majority of things and get things back to normal. What benefit is there to have 9 million subscribers? What about 5 million? Honestly, some of the best DD and research that I have seen is being done in other established sub Reddit‚Äòs that are similar to Wall Street bats but with a much lower subscriber count. I will not name them, because I also don‚Äôt want them to blow up like this one has and become ruined.

1970,RKT," WSB has never ever been a collective, or about a cause. It is a bunch of individuals, expressing their belief of their own stock.

The idea that RKT is a bad play, and is contrived, is a joke. You're a joke. This subreddit is a GME cult. And its a joke. A company whos stock was at 22.80 at the opening on Monday, after announcing that they would be paying a 1.10 dividend to the share holders at close of market on the 9th of January (5% of share value) IS A SURE THING. They smashed earnings too.

The old guard of WSB came in with RKT in their hands, kicking and screaming and letting all the smooth brained apes that they can make a killing on RKT if they just get in and get out. BUT NO. ITS CONTRIVED. YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY MAKE MONEY UNLESS ITS GAMESTOP. I NEED TO HOLD MY BAGS, BECAUSE IF I SELL AT A LOSS, IM A WEAK. OTHER PLAYS IMPOSSIBLE. GME STRONG. MAKE MONEY DUMB. RED GOOD. GREEN BAD. OHH AAAA AAA üêí

I'm not saying that they won't go to the stratosphere or beyond, I'm just asking why people are always informing us of an upcoming rocket mid launch? 

When you know they are loading the rocket and see them make launch preparations THIS is the time to DD, not after they have started the jets ...

I was thinking the same thing about that. But I feel the squeeze has started with RKT and think it would be far more profitable to pull out earlier. Either it started yesterday or today, but it's important to note that every squeeze would last about three days (I could be extremely wrong on that, that's what I notice from all historical squeezes)...

And I see AMC coming up next and it should be bigger than the first squeeze by at least x2 amount. Followed by GME (forecasts state on the 19th) which should be the mother all squeezes. They are both following the 08' volkswagen squeeze pretty decently, and looking at the three month period we have a beautiful cup and handle for both of em'.

Normally squeezes last about three days (what I've noticed).

2616,VERY," First thing you should know is calls are the right not obligation to buy 100 shares at the strike price. The strike is the price u are betting on happening, so 100C means Call- at 100 strike price. 

Second- it costs money to buy this right, that money is called the Premium. That‚Äôs the .98 or 2.50 or whatever u see next to the call option when you go to buy it. That‚Äôs the premium or charge per share, multiply by 100 to get your cost. 

So stock is $10 now. You bet it is going to be $15 by 3/5 Friday, and pay premium of $1 per 100. That looks like 3/19 15C, $1.00 premium x100, or $100 to enter that ‚Äúbet‚Äù. 

The date is what day you have until to get your bet right, or to sell your call contract

As the stock price increases and gets closer towards your target or strike price, it makes the value of the premium, the $100 go up. The $100 is the equity you have in the bet, if stock price is really close to the strike price then you will have a more valuable call. If the price goes further away from your strike, you lose your premium, until $0.

Essentially, you get in and say $RKT is gonna hit $50 by end of the week or month, if it goes up a lot, other people will pay you for the right to buy your contract which gives them the ability to buy 100 shares at the strike price. 

Also you should know that theta is decay due to time, each day you are in it- your value goes down by theta x100. Gamma and delta are important too but you should look them up once u get a better grasp of the basics.

Good luck, and remember when you BUY calls and BUY puts you can only lose 100% of your premium. 

But when you SELL calls or puts, you can lose more, especially selling calls. Be VERY careful with those.",NotMeUSa2020,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwdhgl/someone_said_to_buy_rkt_this_morning_thanks_hero/gpia5d7/,0.061,0.856,0.084,0.9078

2979,GME," What does this mean?
Key level - $160, I don't don't what is going above that level, I just know they want GME to stat bellow $160.
Look the first peak at $155 January 25th, probably when hedgies added more shorts because it went from there to $60.
January 26th Elon tweets ""Gamestonk!!"" GME skyrocket to $350 then $480. After that GME went down to $160 - $110 then went back up to $410 (JAN 28/29) they probably partially covered their new short at $160.
Then on Feb 2th GME was on $75 later that day went up to $153 then all the way down to $40
Then on Feb 25th GME went up to $183 they started working very hard to keep it bellow. They won't let go above $160
Why? There is heavy shorts around that level. They will work to death to keep bellow $160.
Hedgies are not in the business of investing. They in the business of misinformation and destroying companies. Whatever the news says don't believe it. 
GME short interest is probably in all time high now. 


TL;RD

What does this mean?
If $1k or $10k or $100k (or whatever) is the moon then $160 is the orbit.

3021,GME," Good point! It's very likely an aggregate of the ""at the close"" trades. What most people don't know is there are more trade types than you typically are offered on the discount brokerages like Fidelity, Robinhood, etc.

These trade types aren't relevant for most people. But execution traders (e.g. the trade desk at a clearing firm) makes use of various trade types. You can designate trades to execute at the close, at the open, VWAP for the day, VWAP for afternoon session, the list goes on.

I think you are likely correct about the aggregation in this case, and there could be multiple at the close trades booked to the tape if multiple market makers had at the close orders.

Another note here too, when you see a 4 million share order, more often than not that is some type of pre-negotiated trade lot of time or the market maker balancing their book (because they are obligated to do so at certain points). 

Someone trading 4 million shares in a stock like GME isn't sending out a market order and hoping they get the current price. The depth of market isn't there and that would be a ridiculous order. In fact, they aren't even placing a limit order for that many shares because anyone with level 2 quote access would see it. They are negotiating those trades either directly with the market maker who finds the otherside or someone they know personally and booking the trade to the tape themselves.",Desperate-Union-3214,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwgdpx/someone_just_bought_4821223_shares_of_amc/gpiaefm/,0.01,0.911,0.079,0.9379

I paper handed hard. I was so confident going into it.

$10.52 - 300 shares.

$10.04 - 100 shares.

$9.86 - 100 shares.

$9.75 - 100 shares.

Then it just dove to below $9.50 and I sold everything at $9.45. 

Realized an $800 loss in about 3 hours. 

It didn't do anything that I thought it would. I was level headed for a while then I got emotional and fear came in. I bought RKT at the right time and sold far too soon (Made $100). Didn't want to make the same mistake twice. I completely doubted my position. *Sigh*

I learned a lot from this experience. I usually invest and don't trade but after watching RKT and seeing the similarities.... I jumped in. 

I usually sell at 2.5 percent down and look for 7.5 percent gains (or better with stop loss behind it). 

This was way out of the norm for me. I guess I'm officially retarded.

3163,RKT," the easiest way to conceptualize option prices is probability. anything that increases the probability of an option going in the money increases the value of the option. so as the stock price approaches the strike price, as volatility increases, and if you have more time before the contract expires, these factors increase the option price. for example, stock xyz has a stock price of 100. a call option with a strike price of 101 and expires in 30 days has a very high probability of finishing above 101 in 30 days and therefore would be pretty expensive. a call option with a strike price of 120 and expires in 3 days has a very low chance of finishing above 120 in 3 days so this option would be pretty cheap.

i sold covered calls on RKT today when it was trading at 41. the strike i sold was 50 expiring on 3/19. the premium i received was 700 per contract and i sold 13 contracts so i got 9100 this morning. if RKT doesn‚Äôt finish above 50 on 3/19, i keep the shares and the premium. if it finishes over, i have to sell the shares at 50, even if the stock price is way past 50.",l0wryda,10,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwea4x/uwmc_dd_a_swing_play_value_play_and_long_term/gpiijdx/,0.041,0.86,0.099,0.9214

First of all, I thank you for your post.

**TL;DR: RKT isn't over-shorted, and RKT's adjustable rates might actually cause another housing crash**

My first concern:

Are the HF calls ITM? If they are, it's a safe bet that they are doing synthetic shorts again. Usually the ITM calls are short, paired with long puts. I'm not very smart but here's a quick article to help explain them

https://www.theoptionsguide.com/synthetic-short-stock.aspx

Now, nowhere in the link to the earlier DD do I see anything about the short interest.
I'm also blind, so forgive me if I didn't see that.

You can't squeeze the shorts if there are plenty of shares for them to buy up. In fact, it feels like something a HF would do to pull FROM GME.

I'm not saying you're wrong, but I'm having trouble convincing myself that RKT is anything but a PnD for the HFs to get the money they need to cover GME shorts.

If anyone has a link to prove that they've overshorted and unable to cover all their shorts, I'd appreciate it.

Second concern:

RKT is the parent company of Rocket Mortgages and Quicken Loans. They do Fixed, Adjustable Rate, VA, FHA, and Jumbo loans.
Their minimum credit score is 580, minimum down payment is 3% of the price of the home.

If any of this sounds familiar, it's because 550 the previous benchmark for bad loans in 2008. That extra 30 points is a credit card you only put 3 percent of the limit on and pay off each month.

The housing market collapsed when those adjustable rates rose, and Congress made it a requirement to provide an annual credit report for free (2010) to anyone who asks.

Congress didn't do that out of the goodness of their heart. It was a sacrifice to get people back to using credit to buy things.

Credit props up our market, but RKT has a company that allows those with BAD credit to secure loans, which are now called BTOs (bespoke tranche opportunity), changed from CDOs (collateralized debt obligation).

I do not think it's a great idea to invest in a company that is pulling the same shenanigans as others did in 2008.

Again, I could have this completely wrong. But I also think there's really screwy stuff going on, with Berkshire Hathaway buybacks, Burry suggesting that the USD will collapse, and the unshakeable concern that RKT is just another SLV with more experienced people pushing it here.

3287,GME," Hi stranger! First off, you bear thesis for $RKT is compelling. I don't have an answer to most of it. I personally don't know whether this company would be a good long term investment. I've seen a lot of people say it is, while you make a great point that it may very well not be!

In terms of liquidity for the shares, from what I was reading (both from other commenters and also the Board's call when they made the announcement) They're supposedly doing a Billion dollars of share buybacks in the near future. On top of this, the $1.1 special dividend they've declared is payable by both the company, and shorts on the shares they possess.

From my understanding, the idea is to use the next few days to force their backs against a wall and drive the share price higher. I don't know the exact short percentage either, but what had me buy in was the high interest rates on new shorts (happened when GME took off as well).

Not only can it lead to you becoming a bag holder, but the SEC frowns upon the ‚Äúwe talk‚Äù you mentioned in your post. I do not mean this in any rude way but everyone makes their decisions themselves and is ultimately for themselves. We are not a pack here in WSB. We are individual investors who do not coordinate in any way on a stock. 

If you see information that is scattered, like you mentioned, it is imperative to do your own research and figure out what is true and what is not. Not everyone who got in early on RKT did DD but the people who got in last week and knew about this definitely did. 

As far as UWMC goes, I have seen a few posts about it but nothing close to the amount on RKT or GME. I plan on doing my own DD on UWMC tonight before deciding to go in tomorrow morning. 

I have no positions in UWMC as of now but I am intrigued enough to do some DD and possibly get in tomorrow. 

Another major point to keep in mind, if you do get into something like RKT, make sure you have a PT in mind and do not be greedy.

It's got a 13% short float.  13%!  Those *hedgies* sure will be mad when you buy it!  Were gonna squizzle their squozzle amirite fellow apes?

Ha ha, yes!  Anyway, be sure after you buy to HODL until Noon on Friday, me and my other friends will definitely be HODLing until then as well and *not* unloading our position on Thursday.

And then, once you've gotten your tendies at noon on Friday, you can just go back to whatever other stock you like (GME was it?) and buy back the stock you sold, plus a lot more shares with all those tenders you printed!  It's called *averaging down* all the pros do it.

3380,UWMC," I likened quicken and wanted to see what the fuss eas about. So i refinanced my house when rates hit the floor and was very impressed with the portal and millennium style. Its the robinhood of home loans.  No need to even talk to someone and all loan status milestones are simple on their site. So i bought it. The uwmc was their competitor but as a wholesaler doesnt take the same risk, they offload loans to the big boys and they get away from some regulatory red tape when jpm or boa buy tranches of loans  from UWMC. Best advise is buy what you use or know and buy the buyers. Why buy nio when you can own teala?

Extensive DD, I know.

Really though, looks like people are calling in $100, $200... all the way to $800. Going the other way, looks like there are about 50% more puts than calls as of right now, with some really high clustering at $5. Does mean if people actually hold, and play this smart, there could be some really high gains if/when bears try to bail.

What about $LOTZ, $NAKD, $ESGC, and $WISH?  There is no way their floats or short interest changed so much that 1) they wouldn't be on the list and 2) that they wouldn't be prime candidates for a squeeze.

3717,RH," **DO NOT YOLO WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW THE BASICS. You would be lying to your broker anyway as you have to answer a few questions for them to even allow you to trade options, which you would probably not get right without knowing the basics.**

 I would highly recommend learning more and getting all these things figured out, before trying to trade options. The worst thing you can do for yourself is buy an option and not understand all the mechanics of it. Since you can't really ""practice"" without buying one, you'll want to be extra sure you know what you're doing before doing so. There are many videos on Youtube to answer more questions than you think you would have. I would recommend **InTheMoney** on Youtube, he has options videos for both RH and Webull. They both cover everything about options, in very deep detail, with hand drawn examples and clearly stated facts. Be warned the videos are like 2hrs long, but definitely necessary if youre going to be trying to trade options. Just take the time to do it. It took me more than a week to watch the Webull one since it was so dense, but it's why I know what I do now.

Here's some basics. A call is betting the price goes up. Put is betting it goes down. The dollar amount in the option description is called the strike price. The cost of the option is the premium, what you pay to buy the option. If an option is priced at $1.20, your total cost will actually be $120, since 1 option respresents 100 shares. That is your ""buy in"" and your maximum loss, you cannot lose anything more than that. Calls are attractive for this reason, they have a limited loss and an infinite profit, since stock prices can technically rise to infinity. The strike price and the price of the option are two totally separate things.

Broad example. $ABCD stock is currently at $20. You want to buy a call option. You choose to buy OTM (out of the money). The strike price you are looking at is $25, meaning you believe the stocks price will rise to $25 or more. The date is the timeframe that you think the stock will rise to that $25. So if you choose a $25c 3/19, it means you believe that the stock will go from $20 to $25+ BEFORE or on 3/19. If it does, then your option becomes ITM (in the money). The mid price of the option shows it is $0.33. That means the option only costs $33 to buy it. So you spend $33 to buy a OTM $25c 3/19.

 To finish the trade, **you DO NOT want to exercise**, only in very specific situations would you ever want to exercise. Exercising simply means you buy those 100 shares at the strike price you chose, since **""an option is a contract that gives you the right, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares at the strike price""** (watch the videos ;P ). Instead you will simply sell the contract back to the market the same way you bought it to close out and take your profits.

However, a cursory evaluation of the previous value of $GME to point conversion at market close would yield an approximate value of the square root of Y squared over P - (A + B) square =/= r
(Given r = realized P&L) 

If using unrealized gains (u), a different formula must be used where the absolute value of the greatest negative Integer would replace P (probablity).

Irrespective of method used, the result will be fractional and thus cannot be rounded. 

I highly recommend using #Robinhood for the ability to convert $GME/points into fractional shares.

Eventually, reality bites. For now, there is value in these bubbles - exactly what these short squeezes provide, a time-limited opportunity - but ultimately they will come back to where they ""should"" be.

Where the price ""should"" be is ultimately down to what the stock trades for, heat and pressure, that sort of thing, but I say ultimately these things find their natural level.

TSLA and a few others are where they are for different reasons - it's a cult of personality and there's some hedge value to it, apparently.

4074,RKT," I paper handed hard. I was so confident going into it. 

$11.20 - 200 shares.

$10.52 - 300 shares.

$10.04 - 100 shares.

$9.86 - 100 shares.

$9.75 - 100 shares.

Then it just dove to below $9.50 and I sold everything at $9.45. 

Realized an $800 loss in about 3 hours. 

It didn't do anything that I thought it would. I was level headed for a while then I got emotional and fear came in. I bought RKT at the right time and sold far too soon (Made $100). Didn't want to make the same mistake twice. I completely doubted my position. *Sigh*

I learned a lot from this experience. I usually invest and don't trade but after watching RKT and seeing the similarities.... I jumped in. 

I usually sell at 2.5 percent down and look for 7.5 percent gains (or better with stop loss behind it). 

This was way out of the norm for me. I guess I'm officially retarded. Especially when this jumps over $12 again after lunch.",GMEgotmehere,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwxiye/why_uwmc_can_squeeze_even_higher/gpjwpo1/,0.119,0.773,0.108,-0.4139

P.s. how in the world can throwing money at a problem that requires brainpower, time, data collection, and talent be solved when there is nowhere to throw that money at? Elon spoke about this, he has money.. Tesla has Billions they could literally throw at anything that will help their cause. There is no magical university that's printing out top tier electrical/design/power train/CPU/AI/solar/Battery/manufacturing/material science etc etc.. The team at Tesla and extension SpaceX have been searching the world for the best talent in every field for over a decade.. While everyone you listed was still looking for a combustion engine specialist, gas, oil, transmissions, etc they were drawing in all the new and upcoming talents in those respective fields. To say anyone will truly be Tesla competition at this point is almost laughable. Some will make it, some will have victories over Tesla in some categories... But by the time the first car maker (besides Tesla) can make a car comparable to the 2012 model S... Tesla will be building for 2030 or 2050 for that matter.. The best Fastest manufacturing in the world, the recipe to create the machine that prints the machine, FSD functioning ai that saves more lives than seat belts and airbags combined, best battery tech (not in a lab) in the world, material science 10+ years ahead of other auto..

The future of Earth and humanity is literally being held hostage by cultists who worship a single entity and all that it stands for, it is incredibly how you can fish in people and cage their mindsets with just being a very funny holesum 69 man and caressing their feelings (memes).

It is bad enough that you begin with positing the trainwreck that is the biggest automakers in the world is going to succumb or go bankrupt to a company that can‚Äôt even make a profit on cars and are barely making a dent on the market share. Then you go on to ramble about Tesla being some kind of scientific utopia where all the world‚Äôs discoveries and innovations are being concocted and we will all now down to Le Musk and his ultra-mega revolutionzing cars that literally beats everything else in the history of innovation and discoveries. You were so devoid of rational thought that your brain turned into a mush and you forgot that competition exists, which if you didn‚Äôt know is a backbone for bettet consumer products because it forces competitors to improvise. But apparently in your fantasy world competition no longer exists and Tesla has literally unrealised monopoly on survival of humanity.

Hey, did you know that there was a world before Tesla and Musk? Did you know that many differents kinds of groundbreaking technological and scientific discoveries have been made and improved upon in the last 100 years? In case you didn‚Äôt remember, humanity existed, and thrived long before Tesla, incredible right?

Also, no, FSD does not save more than seatbelts and airbags combined, that is just a projection, and seems like a downplay on their importance on your part for the sake of sucking off. Also, no again, FSD is not even level 5 autonomous and still in the beta stage, and Waymo already seems to be having the edge, funny how that works.

But yes, the company that made more money trading Bitch¬©Ô∏èoin than selling cars recently and as such directly supported the pollution of the Earth despite preaching about the environment, is going to take down the big players that have been in the industry for decades and actually have cash reserves to, you know, spend on R&D.

I work in the car world (mid level at a dealer but I take every opportunity to talk the the corporate guys and learn everything I can behind the scenes).  A few major points 1) a massive amount of Tesla‚Äôs value comes from the assumption it will achieve self driving and that tech will be worth trillions.  I am confident this is impossible. Having talked directly to engineers working on self driving, it‚Äôs an open secret in the industry that Tesla‚Äôs self driving program is a sham. Literally not a single other company is using a camera and radar based system in their self driving program. Everyone from dedicated autonomous vehicle tech companies to Toyota, to GM, to VW is using a system that requires massively more expensive sensor equipment, namely LiDAR. I can go into a million reasons why this is the case, but when it becomes clear that Tesla has been misleadingly advertising a decent driver assist package as self driving and that they are no where close to true autonomy that will be a MASSIVE blow. They are already losing lawsuits in the EU forcing them to stop calling it ‚Äúautopilot‚Äù. 2) recalls are a HUGE deal in the auto industry and can crush profits and quickly drive away customers. There have already been some pretty serious issues stemming from their notorious build quality that would never occur with a traditional manufacturer at the scale they have for Tesla. The worst being suspensions that aren‚Äôt bolted together correctly causing the front driver strut to collapse and car to spontaneously spin out. You can‚Äôt have the worst build quality around for as long as they have and not eventually have a massive safety scandal. 3) R&D.

Toyota alone sinks over a million into R&D every hour of every day, VW is even bigger.

4148,GM," Yea I basically said this in another comment, but just something more simple. I recognized that other manufactures have been going heavy into EV, GM being one of them and having made like 4 billion in a single quarter of 2020 and that alone being 5 times Teslas 2020 entire profit. And they are pushing to go completely Elelectric. I simply mean he likes to go bigger. He will eventually expand Tesla.  Its not going to stay at 500,000 car a year manufacturer forever. To be fair, 500k in 2020 is still pretty good for their size and being that most of the US doesnt even have charging stations yet. Obviously not as big as 100 year old car manufacturers, but they pushed in the right direction while everyone else refused. 

As far as the self driving. Have cops not literally found people drunk in their Teslas after the car pulls them over, or people being filmed asleep at the wheel in Teslas? It might not be as advanced as they say, companies over exaggerate all the time. But they are definitely, again, pushing in the direction that most auto makers kind of refused to do for a while.",Dougdluxx,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwgrpk/we_in_dis_together_daddy_musky/gphjfyv/,0.069,0.802,0.129,0.945

Did you somehow pile them all up and label them as the same entity?

2. Carbon credits is a dying business. Also, nobody is paying their competition to give them a heads up, do you even know what competition and business is? Here is a crazy example that might melt your brain: [Apple has paid Samsung millions](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/04/apple-iphone-8-oled-display-samsung.html) for their OLED screens, netting their biggest competitor profit, and guess what? They are both THRIVING with huge market shares! And to the surprise of no one (again), segertal other industries do this. You really thought you had some gotcha moment there where Tesla, the almighty savior of humanity had done something revolutionizing on profits?

Edit: And on the matter of Apple vs Samsung, pretty fitting that [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-03/vw-s-electric-car-stacks-up-well-against-tesla-in-ubs-teardown) landed on my feed right after I replied to you.

4150,GM," Driver assist features are pretty much standard equipment these days. Even a base model corolla can steer to keep you in the lane, slow down to a full stop to avoid rear-ending someone ect. Highway driving is relatively easy to fake 95% of the time. The tesla system is different from the other slightly more advanced stuff like GM's super cruise in that it is dangerously generous with driver negligence. For example, all of the direct competitors like GM super cruise monitor the driver as well as the road. Most have sensors facing the driver that can detect if their eyes leave the road and will pull the car over or turn off the system and sound an alarm. Even the lower level stuff like that from Toyota or Honda turns off the system if it detects that the driver isn't turning the wheel along with the system. The Tesla system largely lacks those kinds of safeguards. Basically, the same basic functionality and tech exists even in cars a fraction the price, but Tesla allows driver's to abuse their system in such a way that gives the illusion of greater autonomy than their competitors. I've seen at lease one person who used an open source software hack on a 2018 Camry with the factory 360 degree camera setup to mimic the same features, and have heard directly from at least one engineer working on a driver assistance system at a major manufacturer that they all don't enable all the things the system is capable of because they know it is not safe. The real challenges of self-driving are massive, largely clustered in non-freeway scenarios, and are not going to be solved in the next few years with some clever programing/machine learning for existing hardware. It will require vehicles fundamentally different that what is on the road now with equipment that would currently put it far out of the price range of even most luxury shoppers.",pattythebigreddog,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwgrpk/we_in_dis_together_daddy_musky/gphq5pw/,0.059,0.84,0.101,0.8908

4183,GME," I have my GME tale in my comment history.

I put in $3k (+$200 in brokerage fees) into $34c OTMs on Friday @0.10 each when the ask/bid was 0.11/0.09. I sold them when the stock price was teetering steadily in the $37 range on market order. I still believed it would go up, but fear got the best of me in continuing to hold. Actually shot up from $37-$40 less than 10 seconds after selling, missing an extra $100k.

Last Tuesday, when GME was hovering around $44, I started checking up on it after not thinking about it since the beginning of February. I had a hypothesis, and if I took the actions that I planned to take based on that hypothesis, I could have gained $2.5 million from $3000 (though I didn‚Äôt believe it would be that much gain, I thought I‚Äôd gain around $600k, but there were some other factors that multiplied that 4-fold). I was going to buy $3,000 worth of weekly calls on the following Wednesday morning (Same day it skyrocketed due to gamma hedging). However, instead of going through with it, I instead wanted to use this event to verify whether my thoughts were in the right direction or not and give confidence, and act on my next thoughts. It‚Äôs pretty painful looking at it now, but seeing how that did pan out well (other than the fact that I wasn‚Äôt in it), that‚Äôs what led me to doing this YOLO this time. Buy low and sell high is the way, right? Or buy high and hold.

Cannot tell if I am an idiot or an idiot. I will probably lose this all YOLOing in RKT shares tomorrow morning. Or be too chicken to do it. Or lose it all. Actually, I‚Äôll probably lose it all on GME again.

When he bought this call option he did a BUY TO OPEN on the call for a bullish position. 

To get rid of his call contract and collect the option premium gain, he needs to SELL TO CLOSE his call contract. 

When you ‚Äúsell a call‚Äù option you SELL TO OPEN a call contract. Selling an option is also referred to as ‚Äúwriting‚Äù. You‚Äôre selling/writing it to someone who is buying a call, like the guy above, who is bullish. Selling/writing that call is a bearish position.
