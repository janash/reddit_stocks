I thought they were the Pepsi of intel(Intel was coke) at the time.  They were in my Playstation/Xbox and PC so I thought they weren't going anywhere.

114,GOEV," I have a speculative play on GOEV. This isn't a short-term play but recent hires by the company lead me to believe this company is legit and will find a foothold somewhere (not sure where yet). This coupled with the technology (it is pretty sweet) and EV mandates there is, in my opinion, some potential here.

Price matching AMZN, with same day delivery utilizing all of their brick and mortar stores as mini distribution centers.  
  
Opening up two new huge distro centers on both sides of the county to facilitate their growth into an ecommerce contender.  
  
Their ecommerce footprint has also grown, now selling a variety of things from TV's, cameras, computers and computer hardware/accessories, etc.  
  
New board of directors with Ryan Cohen as chairman of the board, past achievements don't mean future success but he is coming in hot from Chewy.  
  
A new focus on Customer service much akin to how Chewy handles their customer service  
  
With the 2 at the market share offerings, they now hav 1.7 billionish dollars to reinvest in the company to facilitate it's future growth.

423,GDP," As I have wrote on other posts, (daily about BABA). I'm adding 9988 and 0700 as long as its still dipping. The current fear about china makes for great entry into companies that generate insane amount of money. 

  
The regulations Chinese government are making these companies follow are pretty much rules that other countries have had in place forever. Alibaba and Tencent have basically been able to run as they want for the past years, which has diminished competition in China greatly. This will put a small dent in their future growth probably, but their growth was already so insane that it does not really matter much. Chinese middle class, GDP and economy is growing at a faster rate than any other country. So I feel pretty safe buying stocks in China at these prices long term. 

So, frankly I find the risk/reward much better with Alibaba and Tencent at these prices than any other big company at the moment. For instance, the S&P500 has already risen like 20% ytd, where a normal year is 10%. All that while still recovering from Covid-19 and FED buying bonds every month. They are basically keeping their stock market artificially alive while China recovered economically long time ago.

434,AAPL," So usually with low volume contracts like what we’re talking about there barely any that get traded. Like for instance, the 100p AAPL contracts that expire next week had 0 trades (aapl would have to drop 30% like what we’re talking about). These contracts are also priced super super low. Like $1 usually.

But if I tried to buy 100 of these contracts, the price would shoot up. Supply and demand still holds true. With there being a super super low trade volume it makes the supply low, so if you flood the market with demand—by buying 100 (let alone millions of these contracts) the price would shoot up artificially and it would look sus. There will always be somebody willing to sell the contact (usually market makers) but the price will get more and more outrageous with how much the demand is stressing it

It would be possible to spread out the buying puts at many different strike prices, but you won’t get quite the insane returns. This would avoid overwhelming the supply available for any one contract price. It would be the most realistic way, although this might end up getting too far into the weeds depending on your audience.",MiddleSkill,2,/r/stocks/comments/ozuf3h/im_curious_if_anyone_can_help_me_understand_the/h837apm/,0.165,0.726,0.109,-0.8887

463,BTBT," Well, a couple of quick comments here as it’s happened to me a few times. The first thing to do is to assess what your “bankroll” looks like, then DIDI are just a small portion of that to buy a stock.

For example let’s say you have a $10,000 account. You should never spend more than 1-2% of that account on a position; and in this case you shouldn’t have more than two or three open positions at once.

So let’s say you wanted to open a position on BTBT that has been trading a lot lately, (has a really high IV though) and you think it’s going to go up. At close it was trading at $17.55. So if you wanted to risk $100 (1% of your bankroll) you’d buy 5 or 6 shares. Then set your profit target, and stop loss and see where it goes from there. You could also enter like 1 or 2 more positions, using the same calculations.

The point is, you never want to risk like 40% of what you have to invest with. That’s a sure way to blow your account. Also, once you’ve found and analyzed a company (through technical indicators or fundamental analysis) just look for a good entry and go from there. 

Good luck, I’ve only been in this game forever about 6 months and I am learning, but through reading books, listening to folks who have been successful (but ignoring the guys who tell me “You’ll make 10x by next week by following my program!!!”) you can do this.

Before I buy a stock, I always do my DD and look at the fundamentals, the market, competition, and growth prospects. Then, I decide what the maximum amount I want in a stock is.

I decide what my first entry point is, and then i set 2 DCA points.  I'll  put 25% of that maximum in as my entry buy.  If it drops to my first dca point, I'll put 35% of my maximum in - and if it drops to my second dca point then I'll put the final 40% in.

This method allows me to lower my cost average if I dont get lucky and time thr bottom perfectly.  It also comes with the assumption that I'm investing long term, and is backed up by my DD.",RumHam1,2,/r/stocks/comments/ozg9dl/how_do_you_deal_with_reverse_fomo/h81adx9/,0.025,0.81,0.165,0.9747

470,IMO," I didn't remove it.  Like I said, it looks funny written, but it sounds totally natural to my ear.  It's at the end of the first paragraph. 

PS: I probably wouldn't say ""I've boughten the eggs already"".  But I would say ""he had boughten the eggs already"". It makes it seem like it's further in the past or something.  No clue. But #2 sounds natural to me and #1 no.

Similar to ""gotten"" IMO.  ""He had just gotten up"" (vs. ""He had just got up"")",shortyafter,1,/r/stocks/comments/ozg9dl/how_do_you_deal_with_reverse_fomo/h7zqmqn/,0.076,0.789,0.134,0.7524
471,IIPR, Thanks for the feedback. IIPR isn’t big in my neck of the woods and for real estate investments it’s just a personal rule I have that I need to know and see the company I’m investing in.  Prologis dominates here. Last year around this time I got made fun of for suggesting Dropbox because I use it regularly and love everything about it. People said their service sucked and they had nothing special to sort through the competition of Microsoft and Apple. Basically I was being an emotional investor. Turned out to be a good buy even though I sold it way too soon.,Tremulant1,1,/r/stocks/comments/oziife/prologis_pld_crazy_pe_awesome_company/h80jsza/,0.048,0.805,0.147,0.8702

484,SQ," Lol wtf. Where are you getting those numbers from? SQ doesn’t need to grow 90%+ for 9 years to justify its valuation. If the stock market was expecting that than they would already be valued at at least $1 trillion, but they’re currently valued at $126 billion. Extremely reasonable given their torrid growth rate.
