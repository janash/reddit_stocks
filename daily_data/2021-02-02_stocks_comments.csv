0,GME," **updated** [the GME megathread is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/layb68/rstocks_gme_megathread/?sort=new)

We're on it.

I'm proposing a mega thread, it's gonna be semi manual:

* A single GME thread (automoderator will post it) and comments sorted by new
* GME comments will require min amount of characters or be redirected to the megathread
* GME posts will require double or triple the amount of min characters to post or be redirected to the megathread
* The mods will remove common/basic questions regarding GME like ""what's happening"" and send them to megathread
* The mods will remove GME loss porn and redirect to megathread
  * including making fun of WSB losses
  * And visa versa, gain porn

In the mean time, use the voting system appropriately and use the report button.

19,AMD," While I support the retail investors fighting back, I've been a little dismayed coming to this sub and the Stock Market sub and it's just filled with GME, Silver Misinformation, and rocketships.  There is no talk about any other stocks or strategies, and I'm actually trying to look for new sources of information without having to watch CNBC.  I've actually started watching the TD Ameritrade Network more, but I just want to learn how to trade better, and what stocks are hot and worth watching at least.  In the last  week I bought NextEra Energy and AMD, and that feels very long ago.

Does anyone have any recommendations for good quality sources, or things I can watch to get news that is not CNBC?  I actually liked watching The Market Zone segment and sometimes the Halftime Report, but after what I saw last week, I'm not a fan of Scott Wapner.  Maybe I might continue watching The Market Zone, but if you watch that channel one day, it's basically the same reports and news every day after that, and as much as I do like Sara Eisen, she can be kind of whiney sometimes.

I'm in options and I can do covered calls, and selling puts to get stocks at a cheaper price.  My goal this year is to become knowledgeable and do a Vertical Spread or any other strategy.

22,GME," People need to realize that a few people on Reddit found out about working together and had to push the narrative that it was against hedge funds and so they could draw a crowd and incite mass buyers. That was the only way something like this was going to work. The people who suffer are those who got in late, has no clue what they were doing or what a short even is, and think they're part of a rebellion towards hedge funds when in reality, yes, those hedge funds will lose some money but a ton of retail traders are going to get shafted. A lot of those GME early buyers who pumped it up have left and after days of telling them to HOLD, they disappeared. It's legit market manipulation. The hedge funds getting shafted was just the unintentional byproduct of this. The real money are from those who bought GME early on and have managed to drag that dead horse this entire way. I feel bad for the people who thought stock investing is this easy watching GME run rampant because they will develop horrible habits and the people who bought at $300 trying to ""HOLD THE LINE$ will now be waiting at food pantry lines.",Pure_Package,3,/r/stocks/comments/lalb69/we_have_to_take_care_of_this_sub/glqj99d/,0.132,0.832,0.036,-0.9672

I didn't know much about the stock market, however I spent time learning as much as possible, watching DFV's youtube videos, where he explains his research workflow, learning options and opening a brokerage with Wells Fargo. Overall I've made a small bit of profit (enough to cover a big car repair), and plan to do my own DD and invest in companies long term when I jump in again.

33,GME," Wsb was great for the memes and loss/gain porn alone. There’s definitely some solid advice/ideas but this whole GME situation is likely the end of them. 

Between the massive amounts of purposely false info/bots/shill accounts that were bought there is now an influx of people with absolutely no investing experience just flooding and spamming the sub which has led to massive media coverage... a lot of which wasnt good. 

They just went from 2ish million to close to 8 million in a short amount of time while reddit/ robinhood also went to the top spots in the App Store as well. I’m all for newcomers but the amount of people asking stupid questions over and over or just spreading false info or bullshit they have no idea about is already way out of hand. 

I’d seriously keep an eye out here as well for accounts that are brand new, or have massive periods of downtime and then suddenly becoming active in wsb or investing etc. 

One of the top posts on wsb right now shows another removed post where it’s an obvious shill account. The top two comments were also shill accounts with shit tons of awards and a groups of people buying it.

And held some shares for the rest of the ride. Now I got some more money to play with and will be watching closely for some good DD. It went from a fun joke to a scary cult in wsb real fast.

45,GM," Well, I like to kind of Warren Buffett it. I do have a 401k portfolio that is professionally managed.  I also had originally 6 to 7 k in stocks that I managed.  I did a bunch of stuff when the pandemic hit in early March. I bought stock in companies that made stuff I thought people would want. For at least 6 months. Yes I didn't think of everything nor could I afford it. However I did pretty good, doubled my money. Had to sell some stuff because I was also unemployed.  I read the paper, the business section, it tends to seep in my brain better but I'm old. I look at stuff like hmm this company here is making a covid vaccine but they are also making a drug that works for a problem besides. A common problem. Ok that sounds interesting, let's see if they are publicly owned. Then I learn a bit about them and decide if I'm going to buy stock. That's my strategy. I also buy stocks that pay dividends.  I have to say I did buy the,gme at 75 and I did sell all of it but 1. I paid a terrible dental bill with it. It was a good 11 k all together. I also write stuff down when I see an interesting article so I can refer back to it in making my decisions.  I think this is your dd,  before you spend money. I did buy Nio, I think it has potential. I was tempted by GM but they have a bad rep in our family. My dad had stock in them that was worthless when they declared bankruptcy, so yeah I'll pass on them. That might not be the soundest decision. But car brands, idk.. to me it's way safer to buy mondalez and large food companies because people got to eat.",basketma12,181,/r/stocks/comments/lalb69/we_have_to_take_care_of_this_sub/glp2jmx/,0.069,0.812,0.119,0.8847
46,GME," Same here. I had to stop following WSB. They seem to be running a Ponzi scheme now. You are only allowed to talk about pumping GME. Otherwise ban or downvote until oblivion.

What is more disgusting is that they are also actively spreading FUD on other subreddits to try to disqualify other people's DD's like the one [they published here trying to disqualify the silver investments](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/la34bh/its_fucking_awful_seeing_the_silver/)

Did they even checked how much silver related stocks Citadel owns? It is not even the 1% of their portfolio... And if they care so much about not pumping stuff owned by hedge funds then why they don't tell that [blackrock owns 14% of GME?](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme)

They only care to keep convincing people to put money into GME to keep running their Ponzi scheme and they keep repeating lies like the short interest is at 128% when it is more than known that they are using very outdated data. Short interest [is only updated twice a month](http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=shortintpubsch) so the last data they have is from 1/27. However an independent third party (V8 partners) today 2/2 published new data [showing only 48% shorted shares](https://gmeshortreport.com/), which means that most of the shorts already covered. But of course they won't tell that because it goes against their rhetorical of keep pumping GME.

Even someone who is relatively new to WSB, I’m shocked at how much people are encouraging others to “go all in” on a single stock. It’s bad advice in general, let alone when it was at $350. It doesn’t matter if the stock spikes to a much higher price, people who are making bad decisions like that won’t have an exit strategy and won’t pull out in time.

The memes are funny, but people are talking about putting all of their savings or even half their savings in a single stock. I was trying to talk down someone who wanted to bet their rent money, just a few days before their rent was due because they thought it would skyrocket on Friday.

101,AAL," I've got money in AAL, DAL and JAPSY (American, Delta, and Japan Air).

Here's my thinking - 

American does a lot of domestic, which should start to creep back to normal levels once we get more vaccine out. It's at a fairly low point right now, so nothing but room to grow.

Delta has a nice spread of domestic and international, as well as a solid track record, and a loyal customer base. They'll come back strong, when they're able to travel, and it's at a decent low right now.

JAL is a personal fav, but also, I feel like the Asian airlines will be a good indicator, since Asia is handling the virus much better than most. I was hoping for an Olympics rise, but that's not going to happen. Again, it's also at a decent low, and has plenty of room for growth.

104,SAVE," I'm a fan of SAVE (Spirit Airlines). I think they're going to be one of the few airline companies worth more in 2022 then they were in early 2020.

A lot of airlines are going to struggle to recover quickly because they rely on international and business travel, both of which (I think) are likely to be heavily reduced this year (compared to previous years).

SAVE though pretty much only does domestic flights and is an ultra-low cost carrier so it's never had many business travellers to begin with. I believe that, like you said, there will be a boom in people traveling but I think a lot of it will be limited to the US because a) less countries taking tourists, b) people will want to see missed friends/family and c) will most likely be poorer.

119,GME," Note that I have no position in GME. This is just my personal opinion, not financial advice.

I truly believed in the short squeeze thesis. However, the game is rigged. I believe a lot of the shares retail investors are holding are counterfeit. The hedge funds fabricated new shares to sell, and retail investors bought them up. They are playing by different rules than we are. They've covered enough to prevent a short squeeze from occurring. The volume on the charts indicate that many people are locking in their profits and exiting. The shorts are buying up the shares to cover. The short interest is now even lower than it was before Monday.

As soon as the hedge funds were losing they started manipulating the markets. They stopped people from buying GME. They increased the margin requirements during the middle of the trading day, causing people who bought GME on margin to be margin called and sold out of their positions automatically.

They apparently covered ~30m shares on Friday with only ~50m in volume while causing downward price pressure. I believe they did this by using options, so it wouldn't show up in the volume. People are questioning the data but I think the data is accurate. The shorts are covering while the price is decreasing. That's the opposite of a short squeeze.

There is no longer a supply and demand imbalance due to there being excessive shares. I think retail traders own more than 100% of the float. The hedge funds created counterfeit shares to sell to the public. They basically printed money. They were betting on GameStop to go bankrupt so they wouldn't get caught. They weren't worried about a short squeeze, they were worried about being caught issuing counterfeit shares. There are more than enough shares to purchase for them to cover their shorts, so retail traders have no advantage in forcing short sellers to buy their shares.

The short squeeze should've happened by now if it were going to happen. Instead we only saw the gamma squeeze. Hedge funds lost a lot of money still, just not as much as we were all hoping for.

I think the time to exit was last week during the gamma squeeze. If you're holding then you're probably going to hold as the price continues to decrease, waiting for a short squeeze that'll never happen.",tidemp,6,/r/stocks/comments/lalb69/we_have_to_take_care_of_this_sub/glphzo2/,0.071,0.832,0.097,0.8427

3. Without telling anyone, restrict trading to retail investors yet allowing hedge funds to trade.
4. Without telling anyone, FORCE PEOPLE TO SELL THEIR STOCKS. Non margin, non leveraged bought with cash stocks.  EToro looking at you.
5. Show how the SEC is a complete joke and has sold out to the hedge funds.

168,GME," The way I see it, GME is a ticking timebomb. Hedge funds can't keep this up. When will the bomb go off? No one knows. In theory, hedge funds can keep their short positions forever. The only thing you need to remember is that even at $80 they're bleeding interest payments. Originally they brought GME down from $20 to $4. $80 is the lowest it got today, that's still 4 times the amount on which hedge funds jumped on the bandwagon. Even after the short squeeze, I don't see the price dropping significantly below $80 with the Ryan Cohen formula ([www.gmedd.com](https://www.gmedd.com)). 

Of course, for me it's easy to hold since I got in at $16 so I can't put myself in your shoes. You must indeed feel like a fool for getting in at $300+ right now.

Yes, it's speculative and you can't be right all the time but any form of investing is believing or having confidence that when the coin flips you'll be on the right side of it.

If the Market Maker can buy into a short fund, collude with clearing houses and restrict brokerage trade to the point that a share with momentum can be short laddered down to zero with minimum volume, how can you expect the same exact methods won't be or haven't been used against other shares?

235,OR," I want to counter some of your point.

Normally yes, jumping into a bubble once it’s formed could be a quick way off a cliff.  A bubble is by definition detached from fundamentals.

This play, the last two weeks, wasn’t a bet on fundamentals OR raw hype.  It was a bet on the mechanics of the market, the integrity of market supervision, and against people who made a greedy, selfish, destructive choice (to publicly bet against the success of a nearly extinguished business, solely to profit when their own bet and it’s accompanying propaganda burn the company down to ash or less.  Think about this: the gamblers bet the share price was too high at $4, to squeeze out a penny, with the losing side of the bet being infinity.) It’s an exploit in how the market functions, in that if people make too many side bets, and are all wrong, they are out a ton of money when all their bets were 10:1 or 100:1 or 1000:1 odds.  This is about “making those that bet wrong” a reality, by manifesting “right” through share ownership.  It’s creating reality through willpower, and balls of fucking steel (now called diamond hands, maybe to be more inclusive.)  Simply, you’re right* as long as you have faith and don’t panic, (unless everyone else panics, but that was a well advertised, if not the most advertised, risk going in. The second biggest risk being what appears to have started to play out, that the losers start flipping the chess board and stealing the kickball, market integrity be damned.) It’s also not, collusion, because what’s going on is, somebody’s publishing the manual for “how to be right” publicly, (which is a good thing, an efficient market requires access to up to date accurate information) and each person who reads the manual is allowed to make up their own mind of if they want to buy, while risking being hoodwinked (or abandoned, which although unintentional, probably falls into the category of hoodwinks, or at least misplaced faith in fellow comrades and participants.) The manual becomes reality when a certain volume of people execute its plan (not dissimilar from religion in some ways.) It’s NOT a pump and dump because there are contractually obligated buyers lined up, the intent is not to leave those who enter last holding the bag. The last person to buy in could still profit at the expense of the gamblers.  So any normal analysis that focuses on fundamentals, bubbles or hype/pump is missing the entire conversation by applying a normal lens to an abnormal situation.  The correct analysis in this situation is closer to game theory like the prisoners dilemma, what is almost the inverse of the sunk cost fallacy (in that a belief in the sunk cost fallacy would cause someone to cut their losses as opposed to double down on or hold
their convictions, which in effect undoes the maneuver,) the ethics of distorting reality through fake information and propaganda (including current market price manipulation) and consensus reality theory vs the victor writing the history books (and the most capitalized writing the rule book.)

Basically: people likely wrote more ious than they can repay, and thus having an iou in your hand is worth more than what’s written on the iou.  They are then “supposed to” have to recursively buy the ious, pay them, hand it back out for free (there are accusations they “double spent”, not to dissimilar from a problem blockchain were designed to solve,) and then buy the same iou again; per any sane interpretation of the rules. This market event executing successfully, could lead to infinite share price. A divide by 0 of sorts. Every player on the winning side of the bet leaves with infinite money. In that series of events, there’s a real chance the losing gamblers default on their iou, declare bankruptcy, and true chaos ensues.  I have to imagine the intent for many was to hold the iou until an appropriate and acceptable price was paid, not to wait until the ious were written off and forgiven.  Some though, did just want to watch the gamblers burn, profit be damned. The numbers, the instantaneous price, the dips, are damn near irrelevant.

To summarize my point further: 36h is too short a timeframe to learn anything of value, through participation alone. The price is erratic as all hell as Wall Street robots fuck around with the price in a panicked attempt to avoid this market mechanic actually exploding into a money geyser. All you experienced was 36h of synthetic volatility.  There is plenty of time to read the manual more closely, and decide you want to risk manifesting a new reality.  There is also plenty more time for the people who made bad bets to hack reality to their own benefit, through misinformation or what I believe amounts to straight fraud. There is also enough time for those uneducated in the situation to spread their misreasoned cloud of doubt like a poison shadow killing everyone who sticks by their otherwise correct gumptions. My asterisk above near the word right was meant to signify; you can be right and still lose when reality is hacked or polluted by uninformed idiocy, thus making you wrong.  A fun paradox.

Finally, there are other possible endgames than; the jumpers get dumped, or the gamblers implode, which include: the company making a stock offering, collecting cash from the situation and thus making the company more valuable than it was.  That kind of move would likely keep the stock higher than it was before this started, thus making this roller coaster a good investment for many, even in the event the squeeze was avoided.

(I wish any news anchor on any local news channel just used this as an explanation instead of interviewing some random talking head who has cautionary tales about chasing trends. The amount of “boomers” misdescribing what’s going on is painful and negligent journalism. If anyone is ever writing a history book (these things made of paper we used to store information in) someday, feel free to quote and crib this.)

They don't. The stock might be going to $8, $80, $800, or $8000.

Once the short bubble burst (which it may or may not have), the stock is back to being nothing but a pump and dump stock being held up by it's popularity. 

In the VW short squeeze, the $200 stock went up to $1000. In GME a $20 stock went up to $485...That might have been the peak. No one knows. 

I just want to link to something I posted 4 days about this whole situation. Back when GME was still in the $300-400 range:

[I'm obviously not DFV, but he should seriously consider walking away at some point. $13 million is great, but $50-60 million is still private jet and house in the Hamptons money.

This post about thinkin about what’s good for your money.

What should GME share price be?  Recent price targets on Finviz state $10-$33.

I don’t think GME is really valued at $30B market cap and $350/share, which is compareable to Best Buy.  When I think about the number/size of those stores, their online presence, and how often people shop where, it doesn’t seem right.

If I wanted to short a company, GME might be a good candidate because it’s over valued, not to mention the uncertainty around it. Shorts put out misinformation(short attacks) the same way permabulls hype their bags. Question all media.

Short interest is still strong, but if they doubled down from $350, theyre making back what they lost on the prior bad short bets, and theyre still wanting stock price to go down.  Could short bets have cycled from losing to winning short bets since last week?  I don’t know how to see this, but it’s worth considering.

Either way, i'm here to watch this shit go down. Glad to say I was part of it, in some way. I'm in the negative now because I was wayyy to greedy. thankfully I understood it was a gamble (NOT AN INVESTMENT), and that all odds are stacked against me, especially after that whole robinhood/restriction drama. 

I hope I'm wrong, not for my own sake, but for others. I've been seeing posts of people dropping 50k-100k on GME when it was in the 300's. People saying they want to help loved ones/family members, it really makes me sad to think about. Almost makes me want to vomit. I hope these people get profit, if not, I hope they financially recover from this whole shit if it goes tits up.

In this informational rain of fallacies it's certainly difficult to understand what's happening, as everyone seems to be lying.

However one would think that paid services like ortex aren't lying, and what it's showing is that short positions have plummeted. This is consistent with the market finally going up on tech stocks. For example AMD stock fall is nicely correlated with the GME squeeze, and yesterday it finally went up a bit, after GME short positions were supposedly covered by a large amount.

I would expect hedge funds to make new short positions on this high price on GME, so I don't expect them to just go to zero.

Why would the media target people towards silver?

319,GME," The restrictions from the brokers first felt to me like they are joining the Hedge Funds, but when seeing the drop I questioned myself if it was really that, or if they know something we don't know, that it will never come to the short squeeze and they did in fact secure their customers. But whatever this would mean that they know they can't share.

That moment didn't stay for long though. I thought back how insanely the shift of attention was. Cramer, silver news and pretty much all for the GME short squeeze mostly got silent or shifted their attention to something WSB didn't even start. For people that followed this - even just for publicity - they should know better, meaning this is nothing coming out for a legitimate reason, but promotion.

On WSB you see more bots than ever before that post the exact same comment 5-20 times a minute, inducing fear. This again fits to the silver thing and efforts that make no sense if there is no needed reason behind this.

I'm gonna be honest, I put way more into GME than I should have. I could cut losses now and just go somewhere else, but what holds me back is that everything happening feels too weird. Another thought I had with the silver shift is that the uproar around GME might become huge and still for the security of the retail investors, but why promote something that sends thousands, if not millions of people on a future/stock that citadel has a big share off and they (retail) will lose that money? So I also crossed that theory out rather quickly.

I will keep holding GME. While I put in more than I should have, as I said, I don't need the money. It's the money I used for trading and it has no other use. At this point I will ride it to hell and eventually over time get back to trading.

Edit: I decided yesterday, after reading the T+2 to cover, that I will watch closely what happens today but if I see no positive result that I will stay away from trading and use another broker to restart, leaving GME behind me for sanity reasons but monitor it from time to time to see what happens. I have a notification alarm if it hits 400 that will get me back in, but since I am willing to lose all at this point there is no reason to watch the insanely weird behaviour happening every day.",oodex,2,/r/stocks/comments/laln2m/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next/glppd90/,0.119,0.811,0.07,-0.9602

Probably unrelated one to another. One of the brorker's excuses/explanations is that they now have to have a collateral of 100% for the shares bought to the clearing-house. DTC has made the cost of the collateral of the two-day holding period extremely expensive.

They (brokers) cannot use people's money (illegal) so that's why Robinhood is getting injected biilions, since they have their own clearing-house.

This also would explain why other brokers didn't limit buying - the clearing-house of those were having the liquidity to cover those collaterals.

The buying restrictions is also a tool of limiting volatility and always providing a 100% coverage for the stock bought.

I fail to see the logic of shorts letting themselves getting squeezed even more... Sure there are rules that market needs to follow, but i think that the ""big guys"" always find the the way out.

At the beginning I've understood the logic behind the GME movement and when Melvin had to close their position it was a big victory for WSB. But what i don't understand is why wouldn't you just take your profit and live to fight another day? Many people have earned more money in couple of weeks than they will in their lifetime, and waiting on something more just counters any logic. This opportunity presents itself once in a lifetime, and to ignore it is just being greedy with a combination of solid FOMO.   


My assumption is that most of people that invested in this will not get their profit out... and is it reasonable at all to expect the price to go up to 1000$?

1) Do I believe RH had the buying power of half the daily volume or more of GME?

2) do I believe traders on RH who were looking to buy meaningful amounts of GME stayed with RH vs opening an account at any of the other numerous free brokers?

The answer I come up with is no on both. Then I turn to the volume overall. Volume was less than 10MM a day until January 13th and then it really took off and exceeded 100MM for 4 out of 9 days. 10x increase in volume, mostly after the last officially reported short data as of 1/15. This, in my mind, was not all retail buying. You just don’t see retail investors with that kind of buying power.

Now, volume is back down to 35-50MM but that is still 5x+ where it was just 2 weeks ago. I see this as still high volume, not low volume.

All of this leads me to believe the early shorts have in fact covered. There probably are new shorts that entered $350+ but the short interest and short squeeze is probably done. It happened when it went from $30 to $400 on >10x normal volume over 10 days. We can’t just discount that a 1,200% gain is not a “real” short squeeze.

This has become a cultural event of our lifetimes and I hope it brings positive change to the markets but I don’t think there are enough shares held by the ‘diamond hand’ gang to support the price from continuing to fall and some people are going to suffer 90%+ losses.

Now, volume is back down to 35-50MM but that is still 5x+ where it was just 2 weeks ago. I see this as still high volume, not low volume.

All of this leads me to believe the early shorts have in fact covered. There probably are new shorts that entered $350+ but the short interest and short squeeze is probably done. It happened when it went from $30 to $400 on >10x normal volume over 10 days. We can’t just discount that a 1,200% gain is not a “real” short squeeze.

This has become a cultural event of our lifetimes and I hope it brings positive change to the markets but I don’t think there are enough shares held by the ‘diamond hand’ gang to support the price from continuing to fall and some people are going to suffer 90%+ losses. That was never a matter of if, only when.",Golfman74,1,/r/stocks/comments/laln2m/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next/glpxr18/,0.035,0.864,0.101,0.9671

331,MSM," The reason the restrictions are still there is because DTCC still has the collateral at 100%, so the liquidity problem is still there. But if the shorts are covered, why do they still feel necessary to have a high collateral? Collateral is there to protect the clearing company from holding the bag in case of failure to deliver from the selling broker. High amount of failure to deliver is usually related to naked shorts, naked calls, synthetic longs etc. (all of which are dubious practices at best). Furthermore, S3 changed the way they calculate short float; if you take their new number of 55% and convert it to the previous way of calculating, it is still 120%. Lastly, the volume traded (actual volume outside of the ladder attacks) was not enough to close so many short positions. Obviously there is a lot of confuscation and misinformation going on and it is impossible for retail investors to truly find out what's happening, but the narrative being pushed by MSM just makes no sense at all.

359,GME," Hey, thanks for the quality posts u/hooman_or_whatever 

In your next post, can you answer this question?

Do you think the GME thing will play out like VW (which is what WSB thinks) or like TSLA (which is what I think).

The way I see it, VW was a play by Porsche to gain ownership over VW and the reason for the spike was because Porsche had a lot of options which sellers did not expect would ever be exercised, but then Porsche suddenly announced they would take delivery of the shares. So option sellers suddenly had to buy and deliver shares that they didn't expect they needed and that caused a huge temporal spike in price.

I see no mechanism for such a play with GME.

Instead, I see a parallel between GME and the ""most shorted stock of 2019-2020"", TSLA.

There was no single point in time when shorts covered on Tesla. Instead, it was a long bumpy ride throughout 2020 which ended with a $40B loss for shorts. But no point in time. I guess the S&P inclusion was the only significant point in time event, but that didn't really cause a huge spike, just a few extra days of Green.

And that's honestly how I think GME will play out, a long and slow rise to $500 over the next 6 months.",alvvayson,12,/r/stocks/comments/laln2m/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next/glqb38j/,0.048,0.808,0.144,0.9545

391,GS," I meant, it was a gamble for newer people dumping money on a random stock, at peak prices, based on hype and nothing else, hoping to get rich. 

As for believing in GS is a whole different thing.. Unless they focus more on gaming peripherals, and are a bit more aggressive with the pc gaming market, I just don't ever see it doing well. Nobody cares for physical copies of games anymore, let alone ""used ones"". When they do, they usually buy used from others. 

I can easily see gamestop doing great if they ever choose to sell pc components (gpus/cpus/motherboards/ so on..). Consumers are hungry for these things nowdays as pc gaming has become the norm.

392,DD," I bought in at a 309 and sold at 220 or something yesterday. (All money I had no problem loosing just wanted to get in on the fun).

I came to the conclusion yesterday that at this level of hype and volatility (despite all the DD that shorts haven't covered bla bla) that the little guy isn't going to win. The little guy won last week when the hedge funds got caught with their pants down. At this point they've almost certainly found a way out of this and there's no way a disorganized reddit mob can fight back when the game is rigged against them.

394,GME," 1. They still don’t want to run out again if people continue to purchase. 
2. No one knows so you can’t use it as a point in investment thesis.
3. Compare the volume to search trends for GME on google and Twitter. 37m in volume is plenty. That’s 1/2 of total stock exchanging hands in one day.
4. Option delivery is still a thing. Considering they have to deliver exercised options, these trades can happen. Especially since the option demand was insane. You don’t know if these trades are coming from a market maker or a hedge fund, so that’s pretty speculative. Ladders don’t work because funds lose money on them, and in this volume it is just impossible. Short ladders were used in the past by shady hedge funds on low cap and low volume stocks. That’s where they are effective.
5. They can and absolutely box. Buying a long positions and opening a synthetic long is what they do all the time. Do you expect a fund that hedges to sit and hope that the price goes down?

395,GME," I think most of the postulations going around are not actually wrong, but are dangerous in the way they tend to treat everything as either/or.

The shorts may not have covered completely or as much as they claim, but they could have covered quite a bit.  They also could still be trying manipulating prices. I mean if we were them, we’d be doing that too.  Robinhood could genuinely have some liquidity issues AND halting GME to fix it because of side deals.  Also people are overlooking what a PR minefield this is for them.  They were already being accused of gamifying stocks; this isn’t helping.  Retail investors are almost certainly not as diamond hands as the posters would like you to believe, but they are holding pretty strong.  

Shorts have an incentive both to cover their positions to prevent further loss but also to double down on a certain percentage.  Same is true of people holding.  Everyone is trying to spread their risks somewhat.  And new players have entered the game. There are attempts from all sides to spread confusion, but at the same time the situation has gotten more complex.

The loudest voices tend to be people viewing this as some sort of personal grudge war between hedge funds and retail investors but most actors think with their wallets first.  So there probably is some human emotion and ego biasing everyone’s behavior at some level, but that doesn’t mean that’s all they care about.",ttd_76,1,/r/stocks/comments/laln2m/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next/glq6h32/,0.093,0.774,0.133,0.8843

>Here's what I think. I'm trying to put my feet in the shoes of managers working at the institutions on both sides of this play. I'll simplify it to the **BlackRock gang** and **Melvin Gang (longs vs shorts**). Both of these gangs have **ownership of equities and debt across the markets, in every industry.** Kind of like a bunch of mob families in Little Italy New York. There's tension between them, and the conflict can spill and hurt innocent parties outside the immediate conflict (in this case, the squeeze's impact would spill into other areas of the economy and cause instability).  
>  
>Just like in ""The Big Short"", people high up there know each other. Probably over the weekend, they've been calling back and forth, manager to manager, to find a way to put out the fire and maintain the peace. Because if the short squeeze happens, some of the big whales in Blackrock gang would get burned (not their positions in GME, but other unrelated holdings across the market that might get devaluated). BlackRock might momentarily gain from a squeeze, but even that's temporary since the price goes back down - they'll never enjoy the inflated ""squeezed"" value long term (maybe 5 years from now it will be $150 if Ryan Cohen pulls off a Chewy). It's not worth it to them to have the rest of their portfolio be in danger with a potential downfall of the market (worst case scenario). If I were a manager at any one of these funds, **I would have been aware of a squeeze a week or two ago already** (they've got teams of analysts analyzing their equities around the clock, forecasting all potential outcomes and valuations with their sophisticated data models) and planning accordingly.  
>  
>Given the widespread expectation of a squeeze happening, and forecasting the impact, **as a manager at any one of these institutions I'd rather it be that a few retail casualties get burned from losing money on a risky play, bring the price of GME back to earth and stabilize it, keep the markets from fluctuating so other positions of mine remain steady, and let GameStop get back to turning around their company**. This would be in my best interest as an institution with a lot on the line, rather than letting retail investors blow up the company's price and participating in a ""major distribution of wealth"".

>  
>But realistically, [the information out there is asymmetrical](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asymmetricinformation.asp). We don't have the full picture, whereas they do (or at least more than we do) since they probably have each other on speed dial. The media can't be trusted - we're getting updated with short interest numbers only once a month (by the time we get accurate numbers it will be too late), or some random ass estimations from S3 who change their narrative 180 degrees in a 6 hour timespan on a Sunday because of who knows what (Did Melvin capital slide some money to S3 to confuse the retails? Highly possible). These guys can call each other up and talk numbers, specifics, in a way that the public will never be able to because the average retail investors (not downplaying the amazing investors I've come across in WSB - but the majority are truly retards that follow trends) are not professionally equipped to make market impacting decisions.

These institutions can also sweep through all these (public) posts on Reddit, Stocktwits, Twitter, gather their due diligence on what we would do, what are our strategies, and pull out a card that we'd never anticipate or expect. It's like we're playing poker, but they can see our cards and also know which cards are coming next from the deck. It was never meant to be fair. u/Deepfuckingvalue was incredibly prudent, but also took a risk that couldn't have forecasted Ryan Cohen's entry or stock purchase. It played out well for him, and good for him, but if we want to make our riches it will have to be on another play.

*Edit:*

I'd like to specify one more thing here. Let's take things a few weeks back - was BlackRock gang in communication with Melvin gang? No, I don't believe so. Were they aware of the fact that they were trying to short the shit out of their holdings Gamestop? Absolutely. Blackrock gang have their convictions as to why they think Gamestop warrants a long position. Melvin gang have their convictions as to why GME is worthless. The >100% interest is an anomaly for sure, but neither gangs expected the media coverage that ensued along with the swarm of retail investors trying to play at the poker table. The stakes got much higher a week or so ago, the second all those call options expired ITM. Shit got a lot more serious, for both gangs, once a squeeze became realistic - which is why I believe there may have been some kind of behind the scenes communication to resolve the issue before it got too out of hand. The HFs got fucked this month, they were punished. Perhaps enough by Blackrock gang's standards.

427,GME," Respectfully, volume is low? It's 37 million isn't it? Last week was 110 million, yeah, but 37 million is a shit ton. 3 month average is 27 million. So you have 137% of normal volume. Or something?

There's also 60 million shares, 30 percent are held by insiders. Another good chunk are held by institutions. There's probably 10 to 20 million that's actually traded day to day.  That means shares are swapping hands two to four times a day. They're having trouble keeping track of all the trading! Michael Burry said it took weeks for his broker to find his shares for the reason. It's been a lot. It's still a lot. Just because it ain't 110 million doesn't mean it isn't high.

WSB strategy is literally not to trade either so that cuts down on volume too. Buying was restricted on Thursday. It's Monday. People who want to buy have had several days to set up new accounts elsewhere and get funds transferred. If people wanted to buy it, they would have today and you would've seen the price continue to climb. Instead it's been two days of falling. It's now trading at $162/135 euros in Germany at this very moment.


I hope, I really hope you and everyone with shares still in GME make it in out with a lot of profit. It seems people are bordering on delusion though. I'm seeing so much denial, there's literally conspiracy theories in WSB about what's happening. Explaining the drop and how is not over. It's turning so ugly....

428,RH," It makes perfect sense - it's people exiting as they realize they missed the peak. Someone already responded to the volume argument so I'll leave that one alone.

&#x200B;

I know it sucks, but it was over when RH and other brokers restricted trades and prevented another truly ""short"" squeeze. And remember this stock had already squeezed from $5 to over $500, it's not like there hadn't been a squeeze.

&#x200B;

No hate, but I'm guessing you bought it because of the hype and probably over $200 or even $300 a share (based on your post history saying you were running a loss 4 days ago). You can learn from it and move on, making better investments in the future - or just pretend it was all someone else's fault, a vast conspiracy, etc. And I've been there - look up Tilray - I was a bag holder on that one because I refused to accept I had missed the ride.

&#x200B;

WSB as a subreddit is also ruined. I don't know how long I've been subbed there, but if you are new it is literally millions of new accounts with inexperienced traders just spamming memes and bullshit (like the 100 shares = ladder attacks proof) at each other. Do yourself a favor and spend some time in r/investing or r/stocks \- WSB is a dumpster fire and will NEVER be the same.

*""Here's what I think. I'm trying to put my feet in the shoes of managers of institutions on both sides of this play. I'll simplify it to the BlackRock gang and Melvin Gang (longs vs shorts).

*Given the expectation of a squeeze happening, and forecasting the impact, as a manager at any one of these institutions I'd rather it be that a few retail casualties get burned from losing money on a risky play, bring the price of GME back to earth and stabilize it, keep the markets stable so other positions of mine remain stable, and let Gamestop get back to focusing on turning around their company. This would be in my best interest as an institution with a lot on the line, rather than letting retail investors blow up the company's price and participating in a ""major distribution of wealth"".*

Well...Drop to  180 won't kill me so... It's more than 150% of current price. No way. And  then the drop to 118 occured ;p So... After this I was like... Okey. I  don't know what's going on, I don't understand why it's going on, the trade is banned, politics are all over it, I'm out.

For me, this was not about stock anymore. I guess I  was grabbed by the hype, which caused  me to miscalculate what is actually going on. It was fun tho... Lot of  money and wild ride. Just not enough self-awareness on selling-point  (and standing by it).  I am not from US, so... I didn't fully realize what's going on huge scale and get caught between some  class fight (which... I don't think is actually real - I believe shorts covered a lot in recent week).

For me squeeze happened on Thursday, but it was artificially shut down by trade ban. That's it. If someone figured out what the hell is going on - could make a heck of a money. For me, that is a lesson for next ""hyped"" investments. Don't fall for hype totally, think for yourself, made you exit points clear and remember, that if you want to fight the system, don't start it at the end (like now a lot of people get in). I was more or less lucky, because I lost 2k on Thursday. But won't get in again even if it will explode to 500.

I'd like to add to this

Here's what I think. I'm trying to put my feet in the shoes of managers working at the institutions on both sides of this play. I'll simplify it to the **BlackRock gang** and **Melvin Gang (longs vs shorts**). Both of these gangs have **ownership of equities and debt across the markets, in every industry.** Kind of like a bunch of mob families in Little Italy New York. There's tension between them, and the conflict can spill and hurt innocent parties outside the immediate conflict (in this case, the squeeze's impact would spill into other areas of the economy and cause instability).

Just like in ""The Big Short"", people high up there know each other. Probably over the weekend, they've been calling back and forth, manager to manager, to find a way to put out the fire and maintain the peace. Because if the short squeeze happens, some of the big whales in Blackrock gang would get burned (not their positions in GME, but other unrelated holdings across the market that might get devaluated). BlackRock might momentarily gain from a squeeze, but even that's temporary since the price goes back down - they'll never enjoy the inflated ""squeezed"" value long term (maybe 5 years from now it will be $150 if Ryan Cohen pulls off a Chewy). It's not worth it to them to have the rest of their portfolio be in danger with a potential downfall of the market (worst case scenario). If I were a manager at any one of these funds, **I would have been aware of a squeeze a week or two ago already** (they've got teams of analysts analyzing their equities around the clock, forecasting all potential outcomes and valuations with their sophisticated data models) and planning accordingly.

Given the widespread expectation of a squeeze happening, and forecasting the impact, **as a manager at any one of these institutions I'd rather it be that a few retail casualties get burned from losing money on a risky play, bring the price of GME back to earth and stabilize it, keep the markets from fluctuating so other positions of mine remain steady, and let GameStop get back to turning around their company**. This would be in my best interest as an institution with a lot on the line, rather than letting retail investors blow up the company's price and participating in a ""major distribution of wealth"".

Don't get me wrong, as a retail investor, I personally say fuck it give me the money!! I saw my portfolio go up to life changing values this week, found myself fantasizing how I could buy a house for my mom like she always wanted, and giving her the freedom to finally leave her 9-5 dead-end job. But I got greedy. I thought I was smart, joining a herd, riding a tidal wave that these sharks could never handle.

But realistically, [the information out there is asymmetrical](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asymmetricinformation.asp). We don't have the full picture, whereas they do (or at least more than we do) since they probably have each other on speed dial. The media can't be trusted - we're getting updated with short interest numbers only once a month (by the time we get accurate numbers it will be too late), or some random ass estimations from S3 who change their narrative 180 degrees in a 6 hour timespan on a Sunday because of who knows what (Did Melvin capital slide some money to S3 to confuse the retails? Highly possible). These guys can call each other up and talk numbers, specifics, in a way that the public will never be able to because the average retail investors (not downplaying the amazing investors I've come across in WSB - but the majority are truly retards that follow trends) are not professionally equipped to make market impacting decisions.

These institutions can also sweep through all these (public) posts on Reddit, Stocktwits, Twitter, gather their due diligence on what we would do, what are our strategies, and pull out a card that we'd never anticipate or expect. It's like we're playing poker, but they can see our cards and also know which cards are coming next from the deck. It was never meant to be fair. u/Deepfuckingvalue was incredibly prudent, but also took a risk that couldn't have forecasted Ryan Cohen's entry or stock purchase. It played out well for him, and good for him, but if we want to make our riches it will have to be on another play.

&#x200B;

*Edit:*

I'd like to specify one more thing here. Let's take things a few weeks back - was BlackRock gang in communication with Melvin gang? No, I don't believe so. Were they aware of the fact that they were trying to short the shit out of their holdings Gamestop? Absolutely. Blackrock gang have their convictions as to why they think Gamestop warrants a long position. Melvin gang have their convictions as to why GME is worthless. The >100% interest is an anomaly for sure, but neither gangs expected the media coverage that ensued along with the swarm of retail investors trying to play at the poker table. The stakes got much higher a week or so ago, the second all those call options expired ITM. Shit got a lot more serious, for both gangs, once a squeeze became realistic - which is why I believe there may have been some kind of behind the scenes communication to resolve the issue before it got too out of hand. The HFs got fucked this month, they were punished. Perhaps enough by Blackrock gang's standards.

504,GME," Yeah this - the originally thesis behind GME made a lot of sense, ie hedge funds over shorting the stock down to zero, Ryan Cohen coming onboard etc. That arguably justified the rise from $10 to $60-70.

But at this point it just seems like a retail pump (that is flagging very quickly). Melvin Capital who were admittedly very over leveraged have exited their positions - and whilst short interest might still be relatively high, what WSB doesn’t seem to realize is these shorts have probably entered their position at $200 or $300 and are using less leverage than Melvin (if they’re smart).

I sold my GME shares already because I’m not buying into the mob mentality. It’s done. GME is done. Short interest are below 50% and I cashed out. To buy shares and stick it to the man is trading with emotions, trade with emotions and lose money. 

Wall Street, we all know they are corrupt but every pro retail investors knows that. Pro retail investors ride in a car that Wall Street is driving.

In my opinion it is like in a casino, you can go there count cards in Blackjack, you make some gainz, after some time the casino realizes it, they pull you to the backyard and beat the shit out of you.

This is what happend with GME, the folks where winning, but then the casino pulled the plug and put threading restrictions, we lost momentum and the Hedge funds got enough time to regroup and position them new. You can never get these 24 hours back these momentum.

I got into GME at 39 $, and it was wow if we crack 100 it would be amazing, after Elon posted we cracked 200, I just don't see any events like this happen anymore, but anyway I really hope GME plays out for the folks who bought in more expensive!",ToTheMoon1337,6,/r/stocks/comments/lancov/im_completely_sick_of_seeing_gme_and_amc_posts/glpnb9h/,0.024,0.812,0.165,0.9775

703,AMD," Two caveats, one small one big.

Small: AMD has always had quality problems with their software, drivers, and firmware, especially on the Pro graphics and compute products. This means that even with superior hardware, AMD may not be the best choice for buyers.

Large: Fab capacity. AMD is reliant on TSMC for product delivery, and with Intel and Apple both moving production into TSMC, the ability to meet demand is even more limited. Product shortages can torpedo sales. We are already seeing this with graphics card shortages globally, and the anemic rollout of the next gen consoles. Demand for chips with smallest gates far out straps production.

Further, Intel's fab problems run deep, due an idiot CEO who hasn't been properly investing in Intel's in house fabs, putting Intel at a direct competitive disadvantage. Intel is likely to seek more fab capacity at TSMC for 5nm and 3nm because they are incapable of doing it themselves without investing billions to catch up.

704,CEO," Two caveats, one small one big.

Small: AMD has always had quality problems with their software, drivers, and firmware, especially on the Pro graphics and compute products. This means that even with superior hardware, AMD may not be the best choice for buyers.

Large: Fab capacity. AMD is reliant on TSMC for product delivery, and with Intel and Apple both moving production into TSMC, the ability to meet demand is even more limited. Product shortages can torpedo sales. We are already seeing this with graphics card shortages globally, and the anemic rollout of the next gen consoles. Demand for chips with smallest gates far out straps production.

705,AMD," You're correct people are angry, but these issues are affecting both GPU competitors and both consoles, so it's not really going to hurt AMD more than NVidia.

What is notable is Nvidia's yields suck because Samsung's 8nm isn't as good of a node and won't clock as high as they need it too (Ampere is way off the efficiency curve) TSMC just doesn't have enough factories but is expanding.

TSMC's issue is more solvable than Samsung's.

Also we need to throw these tariffs in the bin, you can't make any electronics product without China or Taiwan being involved in some way. That's where most PCB's get made.

Edit: You can debate tariffs being good if there is a desires non-tariffed competitor, but there just isn't in this space so they hurt everyone.",detectiveDollar,8,/r/stocks/comments/laulsh/amd_complete_stock_analysis_price_target/glqungf/,0.15,0.829,0.022,-0.9636

So arm will eventually kill off x86 (ive been saying this for about 10 years and we're starting to see it happen now with apple) AMD has licensed arm for a few years and if if they are able to release some good high performance ARM chips for desktop they will do well.

If you're new to trading and you lost on GME, this is a good time to reflect on how easy it is to get sucked into a narrative when it plays in your favor. Emotional investing is going to destroy you. But remember this is only a moment. Money is replaceable but you are not. A lot of people got burned because they don't know a single thing about trading besides what the guy next to them is saying. They start believing in the misinformation and any shred of confirmation bias and they attack each other for not believing. They are downvoting and banning anyone who goes against the narrative.

There was such a rally on Wednesday across the world, and then the big spike early Thursday morning up to $480+. At that point, it was like winning the lottery. I was seriously dreaming of quitting my job, or at least retiring a couple decades early. And that feeling of a chance having slipped away, and knowing you're stuck with the daily grind for pennies in comparison. Feels like wasting my life.

You never know whether a stock will rise or fall and we all knew GME is an extremely volatile stock in particular. Nothing was guaranteed.

But it's that _perfect_ fucking timing of the buy restrictions that tanked the price. It was unbelievable.

991,GME," no. and the other word for noble intentions is *greed*.

because the system was already ""rigged"" and to some extent it is so in order to protect traders from gambling addictions or stupid moves during fomo.

also, these feelings you describe are to be expected in trading but more so in *gambling*. markets literally move on greed or fear. its about emotions of the herd.

I tend to think that if we are experiencing emotions as you describe, it is our internal system warning us that we are out of our depth. the simple cure for emotional reaction in trading is - *good education* and *proper trade management*. then you dont suffer emotional confusion so much because you dont trade on ""emotions"" you trade on earned/learned knowledge and you never put yourself in a position to lose everything.

the difference here is that this seems like the ""rigged"" system that we had come to trust, just broke for a moment. people lost money (more people will soon). so maybe there is some validity in feeling what you say you are feeling, but I certainly dont feel it myself other than the reaction I felt when it first wobbled on Thursday because the system was about to break and that would leave us all on the hook.

The *fear-greed emotional cycle* is also the nature of trading and if we cant handle it then maybe we should not be in it? harsh but fair.

I see the backend market is adjusting now, and saving a massive disaster. bravo the market makers tbh!

I hope that off the back of this -

1. they dont ban margin trading for retail traders, because if GME crashes and everyone loses money, they might.
2. we continue to see transparency occur as it has from the big boys at the back, but that we continue to be allowed to play the game anyway. hell, I was doing fine until this incident. chaos is not of benefit to us traders in the long run. nor is socialism or smashing the casino. but regulation is.

Wallstreetbets winning millions and crashing hedge funds would likely shut the casino down. the casino is not the problem and never was, it is a nice, safe regulated place, the issue is degenerate gamblers and people rolling in drunk with fomo. I think it better they lose than the casino, unless you want to end all trading on principle or something.

personally I think your feelings are misguided, but then I never trust ""feelz"" anyway when it comes to trading. almost the opposite infact, I trust knowledge and good trading practices. you lost 0.63% to learn a great lesson about your emotional reactions. cool.

994,GME," I feel the same way, and actually am up like 1000% after closing my positions today.   


I'm a long time WSB member, got into GME around $20. Got caught up in some of the swings last week - sold at $90, bought back at $140, added more at $350. I was trading in two accounts, so I need to do some accounting, but all in all, I still made an incredible profit. However there's two things making me feel awful, and I imagine it's the same for a lot of others.  


1. The concrete feeling of losing money, whether actual losses or just losing a significant amount of unrealized gains. I originally had 1100 shares that I panic-sold at $90. After buying back in, I was left with 300 shares, so I spent most of the week thinking about how much more I could have. I then decided I would be out at $500 or Friday (1/29) whichever came first, but then when Friday rolled around, I didn't sell, thinking the worst was over and it would keep climbing. However, I think the big one is....
2. Seeing how blatantly the game is rigged against us. Right before the halts went into place on Thursday, the stock was going parabolic. I genuinely think that Thursday could have been the squeeze that everyone had been envisioning, with prices going well over $1000. And then in a matter of seconds, the rules completely changed. This is something that really makes me sick - these Wall Street hedge fund managers already have more money than anyone needs, and yet the game is still completely tilted in their favor. They never have to face real consequences when they're wrong with their investment theses, but we do. And they don't even need the money. If GME had gone to 10,000 and bankrupted these firms completely, the people who shorted the stock would still walk away with more money than you or I will ever have. I think this is really the most sickening part of it all. The manipulation was so blatant, and they will all walk away from it unscathed.",AncientTurnip7,2,/r/stocks/comments/lam8fb/anyone_else_just_feeling_this_really_bad/glrb3ov/,0.107,0.826,0.068,-0.9678

The game certainly is rigged for some players, I don’t think folks realized just how bad it was until last week. The feelings he described aren’t a symptom of gambling, it’s hopelessness as a symptom of coming to a realization that something you thought was fair is not so fair and you’re on the loosing end and no one that can fix it wants to fix it. It’s not about money it’s about equality.

Luckily, you have a choice to play the game and the safer you play the game the less rigged it seems. 

Also, OP clearly says his vibes are not due to loosing or the loss of money. OP can clearly empathize with those who put significant money into GME and that’s why he’s feeling this way and so he sees what’s soon to come for them.

1024,DD," I wanted to make a similar post, but I guess I’ll leave it here.

I just go out this morning at $150 and got in at $38. I made a $37k profit. If you had told me 2 weeks ago I’d make that amount of money on single short-term trade, I’d have been ecstatic. But I’m pretty disappointed in myself.

I’m mostly a fire-and-forget kind of guy and usually hold a position for at least a couple of years and I’ve beaten the S&P 500 with minimal risk for years, so this type of trade isn’t something I do because I’m convinced you can lose big. I, however, only put what I was able to lose into this.

When I first stumbled upon GME, WSB seemed to have great energy, great people with good to decent DD every day. So I stuck with the program. But something last Thursday changed and I am kicking myself for not noticing. It started turning into an echo chamber, if you weren’t totally convinced that GME would hit $1k you were a shill and even worse if you dared to bring up another ticker. It’s kinda like watching your hair grow every minute - it’s so slow and gradual you don’t notice your free fall into lunacy unless you step back, which I failed to do. Glued to WSB, 24/7.

I kept trust in people saying “no way they covered, short interest still high!” or “volume too low, can’t possibly have covered”. In my line of work, I would never have taken this line of thinking at face value and would have looked at such claims with heavy skepticism. But here I was, being stupid. I can so easily come up with reasons why those two things were stupid reasons to hold GME now. Of course, short interest isn’t 0, because new shorts keep coming in at a higher price and aren’t the original players from the start of the play. Of course volume was enough for them to have covered given the high volume last week. I almost got trapped by these $800 calls that came out last night but posts in here changed my mind. I should have bailed Friday at $320, I’d be up $100k.

I will get over my disappointment in myself and ultimately be happy I added $37k to my portfolio, which is decent at this stage of my life. I felt shackled for a couple of weeks and this is weight off my shoulders, I have OCD, and with that comes an obsessive personality. My wife thought I was a lunatic. I am happy that I learned a lot about situations like these, however, we might never see another GME to employ a better approach. If something like this happens again, I will absolutely take part of I’m early enough but be my own person and not a WSB nutjob on meth.

More concretely, here are things I learned or had reinforced:

* you absolutely have to get into these trades early, once it gets out, you’re late. I was lucky. 
* sort by controversial on r/WSB and look at the actual level-headed DD there, had I done this Friday or even yesterday, I’d have cashed out earlier. Some posts in there convinced me after hours to sell. 
* cross-reference r/stocks and r/investing for opposing viewpoints
* step back and ask yourself if you’re a victim of the echo chamber but not seeing it since it’s slow and gradual
* be skeptical of certain theories that keep you holding I.e. volume is too low for them to have covered, use your actual brain, I’d be fired at my job if had not questioned those, this is where most of the disappointment lays 
* ⁠the big boys have tools at their disposal that you don’t, are better at this than you, and have access to information you don’t, you can’t compete over the long-haul 
* get away from your phone, quality information and discussion doesn’t come as fast as you want to consume it. You start filling that void with garbage, I.e. refreshing the GME daily discussion thread every minute, there is literally nothing of value in those threads

And finally, I am sad about WSB, I was learning a lot until it went to shits. There was genuinely good energy and good people providing good information. I think it’ll be ruined for a while with people chasing the high or looking for another quick buck. We’ll see.

This was cathartic.

1031,AM," I'll tell you my story real quick.

I bought in December at 13.6 I think was the exact number, 100 shares, peanuts at the time.

I rode it up on the Ryan Cohen train, loved it, wanted GME to go up and benefit from it and be the stock it should be (I had a book/speculative value of 75-100).

We then got the first boost for the new board members and I was thrilled, I thought that was the squeeze at first but realized that it was only the beginning, my friends didn't believe me and didn't buy in (they regret it now clearly).

But then things started accelerating volume and volatility started going wayyy up and media started to notice, then we had the second huge boom to 60+ which was stated as a gamma squeeze or just more squeezing, loved it. That Friday I played online poker with my friends and was like this things going over 100 and I could feel the momentum. Even told my wife which is rare I usually don't like boast about gains.

Then the squeeze week started, last week. You guys know the story, by Tuesday night my friends were like are you serious? We had the musk tweet, every subreddit was blowing up, the AH was in the 300's, I thought ""Tomorrow is the squeeze"".

And it was, well the next few days were. My shares traded from 30k to 40k to 30k and my wife comes running upstairs, ""WHY AM I HEARING ABOUT GAMESTOP ON THE NEWS"".

It went fully viral, grandmas, dads, kids, everyone was buying in, WSB gained like 2 million members overnight. I sold 80 shares on Wednesday and I thought I would regret it, but I don't.

Thursday it was way down and I didn't care, I was holding the rest because diamond hands and whatever. Then Friday it was back up and I started really thinking I can't go thru the weekend holding this, it's a complete dice roll.

1032,GME," I'll tell you my story real quick.

I bought in December at 13.6 I think was the exact number, 100 shares, peanuts at the time.

I rode it up on the Ryan Cohen train, loved it, wanted GME to go up and benefit from it and be the stock it should be (I had a book/speculative value of 75-100).

We then got the first boost for the new board members and I was thrilled, I thought that was the squeeze at first but realized that it was only the beginning, my friends didn't believe me and didn't buy in (they regret it now clearly).

But then things started accelerating volume and volatility started going wayyy up and media started to notice, then we had the second huge boom to 60+ which was stated as a gamma squeeze or just more squeezing, loved it. That Friday I played online poker with my friends and was like this things going over 100 and I could feel the momentum. Even told my wife which is rare I usually don't like boast about gains.

Then the squeeze week started, last week. You guys know the story, by Tuesday night my friends were like are you serious? We had the musk tweet, every subreddit was blowing up, the AH was in the 300's, I thought ""Tomorrow is the squeeze"".

And it was, well the next few days were. My shares traded from 30k to 40k to 30k and my wife comes running upstairs, ""WHY AM I HEARING ABOUT GAMESTOP ON THE NEWS"".

It went fully viral, grandmas, dads, kids, everyone was buying in, WSB gained like 2 million members overnight. I sold 80 shares on Wednesday and I thought I would regret it, but I don't.

Thursday it was way down and I didn't care, I was holding the rest because diamond hands and whatever. Then Friday it was back up and I started really thinking I can't go thru the weekend holding this, it's a complete dice roll. I started looking into all the posts on WSB, whose commenting etc and what was the short info.

1034,RBC," Got in at 21 for 250 shares.  I never bought into the squeeze play until the WSB exploded with it.  my intent was if i make 2x on it by the end of the year, i'd be happy.  however, the events of thursday and friday clouded my judgement.  first, on thursday at market open, i was wanting and ready to dump all at 400+ and call it a day  and make 125K from a 5k invesment.  guess what? i can't freaking log into RBC Direct Investing to sell booo.  this severely clouded my judgment for a few days.

1. an hour or two into the day when i saw the price tanking, i sold 50 shares at a price of 210.  got my intial 5k back and a profit of 5k -- excellent -- probably the best decision i've made during this frenzy
2. on friday when it rose back to 300-325 --- i for some stupid reason didn't want to sell thinking that it would rebound back to the 400 range to sell on monday.  boy was i ever wrong.  damn my greed
3. so today, i start selling, 50 @ 120, then 100 @ 109 - i should have dumped it all at 120 and get the fuck out...why am i still attached?
4. i have 50 shares left, which i am just gonna sell and get it over with and enjoy the gain.

i was able to get out with a gain. but i am salty because of the loss of the unrealized gain due to market manipulation and my greed.  however, that loss and teach me a very valuable lesson.

1. have a proper exit strategy...when to take profit

I was actually going to exit once it hit $100s, since I entered in around the mid upper 2-digits. Then when it went well above $100, I pretty much held out of the adrenaline rushes. Once it hit $400 I thought about cashing part of it to cover my costs, but was very convinced it could keep going, especially given DD. The issue is DD is very subjective, never though RH would pull such a stunt, but figured it could rebound. After it never rebounded, basically saw it slowly drop, even during after hours, until it was near my cost basis. 

Thankfully got back my money and basically just made a few $100s out of it, but truly have feels for people that lost $1000s, and even more feels for what could've been. The sad part is I'm convinced most of us only lost or underperformed, because of the rigged system with Wall Street. Think knowing how it was lost, was much more emotional than actually losing.

1045,AGI," Let me weigh in here as someone who is licensed to do taxes.

There are 3 types of taxes to talk about with stuff like this; Federal, State, and Local.

Local - Most people don't have this and don't have to worry about it. Some bigger cities NYC, etc. do. The rate at which your local tax rate is varries.

State - Most, but not all have this. Again works similar to Federal in a lot of ways they just allow or disallow some things to be recognized as income or deductions. For example the way NJ calculates Medical Expenses is different from the Fed so you have to recalculate it. State rates vary.

Federal - Gets all the talk. There are two calculations here, above the line and below the line deductions. The line they're referring to is your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). In general, you want to prioritize your above the line deductions if you're able to as you are then able to reduce your AGI which tends to be more beneficial. 

Now the boring basic stuff is out of the way some more boring math.

Income - 963,000 (I'll assume they contribute to a 401k)
Deductions - 24,000
Exemptions - 0

Taxable Income - 939,000

Regular Taxes - 286,809
Alt Minimum Tax - 0
Additional Taxes - 6,416
Tax Credits - 0
Tax Payments - 6,417 (Job contribution probably)

You Owe - 268,808

Marginal Rate - 37%

There are a ton of assumptions I had to make to make that calculation so as with everything it's not a one size fits all.

That Quarter of a Mil is just Fed. Now you add in State and Local and you may have take home much closer to 550k depending on how unforgiving of a place you live in.

All this is a very long winded way of saying don't make your business decisions based on the taxes you owe, but do talk to a tax professional as early in the year as possible so we can come up with a strategy to minimize your tax burden.

Year 1: $50k realized short term gains. But you reinvested the full proceeds back into something new and cross into a new year.

According to the IRS, you owe taxes on that $50k gain from year 1 even if you happened to lose that entire gain in year 2. You could go from +50k to -100k in year two, and still owe taxes on the prior years $50k gain. The year 2 loss won’t offset the prior year’s gain, even if that loss is greater than your year 1 gain.

1084,GME," There's no expiration for the shorts. Why do they need them? 

The interest? That's yearly so the big players are paying like 10 million a day or something in interest. Isn't that peanuts compared to closing out their position and paying $1000+ per share like WSB wants them to? 

What about the hedgefunds that shorted the stock when it hit $300 to $500 at the end of last week? They made a killing Friday and today. They don't need the shares.

Look, I don't mean to push you or anything. I was holding GME till this morning. Me reading up on stuff, getting a different perspective changed my position. Just ask yourself this stuff, man.

There's half the short positions now than there was a week ago (based on S3 partners). Let's say half of these shorts came in when the price skyrocketed to $200, $300, $400, and $500. That means only half are hurting with the price at $180. Really, a quarter of the total amount that existed last Monday. Demand is way down.

1086,GME," The report by S3 partners is just an estimate, and one I personally believe to be inaccurate. The volume doesn't match the original % shorted. Relatedly, Melvin Capital claimed they closed their 30M of positions on a day when the total volume was 50M. You can't honestly tell me you think Melvin Capital was 60% of all trades made that day. 

Yes, there's a possibility of over-the-counter trades being made, vut I don't know enough those about to factor them in.

Paying $10 million a day in interest is something hedge funds can keep up for days or weeks, but certainly not months. It's not a sustainable rate of loss in the long term, so they absolutely do need the shares. They'll make some money back from their recent shorting from the $500 spike, but eventually they need a hell of a lot of shares. When that time comes, I'll be ready.

***Signs of a pyramid scheme:***

1. **To make money you will be required to sign up other people:**

Big tick. This short squeeze strategy requires everyone to buy and hold their stock. People are going onto social media and talking to their family, friends, coworkers IRL to get them to buy GME stock. It is also becoming increasingly obvious that there is astro-turfing from both sides, and a lot of effort is being put into controlling the narrative.

**2) The scheme involves selling goods and services of little value:**

No-one would say with a straight face that GME is worth $1000, $500, $200 etc. Even DFV bought in long expecting it to get to maybe $30. But the line is currently '$1000 is the minimum' or 'we literally choose the selling price' despite absolutely no fundamentals to support that.

**3) There will be an upfront joining fee or large initial investment:**

Yep, $30 for the WSB faithful, $300 for the 90% who joined in the past week.

**4) You feel strong pressure to remain in good standing with the group:**

If you hold, you're praised into the depths of financial oblivion - this is love bombing. If you sell for a ten or hundred bagger, you're abused with all manner of names. Anyone who advises against taking part is called a shill or a bot. Any business taking measures to not completely disintegrate is accused of being part of the conspiracy. Any piece of shit can praise the group like Belfort and he's immediately a hero.

**5) There are zero requirements to joining, the opportunity is unmissable:**

Yep. Anyone can open an account and stick their savings into GME. They're told by millions that there's no way this can go wrong, it's free money.

**6) There's a cult-like nature to the in-group:**

BIG yep. All the 'monke' shit, all the 'diamond hands' shit, all the 'DFV is our god' shit. Now you add on the 'this isn't about the money' and it's the biggest sign to me that someone has cultivated GME for a purpose. Step 1: pump money, Step 2: get everyone else involved, Step 3: get out while everyone else is holding, Step 4: they don't know or care what just happened because you convinced them the initial reason to join (make easy money) is unimportant and the real goal was something bigger (stick it to the hedge funds). Note: I am NOT saying DFV or any other individual did this on purpose, but I do think there are big players who haven't come forward and who benefit greatly from having millions of people willing to baghold down to $20.",Barkasia,28,/r/stocks/comments/laqopg/rstocks_daily_discussion_technicals_tuesday_feb/glq9179/,0.044,0.85,0.105,0.9641

1350,GME," I just closed my position at a $2,750 loss. I bought 25 @269 and the loss of today was past my tolerances. 

I was watching GME on these subs since early January but didn’t have the time to invest.  I missed out and took a 30% loss. 

I don’t know if “the squeeze has been squoze” because of all the contradicting data and the echo chamber of WSB. 

I have a lose theory though. Wall Street has done and is doing illegal things to get themselves out of this predicament. Market manipulation, media, counterfeit shares, all of it. Unfortunately I think retail readers will be left holding the bag. 

If the squeeze hasn’t happened then great!  I just have a bad feeling that opportunity fir 1k+ was lost when Robinhood limited trading and momentum turned. 

My consolation is that I still might hedge my doubts with a new buy-in point once the plummet has stopped.",Beerddviking626,1,/r/stocks/comments/lai51i/are_you_still_holding_gme_as_of_today/glq393x/,0.234,0.682,0.084,-0.9771

1368,VERY," Agreed with but two points;

WSB actually has some VERY insightful due diligence (however, these are buried nowadays since there’s a whole lot of newbies around).

I’d also like to add that retail investors aren’t the big players here. 

Think of WSB as the megaphone. 
The real fight’s between institutional shareholders + millionaires, and the hedgies. 

As in, they’re throwing nukes, we’re throwing pebbles.
To my calculations, DFV owns roughly 0.4% of GameStop. 

It’s easy to get lost in the euphoria of having the illusion of power but we actually are the ‘little guys’ here.

1378,DD," DD isn't something done in an hour. If you honestly want to learn how to read financial reports you need to start with Accounting 101 so you can read a P&L and Balance Sheet. Maybe you learned that in high school, but many schools don't even bother. Even then, the depth of a publicly traded company's earning reports is far more demanding than someone with a 101 level understanding of accounting. As stated in other replies, 10Ks and 10Qs are your go-to published documents... reading them may seem like a foreign language. If that's the case, Google every word you don't understand. Investopedia is your friend. DD is accumulated over weeks and months for large trades. Otherwise you are just gambling. Even good DD can be wrong, and all you can do is improve your odds over time but you'll never be guaranteed anything.

In truth, most people are better off reading someone else's analysis (a good skill is to choose the analysts you follow carefully... you have to research them as well).

1380,DD," Read the reports. present and past.

Digest the reports. Not literally. If you do that, stick to VOO. I am not an accountant or some economics guy, but I do it. I have read a few books and I am sure I make mistakes, but I also learn along the way. Things like debt, cash, dilution make a difference. Things like who is running the company makes a difference. What they say they want to happen can make a difference. How they view returning value to shareholders makes a difference. 

Look at the competitors or the closest thing to competitors.

Assert what you think a financial report will look like in 1, 5, 10 years. 

From there, you should be able to think about what pps looks like in those time frames. Even if the company executes, there are a lot of market things that can influence this. Are you going to be right all the time? nope. Even if you are right about the fundamentals of a company, the industry might change.

Due to the short interest coming in during 2020, he’s ended up with a 100x return cashed out ($13mm), while still being long 50,000 shares and 500c (another $30mm, depending on the day).

Also you should consider he got a ton of money from his second call he was holding on GME. You gotta go into his post history and see when it disappeared. He had to exercise it because it ran out.

At this point he might just be in as a moral support, believing it will actually take off or fearing what a couple million people might do if he leaves the boat. All of these are for me logical thoughts he might have.

So that said, while he could have had a ton more - if someone buys it - one was exercised and he got a huge amount out of that (call for January).

At this moment I would say Ford is in a better place to start putting claws in the EV market, but both GM & Ford have a long way to go to keep up.

There is also a question of their finances and overhead, but in this area GM is in a much better place, producing $2.296/share comparatively to Ford currently bleeding, but GM seems overvalued in this space even still.

1504,UAL," I'm betting more on UAL as American is the weakest of all US Majors.   
UAL is really at a low, and can only go up from here, it's a solid airline with a decent leadership. They're not in deep on any un logical aircraft orders (T7-X, 380, that kind of things), their gas guzzlers are already out of service and they should get rid of their 75 and 76 in the upcoming years.

I think it'd be realistic to see their stock in the high 70s by the end of 2021. However I would hold until 22/23 where my speculation says it should be back to 2019 level, so that's 150% give or take...

This naturally limits the supply of investors that are potentially interested.

1513,ARE," I think their stock will increase heavily over the next year with all other MSOs.  I have small positions in CURLF and  CRLBF as well, but I prefer GTBIF at the end of the day.  

&#x200B;

CURLF and Trulieve seem to focus on medical whereas other MSOs focus on both recreation and medical.  Seems like they're leaving money on the table.  In addition, last I researched them in March, CURLF was not big into the edibles game which I see as a fatal mistake.  Looks like they do have some edible products now which is good.  My theory is cannabis is a commodity and eventually selling flower will not be very profitable.  The companies that survive will focus on product branding, particularly of edibles.  

&#x200B;

As an example, nobody is brand loyal to a particular kind of potatoes.  But people ARE loyal to brands of potato chips.  I think weed will be the same way.  People won't be brand loyal to flower, they will be brand loyal to edible product lines.  Green Thumb's management team has specifically asserted they are focusing on product branding which I believe is a successful strategy moving forward.

&#x200B;

What I do like about CURLF is that like GTBIF, they are focusing on states with large populations that are heavily regulated.  Places like IL implement so many hoops to jump through that it makes starting a cannabis company almost impossible.  Companies like GTIBIF and CURLF will thrive in such highly regulated environments, allowing them to establish government backed monopolies.  I think this strategy is preferable to opening in places with loose regulation like Colorado.",UserNum97135,5,/r/stocks/comments/lb0i3g/rstocks_discuss_overlooked_stocks_tuesday_feb_02/glrr88a/,0.047,0.778,0.175,0.9895

1515,CRSR," My thinking behind it is they may never surpass Logitech but they are closing the gap. They are finally out of debt and have income now so they can start making partnerships and acquisitions to close the gap more. CRSR was started in 1994, went public in 2020, and have been making a lot of great moves since then. They have also increased their stock price and also projections for their future targets since that span. Logitech has been around since 1981, went public in 1997, and has been a huge powerhouse in this market for such a long time.  


My reasoning for choosing and investing in CRSR is because Logitech has already blown up as shown by their 6x market cap compared to CRSR. But CRSR is so new and has the chance to close the gap and blow up. They may never overtake Logitech but they don't need to either. The difference is so high right now but product wise, it probably shouldn't be that big. So as CRSR becomes more of a household name, hopefully it will close. And I can look back in 10-20 years and be like ""man, I'm so glad I made this jump when I did.""

I just watched Jimmy Kimmel on ABC compare the Reddit crowd to the Russians and maybe compare is the wrong word he said something along the lines of the Reddit crowd or possibly the Russians are taking down large hedge funds.

That's so weird that kind of reminds me of other things that happened like you know when Trump got elected that was the Russians.

But here on Reddit everybody's like no no we hate the Republicans we despise them and then all of the hedge fund managers all of the media pretty much everybody is on the side of the hedge funds.

So many of us doubled/tripled/quadrupled our investment, but they just laugh at us...

It's whatever but it is really disgusting. In a fucked up way, it reminds me of how kids are picked on at school and then they do some violent stupid act.

1623,ATH," Thanks for the explanation, a few questions - 

I hadn't discounted the possibility of new shorts entering in place of the old shorts, but doesn't that mean they would have to cover? I know that the possibility exists of them entering at a much reasonable price of say $300, which makes it a lot easier to ride out the interest rates.

On the note of volume though, I am assuming the old shorts have to cover at least some millions of shares at whatever price point since the original short position was over 100% of the outstanding shares. Wouldn't that ride the price up over the ATH even by a bit? Also the volume these past few days have been miniscule so that is something to be looked at as well.",726f626f7431,2,/r/stocks/comments/lak74v/confessions_of_a_short_seller/glp6tbt/,0.008,0.804,0.188,0.9791
1624,GME," 1. New shorts do not have to cover until they get margin called or decide to cover. To be margin called they would need to see the price go up to a few grand. If the price stays at similar levels they will just pay the interest on the borrowed stock which is at 30% annually as of now. It is much better for them to cover this interest for a few month and wait until the price goes down. The payoff would make sense because the borrowing rate will be decreasing as short interest decreases.

2. You are correct in the assumption that some would need to cover. Some would not if they opened a long position, because they would be able to sell the long position to not get margin called. The ones who are forced to buy back and return the shares sometimes do it over the counter, meaning not on public exchanges. The ones that did do it ok public exchanges definitely contributed to the price going up, but it is hard to say by how much. The gamma squeeze that happened last Monday/Tuesday was a much bigger factor in the price increase. 

 I can’t speak on the volume per say, because I don’t have insight. But just now that yes, if you compare the volume to last weeks highs it might seem low, but even today there was more volume in GME then in Microsoft and Tesla. This is plenty of volume to cover any outstanding short positions, but they would most likely not cover today, since they are not getting margin called (the price went down). The only reason they would cover is because they made enough money and are happy with the position they are in.",MichKOG,1,/r/stocks/comments/lak74v/confessions_of_a_short_seller/glp7i4q/,0.024,0.873,0.103,0.9738

The quality of their peripherals are lacking and I fear as they diverge into more and more product lines that there just be a point where the R&D cannot match what competitors who have a strong ground hold in their category can offer.

1760,GME," In the US you need to have some sort of legal margin on stocks to ensure people can exit positions (not entirely sure why though though it’s likely to cover exit strategies)

Looking at pre market data GME is down 40% and will likely to continue falling as many people exit there investments. 

As a stock becomes more volatile the margins % increases. It increased by 250% today meaning that clearing houses don’t have enough margin to support purchases.

It’s a pain in the backside but it’s likely showing that today’s going to be a rough day on the stock markets

My trading platform is also saying it’s unable to comply with the 250% margin also as there executor can’t comply with it today.

1784,AMC," The growth potential is high with the more recent contracts they have developed, but whether that growth is translated into stock value has yet to be seen. They are a backdoor firm, working behind the scenes for other companies that are already worth far more then themselves. Should these new partnerships increase the overall evaluation of the company, we may see an increase. Hold where you are though. Best I could see is an increase to the high 20s or low 30s. Other analysts are calling it the next 65$ stock but I dont see how the value can grow that large with the jobs they are doing. I am sure you will make the money back, you just may need to sit on it for a few months. 

To answer your other questions:

Stop Loss is a way to protect yourself from losing. Typically its used when you are up; say you bought at 15 and its currently at 18. You dont want to sell now because it may still be goint up but want to ensure you make some profit incase it goes down. Set your Stop Loss at 17 so you still profit 2/share, but you can still sell when its at 18 if you feel its stagnant/going to go down. 

Limits are very helpful when you are buying. I have been setting my limits about a dollar or two less than open because as of late, stocks are dropping for the first two hours following open and then gradually increase between 1030-130. Say a stock opens at 15 and you are expecting that decline before the hype of the market picks up. Set your limit to purchase at 14 so you get in during the dip and slowly watch where it goes from there. In todays climate, limit purchases of BB and AMC have been fruitless as the stocks so volatile. Limits wont be the best bet as the stocks are going to fluctuate immensely throughout the days and weeks.

Porsche had announced an interest in increasing it's stake in VW, but what investors didn't know is that Porsche was able to stake another ~43% undisclosed to the public. When they saw the short interest get that high, Porsche made a press release announcing that a week before then they had increased their stake in VW to ~74%. So suddenly between Porsche and Saxony, 94% of shares are locked up. Less than 6% was available for trade, I've seen it mentioned that it was potentially closer to 1% of the stock was available for trade once you include other German investment funds.  

So literally overnight investors went from a manageable short position, to there literally not being enough shares available on the open market, and Porsche basically holding all the cards with 74% ownership.

There was a scramble to get shares, and Porsche squeezed the investors.

This was a calculated move by Porsche (which ultimately didn't really pay off long term, in 2009 VW had to bail Porsche out), compared to a ""movement"" by a bunch of individuals that are playing a game of prisoner's dilemma. Over 60% of GME is held by 10 investment funds (Fidelity and Blackrock holding the largest stakes). Retail is playing around with with the leftovers. A squeeze (if last week wasn't already *the* squeeze) is possible, but it's been way overbuilt (like $5000/share being an inevitable reality). Retail doesn't have anywhere near the position Porsche had.",SexHarassmentPanda,1,/r/stocks/comments/lagfqg/why_did_the_share_price_of_vw_dip_right_before/glpxsob/,0.014,0.892,0.094,0.9669

1819,UK," RYCEY Rolls Royce, aviation branch based in the UK (not the car manufacturer) , hit an all time low these past couple of weeks due to the announcement of $2.4 billion outflow. They're the 2nd largest aircraft engine manufacturer and the 16th biggest defense contractor in the world. They also manufacture marine engines and install power generation systems. Since Covid hit, they've been taking a beating due to limited air travel but are poised to make a good comeback as soon as the world gets over this pandemic. 

Around $1.40 a share right now, I believe this stock could get back to normal if not more as soon as normal air travel resumes as early as late this year or next. 

On that note, aviation in general could be good stocks to look into as everyone in the world is going to want to fly off for family and vacations as soon as we can. It could be a great couple of years for aviation stocks, the only issue is not knowing when.",,3,/r/stocks/comments/lagano/what_have_you_bought_this_past_week/glnua7g/,0.027,0.856,0.116,0.9542

1871,CO," Unpopular opinion, but hear me out...

For one, I don't think federal legalization is necessarily imminent. Maybe farther out on the horizon, but it'll be a few more years.  And if/when it happens, Uncle Sam is going to want his cut too, which will drive (already high) dispensary prices up more.

Federal legalization won't = legal sales in all states.  It'll allow for interstate commerce (which will crush the little guy) and allow them to use banking.  Some states will continue to outlaw cannabis.  

The state I live in isn't legal.  I have friends/family in CA, MI, IL, and CO that smoke.  Every single one of them buys their shit from a dealer just like we do here.  The dispensaries are a novelty at first, but often time end up catering to old people and new residents that don't have a hook up yet.

1912,TRXC," TRXC my very long thesis ....but you asked 

My latest investing interest is a little company called transentrix $TRXC.  This is a small medical device company that makes a robotic surgical system called the senhance system.  This is a system used for robotic assisted laparoscopic surgery allowing surgeons to perform surgery with small incisions, less tissue manipulation, increased control and less surgical variability.  

While robotics in surgery may seem like expensive toys, there are several reasons to consider their adoption amongst surgeons.  Firstly, surgery often involves long hours of standing and use of the surgeon’s hands which can cause fatigue, surgical robots would reduce this.  Secondly, surgical robots can largely replace surgical assistants thereby reducing surgical costs. Thirdly, surgeons during traditional laparoscopic instruments are allowed limited access by their instruments, robots are not limited in this way as articulations can be added to instruments to facilitate surgical access.  

The largest and best known company in this space is intuitive surgical who makes the DaVinci surgical robotic system.  This system has an installed base of approximately 5000 units as of 2020.  Which vastly outnumbers the number of senhance systems installed by transenterix, however there remains, in our opinion, significant room for growth as robotics in surgery has not yet been widely adopted in many regions.  However, progressive forward looking surgical training programs will likely start incorporating training with surgical robots thus bolstering demand amongst graduating surgeons.  These surgeons will likely request the same instruments they used as residents and having already trained with them they will feel comfortable sticking with what they learnt on. 

I have 2 main bull cases for this stock:

	1.	l see a large runway for robotic surgery in general.  As new surgeons are trained they will be looking to robotic assisted surgery to improve patient care.  We believe transenterix could be positioned to capitalize on this.
	2.	With a market capitalization of $364 million, while not the screaming deal it was even 3 months ago, may represent a reasonable value.  This company has a fully functioning robotics system which has been approved for use in the USA, and has just received clearance for use throughout the Russian federation and in Japan. 

The bear case:

	1.	Transenterix is a relatively small company which is competing with companies with much higher market capitalizations and much more money at their disposal such as intuitive surgical and Medtronic.  Once surgeons learn to use one device it may be hard for them to switch.
	2.	It has become somewhat of a hot stock recently resulting in a significant run up in price.  We often get concerned when prices run up this quickly that they often drop again to a more reasonable level.  Furthermore the company is not yet profitable. 

In summary, TRXC is an interesting company in a very interesting space.  They have fully functional surgical robots with reusable components, unlike most of their competitors which may make them more attractive.  The price was a definite bargain only a few months ago but the recent price run up makes it less so, although at this share price the company has issued more shares to give further liquidity for further operations.  I am long TRXC but would have to think carefully before adding further to this position at this price. 


TLDR: Robotic assisted surgery is in its infancy.  We see a long runway for this domain.  Just as ultrasound was once new tech and price prohibited wide spread adoption but eventually became standard of care in many specialties I see robotics taking the same path in surgery.",Investingwifey,4,/r/stocks/comments/lb38wt/what_long_term_investment_stocks_are_catching/glrmcu7/,0.019,0.904,0.077,0.9811

1970,GME," I could be wrong here, so please feel free to correct, but the comparisons of GME at VW aren’t accurate because most of the float of VW was held by another car company. ~70% held by one company.

With GME, 70% of the stock was held by several different companies, many of which either (a) made deals to sell shares directly to the Shorts or (b) had to sell GME as it was flying to $300 because the meteoric price rise caused their portfolios to be grossly out of balance.

So in VW only ~ 30% of float wasn’t locked up, but in GME probably ~ 30% is locked up by retail and insiders.

It’s great that you are actually asking question instead of sounding like a brainwashed fanboi. But I think the question to ask is what % of the float has changed hands already.
