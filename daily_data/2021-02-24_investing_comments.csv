0,IMO," Hopefully Congress could pass a bill this year. IMO 2021 is the only window for the Dems to squeeze through legalization. It would also be in their benefit to do so. If polls can be trusted, MJ legalization is widely supported by the public, and arguably needed after a whole year of COVID-induced stress and medical conditions.

If the Dems want to keep their seats (and gain new ones) in the midterm, then they better hustle this year so legalization can be a key point in favor of electing a Dem over a Republican.",517UATION,250,/r/investing/comments/lr34do/the_us_cannabis_industry_play_is_more_attractive/gojqff3/,0.046,0.751,0.203,0.9393

15,DEA," US Cannabis legalization is not as simple as people think.

The Psychotropic Substance Act of 1978 was amended to align with the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of the UN. 


Meaning, the Drugs on Schedule 1 are there by treaty and as Article 6 of the Constitution makes all treaties the law of the land, we would need to seek out to amend the treaty at the UN before we can remove Cannabis from Schedule 1 in the US, or get permission from the UN to downgrade it. Which is likely a tough battle.


Cannabis legalization is often teased by government leaders as a means of distraction or placation during turbulent negotiations or intense partisan battles.


Interpol was originally created to pursue violations of the drug laws after WW2. The DEA soon followed for the purpose of doing the same, which is why the US always seems to ""police the world"", because we agreed to.",user0001001,2,/r/investing/comments/lr34do/the_us_cannabis_industry_play_is_more_attractive/gol6hbp/,0.093,0.873,0.034,-0.8591

32,USA," Cronos (CRON) - big tobacco's Altria (MO), the largest tobacco company in USA, backs this company with 45% ownership and will likely plug and play its products like a light switch into its huge point of service network of over 250,000 locations (i.e. convenience stores, etc) is the cannabis company that will likely be the ultimate winner. They are avoiding expensive growing methods by using a creative approach announcing the other day that they will be introducing synthetic cannabinoids for the Canadian market for a jaw dropping 10 cents a gram:

https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/cronos-to-sell-lab-grown-pot-products-in-canada-this-year-ceo-1.1556188

Aside from Cronos, I think the ancillary cannabis companies are the way to play weed stocks because they don't contain cannabis and hence allow listing on the most liquid exchanges such as Nasdaq and institutional money can pour into these cannabis related names now/today as opposed to being shut out of other companies that contain cannabis because institutional money usually has mandates to not allow investing in something that is Federally illegal:

Hydrofarm (HYFM) - IPOed in Dec and a leading hydroponics manufacturer and distributor

GrowGeneration (GRWG) - leading hydroponics retailer

Agrify (AGFY) - recent IPO and a hydroponics growing solutions services provider

Weedmaps (SSPK) - unique cannabis play on the intersection of tech and cannabis. A type of Uber, Amazon, Yelp and Shopify all rolled into one for cannabis products. A SPAC that will turn into WeedMaps during sometime in the 1st half of this year. This one is special. 

Tim Seymour's cannabis ETF (CNBS) owns a big position in WeedMaps and smaller positions in GrowGeneration and Hydrofarm:

76,SP," If you work for the federal government and hold any sort of security clearance you aren’t supposed to invest in weed because it’s illegal at the federal level. This would probably only come up upon initial investigation or a security renewal, but I do know some guys that I work with that had some weed stocks and they were told to sell them when they came up on their 10 year review. They were given 30 days to sell them in order to keep their clearance.  

The funny thing in researching this, is is it sort of a gray area. There is no actual DOD policy that says you can’t have weed stock, however if the person investigating you decides to make it an issue you’re going to have to sell them. It’s so stupid. Also anyone who is invested in the TSP (fed version of 401k-so basically all feds) is already invested indirectly in the industry anyway, as Altria is on the SP 500.

105,SQ," Its being traded as a derivative for BTC right now. If you want to ride the BTC wave but you aren't comfortable with wallets and small exchanges, you might opt to buy SQ ... and conversely sell when BTC is selling.

You might also hedge a position in BTC by shorting SQ or buying puts.

Finally, since the vast majority of BTC use is still just speculation, a steep drop in price might bring an end to this speculative wave and could really hurt SQ's BTC business.

Those are all short-term effects. A long term holder might like the stock still b/c it is an early adopter of BTC and should be able to develop expertise and services in cryptocurrency and blockchain more broadly that could make it a massive growth story on a 10 - 20 year timeframe.

It has some major advantages over the banks. Banks have alot of physical capital stock that sucks up their growth capital and they are saddle with legacy tech and regulations that make it difficult for them to implement new technology.

143,DOW," I can chime in here as a person with a significant scholarly interest in political economy and Marxism and how it impacts investing. 

If China had the same regulatory policies as the US then without a doubt the ROI on Chinese investing generally would be dramatically greater than the DOW. The problem is that it isn't, and China's ""Socialism with Chinese characteristics"" is a dramatically different socio-economic system than American DOW capitalism. Marx/Engels reasoned that in order for a society to able to sustain a worker owned and managed economy where the profits of businesses go back to the workers (titled lower-stage communism or ""socialism"") it requires a high level of productive capacity and total wealth during its capitalist stage. China's leadership in the late 1970s recognized this theory and was influenced by it, and began to allow foreign investment and some moderate forms of capitalism to build the nation's wealth. This has obviously worked extremely well for them so far.

If the theory is taken at face value, then it means either the workers of Chinese businesses or the Chinese government will at some unknown time in the future take total control of all Chinese businesses to begin the transition to a socialist economy. That means any investments in China you have will disappear. If the theory is not taken at face value, and you argue that in realistic terms China's leadership is paying lip service to Marxism, has long since transitioned away from Marxism, and its economy and/or government is directly/indirectly run by a capitalist class not unlike the US then your buy and hold investment is **maybe** in a safer position. The problem is even if we accept this theory it's totally uncertain if China will become a US style economy, as they are currently highly suspicious of monopolies and value antitrust practices. The recent events with Alibaba and its dips and volatility is one such example.",Moontouch,2,/r/investing/comments/lrj5wg/the_biggest_growth_narratives_for_china/gomp4l8/,0.044,0.851,0.105,0.956

157,AMC,"  

Status Update: I finally reached Stash Costumer support -> They charge $75 for an ACATS. Which explains they sold the stock. I do find it veeeeery interesting that they decide to sell AMC and TSLA instead of, for example, selling a bit % of each to cover the fee. (Of course, they didn't ask me which to sell, nor to sell on my own to cover the fee, nor to charge the fee from my checking account). Also, Stash doesn't say anywhere that they'll sell your stock to pay for this $75. I mean, they could have pulled the fee from my checking account!

\---------------------------------------  


So I decided to switch to TD Ameritrade, and asked them to make a Automated Customer Account *Transfer* Service (ACATS) from Stash to TD Ameritrade.

The result is the following: My TSLA was sold entirely, and half my AMC was sold as well, without they even asking me or letting me know.

I should add for sake of clarity, I received on TD Ameritrade's end cash that supposedly is equivalent for the stock that was sold. However, that is not the point: my stock is worth today more than the cash they have handed me.

Anyone has any idea why this might had happen? Of course TD Ameritrade says it was done on their end, and Stash denies any involvement.

A little research on my own leads to the following: TD Ameritrade only allows whole securities (i.e. 1 stock of TSLA). That would explain why Stash sold my .58 TSLA before the transfer. However, doesn't explain why 4 out of my 8 AMC was sold!

And also doesn't explain why I wasn't notified about this before any selling operation happened so I could decide how to proceed on this!

Anyone has any idea why this might had happen? Of course TD Ameritrade says it was done on their end, and Stash denies any involvement.

A little research on my own leads to the following: TD Ameritrade only allows whole securities (i.e. 1 stock of TSLA). That would explain why Stash sold my .58 TSLA before the transfer. However, doesn't explain why 4 out of my 8 AMC was sold!

And also doesn't explain why I wasn't notified about this before any selling operation happened so I could decide how to proceed on this!

I'm going to get to the bottom of this. AMC and TSLA are going up today which makes it even more infuriating.",m_castaneda,1,/r/investing/comments/lr95cf/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/golt7bo/,0.025,0.922,0.053,0.7706
159,TSLA,"  

Status Update: I finally reached Stash Costumer support -> They charge $75 for an ACATS. Which explains they sold the stock. I do find it veeeeery interesting that they decide to sell AMC and TSLA instead of, for example, selling a bit % of each to cover the fee. (Of course, they didn't ask me which to sell, nor to sell on my own to cover the fee, nor to charge the fee from my checking account). Also, Stash doesn't say anywhere that they'll sell your stock to pay for this $75. I mean, they could have pulled the fee from my checking account!

\---------------------------------------  


So I decided to switch to TD Ameritrade, and asked them to make a Automated Customer Account *Transfer* Service (ACATS) from Stash to TD Ameritrade.

The result is the following: My TSLA was sold entirely, and half my AMC was sold as well, without they even asking me or letting me know.

I should add for sake of clarity, I received on TD Ameritrade's end cash that supposedly is equivalent for the stock that was sold. However, that is not the point: my stock is worth today more than the cash they have handed me.

Hello all, I am currently rebalancing my portfolio and was wondering if my allocations are right. Just FYI I am 31, M, single, and have substantial investments in another country than the US for some reason. Let's call this country 'K'. I should also add that I am planning to FIRE at 40 and would not be reproducing.

50% Stocks - out of which 70% US and 30% K.

25% Funds - out of which 60% US, 20% K, 20% International (Excluding US and K)

25% Cash - 50% US, 50% K.

This results in overall 60% US, 35% K, 5% International.

A few details:

**Stocks:** Most of my stocks are either blue-chip, tech, or big well-known companies. I am not the sort of guy who invests in stocks that are 'in fashion, cool, or sexy'. You can say I am a bit conservative (or maybe call me a boomer lol idk). For example, a big chunk of my US stock portfolio comprises MSFT, AAPL, CRM, NOW, AMZN, QCOM, SBUX, and a bunch of banks in small quantities each.

**Mutual Funds:** *US:* Mostly invested in Index funds like VIGAX (Growth IF), VFIAX (S&P 500 IF), VIMAX(Mid-Cap IF), VSGAX(Small-Cap Growth IF)

*International:* VFSAX (Small Cap Non-US IF), VTIAX (Total International IF)

*K:* 3 Index Funds covering 3 Cap types.

**Cash:** After a certain limit (i.e. emergency funds), I keep cash in instruments that yield me around 6% return annually. No lock-ins.

Here are my major questions, however, feel free to add anything that comes to your mind, all suggestions/criticism welcomed.

1. How does the portfolio look in terms of risk allocation? Am I being too conservative?
2. Am I invested too much in Index Funds and lesser in stocks?
3. Is my international exposure (excluding the US and K) too less?

Thanks in advance!

Hello all, I am currently rebalancing my portfolio and was wondering if my allocations are right. Just FYI I am 31, M, single, and have substantial investments in another country than the US for some reason. Let's call this country 'K'. I should also add that I am planning to FIRE at 40 and would not be reproducing.

50% Stocks - out of which 70% US and 30% K.

25% Funds - out of which 60% US, 20% K, 20% International (Excluding US and K)

25% Cash - 50% US, 50% K.

This results in overall 60% US, 35% K, 5% International.

A few details:

**Stocks:** Most of my stocks are either blue-chip, tech, or big well-known companies. I am not the sort of guy who invests in stocks that are 'in fashion, cool, or sexy'. You can say I am a bit conservative (or maybe call me a boomer lol idk). For example, a big chunk of my US stock portfolio comprises MSFT, AAPL, CRM, NOW, AMZN, QCOM, SBUX, and a bunch of banks in small quantities each.

**Mutual Funds:** *US:* Mostly invested in Index funds like VIGAX (Growth IF), VFIAX (S&P 500 IF), VIMAX(Mid-Cap IF), VSGAX(Small-Cap Growth IF)

*International:* VFSAX (Small Cap Non-US IF), VTIAX (Total International IF)

*K:* 3 Index Funds covering 3 Cap types.

**Cash:** After a certain limit (i.e. emergency funds), I keep cash in instruments that yield me around 6% return annually. No lock-ins.

Here are my major questions, however, feel free to add anything that comes to your mind, all suggestions/criticism welcomed.

1. How does the portfolio look in terms of risk allocation? Am I being too conservative?
2. Am I invested too much in Index Funds and lesser in stocks?
3. Is my international exposure (excluding the US and K) too less?

Thanks in advance!

198,TSLA," I'm interested in modeling how TSLA will pop so that I can invest in options.

For mature companies and indexes, I can predict the future direction of the markets with any level of certainty (NOTE: If I were to make a 100% certainty prediction of the S&P 500's movement in 3 months, it wouldn't be of much value, because the range would be too large).

Anyways, I would like to get an idea of how TSLA will pop based on how other stocks burst. I can't simply use TSLA's historic day-to-day growth or week-to-week growth because the last 6 months are an aberration. Moreover, if I were to neglect the effects of the last 6 months, and applied the upperbound and lowerbound growth rate of TSLA, it would still be misleading, because the future prices is a still TSLA's price 6 months ago extrapolated based on it's pre-aberration growth rate.

Maybe, I can, indeed, do what I've stated above, and take this as being the future price of TSLA (i.e. by ignoring the last 6 months, and just extrapolating based on how it's historically done prior to 6 months ago, and coming up with a range of possible future value).

200,TD," Hey guys,

So, I have minimal experience with Target Dates. My jobs historically only had Index Funds for their 401K that I would split 75/20/5 US/Intl/Bond. From 2018 until the end of 2020 I had a job that basically only offered a target dates and I picked the 2065 one (wanting to be aggressive, I'll retire earlier) that I invested. It did nothing but lose money every year with 2020 being the lowest loss at about 1%. I feel you could have thrown darts at a board, invested on whatever it stuck, and made returns in 2020. I dont see how you can possibly lose 3 years in a row, but they managed it.

Now I'm super cautious of TD funds. I also see international tends to lag behind US, so im retaining my original 75/20/5 I had going on in my other funds. I guess the major risk here being the US stagnating for years and not repeating the 80s-10s recoveries.

Should I be considering the Target Date so it can rebalance automatically for me later (as well as be more ""safe"") vs me having to sell what I hold to rebalance and having taxable gains outside of my 401k and ROTH (both are maxed, so I have a brokerage account for the rest)?

I think initially they did, but a lot of sales shifted off-premise - maybe not in every case enough to make up for loss of restaurant sales, but a surprising amount. You also saw some direct-to-consumer alcohol services (wine club Naked Wines in the UK, whose stock has done quite well) take off. If I was going to buy alcohol stocks right now I'd probably look at the European names (Pernod, Remy, Diageo) or Brown Forman in the US. Constellation is fine and they have the exposure to cannabis with Canopy, but they've made some mis-steps at times (most famously the purchase of Ballast Point for a billion dollars, which they eventually sold for some people estimated between $75-200M (but probably on the lower end of that.)

You don't need to be trading every week, nevermind every day.

Highly unlikely that the math would still work out that buy ATH beats buying all of those dips - and those were just the general indices dip.

283,AM," Fair question. Firstly, I will say I am by no means an economist nor a seasoned investor so my opinion/outlook shouldn't carry much weight.

With that said, Why is the dip from the last week days unnatural.

I would classify an unnatural dip as the market over reacting to a negative catalyst. What has happened from the 4/5 days prior to today I would classify as unnatural due to the fact that the only negative catalysts were a steadily rising 10 yr treasury yield, stimulus talks dragging, and the fear of rising inflation rates.

Those catalysts alone forced a large amount of stocks in EV and Tech/Growth to fall off the guts of 30%, I personally think that is absurd. 

On Tuesday morning my whole watchlist (Tech, Crypto, SPACs) was down 15-20% in Pre-Market trading, it was then further dumped until they all bounced back up around the same time which was around 9:40 AM, to trade side ways for the most part and then recover well AH and today.

In my opinion, those catalysts were not nearly enough to qualify that kind of pullback market-wide, even undervalued Tech stocks were pulling back, it was un natural in my opinion due to these reasons. This is further suggested by how the market has recovered today, and how basically every single stock bounced at the same time yesterday after a massive sell-off at market open.",AmberLeafSmoke,1,/r/investing/comments/lr960w/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/golvcko/,0.085,0.879,0.036,-0.9153

285,ATH," No shit you can cherry pick moments to say ""had you waited to invest you'd have made money"" but if you can just predict the future you don't need to ask Reddit how to make money.

If you think securities appreciate and cash depreciates - which has been true for as long as those things have existed - then hold cash instead of securities is a losing strategy mathematically.  It's as simple as that.  Sure, if you think you can time the market, do something else, but you in fact can not time the market, and any positive variance you achieve by doing so is due to luck.

Even what you're referencing - like the 4% drop in late January, that had $SPY trading at the price it was at _earlier in January_ which was an ATH.  Had you purchased $SPY _literally any point in the past prior to start of 2021_ you'd have more value.  The 7% drops in Oct & Nov last year put $SPY all the way back down to the price it was at in August of the same year.  If you decided when $SPY hit it's (at the time) ATH in June after bouncing back from COVID and went to DCA instead of Lump Sum, you'd see $SPY literally has not dropped below that June ATH since.

If anything 2010's bull run has STRENGTHENED the argument that Lump Sump investing crushes DCA because stock gain has been so consistent.  Literally the only window where there was enough pullback to have made waiting to invest succeed was the COVID bottom in the last decade.  The whole rest of the decade was just steady growth.

OP is talking about DCA over a _2 year_ period, if you think the cost basis on whatever he buys is going to be better DCA vs. Lump sum I don't know what to tell you, but enjoy taking a set of shears to your returns because you suck at math.",pWheff,1,/r/investing/comments/lr960w/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gom9j06/,0.055,0.794,0.151,0.9905

323,ANY," Since you asked for input, let me give you my thoughts on your points.  

Disclosure: I'm a Tesla investor but don't consider myself a fanboy.  I will happily invest in other auto companies if I see that they will be competitors to Tesla.  I also invest in related ETFs like IDRIV and ARKW to broaden my portfolio in this sector.  

>GM recently announced it’s targeting a full lineup of zero emission vehicles by 2035 

That is a LONG way off.  If it actually takes GM nearly 15 years to make this transition they are dead.  I believe we are on the inflection point of the S-curve in terms of EV adoption, at least in the developed world.

* Prices are coming down
* The number of charging stations are going up.
* Range is going up.
* Brand selection going up

EVs are safer, more fun to drive (generally), have far lower maintenance costs, have higher resale value.  By 2030 the majority of passenger cars sold globally will be electric, GM needs to push back that 2035 date to something much sooner.

> They already have the Chevy Bolt 

Ya, it's ok as a competitor but not sure GM is making any money on these.  It's only real benefit is that it's cheaper than a Model 3 up front but I doubt the TCO is lower (if you also factor in resale value).  

I think the Ford Mach E is actually a much better vehicle and a bigger rival for Tesla.

>The Hummer EV is, I would argue, the single most desirable EV scheduled for imminent production. The specs are insane and it looks beautiful inside and out. Pricing will obviously keep average buyers out, but it’s a tremendous halo car and reservations for the top trim level were claimed almost immediately after they went up. 

I have to disagree here.  The most desirable EV is probably the new Tesla Roadster.  Look no further if you want to see insane specs.  I'm not sure what specs in the Hummer you are so excited about.  The highest level trim has 350mi of range and costs $113K.  For half that price ($69K) you can get the triple motor Cybertruck with 500mi of range.  You won't even be able to by ANY Hummer for that price, the cheapest one will be $80K, won't be available for years, and only have 250mi of range.  The specs don't impress me.

I get it, the CT is not everyone's cup of tea.  It's a stark departure from the normal pickup and that will keep a lot of traditional truck buyers away.  However, I think given the specs, price, and utility they will sell very well.  

Also, Rivian will have something that looks like a traditional truck but with better features.  I also think it will cost less than the Hummer.  If Atlis can make the XT with the given specs that will be a solid competitor as well.  

The Hummer will be a low volume vehicle, it's just too expensive and the specs don't match the cost.  The thing does look crazy awesome though, and has some interesting features (crab walk, underbody cam) that will appeal to a few.  

> The Cadillac Lyriq

Sure, looks great.  Let's wait to see if and when it actually hits the street, and at what price.

>They’re an established auto maker that makes quality vehicles under trusted brands. 

Not sure that is actually a benefit.  It's easier in many ways to be a pure play EV company than trying to pivot a monster like GM.  Also, suppose that GM starts to make successful EVs, will that come at the expense of Tesla or will they simply cannibalize their own ICE sales? 

>They’re targeting dramatically less expensive battery packs that will be 40% less expensive than what they use in the Bolt and are projecting 60% less expensive for gen 2 

Targets are great, but they are rather light on details on how they will get there.  They, like all other incumbent auto companies, are buying cells from third parties.  There will only be so many to go around, and all major players are ramping up the EV business.  Will Panasonic, LG, and CATL have enough to supply so everyone can build cars or will there be another 'chip shortage' type constraint?  

Tesla is the only company that has laid out how they plan to scale batteries.  They already own the biggest battery factory in the world, and are working on a high speed method to make purpose-built cells for electric cars (the 4680).  They will be mining and processing their own lithium and building two new battery factories (in addition to the pilot line in Freemont).  The 4680 certainly appears to be superior to any other battery tech available, and will also become part of the structure of the car.  This type of vertical integration is just not possible with any other brand.

>They’re targeting a 450 mile range for some vehicles (I’d guess sedans competing with the Model S) 

Tesla will be >500mi this year.  GM is just ""thinking"" of getting to 450miles.  By the time GM gets there, Tesla will already be another two steps ahead.  

>Their Super Cruise autonomous driving tech (currently exclusive to Cadillac) is arguably superior to Tesla’s 

Sure, I'll argue that.  Super Cruise is great at driving on any of the pre-mapped highways with relatively good conditions.  In that situation, maybe it's even better than Autopilot (based on what I have seen with the new beta I doubt that is even true though).  The problem is that it doesn't work at all on surface streets with traffic lights, road signs, or in parking lots, etc.  Tesla is actually trying make an autonomous driving car, one that will eventually reach level 5.  GM is far behind in that effort.

>Am I crazy to think GM could be the real EV winner? 

The EV winner?  I think so.  That doesn't mean that GM won't be around for decades selling EVs.  I just don't think all of the players will successfully make the transition.  The auto market is huge, and in 20 years there will be many auto companies selling EVs.  GM could be one of them, but today I think they don't have a clear path to that destiny.

324,EV," Since you asked for input, let me give you my thoughts on your points.

>GM recently announced it’s targeting a full lineup of zero emission vehicles by 2035 

That is a LONG way off.  If it actually takes GM nearly 15 years to make this transition they are dead.  I believe we are on the inflection point of the S-curve in terms of EV adoption, at least in the developed world.

* Prices are coming down
* The number of charging stations are going up.
* Range is going up.
* Brand selection going up

EVs are safer, more fun to drive (generally), have far lower maintenance costs, have higher resale value.  By 2030 the majority of passenger cars sold globally will be electric, GM needs to push back that 2035 date to something much sooner.

> They already have the Chevy Bolt 

Ya, it's ok as a competitor but not sure GM is making any money on these.  It's only real benefit is that it's cheaper than a Model 3 up front but I doubt the TCO is lower (if you also factor in resale value).  

I think the Ford Mach E is actually a much better vehicle and a bigger rival for Tesla.

>The Hummer EV is, I would argue, the single most desirable EV scheduled for imminent production. The specs are insane and it looks beautiful inside and out. Pricing will obviously keep average buyers out, but it’s a tremendous halo car and reservations for the top trim level were claimed almost immediately after they went up. 

I have to disagree here.  The most desirable EV is probably the new Tesla Roadster.  Look no further if you want to see insane specs.  I'm not sure what specs in the Hummer you are so excited about.  The highest level trim has 350mi of range and costs $113K.  For half that price ($69K) you can get the triple motor Cybertruck with 500mi of range.  You won't even be able to by ANY Hummer for that price, the cheapest one will be $80K, won't be available for years, and only have 250mi of range.  The specs don't impress me.

I get it, the CT is not everyone's cup of tea.  It's a stark departure from the normal pickup and that will keep a lot of traditional truck buyers away.  However, I think given the specs, price, and utility they will sell very well.  

Also, Rivian will have something that looks like a traditional truck but with better features.  I also think it will cost less than the Hummer.  If Atlis can make the XT with the given specs that will be a solid competitor as well.  

The Hummer will be a low volume vehicle, it's just too expensive and the specs don't match the cost.  The thing does look crazy awesome though, and has some interesting features (crab walk, underbody cam) that will appeal to a few.  

> The Cadillac Lyriq

Sure, looks great.  Let's wait to see if and when it actually hits the street, and at what price.

>They’re an established auto maker that makes quality vehicles under trusted brands. 

Not sure that is actually a benefit.  It's easier in many ways to be a pure play EV company than trying to pivot a monster like GM.  Also, suppose that GM starts to make successful EVs, will that come at the expense of Tesla or will they simply cannibalize their own ICE sales? 

>They’re targeting dramatically less expensive battery packs that will be 40% less expensive than what they use in the Bolt and are projecting 60% less expensive for gen 2 

Targets are great, but they are rather light on details on how they will get there.  They, like all other incumbent auto companies, are buying cells from third parties.  There will only be so many to go around, and all major players are ramping up the EV business.  Will Panasonic, LG, and CATL have enough to supply so everyone can build cars or will there be another 'chip shortage' type constraint?  

Tesla is the only company that has laid out how they plan to scale batteries.  They already own the biggest battery factory in the world, and are working on a high speed method to make purpose-built cells for electric cars (the 4680).  They will be mining and processing their own lithium and building two new battery factories (in addition to the pilot line in Freemont).  The 4680 certainly appears to be superior to any other battery tech available, and will also become part of the structure of the car.  This type of vertical integration is just not possible with any other brand.

>They’re targeting a 450 mile range for some vehicles (I’d guess sedans competing with the Model S) 

Tesla will be >500mi this year.  GM is just ""thinking"" of getting to 450miles.  By the time GM gets there, Tesla will already be another two steps ahead.  

>Their Super Cruise autonomous driving tech (currently exclusive to Cadillac) is arguably superior to Tesla’s 

Sure, I'll argue that.  Super Cruise is great at driving on any of the pre-mapped highways with relatively good conditions.  In that situation, maybe it's even better than Autopilot (based on what I have seen with the new beta I doubt that is even true though).  The problem is that it doesn't work at all on surface streets with traffic lights, road signs, or in parking lots, etc.  Tesla is actually trying make an autonomous driving car, one that will eventually reach level 5.  GM is far behind in that effort.

>Am I crazy to think GM could be the real EV winner? 

The EV winner?  I think so.  That doesn't mean that GM won't be around for decades selling EVs.  I just don't think all of the players will successfully make the transition.  The auto market is huge, and in 20 years there will be many auto companies selling EVs.  GM could be one of them, but today I think they don't have a clear path to that destiny.

327,GM," I think the issue becomes when something hasn't been the leader in anything much for a long time, saying that they are going to suddenly be the winner requires a considerable amount of imagination/hope. For a while people were hyped up on GoPro. They thought that the company was going to do well in drones. The company hadn't even done well in cameras, so what - if anything - was giving anyone confidence that they would do well in drones? The drone was delayed, recalled and then they got out of the drone business. 

Tesla has done as well as it has in part because they've sold the story superbly well. The industry does not have another salesman in the manner that Musk is, does not have anyone as promotional as Musk is, etc. etc. etc. and it shows. I think there's something to the idea of storytelling with investing and if you can't sell the story to the customer you're not going to do well selling it to shareholders. People can think what they want about Tesla, but it does enjoy a cult following and has raised considerable money and those equity raises were practically *welcomed.* If Ford/GM did an equity raise, I don't think it would get the same reception.

This was my thought when reading the headline.  GM doesn't make good regular cars right now, what makes us think they're going to make market leading EVs?

From a segmentation standpoint I think GM can probably do well enough in the basic staples segment.  Like if you want an EV and can't afford the TSLA then sure, GM makes sense.

But it'll be the same story as GM is currently - nobody goes out and buys a GM because it's the most desirable car in a segment (outside of certain performance cars).  They do it because it's cheaper than most competition and still reasonably reliable.",MasterCookSwag,3,/r/investing/comments/lrg3d2/gm_as_the_future_king_of_evs/golr3be/,0.017,0.866,0.117,0.9059

346,GM," Super cruise, however, does not require an orange to go hands-free.

As I said, the Hummer is a halo car. It’s not for the masses, but rather an embodiment of the company’s aspirations. It packs in some truly exciting tech which you will see in more affordable cars in time.

I’m not saying it’s impossible that Tesla wins out, but I see a lot more execution risk for them moving forward than I do for an old standard like GM.

348,GM," And I cant read your post as more than wishful thinking and denial of the their position in the market.

There is an electric vehicle stock bubble going on right now, and GM comes out and says ""trust us guys, we will be fully electric in 15 years"". How does that statement mean anything, all these people in Senior leadership wont even be at the company in 15 years.

They come out and release a model of a flying car. Anyone with a fairly advanced understanding of energy density and physics knows that flying cars are never going to be a commercial thing, but GM is doing it anyway, because why not.

All these actions are nothing but ways to pump the stock short term.",seank11,9,/r/investing/comments/lrg3d2/gm_as_the_future_king_of_evs/golmwqo/,0.0,0.957,0.043,0.4939

Objectively we have no data strongly suggesting GM cars will be more desired than Tesla or any others. We have no objective data that their autonomous software will beat or evolve faster than Tesla's or others. Etc. etc.

If it was so obvious and had data backing it they're stock would be through the roof already but there are way too many variables to assume with confidence they'll be the market leader ever.",Wloak,1,/r/investing/comments/lrg3d2/gm_as_the_future_king_of_evs/gompjp5/,0.051,0.86,0.089,0.5714

GM's timelines imo are way too slow. I think with how fast battery prices are falling that EVs will catch on a lot faster then most experts are predicting, especially in the new car market (which is the market that matters for GM).

Also have you seen the sales of the GM Bolt? While it's the best selling non-Tesla EV in the US, their sales are still pitiful compared to the numbers Tesla is putting up. From what I've seen the Bolt isn't actually that bad of a car, the big problem with it is the GM logo.
