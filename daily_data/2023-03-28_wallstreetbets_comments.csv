51,OC," Meh, not OC. I don't mind the ingredients per se.

But the mRNA vaccine is really not good. The lipid nanoparticles (LNP) coating travels past organ barriers (to the brain and other organs), and the production of free spike proteins can cause autoimmune disorders by binding to your organs, causing your immune system to think your organs were one big virus.

A classical adenovirus or viral vector won't travel past organ barriers and would also pose less risk of your immune system thinking your organ was one big virus, because the attack would be localised to the adenovirus itself.

That's why there were plenty of news and research about autoimmune developments due to the mRNA vaccine. The principle of the technology itself is great, but the specifics of it are not so great (using LNP that passes organ barriers and using free spike proteins that can bind to your organs).

That's why they're using LNP to treat brain disorders - because the LNP can travel to your brain, when normal vaccines couldn't.

Edit: You can search this up, but here's one of the studies: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8402065/#:~:text=Lipid%2Dbased%20nanoparticles%20can%20pass,and%20effective%20manner%20%5B35%5D.&text=Different%20brain%20delivery%20strategies%20showing,intranasal%20delivery%2C%20and%20systemic%20delivery.

99,FRC," You still got c.85% of your capital you can save by closing this trade. Just take your loss and get out before you get nothing!

FRC is going down. The treasury secretary already said they won't extend the deposit insurance to all banks and only do that on a case by case basis as they did for SVB after it failed.

Your options if you hold from here are 3:
1. The shares keep going down until the bank's equity run out and the FDIC takes over - which means you get zero cents!
2. The shares keep falling down and FRC becomes so cheap that another big bank decides to purchase it for pennies (a similar case to Credit Suisse) - where you get pennies!
3. A miracle happens where interest rates fall and the bank's liabilities falls which puts the bank in a much better CET1 position - seems very unlikely given the high prevailing inflation. Even if that was to happen, FRC has lost public trust and deposits are likely to continue flowing out. So even if it survives, it won't reach the previous price levels anytime soon.

132,IMO," Very well said, been trying to inform people on here about these possibilities for a while, as well.

The dirty truth is that a lot of people on here don't even trade or discuss real plays, and just participate in the trolling.  A lot of the names that used to trade are no longer here and some who are here went cash in 2022 and only sometimes disclose that they aren't trading, just taking part in the trolling for entertainment.

Of those who do trade and are vocal, many are people who joined just to mirror plays and strategies. A few weeks ago when the bond market inverted its behavior, the daily thread was awash in people who were mirroring dollar-correlated or bond-correlated plays who got washed out and surprised and thought the market was wrong and being manipulated when it was really a signal we entered a new stage in the bear market (a higher risk stage)...but what's really interesting is that bull steepenings also happen when there's no crash.

Now that's interesting and you can build plays around it, and people used to do that on here... but there's so much macro uncertainty right now that I think people shy away from that to some extent.

I don't want to lambaste the sub too much, there are still lots of people who are decent and want info and are curious and open minded... but there's a large body who are so binary in their thinking that any discussion has to be boiled down to ""team crash/team rally"" because this is a team sport replacement to a lot of people on here, and just like lots of armchair quarterbacks in sports, many of the screamers here don't actually understand the market.

Or worse, there's a cadre of people here yelling for a crash as a political argument or ideological argument... which in my mind is worse. Wanting a country to crash so your party can benefit or so you can feel ideologically reinforced and inflict pain on others for that reason is basically indefensible IMO.

But people on here don't understand concepts like institutional capital flows, index re-weighting, and idle capital pools so that's also where a lot of the simply directional biases come from.",Moist_Lunch_5075,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/124kmrd/stop_rooting_for_a_crash_regards/je0y5yw/,0.116,0.797,0.087,-0.9275

157,AKA," >Op said “debt system” so I assume he says about both

Perhaps.  For my part, I am okay with personal debt, but I would absolutely abolish fiat currency, the federal reserve, and the fractional reserve banking system.

>personal debt system without federal reserve lender-of-last-resort mechanism is just waiting for another Mother of All Financial Crisises AKA Great Recession when private lenders will inevitably screw something up and lend too much.

You have it exactly backwards.  The federal reserve is the safety cushion that allows big banks to lend way too much on a regular basis, because they know the fed can bail them out in the event of a collapse.  When banks have to worry about total failure and executives take on personal risk, they become a lot more cautious.  Funny you should reference the Great Recession, when that example works entirely for my position and against yours.

>Debt system is not some all you can eat buffet,

It literally is.  We could pass a constitutional amendment tomorrow requiring the government to have a balanced budget each year.  

>Also not sure where exactly the idea of “tangible assets only” prevents federal debt.

It doesn't, but it greatly limits the amount they borrow.  They can no longer simply borrow an infinite amount of money from the future.  They have to borrow real assets from the present from parties that believe they will be able to pay them back on time.

Debt is not a binary.  It is a sliding scale.  It is possible to use a modest amount of debt to jumpstart growth and productivity.  However, what we have now is a debt monster that is devouring our entire economy and extracting most of the value of our labor right out from under us.  It is long past time to reel this monster back in.

>as government regularly did before the invention of central banks

That is a good thing.  A government that has to worry about bankruptcy is a much more cautious, typically less violent and oppressive government.  There have been several compelling arguments made that WWI was only enabled by the establishment of fiat currency, since the participating governments were only able to finance the war by borrowing from the future.  Without it, we may have avoided the bulk of WWI and subsequently WW2 entirely.

Management-wise, the Tmall ecom unit (having the biggest revenue by far) would remain under direct Alibaba operation, while the other 5 will have their own mgmt structure. If we assume some of these units spinoff to IPO, existing BABA shareholders would get shares of those spinoffs (wondering how that maths out).

This looks very bullish for BABA, because as the chart shows, most of the units have major growth on the table and are now freed up from the undervaluation the whole group suffers from.

I'd also venture to say that Amazon holds itself back from being a multi-trillion dollar conglomerate because it's all under one roof, same as BABA was. Could be BABA is also thinking of this, and I think AMZN will certainly take a lesson from what happens to BABA over the next few years. I am very bullish, long term, on both stocks.

168,BABA," Definitely not a coincidence. China already made him pay the price of his little speech a few years ago before he ever went abroad. They had him locked up or house arrested, stomped the Ant group IPO, added regulations onto Ant, gang banged the fuck out of Alibaba & the big techs with fines and fees, made sure every investor got BTFO, and then the CCP got their hands on ""golden shares"" which basically give them 1% or so of ownership but likely over 50% voting power which would include board seats, insight in to daily activities, and business decision power. The last thing is very stupid since they just showed they could do w/e the fuck they wanted even without the stupid golden shares, but I guess Xi likes killing less and putting up appearances more than Putin.

Breaking Alibaba up might seem bullish but could also be bearish if seen as further ""punishment"" from the CCP to Ma in the form of publicly dismantling his empire. CCP loved that shit from the OG days. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struggle_session One reason to suspect this is that Alibaba is getting broken up but no such news about Tencent. Could also be another move to screw BABA foreign investors if you're bearish about it since it's going to be a lot of hoops and regulations to jump through. What if each spinoff is spun off as a Hong Kong listing at a very low price where investors get stock or equivalent cash? Then a western investor without an account that can hold HK securities will basically get robbed.

It might be viewed neutrally or bullish if we're looking at the CCP economy not doing so well and wanting to boost their economy. Xi's everything crackdowns and 2022 lockdowns were dumb af and really hurt the economy (but at least it made sure no one could contest Xi's 3rd term!!!). The Chinese people didn't tons of stimmies like in the US and they are having trouble restarting their economy. Meanwhile foreigners and investors are spooked and don't want to put money in after what they saw. So the CCP has been trying to undo the damage Xi himself did for the sake of Xi's 3rd. Alibaba is now seen as a posterchild and reminder of Jack Ma speaking out and how even the safest companies in China can't be trusted making it the best sample case of how ""all Chinese stocks are un-investable"". CCP can sort of patch that up by breaking it up so you can't so easily see it. 

The bullish view would be the same as above but the CCP also fixing it by pumping it back up to $250+ but I doubt they'll do that. Maybe they think it's easier to break it into pieces for the CCP or potential investors can pump each part individually rather than Alibaba as a whole? Jack Ma returning to China also probably at the demand of the CCP to shore up foreign investor confidence in China, Chinese system, and Chinese economy.",zxc123zxc123,14,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/124m0dz/alibaba_to_split_into_6_units_and_explore_ipos/je15to5/,0.136,0.778,0.086,-0.9842

Easier for turds to go up in value. I would actually argue the splitting of BABA is extremely bullish this decade for Chinese markets.

We love new and original content here on WSB.

We have no tolerance for basic templated memes, reposts from the front page, or boomer memes.

Yes, this can be a little subjective at times, but we want to show you the best WSB has to offer!

If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!

A few tips though!

* Don't just submit a chart of the current price. Come on. Google only costs $5 per search. (wait, you guys are searching for free?)

* Reaction gifs are *fucking lame*. Put that shit in a comment, no one wants to look at your face in real life anyways so why are you making a thread about it.

* Don't repost stuff. All of us are terminally online, how dare you try and make us laugh with an image posted somewhere else. Jokes aside, we don't want to beat a joke to death, so give us some fresh OC and we'll be a lot cheerier.",wallstreetbets-ModTeam,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/124sxlw/decided_to_listen_to_my_gf_for_once_and_sold_4k/je1ywf7/,0.072,0.731,0.197,0.9702

BABA options fills are absolute GARBAGE at open— quotes take forever, volume is low, spreads are wider than your wife’s legs while giving birth.

There’s also a LOT of fuckery in terms of price action, so be patient. Also, this news hasn’t been processed by the HKSE, and BABA moved lower during their Tuesday trading session. This might pump the rest of the week as a result of that, but I’d sell a good chunk of your positions and maybe let a few ride.

Rare metals usually go through cycles. Check out CME and past super cycles. Uranium is and always will be a nothing burger because again it’s not difficult to mine or source - just to store. 

Having said all that - if you think you want to invest in Uranium buy the commodity / future contracts and NOT miners. 

Miners are rarely profitable / usually have accounting or operational issues that eventually get makes via mergers and buyouts. 

Again.

548,CNK," Q1' 2022 was a disaster in terms of box officer revenues so comparing to that is not great. Also Q1' 2019 was the worst of the 12 quarters in 2017-2019 so not really a great mark to compare to.

For the YOY calculation, using Q1 as a base for the calculation is problematic as there is little reason to assume the increase you noted for Q1 will apply to the rest of the year. For one, as noted already Q1' 2022 was unusually bad, perhaps it lacked any worthwhile movie releases. Second, looking at 2017 and 2018, Q1 results were in-line with the average for the year so there is no trend to assume later quarters will be better. Continuing that thought, Q1' 2023 should be about 1.760B in revenues which if it will be average for the year would be only about 7B in revenue for the year, which would be a disaster.

There is a reason most analysts assume box office revenues will be substantially off pre-pandemic levels (not 15% like you say, but much more) and will not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024 or 2025 (assuming they ever do return).

In my opinion I don't think the market will look favorably at CNK anytime soon. Barring some unexpected changes this stock is going down.",aka0007,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1243ki2/coming_soon_to_a_theater_near_you_the_box_office/jdxurn3/,0.079,0.875,0.046,-0.7631
549,CNK," >It's no surprise that CNK is doing well given the current state of the box office. With so many people stuck at home with nothing to do, going to the movies is one of the few forms of entertainment available. I expect their stock price to continue to rise as more and more people return to theaters in the coming months.",VisualMod,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1243ki2/coming_soon_to_a_theater_near_you_the_box_office/jdxkquk/,0.067,0.828,0.105,0.3687
550,CNK," Even if the overall box office came in at 20% over 2022 totals (which is a very conservative estimate), this would have the US surpassing pre-pandemic levels in 2024.  CNK yields about 30% of that market share which has been growing since the beginning of the pandemic. On the contrary, the market is not only looking favorable at CNK — it’s up 59% since Jan 1st.",Mobay_Luv,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1243ki2/coming_soon_to_a_theater_near_you_the_box_office/jdykevo/,0.038,0.904,0.058,0.089
