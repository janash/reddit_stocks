0,BC," Considering that there is pretty much no good option on recycling larger lithium batteries, this is pretty huge news.

I work in the battery industry (small company in BC, Canada), and a sticking point to help us push lithium in even replacing lead acid batteries is the lack of recycling options for disposal.

This could accelerate lithium use in North America.",B_Bau,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/nkouht/abml_american_battery_metals_corporation_and/gzexkdc/,0.064,0.734,0.202,0.8689

4,BK," while I do feel for you... at this point, there is not likely to be any more downward movement. Right now pps represents an opporunity for new investors to come in, and for those with the mental/emotional fortitude to ride out a storm, or even average down before we take off again. 

I can easily see us back where we were at the all time high of .0270, but more likely between .10-.20 once the dust settles on the current round of acquisitions. If they can secure the contract for the big time solar deal in California for Smartguard, or a huge Puerto Rico contract one their gov't is out of BK, or major US Gov't/military orders, then we could see anywhere between .40 - .65....

61,LOVE," Aside from the legitimacy of this offer they are talking about, environmentally friendly oil & gas extraction is a new and hot area at the moment. Contrary to popular belief the oil & gas sector LOVE patented tech as well as tech that makes the process more safe and environmentally friendly. I've been in Oil & Gas for over 20 years in manufacturing so I see this every day. All it takes is a bigger fish to notice that your product is beneficial or disrupting their market share and they will try to swallow you up. The patent is somewhat your safeguard against the larger fish taking your tech however sometimes they try to work around the patent. When this happens it actually becomes beneficial as well because the market gets larger in areas the small company could not get access to in the first place.

63,GNUS," Absolutely love this company!

Definitely a solid long term play, CEO (Andy Heyward) is the man! I've seen shareholders shoot him DMs and he actually responds, has alot of rights to Stan Lee's properties. Not sure how well the whole 'NFT' thing will pan out, but we will see soon!

The Kartoon channel is growing rapidly, with partnerships and collaborations with Shaq and Disney. Andy Heyward has worked with Disney for decades and has proven to be very fruitful relationship. 

I like the company, the content, the executive team and the financials. ZERO DEBT and tons of cash and partnerships to purse opportunities.

This is just my perspective, not financial advise.

I bought in around 2.50 but have been averaging down during this bear market.

Currently have 300 shares @ 2.08 a share!

65,IMO," From their 10q:

""The Company’s stockholders did not approve the proposal to amend the Company’s restated certificate of incorporation to increase the total number of authorized shares of the Company’s common stock from 200,000,000 to 250,000,000 shares. Because the Company’s stockholders did not approve an increase in authorized shares, without implementing a potential reverse stock split that would reduce the number of outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock and thereby increase the shares available for issuance, the Company may not have the ability to raise additional capital as needed to support development, regulatory approval and potential commercialization of its product candidates.""

They have a few months' worth of cash runway, had over 75% of authorized shares issued, and recently increased the number of shares issuable under employee incentive program.  So IMO this was inevitable, and has more to do with being able to do an offering than the stock price.",stompingllama,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/nkoowd/novn_is_a_1for10_reverse_stock_split_good/gzdw00t/,0.011,0.729,0.26,0.9879

67,BLI," Some important considerations — antibiotics are not very profitable. There’s a reason AZ cut the group (and actually most big pharma, though some do charity work), and there’s a reason they’re dependent on CARBx help. That said, all the power to them — I’ve met members before at conferences and they’re great people and doing important but unappreciated work.

Durlobactam is essentially an avibactam patent bust (there’s maaany out there), but if I remember correctly from years ago it had better activity and better class B coverage (synthesis at the time sucked, wonder if they improved the process). The sulbactam combo is an interesting one, since it’s also a BLI with weak antibacterial activity outside of acinetobacter. That’s to say that the duo isn’t more widely applicable to other infections, as compared to the more standard cephalosporin/BLI combo. Might get slow uptake market wise since the general practice is to reserve new agents for critical cases to slow emerging resistance.

The topo inhibitor is far more interesting (the BLI market is saturated), but again, with novelty comes reserved use. This is why CARBx helps development cost, but it doesn’t have enough teeth (yet) to support companies like this outright.

All this is to say that I’d sell on the positive phase 3 or approval. I can’t imagine they’re going to do sales/marketing solo, but if they do it’s a huge mistake (high burn, and these will be slow uptake sales). There’s a chance a partner buys, but I would expect licensing, which allows the partner to cut bait if it underperforms. SP will likely crater by 3Q-4Q post sales.

Just my opinion of course, come to your own conclusions.",syphilidactyl,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/nkw4u4/ettx_treating_multidrug_resistant_infections_long/gzfopco/,0.078,0.745,0.177,0.9861

I know the big jump is really just from a share consolidation. They didn't specify in their PR if it was a share cancellation or full blown reverse, etc. Their earnings were very solid though and they have been busy with some solid acquisitions.
