No, that's not what this is. It's not a pump. It's not all this garbage you hear on MSNBC or CNBC... it's a bunch of retards who just bet on something. Stocks are formalized betting. And we dont do smart things with money. GME was different because people were angry at wall st over their own self-serving gluttony. We've despised them ever since 2008, the mass bailout, too big to fail...

Being told ""we are increasing the price on houses and vehicles, while robbing your retirement accounts"" all the while, they knew full well they were setting up for a mass implosion of the market... they didnt care, and then cried poor and held their hands out to the govt for bailouts... while common people were homeless and jobless, due to their incessant greed. 

Then they tried it again in 2012, but the govt said ""nah, it's only been 3 years... earn some money first."" And they went back to overpricing while underpaying. We were due for a crash in 2020, but covid did that in a different manner.

Long story short, no... we dont pump and dump. We buy things that may be crazy to buy and possibly make or lose a fortune we didnt have before. That's what this place is.",Tiny_Philosopher_784,-14,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxepx3/a_quick_psa/h1eylgl/,0.123,0.858,0.019,-0.9594

This goes beyond just a single user. It can apply to a group of people. When people put up a DD that is solely based on people buying a security to get shorts to cover *we* got a problem. The whole subreddit can get in hot water for allowing it.

We have bull gang, bear gang, theta gang, kangaroo gang, and a bunch of others. This is fine. Where we get into problems is when people are grouping up for the ""squeeze."" If it's borderline I drop the hammer. If it's subtle, in between the lines, or a blurry opaque image of this hidden in the DD, discussion, comment, etc. I still drop the hammer.

160,GME," I don't normally speak here because 99% of this sub thinks they get how the market works. It's all fake, the fact it's seen real is an illusion. Big investment firms are most likely doing exactly what you are saying but in a different way. Most articles you'll read state that we, wallstreetbets are the reason for the irrational buying but in reality it's just impossible. Why? Any experienced trader knows that retail buying will never dictate price movement. Now there maybe more retail investors flocking to this forum but when GME was discovered there was roughly 1.8 million on this sub. Most came here to create memes, act silly, and invest maybe a couple hundred bucks at most. But if you look at level two data on the days where GME's price was $200+ and climbing most of the buy orders were 10k shares+. That means those buy orders were more than two million each. That's already an indication that it's not us. We hit close to 100 million shares traded by mid afternoon (forgot the day). I emailed Burry to explain this rapid price movement but I'm sure he knows there are hedge funds piggy backing off ""us"". This subreddit is simply the scapegoat, a false narrative for the world to point and blame for these price movements and it's perfect. Hedge funds add billions of dollars into a stock to pump it up (but slowly though, don't want to buy all at once, causes eyebrows to raise). Once it's up, everyone joins in, they start selling their position while at the same time simultaneously buying so price keeps increasing but primarily institutes stablization. Because if you sell large blocks of shares immediately it'll tank the price and no one will think of buying and they'll end up holding the bag. But if it's a slow sell off where it's a sell to buy ratio of 3:1 then they'll be able to get rid of their position while everyone else is holding the bag.",Flat-Passion,117,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nx2ihx/they_can_bend_us_but_not_break_us_gme_amc_bb_clne/h1djod0/,0.052,0.895,0.053,0.0688

184,AAPL," Why CLOV is just getting started

Feeling down about the direction of the stock lately? Rubbish and here is why. Take note that I have no idea what I'm doing and draw crayon charts in my spare time. Not financial advice!

&#x200B;

Looking at the current state of shares available this puppy is ready to pop off and its just a matter of time regardless if your involved or not.

&#x200B;

There are many times that people predict a massive  short squeeze and people just promote random things like naked short selling but this is not what is going on here.

&#x200B;

Let us begin with the short interest.

&#x200B;

Shares outstanding: 148.28M

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tc4kmuor2j471.png?width=417&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a204002ce04dd1642212eec53dda172e7e4e48a

24% held by insiders:

&#x200B;

[148.28\*0.24 = 35.58M ](https://preview.redd.it/2cpb1uew2j471.png?width=412&format=png&auto=webp&s=94be5b644b244611024f78b04c1c4092ac91f516)

&#x200B;

Shares short May 28th: 41.27M

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i8rkb6wg3j471.png?width=416&format=png&auto=webp&s=47667ee19ed85fa4f22ad25f0394cfd60ebc5318

shares outstanding - insider shares = 112.70M

&#x200B;

Normally we would look at this and say welp 112.70M - 41.27M = 71.43M shares floating around and this would be very difficult to force a squeeze on as GME had maybe 50,000 shares available during its last squeeze with the proper adjustments in place.

&#x200B;

However things get very interesting :)

When you look at how many shares are held by institutions the number is 106.25%

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yjw2ov134j471.png?width=293&format=png&auto=webp&s=47cb4e09df5cd1dc0b9fb20688ba4efd5ce50486

This is obviously highly irregular. Say you look up a regular stock like AAPL, you will find % owned by institutions is 58.69%, AMZN is similar at 59.32%.

&#x200B;

With this said, this implies that 148.28m\*1.0625 = 157.54m shares are owned by institutions 🤪

&#x200B;

We already discovered that there are only 71.43M shares available. This can only mean that there are 86.11M shares that are literally duplicates in some way.

&#x200B;

Investopedia explains that this could be due to a delay in updates:

https://preview.redd.it/tpwqaojk5j471.png?width=389&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a3459037db015ae822d59d6bdd6f65976c88ef1

BUT investopedia also explains that another reason can  be short selling between investors:

https://preview.redd.it/1rjkf9vo5j471.png?width=390&format=png&auto=webp&s=869c35c00bae406a644381caa41fc9f587ce2cbb

&#x200B;

They give a good  explaination to follow this up with:

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/ask\/answers\/07\/institutional\_holdings.asp](https://preview.redd.it/t6fkyizv5j471.png?width=398&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d3a792721f7063e9abb3d267fa0f677c809de10)

&#x200B;

The only real question at this point is if this is a data error or if there are legitimatley all these borrowed shares. If we put this in the context of the float it looks even worse because institutional ownership is revealed to really be 148.28m/112.70m = 131.57% of the float!

&#x200B;

Ever since the hedgies got caught with their pants down on GME with what turned out to be 140% of the shares shorted, this could be a telling sign that the same setup actually exists and is being cleverly hidden if you don't do the math on it.

&#x200B;

With all the popularity around CLOV there is absolutely no wonder at all why the stock had such a massive 80% plus spike the other day. The reason is Delta.

&#x200B;

As fellow degenerates purchase everything from FD's to long calls, they are requiring someone on the other end of that contract to purchase the delta in shares. Why? This is called  delta hedging. I'd hate to reduce it to this but its literally in the name of ""hedge fund"".

&#x200B;

Example. Stock xyz has a delta of 0.25 and you want to write a bunch of calls on it because well it cant go tits up. So you end up writing 10 call options. You total delta is 2.50. This translates to around 250 shares (0.25\*10\*100) needing to be bought to cover. This is an algo thing at this point in the stock game and so generally this hedge is just written into the systems.

So our hedgie buys 250 shares, writes their calls and everythings great. Then the nightmare happens that all call writers hate, the stock starts to upswing and swing up sharply. Your delta increases and NOW you HAVE to buy whatever the upswing in delta is. If delta moves to 0.75, to stay delta neutral you must purchase 500 shares (0.75-0.25\*10 call options =500 shares ).

&#x200B;

What we saw when this thing started to take off is delta screaming higher. I know that its around 0.55 right now for the short term options and up to around 0.61 for the leaps.

All in all considering that supposedly 71.43M shares are available, this seems slightly impossible for the stock to have rallied that hard and how is all the volume even possible if everything is not borrowed so heavily?

https://preview.redd.it/mhiffcbf9j471.png?width=1118&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8ac73194aa022959e1d847367209c845c958ddf

&#x200B;

745.60M shares traded hands. Even at the open at $16.60, this equates to $12,376,960,000 in dollars spend and that is being extremley extremely conservative.

So why is the stock down af these past 2 days? Well because someone fell asleep at the wheel and is now trying to avoid another GME and AMC fiasco. Trust me when I say someone on the other side of this stock is having sleepless nights. I'm entirely convinced that there are no shares available at all and data backs me up on this too.

You will notice that from this chart there are only 300,000 shares available. Remeber the delta at 0.55? Well this means 55 shares must be bought for every  contract so if anyone purchases 5,454.54 contracts then there would literally be no shares available.

On the 3rd of June there were only 15,000 shares available...

[https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/CLOV](https://preview.redd.it/wlte2cafaj471.png?width=1178&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ddf8737e771f29ee8d2523869ff9d172aa80581)

&#x200B;

If you dont pay attention to anything else in this post, this section is the crux of everything.

&#x200B;

There were only 15,000 shares availbe on June 3rd and on June 2nd the day before, the stock flew up from below 8 to over 9

https://preview.redd.it/ugymy575bj471.png?width=189&format=png&auto=webp&s=88f0de6930bbabfb2ee55b7671009806fc27f315

The very next day after this the stock came down from a gap up to 10 to about 9 and then BOOM breakout happens that very Monday and Tuesday (even wednesday at open really). They had to put out the fire and this is why the stock came down at all is the shorts trading all these shares between themselves. You'll notice however this is a very expensive endeavor as the fee is 117%. If they do not put this fire out now, this stock is going to cause billions and billions and billions of losses for hedgefunds and they do not want another bust to go down.

Just for a little sprinkle on top, BOA just downgraded the stock today with essentially reasoning that it looks too high 🤨 the ol bad news to drive the stock down is going to backfire.

TLDR

CLOV does not have any available shares, every options contract you buy forces hedge funds to purchase 55 more shares. There are at best 300,000 shares available just off the June 3rd low of only 15,000 shares being available and if 5,454.54 contracts (which anyone can do that math that even a small whale could make this occur) are bought there would no more shares from this standpoint either.

Feeling down about the direction of the stock lately? Rubbish and here is why. Take note that I have no idea what I'm doing and draw crayon charts in my spare time. Not financial advice!

&#x200B;

Looking at the current state of shares available this puppy is ready to pop off and its just a matter of time regardless if your involved or not.

&#x200B;

There are many times that people predict a massive  short squeeze and people just promote random things like naked short selling but this is not what is going on here.

&#x200B;

Let us begin with the short interest.

&#x200B;

Shares outstanding: 148.28M

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tc4kmuor2j471.png?width=417&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a204002ce04dd1642212eec53dda172e7e4e48a

24% held by insiders:

&#x200B;

[148.28\*0.24 = 35.58M ](https://preview.redd.it/2cpb1uew2j471.png?width=412&format=png&auto=webp&s=94be5b644b244611024f78b04c1c4092ac91f516)

&#x200B;

Shares short May 28th: 41.27M

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i8rkb6wg3j471.png?width=416&format=png&auto=webp&s=47667ee19ed85fa4f22ad25f0394cfd60ebc5318

shares outstanding - insider shares = 112.70M

&#x200B;

Normally we would look at this and say welp 112.70M - 41.27M = 71.43M shares floating around and this would be very difficult to force a squeeze on as GME had maybe 50,000 shares available during its last squeeze with the proper adjustments in place.

&#x200B;

However things get very interesting :)

When you look at how many shares are held by institutions the number is 106.25%

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yjw2ov134j471.png?width=293&format=png&auto=webp&s=47cb4e09df5cd1dc0b9fb20688ba4efd5ce50486

This is obviously highly irregular. Say you look up a regular stock like AAPL, you will find % owned by institutions is 58.69%, AMZN is similar at 59.32%.

&#x200B;

With this said, this implies that 148.28m\*1.0625 = 157.54m shares are owned by institutions 🤪

&#x200B;

We already discovered that there are only 71.43M shares available. This can only mean that there are 86.11M shares that are literally duplicates in some way.

&#x200B;

Investopedia explains that this could be due to a delay in updates:

BUT investopedia also explains that another reason can  be short selling between investors:

&#x200B;

The only real question at this point is if this is a data error or if there are legitimatley all these borrowed shares. If we put this in the context of the float it looks even worse because institutional ownership is revealed to really be 148.28m/112.70m = 131.57% of the float!

&#x200B;

Ever since the hedgies got caught with their pants down on GME with what turned out to be 140% of the shares shorted, this could be a telling sign that the same setup actually exists and is being cleverly hidden if you don't do the math on it.

&#x200B;

With all the popularity around CLOV there is absolutely no wonder at all why the stock had such a massive 80% plus spike the other day. The reason is Delta.

&#x200B;

As fellow degenerates purchase everything from FD's to long calls, they are requiring someone on the other end of that contract to purchase the delta in shares. Why? This is called  delta hedging. I'd hate to reduce it to this but its literally in the name of ""hedge fund"".

&#x200B;

Example. Stock xyz has a delta of 0.25 and you want to write a bunch of calls on it because well it cant go tits up. So you end up writing 10 call options. You total delta is 2.50. This translates to around 250 shares (0.25\*10\*100) needing to be bought to cover. This is an algo thing at this point in the stock game and so generally this hedge is just written into the systems.

So our hedgie buys 250 shares, writes their calls and everythings great. Then the nightmare happens that all call writers hate, the stock starts to upswing and swing up sharply. Your delta increases and NOW you HAVE to buy whatever the upswing in delta is. If delta moves to 0.75, to stay delta neutral you must purchase 500 shares (0.75-0.25\*10 call options =500 shares ).

&#x200B;

What we saw when this thing started to take off is delta screaming higher. I know that its around 0.55 right now for the short term options and up to around 0.61 for the leaps.

All in all considering that supposedly 71.43M shares are available, this seems slightly impossible for the stock to have rallied that hard and how is all the volume even possible if everything is not borrowed so heavily?

&#x200B;

745.60M shares traded hands. Even at the open at $16.60, this equates to $12,376,960,000 in dollars spend and that is being extremley extremely conservative.

So why is the stock down af these past 2 days? Well because someone fell asleep at the wheel and is now trying to avoid another GME and AMC fiasco. Trust me when I say someone on the other side of this stock is having sleepless nights. I'm entirely convinced that there are no shares available at all and data backs me up on this too.

You will notice that from this chart there are only 300,000 shares available. Remeber the delta at 0.55? Well this means 55 shares must be bought for every  contract so if anyone purchases 5,454.54 contracts then there would literally be no shares available.

On the 3rd of June there were only 15,000 shares available...

&#x200B;

If you dont pay attention to anything else in this post, this section is the crux of everything.

&#x200B;

There were only 15,000 shares availbe on June 3rd and on June 2nd the day before, the stock flew up from below 8 to over 9

https://preview.redd.it/ugymy575bj471.png?width=189&format=png&auto=webp&s=88f0de6930bbabfb2ee55b7671009806fc27f315

The very next day after this the stock came down from a gap up to 10 to about 9 and then BOOM breakout happens that very Monday and Tuesday (even wednesday at open really). They had to put out the fire and this is why the stock came down at all is the shorts trading all these shares between themselves. You'll notice however this is a very expensive endeavor as the fee is 117%. If they do not put this fire out now, this stock is going to cause billions and billions and billions of losses for hedgefunds and they do not want another bust to go down.

Just for a little sprinkle on top, BOA just downgraded the stock today with essentially reasoning that it looks too high 🤨 the ol bad news to drive the stock down is going to backfire.

TLDR

CLOV does not have any available shares, every options contract you buy forces hedge funds to purchase 55 more shares. There are at best 300,000 shares available just off the June 3rd low of only 15,000 shares being available and if 5,454.54 contracts (which anyone can do that math that even a small whale could make this occur) are bought there would no more shares from this standpoint either. There is bad news about CLOV all of a sudden and this is no accident at all!

There were only 15,000 shares availbe on June 3rd and on June 2nd the day before, the stock flew up from below 8 to over 9

https://preview.redd.it/ugymy575bj471.png?width=189&format=png&auto=webp&s=88f0de6930bbabfb2ee55b7671009806fc27f315

The very next day after this the stock came down from a gap up to 10 to about 9 and then BOOM breakout happens that very Monday and Tuesday (even wednesday at open really). They had to put out the fire and this is why the stock came down at all is the shorts trading all these shares between themselves. You'll notice however this is a very expensive endeavor as the fee is 117%. If they do not put this fire out now, this stock is going to cause billions and billions and billions of losses for hedgefunds and they do not want another bust to go down.

Just for a little sprinkle on top, BOA just downgraded the stock today with essentially reasoning that it looks too high 🤨 the ol bad news to drive the stock down is going to backfire.

TLDR

CLOV does not have any available shares, every options contract you buy forces hedge funds to purchase 55 more shares. There are at best 300,000 shares available just off the June 3rd low of only 15,000 shares being available and if 5,454.54 contracts (which anyone can do that math that even a small whale could make this occur) are bought there would no more shares from this standpoint either. There is bad news about CLOV all of a sudden and this is no accident at all!

Feeling down about the direction of the stock lately? Rubbish and here is why. Take note that I have no idea what I'm doing and draw crayon charts in my spare time. Not financial advice!

&#x200B;

Looking at the current state of shares available this puppy is ready to pop off and its just a matter of time regardless if your involved or not.

&#x200B;

There are many times that people predict a massive  short squeeze and people just promote random things like naked short selling but this is not what is going on here.

&#x200B;

Let us begin with the short interest.

&#x200B;

Shares outstanding: 148.28M

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tc4kmuor2j471.png?width=417&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a204002ce04dd1642212eec53dda172e7e4e48a

24% held by insiders:

&#x200B;

[148.28\*0.24 = 35.58M ](https://preview.redd.it/2cpb1uew2j471.png?width=412&format=png&auto=webp&s=94be5b644b244611024f78b04c1c4092ac91f516)

&#x200B;

Shares short May 28th: 41.27M

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i8rkb6wg3j471.png?width=416&format=png&auto=webp&s=47667ee19ed85fa4f22ad25f0394cfd60ebc5318

shares outstanding - insider shares = 112.70M

&#x200B;

Normally we would look at this and say welp 112.70M - 41.27M = 71.43M shares floating around and this would be very difficult to force a squeeze on as GME had maybe 50,000 shares available during its last squeeze with the proper adjustments in place.

&#x200B;

However things get very interesting :)

When you look at how many shares are held by institutions the number is 106.25%

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yjw2ov134j471.png?width=293&format=png&auto=webp&s=47cb4e09df5cd1dc0b9fb20688ba4efd5ce50486

This is obviously highly irregular. Say you look up a regular stock like AAPL, you will find % owned by institutions is 58.69%, AMZN is similar at 59.32%.

&#x200B;

With this said, this implies that 148.28m\*1.0625 = 157.54m shares are owned by institutions 🤪

&#x200B;

We already discovered that there are only 71.43M shares available. This can only mean that there are 86.11M shares that are literally duplicates in some way.

&#x200B;

Investopedia explains that this could be due to a delay in updates:

BUT investopedia also explains that another reason can  be short selling between investors:

&#x200B;

They give a good  explaination to follow this up with:

&#x200B;

The only real question at this point is if this is a data error or if there are legitimatley all these borrowed shares. If we put this in the context of the float it looks even worse because institutional ownership is revealed to really be 148.28m/112.70m = 131.57% of the float!

&#x200B;

Ever since the hedgies got caught with their pants down on GME with what turned out to be 140% of the shares shorted, this could be a telling sign that the same setup actually exists and is being cleverly hidden if you don't do the math on it.

&#x200B;

With all the popularity around CLOV there is absolutely no wonder at all why the stock had such a massive 80% plus spike the other day. The reason is Delta.

&#x200B;

As fellow degenerates purchase everything from FD's to long calls, they are requiring someone on the other end of that contract to purchase the delta in shares. Why? This is called  delta hedging. I'd hate to reduce it to this but its literally in the name of ""hedge fund"".

&#x200B;

Example. Stock xyz has a delta of 0.25 and you want to write a bunch of calls on it because well it cant go tits up. So you end up writing 10 call options. You total delta is 2.50. This translates to around 250 shares (0.25\*10\*100) needing to be bought to cover. This is an algo thing at this point in the stock game and so generally this hedge is just written into the systems.

So our hedgie buys 250 shares, writes their calls and everythings great. Then the nightmare happens that all call writers hate, the stock starts to upswing and swing up sharply. Your delta increases and NOW you HAVE to buy whatever the upswing in delta is. If delta moves to 0.75, to stay delta neutral you must purchase 500 shares (0.75-0.25\*10 call options =500 shares ).

&#x200B;

What we saw when this thing started to take off is delta screaming higher. I know that its around 0.55 right now for the short term options and up to around 0.61 for the leaps.

All in all considering that supposedly 71.43M shares are available, this seems slightly impossible for the stock to have rallied that hard and how is all the volume even possible if everything is not borrowed so heavily?

https://preview.redd.it/mhiffcbf9j471.png?width=1118&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8ac73194aa022959e1d847367209c845c958ddf

&#x200B;

745.60M shares traded hands. Even at the open at $16.60, this equates to $12,376,960,000 in dollars spend and that is being extremley extremely conservative.

So why is the stock down af these past 2 days? Well because someone fell asleep at the wheel and is now trying to avoid another GME and AMC fiasco. Trust me when I say someone on the other side of this stock is having sleepless nights. I'm entirely convinced that there are no shares available at all and data backs me up on this too.

As fellow degenerates purchase everything from FD's to long calls, they are requiring someone on the other end of that contract to purchase the delta in shares. Why? This is called  delta hedging. I'd hate to reduce it to this but its literally in the name of ""hedge fund"".

&#x200B;

Example. Stock xyz has a delta of 0.25 and you want to write a bunch of calls on it because well it cant go tits up. So you end up writing 10 call options. You total delta is 2.50. This translates to around 250 shares (0.25\*10\*100) needing to be bought to cover. This is an algo thing at this point in the stock game and so generally this hedge is just written into the systems.

So our hedgie buys 250 shares, writes their calls and everythings great. Then the nightmare happens that all call writers hate, the stock starts to upswing and swing up sharply. Your delta increases and NOW you HAVE to buy whatever the upswing in delta is. If delta moves to 0.75, to stay delta neutral you must purchase 500 shares (0.75-0.25\*10 call options =500 shares ).

&#x200B;

What we saw when this thing started to take off is delta screaming higher. I know that its around 0.55 right now for the short term options and up to around 0.61 for the leaps.

All in all considering that supposedly 71.43M shares are available, this seems slightly impossible for the stock to have rallied that hard and how is all the volume even possible if everything is not borrowed so heavily?

&#x200B;

745.60M shares traded hands. Even at the open at $16.60, this equates to $12,376,960,000 in dollars spend and that is being extremley extremely conservative.

So why is the stock down af these past 2 days? Well because someone fell asleep at the wheel and is now trying to avoid another GME and AMC fiasco. Trust me when I say someone on the other side of this stock is having sleepless nights. I'm entirely convinced that there are no shares available at all and data backs me up on this too.

You will notice that from this chart there are only 300,000 shares available. Remeber the delta at 0.55? Well this means 55 shares must be bought for every  contract so if anyone purchases 5,454.54 contracts then there would literally be no shares available.

On the 3rd of June there were only 15,000 shares available...

[https:\/\/iborrowdesk.com\/report\/CLOV](https://preview.redd.it/wlte2cafaj471.png?width=1178&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ddf8737e771f29ee8d2523869ff9d172aa80581)

&#x200B;

If you dont pay attention to anything else in this post, this section is the crux of everything.

&#x200B;

There were only 15,000 shares availbe on June 3rd and on June 2nd the day before, the stock flew up from below 8 to over 9

https://preview.redd.it/ugymy575bj471.png?width=189&format=png&auto=webp&s=88f0de6930bbabfb2ee55b7671009806fc27f315

The very next day after this the stock came down from a gap up to 10 to about 9 and then BOOM breakout happens that very Monday and Tuesday (even wednesday at open really). They had to put out the fire and this is why the stock came down at all is the shorts trading all these shares between themselves. You'll notice however this is a very expensive endeavor as the fee is 117%. If they do not put this fire out now, this stock is going to cause billions and billions and billions of losses for hedgefunds and they do not want another bust to go down.

Just for a little sprinkle on top, BOA just downgraded the stock today with essentially reasoning that it looks too high 🤨 the ol bad news to drive the stock down is going to backfire.

TLDR

CLOV does not have any available shares, every options contract you buy forces hedge funds to purchase 55 more shares. There are at best 300,000 shares available just off the June 3rd low of only 15,000 shares being available and if 5,454.54 contracts (which anyone can do that math that even a small whale could make this occur) are bought there would no more shares from this standpoint either. There is bad news about CLOV all of a sudden and this is no accident at all!

I think serious EV supporters quietly acknowledge deep in their souls that battery powered long haul trucks are not seriously happening for the next few years if they do.

Plus, it’s cheaper to convert existing equipment to consume RNG as opposed to new vehicles with battery technology that will eventually need replacing when the batteries cannot hold their charge like they used to.

318,RNG," The EV revolution is a consumer play.

RNG is being used by Amazon for their fleet vehicles, UPS, long distance freight trucks.

Take freight trucks, for example.  They are not going to go electric (in current technology) because the weight and space for the batteries significantly reduces their hauling capability.  The time to charge the batteries will eat into their bottom line.  The cost of converting their fleet will be astronomical.

Existing fleet vehicles can be converted on the cheap.  Refueling time is the same as fueling diesel. RNG doesn't change the weight or space on the vehicles much.  I read somewhere that the cost of RNG would be the same as diesel (part of the deal with Total and CLNE).

If you were a trucker that had to buy your own hauler..  would you want to junk it and pay even more for an electric one that reduced your hauling capacity and earning potential per run (in time and amount of goods transferred)?

If you owned a fleet of trucks, would you rather pay $100s to convert your diesel to RNG, or dump them and replace them with expensive electrics in the 100ks?

And the cherry on top is that using CLNE's RNG, they are taking the methane from existing sources (trash dumps, processing plants, farms) and turning that into fuel that burns cleaner.

324,CI," Well the short answer is the federal RFS and the state programs that CLNE utilizes are carbon reduction programs that really don't care (directly) about NOx and SOx emissions.  In fact, many of the gas upgrade technologies still discharge NOx and SOx to the atmosphere, along with a significant amount of Carbon Dioxide.  The most (profitable) RNG sources are intercepting methane emissions that would have previously been discharged to the atmosphere (that's where the ""cow farts"" comes into play, it's actually the methane from their manure as it breaks down), cleaning them up, and then using them to offset fossil-derived natural gas.  So you get multiple things coming into the mix at once, first you have the reduced emissions of burning natural gas vs. diesel.  Then you layer on top of that the offset from the impact of renewable vs. fossil-derived fuel, on top of the utilization of something that was previously emitted to the atmosphere. If you get really industrious, you can capture the Carbon Dioxide and find a way to sequester it and further enhance the impact. This all gives you an actual net emission rate that is below zero and is one of the few renewable techs that can boast such a thing.  Where it gets real interesting is California's LCFS program (and a few others patterned after it) basically scale the revenue based on that ""Carbon Intensity"" and once you go negative CI, the formula turns into a money machine.",dustymash,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxfrlp/everything_you_need_to_know_about_clne_besides/h1fp33t/,0.026,0.904,0.07,0.7902

415,UWMC," I tried to find a paper on the topic, but can't seem to find anything explicit on the relationship between float size & abnormal returns due to index inclusion. The reason for that could be that the effect is either insignificant or a well guarded secret by the event desks that trade this kind of stuff. Hard to say, but when I think about Tesla's S&P inclusion and the crazy run it had after the announcement, I'm going to guess that float probably isn't as important as the unadulterated, meme-fueled power of price indiscriminate, highly leveraged buyers. More importantly, I think timing of it all is particularly fortuitous since there are many eyes on UWMC at the moment, which isn't too dissimilar to the set-up that took Tesla to the moon on the back of multiple catalysts last year. Even better - we have insider buying, which is a much more important signal than insider selling, on top of a large share buyback relative to market cap. I've noticed that most companies undertaking large share buybacks relative to market cap, like Logitech for example, has been outperforming their peers even though Logitech has guided -5% -> +5% revenue for FY '21 (which honestly isn't bad at all given the banner year 2020 was for them).

534,BB," Agreed. I think most of the reason there isn't more interest in Blackberry is most people in their mid-20's and older still think of Blackberry as an old phone company with outdated brick phones and BBM messenger. 

I won't lie, that is the first thing that comes to mind still if you said ""think of the first thing that comes to mind when you hear Blackberry.""

However, they are doing so much more now and completely different. I'm not sure the stock price really goes down from the 13-16 range it's been trading at the last week here. 

Outside chance it could get pumped up a bit, but most likely not with people not seeing the big spike to $50 they expected and moved on to Clover and are now probably bag holding that one after their one big day or day and a half. 

However, if more people actually look into BB and believe in them, there could slowly be a lot of BB action and the stock price slowly rises up to those lofty expectations.

2) Watch as stock goes up +40%.

3) Buy in at ATH expecting +100% tomorrow.

4) Watch as stock drops 30% from ATH the next day.

5) Go on Google and search for articles that confirm the company is a) undervalued b) a hidden gem c) a great recovery play d) a long term play

6) Go back on WSB and bring the good news to all like-minded individuals

7) Quietly sell off your position at -45%.

1371,BB," Here's a trick to getting BB shares cheaper than on the open market:

&#x200B;

Sell puts ATM or ITM, collect the premium, wait for assignment - likely to occur when your time is almost expired and BB's price has gone lower than strike price (deeper ITM, the better).  You now have shares - premium received.  i.e. the $ you get is your discount.

&#x200B;

Example:

&#x200B;

BB is about $14 right now.

&#x200B;

Sell 1 put at 14 strike with little time.  Pretend you get $25 dollars per contract.

&#x200B;

If BB continues down, wait for assignment.  If BB goes flat or up, you'll only get the premium not shares.  In that case, simply rinse & repeat until you get shares.

&#x200B;

If assigned,

cost basis is (14 strike \* 100 shares \* 1 contract) - (25 dollars \* 1 contract) = $1375 ; $1400 on the open market

your per share cost is reduced from 14 to 1375/100 = $13.75

&#x200B;

Higher the premium, greater the discount.

Boeing Black is a good example of a device that would definitely be chosen over blackberry for secure comms, at any rate. 

&#x200B;

BB devices these days are bog standard consumer android phones at this point.

Blackberry's phone business is anemic at best, unimpressive at worst, and difficult to procure on the consumer side without going through third parties (you can't even buy from BB anymore)

1410,TX," Two additional points: 

- Ternium runs quarterly contracts for most of their big clients as opposed to the North American standard annual contracts - this has allowed them to realize the increased profits of the steel shortage faster than any other company in the Americas.

- Additionally, daily Volume on TX is roughly 1/8th that of the other mid-to-large cap American and European steel producers, and **76% of the market cap is owned by parent/sister companies Techint and Tenaris - both of which are owned by the Italian industrial tycoon familia, the Rocca’s.**

1445,HRC," It is true that I'm less familiar with $MT's contract steel pricing structure overall. I do know USA companies have annual steel contracts. To be fair, some of those do have quarterly pricing adjustments - but those only adjust to a certain percentage of the prevailing HRC price of the previous quarter.

I suppose my comment should have specified ""North and Latin American based steel producers"". And while $MT does indeed have some production in the Americas, it represents the smallest continent of their revenue since selling their USA assets to $CLF. If you want to compare ability to take advantage of steel pricing for the North American market:

* $TX's Mexican business unit Q1 price per ton: [$1,066](https://s2.q4cdn.com/156255844/files/doc_financials/quarterly/2021/1Q2021/PRTernium1Q2021.pdf).
* $MT's NAFTA Q1 price per ton: [$850](https://corporate-media.arcelormittal.com/media/wmyepowf/1q-21-earnings-release.pdf).

Thus there is a gap holding $MT's ability to realize constantly rising higher steel prices in the NAFTA region compared to $TX. If we further want to look at Q4 2020 as another datapoint on this:

* $TX's Mexican business unit Q4 2020 price per ton: [$841](https://s2.q4cdn.com/156255844/files/doc_financials/quarterly/2020/4Q2020/4Q2020PRTernium.pdf).

1558,AMC," Alright guys I don't post much but I believe I should share some of my knowledge. I truly believe WKHS is one of the best stocks to be in at the moment and here is why:   


1) Currently it is the most shorted stock holding 51.37% SI of FF as reported by Ortex.   
2) It also has a lot of hype built around it with over 937 mentions on WSB discussion data as reported by Quiverqant.   
3) On top of that, the market cap is very low compared to other companies such as AMC, do not get me wrong I am not trying to downplay other companies but I am just trying to compare it to the legendary meme stock. AMC's market cap is currently 21.48B and WKHS is at only 1.86B. When AMC was at 11.45 it only had a market cap of 5.37B. 

Also AMC had less short interest more than half of what WKHS has when it popped off from this level. Say WKHS gets similar love that AMC had, it could legit shoot like crazy. If WKHS is at a 20B market cap, which is very likely due to more than double the amount of short interest, this will put WKHS shares at a valuation of around $164 per share. Even if it only gets a market cap of 5B, this will put WKHS shares at a valuation of $41 per share.  


Overall, I see crazy potential with this stock and I truly believe that this is one of the hottest stocks in the market as of right now!

But the issue of selling knockoff items isn't exclusive to Wish. AliExpress has the same problem, as does Amazon to a lesser extent. Amazon continues to get away with selling  counterfeit items (just look at the ""1TB"" SD cards they sell for 10 bucks). Most people probably have no clue they've purchased a knockoff and, if they do realize it, Amazon just gives them a refund.

Robinhood has massive conflict of interest with their ties to Citadel which played a massive part in the whole GME/AMC issue. This was not unforeseen. This was a choice.

Better promos constantly, a comment section that is like a reddit thread ( sometimes for better or worse) or similar to a Facebook comment section under each stock. Ratings by users as well plus competitions and better responsiveness than Robinhood. Also they don't go down near as often on software issues as robinhood does. Also the whole citidel/ Melvin issues really helped soldify so many ppl to jump ship. Robinhood only redemption is early adoption as a ""fee"" trading platform and very simple UI with out any unessary mess and extras that many platforms offer that many people don't understand and usually don't care to learn like the indpeth charts that blows away any of that Robinhood pro version has",mudtires03,13,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxjolz/i_made_a_wish_and_then_dropped_485k_into_it_at/h1fxa9q/,0.034,0.84,0.125,0.9131

1619,DD," Call me crazy, but with the pandemic passing and lockdown thawing, computer accessory sales will decrease at least a bit. While they are eof course a growth stock, last year was very much an outlier opportunity for the whole world wfh+nothing to do but build a PC and play video games. That will slow down a bit. 

Also you quote their profit while saying their market cap is ""insane"". 20PE isn't wildly undervalued imo. Why do you ignore PE and go straight to PS? Odd. Logitech, the absolute whale of the space is at PE 23. Does corsair seem so wildly undervalued now? Where it looks wild is PS I agree and it's why I like the stock. 

My major concern is that Logitech will capitalize on return to work (all FAANG appear to be bringing whole staff list back to office), whereas corsair hype wanes as no one wants to build a PC in 2021-2022 as they are spending time traveling, going outside, blah blah. Spending profile of the consumer shifts hard away from corsair products in the return to normal. Don't get me wrong, I think they'll grow, but face ripping? Meh. 

Wsb - king of the unbalanced DD. You can like the stock and still think of a few WCGWs (what could go wrongs) to show you have more than half a brain.

Edit: good counterpoints boys, don't get me wrong I like the stock and I'm actually in Nov 40c myself. But think bigger than just your tunnel visioned bull mindset. Think...what could actually go wrong? And the big one is...everyone's dollars could pretty much only be saved, or blown on media for 1.5 yrs.

1652,CRSR," They also stated in their last conference call that their revenue would have been measurably higher if they didn't run out of stock due to their own supply chains. Put differently, 71% growth is what they achieved while being supply limited. 

I also have a theory that high-end peripherals lag new builds more than a company like Logi. In my experience, when people build new computers they put all their money into CPU and GPU. Then after a few months of personal cashflow they then upgrade the peripherals as they are the easiest PC upgrades. 

Ive probably bought 7 corsair keyboards in my life because they're the perfect gift to PC gamers. I can't buy my cousin a new CPU without knowledge of their computer, I can buy them a new keyboard though.

1655,CRSR," I think this is a great counter-point (coming from a bullish CRSR holder) and I think their growth might be a tad slower that'll make this more of a long-term play if you want large gains.

Moreover, the free float is considerably smaller than 88.4 million since insiders hold approximately 60 million of those shares (EagleTree holding 57 million and then NEOs holding a few million off the top of my head.) Furthermore, it was profit taking by ET after they sold 5 million shares last week that caused the price to tank, not short selling as the linked DD indicates. This was the first big sell EagleTree executed after the lockup expired on March 21st (although they had sold around 15 million shares prior to that after IPO) and this is one of the big arguments against short-term price increases since EagleTree selling will certainly tank the price. As far as I'm concerned, that just means more shares in the free float to decrease volatility, but the short-term concerns are valid.

I'm still accumulating and bullish, but just stuff to consider. EagleTree's intentions are unknown but the may want to hold a 50% stake in Corsair which means they can't sell too many more. On the other hand, their cost basis is between $6-8 dollars from 4 years ago, so more profit taking is totally with in the realm of possibility for them.",tevans559,18,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxhh7d/crsr_dd_or_why_you_should_park_all_your_cash_in/h1evalv/,0.008,0.85,0.142,0.9736

1779,GME," So If MC and LSC lost ~6 BILLION in the month of May that could mean that they almost have the entire float shorted. 
 
May GME:
START = $162.19
END = $249.03
DELTA = $86,84

Then we devide that 6B by $86,84 and we get...

69.092.584

1780,MC," So If MC and LSC lost ~6 BILLION in the month of May that could mean that they almost have the entire float shorted. 
 
May GME:
START = $162.19
END = $249.03
DELTA = $86,84

Then we devide that 6B by $86,84 and we get...

69.092.584

So IF all of their short positions are GME they need the whole float to have lost 6B.

Just warning you, if you go for a really long term play don't expect much gains as your money stagnated.

The USPS is the worst of corporations and government control. The USPS will NOT pay that contract out at once and they CAN cancel the contract at any time, there will be many out clauses built in and you won't have a clue because it never has to be reported

 Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) Stock Sinks As Market Gains: What You Should Know
 Mentioned: CLF
 In the latest trading session, Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) closed at $22.96, marking a -1.12% move from the previous day. This change lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.47%.

 Heading into today, shares of the mining company had gained 16.27% over the past month, outpacing the Basic Materials sector's loss of 2.29% and the S&P 500's loss of 0.12% in that time.

 CLF will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, CLF is projected to report earnings of $1.18 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 480.65%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for  revenue is projecting net sales of $4.75 billion, up 334.97% from the year-ago period.

 For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.45 per share and revenue of $18.09 billion, which would represent changes of +2517.65% and +237.83%, respectively, from the prior year.

 It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for CLF. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.

 Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.

 The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over  the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 12.66% higher. CLF is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).

 Digging into valuation, CLF currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 5.22. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 11.34, which means CLF is trading at a discount to the group.

 Also, we should mention that CLF has a PEG ratio of 0.19. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Mining-Miscellaneous industry currently had  an average PEG ratio of 2.13 as of yesterday's close.

 The Mining-Miscellaneous industry is part of the Basic Materials sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 175, putting it in the bottom 32% of all 250+ industries.

 The Zacks Industry Rank includes is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to  1.

1989,AMC," The Reddit Apes are interesting. If they can actually become a thing, and the group continues to grow as the concept continues to work, true investors will surely follow. Apes supposedly pick a stock like AMC. They then hold the stock no matter what as they attract more true Apes to the cause. Shorts drive the stock down. True Apes don’t care. More Apes pile on. A supposedly worthless stock like AMC or GME continues to hold some SP as it rockets up and down. More Apes add to their numbers, etc, etc to the point the shorts give up. A beaten down good stock is given a break and once again turns into something, and the Apes end up owning the world. At least, that is what I gather to be the Ape Reddit plan. Do I have it wrong?

1994,CLF," I have been investing in CLF since it was trading at $6/share and currently have a average cost of $12.93. 

This has always been a relatively volatile stock, and was trading just below current levels a few weeks back. The stock has a lot going for it, but also currently carries a fair amount of debt that a lot of analysts do not like. So on good news, it shoots up. On slightly bad news, or frankly no news at all, the shorts will knock it back down a bit. It was a pretty nice opportunity to pick up calls cheap, wait for it to bump back up to its peak, and then sell them for 50% gains. 

What it is going to do now that you retards got involved in it is anyone's guess though. Frankly, I am a little pissed you all screwed up the dynamic.

Before all this, I personally felt the stock was worth $30-$40 so long as it can continue to pay down its debt, which they are prioritizing. So I am still holding. There is actual value here.",Ice_IX,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxcz0o/clf_german_ape_sticks_his_banana_into_hot/h1eix14/,0.13,0.725,0.145,0.5158
1995,CLF," I think it really matters on the play.  There is a lot of plays that people just want to ""short squeeze"".  I personally don't align with this strategy.

With or without a short % numbers on CLF, I like it because I believe in the CEO and I believe in the company financials going forward.   I truly believe this can be a $100 plus stock in the next year.

Additionally, I like contributing to American companies that work to get us off of foreign materials and more domestic.  

if the stock price keeps increasing, and the short sellers see, maybe this this stock is not very profitable for me to short sell, and if they move onto their next stock, that could also potentially help the price.  

Not Financial Advice.  I just really like this stock and American STEEL, and passionate CEO's.",itzatol,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxcz0o/clf_german_ape_sticks_his_banana_into_hot/h1etf76/,0.018,0.819,0.162,0.9514

First, the war with Rocket is due to Rocket poaching real estate agents, turning them into hybrid originators, and cutting out traditional LOs.. 
Second, UWM is taking a ton of wholesale volume from RKT. You won't see this on the reports until 2021 is done. 
Third, for most of 2021, margins have been getting thinner and thinner as bonds have been rising, but lenders are trying to keep volume up by keeping rates low. The bond drop over the last week probably helps, but the margins will still be thinner than what had been reported in 2020 and the first half of 2021. For the most part, originations will slow since most of the refinances are already complete. I'm not bearish on RKT, however I don't see a ton of upside here. Be careful.

2198,RKT," I have/had spent months  researching the intricacies of the mortgage market and interest rates, so I've noticed some inconsistencies. Please take this in the positive manner it's meant to be taken in, and don't be like this guy: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwymz6/whats\_going\_on\_with\_rkt\_its\_time\_to\_enter\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwymz6/whats_going_on_with_rkt_its_time_to_enter_a/)

I guess I will begin:

1. Wholesale has better rates than retail. There's something to be said for why. In truth it's a combination of 1) wholesale lenders having a slimmed down model and less fixed cost, and 2) the ability of mortgage brokers to shop around rather than having a captive customer. Usually, retail companies like Rocket who know they have the customer trapped, know they can charge higher rates... So they do. After all, why not?
2. When there are higher interest rates, people become more and more price sensitive, and so they go to wholesale mortgage lenders. The market also becomes much more purchase heavy, which favors wholesale mortgage brokers.
3. Wholesale generally, and especially UWMC has a speed advantage in time to close. UWMC's is 14 days to close. The industry average is 52 days, and RKT's is 30 to 45 days. UWMC's investment in its technology, due to being a pure play mortgage originator with a forward looking ceo, has allowed it to reduce its cost to originate to be the lowest of any company, and it's not even close. He can price out other mortgage companies while still being profitable, and you can look at HMPT's earnings call if you think i exaggerate. They are saying that they will be break even this upcoming quarter.
4. The cost to originate for UWMC is estimated to be 50 BPS across fixed and variable cost, and UWMC is using that to leverage a price war (It's a naturally occurring cycle of highs to lows, as people want to keep volume, before gain on sale margins even out to 110-180BPS which is the normal times gain on sale margin). Their currently price matching any lender up to 35 basis points from June 8 to June 20. You can also see the impact this is having on RKT as they are estimating a 100 BPS margin for the growth channel in their mortgage originations which is TPO and not retail.
5. You say RKT won, but they didn't. They just didn't win the broker war, and it's simple to see why. But i'll break it down. They gained 7% market share sequentially, Q-o-Q. That's not what I want to see after the last 3 years of growth and Q-o-Q growth. Add to that, that the ultimatum took effect on March 15th and the reporting period ends March 30th, and the period it took effect is only 15 days out of 3 months. Tack on the fact that UWMC let people close out their loans AFTER the ultimatum if they had any in the pipeline, and Q2 was not any measure of anything. You also forget that ROCKET TPO is not JUST brokers, but rockets correspondent channel (Think builders, credit unions, and community banks), and just yeah. No contest, look to Q3 guidance which you're glossing over.
6. They guided down, and significantly so this upcoming quarter. I wonder why? To the tune of roughly 17-20% if I recall correctly, and that's why they tanked so hard. Because markets are forward looking. UWMC is guiding UP, with a BPS of 75-110.
7. The reason UWMC missed by 2B is because interest rates mooned in the period (And if you look at RKT's earnings call or UWMC's they say they hadn't expected that), and UWMC's time to close is 2x-3x faster than anyone else, so they finished up their loans but demand had softened a decent amount. On the other hand, other mortgage originators could coast because they were still doing loans from 1-2 months back. They won't have that ability now. You can look at WSJ's interest rate tables if you don't believe me about the interest rates.
8. UWMC is constantly innovating and trying to do better, including recently bettering their partner points, increasing the types of loans they give (Like manufactured homes, ARMs, More Jumbo). They also had turned off JUMBO and FHA loans in March 2020 out of a need to be conservative, whereas others didn't. They have had those back on partway through the first quarter now. I guess my point is that the CEO has stated they will be the number one mortgage originator by 2024 in a  recent article posted. This is 1 year forward than he initially estimated (2025).
9. RKT is mostly refinance focused. I'm sorry, it just is. UWMC is more purchase focused. With refinance volume from years in the future pulled forward, that's important to note. It's a cyclical business. There's a counter point here, and it hedges against higher interest rates, and generates consistent income, but I'm not going to say it and let you tell me what that is. It doesn't make up for the loss of GOS volume but it cushions it.

That's from the bread and butter mortgage business.

Rocket Auto: Car companies who finance usually give the best rates, especially to the much wanted high credit borrowers that RKT will covet. Furthermore RKT doesn't want to go the very high interest rate loans that very low credit people can only get. This somewhat limits their volume here, and therefore their profit, from the negligible volume it does compared to its bread and butter. Don't get me wrong, it'll expand and it will be strong growth, but everything is relative.

2216,RKT," Just bringing more perspectives from mortgage industry, on why I think its growth is not sustainable.

1. 90% of RKT’s loan volume comes from refi in 2020, driven by DECREASING rate. Either FED raises rate or not, refi volume is going to burn out. Check historic MBA refi index and compare with rate if you will. Your point of continued low rate environment can only be good to purchase mortgage volume, which is nothing to RKT. Likewise for the whole market. Even RKT is taking more market share, it’s a shrinking market.
2. The high 2020 gain-on-sale margin is enjoyed by all lenders, not only RKT. Reason? Refi demand melted up and all lenders suffered from capacity constraint, so they charge higher for a mortgage. Once refi volume dies (and it’s already happening), the margin is going back to its pre-covid low (if not 2018 low).",OwnWing381,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nx7vfo/why_rkt_is_my_1_investment_and_it_should_be_yours/h1eqtzm/,0.057,0.87,0.073,0.5233

2233,RKT," First, I can tell you are a UWMC fanboy just by what you've written without you stating you are such.  You're going to need more months to learn how to really study companies it appears.  Almost everything you have written is speculation, not facts.  I base all information on numbers, not what the CEO tells me or hypotheticals I conjure in a euphoric state.  

&#x200B;

1.  In general, wholesale does tend to have better rates historically, that is across all companies.  But margins are better on direct to consumer.
2. This isn't true in the least.  There is more room to negotiate rates on the direct to consumer side than there is wholesale.
3. 100% correct about time for wholesale.  RKT's time is actually 21 days last quarter whereas UWMCs is 17 days.  RKT sets expectations at 30-45 days because every state is different and direct to consumer loans often can be slowed down by the consumer not submitting information quickly when requested.  Either way, on the wholesale side, there is roughly 4 days different.  This is the only metric I have ever found which UWMC prevails at when compared to RKT.  RKT has stated on conference calls sever times they are working on lowering the time frame and making it easier for agents since their partner division (wholesale) has just recently been focused on for growth whereas before they were focusing on direct to consumer.
4. Absolutely incorrect. Look at the forecast for UWMC for Q2.  They are expecting between 0.75 and 1.10% gain on margins when they made 2.19% in Q1.  RKT doesn't give out a division between gain on sales for wholesale and direct to consumer as an outlook, but you will see them divided out when they report earnings in Q2.  Their gain on sales is expected to be 2.65% to 2.95% which is 3 times the expectation for UWMC.   This is roughly 1% lower than last quarter, the same as UWMC.  Both companies are taking a hit due the war that UWMC started.  This is more of a problem for the entire industry since the top two dogs are fighting for market share.  But the numbers prove UWMC is losing market share to RKT, and RKT is gaining market share when compared to all other competitors.  The smaller lenders are really the ones that are suffering .
5. It's a pipe dream to believe that UWMC has won.  You're holding onto desperation.  Your CEO stated in an interview that Q1 earnings would prove they won.  They didn't.  now UWMC share owners are hoping it will show up in Q2 because the CEO came out and stated they will do better this quarter than last quarter.  RKT never once said they won't do more wholesale business this quarter than they did last quarter.  They said they would do slightly less business overall. That is because the direct to consumer originations are dropping off as refinancing slows down.  Go look at the numbers, last quarter they actually increased sales when UWMC dropped significantly on the wholesale side only.  Also if you think that realtors didn't leave UWMC long before the deadline, you're sadly mistaken.  Many left as soon as the ultimatum was announced so it definitely played a part into Q1 earnings
6. RKT did guide down, you know who else did?  UWMC.  Not only did they guide down, but they didn't even hit their estimates on revenue or profits last quarter.  RKT outperforms every earnings report.  Technically last quarter they matched the ""profits"" bottom line number, but UWMC threw a wrench into projections when they issued the ultimatum.   That caused interest rates to drop for the consumer to gain market share.
7. UWMC CEO has an excuse for everything.  The mooning of interest rates didn't affect RKT nearly as much as UWMC, and the 4 days difference in time to close on the wholesale side is no excuse to explain the miss.
8. UWMC isn't a bad company, there just happens to be a better one.  There is no one innovating more than RKT in the lending business.  While UWMC is working hard on the front side of their technologies to make them more user friendly and easier to use, RKT has mastered and finished the front end.  They are now working on the backside to speed things up which is great across all business models including autos.
9. RKT \*was\* refinance focused.  You have to keep up with the times.  This was when they were so focused on growing the really profitable side of the business direct to consumer.  It's only in recent years that they've entered the wholesale business and they are growing incredibly fast and that has become their primary focus.  Arguing that RKT is refinanced focused moreso than UWMC is an opinion you can't win.  The numbers say 75% of UWMC originations last quarter were from refinancing.

I'm not trying to harp on UWMC, I think it's a good company.  I wish RKT's CEO would step up and explain some of these things so I didn't have to look so hard into the numbers to figure out what happened each quarter.  Without a doubt UWMC's CEO are concerned about share holder value in the short term. RKT's CEO doesn't give a rats ass about what investors think in the next week, month, or possibly even year.  He knows that in 8 years from now, his mortgage business will be 3 times the market share it is now.  The auto business is peanuts right now, but It won't be forever, and it will help to make profits when the housing industry isn't selling houses.  That's about the time when UWMC will cut their dividend like every other lender does when there is a recession or slow down in the housing market.",OneofOneViper,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nx7vfo/why_rkt_is_my_1_investment_and_it_should_be_yours/h1elksf/,0.06,0.779,0.161,0.9988

2239,AMZN," The stock tumbled because gain on sales dropped and was expected to drop further next quarter.  This is due to lowering loan rate to take market share, and nothing to worry about.  AMZN was able to do tactics like this for decades and their investors never once got upset they weren’t showing profits as long as they continued to grow their market share.  

The only problem I have with RKT is that their management does not come out and explain or defend their company.

2245,RKT," I agree that the housing market is wildly competitive right now and it's a very hot market. BUT I also am seeing, and the news is reporting, that the housing  market is cooling not only due to lack of availability but due to lack of AFFORDABILITY. The housing market is inflated, there's no denying that point. Outside of stocks, real estate and housing is absolutely the most inflated asset. The only reason it has been able to inflate this quickly is due to historically low interest rate levels.

You're taking a very limited view by only considering what is happening right now and only considering what is happening in the real estate market. The economy is clearly entering a cooling off period and it's much needed. Though I am of the mindset that not only will this be a cooling period, it will be a large correction. Debt is at an all time high for individuals, businesses and governments. Interest rates cannot go lower and we're extending ourselves to razor thin margins. As inflation takes hold, interest rates will increase, spending will decrease and those unlucky enough to not have fixed rate debt will likely default.

Buying new homes in an economic downturn is not a reality for the majority of individuals. Because Rocket Mortgage focuses primarily on individuals, this is where we enter into a problem. Investors will see just that fact and ignore the reality that mortgages are typically 30 years and RKT will at least maintain their revenue, though they may not grow as quickly. Once the market recognizes the stability of RKT and it's currently depressed share price, they will invest, but that isn't going to happen tomorrow.

What may happen within the next few months is a stable price appreciation partially fueled by short coverings and partially fueled by a pent up demand for homes that was put on hold during COVID. Again, short term is going to be a rollercoaster but long term will definitely see positive movement.",LaughAdventureGame,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nx7vfo/why_rkt_is_my_1_investment_and_it_should_be_yours/h1e8deq/,0.097,0.781,0.122,0.885

2252,RKT," 5) Yeah, sure dude. A 18.2% decrease at top end, and 25,4% for Q2 decrease at low end is just a scratch. Uhu. ""Slightly less,"" you say? Then why is UWMC guiding up? 

That's strange? No? UWMC met their expectations for who would sign the addendum, and their the best in the business on closing times and ability to price competitors out. They also have a fortress of a balance sheet. Not to forget ROCKET counts Auto in their origination amount, even if it's negligible. 

  
6) You're just lying about UWMC guiding down on originations, their guiding up. It's literally in their 2nd quarter outlook  in earnings... And i keep telling you the ultimatum took effect on March 15th, but reporting for first quarter ended March 30th. I'll say it again. 

  
7) It's not 21 days, I've already told you that. And i've already told you cost to originate is much less for UWMC so interest rates affect them less. They also have more experience dealing with purchases which take longer, and are more complicated than refinances.

  
8) I disagree on the innovation side, sorry. At least on the pure play mortgage origination side.

  
9) They still are, refinance focused. Sorry. And these numbers were before UWMC made their ultimatum, which we'll see coming to effect this quarter. I don't need to win your opinion regarding the refinance focus, I just need to point to your own numbers (you know, the ones you cite).   


RKT did 36.96/313.41=11.79%. That means 11.79% of their volume was purchase for 2020.

UWMC did 42.99/182.82=23.5% of their business as purchases. This is with Jumbo and FHA turned off, or it would have been higher. 

  
This is from your graph! 

  
Also, you're pointing to TPO as the purchase savior, but you forget that margins are much lower there. But, wait then.... GASP. If Refinances shrivel up, their going to have to focus on purchases which TPO does the majority of for them, but GASP not only is it much lower margin, but they have lost access to a significant amount of brokers to work with. 

  
9) The dividend is safe, only 6% of the shares are class A shares with an economic interest. Meaning a dividend. That equates to 41.5M without the buyback reducing that. The other 94% are voting shares held by the owner, and his brother. The payout ratio is tiny, and they have a fortress of a balance sheet. Their forbearance rates are also half the average/other lenders because they focus on high quality loans. 

Why would I invest in a company with a forward P/E ratio of 12.44 where the consensus EPS forecast is 1.64: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/rkt/earnings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/rkt/earnings), and then expect explosive growth.

2265,USA," Thank you for actually doing proper research on this company. I have seen many posts and even 10+ minute long videos that don't know the basics of the company from even the past year (quoting what products are already approved/time line of when the next one will be ready.) Here is a simply breakdown of the progress of their products:  
    


Prouduct | Duration |  Finger prick calibration |External transmitter? | RnD stage | Clinical trials | Under review/approval pending | Approved EU | Approved USA
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---| 
Eversence CGM | 90 days | 2x per day | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓
Eversence XL CGM | 180 days | 1x per day | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | **Expected Q3 2021***
Eversense 365 CGM | 365 days | 1x per week* | ✓ | ✓ | Q3 2021* | 
Project Gemini | 365 days | Not yet stated/ determined  | Not needed, device fully implanted. |Under development, several years away | 

   
^^*indicats ^^a ^^projected ^^value   
   
   
The 180 day approval is, in my opinion, a huge step forward and makes the product 100 times more appealing. Having the device implanted every 90 days and still finger pricking 2 times a day is still a good commitment of time/effort, but only twice a year and a single finger prick calibration per day? That seems exponentially better, and approval is due to happen some time in the next few weeks to months. When the Eversense 365 product is finished and released, Dexcom and Libre will simply be out of the CGM business in my opinion.    
    
   
One last way-down-the-road thing to add, the CEO in a previous earning report call mentioned the ability to track ""other analytes"" in the future. This could mean tracking other vital signs/measurements with a future design. That would be earth shattering in the medical care field, 24 hour a day monitoring of patient health could revolutionize patient care. Or even athletes tracking statistics for training purposes. This is something that would be years and years away and at this point is just conjecture on my part, but it just shows that there is potential for this company beyond just diabetes care.",swohio,23,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwzmjz/sens_32_shorted_can_be_a_10x_candidate_from_here/h1chbev/,0.022,0.856,0.121,0.9863

2291,DD," The scar tissue is definitely an issue, I'm unfamiliar with how much of a potential problem that is, maybe there is data to look at from other types of subdermal or internal sensors? I realize it's not the same thing at all but we can literally install a pacemaker to run someone's heart, so surely we can figure out how to install a cgm with scarring?

Are you saying the subdermal ones are larger than the current ones that are outside the skin? They're already pretty large lol. I wore one for 10 days, it was a dexcom model.

The 7-14 days and external positioning may not be an issue for you, but there is so much data we can get from activities where currently it's very difficult to wear a cgm for. In other comment I explained how I messed up the one I wore training jiu-jitsu and I know a guy who is diabetic and his training is super limited bc he has to be careful with it.

2356,WISH," Their logistics rev is some shady accounting. They recognize gross and not net rev. So you can remove 85% of the $245 million as money that they actually banked so it’s more like $30M.

Let’s say you take an Uber for 20 bucks. Uber’s margins are 20% so you pay uber 20 bucks, they pay 16 dollars to the driver and 4 dollars uber collects and recognized as revenue. 
In the above example WISH, in their logistics space, is recognizing the entire 20 dollars that was paid to them as revenue. Though still has to pay out 16 dollars. It’s pretty shady accounting.

If uber booked gross rev like WISH does uber would had have $65B dollars in rev for just 2019. For a company whose market cap is currently 50B. Just to show you how misleading this gross rev number from Wish is in their logistics space.

Below is from their latest 10-q:

NOTE 2. DISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE
The Company generates revenue from marketplace and logistics services provided to merchants. Revenue is recognized as the Company transfers control of promised goods or services to its users in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company considers both the merchant and the user to be customers. The Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue on a gross or net basis based upon its evaluation of whether the Company obtains control of the specified goods or services by considering if it is primarily responsible for fulfillment of the promise, has inventory risk, has latitude in establishing pricing and selecting suppliers, among other factors. Based on these factors, marketplace revenue is generally recognized on a net basis and logistics revenue is generally recognized on a gross basis. Revenue excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including indirect taxes.",Caveat_Venditor_,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxluuh/wish_undervalued_and_not_a_meme_stock/h1g6de3/,0.074,0.833,0.093,0.7747

1) Currently it is the most shorted stock holding 51.37% SI of FF as reported by Ortex.   
2) It also has a lot of hype built around it with over 937 mentions on WSB discussion data as reported by Quiverqant.   
3) On top of that, the market cap is very low compared to other companies such as AMC, do not get me wrong I am not trying to downplay other companies but I am just trying to compare it to the legendary meme stock. AMC's market cap is currently 21.48B and WKHS is at only 1.86B. When AMC was at 11.45 it only had a market cap of 5.37B. 

Also AMC had less short interest more than half of what WKHS has when it popped off from this level. Say WKHS gets similar love that AMC had, it could legit shoot like crazy. If WKHS is at a 20B market cap, which is very likely due to more than double the amount of short interest, this will put WKHS shares at a valuation of around $164 per share. Even if it only gets a market cap of 5B, this will put WKHS shares at a valuation of $41 per share.

What does a high borrow rate indicate:

It means there is vigorous short sale activity in a stock, and the long side is fighting back by not providing shares to the stock borrow market. This suggests volatility as longs and shorts collide, with the winner yet to be determined.

———

Traditionally, long only, buy and hold investors buy shares from a company in an ipo, from company in a secondary offering, or from other long only shareholders who are liquidating shares for some reason.

Investors who have margin accounts, hedge funds, other sophisticated investors, or unsophisticated investors who are being preyed upon by their broker, explicitly allow their shares to be lent out to a borrower of shares.

Why would someone borrow shares of a company that someone else owns? Primarially to sell them on a stock exchange to a new buyer. This creates in effect two owners of the same share, and one “short seller.”

The short seller profits if the shares subsequently go down in price. More specifically, when he’s ready to “close out his short”, he has to go into the market and buy the borrowed shares back. If market price has gone down, he can do so at a lower price than he previously sold them, leaving him with a profit.

When you see a stock with a large borrow rate increase, or “special rate” you know the demand for borrow went up, or supply went down. Either way, it means there is vigorous short sale activity in the stock, and the long side is fighting back by not providing shares to the stock borrow market at a normal borrow rates.

This suggests upcoming volatility as longs and shorts collide, with the winner of that “battle” yet to be determined.

2555,UWMC," I'm happy to have a discussion, but I feel compelled to give you the bear case. I've been invested in UWMC since march on a person note, because I felt it offered a much more compelling value, and I'll explain why by giving Rocket's bear case. 

RKT's revenues and net income  is pretty much completely bread and butter mortgage refinance. Rocket Auto comprises a negligible revenue mix, and portion of net income. As does Rocket Homes. Sure, it'll ramp up, but there's a ongoing concern about their ability to make up or the refinance activity they will be losing.

Refinance is papering over a lot of warts, and will continue to do so in 2021. Even so, their both having to compress their margins, and simultaneously doing less volume. Their broker channel, which was the channel they were growing in (not their retail channel) is going to shrink and has shrunk and the margins for them in that area have been reduced to 100 BPS or 1 percent for Q2 2021. UWMC has effectively conducted a box out of their business in this channel with their ultimatum, and because their cost to originate is a measly 50BPS. Yes, you heard that right, UWMC's cost to originate is a measly .50 percent. The lowest of any mortgage originator. And their price matching any loan offer from 14 competitors. So, instead of just buying companies at a premium, their cutting their profit to acquire the equivalent in market share.

To add on, purchases will rise over the next 5 years, but refinance's have been pulled forward and will be negligible in the coming years (regress significantly). As rates rise, wholesale will continue to eat into the mortgage origination market share, as its cost to originate is significantly less than retail due to less fixed cost and the ability to shop around as opposed to having captive customers. 

Stickiness, or cross selling is 91%, but if people aren't coming through the door you won't be able to cross-sell them on rocket auto, etcetera. 

Don't get me wrong, it's balance sheet is strong (Like UWMC), and it will continue to make money, but it's forward p/e in 2023 is going to be an ongoing concern.

2568,RKT, OK I decided to read this. What you’re saying is all speculation and what I’m saying is a company with a successful track record will be profitable. If purchases go up then so does the value of homes thus creating higher purchase price and more equity for cash out. People refinance or move every single 5 to 7 years according to statistics. Regardless of interest rates. We all know rates are going to go up just like they did in 2018 and 19 in which I was originating loan still was making money just like RKT. Yes was 2020 an amazing year for refinancing? Absolutely. However that doesn’t take away from how much money they will continue to make as well as how much money their revenue streams will create. Your bear case is that you believe the company will fail so hard that essentially the risks they are taking are going to lead to bankruptcy. I believe that a company with a long track record of success will continue to achieve results through their innovation and technology. I believe the latter is more likely. Especially because there’s gonna be some long-term holders in this stock and if I hedge fund ever tries to bankrupt the company will just see a Gme  2.0,Thorbeans,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwymz6/whats_going_on_with_rkt_its_time_to_enter_a/h1bvxr7/,0.047,0.784,0.169,0.9786

2706,CLF," I’m a steel bull so I’m going to give you my best guess after following for last 6 months


I believe institutions went long Nucor and short CLF as a hedge against the steel industry. I suspect they did this because clf had the most debt on their balance sheets or for personal reasons because LG likes to threaten their analysts. This way if the super cycle happened or didn’t happen they could be on the right side regardless.


What they didn’t expect was CLF to rip apart their debt almost 4 years ahead of time (paid off one note 4 years early last week) and they haven’t unwound their short positions to reflect that


I suspect they’re massively underwater around 14 a share

2707,CLF," The earnings of the company are directly related to the steel price and if you think the steel price is too high, you might want to bet against the industry. The steel prices are already priced in at least to some extent and it's largely covid supply chain issues(including lockdown of some manufacturers etc) that have driven up the price of steel, not raw demand increase. If you think steel could go down in price significantly for some reason (maybe some company holding a lot of steel and will find ways to dump) it'd make sense to go short...

4:50p ET 6/10/2021-Zacks Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) Stock Sinks As Market Gains: What You Should Know Mentioned: CLF In the latest trading session, Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) closed at $22.96, marking a -1.12% move from the previous day. This change lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.47%.

Heading into today, shares of the mining company had gained 16.27% over the past month, outpacing the Basic Materials sector's loss of 2.29% and the S&P 500's loss of 0.12% in that time.

CLF will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, CLF is projected to report earnings of $1.18 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 480.65%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for  revenue is projecting net sales of $4.75 billion, up 334.97% from the year-ago period.

For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.45 per share and revenue of $18.09 billion, which would represent changes of +2517.65% and +237.83%, respectively, from the prior year.

It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for CLF. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.

Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.

The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over  the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 12.66% higher. CLF is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).

Digging into valuation, CLF currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 5.22. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 11.34, which means CLF is trading at a discount to the group.

Also, we should mention that CLF has a PEG ratio of 0.19. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Mining-Miscellaneous industry currently had  an average PEG ratio of 2.13 as of yesterday's close.

The Mining-Miscellaneous industry is part of the Basic Materials sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 175, putting it in the bottom 32% of all 250+ industries.

3037,CLF," without meme status the fair value of CLF is easily mid 30s to 40. With the upswing of the commodity supercycle it will spike to a crazy price at some point in the future I expect them to absolutely smash earnings this quarter. I would not say it is too late. I know you're looking at the year chart and thinking 'thats the top' but they acquired a lot of steel making assets from other companies this year and are now the biggest steel producer in north america, they're undervalued as is, but now they're an undervalued company that is about to have a shitstorm of economic factors drive the price of its product through the roof and shareholders benefit greatly from this increase.",SteelMafia,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxhtqc/clf_39k_yolo/h1f4vlx/,0.013,0.858,0.128,0.9141
