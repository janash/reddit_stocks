10,KSU," Right now, I'm toasting this victory with you.  Cheers!

I love following geopolitics, and the ""Mexico wins long term"" aspect of the China deterioration was plain as day to me.  I have not found any other great ways to play this (KSU held my chips).  I will probably trim my KSU position tomorrow but hold a large portion.  The beauty of KSU is/was getting a US based investment in Mexican industrial success, so it's hard to exactly replicate.

More broadly, the world is shifting rapidly as western executives reevaluate their trust in China based supply chains.  From say 1995 to 2015, the answer to ""where are we doing this large capital intensive thing"" was always China.  The obvious place to look for this shifting dynamic is US based semiconductor manufacturing, since too much supply is in Chinese missile range on Taiwan.  Intel is investing heavily down that path and is a position I've recently been building.  Them being out of favor at the cutting edge tech right now may provide a nice discount. 

I'm sure there are many other ways to play the shifting sands that are staring us in the face, and will seem obvious in hindsight like KSU.

45,USA," Hello internet. I am new to this side of the world and I would like some advice on how to invest regularly. Untill now, I traded with a single stocks in Revolut, and I recently opened a account with Interactive Brokers on the ideea of finiding a ETF for long term investment. The one most suitable I've been able to find is VUSD (mimics S&P 500, it's at about 74$/share at the moment). I am European, so USA based ETFs are not available. My scenario is that I would like most of my monthly investment money to go in a ETF, and about 30% into something with more risk, that is why I invested in single stocks untill now.  My bank offers a few investment packages, but the taxes on it are way higher that any ETF you can find on a separate broker.

\- Employed, 1500$/month after taxes (I know it sounds low, but its double the average in my country)

\- Retirement savings

\- \~20year time frame

\- I would like most of my money to be into something more on the ""safe"" side

\- About 1500$ in single stocks in Revolut (most of it is tech and finance)

\- No debts

\- Around 300$/month available for investment, will go up with time

Is my \~210$/month in VUSD and 90$/month in single stocks a decent plan or should I keep looking for another ETF? I would like to keep the most of it for long term.

 • Credit card bills are always very low, maybe a couple hundred each month.  Exro stock is long for me currently, GameStop is a yolo I’m fine with dumping and XEQT is a very recent acquisition.

I currently have no holdings 

No debts just usual living expenses $700 with rent/ult./phone/car insurance

49,AMD," Hey everyone, looking for some advice on passive forms of income to get into as a 24 y/o and where I should allocate my money to get the best returns in the next 5-7 years, and then also some tips on 20+ year investments. Thanks!

\- 24 y/o, living in USA.

\- Recent college graduation that's employed, 121k/year with a 10% bonus (not guaranteed).

\- Purchase a house as soon as possible to start building equity. Also trying to save for retirement, marriage, children etc.

\- Time horizon is 5ish years for the money to be used on housing but I also want to have long term investments with a longer time horizon (20+ years) that is separate from the retirement vehicles.

\- High risk tolerance..

\- I have about 60k in 401k/Roth with 60% allocated to large caps and the remainder in the Target 2060 blend, another 43k in a personal investment account that's holding all tech stocks (AAPL/Intel/AMD/ARK), and then about 12k in checking/HYSA.

\- I have about 22k in student loan debt. I assume this would be the first thing on my list to get rid of. However, I haven't been paying it off recently due to payments being delayed due to the pandemic. Whatever money I'd have used for that I've been investing.

Extra notes: I'm familiar with options trading. I made about 10k off my initial 2k investment last year. However, I get that anyone with 3 IQ points could've done this due to the current state of the market (all theta strategies, no WSB). But I consider it an OK form of passive income for now but I'm looking to get into other channels in the near future. Possibly real estate? Would love some input on how to get started. I've also been thinking about moving the HYSA funds into something like BlockFi which gives 6-8% returns instead of the peanuts that the HYSA gives. Obviously, this means I take on more risk but I'd love to hear about others experiences.

60,GDP," Viewpoint - I am interested in earning an expected return rather than beating an arbitrary standard.  

One of the main differences between physics and engineering is that you don't get to say ""assume no friction"" in practice.  Similarly, live markets have transaction costs, information asymmetries, errors, and price makers as well as price takers.  To me, mathematical models are useful as thinking tools rather than prescriptions.  

I do use Markowitz frontiers to calculate portfolio weights on selected ETFs.  That stated, I understand that calculated weights are both historical and estimated.  Technology changes, economies at the GDP level grow and decline, companies enter and leave the markets.  There is no guarantee of stationarity in the return generating process, even at the major index level.

I use Nutmeg, but there are other options for managed portfolios. I think Vanguard is also popular but Nutmeg has a very low barrier to entry. Obviously this is more risky than the help to buy ISA; my investments have gone down 2% since January but in theory should recover over time.

So for what I'm doing I currently have VTSAX (U.S total stock market) and VTBLAX  (U.S total bond market) as my two funds, and since my strategy is quality over quantity, I just have one stock that I'm accumulating at the minute.

So I'll pop my reasoning for buying it down below

Sony (SNE) DD. First, their image and sensing division. Currently, Sony has a staggering 53.5% share of the image sensor market with Samsung being in second with only 18.1%. Why do image sensors matter so much, well, image sensors are key for cameras, medical imaging equipment, security and surveillance, ai and robotics, barcode readers, phones (your phone will have Sony parts unless it's a Samsung) and most lucrative of them all, autonomous vehicles.This currently brings in 26% of Sony's revenue, at a 13.5% margin.                                
 
Next is Sony music, the biggest music publisher in the world. They have some of the biggest names in the industry, with artists like Ed Sheeran, 21 savage, childish gambino, DJ Khalid and more. And as music streaming grows (with Spotify reporting 29% year over year growth, and tencent music  70%), Sony will be in a great position to dish out music from its signed artists. Music makes up 16% of Sony's revenue at a margin of 20%.( I will talk more about ""other "" at the end of the DD, but just so you know, other is grouped into music).                                  

Next is playstation. Sony has managed to do something quite brilliant with playstation, they have managed a transition from physical games to digital games, why does that matter, well, digital games gives sony higher margins. But the most exciting aspect of playstation is ps plus, ps plus has went from only 4m subscribers back 6-7 years ago, to having 48m subscribers, more than HBO max, and actually, ps plus now has a bigger operating profit than Netflix, whilst Netflix had 2x the market cap of the entire Sony business. And that number of ps plus subscribers is only set to grow, with gaming being the fastest growing aspect of entertainment. It is also likely that we will give our children PlayStation's, who will in turn give their kids kids PlayStation, like how whole families come together to watch the Simpsons. You may be thinking of their competitor, Xbox, but Xbox has only really solidified in North America and western Europe, with Sony significantly beating them Asian market. Revenue 26%, operating margin 13%.                                           

Next is Sony pictures, a company you may be familiar with, they have made everything from the smurfs, Spiderman and the shark tank. You may know of the ongoing streaming war, and one of my favourite quotes is don't make wars, provide ammo, which is exactly what Sony is doing. You may not know but Netflix don't actually produce their exclusives, they out source it, and one of the studios they outsource it to is Sony, Sony has made quite a hit for Netflix, The crown, with a reported 73 million households watching it. But Sony pictures doesn't just do work for Netflix, they also have done Alex Rider, a prime exclusive and Greyhound, an apple TV exclusive. Sony pictures brought in 8% of revenue at a 9.6% margin.           

Next is Sony electronics, who make things from headphones, televisions and their world renowned camera's, there are countless videos on YouTube, of people positively speaking of their switch of Nixon to Sony, showing a high brand loyalty in the photography market. 10% of revenue at a 6.6% margin. 

Next is financial services, I can't comment too much on them, as I didn't research them thoroughly, but I can say that their revenue is  10% at a 10.6% margin. 

Now I will discuss other. So first up is Sony's quiet move into monopolising anime, the second fastest growing aspect of entertainment, they have acquired crunchy roll, funimaton, aniplex and more. This means that if will be very hard for other streaming services to compete with Sony's anime, like how it was hard to compete with Netflix. A another quote from my favourite business book is be best or be first, and Sony are doing both in the anime market.                                                                               
 
Next is Sony's car, I feel it's a marketing stunt to show off and advertise their parts to other automakers, but it really shows what Sony is capable of, with Sony audio in the car, sony image sensors, Sony infotainment and more. 

Lastly is their mobile game, I again can't comment too much on it but it is very popular in Asia and brings in 1 billon in revenue, any questions feel free to ask. It's a kind of simple DD but I can elaborate on certain sectors you are interested in

You may know of the ongoing streaming war, and one of my favourite quotes is don't make wars, provide ammo, which is exactly what Sony is doing. You may not know but Netflix don't actually produce their exclusives, they out source it, and one of the studios they outsource it to is Sony, Sony has made quite a hit for Netflix, The crown, with a reported 73 million households watching it. But Sony pictures doesn't just do work for Netflix, they also have done Alex Rider, a prime exclusive and Greyhound, an apple TV exclusive. Sony pictures brought in 8% of revenue at a 9.6% margin.           

Next is Sony electronics, who make things from headphones, televisions and their world renowned camera's, there are countless videos on YouTube, of people positively speaking of their switch of Nixon to Sony, showing a high brand loyalty in the photography market. 10% of revenue at a 6.6% margin. 

Next is financial services, I can't comment too much on them, as I didn't research them thoroughly, but I can say that their revenue is  10% at a 10.6% margin. 

Now I will discuss other. So first up is Sony's quiet move into monopolising anime, the second fastest growing aspect of entertainment, they have acquired crunchy roll, funimaton, aniplex and more. This means that if will be very hard for other streaming services to compete with Sony's anime, like how it was hard to compete with Netflix. A another quote from my favourite business book is be best or be first, and Sony are doing both in the anime market.                                                                               
 
Next is Sony's car, I feel it's a marketing stunt to show off and advertise their parts to other automakers, but it really shows what Sony is capable of, with Sony audio in the car, sony image sensors, Sony infotainment and more. 

Lastly is their mobile game, I again can't comment too much on it but it is very popular in Asia and brings in 1 billon in revenue, any questions feel free to ask. It's a kind of simple DD but I can elaborate on certain sectors you are interested in

Since I gather your a newbie would you like me to link you some educational resources or are you all good on your own?",notA_cringeyusername,3,/r/investing/comments/m9soz4/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/grp9osf/,0.024,0.865,0.111,0.9973
71,POSH," I mean, why do you think it is undervalued? This is one that has been on my radar, but it is competing in a crowded area, and one of the issues is that there are much larger and better known networks like this out there.

If POSH was tying into larger ecosystems and showing it could expand that way I might be confident enough to start a position in it, but right now I view it kind of the same way I view social networks... there is a limit to how many marketplaces (or social networks, or streaming services) people have the individual bandwidth to go to. We are reaching the point of saturation, and so in this situation the biggest or the best are going to be what survives. This one doesn't have enough of a moat or a big enough size to make me think it will be one of them right now. Its definition of ""active"" users also seems a bit suspect to me (someone buying one item over the previous 12 months does not an ""active"" user make in my opinion... if they were giving information on repeat customers and sellers that would probably be more useful).",Joeyjoejoejabadu,7,/r/investing/comments/m9i525/dd_on_poshmark_posh_why_i_think_it_is_undervalued/grnba9r/,0.013,0.866,0.12,0.974
72,DD," I really appreciate the people who post DD.  Thank you.   I am more persuaded by the ones that include discussion of downside/risks.   Gives me confidence that the poster has completely thought through the investment.   I don't speak for everyone,  just me.

73,IMO," There’s only so many people that want to spend a lot of money on a pair of never opened, limited edition Yeezys or air Jordans.
