0,EA," People are disagreeing with you here because they think that Roblox will continue to be a big hit in the future. But that shouldn’t overrule the fact that they are valued more than Take Two and EA combined. If you think a business will do well, that’s fair.

2,RBLX," In all honesty, without having done any fundamental assessment on RBLX - as a youth worker working with a wide range of kids from a diverse set of backgrounds I feel the need to say that Roblox is a freaking cash cow like you wouldn’t believe. 

The amount of money I see families pouring directly into this game on sometimes a daily basis is _insane_. I remember being utterly confused when I actually sat with one of the kids to watch what it was he was spending money on every day. 

It might be overvalued as a new stock and with no real public track record. But holy cow there is money to be made with RBLX if you’re holding long.",JustLikeJD,49,/r/stocks/comments/m3c0lk/roblox_is_insanely_overpriced/gqognd3/,0.064,0.888,0.048,-0.2247
3,BIG," A BIG tip.  Unsolicited.  

Lots of breaks. 

Use bullet points. 

Use numbers.  Express a thought. Responses then will come back with the original question. And the response is right underneath. 

This can also be super productive when dealing with back and forth emails with lawyers. 

Structuring posts, emails using this approach will change your life.

Guaranteed. :-)

Edit: added a bit more, this was actually taught to me by a 85 year old lawyer. NO time for chit chat. Right to the point. He's expensive, and respects your time and you his.

4,MC," Here are some thoughts;

Roblox hasn't been a solid game on consoles yet. Its on xbox but not ps4 or switch. Edit: The focus of this point is to show they still have growth potential due to a lack of full access currently.

Content is made by creators with a financial incentive. Imagine roblox almost like the youtube of gaming. Roblox is more a publisher or mini games. They simply offer the engine.

Children play it. Kids lack games that parents feel are safe and less violent. The other top pay for in game currency games are fortnite and GTAV. Both aren't young kid friendly and are controlled ecosystems.

Roblox is an alternative to buying toys and allows children to ""play"" vs play games. I've said it myself as a parent; get my kids robux instead of barbies/nerf guns, theyll get more milage out of it.

Minecraft failed to pull creators into it's ecosystem. They didn't give creators a ""front page"" area to host their content. Edit: To clarify, MC has one of the most dedicated playerbase of any games with a huge mod community. However, minecraft failed to give the player ""front page"" access to these creators. Instead, you're fishing around discord and online portals looking for decent content. My children aren't going to look for interesting mods. Instead, they will see the featured section on roblox, click, and drop robux immediately. Roblox offers tools to creators and pays them for their content. That's a completely different strategy than MC and gives roblox more longevity so long as they continue to innovate and spread their engine.

I'm long on roblox. If you took the children age groups of 0-18, roblox captures the bottom half of that age pretty securely. The top half still play it too. There's still room to grow and the minds over at roblox are smart. They'll have a good grasp on where the industry is going and how to evolve with it.",tinderbax,115,/r/stocks/comments/m3c0lk/roblox_is_insanely_overpriced/gqo42l2/,0.085,0.765,0.15,0.9773

22,RBLX," I'll admit, I'm pretty neutral on RBLX, but I disagree with your post.

I understand how you're trying to compare revenues between games as a justification for RBLX being overpriced, but you're essentially comparing apples to oranges.

Minecraft, Doom Eternal, and Skyrim revenues came from one time game sales resulting in the revenue. While RBLX has a completely different albeit not superior revenue model. RBLX makes money from microtransactions occuring in the game by empowering it's developers/players to create games within the game and make real money while they do it. 

RBLX has been paying out an incredible amount of money to these in-game developers, however, this strategy has allowed them to grow and maintaining a playerbase. Furthermore, they recently started working on incorporating a subscription/membership based model which should help to supplement their revenue.

Despite this, it's still hard for me to determine whether the current stock price is too high or not, but I wouldn't be so quick to take a bearish stance on RBLX based on it's comparison to the valuation of traditional video games.

TLDR; the games mentioned have different business models and should not be compared as a justification for RBLX being overvalued",potato-sword,2,/r/stocks/comments/m3c0lk/roblox_is_insanely_overpriced/gqohjie/,0.061,0.896,0.043,-0.6932

24,RBLX," Roblox is a platform with the younger userbase. You can't compare 2014 to now, things online have gone as far as 10x valuation in a lot of cases if not most.

Also, you can ride it until the music stops. My biggest concern is server inestability, possible bugs and lags with environment graphics enhance (more graphic required as well) and controversial decision-making.

Compare Apple to Netflix the latter is 5 times the value on the market yet Apple is one of the biggest companies in the world. Lastly how is Tesla worth $700 dollars when it makes little profit. It’s valued at $700 because of Musk and his brand and has nothing to do with the actual fundamentals of Tesla or it’s commercial model. I agree that $70 is a high price but it’s no more obsecure than the others I’ve just mentioned.

58,RBLX," I think a lot of people are bearish because trying to invest in something that makes money off of young children proves time and time again to be near impossible to do longterm

Pick ANYTHING that was super popular and making tons of money with kids 6-12 a decade ago and tell me if its success has gone up? Kids interests are so wildly unpredictable that pretty much the only way to pick a good investment for that sector is to look with the benefit of hindsight 

I really hope im wrong and people can make some dough on roblox, but personally i wont touch a company that makes most if not all of their money from young kids. I think theres a good possibility that the kids will all move on in a couple years leaving a lot of bagholders. 

I mean hell, what if FortNite had an IPO or DPO in the hight of its popularity? Thats a game that dominated EVERYONE and nobody saw the decline coming, especially with kids. Sure the game still makes money but if the company had an IPO in the hight of their success (like roblox) there would be a massive massive boom on word of mouth and hype alone (also, see roblox) before trading sideways at a stupid valuation or continuing to rise for a year or two before tanking off a cliff. Fortnite is still popular though, most games dont die immediately, but most of their playerbase felt it get stale and moved on, meaning the share price would be considerably lower than it was at launch, *because they launched at their peak sales*

I know that didnt happen and is entirely speculation but its still my reasoning as to why i dont want to jump on RBLX and im sure some others feel the same. Just trying to give some insight as to why people might be bearish, i dont think its all because people think the game isn’t popular, personally im not investing in anything thats reliant on children staying interested in it

I wish the best of luck to anyone invested in RBLX, but to me, it just feels too closely to trying to time the market, and i dont fuck with that

Edit: my point isnt that its impossible for roblox to see massive growth, its that its a massive gamble because of its demographic. Im not willing to gamble on a stock thats dependant on keeping young children interested and engaged for years, because the fact is most of those companies fail miserably after a couple years of raging success. Im not bearish because its roblox, im bearish on any company that primarily targets kids.

Roblox isn’t a company that be compared to traditional publisher like EA or Take Two. Taditional publishers have to commit vast resources to earn each $70/unit sold and hope to get some trailing MTX residuals. Roblox focuses on perfecting their current platform to get outside creators to create content for them, which lowers the cost per dollar earned. 

The Roblox model injects a wild amount of creative energy into the games. [Just a simple YouTube search shows the platform can support a ton of different game types. ](https://youtu.be/ELDLfkMhRFI). 

Roblox has also been offering incentives for creators to stretch the limits of the game engine with Showcases, [with the game able to create some good looking photo-realistic environments. ](https://youtu.be/IsEOH8B51NU). While these showcases are more tech demo then playable game, it’s amazing how far the engine can be stretched. Plus I can easily see showcases being a way to build a reliable pool of new recruits for the company. 

But the reason I know Roblox has legs, is that the demand for Roblox is feverishly high from its core audience: kids. 

Kids will do anything for Robux. They’ll do chores and do their homework for Robux. My co-worker had to ground their kids when they stole their credit card for Robux. My niece begs me for Robux daily. And the thing is, is that parents will freely give Robux out because Roblox is one of the safest kid-friendly environments out there, next to Nintendo, and Roblox has some similar safety measures they stole from Big N. 

As for me and me personally, I’ll be after the options market. I’m hoping for some good premiums on puts and calls, and harvest some good theta out of RBLX.

And the thing is, is that parents will freely give Robux out because Roblox is one of the safest kid-friendly environments out there, next to Nintendo, and Roblox has some similar safety measures they stole from Big N. 

As for me and me personally, I’ll be after the options market. I’m hoping for some good premiums on puts and calls, and harvest some good theta out of RBLX.

66,AI," I'm definitely not as experienced as ARK manager in managing funds, but I have been programming and been in the machine learning/data science realm since 2009. I subscribed and listened to her YouTube videos like this one [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzPzz24UN3c]. 

In that particular video above, she is massively overestimating the potential of the autonomous driving technology and machine learning. The metric she was using in that video (I hope I shared the link to the right video; I have listened to quite a few...) was ""cost of training"". That is, in my personal opinion, is not the correct way to measure the impact of ML (even if we assume that her assertion that the cost of training models is going down by a lot, which is debatable from my observation); ""cost per XXX"" could be a legit way to measure things in certain industry (esp. industries that produces tangible stuff), but not in AI/ML. As a result, I decided not to buy her ARKK fund and others. Having said that, I bought ARKF because I believe that the digital transformation of currency will just grow bigger. On the other hand, I would be very, very surprised to see us having fully autonomous cars (level 5 or even level 4) in the next decade or two.",plartoo,2,/r/stocks/comments/m3c0lk/roblox_is_insanely_overpriced/gqpxtrq/,0.0,0.897,0.103,0.9691

70,RBLX, I think the distinction is lost on most people. DPO just means bankers aren't buying the stock at IPO price and selling it to you at opening price. Instead existing shareholders are selling to you at open price which is much more fair imo. Bankers taking a cut isn't entirely wrong if they out the work into promoting the stock and ensuring the offering is sold or oversubscribed but with popular names like RBLX it's just a wrought where bankers make a huge commission followed by their clients getting an instant 40-100% unrealised gain on opening day,beefstake,27,/r/stocks/comments/m3c0lk/roblox_is_insanely_overpriced/gqohlm1/,0.03,0.771,0.199,0.9537

86,ATH," There is 100% a bubble, but it's a government backed bubble. Here in Canada, our real estate prices are insane but the longer I think about it, it's similar to what's going on with the stock market. Loose monetary policy, record low interest rates, quantitative easing, and other policies have created an ""everything bubble"" and a highly speculative market. As long as the Feds are willing to subsidize some of the market risk at the expense of taxpayer money, the bubble might continue for 2, 5, even 20 years. It's a wild stock market right now where Tesla has a P/E of 1100, Chipotle, Cheesecake Factory, Live Nation, and other Covid recovery stocks are at ATH, penny stocks have greater valuations than some established companies, and more companies having volatile swings. Fundamentals have been thrown out and investors have become more greedy knowing that the Feds will back them up during economic downturns. It's a government policy problem, not just a stock market problem because the valuations of everything from equities, bonds, housing, even crypto has ran up in the last decade. 

It's an unprecedented time in history and while I enjoyed the 100% gains last year, I worry what this will do to the next generation. The rich have seen their wealth increase exponentially while the middle class gets smaller and poor people get absolutely fucked. Assets disproportionately benefit the upper class who owns the means of production, and policies in the last 30 years culminated in pre-WW2 levels of wealth inequality. 

At the end of the day, the Feds hands are tied. The moment they announce an interest rate rise, or the selling of purchased bonds, the stock market will tank as investors who are used to stimulus backing are left to dry. Since the economy is tied to this market, it will create a recession like we have never seen and I fear the societal repercussions of such a move. Another factor now is China, and no doubt if the US sees a Japan style stagnation, investors will flock to an economically assertive China. Because of all this, I think the bubble will just be a hot potato thrown around by Democrats and Republicans until something drastic happens.",StarryNight321,161,/r/stocks/comments/m397pi/i_havent_seen_so_many_bullish_indicators_in_past/gqo1tto/,0.108,0.751,0.14,0.8961

108,CC," Definitely. Although (and I admit to being a natural pessimist so this could be wrong) personally I don't believe any economy is equipped to deal with what CC is going to throw at us. I believe its going to be like being attacked from all 360 degrees at the same time.

I believe that by the end of the century there is a non-zero chance of total economic and subsequent societal collapse. Again though I am a pretty pessimist person so I'd love to be wrong here.

In the short term I'm just going to keep investing and taking advantage of whatever opportunities the coming years present and hopefully some good comes from that.",Your_Old_Pal_Hunter,9,/r/stocks/comments/m397pi/i_havent_seen_so_many_bullish_indicators_in_past/gqom6ui/,0.107,0.673,0.22,0.9198
109,CC," > Covid seemed like a great time for the economy to refocus it's efforts from oil and ffs to more green technology. A chance to change about the old system to one that'll prepare us better. Not sure how well this will be done but I know Trudeau and Biden have mentioned it.

Yeah exactly, the term 'Great reset' has been thrown around a lot this past year and while that initially sounds quite ominous I actually think it could be a very good thing. Hopefully Covid is the wake up call to how fragile the modern way of life actually is.

> You mentioned 2030ish and I agree this will be a huge tipping point in global climate relations but I'm curious which aspects you think would affect the global economy. Are you thinking things like drought and famine or mostly displacement and natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods.

The thing that primarily worries me about CC is that the more I learn about it at college or through articles and general reading the more I realise how little we know and how difficult it is to predict what is going to happen.

Natural disasters like you mentioned will certainly get worse as global temps increase. I believe about 1C of global temp increase is about the equivalent of 1 million nucear bombs worth of energy being added to global weather systems. So the hotter the planet gets the bigger the pool of energy weather events have to power them (thats not exactly how weather works but a simple way to think about it). [This article is a good read related to that](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/07/global-warming-of-oceans-equivalent-to-an-atomic-bomb-per-second).

But weather is just 1 aspect of many. Diseases and pandemics or epidemics will become more common. [This research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X16301203) talks about how mosquitos carrying malaria previously only found in Africa have become more common in Southern Europe over the past 20 years as Europe has gotten hotter so mosquitos can survive there in summer.

An event that will effect me personally as a UK resident is the [weakening of the Atlantic gulf stream](https://discord.com/channels/@me/581181965235912715/817162079311888415) that this article does a fantastic job at explaining (**Read this**) where melting ice from Greenland will prevent warm currents of water and air from reaching the British isles and will cause our mild winters to become extreme, i.e. minus double digit C winters which the UK and our infrastructure is absolutely not prepared for and will certainly cause a lot of deaths especially of elderly people.

Thats just a few examples of the wide range of difficult to foresee consequences of CC. Personally I believe that at a certain point when each continent is facing its own unique challenge societies will start to break down in which case the economy and stock market will be the least of our worries.
I don't know if i'd say this is extinction level stuff yet but if we don't change our actions soon then we definitely won't be living as luxuriously as we're all living right now.

All just my take on things though, as I said previously I am pretty pessimistic in general.

111,GME," I'm pretty new to investing, I began researching it before xmas but the whole GME thing has got me properly into it so i'm by no means someone you should be taking advice from.

However, my plan at the moment is just to build my portfolio for the next few years. I'm doing 10% of my monthly wage into investments (ETFs, tech companies, EV companies, Green energy companies and any other i feel might do well), 10% into crypto (5% in BTC, 5% in ETH) and 10% is going straight into my savings isa for a rainy day.

From the relatively small amount of research i've done and the current state of things it seems like a recession is on the horizon and that recessions are basically firesales for investors. Im gonna build my capital and then put it into the market if/when that next recession hits.",Your_Old_Pal_Hunter,2,/r/stocks/comments/m397pi/i_havent_seen_so_many_bullish_indicators_in_past/gqp0ubc/,0.077,0.864,0.059,-0.5853
112,TFSA," ^ This 100%, in Canada, the equivalent of this would be to put 3-6 months of expenses into a savings account, pay off loans that accrue interest, and use the rest of the money to max out your TFSA and invest it into VOO. After, start adding to your RRSP. Invest when you're young so you can maximize growth for other financial goals such as buying a house. Other than that, finding a worthwhile career is important.

There's always the case for a bubble, but with government policies supporting massive growth that have greatly benefitted the rich, the only real way for regular people like us to get in on this is to ride their coattails. If something does give, you'll be fucked regardless of whether you invested in stocks or not. The ones waiting on the sidelines because they think stocks are overvalued or are timing a crash will get burned the most, similar to how many people in Canada are completely priced out of the housing market now because they spent years 5, 10, or 20 years waiting for a downturn that never happened.",StarryNight321,3,/r/stocks/comments/m397pi/i_havent_seen_so_many_bullish_indicators_in_past/gqoxzir/,0.053,0.816,0.13,0.9305

114,CC," Ya I agree with everything you said. I'm not too sure if you guys have ticks over in the UK that carry Lyme disease but because of CC ticks aren't dying out in the winter over here and have been migrating north where they usually wouldn't be too abundant.

You mentioned that we really don't have any idea what will happen other than educated guesses which is so true.

116,CVS," I like bank stocks a lot. I think there are large companies trading at fair value. For example BRK is my hedge against a big sell off. I think CVS is another example where it trades so close to book value that in a sell off it’s a great example of a secure place to put money. 

Obviously a big sell off would most likely hurt all stocks in the short run.

A childhood friend introduced me to trading before GameStop was taking off, and telling me about how he was investing in weed stocks. I listened to his DD and decided I would throw some money into a new account and see what happened. He said he had done research into these companies and managed to make a profit in the last year. Then GameStop took off. I've purchased at every single entry level, even managed to get out and then back in a good times to make a little profit, learn about wash sales, and rolled some into a long-term IRA.

174,ELA," I'm also a high school teacher, albeit in ELA and not business/econ. I know both the state I teach in and the one in which I grew up now require personal finance classes to graduate. Back when I was in HS (mid-2000s), the personal finance class was called ""Consumer Math"" and it was pretty much widely understood to be a blowoff class for kids who failed the primary math courses to make up credit. It was not a requirement in my day. I totally understand what you're saying, and I can relate when I've tried to teach some kind of heady or advanced topics to my students.

For things like this, you have to come up with a unique and innovative way to present it to students. One of the most memorable lessons in my school days was my 5th grade math teacher's introduction to our unit on interest. He walked into the room silently holding one of those plastic index card boxes. Holding it up, he said, ""Inside this box is one of the most dangerous items on the planet,"" and had us guess what it was. Most of the guesses were a weapon like a gun or knife, a venomous spider or insect, some kind of poison, stuff you would imagine 10 year olds to guess. He then opened up the box and procured... a credit card. This was back in the late 90s, but I remember the lesson like it was yesterday. He knew we wouldn't normally give much of a shit about calculating interest, so he found a way to make it interesting and relatable, focusing the whole unit on how dangerous credit cards and high-interest loans are.

My advice to you is to keep going, because I'm sick and tired of people my age going *nObOdY tAuGhT mE tHiS iN sChOol*, so someone needs to be there to say, ""Yes we did, you just didn't pay attention!""

If for example an experienced investor and an experienced trader both bought TSLA at $800 and it dropped down, the investor knows to hold because they believe it will go back up in the long term. TSLA then plummets to $500, they would then be down $300/share in their position, until the price goes back up at some undefined point in the future. The trader would see the stock begin to drop, evaluate the shorter term risk, exit their position with minimal losses, and wait to see if it eventually turns back up again and ride it back up to the top.

186,SP," Not necessarily. Fees would likely go lower as more money managers compete for clients. We have seen this trend for the last 40 years, culminating with fidelity offering zero-fee mutual funds.

As far as a 401k being superior, it absolutely is, provided that you start young. Pension programs used to be pretty nice (my grandfather earned one from Trane Company), but he would have had a much wealthier retirement if would have just invested 15% of his meager income in a total market or SP 500 index in an 401k/IRA.

I’m from BC and I find that our public schools are really, really bad :( the textbooks were nearly two decades older than the seniors and the teachers were always short staffed, too many kids in a class etc. Alberta and the east coast seem to have a way better education. BC reminds me a lot of American schools. I went to a private school in BC for a few years and then had to switch to public school and I was an entire year ahead than all the other kids! Some were still learning basic French! It was jaw dropping. And this private school wasn’t anything fancy at all.

206,AAPL," I buy dips or enter options positions on them at staggered intervals.  At least 3, sometimes 5-6 depending on overall market conditions, volatility, my available cash, and my portfolio risk level.

Red just means a discount sale and removing risk from the stock when its been hammered hard like TSLA or ARKs were.

If it went up I was going to sell out, but if it went down and never went back up I would only be out $100. That was my ""Gambling"" money. 

Sure, I could look at it as ""Why didn't I sell my house and put everything in GME to sell at the peak?"" but what good would that do? it could have stayed around $50 for years. The business model is failing and while they announced some new plans it doesn't justify the huge increase.

I look at it as ""This is what I am prepared to lose and any and all stocks could go down at any time."" That's not quite true, but it helps me focus on profits.

228,VERY," So I dont understand. Dollar cost averaging down on a company you think has a great future is one of the smartest decisions you can make no? Studies shouldn't be necessary. 

If you believe in what you are investing in, a dip should say that this is a bargain for you. 

Now I've only been investing for a VERY short time but that is the one truth I have learned. I have a few straight gambles, some safe plays, and one company I ABSOLUTELY believe will at least 7x in the next 3 years. I bought everything I could afford of that last company during this most recent dip. Its not much, but it's what my poor ass can afford. 

If you are dollar cost averaging down on stocks that are gambles? That may be a problem as they are gambles to begin with.

232,BB," Its caught up in the meme crowd. 

BB

They have some amazing fundamentals, are in a great space, are trading low, have fantastic news coming out on a pretty regular basis, and have a massive moat in their industry. 

The reason they are undervalued is twofold. 1) large swaths of investors still see them as a phone company (changing rapidly so this will be gone in the not so distant future) and 2) they have not truly turned a profit in the last few years. Investors care about 1 thing. Making money. Blackberry has not proved they can do so yet. 

I FIRMLY believe they will be able to turn a profit. Their entire model and everything they are doing looks like foundation work for the next step. In my mind the next step is is with IVY. I have faith the company will be huge in the EV market. 

So I buy little bits and pieces of the company with every paycheck. I was happy about the correction the past few weeks as I sold out of some very poor decisions I made when I first started trading and bought more BB. Made up about 80% of my losses from the bad trades. 

There are a lot of people who dont believe in BB. And for very good reasons. their critiques of the company are valid. But I have faith so I see downturns as a chance to buy of something I believe in. I wouldnt call this a gamble play as I dont do options, I have only bought actual stocks. So the value may go down if they loss market share, but I will never truly zero out. 

From my new mind, that's what investing is all about. Find companies you actually believe in and then root for them to succeed with you dollars.",Ka11adin,12,/r/stocks/comments/m33slr/how_do_you_get_over_beating_yourself_up_for_not/gqmuw98/,0.057,0.833,0.11,0.9235

236,AAPL," It looks like you've been paying attention to the market in the last few months based on your post history, but that could be wrong. I'll say this as someone who started in late 2019 a day has learned some lessons the hard way and others an easier way.

You'll grow a thicker skin and start to recognize that this happens. Make a plan for your trade and stick to it. If you plan to hold longer term, the drop is fine... it'll grow back, especially for companies like AAPL. If you're more on the speculative side it sounds like you need to use your stop losses more and better. You wouldn't have gone from +20 to -10, you would've sold at +12 and had cash ready to buy the dip. 

Its certainly hard to be bullish while watching everything drop, but if you're risk avoidant wait for a more solid signal that its slowed, then buy. Just make a plan and stick to it. If you're plan didn't include buying the dip, don't be upset that you didn't win the 'game' you never decided to play. 

As someone who prefers speculation, I'd prefer some profits now instead of maybe getting more later after its been red for a bit.

237,BB," Not a single solitary clue. Honestly I hope they slow roll through this year up until the IVY earnings start to hit their spreadsheets. That way I can build my position through out the year. 

This earnings report at the end of the month goes well? 15-20? That probably optimistic. This earning report shows more of the same? I'd be surprised if it hit 15 by EOY. But again it all depends if BB can show they can turn all this amazing news into money.

238,BB," There are some amazing DDs on BB here on reddit. I would highly suggest you check some of them out as they are far better than I am at researching and finding out about a company. 

Short list, BB is a cybersecurity company, one of the only ones who is certified to be used by the government in their own communication networks as well as in EVs. They have a unique type of real time operating system that allows security by essentially having a bunch of different systems running separately. It's hard to explain as I'm not well versed in the technology of it, but it seems to work and work well. 

BB QNX (their EV software) is in 61% of EVs currently and they are contracted with something like 70% of auto makers (yes most of the big ones) to use QNX. 

Also, on cybersecurity, we just had a ton of big profile hacks that caused who knows how much damage. BB was completely unaffected. Almost every one of their major competitors got hacked. They did not. It has been a major selling point for BB lately and hopes are that it shows up on the balance sheet at the end of the month. 

Now, bearish case, BB has been transforming from phones into cybersecurity over the past 7 years or so. You get a little identity crisis when that happens. That could go on for a bit longer, or it could finish up in the next few years we are all unsure. 

The CEO, Chen, has been CEO for the past 7 or 8 years and BB has consistently underperformed at earnings under his leadership. Mountains of good news comes out and.... nothing. They seem to have a hard time monetizing their leverage that they have built up. So the bearish case is ""they haven't made money under this same guy for years with similar good news, I'll wait till they can show they can earn a profit"". To make matters worse, BB is moving into a cluttered field of competition that is ripe with big names. Their major competitors in their field are Tesla, Google, and Apple, among others. Not names you want to get into a tussle with. 

Lastly, the big thing with me is the new CEO of Amazon as of this coming September believes in BB so much he partnered with them to create the future of Amazon. IVY is a software to use in the EVs for warehouses and deliveries for Amazon. This wont show up on balance sheets for 2 or 3 years according to Chen. 

Overall, seems like a solid play in my eyes. Bit gambly but they seem to have turned a corner recently and have signed up with some big names and their product shows significantly more strength than the competitions. 

Dont take my word for it though, I quite literally know NOTHING about stocks and am only trying to save so I can retire at 55. If BB rockets then ill be just as excited as everyone else.

I’m personally waiting until 8 to re-enter a trade, but happy for all the buy and holders who hopefully prove me wrong. I still think they need a strong earnings report to put us in an uptrend. My guess is it trades sideways, consolidates, and then picks a direction based off fundamentals.

Editing to say it does look like it is picking up the long term trend line from the initial move up before it meme’d out.

It’s a good question and the fact that you’re asking it at all means you’re thinking critically about things.

Personally, I thought I read something in the rules about “no posts about Robinhood”. I think a lot of folks are harboring resentment because of the recent trade restrictions that burned a lot of new investors. Their business model couldn’t handle the growth and frequency of the Reddit rally but the little guys paid the price.

To be fair I do like the interface but, having used Webull, RH, and E*TRADE, I like Webull WAY more than RH. May be more of a personal preference but the charting tools in Webull have been very fun. You can also make custom dashboards which has been helpful for organization.

They have a numerous amount of contracts through governments for propulsion, they make aeronautical turbines/pumps/engines, I'm sure they own the IP on a ""few"" things :D I imagine the company is actually worth a fortune. They also have extensive knowledge of special paints and polymers for coatings in their car lines... I mean, they have a massive spread across their portfolio. I'm sure with some better attention to their maintenance(shipping and other manufacture just gets better and better as technology gets better) and with a long term outlook, you could see some good growth over a long period of time with the Jet engines and especially with innovations around the horizon?

389,AI," For me it is Google.  But really all the big 5 tech companies are ""forever"" stocks.     Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and then Facebook.  In that order.   

Google just has so many things yet to be monetized.   Last quarter they put up over 40% growth in profits.  Which is incredible but more important was the 20%+ top line growth without any end in site.   Google just has tons and tons of runway.

So for example only Alphabet/Google is capable of

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ0GvsQeak&feature=youtu.be

But also leads in every layer of the AI/ML stack from silicon all the way up.   Google TPUs have been record setting with both training and inference at scale.    Google leads in algorithms as shown by papers accepted at NeurlIPS.   

Data is the obvious one where nobody has the data that Google has.  Plus the most valuable data.   Facebook it is fake data because it is how you want to represent yourself.  Versus Google it is your private data.

It has been an intensely challenging year and sentiment is at an all time low, but everything from the concept to the balance sheet has me so convicted that it is my only position (other than GME short-term, which I will use to expand this position). Space and hypersonic travel is undoubtedly the future, and something that will drastically change the world in my lifetime, so in my opinion going all in on the ground floor is worth it - even if it is still years off. I’d do the same if Virgin Hyperloop or Orbit became publicly traded too.

I don’t think they’ll have too much trouble in the low and mid level TV market, but premium TVs with high spending consumers will be dominated by those three other companies, all of whom have much deeper war chests than Roku and more expansive ecosystems that they can integrate with.

611,UI," I've used the eversense system before and I own shares - that being said I am 100% bullish on this company.   
The biggest drawbacks for this company are insurance coverage and their UI. Dexcom ($DXCM) is widely covered in the United States which makes it the first choice for providers and patients. The $SENS procedure is a joke - 10 minutes in and out. They are slightly more accurate than their competitors, but because of their fluorescent technology compared to Dexcoms tech the standard deviation of blood sugars is higher with eversense. Until more insurance companies adopt the system it will remain an unviable option for lots of patients.   
Additionally, their UI is complete garbage and needs a complete overhaul. This is an easy fix but a danger that will send first time users running for the hills.

In my opinion if a sensor is not able to communicate with a pump directly it is useless/an unnecessary step.  I use the 630, which receives data from the sensor, provides alerts, generates quick bolus patterns based on carb/levels and so on.  I find it to be incredibly reliable and helpful,  but would not trust it to perform any bolus function.

It's been awhile since I looked at the OmniPod....how do you command bolus amounts or modify basal rates based on activity levels,etc?  It is an all in one pump/infusion set, so I assume you use a transmitter.   A phone or proprietary remote?

Today RIDE dropped 17% this morning on news that Hindenburg is shorting the stock.

Hindenburg's claim is:

""Our conversations with former employees, business partners and an extensive document review show that the company's orders are largely fictitious and used as a prop to raise capital and confer legitimacy,"" the short seller said.

In January, Ohio-based Lordstown claimed more than 100,000 pre-orders from fleet operators for its proposed all-electric truck. It touts a 250-mile range for the Lordstown Endurance and says it's on track to start producing the EV this September.

But former employees estimate the electric truck is ""3-4 years away from production, if it ever gets there,"" [**Hindenburg said in its scathing report**](https://hindenburgresearch.com/lordstown/). The EV ""spontaneously combusted"" in its very first road test, it alleged.

[https://www.investors.com/news/ride-stock-short-seller-hindenburg-adds-lordstown-hit-list/](https://www.investors.com/news/ride-stock-short-seller-hindenburg-adds-lordstown-hit-list/)

Hindenburg did expose NKLA, but they clearly have motivation for the stock to drop.

Considering it already has a factory with no debt thanks to the GM deal, at $15, a $2.5B market cap seems like not much risk.

Is it possible they don't have 100,000 trucks back ordered? Maybe. But an Endurance at $50k-$60k will probably sell very well.

In terms of not having a working truck, we'll find out with the San Felipe 250 in April.

Today RIDE dropped 17% this morning on news that Hindenburg is shorting the stock.

Hindenburg's claim is:

""Our conversations with former employees, business partners and an extensive document review show that the company's orders are largely fictitious and used as a prop to raise capital and confer legitimacy,"" the short seller said.

In January, Ohio-based Lordstown claimed more than 100,000 pre-orders from fleet operators for its proposed all-electric truck. It touts a 250-mile range for the Lordstown Endurance and says it's on track to start producing the EV this September.

But former employees estimate the electric truck is ""3-4 years away from production, if it ever gets there,"" [**Hindenburg said in its scathing report**](https://hindenburgresearch.com/lordstown/). The EV ""spontaneously combusted"" in its very first road test, it alleged.

[https://www.investors.com/news/ride-stock-short-seller-hindenburg-adds-lordstown-hit-list/](https://www.investors.com/news/ride-stock-short-seller-hindenburg-adds-lordstown-hit-list/)

Hindenburg did expose NKLA, but they clearly have motivation for the stock to drop.

Considering it already has a factory with no debt thanks to the GM deal, at $15, a $2.5B market cap seems like not much risk.

Is it possible they don't have 100,000 trucks back ordered? Maybe. But an Endurance at $50k-$60k will probably sell very well.

In terms of not having a working truck, we'll find out with the San Felipe 250 in April.

653,TECH," I think people are thinking too one dimensionally with regards to correction behavior. 

Stock crashes down fast, stock melts up fast. 

based on the behavior of past corrections/crashes, any of the below could happen: 

* past few days could be a bull trap, and Tech will crash further after
* Tech suddenly trades sideways for 3 more months, then melts up to 14,000, or maybe suddenly crashes 
* Tech melts up almost to NASDAQ 14,500, everyone is happy and confident, vaccines are out, stimmy checks out, then TECH crashes again in 1 month back down to 12,000
* etc etc

Point is,  alot more than ""stock go up and down like a nice little V"" could happen, and probably will happen",metallica11,9,/r/stocks/comments/m3evqw/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_mar/gqoonsz/,0.041,0.86,0.099,0.802

655,GME," The other day I decided to, like a dummy, buy GME thinking I might snag a few bucks while the hype was strong. My intention was to sell it at the end of the day planning on something happening as per usual. I was up a grand in a few hours and was about to sell when all of a sudden the drop happened. Now down over a grand, watched it come back up slowly and fart around all day yesterday. Was finally able to break even this morning and got out. I feel like a naive idiot that fell for FOMO. Learned a valuable lesson there. Today even in spite of tech being down I feel pretty good. Yesterday also confirmed for us that tech is ready to thrive as soon as interest rates chill out.

Personally, I chose ETH as a result of the possibilities on the chain, and as a “safe” altcoin. It’s the second highest market cap behind BTC and tends to move in a very correlated way.

Plenty of people choose other altcoins to taste - eg PolkaDot (DOT), Cardano (ADA) etc - as building upon the possibilities of ETH, but without the high “gas” fees. I personally like ADA, but then I got in comparatively low before turning a profit. Also worth noting it’s the third highest market cap.

Key to all of this is acknowledging crypto has massive volatility, and we’re currently at an ATH. While crypto and BTC in particular has consistently smashed ATH, consider your own risk tolerance. If you buy in now for the long term future, be prepared to see a big drop before it gets back to new ATHs. Consider whether you’d feel more comfortable putting money in on a dip, or prefer to DCA and ignore movements altogether.

I personally like getting in to a crypto (so I’m in for the long term trend to the right), but then adding to the position during significant dips / crashes.

I noticed my portfolio was quite lacking in a few sectors I knew spit about like finance, energy, and utilities so I used the dip last week as a chance to consolidate a bit of my tech and lot of deadweight positions I didn’t believe in anymore into multiple VTI shares. Gives me more consistency as well as chunks of other sectors without having to constantly track them. I took a closer look at my managed Roth IRA and realized its core asset is VTI and it’s racked up almost a 1000 bucks since October when I got it opened so it’s definitely consistent.

814,IRR," I think it depends less on the frequency of your trading and more on your IRR and CAGR performance.

If you're not particularly efficient at compounding annual returns, then you probably are better off just keeping that chunk of money in an S&P index fund for years in which case it doesn't matter which account you hold it in.

If you're a shrewd investor, beating the S&P year in and year out, generating some fairly large IRR (read: not day trading), then there's a significant tax advantage the more years you let those untaxed gains compound... but that also means you're not incurring high turnover anyway.

I just don't see frequent trading as particularly efficient either way, because it's a lot of time and risk for relatively little reward.  It's not the taxes that are the problem.",th3cr1t1c,1,/r/stocks/comments/m3i1w3/shouldnt_i_shortterm_and_midterm_trade_in_my_roth/gqph73s/,0.098,0.826,0.076,-0.4895

Pick a riskier and higher growth potential stock for your Roth, and it doesn't pan out and you lose money.

But when I put in my $6k for this year I broke my plan and put 10% on weed just short of the top of that APHA spike. I have no idea what came over me, but I regretted it within hours. And who knows, maybe it will work out in the long run, but it really doesn’t fit with my plan and I definitely would use it for tax loss harvesting if it was in my taxable account. I also realized that even a small loss due to stupidity annoys me a lot more when it is an account where the contribution is finite.

841,DD," > If you check page 77, they talk about how they believe (and they are right, I feel) that because of the way they are forced to recognize revenue that bookings is a superior method of looking at their trends of success. Simply, they can't recognize the money someone uses to buy their Robux until that person does one of two things. To recognize the money exchanged for Robux as revneue the user who bought the Robux then has to satisfy one of two conditions. They have to either buy a durable item like a piece of clothing off of the marketplace, or they have to buy AND consume something like an in-game potion. Until this is done, they can't call it revenue much like a lot of gift card type deals. 

This here is so critical to understanding the finances of this company, and although I do believe the company is over valued and I personally won't be investing in ROBLOX, whenever I see people call it unprofitable and just leave it at that, I just sigh at their stupidity. I've played ROBLOX on and off ever since I was a kid in 2012. I enjoyed the trading of limited and limited u items on the game (limited supply items unlike most items sold on the catalog) and I enjoyed playing and selling them and building up an in game 'portfolio and net worth', it was just fun to do as a kid even into my late teens. At my peak on ROBLOX I got up to 10m in in game value (robux) and finally I realized how much real world currency I could get for my in game portfolio of items and robux. I began selling on a third party market place called rbx (dot) place where I sold all of my items and robux for over 20k USD before starting to buy items and robux off of other traders in the trading community and reselling them for a profit. All in by the time I stopped buying and reselling things on roblox I made an overall profit of 60k+ CAD from the ages of 16-19, which I think is pretty insane especially since a lot of this I earned while playing the game casually as a child. 

The amount of user growth I have seen in ROBLOX since 2012 is insane. It is not a game, it is a gaming PLATFORM. There are millions of games you can play within their platform, some good, and some bad with a few great games in between. You can play a copied version of minecraft, a copied version of call of duty, a copied version of anything really, or you can their more popular role playing games aimed for young children. I remember back in 2012-2014 when having 5000 concurrent players in any one game was insane, now you have games like 'adopt me' that average 500,000 concurrent players at any given time. The growth has truly been insane. 

> Basically put, 68% of their daily active users were outside of the US and Canada regions. These include significant proven growth that's happened in France, South Korea, Germany, and other places besides. 

Another interesting point has been their international growth. They've only recently gone big international. Until around 2018 they really were almost exclusively Canada and USA centric, but that's changing. They're not seeing explosive growth international as well. Quite interesting when you're playing a game on their platform and start seeing multiple languages being spoken haha, it's definitely a new thing for me to see given from 2012 to 2018 the only languages you ever saw other than English was the occasional French and Spanish from Mexican and French Canadian players.

Didn't know this myself, as I don't actively play anymore, but if they can hit it off in China that will definitely be huge. 

> I think people reach to compare Roblox to Unity because they can't fathom understanding this company without these comparisons. Just because they sell entertainment in the form of gaming at the end, what goes into it is completely different. Its like buying your own cameras and shit compared to just using Netflix's shit to make a movie and then giving them a cut at the end of the day. 

Amazing point. I personally know some game developers on ROBLOX. I won't use any names or even in-game names, but I knew of a teen from England who made a game that managed tens of thousands of concurrent players and her game was pulling in tens of thousands a month in profit without her needing to spend any money on hosting services or anything. All she had to put in was her time and effort (and a decent PC to make the development process easier). It's also interesting taken into account that a lot of the game developers are young adults. 

> Roblox has components of a social network 

I am curious to see what ROBLOXs plans are in terms of becoming a social media platform as well as a gaming platform. Back when I was most active on the website they had a set of forums sort of like reddit but with preset sub forums that couldn't be edited. They had say 25 different sub forums for different topics and you could create posts and comment and discuss with other people via the forums. For me this was where I spent most of my time alongside trading virtual items in game haha. Them getting rid of these forums is actually what lost me as an active user (thank god for me haha, I spent way too much time on there). Them removing the forums was a smart business move though, as they were the most toxic space on their platform and given they cater to young children it was smart to get rid of that toxicity.

> Roblox has components of a social network, a game, a marketplace, and a classroom. Its pretty astonishing, and I don't think I see Fortnite's developers making seminars to use Fortnite in the classroom. The metaverse, an idea I first heard in Snow Crash is what they're after. Imagine learning about the Coliseum in Rome by walking around it in your avatar that is the same one you used to shoot down goblins just earlier. And then using that same avatar to buy shoes in the official Jordan Roblox store, looking at a few ads on the way. Do you see where I'm going?

To me, it makes perfect sense to say ""hey, this company is going to make a lot more money in the future than it does now and I want to get in on that and sit until I make the profit I think it will return""

>(since your paying for the growth In today's price. 

To me, that's an investment. I pay an amount now, I am patient, I get more later. And Roblox is going to deliver, based on some of the research I mentioned. Or at least I think so.

EA is what it is, and I as a gamer might even say they're destined to begin to fail when their size and weight is not enough to hold them up. It was a good investment years ago, now I wouldn't touch it because there is no future path to growth for me. 

I'm not saying you're wrong, I just think we have different perspectives here. What do you think?",ZhukovsSwingingDick,1,/r/stocks/comments/m3oaur/do_your_reading_the_roblox_s1_dd/gqqbjyd/,0.035,0.825,0.14,0.962

How much money do they need to make to increase the value?  Where will they be in 10 years? If roblox takes 10 years to do 6 billion in a year,  are they still going to be worth 40 billion like EA?

884,DD," Finance like banks and asset/wealth management. 

Credit card companies and payment services are, in my opinion, almost tech these days. 

Industrials, chemicals, parts manufacturers, established pharmaceuticals, aerospace, consumer goods, food, REIT's. 

Plus everything in between. 

My portfolio currently is highly underweight in tech because I cannot find any that are, by my metrics, attractively priced. My portfolio is up and relatively impervious to the volatility of the past week or so.

That isn't to say tech isn't a good investment, it's simply that my understanding of how they're currently priced is lacking and my own rule is to not invest if I don't understand it. Thus, my current portfolio consists of (in no particular order):

One bank (non-US)

One asset managemet firm (US small cap)

One mining company (Non-US and small cap)

Kraft Heinz.

I'm not sure what the forum rules are on my picks since small cap and non-US companies can be small in terms of trading volume and can be easily manipulated, so I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post them.

There are some companies I'm eyeing at the moment but I simply can't justify buying them at their current price. I realize my diversification isn't great with only a handful of stocks, but I am looking at a few others at the moment. I consider myself a value investor and I think that there are opportunities out there even in the current market, which many would say is overpriced but which isn't an assessment I necessarily agree with. 

I'm sure there are some good tech picks out there as well, which is why I enjoy following everyone's DD here on Reddit as well.

Awesome.

>My rule is to buy the stock if the initial price drops to 10% 

Why the arbitrary threshold? Sure, take advantage of a dip, but it doesn't have to reach some certain amount. Besides, you should be putting in more money over time, because you like and trust these investments.

>  reconsider my DD if it drops 20% 

What was wrong with your DD in the first place? You either came away with the right conclusion the first time, or you didn't.

The only time I could ever reconsidering your position if the stock drops 20% is if it's because the CEO sucks, or the latest product flopped or whatever. If you're doing proper DD, you will actively be aware of such a situation. DD isn't a one-time thing -- it's ongoing.

>I haven't figured out what should I do if the stock rises more than 10%. Should I sell the 10% gained and keep my initial investment, should I sell it all and go away with the profit and wait for it to drop to a support line or should I keep holding to it? How do you do it?

If you absolutely must take profits, shave a bit off. But again, what is so special about the stock hitting a green 10%? If you're investing in the right companies, that should be *exactly* what you were planning to happen anyway.

Seriously, just hold. Pepper money in over time (maybe a bit more on big drops), and then hold. Focus all of this effort and concern you have on active DD instead. Read investor relations documents. Listen to earnings reports.

They are also designing and engineering EVs for the future while being truly on point for both businesses and consumers.  Taking risks to really give both more options and better options.

That is far from the usual way it goes. I got really lucky. I could have been wrong on any of those calls and it would have cost me potential gain. I've done it before And been wrong on those calls.

996,APPS," There are so many factors that affect that decision.  Do you need the cash at any point in time?  What are the growth prospects for that particular company?  Has anything changed with the company?  

Assuming this is a stock you plan to hold for a long time, you're always better off just holding and adding on dips.  That is unless it has become too large a portion of your portfolio.  Timing is just too difficult.  I'll share a personal story as an example.

During the summer of 2019 I was doing a search for small cap growth stocks and I came across a little company with amazing revenue growth. Goes by the ticker APPS.  I bought some that summer at around $5.  It went nowhere for a while, then started climbing, then got crushed by COVID.  And then it got caught up in the post-COVID high growth stock frenzy and ran up like crazy.

It got up to $24 very quickly and I was worried that it had run too far too fast and was destined for a pullback.  So I decided to sell, with the plan to buy back in regardless.  It didn't  drop so I bought back in at $25 - a bit annoying but not a big deal.  Then it ran up to about $34 and I feared it had gotten way overpriced.  So I sold again, with the plan to buy back in on a dip.

Guess what?  It dipped but rebounded strongly and I missed my entry point.  I never got back in.  Now the stock is at $80.",SirGasleak,1,/r/stocks/comments/m3kbig/averaging_down_vs_selling_and_rebuying_a/gqpqml4/,0.067,0.851,0.082,-0.2697

1004,AMC," short Buffett advice 1: don't waste time looking for the next amazon or tesla, tesla and amazon succeeding as we speak. 

short Buffett advice 2: stick to the boring things, if it's steadily making growing more than 9% a year, that's good enough


long advice:

i'll start off by saying you've started learning at the weirdest time (it's not your fault), and practically anything that's happened in the last 12 months is not normal and shouldn't be used as a reference. I've made incredible returns by investing during the pandemic dip, but I know it wasn't because i'm the next Buffett 

I started off sort of like you, albeit with much smaller sums of money. research is important, but I believe expereince and ""getting used to"" the whole stock market thing is possibly even more important. I'm talking 2-3 years at least. 

it's fun to find advice on potential big growth investments, read up on it, and buy it. I still do it too. but what I've learned from my experience is ""do I really, truely understand and believe this company is going to grow?"" 
I can't do any of the fancy analysis MBA guys do, so I try to stay away from unfamiliar fields and stick to familiar names. if i do invest in unfamiliar territories, it's really small amounts (like 1% of my portfolio) just to help me keep an eye on it. 
Most of my portfolio is ""mainstream stocks"" with that I understand has potential for steady growth, like Disney and Google. I also have Crocs stock, which I will admit I have no idea why it keeps on growing, but it must have a very solid business model. 


as for your current portfolio, ask yourself if you really understand the inner workings of those industries.  don't just trust what others say, can you visualize for yourself how it'll grow in the future? personally, I don't have a clue about gold or AMC or that chinese pharma, and can't imagine how it'll do in the coming years.

Investing is about risk management and facts. 

BB is currently valued at 6.29 billion, with an income of -830m (trailing twelve months). To put that in perspective, if you spent 6.3 billion dollars to buy all public shares of BB, you could then expect to lose an additional 830 million over the next 12 months. Now this is a flawed example because it is known that BB is turning around their business in a very attractive way, but it may take some time for that to catch up to make the business positive income. 

Now I do want to say that I do own a little bit of BB, but it's money that I can afford to let sit for a little while, and it's around half a percent of my active portfolio. I like the possibility of BB turning around the company and becoming a huge tech company once again.

1015,JPM," The best early piece of information I gained was to think about buying a company in terms of using your own money to purchase the entire company.

It's easy to see a numbers on a screen and say ""it went up before, so I think it will again"".

It's hard to say ""no, I would not spend 600, 700 billion of my own money to purchase Tesla, because the company doesn't make enough money for me to justify that purchase"" when you see how well it has returned for shareholders in the last year. 

Investing is about risk management and facts. 

BB is currently valued at 6.29 billion, with an income of -830m (trailing twelve months). To put that in perspective, if you spent 6.3 billion dollars to buy all public shares of BB, you could then expect to lose an additional 830 million over the next 12 months. Now this is a flawed example because it is known that BB is turning around their business in a very attractive way, but it may take some time for that to catch up to make the business positive income. 

Now I do want to say that I do own a little bit of BB, but it's money that I can afford to let sit for a little while, and it's around half a percent of my active portfolio. I like the possibility of BB turning around the company and becoming a huge tech company once again.

I'd say that from my perspective it seems like you are at a point where you need to start laying the foundation for a solid portfolio. I'd recommend things like MSFT, AAPL, JPM, EBAY. I try to pay attention to P/E ratios and to buy when I think a company is at a good value. All of these companies make a TON of money, and I'd be impressed if any one of them failed within the next ten years. 

I'd caution you to reevaluate ""get rich quick"" buys, as they will statistically not work out well for you. Better to take 20% every year and turn that in to a compounding machine than to take 100% one month and lose it all over the next year. 

You won't turn your $500 back in to $2,000 in a few days, but you could retire in the future using this method. Try out the math for making a 20 or 30% annual return over 10 years. Start with something like 10k and watch what happens. And that's not even including what you could add to it over that time as well.

I diversified into pharmaceuticals, banks, etfs, tech, and Tesla. 

If you think you’re holding too many companies then you’re probably holding too many companies. It’s better to pick a few reliable winners than betting on a bunch of companies. Don’t spread your money so far that you only have a couple shares of each company (not really worth it).

1031,BP," Am in a similar boat to you. 

I may be actively watching every day this week, but normally I do prefer a portfolio that can be left unwatched for a while if normal life gets busy. For me that translates to a diversified basket of relatively safe stocks and a property ETF that shouldn't unexpectedly take a nose-dive, and a small number of more speculative growth picks. 

Spreading out the set-and-forget seems safer; it's effectively one or more stocks in the main sectors - for consumer stocks it's a handful that I think are healthy but by nature none has a massive moat. 

Similarly for oil & energy -I'm out of pure renewables now, in favour of BP and Shell. I like both of them for now, but they're a bit too sensitive individually to news.

Yeah, this does have the diversity drag that people here complain about. But a common sentiment here is ""don't invest it if you aren't prepared to lose it"" which is quite frankly not the case for me. That's stuff for my retirement and a part of my mother's savings that she doesn't want the mental effort of investing herself. The speculative stuff is my educated gambling pot. 

Diversification is also good in case an unexpected big purchase comes up, there should be a selection there that I'm happy to sell for their current price instead of having to think hard. It's not expected, but if she has a big car accident? There's enough buffer but selling a portion quickly to replenish the buffer would be very preferable. Can rebalance on my own time after. Who knows, might need to hire an at-home carer or find a place to rent for a year in a managed living space.

Tbh I'd have more in ETFs, but where I am the selection in the currencies I want doesn't have great liquidity and funds generally charge a percentage for the initial investment of a lump sum. So I way have more individual stocks instead, for a selection I believe should perform well long-term and hopefully outperform their sector ETF. Will be slowly upping the portion in total market ETFs and funds.

IMO Holding many positions is fine so long as most of them aren't being actively traded. It's not hard to keep an overview of the mid-long term basket even if it does have a lot of eggs, all nicely colour-coded and commented in my overview.",Qpylon,1,/r/stocks/comments/m3dfnj/how_many_stocks_should_you_limit_yourself_to/gqobum6/,0.051,0.798,0.151,0.9925

People say this a lot: *Don't invest more than you're willing to completely lose.*

AFAIK, it's not possible to invest in the material itself like you can with oil or gold.  

When looking to invest in any new metamaterials, or any new tech in general, there are 5 super important obstacles to overcome before they can be considered a viable investment.  Those obstacles are in how it is produced: process, volume, speed, quality, cost.  

Process - do we have existing manufacturing facilities or machines we can adapt to make this new thing?  If so, FANTASTIC!  Metamaterials and bleeding-edge scientific tech in general really, really struggle with this.  We find lots of cool new stuff every day, but the biggest idea killer is ""we have to build all new factories to make it.""  That turns a lot of research off instantly unless the math behind the advantages is super compelling.  Luckily, we have some processes and stages that can be used to make graphene, but we're still struggling with a lot of the other pieces of the puzzle.

Volume - how much can be made in one go.  With graphene, is it only 100 square micrometers, or it 100 square miles?  Miles is preferred.

Speed - how quickly can they make that 100 square miles?  It's great if they can produce 100 square miles of it, but only if it doesn't take 12 years to do it.

Quality - how much of what is produced can actually be used?  For graphene, lots of applications require very high quality, high purity graphene, which is north of 99.0%.  This is true of a lot of metamaterials.  If they can make 100 square miles of it in a week, that's great, but not great if only 5% meets purity requirements for applications.

Cost - how much did it cost *the manufacturer* to make it?  This isn't the sale price after it's made, but what the factory has to pay to make that 100 square miles of graphene.  The higher the manufacturing cost, the more expensive the product, the harder it will be to attract buyers.

Apply these things to whatever you're researching for investment.  It's going to be a lot to learn, but do it over time, and it will pay off.  Literally.  If you're looking to use this knowledge for investment, it will literally pay off.  For example, I started about 7 years ago reading research papers in things that were just plain interesting (phys.org).  Since then, I gathered enough knowledge to know what to look for in LIDAR tech development to be able to turn 45% in a single IPO trade last year in a LIDAR tech startup.  To be fair, it also took advantage of the market hype around EVs, hype around IPOs, and general market insanity.  I also did *not* know it would turn 45% in a week, but I was confident that it would grow over 12 months, so when that 45% came in, I bailed.

I do not expect that to ever happen again, honestly, but it's been making me wonder if a career can be made in sniping tech IPOs.  It appears that if you can wrap your head around the tech enough to develop some confidence in even medium-term gains, you could jump into the IPO in case there's a typical IPO spike.  Point and counterpoint: LAZR was the LIDAR tech IPO that performed well for me, and it appears that very-hyped RBLX and CPNG stocks did not do well at all.  I was considering RBLX, but after looking at the company, I didn't see long-term return, so I didn't want to gamble on the IPO spike.  The market had even higher hopes for CPNG and that did even worse.  Buyer beware.

That would be my last bit of advice. I only put money in because I figured it would grow over *at least* 12 months.  Other people trade in shorter time frames and that also makes good money.  Personally, I don't have the energy or stress tolerance (thanks for showing me that, GME).

Volume - how much can be made in one go.  With graphene, is it only 100 square micrometers, or it 100 square miles?  Miles is preferred.

Speed - how quickly can they make that 100 square miles?  It's great if they can produce 100 square miles of it, but only if it doesn't take 12 years to do it.

Quality - how much of what is produced can actually be used?  For graphene, lots of applications require very high quality, high purity graphene, which is north of 99.0%.  This is true of a lot of metamaterials.  If they can make 100 square miles of it in a week, that's great, but not great if only 5% meets purity requirements for applications.

Cost - how much did it cost *the manufacturer* to make it?  This isn't the sale price after it's made, but what the factory has to pay to make that 100 square miles of graphene.  The higher the manufacturing cost, the more expensive the product, the harder it will be to attract buyers.

Apply these things to whatever you're researching for investment.  It's going to be a lot to learn, but do it over time, and it will pay off.  Literally.  If you're looking to use this knowledge for investment, it will literally pay off.  For example, I started about 7 years ago reading research papers in things that were just plain interesting (phys.org).  Since then, I gathered enough knowledge to know what to look for in LIDAR tech development to be able to turn 45% in a single IPO trade last year in a LIDAR tech startup.  To be fair, it also took advantage of the market hype around EVs, hype around IPOs, and general market insanity.  I also did *not* know it would turn 45% in a week, but I was confident that it would grow over 12 months, so when that 45% came in, I bailed.

I do not expect that to ever happen again, honestly, but it's been making me wonder if a career can be made in sniping tech IPOs.  It appears that if you can wrap your head around the tech enough to develop some confidence in even medium-term gains, you could jump into the IPO in case there's a typical IPO spike.  Point and counterpoint: LAZR was the LIDAR tech IPO that performed well for me, and it appears that very-hyped RBLX and CPNG stocks did not do well at all.  I was considering RBLX, but after looking at the company, I didn't see long-term return, so I didn't want to gamble on the IPO spike.  The market had even higher hopes for CPNG and that did even worse.  Buyer beware.

That would be my last bit of advice. I only put money in because I figured it would grow over *at least* 12 months.  Other people trade in shorter time frames and that also makes good money.  Personally, I don't have the energy or stress tolerance (thanks for showing me that, GME).

1042,RBLX," Hey man.  You're looking at some interesting things and asking really good questions.  People may laugh, but brush that aside and just focus on any facts people present.

People say this a lot: *Don't invest more than you're willing to completely lose.*

AFAIK, it's not possible to invest in the material itself like you can with oil or gold.  

When looking to invest in any new metamaterials, or any new tech in general, there are 5 super important obstacles to overcome before they can be considered a viable investment.  Those obstacles are in how it is produced: process, volume, speed, quality, cost.  

Process - do we have existing manufacturing facilities or machines we can adapt to make this new thing?  If so, FANTASTIC!  Metamaterials and bleeding-edge scientific tech in general really, really struggle with this.  We find lots of cool new stuff every day, but the biggest idea killer is ""we have to build all new factories to make it.""  That turns a lot of research off instantly unless the math behind the advantages is super compelling.  Luckily, we have some processes and stages that can be used to make graphene, but we're still struggling with a lot of the other pieces of the puzzle.

Volume - how much can be made in one go.  With graphene, is it only 100 square micrometers, or it 100 square miles?  Miles is preferred.

Speed - how quickly can they make that 100 square miles?  It's great if they can produce 100 square miles of it, but only if it doesn't take 12 years to do it.

>I  can assure you however, that at this price I am confident RBLX is a  great long term hold and if the price were to drop my only reaction  would be to grab more shares. This company has unlimited potential where  traditional games developers seem to be lagging. 

Why is it a great long term hold? They have an insane valuation. How will they be able to fullfil that valuation? What is the ""unlimited"" potential? How will they hold their customers that will outgrow the game, how will they not become the next ""Runescape"". Everyone played Runescape when I was in school, but after some time everyone stopped.

1075,GM," Tesla is comparable to other car companies. Yeah they are a bit different, but they are competing in personal transportation needs and they want the consumer to spend their money with them instead of Ford or GM or Kia.

You can call roblox whatever you want, but they are competing for the same thing that other video games are competing for.",soulstonedomg,2,/r/stocks/comments/m3m1cy/stop_comparing_roblox_to_game_developers/gqpsvtq/,0.087,0.845,0.068,-0.6486
1076,EA, 100% this. A regular game developer like EA has to spend hundreds of millions to develop a new title. Roblox just created a platform with development tools where other people spend the money/time to build the games. Roblox is more like unity than EA.,Own-Revenue9302,1,/r/stocks/comments/m3m1cy/stop_comparing_roblox_to_game_developers/gqpow8b/,0.0,0.844,0.156,0.7184
1077,NOK," I only chose NOK cause I bought in RIGHT after the Jan P&D.  It was cheap and still had a lot of press out there that it was ""going to the moon"" with the rest of those stocks so options were hot.  I'm not an options guy but wanted to play & learn.  I've bought a few Calls & Puts this year, some hit & some failed.  All my value-investing holdings had NO interest on the options chain so I needed to start somewhere.  The actual movement on the stock for the past 2 months has been minimal, so I believe I have a very small chance of getting exercised soon.  The height of the Jan spike was $6.50 so I'm leaving $150 on the table if I do get exercised soon...seems a reasonable cost of the education.
