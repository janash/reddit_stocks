180,DDF," So mixed news and results for the day; while we ended above my previous low estimate of $130, we did not close much higher than that (I recorded $132.37 at 4PM on the dot). With that said, I will update this again tomorrow morning based off the values after hours.

So below is an expansion of my previously posted theory that we are following the same trend. Note DFF is differential difference factor. The Difference factor is the a comparison of the value from the current run divided by the value from the January run. The DDF is a comparison of the day to day change for the current run divided by the day to day change for the January run.

Closing Values From the January Run Up Compared to March Run Up

1/11/21 / 19.94 || 2/22/21 / 46.00 || Difference Factor 2.31 

1/12/21 / 19.95 || 2/23/21 / 44.97 || Difference Factor 2.25 [Day2Day Change -0.01||-1.03; DDF 10300]

1/13/21 / 31.40 || 2/24/21 / 91.71 || Difference Factor 2.92 [Day2Day Change 11.45||46.74; DDF 4.08 ]

1/14/21 / 39.91 || 2/25/21 / 108.73 || Difference Factor 2.72 [Day2Day Change 8.51||17.02; DDF 2]

1/15/21 / 35.50 || 2/26/21 / 101.74 || Difference Factor 2.87 [Day2Day Change -4.41||-6.99; DDF 1.59]

1/19/21 / 39.36 || 3/1/21 / 120.41 || Difference Factor 3.07 [Day2Day Change 3.86||18.67; DFF 4.84]

1/20/21 / 39.12 || 3/2/21 / 118.00 || Difference Factor 3.02 [Day2Day Change -0.24||-2.41; DFF 10.04]

1/21/21 / 43.03 || 3/3/21 / 124.18 || Difference Factor 2.89 [Day2Day Change 3.91||6.18; DFF 1.58]

1/22/21 / 65.01 || 3/4/21  / 132.37 || Difference Factor 1.59 [Day2Day Change 21.98||8.19; DFF 0.37](<- we are here)

1/25/21 / 76.79 || 3/5/21

1/26/21 / 147.98 || 3/8/21

1/27/21 / 347.51 || 3/9/21

The average difference factor is 2.63, the maximum is 3.07, and the minimum is 1.59. The standard deviation is 0.49.

The reason I say we are following the January pattern is because of two factors; 1) the difference factor is generally around the average difference factor 2) the day to day changes generally follow the same ""pattern"" as January (on days that had negative change in January, there was negative change now, and this is true for increases and stagnant days).

Previously I assumed a 10% margin of error because I was mostly doing back of envelope calculations only looking at key points. From here on out I will consider the margin of error equal to the standard deviation divided by the average difference factor, which is currently 18.51%. Unfortunately it seems that we are beginning to see a breakdown of my hypothesis, so the error is getting higher. Based off these values here are my estimates for the next few trading days.

3/5/21 / $201.96 +/-$37.38

3/8/21 / $289.19 +/-$53.53

3/9/21 / $913.95 +/-$169.17

**PEAK VALUE**  Previous run / $483.00 || This run / $1270.29 +/-$235.13

The peak value should occure between opening bell March 8th and closing bell March 10th, based off what happened on the January run.

I will be updating this as the next few days progress. The current outlook is that the hypothesis is breaking down, and my calculations have to account for that with a larger margin of error. Chances are that by Monday my model won't track the current trajectory at all. That being said, keep my calculations in mind and watch the stock!",Prohamen,183,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxkint/gme_megathread_for_march_04_2021/gpp705h/,0.041,0.917,0.042,-0.3164

>Hello apes, I'm a former reporter at Bloomberg. I cannot divulge my name, but ask me anything else and I will try to prove I'm not bullshitting.

>Anyway, today we saw Bloomberg, CNBC, and Reuters simultaneously blast glowing articles about how Plotkin made 20% in Feb. Every story came out at the same time and cited ""sources"" or ""people familiar with the matter,"" but barely had any other details. This is typical of story planted by PR.

>PRs will tell every reporter on the street ""hey I got a tip for you but don't publish until Wednesday after market."" And every reporter thinks they have an exclusive and types up the article. And then PR gets the most bang for the buck as every outlet publishes the same bullshit at the same time.

>I would know. I deal with Melvin's cunty COO David Kurd when I was reporting on them. This is his usual tactic.
Anyway, I don't know if they're lying about these gains. Probably not. Maybe they fudged some mark-to-market valuations to show a good month.

248,GME," oversimplified ELI5 explanation

Hedge funds thought the stock would go down. They BORROWED shares, and sold them at say $10. Now the price is going up, and they need to buy at much higher prices, say $100, incurring a $90 loss (-900% return), in order to return the shares to where they borrowed them from. They are using all the influence they have to make this stock go down, but apes are still holding, thanks to this subreddit. HFs pay rent every day for the shares they borrowed (which is very expensive for several reasons), so at a certain point they will have to decide to cut their losses, buy shares in order to return them (‚Äòcover their short‚Äô). Buying the shares will increase the share price, which will force other shorters to do the same, driving the price to insane heights, rather fast. This is what you call a short squeeze. It is very likely to occur since there are A LOT of short sellers, I‚Äôve heard speculations between 30% and much higher than 140%; any of these numbers has the potential to turn this into the greatest short squeeze in history, a NYSE supernova if you will.

This is not financial advice, but it may be worth buying whatever small amount of GME shares you can afford to lose, and enjoy the ride/show. It‚Äôs important for the amount you invest to be affordable, so that you can confidently resist all types of legal and illegal attacks and tricks from HFs and media.

GME's price is likely going to drop to < $40 when the short is over. We've been boosting the company with our holding, but when we pull out, they're left unsupported.

If we all put 5% of our earnings back into GME, after the short, knowing full well it's likely not to turn a profit for months, if not years, we'd be giving back to the company who sparked this in the first place.

If you're anything like me, I've spent A LOT of hours in my local Gamestops. I even worked at one for a year. It's not a company without flaws, but I want to give back. I just think we should all consider putting something into GME after this is all over.

292,KEY," **SUMMARY OF GME SHORT INCLUDING KEY DATES AND RESOURCES**

If you're here for the short...

FINRA, a US government backed non-for-profit, reports SI% on stocks on a regular cadence. The numbers are calculated and provided to investment agencies/firms, which are cascaded to the public. It's my understanding that the raw data is provided, so some agencies provide different SI%.

FINRA SI Reporting Schedule

[https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest)

Next time numbers get to the public is 3/9. That means we'll find out if the short is still on (more than likely is - in fact, there are still firms shorting the stock even now, betting that we won't continue to hold long enough for them to get executed).

You find out about if the short is still on by visiting multiple credible sites, and making your own judgement about what the SI% is based on the firms findings.

[https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)

There are others. If someone posts them in the comments I'll add them to this next time I post.

Right now, based on the average of these 2 sites, we have about a 40-50% Short %. This is how we will end commanding the price, as long as we hold. When they come to collect these shares, and they must be collected, they will have to buy the shares from us, at whatever price we've set.

Now they could short their short, in order to buy themselves more time. But that also gives US more time to accumulate real shares. So again, a few weeks later when the calls come up, they must again either pay us, or short their short, that they'd already shorted. This would be reflected in the SI% going above 100%.

If the SI% has increased when posted on 3/9, the short is more than on - it's growing, hold. If it's the same, hold. If it's < 20% **on every site**, things get real questionable imo.

SI% gets updated every 2 weeks. Those are the big landmarks. And each Friday, calls are executed, which is when shorts may start collecting shares, in order to payout. I believe they have until Tuesday to fully pay out all executed shares.

At the moment, the price has been very stable, which is excellent. And today isn't likely to be a big key event date, it's likely that shorters aren't buying yet, waiting longer before they MUST collect. So a flat day like today is totally normal. Tomorrow will likely be similar. We may even see a dip. Anything below < $120 is a discount imo (considering that has been our floor for 3 days now). At 45% SI, all seriousness, I believe $500+ is not a meme. And it could certainly go WAY higher, if we all held together.

This is basically how it works, I think. There are people way smarter than me here, and I wouldn't be surprised if I was off on a few things. I'm not an advisor; this isn't financial advice. Just a dumb ape who wrote this up as a comment to someone who asked how this works and wanted to share. Let's build on this post together and keep it circulating. I also like the stock.

Films that put our most cherished filmmakers on the map in the 90‚Äôs could not and would not be made today. Who would risk it? Who would risk contending with social authoritarians cancelling your film? Take caution, because the current social climate is the death of art and artists. There will be no Pulp Fiction. Instead, our theaters will screen homogenized, pre approved safe films that nobody wants to pay for. Under this direction, all culture will suffer.

404,GME," As farfetched as it sounds I do think something like this is the way. Even without considering partnerships, GME already has the retail presence throughout the country that can house a whole ground-up grassroots Esports culture. Sure things like Twitch have connected the dots in the digital landscape, but this thing still needs to be brought into the physical world. A rare phenomenon where years of technological advance is creating a new demand in the physical world. There are young gamers/talent ready, there are viewers ready, there are sponsors ready. Esports as an industry has yet to be fully monetized.
Sure there may be some small scattered shops around the map, but it hasn‚Äôt been brought to scale. For GME, slowly clear your floor space by moving product sales online, and repurpose the physical space to house a new industry that is waiting to be born.
Esports‚Äô field of play may be in cyberspace, but the grooming of talent, negotiating of deals, and full realization of its potential needs a physical arena.

Declaring Bankruptcy is a great tool to stick it to the man. I am convinced that the stigma around bankruptcy is pushed by big players so that you will pour blood sweat and tears into their pockets for your whole life trying to dig yourself out of a money pit.

Fuck that. Declare bankruptcy. boom. All sorted. In the UK, no more chasing, no more letters, no more red bills. They will take your shit, but not all your shit. They have to leave you basics like a roof over your head (they might put a charge on your property equity), they even have to leave you your car if its cheap enough!

Live frugally for 6 years and pay back what you can. The courts calculate this, they calculate how much you need to live reasonably, then share the rest. then boom. You have passed go, collect your metaphorical ¬£200 and start afresh. Anything you did not pay back is written off. 

Yes there may be some restrictions in the types of jobs you'll be able to have but that's it. 

GOLDEN RULE (UK): if it's going to take longer than 6 years to pay off and you don't care about restrictions on job, then declare bankruptcy.

If you are serious about this I would suggest you get your CCNA which is a commonly know Cisco certificate.

If you Google CCNA braindump you will find hundreds of example questions and you can basically memorize the answers and cheat. This may sound immoral but in reality the test is bullshit and basically just gives you enough credibility to get in the door and start learning. 

As for people not giving you the time to adjust fuck them, there are probably 100k jobs in the field today and employees have a lot of power at the moment, get a job, learn what you can and if you get fired you will have learned a lot that will apply to the next job which you could have a week later lol.

That money is zero sum and comes from somewhere, the origin is your pocket, and the destination is their pocket. Your hesitancy here is wisdom. Most of you getting into this game are going to lose 80% of what you brought. If you're okay with that, then by all means, plinko your coins and pull the one arm bandit.

778,AMC," Disney could sell their movies exclusively on the bottom of the ocean and still make millions, what they do isn't reflective of the 42b film industry as a whole. Cinemas may die eventually sure, but not any time soon. Streaming services are a way off being profitable. Even Netflix, who's income increases year on year, is still losing money. 

Why do you think that most hollywood movies have been delayed until cinemas reopen? Were it more profitable, these movies would have sold to Amazon, Netflix etc and called it a day, but only a minority of films over the last year or so have gone streaming-only. Most are still delayed till 2021/2022 for a reason. 

At the very least, AMC, CINE.L, and many of the other cinema chains will reach pre-pandemic levels.

873,PLTR," I'd have to say I agree. Lock-up was and is the reason for the drop in price. There has been a cascade effect on sentiment; large investors and small both concerned the bottom will drop back out which is why we keep hitting resistance. However, I believe forward momentum is inevitable. Once the ball gets rolling (particularly past $30) I think $45-$50 is a realistic EOY goal. An optimistic outlook would put it closer to $60.

I bought in at $24.76, PLTR is now 15% of my portfolio (I think entry price and portfolio share are better gauges than shares/position value as this can be relative to the investor and their buying power.

Waiting usually leads to missing good entry points. I wouldn't hold off because if the stock rises you will soon be thinking ""oh I will wait for it to drop to where it was last week now because it looks like I was wrong"". Then it goes higher, then you say the same etc.

Yes, the programming can get more complex, but even a car is merely a set of many basic parts.  A car only functions as whole based on the design allowances of all those parts.  AIs can't do anything beyond this.  Even if an AI was given boundless flexibility, it's generally random chaos that goes nowhere.  You still have to tell it what has value, what's good, what the reward is, and how valuable it is.  And even then, it only acts based on those parameters and no more.

947,AI," the analogy comparing a toaster to a fighter jet is just wrong in that context. 

to use the toaster analogy, you would have to stay in the construct of ""cooking"" so to speak.   
with self improving  and self teaching / learning AI (which already exists) you start with something that doesn¬¥tr even know what a toast is, but giving all ingredients and tools.   
and rather sooner than later you end up with a 5 star michelin chef AI without ever  teaching the AI all the intricacies of cooking. it will teach itself and learn it all, just because it understood and built upon the basic principles. it all does this  on scale of speed impossible to match for any human. 

(sidenote: I doubt cooking will ever be the area AI will be pretty good at, but the example brings the point across). 

AI already can learn writing, reading, image recognition etc.

&#x200B;

only because the current publicly available version of google translator is bad, does not mean AI is not worth the effort. a coouple of years ago, MSFT had a key note presentation where AI was able to translate chinese into english. in real time. speech to speech. 

also:  
using the evolution of human society and the time that was needed to  achieve this evolution and actually comparing this to improvement speeds of AI is ... ""problematic"" as speeds of development is ever increasing, no matter the topic. 

 it took but only a couple of years (relatively) to go from the first concept of flight to planes much that can reach the upper amtosphere. 

the very first programmable computer was built in 1941. now we have supercomputers with 415.5 petaflops. thats less than 100 years.   
and humans had to solve countless limitations during this time. yet development speeds keep improving. 

MuZero, a learning algorithm based on AlphZero, played / learned games without ever being taught the rules. 

Alphazero ""learned"" chess by playing it against itself for 24  hours. 

AlphaGo learned Go (a much more complex problem mathermatically than Chess)  in 3 hours.

only because the current publicly available version of google translator is bad, does not mean AI is not worth the effort. a coouple of years ago, MSFT had a key note presentation where AI was able to translate chinese into english. in real time. speech to speech. 

also:  
using the evolution of human society and the time that was needed to  achieve this evolution and actually comparing this to improvement speeds of AI is ... ""problematic"" as speeds of development is ever increasing, no matter the topic. 

 it took but only a couple of years (relatively) to go from the first concept of flight to planes much that can reach the upper amtosphere. 

the very first programmable computer was built in 1941. now we have supercomputers with 415.5 petaflops. thats less than 100 years.   
and humans had to solve countless limitations during this time. yet development speeds keep improving. 

MuZero, a learning algorithm based on AlphZero, played / learned games without ever being taught the rules. 

Alphazero ""learned"" chess by playing it against itself for 24  hours. 

AlphaGo learned Go (a much more complex problem mathermatically than Chess)  in 3 hours.  

&#x200B;

basically its evolution on speed.

For now, however, we just caught some assholes with their pants around their ankles and GME to $200, $400, $800, $1,600 are the prices they're gonna have to pay to get themselves out of this.

**But it's a risk I'm more than willing to take.**

**Because I'm posting this to show that I'm not afraid.**

My life on this Earth is temporary and short. And while life is pretty good right now, I'm not exactly where I want to be and can't shake the feeling that it can be so much better.

So why should I keep living in the shadow of my own fear while I allow my soul to slowly die?

That's why it truly doesn't matter how much this stock goes up or down. 

If this rockets, I'll be able to begin living the life I truly want to live and be able to accomplish so much more.

If it goes down into the ground, then guess what? So am I in 80 years or less.

And by that point, will it even matter?

It creates a tidal wave that feedback loops into itself and hedge funds can maintain that wave to fleece all of you of your money by getting you to do exactly the wrong thing. It's beautiful symphony of mathematics and strong AI that this works at all. The fact that the shoe-shine boy is absolutely glowing over his stock advice, and is filled with joy about Tesla now has my finger hovering over sell-all and wait for the retest of 180, eliminate the whole position. When the shoe-shine boy once again returns the countenance of his face to that of sunken eyes and beaten slave, then is the time to rebuild the position.

You are playing a zero sum game against very VERY strong AI. Remember that time you played chess against strong AI and got absolutly massacred? That's what this is. If you feel lured in. You're like a fish attracted to the piece of food on a hook. You will double your money, but the 10 transactions after you will lose 80% and be left with less than what you started.

Hedge funds don't have profits in the tens and hundreds of billions annually for no reason. That money is zero sum and comes from somewhere, the origin is your pocket, and the destination is their pocket. Your hesitancy here is wisdom.

That's why its sus to see rkt DD and same day massive gains then skt DD same day massive gains. These are short lived and correct after one day.

Even reporters coming out same day saying it's the new wsb. Just hours later. I'm thinking to myself I've been jerking off all day and looking at wsb and I didnt catch it. Wtf. How can a lazy reporter get an article out faster than I can catch it? Cause they are picking up the shill bots.

1600,AI," Citadel is in the dumb money acquisition phase. The 3-cup ball swindle has 3 pieces. 1: make the mark feel like a genius by letting him win and playing dumb. 2: Wait till they collectively surge and push in their nest eggs and replicate their exuberence, then 3: stop them out by retesting a panic sell 180. It creates a tidal wave that feedback loops into itself and hedge funds can maintain that wave to fleece all of you of your money by getting you to do exactly the wrong thing. It's beautiful symphony of mathematics and strong AI that this works at all. The fact that the shoe-shine boy is absolutely glowing over his stock advice, and is filled with joy about Tesla now has my finger hovering over sell-all and wait for the retest of 180, eliminate the whole position. When the shoe-shine boy once again returns the countenance of his face to that of sunken eyes and beaten slave, then is the time to rebuild the position.

You are playing a zero sum game against very VERY strong AI. Remember that time you played chess against strong AI and got absolutly massacred? That's what this is. If you feel lured in. You're like a fish attracted to the piece of food on a hook. You will double your money, but the 10 transactions after you will lose 80% and be left with less than what you started.

Hedge funds don't have profits in the tens and hundreds of billions annually for no reason. That money is zero sum and comes from somewhere, the origin is your pocket, and the destination is their pocket. Your hesitancy here is wisdom. Most of you getting into this game are going to lose 80% of what you brought. If you're okay with that, then by all means, plinko your coins and pull the one arm bandit.

The previously rich and wealthy squander all their resources to try  and maintain a semblance of their previous wealth and power, but too many millionaires have been created. They rise up, and the population soon realizes that as the bullshit top-down system no longer works at all. Everyone is quitting their jobs as the US dollar rapidly declines and the entire economy collapses.

The enemies of the US see this and go to war with you guys. Nuclear war. The world is decimated.

Enter Snowpiercer. The sole ark of salvation built by us, the apes, to save humanity as the world crumbled apart. The only way maintenance is done is by having a small person -- someone very small about the size of an oompa loompa -- go into the small shafts in the train.  Unfortunately, all of the oompa loompas have now died off, and we have to use children to keep the trains running.

Years pass. No one knows who really built these trains and why. We know. We inherited Wonka's wealth. We innovated and became inventors like him.

So when a few mods come out and say that, you'll get downvoted. I was gonna buy in but after looking into a lot of these accounts myself, and seeing the strange activity I bought puts.

Now, if the call expires worthless, you'll lose the premium only. If you sell the contract at a lower value, you'll lose the price difference (which can't be more than the premium).

1652,CEO," Copied from r/stocks. Link to the original comment below. Tons of dd on r/stocks and other subreddits on how uwmc is tremendously undervalued, especially now with RKT at $30.

I've responded a few times to these posts in the last week or so (maybe I responded to you before, sorry if I have) but uh, I agree. Its not gotten much love here on reddit, its hated in the SPAC subreddit and most threads about it have been pretty quiet here.

They have a market cap of 15 billion and as you noted have 7.5% of their market cap in straight cash! They have a forward P/E of 6.5 while RKT has a forward PE of 10. My brains a little tired and I didn't feel like doing the math to calculate their current P/E. Their share of the market sphere is picking up. For example, RKT is a consumer driven mortgage originator, RKT deals with people like you or I and attempts to fund and approve the loan. UWMC is a broker dealer, and deals primarily with the loan officers and lending companies directly. That share of the market sphere (broker dealers) peaked in 2008 and has subsequently fell and leveled off in 2014 at 14%. Its currently been rising for the last 7 years at a rate of 1-2% per year. Broker dealers like UWMC dealt with roughly 20% of the mortgage market in 2019 and will capture an estimated 21% in 2020 and return to the peak 33% by an estimated 2026. Their refinance volume obviously will shrink as it doubled with the low rates, but they should continue to capture more of the original home loans as broker dealers continue to regain market sphere, plus they are now looking to target jumbo loans adding more original loans to their books

Commenced plans to restart jumbo offerings which are expected to go  live in March 2021 and will also materially increase purchase volume  during the remainder of 2021.

They have an industry leading close time (twice as fast as rocket, 3x as fast as industry average) and have one of the highest NPS scores in the industry. They have insane margins and their cost to originate the loans are much lower than the retail sector (RKT) They also pay a good dividend, which as price keeps dropping increases. It was up to 4.6% last time I calculated it.

United Wholesale has invested heavily in technology. Findamortgagebroker.com, which aired a 2021 Super Bowl ad, was a massive investment. It intends to raise awareness of mortgage  brokers as a lending vehicle for homebuyers. Consumers will be able to  get referrals to a mortgage broker that will help the consumer decide  which product is best. Other technology investments include UTrack, a tracking application  that will tell the borrower, broker, and realtor the current status of a  loan. Blink+ is the company's loan origination system, which assembles  the documents and handles the nuts and bolts of putting together the  loan. Finally, EASE Docs handles the final documents for closing.¬†The payoff for that technology is not only faster times to close but  lower costs to originate. In the fourth quarter, United Wholesale took  18 days to manufacture a loan compared to 56 days for the typical retail  lender. On the conference call, CEO Tim Forrester said that United  Wholesale's cost to originate a loan (including the broker's  compensation) was $5,800 per loan compared to the average retail cost of $8,872. This translates into lower borrowing costs. United Wholesale's  average loan rate was 2.74% in the fourth quarter compared to 2.89% for  the overall industry.¬†¬†

They absolutely must have fantastic technology and workflow tools as they process loans that quickly but just go ask any of your friends or family whom are in the business what they think of them. One of my best friends is a loan officer who deals with UWMC directly multiple times a month, and he loves them, like, thrice as much as RKT whom he compares to a used car salesman (Tho RKT has good reviews online, not trying to trash them either, they're being beat down for whatever reason too)  and says the tech is so much cooler than anything else he uses. Their customers had an average credit score of 757 and a DTI of 36%. Not exactly clients I expect to be going defunct in a correction or pandemic.

Finally, United Wholesale introduced a  quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share, which gives the company a 4%  dividend yield. This is higher than most of its competitors aside from New Residential, an originator with a different business model. The Street sees United Wholesale earning $1.40 next year, giving the company a price-to-earnings ratio of 7.1 times. United Wholesale's cost advantage may allow it to take share from other lenders

Obvious cant analyze a stocks upside without downside too.

Downside - The massive amount of shares make every dollar a 1.5b increase in cap

Counter - Does that matter in this market? Well until UWMC I thought not, but it gives people a reason to be bearish and somewhat understandably so.

Downside - Refinances will go down in volume causing profit to shrink if/when rates up

Counter - but I disagree that this will cause massive downside for the company. Refinance should level off as they increase original loan volume elsewhere which is their main goal, and rates are not intended to go up anytime soon

Downside - Big banks space - People liken big banks to home loans (BOA/WFC etc)

Counter - They should also be taking more and more market sphere from big banks and others, not losing it no?  Who wants to go deal with wells Fargo tho? People hate those motherfuckers and for good reason lol.

Downside - Market crash / Housing crash

These really don't have a counter, wont be pretty for most companies should this happen and is not something that I really take into account when picking stocks in most sectors. I'm not countering the downsides to say they don't exist, I'm just interjecting why I think they're not a massive reason to be bearish, but maybe I'm blinded because I like the company and have been in it for awhile (and I made a good chunk of change before merger) - I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice and just the reasons I jumped into the stock, blah blah. Currently holding most my shares in my retirement account and recently added back in at 9.37 and 8.88 for another swing in webull. People online are saying this is heavily shorted, but highest I saw was 42% short interest (Someone said as high as 68% but I wasn't able to verify that) - Every time I type this up or paste this and modify it a little I get more bullish, double check their investor presentation and their recent SEC filings and... I want to buy more. At 8 dollars I just cant help myself, maybe I'll be broke soon, who knows.

But I absolutely HATE knowing there are so many people without access to the same quality of life. The door is closed for so many!! All I did was be born. This is NOT right. At the very least the ladder should be accessible for people to climb, but in reality the ladder no longer exists.

I HATE knowing there are people struggling to pay rent. I HATE knowing there are people with less than ten bucks to their name. I HATE knowing there are parents who, despite everything they've tried, cannot afford to put food on the table for their children.

1714,AI," Citadel is in the dumb money acquisition phase. The 3-cup ball swindle has 3 pieces. 1: make the mark feel like a genius by letting him win and playing dumb. 2: Wait till they collectively surge and push in their nest eggs and replicate their exuberence, then 3: stop them out by retesting a panic sell 180. It creates a tidal wave that feedback loops into itself and hedge funds can maintain that wave to fleece all of you of your money by getting you to do exactly the wrong thing. It's beautiful symphony of mathematics and strong AI that this works at all. The fact that the shoe-shine boy is absolutely glowing over his stock advice, and is filled with joy about Tesla now has my finger hovering over sell-all and wait for the retest of 180, eliminate the whole position. When the shoe-shine boy once again returns the countenance of his face to that of sunken eyes and beaten slave, then is the time to rebuild the position.

You are playing a zero sum game against very VERY strong AI. Remember that time you played chess against strong AI and got absolutly massacred? That's what this is. If you feel lured in. You're like a fish attracted to the piece of food on a hook. You will double your money, but the 10 transactions after you will lose 80% and be left with less than what you started.

Hedge funds don't have profits in the tens and hundreds of billions annually for no reason. That money is zero sum and comes from somewhere, the origin is your pocket, and the destination is their pocket. Your hesitancy here is wisdom. Most of you getting into this game are going to lose 80% of what you brought. If you're okay with that, then by all means, plinko your coins and pull the one arm bandit. The first hit is free, the high will be like your first attempt at heroin, you will be superman, it's the next 100 that will ruin you.",streetcleanermed,-2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxcfpi/gme_you_treated_me_like_a_princess_today_while/gpmxcya/,0.097,0.8,0.102,-0.2638

I think they should focus on expanding into the PC building, deliver on demand, collectables area and try and offer a more refined service than amazon - while also offering some downloadable content. Chewy has a $45M market cap in a $200BN industry. The gaming industry is predicted to reach $300BN by 2026, a similar trajectory would result in a market cap of 60BN for gamestop, i.e $1K a share. If i were a shortseller, i'd want to be well out of here before we find out.

Converting the stores into rentable gaming spaces for tournaments and team games could also be an interesting venture.

The only reason why Epic was able to take a chunk of their market ( last I heard they took about 25%, but that was months ago) was giving out free games. Even with free games they are no where near close to competing with Steam. 

GameStop already has an uphill battle with becoming an online presence.

1913,EA," Frankly if GameStop is going to go down this route then I‚Äôm team Melvin. I barely tolerate GoG. I pirate less games because of Steam‚Äôs features. SteamVR is so good that both the Epic Store and Microsoft store sells games that require you to install steam and make an account so you can download SteamVR and the games sold to you outside of the Steam platform can use it. Steam‚Äôs biggest competitor is the Epic Games Store that can only compete because it has Fortnite and Unreal Engine money. EA is like the biggest publisher in the US and Origin is no Epic games store because EA doesn‚Äôt bring in Fortnite money. Tencent is the only other company that could seriously compete with Steam if they wanted to, and they‚Äôre very obviously planning on it. Sure, it took a while to get refunds, and there‚Äôs no game reselling (which absolutely makes sense to me in a digital marketplace unless valve took a fuck huge cut on reselling transactions between users, like a way higher cut than 30%), but the Epic Games Store still doesn‚Äôt have a shopping cart, it still killed Linux support for tons of popular games, and it‚Äôs still trying to gain market share by just giving away free games. It‚Äôs like when Standard Oil (shoutout to Exxon) would build a new gas station in town, undercut everyone else until the only gas stations were S.O. gas stations, then hike up the prices higher than they had ever been before. It‚Äôs so transparent that this is what they‚Äôre doing with both Steam and Apple‚Äôs App Store that it‚Äôs frankly hilarious. What was I talking about?

1919,GME," I like the idea, but to punch holes in the thesis, GameStop cannot simply become ""another Steam competitor"", that would be a true death knell on the coffin. Even if they dropped their cut of game sales to 10%, the problem is Steam has a locked in userbase that isn't going to move platforms. Epic Games and Twitch are giving away games to users for their platforms and (I'm assuming) their userbases are still dwarfed compared to Steam. Likewise, users have entire libraries on Steam they aren't going to abandon, and jumping between platforms is more trouble than just working on one. Its like Mixer vs. Twitch or anything vs. Facebook - its just easier to stay on the more popular platform, regardless of the other's features.

But, theorycrafting to avoid work, I have one idea that could make GME a 'Steam killer' - `allow users to resell their games`.

First, its a cornerstone to their business, and a meme to the world. 

More importantly, it plays into a weakness of digital gaming platforms not currently addressed by the other companies. Anyone with a Steam account owns dozens of games they've never played or even downloaded. But those games are just licenses to the game and once your refund period is over, its just a dead license if you never touch it. I'd gladly sell my unused license of ""Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee"" for less than $2.99 (Steam's current price). Or even let users sell licenses to games they just no longer play, like my ""PAYDAY 2"" (currently at $9.99). Let the game developer and GME get a cut of the sale and boom, money. Assuming that it'd be difficult to exploit such a system (as the upperbound would be the platform's own price for the game), they could even offer bundle license sales where you get X copies of a game you can resell after the fact. However, I'd say they'd need an economist whose studied Warcraft Auction House goblins to truly secure it. Digging deeper into the rabbit hole, if they could get Steam/Epic/etc platforms on board to allow selling/trading of their platforms' licenses, I think then you could see a major adoption in users. The only issue there is a big one though, convincing the other companies to get on board.",tsumnia,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lx5yjb/gmes_future_steamkiller/gpm1wpf/,0.108,0.773,0.119,0.3695

1921,IP," The market is definitely not oversaturated. Right now with the current industry tools, it's becoming more and more possible for medium/smaller studios to release games and see explosive growth. Now let's consider there are only 4 places developers can realistically expect to release their games for a sizeable profit.

1. Publisher platforms ([Battle.net](https://Battle.net), Origin, Uplay, etc.) generally only contain games published by the platform owner. So if you aren't published by them, this isn't an option. If you want to be published, be ready to either sell your IP or give them a massive cut of your revenue. I am talking 40%+, and that's if they even want to publish you which most don't.
2. You could release on Epic, who are hungry for games right now, but dealing with them is a bit of a pain in the ass because they are still working out their process for publishing and distribution, marketing/advertising, and price points/sales. They have a ways to go, but they are definitely headed in the right direction.
3. Or you can go to Steam, where 90% of the industry launches on, because they are very well established and you can be sure that your game will not only be seen, but priced fairly with extremely refined launch and release support. The cost? A 30% cut of your revenue. And everyone pays this, non-negotiable (unless you are a big boy publisher and then negotiations absolutely happen).
4. Or you can go to GoG or other smaller platforms, which are definitely an option but since they aren't as widely known or accepted you run the risk of lower sales.

Considering the amount of releases on Steam vs Epic, I don't think Epic is competing effectively yet. They won't be for a couple of years, I don't think. They are going in the right direction, but they have a ways to go, especially when they have multiple things on the go that could sap resources from the expansion like their continued Engine development and work they have to continue to do as a Publisher for games like Fortnite.

Gamestop doesn't have that problem. They are 100% sales and distribution. 100% focused on that. Not publishing, not developing, not tech development or research, simply sales and distribution. Even Steam still has to continue publishing and development for games like CS:GO and DOTA2. Gamestop is free from the shackles of publishing and development, and can focus all of their attention on digital and physical sales and distribution, and that fucking excites me.",Souperdev,26,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lx5yjb/gmes_future_steamkiller/gple4hz/,0.041,0.832,0.127,0.9883

The competitors who are out there have largely only shot themselves in the foot by restricting themselves to their own platform and not distributing through Steam.

Nobody wants 20 different app stores the same way nobody wants 20 different streaming services. A bunch of people might be willing ""diversify"" their libraries across platforms, but it's not a small hurdle. I'm going to buy on Steam almost 100% even if some other platform has something, just because then I don't have to think ""which platform did I buy that on?"" when I want to play it. And I don't even really give af about all the digital bobbles that also rake in cash for them because many other people do give very many ~~fucks~~ bucks.

Pretty much nobody else even has anything like Valve's digital goods marketplace (chock full of assets that will never ever ""port""). Valve's market guy literally went to become finance minister in Greece.

Yeah sure, OP is totally right. IF someone fielded a viable competitor to Steam, they will make bank. Just go field a viable Amazon competitor, that will make bank too. Or Wal-Mart. Big tendies. The biggest.

I totally get those both involve tons of B&M, warehousing, logistics, and distribution that isn't even a factor in digital distribution. If you gave me a billion dollars on the condition I start a competitor to one of the three though? Well, there's zero way I'm picking Valve/Steam as my competition. It's not as though everyone just sat around the last 20 years watching them crush it without thinking, ""damn, how do WE do that?"" or even trying to. Ask Brad Wardell (Stardock) how awesome it would be to take Steam as his competition in a billion dollar blank check theoretical.

It gets 10x worse when you consider that all Valve really has to do if you become anything resembling a threat is to say, ""ok, from now on, if you want to distribute through us, we're your exclusive distribution channel"".

Thing is, they basically manufactured an entire digital goods market. Financially, it has to be a boon.

This stuff is solely traded on a market they created where they get fractional bits of every single trade. None of this exists in any competitor and even if it did, none of people's existing collections would port.

1994,GME," Thanks for sharing. I was too late for GME, but it got me into finally doing everything needed to join the trading. I wanted to do this seriously for years and years.

After a month, and some stupid mistakes, i hhad to close 2 positions because i lacked the experience to judge if it would drop further, and lacked the patience to just wait a week.
so stupidly i sold 2 differenct companies' stocks, 200 dollars total.
But i managed to get a daily profit of dollars to recently 30 dollars per day. Spending some hours per day.
And much room for improvement.

I really enjoy this.
1500 -200 in just a month.
Finally a way to earn some money (i am disabled), and its fun too. And its evdn more fun being able to read the stories and advice people share on reddit.

1997,GME," It‚Äôs mostly just luck to be honest with you. I figured the buying volume Thursday was shorts hedging their position for the following day. One of the hardest things to learn (and I still occasionally suffer from it) is being content with your gains, even if the price continues to rise. At $170 I was content on possibly missing future gains, and I believed that the gamma squeeze wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere near $300. In the original squeeze I sold 50 shares at $50, 50 at $200, 100 @ $280 and the last 100 at $250. You‚Äôre never going to be able to time the top perfectly. I could of made over $100k had I been able to, but instead my profit was ~60k during the first squeeze and I‚Äôm content with that. Yes, I bought 25 shares today (after selling RKT for 4K profit) just to have some skin in the game, but I‚Äôll probably buy another 25 pre-market.

2032,FVRR," I work for a large corporation. I invested in ZM and FVRR and made a killing last year. I believe heavily in work from home tech. I also know that both technologies are here to stay and will only go up. With that being said I sold both stocks as multi baggers last month.  

It doesn't matter about the fundamentals as much as it is about demand.  The big institutions aren't buying right now and the demand is low so the stocks are tanking despite the incredible earnings reports. Wall Street is rebalancing away from tech and they will pick apart any tech company that is successful on any nit picking reason they can. That's just how it works.  The same people that own the corporations own the media and they use it to cook the books in their favor. 

When the dust clears work from home tech is apart of corporate life forever now.  I use to go to 7 meetings a day.  5 or 6 hours a day in meetings of which about 15 minutes was related to my department.  It was a colossal waste of my time.  Now I attend those meetings from my office or home. 

 I continue doing my work and when it gets to my portion of the meeting I unmute and deliver my report. Then I promptly hit mute and continue working. 

 I get 3 time as much done know. It is 1000 times more efficient. Every one of my bosses and supervisor feel the same way.  I will never ever go back to a 20 minute walk from the production department to the managers office area again as long as I have a say in how my production department is ran.

If I need to leave early and there is a 4pm meeting I take it in the car on the drive home. Nobody minds cause they are in there cars as well. 

Have you ever purchased an office space in New York city for 300 people.  It's pretty fucking expensive. My company sent all managers home for 6 months.  They did their jobs from home on Zoom. Our factory never stopped making widgets and they discovered that they don't actually have to physically come to work more than 3 times a month if that.  

They could even go to their vacation homes in Colorado and work there. The wife and kids love it. The Bosses are happy cause they can actually work more hours with less commute time. When their day is done they are in the location they enjoy most on Mon through Sunday. They use to take a friday flight and only saw wife and kids on the weekends. (True Story).

The 2 million dollar month rent in New York for corporate office space is actually not really needed. You can hire the best of the best out in San Francisco to do the job and you no longer have to buy his house there and find him one in New York. (True Story). 

Life as we know it has changed forever because of Covid. Zoom will own the future but at the moment they are new and gonna take a beating but....... trust me...they will come back..let the dust settle....and the stock drop....then buy the dog shit fuck out of companies like zoom.

2126,DD," OP, I also want to thank you for this gem of a DD. I see two competing issues here that I‚Äôve yet to make heads or tails of:

1) As you point out, raising interest rates will precipitate a sea of red (I agree) and could tank the market. The fed‚Äôs inability to effectuate QT (despite increasing interest rates) and contract the money supply would definitely tank the market.

2) As I reflect on Macro 101, I recall that cash holders tend to lose out in inflationary economies as the purchasing power of the dollar diminishes. 

Seeking shelter in the bear cave while watching my mortgage diminish (in relative terms) sounds more and more appealing. I‚Äôm curious what you thoughts are towards a third factor: Targeted sector specific devaluations. If I put my tinfoil hat back on, I wouldn‚Äôt put it past our friends on Wall Street to try and manage the fall (controlled crashing?). There are plenty of opinions being circulated about tech bearing the brunt of the bond yield spike.

2156,EOD," Yes - it's nice. A descending parallel channel following a bullish spike (aka, what we saw happen on the first day of this recent spike) is a consolidation channel that typically follows with a breakout through it.

This is far, far from a perfect channel - it only touches twice. Which in many ways doesn't really make it a true channel, but I drew it on day one/two to see if it would follow.

The fact that it didn't even make it back down again - in my opinion - is an indication as to the degree/strength of breakout we might see here.

But again, this is far from perfect TA. It's not a verified channel due to minimal touches, but as you can see at EOD today in terms of volume spike - right after breaking through the channel - it seems like it's being treated as one.

It's also a great time to sell puts. For anyone else currently selling covered calls on it and wheeling it, please do not get greedy and continue setting your strikes lower to pick up a few more bucks. It's going to fly up and fuck you just like it did me when I had 900 shares called away on its first trip past 30 in Jan.

2372,GME," I follow Steve Van Metre pretty religiously and he's shown that past QE and papers from the FED have stated that deflation is the mostly likely path right now. If you have a chance, listen to lectures by Richard Koo, he was working with Japan during their market collapse in the 80's and he has amazing insight into expectations. Overall, the FED's goal is to drive bond interest rates to 0, which will cause stonks to fall. The Eurozone and Japan have been exporting deflation and our companies have not been able to pass on inflated prices of raw goods onto consumers lately, so this is hurting companies right now and consumer prices will fall soon (also deflationary). 

The only way we get inflation is if the banks open their doors and start lending to everyone right now (which they won't, given the current unemployment rates). So all this QE money will stay locked away within the banks and stonk market (unless the GME bubble super pops!) until further notice. This also causes a dollar shortage (see M2 velocity & remember companies not accepting dollars & banks not issuing dollars last year?), which will also lead to a dollar rally and will cause yields to drop (and the stonk market).

TLDR: Deflation is certain until banks ease lending restrictions. The FED has already stated what's going to happen, but people don't listen/understand what they're saying.",Camposaurus_Rex,16,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxtjky/raising_yield_bonds_gme_and_why_the_hedge_funds/gpp2q8c/,0.044,0.897,0.058,0.5217

2397,GME," I‚Äôm not an expert, but you are correct, buying puts above the current trading price is a bit strange.  I mean, it can work but would have to be a pretty specific situation to be worth anything. 

The point of a put (in a normal world) is to provide an exit point if price plunged.  Say you bought a $100 put on GME, and GME tanked to $50 (complete fantasy obviously), those puts (chance to sell at $100) would be valuable to someone.  Or if you owned the shares and exercised to exit your own positions.  

That‚Äôs what puts do, provide a floor to the losses above the actual bottom.  Here puts are generally sold before expiration to those looking to reduce their loses (pay to sell at less of a loss than at market price)

A call is the opposite, chance to buy in at a lower price than market.

Edit:  because GME is volatile (no other stock jumps 10-20% in a matter of minutes on a fairly regular basis) as fuck, the calculation behind the prices is all over the place resulting in price changes that are contrary to normal due to this.  So you can see a put increase in value briefly even as the stock increases",A_Rising_Wind,10,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxtyl1/decided_to_trade_options_for_the_first_time_today/gpp6jyk/,0.083,0.813,0.104,0.545

2539,GME," I also knew it was going to dip after the rally. Why? Because it already happened twice before from loud stocks spoken on WSB.

First of all, we know that stocks don't rally super high for no reason and if it's done especially by hype, then you KNOW it will fall. Day traders, momentum traders, swing traders all hop on for fast cash and leave early. That's exactly what happened with GME, then TLRY, then you know the next one - RKT. The same thing happened with GME during the 2nd run back up $180 high. I knew it was going to fall but luckily I had a call before the rally and sold at high, then bought a put and sold on low. The same thing goes for RKT. Had a call before the rally (bought when I've noticed it was gaining traction on WSB with people going ""all in"" before the push) and sold during the high rally up and bought a put immediately.

Just know that, whatever goes up (especially with hype) **will** come down. The only problem is, nobody will ever know how high it'll go. I'm not saying that it's my fault or WSB fault's for falling. It's mainly the HFT and swing traders that doesn't even use WSB that makes it fall easily cause they trade on a large amount of shares for quick cash.

WSB does have a chance, but a lot of people here are making the same mistake over and over again after GME showed everyone what's going to happen on a hyped movement so many people lost a lot of money on weed stocks like SNDL and TLRY simply on a delusional thought that ""they believe"". But we all knew SNDL was a shit stock and it only moved up cause of TLRY just like NOK did cause of GME. Eventually, they all fell back down after.
