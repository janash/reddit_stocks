4,SO," Added Note: In my thinking (and this is what I did), once you've made 3X your money, pull out 150% - 200% of what you invested.

I.e., You invested $1K.  Now it's $8K.

So, if you pull out $2K, you've literally doubled your money and still have $6K in there to play with.

So now, no matter what happens, it's impossible for you to lose, even if every company you are invested in disappears overnight and all of your stocks drop to $0.

You cannot do any worse than; ""I doubled my money.""‚Ä¶ and even in the worst case scenario, will be able to declare yourself a winner in the stock market! :-)

I gotta tell ya, when I did that, with being light on funds with bills coming in and on top of that knowing that when I invested that I was risking money that we could really use, I don't know what your situation is, but it took SO much stress and pressure off of me!!!

Now I can relax a lot more!  There is still some stress that comes inherent with it, of course.  But it's just nice to know that even if I do screw up, I haven't screwed us over.  We made money no matter what.

I'm not saying to then not care about what happens.  If anything, I work better at it, because the stress doesn't cloud my judgment and I can work smarter and apply the ""Don't Panic!"" rule a lot easier. :-)

However, it‚Äôs pieces don‚Äôt fit together. Vayu and Impossible Aerospace are doing essentially the same thing; they‚Äôre producing UAV and drone technologies and keeping them as separate entities seems to be the operate of synergistic.

Furthermore, I‚Äôm not convinced that VTOL is a significant selling point for Vayu‚Äôs drone since the majority of drones are rotary anyway, and thus capable of vertical takeoffs. Excel Fabrication, Quality Circuit, Assembly, JTD Spiral and their new combined sheet metal business complement their drone business. However, they don‚Äôt fit well together and seem to be doing significant business in completely different sectors. Likewise, Altia‚Äôs technology suits their security orientation but SPECTRUMebos seems tangential and either mirrors Altia‚Äôs software or is more corporate appropriate.

Furthermore, because of the use of LBO as an expansion method Alpine 4 has a significant debt burden of 24.144m USD and has negative CFO (-3.2m USD) and FCF (3.3m USD). In essence, Alpine 4 Holding looks like a cobbled together collection of companies which are all tangential to one another but are poorly integrated and in some ways redundant rather than synergistic. Looking purely at quantitative data; Alpine 4‚Äôs gross income is increasing and in 2019 represented 5.64m and saw sales revenue of 28.15m.

However, there is no listed expense in R&D from 2015-9. Furthermore, we‚Äôve seen a extremely marginal 1.4% ROA this year and a -21.3% ROCE, ROCE is perhaps more useful to examine because Alpine 4 is specialising in several capital intensive industries.

Alpine 4 brings to mind Valiant and other M&A focused companies in traditionally R&D heavy industries; the data seems to indicate Alpine 4 has substituted acquisitions for research and that‚Äôs a dangerous game. Furthermore, it‚Äôs high beta (12.8) is extremely unfavourable, especially when it‚Äôs share price has substantially collapsed since February.

1. Companies don‚Äôt need to actually benefit each other to be useful in a synergistic sense. The revenue from the stabilizers can be used to support the companies that are not yet profitable/ require larger capital to get started. 
2. VTOL is a huge deal with a fixed wing drone. Have you seen the drone? Do you know that their flight capacity is able to be 45 lbs for 6 hours at 100 mph. This blows all competitors out of the water. It can take off from a helo pad and then transition to fixed wing flight to maximize efficiency.

32,BOOM," You have to spend money to make money, their debt is decreasing, smartly so over time.

With Vayu and Impossible Aerospace, the drone market is about to absolutely BOOM and Alpine 4 has 2 companies specifically designed for this. They're both ready to be making sales in Q3 and best believe they're working together.

They're making much smart, and bigger moves in comparison to 2017, the driver companies they have are absolute beasts and in high demand right now with a full work staff, something most competitors do not have.

If Alpine 4 was in any way, shape or form struggling, or a ""malformed shambling monstrosity of a business"". They would have not retained 95% of their workforce when every other company in America was laying people off left right and centre during the pandemic.  This is a company who can see what's around the corner, and growing ridiculously quick with an uplist to a much bigger market (NASDAQ).

2) In the 16 months that I've been following ALPP, including a couple of profitable trades on them, I have never seen them market a product toward customers. I have only ever seen them market their stock toward investors. You know another company that does that? INND.


3) Lie after lie after lie about the NASDAQ uplisting. They applied too early, didn't meet all the requirements, and have to try again later. And that's fine. The problem is that K.W. insists on dangling this NASDAQ carrot in order to keep investors interested. If the company was so legit, he would spend that energy marketing their products to big-ticket customers, not communicating to us that NASDAQ is ""any day now"" for the last 7 months.

44,ARE," I can not seem to ever make a posting of my own. Therefore I'm here...

$PRPH showed back up once again on volume scans this week; way out side the norms. The weekly volume matched the exponential volume surge seen last August in the $2's that took it to the $16's by January. This time the volume surge has begun in the $5's which for me would indicate a broader extention to the upside of maybe $20-$25??The volume this week was news driven. Announcement of two new subsidiaries focused on genomics and antibody/antigen testing on a worldwide basis plus a conference presentation. Messages would indicate the CEO stated at a presentation they are about to announce the acquisition of a couple of labs for all sorts of testing for diseases and other ailments.Looking back to the BIG run up in January it seems to have been sparked by posting the BIGGEST profit ever by this CEO AND declaring yet another special dividend to shareholders. The CEO chose that opportunity to load the coffers with more cash for acquisitions.On the Earnings CC a month ago, CEO states he fully believes there is another enormous outbreak of Covid or a variant coming out of India and the company stands to reap a huge windfall in testing when that happens. In fact, he clearly states it has begun. Additionally, they now have their diet supplement business in 40000 retail locations in the US and it is doing record sales. in addition, the CEO states they are extremely close on an RFP for a national schools initiative that will be a huge transformational WIN for the company.What's interesting to note here is in posting the the largest profit under this CEO, he chose to announce the FOURTH special dividend for shareholders totaling $1.80 to date. Without this dividend, the company posted 36 cents per share vs. a loss of 7 cents a year ago.Dawson James Analyst Jason Kolbert who was present on that earnings CC put out his revised estimates for the company on June 10. THE NEXT 8 QUARTERS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE THE PREVIOUS YEAR PROFITS??Screaming BUY for me
