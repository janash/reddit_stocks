18,SPCE," I may get downvoted for this, but what is the long-term bull case for SPCE? 

The essence of it seems to be sales of a three-day experience that culminates in about 6 minutes of subspace flight ans weightlessness. The pricetag for which will supposedly be about $200k. That means your customer base is limited to the top 1%, who want to do it and can also pass a required physical. 

Any bull case also has to include a basically perfect safety record, once SPCE in the operational phase. A Concord-like accident would cause the stock price to half overnight, and likely dry up the reservation books. 

I'm not trying to be pessimistic. I'm a person who is very interested in space and spaceflight. And I think short-term calls are likely to print.

So when my friends and I are talking about video games (for our whole lives) we talk about the future. and its typically about the industry having to change from console and cartridges to subscription based online content. The retail location to buy sell and trade consoles (just like a blockbuster) will die. But guess what? Blockbuster showed the world what happens when you let a redbox and netflix come in for your tendies. You die, quick and hard. 

So why will Gamestop survive? I haven't seen this analogy so forgive me if it's not constructed correctly as I'm doing this freehand... just ask Nintendo. 

Nintendo owned the video game landscape before playstation came in and then xbox afterwards (don't forget NeoGeo in there along with others). Everyone always thought Nintendo would eventually fall out, but look at. their history. They'll come out with Pokemon Go and their stock goes bananas. They come out with switch and they can't keep them in stock. 

My point is that Nintendo has a brand, a great upper mgmt, great vision and cult level customer base.

Gamestop has a brand, a great upper mgmt and cult level customer base. 

I am not ready to say that Gamestop has great vision, but I think that will come out after the annual meeting when RC takes the reigns and can fully enact his directive. But because of his history at Chewy I'd have to say that great vision is at least implied. They at least have a great visionary.

Blockbuster showed the world what happens when you let a redbox and netflix come in for your tendies. You die, quick and hard. 

So why will Gamestop survive? I haven't seen this analogy so forgive me if it's not constructed correctly as I'm doing this freehand... just ask Nintendo. 

Nintendo owned the video game landscape before playstation came in and then xbox afterwards (don't forget NeoGeo in there along with others). Everyone always thought Nintendo would eventually fall out, but look at. their history. They'll come out with Pokemon Go and their stock goes bananas. They come out with switch and they can't keep them in stock. 

My point is that Nintendo has a brand, a great upper mgmt, great vision and cult level customer base.

Gamestop has a brand, a great upper mgmt and cult level customer base. 

I am not ready to say that Gamestop has great vision, but I think that will come out after the annual meeting when RC takes the reigns and can fully enact his directive. But because of his history at Chewy I'd have to say that great vision is at least implied. They at least have a great visionary.

69,GME," Take the lesson as a gift. There were likely signs that you either missed or willfully ignored. Next time, hold your singleness like you've held your GME and only sell for character and a real connection.

This is a dip in the stock ticker of life. Buy the lesson, hold for the love squeeze, and refrain from expensive gifts until you're certain it's authentic. Find a girl who is fine with eloping or more impressed by the specialness of a  simple wedding and the shared moment it represents. The rest is just window dressing and vanity and a red flag for materialism. Use the money you would have wasted on artificially inflated diamond prices and the wedding industry to buy an experience for you both to have as a couple. An experience that you will carry with you an remember for years. Take a long vacation in another country and grow together.

Money is great, tendies are fine, but only to a certain point. The real benefit of money is control over your very short time in this world. I'm successful and financially set, but looking back at my life, time is the most valuable resource there is, nothing comes close at all.

Tell me who's buying bonds at 2 or even 3% compared to investing in the actual market? Especially when the same people spreading fear about that are saying inflation will be 3%+. Your bonds will LOSE money.

242,BB," Fun story time. Grab a cold one and get ready.

I got in nearly perfectly before the initial BB hype caught on. I had 8C's + 10C's. Was even responsible and took some profits and rolled half the 10's into 15C's....I was jacked to the metaphorical tits to say the least...

I even told someone ""I've got a 1600% unrealized gain on BB calls""...the day was 1/27, shit was popping off...do you think I sold? **Nope!** Not even when it was a 2000%+ gain.

Fast forward several hours. All throughout that day I could have sold at great exit points and just taken the money and run. Even on 1/28 there were several hours where I could have taken insane gains before RobinHood did their rug pull bullshit https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-bars-users-from-buying-game-stop-stock-infuriating-its-users-144007484.html

I was aware they had blocked GME buying but because of the frenzy and my head not being clear, I didn't know they blocked BB too. Not that it would have changed anything because I'm too stupid to understand second-order effects. ""Oh, people can't buy? I can't believe it! That's outrageous!"" is as far as my degenerate monkey brain got. 

Only afterwards was I able to understand that not being able to buy implies only being able to sell. (Or hold, but let's be real...apes together strong is bullshit, this isn't a team sport). If I didn't make the logical leap to step 2, I certainly didn't make it to step 3 which was: if people can't buy, and can only sell, then the price will go down bigly because of supply and demand.

All I needed to do was set some reasonable limit orders...or at least a stop loss. To have some kind of a plan.

But I somehow got it into my head that it could go to $40. It never even occurred to me think about *why* it was up so much and how precarious it all was. It had gone from $4...to $6...to $8...to $25+ in a matter of days. My brain thought that was somehow totally normal and it would be reasonable to not take *any* gains and to expect it to go up even more.

Since the price moves up and down - support and resistance are fluid - especially with short term trends -  support can become resistance and resistance can become support. Supports and resistances are best used for determining your enter and exit points - to help you strategize  your moves for the day.

**What is a support actually? If SP break some line and stay above that line? If don't stay above that line that's also support? What is resistance then? Based on your argument you can call any line above or below as support. Even when SP goes up and down above and below that line multiple times. You are now completely changing the meaning of support.**

Note: This is just talking about the 5m timeframe. Your SMMAs are going to be different on longer timeframes. This is why using multiple timeframes is very important in determining mid-term and long-term trends (with long-term trends this is why you hear ""stonks only go up"".) Look at spy longterm - it only goes up.

The strength of a support is determined  by how many times the prices ""bounces off it""  Same for the strength of a resistance. (I could get into top call/put strikes and max pain and other spotgamma data but I'm just really addressing SMMAs)

If you're interested in options data: [https://spotgamma.com/products/](https://spotgamma.com/products/)

I pointed out that the 20 smma was a good support indicator on 5/20 since it bounced off it a few times throughout the day. This indicated that the bulls were in charge for the day - notice the strong uptrend by how far spread out your 20, 60, and 120 SMMAs are?

When the price consolidates around an SMMA it means that there is a battle and a possible reversal may take place. For example, if in a downtrend - bulls need to increase buying pressure to have a reversal.

Notice how we had that blow-off top at around 418 and had a very bearish engulfing candle throw us back down into the 417-418 resistance range? That told me that there was a good chance that we were going to test the 20 SMMA for support.

If support held, we may see a reversal back up to 418 but if it failed then watch out. So, look at the battle that took place and notice that the price moved in and out of the 20 SMMA. The price essentially consolidated. And remember the definition of consolidation: ""Consolidation is the term for a stock or security that is neither continuing nor reversing a larger price trend. Consolidated stocks typically trade within limited price ranges and offer relatively few trading opportunities until another pattern emerges.""

Here is the consolidation I'm talking about: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/uZCZcYcZ/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uZCZcYcZ/)

Bulls and bears are battling. Once we broke out of that consolidation range. The bears gained the 20 SMMA as resistance and were now in control until the bulls found support at the 120 SMMA.

**You are saying at higher prices such as 419, 420, 422 you are bullish but you do understand that price goes higher when demand is more than supply, right? You also understand that if price goes up then RSI will also goes up, right? Which means RSI can go to overbought territory.**

I provide bullish and bearish price targets for the day. This means that I'm trimming or taking profits if we hit those levels. I will also take profit if we are near a highlighted resistance or support level. Especially if indicators are telling me that we are overbought or oversold. If we break through resistance and find support on top of that resistance line then I'll enter back in. Inverse if bear.

Yes. I know that RSI can go past 70. It all depends on risk management. If i'm playing 0dte and we are near oversold or overbought I will secure profits. I got kids to feed friend :)

**Next Monday if SPY goes to $419.7 and RSI goes to 82. Now you are in bullish territory based of SPY price but RSI is indicating over bought. Will you buy call or puts? Because whatever you buy you will contradict yourself.**

I would have already taken profit since it hit a bullish price target. Then i'll reassess  and determine my next play based on current trend and indicators.

Truthfully, If i make a good play and make good money I'll be done for the day and wait for the market to close to analyze and strategize for the next day. A lot of times I only make about 1-3 trades per day. There have been times where I don't make any trades because I'm not seeing a favorable set-up - especially if I'm not already playing.

I pointed out that the 20 smma was a good support indicator on 5/20 since it bounced off it a few times throughout the day. This indicated that the bulls were in charge for the day - notice the strong uptrend by how far spread out your 20, 60, and 120 SMMAs are?

When the price consolidates around an SMMA it means that there is a battle and a possible reversal may take place. For example, if in a downtrend - bulls need to increase buying pressure to have a reversal.

Notice how we had that blow-off top at around 418 and had a very bearish engulfing candle throw us back down into the 417-418 resistance range? That told me that there was a good chance that we were going to test the 20 SMMA for support.

If support held, we may see a reversal back up to 418 but if it failed then watch out. So, look at the battle that took place and notice that the price moved in and out of the 20 SMMA. The price essentially consolidated. And remember the definition of consolidation: ""Consolidation is the term for a stock or security that is neither continuing nor reversing a larger price trend. Consolidated stocks typically trade within limited price ranges and offer relatively few trading opportunities until another pattern emerges.""

Here is the consolidation I'm talking about: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/uZCZcYcZ/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uZCZcYcZ/)

Bulls and bears are battling. Once we broke out of that consolidation range. The bears gained the 20 SMMA as resistance and were now in control until the bulls found support at the 120 SMMA.

**You are saying at higher prices such as 419, 420, 422 you are bullish but you do understand that price goes higher when demand is more than supply, right? You also understand that if price goes up then RSI will also goes up, right? Which means RSI can go to overbought territory.**

I provide bullish and bearish price targets for the day. This means that I'm trimming or taking profits if we hit those levels. I will also take profit if we are near a highlighted resistance or support level. Especially if indicators are telling me that we are overbought or oversold. If we break through resistance and find support on top of that resistance line then I'll enter back in. Inverse if bear.

Yes. I know that RSI can go past 70. It all depends on risk management. If i'm playing 0dte and we are near oversold or overbought I will secure profits. I got kids to feed friend :)

**Next Monday if SPY goes to $419.7 and RSI goes to 82. Now you are in bullish territory based of SPY price but RSI is indicating over bought. Will you buy call or puts? Because whatever you buy you will contradict yourself.**

I would have already taken profit since it hit a bullish price target. Then i'll reassess  and determine my next play based on current trend and indicators.

Truthfully, If i make a good play and make good money I'll be done for the day and wait for the market to close to analyze and strategize for the next day. A lot of times I only make about 1-3 trades per day. There have been times where I don't make any trades because I'm not seeing a favorable set-up - especially if I'm not already playing. 

**What period you used to calculate RSI in that chart? I can show that SPY was never overbought or never oversold on Friday just by changing the parameters.**

Since the price moves up and down - support and resistance are fluid - especially with short term trends -  support can become resistance and resistance can become support. Supports and resistances are best used for determining your enter and exit points - to help you strategize  your moves for the day.

**What is a support actually? If SP break some line and stay above that line? If don't stay above that line that's also support? What is resistance then? Based on your argument you can call any line above or below as support. Even when SP goes up and down above and below that line multiple times. You are now completely changing the meaning of support.**

You use SMMAs a lot but it appeared to me from your comments that you are not completely aware of what they are doing really. SMMA is a moving average filter and one of the parameter is the how many data points you are taking to calculate that average. You can take 20, 50, 60, 100, 150, 200 etc. If a stock or ETF or any financial instrument is on a consistent uptrend then following will be true-

  
1.	Price chart will be always above the SMMA lines except when there is a strong downtrend.  
2.	20-day SMMA will be closer to actual price movement, 50-day SMMA will be below 20-day SMMA, 100-day SMMA will be below 50-day SMMA, 1. 200-day SMMA will be below 100-day SMMA and so on.  


On a consistent downtrend, the exact opposite will be true. The larger day SMMA will be far above the instrument price. That's just the nature of the filter itself. A 200-day SMMA line is still influenced by stock price 200-days ago but a 20-day SMMA line is only affected by last 20 day price action. On a consistent uptrend a instrument price will be much smaller 200 days ago compare to 20 days ago because it's a consistent uptrend.  
For the same reason at extended consolidation period, these SMMA curves will go across the price actions. The less the number of days you take account (20 vs 60) the more it (SMMA) will be closer to actual price action.  
  
  
**What is my point here:** 

**You can not or should should not use an SMMA whether it's 20-day or 60-day as support or resistance because SMMA does not determine the price action of a financial instrument rather it's completely the other way around. Price action of a financial instrument (Stonks, ETF etc.) shape the SMMA curve/lines.** If you do not understand this ask me I can talk all day if I have time.

OP, I asked you specifically with price and RSI whether you will buy calls or puts and you answered you will sell at that moment.   
When did you buy those that you are talking about selling at the condition I mentioned? Your bullish target was above $419 and bearish target was below $412 for 5/24. SPY was between $414.45 and $418.2 on Friday and closed at $414.94. It was never in your bullish or bearish territory based on the outlook you provided for 05/24 (Monday). Market is not open yet for 05/24 so when did you buy the positions you are referring to trim at my proposed price target and RSI?  


Your outlook for 05/21 was Bullish/Neutral. While SPY did gap up slightly but it was a downtrend for half of the day from the beginning of the market. The rest half was jerking off movements. It was never really bullish or bearish on that day. Now let me ask you again-  


**OP did you open position expiring on 05/24? If you did then based on what exactly? If you did not then why are you talking about taking profit for those imaginary positions that you have not bought yet?**  


Let me ask the same question with more clearly-  


**If tomorrow Monday (05/24) SPY gap up and open at $419.7 and RSI at 82 at market open, you will in bullish territory based of SPY price but RSI is indicating over bought. Will you buy call or puts? Because whatever you buy you will contradict yourself.**  


**If SPY open flat at $415 and moderate RSI at 45, you are neither in bullish territory nor in bearish based on SPY price and RSI is neither indicating over bought or oversold. Will you buy call or puts? Why?**

Based on your argument you can call any line above or below as support. Even when SP goes up and down above and below that line multiple times.

>Since the price moves up and down - support and resistance are fluid - especially with short term trends - support can become resistance and resistance can become support. Supports and resistances are best used for determining your enter and exit points - to help you strategize your moves for the day.

**OP define support first and then discuss the properties of support!** You said support can become resistance and resistance can become support. But what is support? What is resistance? If you do not define clearly what is support first then rest of your text are pointless. Let me do the job for you from borrowing the definition from Investopedia, which you like to refer. The next paragraph is copied from Investopedia-

From here: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/support.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/support.asp)

**What Is Support?**

Support, or a support level, refers to the price level that an asset does not fall below for period of time. An asset's support level is created by buyers entering the market whenever the asset dips to a lower price. In technical analysis, the simple support level can be charted by drawing a line along the lowest lows for the time period being considered. The support line can be flat or slanted up or down with the overall price trend. Other technical indicators and charting techniques can be used to identify more advanced versions of support.

Similarly the definition of Resistance from the same source-

**What Is Resistance?**

Resistance, or a resistance level, is the price at which the price of an asset meets pressure on its way up by the emergence of a growing number of sellers who wish to sell at that price. Resistance levels can be short-lived if new information comes to light that changes the overall market’s attitude toward the asset, or they can be long-lasting. In terms of technical analysis, the simple resistance level can be charted by drawing a line along the highest highs for the time period being considered. Resistance can be contrasted with support.

**Simplify this way:** 

For the time being considered, price will be above the support level and below Resistance level.

**Why I ever asked you any questions:** 

*Because you kept referring 20 SMMA as support and then as resistance when it met the definition of neither for the time being considered. Because SPY went down that 20 SMMA level several time so it was not a support. Similarly SPY went above that level several times so it was not a resistance.*

**The definition of the support and resistance is the reason TA traders try to enter a long (i.e. call) position around support level because they believe that price will bounce up from that level and will not fall below that level. Which means he can sell his calls the way up and make profit**. But if he sees that price doing up and down from a level he will not consider it a support or resistance because that level (20 SMMA in your chart) does not meet the definition of support neither it meet the definition of resistance.

280,GME," Well, ""we're"" not ""bumping"" GME to anything. If you believe in the company it makes sense to invest in that company.

In terms of turning options into profit, gotta recognize when to buy 'em and when to sell 'em.

I very rarely go long on options without it being a part of a spread. Saw a strong buy signal on these based on my anal-ysis.

Considering picking up more if it stays under $30 this week (always hoping for a dip on the strats I'm confident on).

281,GME," To grossly over simplify it: if you draw a chart with today's price and date and the options expiration price and date, with a straight line connecting the two, you'll see the rate the stock has to grow to maintain the current option price.

At any point the price is above that average linear trajectory, the option is worth more than you paid for it. At any date/price combination it is below the line it is worth less than you paid for it.

And of course there's IV inflation/crush, and many *many* other factors. But that's the simplest form.

Can make a ton of money buying options that never hit, if you know when to buy/sell.

When IV is super high, it's a good time to sell (and I've seen GME break 1,000% and 1,300% IV before on totally separate dates). When it's low, might be a good time to buy, as long as you have a firm belief on the direction the stock is going to move!

284,GME," IV is an indicator which adjusts during / after the fact, not before.

High IV = high premium cost. Low IV = low premium cost.

For GME, anywhere around 100% IV is shockingly low. And with all the hype building for some key events in June, I'm surprised IV hasn't inflated much yet.

Options IV and resulting premiums have already started climbing (hence the paper gainz shown here).

If and when the price starts swinging wildly, IV will shoot up, inflating options prices with it.

299,DKNG," Counterpoint: them being the current legal market leader is likely a *weakness.*

While DKNG engages in daily fantasy, which other major books don't, I'd argue that for most serious bettors, apps like betMGM which come with an extremely well known betting brand.

DKNG will need to up it's tech investment, e.g. by committing to being a partner or owner of FuboTV (bringing DKNG's sizeable existing audience to FUBO's unique value prop), or risk losing edge. (MGM for example has captured Yahoo as a partner, which has a significant Fantasy Sports presence).

[This article](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/45871/us-sports-betting-race-for-third/) while acknowledging the lead for DKNG, has a lot of information suggesting that there's going to be further division of the online sports betting market.

&nbsp;

That said, given that legalization is spreading, the entire market is going to grow by so much, higher price targets across the board for all involved major players is probably a viable option.

Less bullish than you but I've convinced myself while writing this that DKNG is probably undervalued in the long run due to the expanding addressable market.",cantadmittoposting,17,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nivg4v/why_im_gay_for_dickkings_dkng/gz45sgg/,0.026,0.888,0.086,0.7825

Second, I want to comment about the Dish rumors.  It will happen, Stanton Dodge (Chief Legal Officer of DraftKings) was Ergen's cheif  legal counsel at Dish for 21 years (linkedin is your freind).  This two are thick as theives. 

 Stanton's legal career  in CO is legendary with rumors dating back to Stanton sleeping in his car in the Dish parking lot when he started as an intern and who rose through the ranks to be Charlie Ergen's right hand legal guy.  All the Dish attorney's worked for him; so both companies have key relationships to strike a deal.   I'm very bullish on a deal being made,  and a big one at that.

344,DKNG," MGM is an established casino company. They have land casinos so doesn’t PENN. Those will always be profitable establishments and they aren’t going anywhere. What limits the two of them is they aren’t solely focused on expanding mobile gambling and igaming like Fan Duel and DKNG.

MGM’s approach is to wait for states to legalize and drop books a few months after legislation.

DraftKings plan is to establish a presence in the legislative process, and be the FIRST bookie offered in that state. 

Igaming and sportsbook market is the future of gambling and has the potential to be a $500 billion industry in the next 10 years. When people have ability to gamble from their couch they will go to the first book that was offered to them, hence, First to Market Advantage. 

Also, DKNG recognizes that the igaming and sportsbook industry is more complicated than just gambling from your phone. It is literally the next big tech, and they’re willing to make partnerships with these massive companies like ESPN, like Dish Network, possibly Fubo or Netflix to become another tech giant.

547,IBRX," Yeah people will get BCG, chemo, or surgery for bladder cancer.  Obviously, people prefer to stay away from the ladder.  Chemo and surgery are obviously most common for pretty much all solid tumors.  The big take away is that IBRX got 71% complete responses meaning the cancer dissappeared for patients who failed previous therapies.  Anktiva's side-effects are very light compared to chemo so I would assume people would prefer that to chemo. IBRX is actually working on pancreatic cancer which is usually very aggressive.  They had really good prelim trial numbers reported in January.
