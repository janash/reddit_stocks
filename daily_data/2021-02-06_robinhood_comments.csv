3,RH, I have yet to find another broker that will allow me to trade on unsettled funds. Do you know of any? I do agree that RH was underhanded here however I find it hard to move away from the firm because of the flexibility they offer.,milsathecat,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/ldm53t/caught_in_the_act_photographic_evidence_of_robin/gm9iea7/,0.076,0.784,0.14,0.4767

18,GME," That person was going to run themselves off a cliff one day or another anyway. 

All the people who held on too long were going to get burned no matter how high it went. It could have gone to $20k a share and they still would have held right back down to $50 a share. 

It's in their nature. My brother in law loses obscene amounts of money in the casino. He tossed $250,000 into the slot machines one year. 

He would have tossed it into GME or into the Casino or whatever. It's in their nature. 

Personally I made money. I understood that it was too late to turn $10,000 into a million. I just tossed $300 and turned it into $1400 then gave another $350 back after I jumped back in. 

I'm not a compulsive gambler though. 

It still doesn't mean that what RH did was okay by any stretch of the imagination..

21,BB," Well if you put it that way, I see your point. I mean I made a lil money of GME but I would‚Äôve never risked a huge portion of my trading, I‚Äôm very skeptical about these stocks that randomly shoot up, I know that they are going to randomly drop, 

Regardless that GME frenzy was a phase and  let it steer me off crosse from my plan, I made back the gains from buying into amc and BB and kissing like 1k together I cut my loses and ran said fucking I missed the run now I gotta flip some shit to get my profits back and then some...
