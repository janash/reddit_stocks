For instance, maybe the stock has lost momentum and I don’t want to hang around to see if it could regain it. Also, maybe news comes in that says it’s time. I did that with MRK when I found out that Buffett had sold; turns out it was the right move, because MRK has stagnated since.

I guess though if I truly believed the stock was overvalued, I'd probably sell it. I'm tempted by £PETS because it seems expensive. If MSFT went to $400 tomorrow, I'm taking that profit and putting it elsewhere. If it's ""expensive"" but I have faith in the company, I'll consider buying, if it's ""overpriced"" I won't, and if I hold, I'll sell.

The only one I might recommend is VYM. 0.06% expense ratio and solid blue chips in the portfolio.

But it is a  lot safer obviously. Another possibly ok one is SCHD. You will need to do your own DD on these two ETFs.

I strongly suggest you buy your own dividend stocks. There are plenty of long term safe plays that yield 3% or so. If you want higher, then you need to delve into REITs.

102,ALL," I’m doing something similar! I’ve got around 200, counting etfs.

There are just so many (seemingly) good plays with different philosophies out there. Green energy, brown energy, tech, finance, autonomous vehicles, electric cars, reopening plays (travel etc), a few irresponsible wsb yolos, the list goes on.

Like you I’m going to see how my small amounts play out in the short term and add to what looks promising longer term.

The problem is, will success continue? Like, SPCE might jump from 50 to 100 tomorrow because of the launch today.Since it does well, maybe I double my investment. But then it calms down because nothing new happens and returns to like 60 over the next 3 months. Suddenly my investment is NOT doing well. So it is tricky.

Right now I’m narrowly beating the SP500 so I’ll continue. At some point I will decide what to trim.

I DONT advise selling anything red, however. My small starter investments are meant to be money lost. I will hold until green.

My plan tho is sell what is positive return but lower than SP500, keep and buy more of what is positive return BEYOND SP500.

It helps because my strategy for ALL of my stocks and etfs is long term hold. I have not purchased anything I don’t feel comfortable holding for less than 5 years, and I understand it might take that long to get any profit from some of them. So as far as I understand, the naysayers here who say it is “too much to keep track of” are missing the point. I *don’t buy* things that I feel I have to micromanage and check each day and make sure it is not “yikes it is going to zero today i need to sell!” Instead I’m confident all will go up long term, tho I accept that I WILL be wrong on a number of them, and accept that some money will be lost.

103,SPCE," I’m doing something similar! I’ve got around 200, counting etfs.

There are just so many (seemingly) good plays with different philosophies out there. Green energy, brown energy, tech, finance, autonomous vehicles, electric cars, reopening plays (travel etc), a few irresponsible wsb yolos, the list goes on.

Like you I’m going to see how my small amounts play out in the short term and add to what looks promising longer term.

The problem is, will success continue? Like, SPCE might jump from 50 to 100 tomorrow because of the launch today.Since it does well, maybe I double my investment. But then it calms down because nothing new happens and returns to like 60 over the next 3 months. Suddenly my investment is NOT doing well. So it is tricky.

Right now I’m narrowly beating the SP500 so I’ll continue. At some point I will decide what to trim.

I DONT advise selling anything red, however. My small starter investments are meant to be money lost. I will hold until green.

My plan tho is sell what is positive return but lower than SP500, keep and buy more of what is positive return BEYOND SP500.

It helps because my strategy for ALL of my stocks and etfs is long term hold. I have not purchased anything I don’t feel comfortable holding for less than 5 years, and I understand it might take that long to get any profit from some of them.

105,AMT," I’d venture to guess having >50 individual stock positions is somewhat rare for the average retail investor and >100 and very rare. That’s why you’ll get people who see “I have 100 positions” who instantly respond with “lol you’ve only built an ETF.” I’ve had plenty of people tell me that when I’ve mentioned how many positions I have. They say I’m diversified too much with the added risk of picking stocks. What they fail to ask if what are my holdings in. Currently, nearly 3/4 of my portfolios are in IT, consumer discretionary, and health care. I’m far from diversified. I also only have 29 stocks that are in SPY and 19 that are in QQQ. I am seeking response risk since I plan to be invested for 30+ more years. 

Just realized I’m rambling about me lol. In regards to your positions, I’ll stick with what I originally said. Sell anything you don’t have 100% conviction in. It doesn’t have to be a mass selling. You could do it over 6-12 months or something. I have a Sell Watchlist that I occasionally add positions to that I’m wavering on. I’ll pay a bit more attention to them, news around them, their earnings, investor call, etc. to see if my investment thesis still holds. If it doesn’t, I sell. A stock usually sits on that watchlist for 3-6 months before I sell it or decide I still want to be invested. It works for me. Maybe something like that would work for you and help you pare down from 150 to only the companies you really want to own. 

I perused your list. I don’t recognize some and don’t have the time to look them up now but my 2 cents on a few that aren’t in your keep section:

I own and wouldn’t consider selling: APPN, CRWD, ETSY, ISRG, MELI, SE, SQ, ZS, AMT, 

I own and wouldn’t consider selling but would understand why someone else would: APPH, FSLY, NIO, SNOW, TDOC, 

I don’t own CRM but I expect I will soon. 

Of the ones I mentioned above, MELI and ISRG are two of my highest conviction holdings. MELI in particular. It’s my 3rd largest position. They are an incredible company growing shockingly fast (hello Mercado Pago!) and they aren’t even an 80B MC company yet.

Just realized I’m rambling about me lol. In regards to your positions, I’ll stick with what I originally said. Sell anything you don’t have 100% conviction in. It doesn’t have to be a mass selling. You could do it over 6-12 months or something. I have a Sell Watchlist that I occasionally add positions to that I’m wavering on. I’ll pay a bit more attention to them, news around them, their earnings, investor call, etc. to see if my investment thesis still holds. If it doesn’t, I sell. A stock usually sits on that watchlist for 3-6 months before I sell it or decide I still want to be invested. It works for me. Maybe something like that would work for you and help you pare down from 150 to only the companies you really want to own.

125,ON," Yes and that is why broad market index funds are invested. If you own VTI (vanguard total stock market) it covers EVERY stock in the entire U.S. market except the 3% or so that is not covered in the microcap world.  So that one holding covers EVERY stock in every industry in every sector.

When you are picking stocks ON TOP of that you are betting/ gambling/ speculating you think one of those stocks are somehow mispriced despite the MILLIONS of professional and amateur eyes watching it every day and thus choose to overweight it in the portfolio. That is fine with a few stocks, but the issue with that many is even if you are right and that stock goes up MUCH higher the impact to the total portfolio value is so small since the % allocated to it is so small.",10xwannabe,1,/r/stocks/comments/ohvzti/way_too_many_stocks_to_choose_from/h4uhw8c/,0.012,0.932,0.056,0.656

When the index has made an ATH, there’s a 0,15% chance that there will be a 20% drop within 90 days. That’s less than 2 times out of 1000. And there’s a 7 in a 1000 chance that the index will fall over 10% within 90 days.
