1,DKNG," Sell DKNG. This is from someone who has had the stock since $20. 

For one, if you actually sports bet like I do, you know DraftKings is by far the shittiest mobile app. FanDuel, Barstool, and and BetRivers all blow it out of the water. I hate clicking on an event only for it to take 30 seconds for it to load. 

Also this company is still not profitable, and guessing which sports book will survive in such a new industry is too big of a crapshoot. BETZ is a good ETF for sports betting if you want to diversify. 

Also all that ""official partner"" to leagues stuff is bullshit. That doesn't give them sports data for betting lines. You know who does? It's a duopoly between Genius Sports ($GENI) and Sportradar (rumors of an IPO on the horizon). I'd much rather invest in one or both of those since it's the backbone of the industry.

You know what DraftKings is actually good at compared to other sportsbooks? Casino promos and spending money on advertising",CptMcCuddles,-13,/r/stocks/comments/oz68w9/draftkings_stock_jumps_on_narrowerthanexpected/h7y14gs/,0.079,0.869,0.052,-0.7944

3,DFS," Just for a little more detail for everybody on here. DraftKings recently dropped DFS in Oregon because there was some questions about the legality of it under state law but seemingly only did so to sweeten the relationship between them and the Oregon Lottery as DraftKings is basically looking to become the sole sports betting operator in Oregon.

Basically, in DraftKings' eyes  Sports Betting > DFS

4,UI," Sports betting degenerate from NJ here. I have two books I mainly use: draftkings and fanduels.

I agree they have the shittiest mobile app. This is definitely true. But you know what else is true? I get better betting odds on single bets with draftkings vs. fanduels. Fanduel's same game parlays are available whereas draftkings does not have that. However, it looks like they will, which makes fanduels to me inferior.

The UI is the second most important thing for me for sportsbook phone apps. Betting odds are the most important. I'll take a shitty UI with better odds than a great UI with worse odds.

This is more important to me than the UI.

Edit: I realize as I made this post I should be more specific about which odds are better. I found that ATTS or ""Any time touchdown scorer"" for NFL games typically have better odds on draftkings than on fanduels. However, I can parlay multiple people in the same game to score on fanduels, whereas on draftkings I can pick one player from any game played to pair with another player in another game.

12,NBA," It depends on what you look at imo. For example, for the NBA FanDuel will have ""to score 30+, to score 40+"" as options that you can parlay. However, on DraftKings they only have an over/under for each player. So if Westbrook's o/u is 23.5 but you think he's popping off tonight, you can do ""to score 40+"" on FanDuel, but on DraftKings you're limited to just the o/u.

75,IMO," Sorry I didn't quite get that.

it still doesn't matter.  How much $$ was the 100% gain?  IMO if it's less than $2000, it's pocket change.  You have to think long term.  What will $2K buy when you retire?  I'm not that far from retirement but I'm not going to sell a $2K gain to protect it.  I'm looking for a $50K gain.  Strong upward stocks often signal rising future price.  Not a guarantee, but a good indicator.

Also - again - when would you have sold?  How would you have picked the ""top""?  You probably would have missed alot of the gain when yo sold anyway.

However, I'm not to keen on being deep in the red, fundamentals or not.  I enter a position with a small amount of money, so the percentage drop can be reasonably large and I don't lose much.  But if it gets to 500 down, I just sell.

Once I have a position that has a solid gain, it doesn't bother me if the variation is large.",hendrix_srv,3,/r/stocks/comments/oyx595/when_people_are_long_on_a_stock_do_they_actually/h7wfrh4/,0.082,0.728,0.19,0.9772

168,IMO," I suspect that if you get another near 1 million jobs print with August payrolls, that you'll at least see an announcement of tapering of MBS purchases in September, but I think even that wouldn't take place immediately, it'd be them announcing it to start at X date.

I see that there are still people with the misconception of tapering=interest rate hikes. They are ""NOT"" one in the same. Personally, I've been thinking that they will start to taper near the end of the year or early next. I heard somebody say yesterday that this has apparently been what's getting priced into the market even as yes, markets stay resilient. So, tapering might not be what matters honestly. What may matter is interest rate hikes, which is a ways away IMO even if I really don't think tapering is that far away.

Now maybe the doubters of the Fed get proven right though about them being scared to do anything. We shall see as I'll be surprised if we close out the year with no tapering announcement tbh.",95Daphne,-4,/r/stocks/comments/oz3a2y/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_aug/h7y9a97/,0.066,0.854,0.08,0.5774

220,HUGE," I believe they will keep growing. They continue to have great earnings.

The move towards services seems to be working, so they'll be recurring revenue from that as more people sign up. Apple Arcade, Apple News, Apple TV, Apple Fitness etc. All of these services are still new and have lot of room to grow and become big. Apple fitness could include hardware in 10 years time, you never know.

They are also continuing the vertical integration for all their products. The latest being CPUs for all their PCs. The CPUs are insanely powerful and we're only at the first iteration. It's going to mean more integration between iPhone/iPad/Laptop. iOS apps will run on macs very soon for example.

221,TV," I believe they will keep growing. They continue to have great earnings.

The move towards services seems to be working, so they'll be recurring revenue from that as more people sign up. Apple Arcade, Apple News, Apple TV, Apple Fitness etc. All of these services are still new and have lot of room to grow and become big. Apple fitness could include hardware in 10 years time, you never know.

They are also continuing the vertical integration for all their products. The latest being CPUs for all their PCs. The CPUs are insanely powerful and we're only at the first iteration. It's going to mean more integration between iPhone/iPad/Laptop. iOS apps will run on macs very soon for example.

An interesting fact of data: Since 1927, there has been a 97% chance for the S&P 500 to make a new ATH in the next 90 days when it has already been in an ATH. There was a 0,20% chance to face a drop of 20% or higher in the next 90 days.",juaggo_,2,/r/stocks/comments/ozcsfu/buying_at_all_time_highs/h7yuz9u/,0.025,0.896,0.079,0.5574
268,ATH," Well, it's good to buy and at the time of the decision, if you think it's gonna keep going up, then time in is better than timing.

That said, I personally dont buy at all time highs unless I know with near certainty that the stocks gonna keep climbing.  It's an ATH, it's bound to sell off at some point, after all.

For exact.timing on the day I buy, I try to wait for a day low RSI of 40 or lower and weekly or 10 day average point to buy, so I'm getting it for a fair price.",Disposable_Canadian,0,/r/stocks/comments/ozcsfu/buying_at_all_time_highs/h7ytlfw/,0.042,0.839,0.119,0.7845

270,AMD," There are good buys out there currently, and we've had some dips with great buying opportunities.

Around 3 months ago I bought Apple at $120 and AMD at $75 after watching price action for months.

I bought a bunch of VOO on July 19th when it dipped to $388, now $406.

There are rarely times something is extremely undervalued, but you can get relatively good or even great deals if you wait and are opportunistic. That said, I don't exactly DCA, but I buy regularly and more when there are significant dips. Buying regularly will eventually pay off even if things dip from your initial entry point.

My 2 cents: if you are wanting the advice from strangers on the internet of what to buy and when, just stick to ETFs until you feel ready to make some picks with confidence. Or just stick with ETFs, nothing wrong with ETFs.",ElectricLotus,1,/r/stocks/comments/ozeqsu/advise_request/h7z8ljk/,0.017,0.806,0.177,0.9804
271,NIO," In my humble opinion NIO is quite a good stock to buy, they are quite literally the tsla of china, and they are still a growth company that slid from they're high of 66.99 due to a chip shortage crisis. So its quite cheap now at 44$. 
Strictly going by potential, its a nice option for investment.
But, and this is a big but, not for too long, since it is actually a Chinese company, but its too small to be considered a threat to the Chinese government's controlling narrative. I'd say for about 3 - 4 years it is a solid play, since 24% of the market cap is owned by the government, they will support and require success...",derangedpenis,0,/r/stocks/comments/ozeqsu/advise_request/h7z9zoa/,0.07,0.813,0.117,0.5714
