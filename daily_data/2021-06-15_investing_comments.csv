10,AMC," It is true that GME was the original meme stock, as the amount of shorts on it were truly astronomical. That being said, I disagree with you about the fundamentals: GME was a chain of failing retail stores whose market share was being diminished by the very consoles they sold in the form of digital games. They tried to enter the used electronic market and the collectible market with little success. GME is still light-years away from a dominant business model, even if their meme stock fame ultimately gave them a second chance. AMC on the other hand is the most successful Movie Theater chain in the country, and also are a dominant player internationally. There was little doubt that they would be able to recover once the lockdowns ended, which makes one wonder why they were shorted to a similar extent as GME. Since their debut as a meme stock they've converted $600M of debt to stock and accumulated $1B in liquidity, meaning that they are now in a position to buy up rivals who could not endure the lockdown. Already they are eyeing some of the best theaters out West as prime acquisition targets. So fundamentals wise, I think AMC wins every time, and that's reflected in the fact that AMC has outperformed all other stocks this year, even GME at the height of it's gamma squeeze.

Edit: not sure if the downvoting is GME fans or just people who don't like meme stocks in general. If you like GME, buy GME (I have a small GME position myself).

51,IMO," Is it a taxable account or a Roth IRA? 

The sp 500 has a really low dividend yield right now. I think it makes sense to trim asset appreciation off to bring that yield up to 3%. So trim .25% every month and build up a cash position for buying the dip. Think of it like a dividend that you're letting accumulate. 

Trimming small amounts like that can be a rational move. 

The thing with timing the market is you have no idea what's going to happen. We may see a 15% correction by August. Or it may go up 10%. Who knows. 

IMO the s&p500 is not overvalued based on historical standards, interest rates or current earnings. It's current price is rational given the environment. But I expect that environment to change. Stimulus to run out. Interest rates may change. But I can't predict the future so there's no point in trying.",BeaverWink,2,/r/investing/comments/o0cqt1/should_i_take_profits_from_index_fund_when_market/h1udnjt/,0.04,0.873,0.087,0.7433
52,AAPL," No.

You weigh your options ""at the moment""

* Is there a better investment that you would put the money into?
* Do you need the cash now?
* Are you transitioning in life, such as retiring?

If the answer is no to the above, then what will happen is that you'll suddenly find yourself sitting on cash and not knowing what your next move is.  Plan ahead.

If you're selling VTI for AAPL, then is the exchange ""at the moment"" right for you?  E.g. is AAPL trading low and VTI trading higher?  Is there a stock that you want to get into ""at the moment"" as another way to say it.  

Again, otherwise you'll wind up sitting on cash, doing your research and risk the FOMO moment leading to a bad investment choice.",Qs9bxNKZ,1,/r/investing/comments/o0cqt1/should_i_take_profits_from_index_fund_when_market/h1w0eqy/,0.094,0.875,0.03,-0.8343
53,ATH," I disagree with most people in that part of being patient is waiting for a better purchase price. Selling at ATH is reasonable if you’re willing to wait to come back again.

54,USA," You should have a more balanced portfolio.  You have every reason to be concerned about 100% VTI.  Now would be a good time to decide on an asset allocation you like.  My usual recommendation for a first asset allocation book: https://www.amazon.com/Four-Pillars-Investing-Building-Portfolio/dp/1932378014

If you mean pull money out of VTI to go to cash that's a bad idea.  Glidepathing is worth about 20 basis points per year.  Being in stocks vs. cash is worth about 500 basis points per year.  That's on top of the taxes. You are going to be right rather quickly or you are going to need to be very patient and then jump in to a very distressed market.  

And frankly if you are that aggressive about distressed markets you would be doing that now.

The fed raising rates wouldn't help people get into homes. Higher interest rates would mean higher mortgage payments. 

IMO the best thing for the housing market is to wait it out. Demand is falling due to rising prices. Lumber supply is coming back online. Once lumber prices come down people will start building houses. We also have the eviction ban ending. Not sure if that will effect supply or not.

88,DD," This is a vastly underlooked component. Consider this: you wake up today and suddenly have $1M in the market. A 4% value add would enhance your portfolio YoY by $40k, and simultaneously lower your risk exposure.

I find quite often that retail investors have trouble comprehending ROI over long term horizons and see larger numbers as better without understanding risk as a fundamental component. It prevents those with say, $1000 from investing in a Buy and Hold ETF because short term, the results are boring. Instead, they/we believe that doing our own DD, buying equities and selling has a higher degree of certainty to yield better results.

111,IMO," I'm a bit new to investing in ETFs. Mostly, I started out with a handful of Vanguard funds that have low expenses ratios, but now I am moving into other areas. I have come across some that have strong growth but also a pretty high expense ration. Two examples I have are TECL and SOXL. The holding within these funds I feel good about. But then I began reading up on leveraged funds and keep finding information saying that they are very risky. Maybe I don't quite understand the leveraging component of the fund. The other common thing I read is that you should not invest long term in these as they are again, risky and heavily impacted by volatility. If one of these funds has a strong 5yr or 10yr growth, why wouldn't you invest long term? I understand that the expense ratio is high, but 1% IMO is acceptable if you are getting large increase. I purchased some SOXL about 5 weeks ago and have about 15% return this far.

129,GOOGL," 99+% of my money is long term hold (mostly index funds so think lifetime holdings). For single stock long term holdings, I guess I have AMD, MSFT, GOOGL. I added BABA today for 'why not give a go' throwing some pocket change to it but basically all my money is in index funds EOD.

The rest < 1% of my money that I invest can be sometimes very short term. You know, day trading. Like sometimes, a second of holding and all. It's more for entertainment purposes. My returns from day trading the past half a year has been >>> my entire CAVG of my long term holds outside AMD (which I bought at a whim at the time when I had leftover cash).

But I also know my day trading is purely luck and that it could have just as well went the other way. After all, I day trade with the expectation to lose money. I don't really have a strategy and most day traders lose money so... who knows (shrugs).

SO MUCH THIS.

I dont have the means to just dump my money into some slow burning stock for a few years.   Right now, myself and thousands like me chasing meme stocks are ( for the most part ) fairly poor individuals trying to make enough for a core
To actually lt invest in.

Not like i am successful, have lost 1.5k in the last month ive been at it.  But have 5k tied up shares in amc and clne, and praying with the rest of us that we can make a little money to actually become investors, instead of gamblers.

That cash?  Thats all i have to spare.  I have a family and am the sole provider, with little energy to burn outside of work and the kids.

I NEED to be successful at this.  Day trading is a possible means to an end.  But not something id like to do long term.",NoEducation8251,-2,/r/investing/comments/o02yvt/how_many_people_on_this_forum_consider_themselves/h1tbvje/,0.073,0.822,0.104,0.6104
135,AMC," I have good scanners spot stocks regularily.  However, unless I am highly confident I do not do day trading anymore. These stocks you trade I have not traded. Sold AMC at $5 , $10 and stopped. Too speculative.

Now is inflation adjusted, retail, and high dividend stocks.  With opening up, consumer, construction, fashion, energy are going to prosper.  If one can get 6-8% dividend rtn from boring funds that appreciate over time I stay with them.",Vast_Cricket,1,/r/investing/comments/o02yvt/how_many_people_on_this_forum_consider_themselves/h1tgl0d/,0.053,0.79,0.158,0.8122

One thing which usually holds value in these cases would be real things like commodities-and oil is rising.   Gold/Silver have risen however seem to be vastly suppressed by Central Banks on actual price somehow.   Then again with the USA shut out of the Chinese market for retail investors, banks paying nothing on CD's, Bonds paying low rates and expensive, I stuck money into JP Morgan's Conservative Investment Fund which seems to cover everything from cash to stocks including foreign stocks and Munis to govt. bonds.   I also play some preferred stocks which pay much more than bonds for short term profits and like to buy before the dividend date and sell ahead before it drops.   If JP Morgan covering the entire spectrum of global investing in it's ""fund of funds"" can't make some money???  Well we might have a problem.   I see a ton of baloney companies out there and some with ridiculous PE's and had to sell a lot of bonds early this year when the Fed raised short term Treasury rates.   You don't want to get caught holding overpriced long term bonds when they pull that stuff.  I do hold a USAA short term bond fund and one Muni fund and am always looking for opportunities for short term trades here and there in whatever.

Long term I see energy as the key and interesting things down the road like South Korea and China working towards ammonia powered ships and ammonia production by Saudi Arabia and others as something which is interesting.    It would take huge investment to replace what they have in oil though.   Wood is being used by the UK to generate electrcity!!!  yup they chop down trees in the USA and Canada, pellitizing them and shipping them across the ocean at huge expense calling it ""Green"" and Biomass so they can plug in their Tesla etc.   That is interesting like the fact that the North Sea is in huge decline.   I see Russia and China gobbling up oil fields in Iraq through Iran and wonder if perhaps Maduro down in Venezuela isn't working for the CIA to hold their oil for use later by US majors.(just in case)  Saudi Arabia seems to be in some sort of decline like Kuwait etc. although QATAR and Iran seem all set with their huge natural gas reserves in the Gulf.

188,UBER," He's not betting on it splitting, that wouldn't matter. He's likely betting that it's considerably overvalued - he said that it could go down 90% without causing fallout to the financial system (https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-tesla-stock-price-decline-market-crash-2021-2-1030083091). I think if he's betting on inflation, he's also likely expecting considerable multiple contraction in very richly valued growth stories and to him Tesla seems to be the poster child for those kinds of Ark-y stories.

I wasn't interested when it IPO'd, still not.

I didn't look at the transaction details to figure it out but I'm sure that it's someplace on the SEC site.  I am making the assumption that the shareholders that voted for the merger last week didn't do so to lose 70% of their equity.  The details are probably in the transaction and any discount would have been arbitraged out by merger arb players.

I didn't do any of the math - but if the ADR really did lose that much value, it would certainly be interesting to find out why.

This is one of the times where I think that it's really stupid of companies to re-use ticker symbols.

Also - it looks like most market data sites do not yet have adjusted data.",greytoc,2,/r/investing/comments/o09v5f/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h1w9r0c/,0.059,0.828,0.113,0.7861

Double check on the fine print for language akin to ""required for a one time verification/acct linking or pw is not stored blah blah blah"" if it makes you feel better.

 Or, once linked, just change your bank acct pw.

227,IMO," Well.  There is a compelling argument to be made that the stay-at-home economy juiced up sales of durable goods.  That can’t go on forever, and eventually the consumer demand for these durable goods will drop, which I think is best illustrated by lumber.  People staying at home were bored and sat around looking at renovations and new houses and paint.

As the economy opens, this trend is bound to reverse and we’ll see a change to consumers favoring services.  Travel, restaurants, hospitality, games, tech services etc.  This back end of the recovery will not drive inflation like the front end because services are much more scalable than goods are so there’s not as much scarcity.

IMO the bottom is going to drop out on cyclicals (except for autos where there is long term underproduction), and we’re going to see a return to the big tech trade later in the year.  The last 6 months have been an almost unprecedented rotation into value, but I think we see that slowly unwind.
