2,RH," $SXTC is doing a 1:4 reverse split tonight. If you buy one share on RH today for $0.80, you'll have a fractional share after the split. They are rounding up fractional shares to full shares, which means you'll get one full share worth around $3.20 in your account after 3 days. Easiest $2.40 profit of your life.

The past few days a short trader, with a fairly small position has been able to manipulate the share price on low volume (due to the also low float).. from $7.50 into $5s.

But 1-2 week $10-11 PT is still the same, which offers a x2 opportunity.  Also, 2 month PT is still $20...... & End of Year PT: $75+ (with positive Phase 3 results).

Vanguard acquired just over a 12% stake in the last 2 weeks, and co-founders own over 55% of shares, which are locked up 12 months. So super low float now- as volume picks up and this becomes less under the radar... it will start jumpin ( $120M Market Cap currently).

Reminder that the management team has one of the best track records & most expertise in the Biotech World.  Here are truncated Bios of just 4 of the Co-Founders:

Raphael Mechoulam: Discovered the bodyâ€™s endocannabinoid system. Harvey Award 2020 winner for formulating Synthetic THC CBD analogs. (Potential 2021 Nobel nominee).

Dr James Woody: Discovered Remicade (J&J acquired for $5 Billion. Sales of $50B + since approval). Founded Avidia & Proteolix (sold to Amgen). CEO & Founder of Oncomed Pharma. President of Roche Bioscience.

Prof Sir Marc Feldman: Oxford. Discovered anti-TNF therapy- which Remicade, Humira etc are based on ($159B class by 2025). Lead clinical trial for drug Remicade (J&J acquired for $5 Billion). Lasker award winner (2nd only to Nobel).

Prof Lawrence Steinman: Stanford. Founder of Neurocrine Bio. Discovered role of integrins, Tysabri (Biogen acquired for $3 Billion).

And Most importantly for ATNF's likelihood of success- is that the Drug Trials they are targeting...are literally in the areas they pioneered and successfully took the 1st drug in class to market.  And their trials are chosen with a keen eye for FDA triggers: Lower Risk profiles, targeting conditions with unmet needs, and more specifically targeting therapies within existing large classes with better outcomes and much lower risk of side effects.",SCModerate,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/lnd8bd/daily_discussion_thread_february_19th_2021/go01e3u/,0.041,0.814,0.145,0.9907
