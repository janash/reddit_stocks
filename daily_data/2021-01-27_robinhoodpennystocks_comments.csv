By what we can see, AMC is the same case. By all accounts it should really not be going anywhere, especially as much as it has so likely its jut another WSB match.

1313,BB,You can not lose more than you put in any scenario. If you want to hold long term buying the stock outright is your best bet as you can not afford an option at that price. If you want to gamble that BB is going to go up in the short term your best bet would be to pick a. expiration date 2-3 weeks out and pretty far past the price the stock is currently at. A real life pick for your $300 as the price sits now would be an expiration date of February 19 for a strike price of $33 at a cost of $2.92 which would cost you $292 dollars. If the price goes up steadily you will see great gains but if it goes down or doesn‚Äôt move much up or down that price will slowly decrease down to $0 on February 19th if BB is not $33 or more.,0.008,0.895,0.098,0.8815
1314,BB,"I will be using real BB numbers as of 1/26 closing: BB Price: $20.15 and looking at a call thats no more than $300 at this time.
-------

Strike Price: $23, Expires: 2/5, Cost: $2.87 (2.87 x 100 = $287), .


$287 is the maximum amount of money you can lose, its unlikely that you lose all of the amount but possible if..... 1) You don't sell or exercise the call by the expiration date, in our case 2/5, and 2) If the stock falls wayyyy to low, like $5 or something, there are calculators online where you can find these number.


Between today and 2/5, you will make a profit if the stock price keeps rising approaching the strike price, it may be $2.87 today, but as the stock price rises so does the call. 



You can sell the call to someone else (just like how you bought it from someone) or exercise the call.



The sooner the Stock Price reaches the $23 the more profit you will make if you decide to sell the call, the inverse also applies. 


If you would like to exercise the call, it means that you will be buying the 100 shares at the strike price so you will need $23 x 100  ($2,300), but you can hold on to the shares for as long as you want, or sell them instantly (You would do the is the stock price is over $23 and the original contract money is covered) In our case here, you would need price to be $25.87 since you paid $287 to break even.",0.045,0.848,0.107,0.9612
1315,PLUS,"With options your potential loss is 100% if it expires out of the money; your potential gains are infinite as long as the stock goes above your break even price, which is your strike price PLUS the amount you paid for the contract.

What else do you need to know? On Thursday I bought 10 weeklies at 13c and 10 20c 6/8 expiration and it‚Äôs going well so far",0.053,0.885,0.062,0.1779
1316,BB,Curious how call options work. If say BB is like $100 a share by 2/5 and you of course buy option at $23 a share... Are you allowed to sell your shares on 2/5 to maximize the profit? Just curious in what way call options are different than limit option outside of having option to not buy and see how things go.,0.0,0.789,0.211,0.9081
1317,BB,"You can exercise and sell the same day, but what the heck is a limit option? 

A call option is buying the right (but not obligation) to purchase a share at a specified strike price by an agreed upon date in the future. In the example, the agreed upon price is $23, the date is 2/5, and you‚Äôd be paying $2.87 for that right. If BB goes to 100 on 2/5 and you exercise to sell immediately , you make 100-23-2.87 per share. 

If it goes to 100 tomorrow, you could just sell the contract for something around 77.",0.017,0.876,0.107,0.8462
1318,ACRX,"ATOS, yes, there are several catalysts over the year. Whatever your buy price, it'll get back there, just keep an eye on the day/hours before a catalyst.

ACRX is a similar story. Buy ratings with PTs from $5-$9; it'll get back up on hype and then whether it tanks or explodes will be based on the actual nature of news. Your best best is to lock in profits pre-announcement.

In biopharm, the only real long-term value holds is when there is FDA approval for release, and even then you're likely to see a dip between that announcement and the actual release window. Otherwise it's largely P&Ds around trial data releases.",0.0,0.838,0.162,0.9612
