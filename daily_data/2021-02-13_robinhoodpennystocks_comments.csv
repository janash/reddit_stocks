15,AGTC," Pump and dump is probably getting overused a fair bit but I think the general thing we‚Äôre trying to take away is that folks need to be more careful about buying stuff that‚Äôs already seen a lot of upswing as of late if they‚Äôre looking to make a slick short term play. Some things might continue to rise but it‚Äôs general best to find something at a good entry point so that leaving some of your investment to sit after that boom doesn‚Äôt become such an awful prospect. 

Between the BANG and weed debacles, I can‚Äôt blame folks for being so much wearier. When you find a stock like ZOM or AGTC that has rather consistent and stable performance after you buy it, it hurts that much more when you expect the same from the newest stock on the block and it craters right after.

17,DD," People need to stop buying stocks based on how many other people are saying rockets and do their own DD. Don't touch the shit if you don't feel like the price is justified. 

This is what happens these days. I find pretty stones. I really like the stones and think they should be worth $10 each. I write about how smooth and shiny the stones are, and how soothing their colours are.

People suddenly start talking about sending the stone to the moon and start a bidding war and pushes the price to $100. We start seeing pumpers and people who genuinely think that the stones are worth $100.

People suddenly realize that a stone is a stone, and the price crashes. Stone holders get salty and start blaming anyone who said anything positive about the stones for pumping the stones.

A time variable would be dope. For instance OBSV looks like an overlooked gem based on your graph, it hasn't been mentioned here in three weeks.

To less informed folk your chart might imply OBSV is a must buy (and I'll be clear, by 'less informed' I mean the wsb-type trader chasing gAiNz tO tHe mOoN).

Market cap, float, avg volume are some other ideas, and different sectors of industry have drastically different risk tolerances. The best looking companies on your graph are biopharmatech, super duper volatile.

1.  One of Joe Biden‚Äôs promises was tackling on the climate issue and he supports nuclear-powered clean energy and Bill Gate is a big supporter of nuclear energy. Not to mention, nuclear energy is favored by many countries so the demand will become greater in my opinion! 
2.  The Company's flagship project is the 90% owned Wheeler River Uranium Project, which is the largest undeveloped uranium project in the infrastructure rich eastern portion of the Athabasca Basin region of northern Saskatchewan.

On the 10th, they registered a direct offering which saw the stock decrease in price a bit. The direct offering closed today, meaning that we *could* see it climb back up next week. If you have it, I wouldn't sell at opening. The only big catalyst I see coming up is it gaining compliance with NASDAQ. That is, it has closed above $1 for I think 5 or 6 consecutive days now and needs to do so for 4 or 5 more (so, next Friday-ish). This probably will happen and could lead to the stock flying.

2. The Company's flagship project is the 90% owned Wheeler River Uranium Project, which is the largest undeveloped uranium project in the infrastructure rich eastern portion of the Athabasca Basin region of northern Saskatchewan.

176,DD," I am not experienced at writing DDs or reports but I would like to give you some constructive feedback on this. 

1. I think you need to be more organized. Break the DD down into sections based on questions you want to ask/answer. 

Example:
I. What are the basics of the company?
       A. Company name and Ticker
       B. Market Cap and Market Share
       C. Product or Service overview

2. Where is the company financially? How are it's fundamentals? How do these compare to competitors?

      A. Average Volume
      B. Dividend Yield
      C. Past splits or mergers
      D. Cash Flow, EPS, P/E, P/S, P/B
      E. Revenue Sources, Primary Customers, Expected Future Contracts/Customers
      F. Outstanding Debts, Contracts
      G. Legal status
      H. The Greeks

3. What is the company's market position? What is the future outlook? What strategies will it use to gain market share? Will it's proposed offerings create a new industry or market?

4. Who runs the company? What are their previous accomplishments and failures?

5. Your opinions for why the 4 sections are reasons to be bullish.

6. Your opinions for why the first 4 sections are reasons to be bearish.

179,GME," I think once the investigation into what happened with WSB and GME there will be a lot of arrests and a lot of people running far away from stocks.

I have zero doubts it was a conspired effort to pump and dump. Too many people claiming ‚Äúdiamond hands‚Äù ‚Äúhold strong‚Äù and pushing a false narrative that the stock would be worth thousands when there was absolutely nothing to back that up. We‚Äôre talking about a company that sells hard copies of games both new and used spiking when the industry is moving in the direction of digital download games and streaming.
They were telling people to keep buying more and hold hold hold and then suddenly started with the talks of ‚Äúfalse reports‚Äù and ‚Äúfake news‚Äù of the stock dropping when in reality it was dropping cause they were all selling as fast as possible to make millions while leaving the real, small level retail investors left holding the bag.

As far as the company, I‚Äôm usually in for the long hold with some but if it‚Äôs a get in, get out type situations, my % is around 10% to 20% return. That also depends on on how low the stock was and how many shares I bought though. 

Perfect example was yesterday. I bought SNGX at the dip yesterday for 2.08 @ 24 shares. It‚Äôs up to 2.60 AH. That‚Äôs a 25% increase in one day so I‚Äôll probably let it ride till late Wednesday before I sell.

262,CD," They are saying take out the shares equal to your initial investment + target gain. Make your money back (or take your 125+10% target ~137.50) and let the rest ride. It's a great way to achieve your goals and realize your plan and gains but also a great way to not miss out on any potential higher gains, should the price continue upwards. 

My account is much smaller than yours. But +10% is +10%. Standard bank savings accounts give you .3% interest. A 3 year CD gives you 1% if youre lucky.

276,DD," Fwiw sos is up about 100% from 2 days ago, dropped today from 7.70 AH to like 5.50 premarket and is back up to where it was. Reason for the drop was bc an offering was announced at around 1am est last night for 5 dollars. IMO the fact that it bounced back so quickly is a super good sign. It‚Äôs being compared to other cryptomining businesses like RIOT and MARA, both of which recently exploded in the past few months (up over 1000% each and seem to be continuing to make solid gains). From what I understand those two are based entirely on the mining aspect of crypto, whereas SOS had a foundation already established (up like 300% over the past three months). They only just received their crypto mining rigs this week which is why it‚Äôs exploding now and has a high PT similar to the other 2 companies I mentioned.

333,DD," Very new to this. On Tuesday I took out two calls at $1.5 strike on SNDL @.20 some SNDL@1.36 stocks, some EAST@1.87. Both started to go up that day, and I was going to sell for about 10% profit, but since I‚Äôm new to this, I didn‚Äôt realize I hit my PDT limit last week.
No factor - wait ‚Äòtil next day. And praise the stonk gods because SNDL exploded. Sold the calls @.95, SNDL shares at @2.36, and EAST@2.60. Didn‚Äôt look back.

Bought some GTE@0.99, ZOM@2.60, and sold next day at 1.35 and 2.76 respectively.

Bought MARA@36.89 and RIOT@46.20, and sold both next day for 38.16 and 46.80 respectively.

Finally on Friday my day trades cleared and I swung WUFU from 7.36 to 8.20.

My current strategy is to YOLO my way up with sub 10% trades, either during the day or overnight. 

Lessons learned:


-	Pay attention to PDT limits and use them wisely


-	Cheaper stocks with low trade volume are extremely volatile and the ticker can be very misleading. Stick to a sell limit and don‚Äôt look back when you make a profit. I‚Äôve seen people lose bad on the WUFU trade because they were getting hyped up by other people screaming about it going to the moon. Heck, I almost didn‚Äôt cut out in time and was saved by a momentary upswing.


-	Have strategy for overnight holds: bought MARA and RIOT during market dump, on same day as Elon‚Äôs Bitcoin news were announced. Took profits right as market opened because they met my % criteria. Didn‚Äôt look back.


-	You‚Äôll notice some of the stocks I bought were meme stocks. I did do some DD, but honestly thought that I got in early enough to ride the inevitable pump by few %.

Moving forward:


-	market is pumped and tanked twice last week. If cheaper ($10-50) stocks with strong support are tanking along everyone else, buy and hold overnight if capital is there. Cash out next day if they open higher.


-	with a YOLO strategy, have at least one day trade to mitigate risk


-	mentally prepare for the inevitable loss and work on detaching from watching the ticker and level 2 data, so that I can pull the trigger on selling at a loss",ExactFunctor,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lilwez/weekly_gainloss_porn_and_discussion_thread/gn91d68/,0.104,0.773,0.123,0.8713

356,GME," Reddit is not to blame. 

Robinhood is not to blame! 

Hedge funds, the system, the boogeyman aren‚Äôt to blame.

The only people complaint are the ones who played the game and lost. No one cheated anyone, no one tricked anyone. 

The only person you can blame is yourself. 

Jack gets money, jack loses all his money in GME. Jack is stupid and then Jack gets mad.

Jack sats he was tricked, treated, a victim of the system.

No, Jack was greedy and gambled.

There were 5-10 steps between Jack having $50,000 and Jack losing his $50,000 investing in GameStop.

1. Jack decided to invest his money.

2. Jack took his money out if a bank and sent it to Robinhood.

3. Jack then decided to click on the buttons and invest his money in something.

4. Jack chose to invest in GME.

5. Why?

6. The GameStop is closed in his town.

7. Jack is 60 years old and doesn‚Äôt have an XBox.

8. Jack watched the news.

9. Jack thought he was smart and wanted to prove how smart he was.

10. So Jack decided to invest his money in GameStop.

11.  So Jack invested.

12. That‚Äôs where Jack‚Äôs story turns sad.

13. Because Jack was stupid, but still greedy.

14. If Jack bought at the worst time, when GME was 420, he was destined to lose. 

15.  Assume he did buy at 420. 

16. Be didn‚Äôt sell at 409, 309, or 209,

17. Because Jack decided not to sell.

18. Or maybe because Robinhood, couldn‚Äôt process the orders fast enough, or needed to freeze accounts because of they had to find the money to cover the trades.

19. Well, sometimes the ambulance doesn‚Äôt get to a house fast enough and people die. Sometimes your plane is late and you miss the connection and a job interview. 

20. And sometimes, Jack makes a greedy stupid mistake that costs him $50,000. And wants to blame everyone but himself for his own decisions.

I don‚Äôt blame the gas station for the price of has I buy on Tuesday when the price is lower on Wednesday. And I don‚Äôt blame them when the pump is broken and I have to waste gas and pay a higher price down the road. 

I want to drive, I want gas. Jack wants to invest, Jack wants to invest in this stock.

Jack wanted to play in the game. Jack didn‚Äôt win.
