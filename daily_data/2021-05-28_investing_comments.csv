24,AMC," Meme stocks strategy

I got into AMC yesterday on the break above the highs from a couple months ago. Iâ€™m doing the same with a few other meme and high short-interest stocks which could see rapid gains in a short amount of time on the hype. I already made quick gains on JMIA, SPCE, and BYND. My strategy is always to have a stop loss Iâ€™m OK with, take partial profits on any jump up, and constantly raise stops as price appreciates. I also keep my position size small compared to my total portfolio. 

As a part of the general market I think the moves back to meme stocks is because people are frustrated where stocks are still bottoming and consolidating. The crypto correction has sent traders looking for wild gains elsewhere. This is causing rushes into smaller names wherever momentum starts to pick up and it means the moves could be short-lived. 

Markets get more and more wild as a top happens. Then it seems like just another dip when a decline has really begun. At this stage of the bull market while Iâ€™m being aggressive when the moment is right I will prioritize safety and honor my stops if things donâ€™t go as I hope.

30,AMC," Good morning contrarians!

Stock futures are higher this morning, with the Dow leading the way, up 0.5% S&P and Nasdaq are up 0.4%. Thatâ€™s as of 0630. This follows a day of gains for the Dow and S&P, while the Nasdaq was flat. The Russell 2000 rallied 1% yesterday.

Those gains donâ€™t tell the whole story however, as this week has seen a marked reversal in risk appetite. The Nasdaq is up 2% for the week, with the S&P up about 1%. Companies like Boeing, Ford, Roblox, AMC, and GameStop have seen dramatic rallies.

We have a couple of economic reports today that could shed more light on consumer spending and inflation. The Personal Income and consumer spending reports and PCE Core Price Index, the Fedâ€™s preferred gauge for inflation, are out at 0830. Expectations on the PCE are for a 2.9% year-over-year print for April.

We also have Chicago PMIs out at 0945. Last month saw a record (I think) 72.1 reading. Expectations for this month are for 68. Obviously both of these readings are well above the 50 level separating expansion from contraction.

Happy early Memorial Day! Forecasts are for a huge surge in travel this weekend. This means two things: 1) If you havenâ€™t left by now you will hit traffic. Put that in the books And 2) The pandemic appears to be well and truly over and reopening in full effect.

32,ANY," I have a question regarding ITM options vs buying the stock outright..   


I just purchased some PLTR stock and I plan to hold this for 8-10 years or more.  
I'm slowly adding to and increasing my position.  
I purchased around $1500 worth of the stock today @ 23.31, my other purchases were around $18-19/share.  
  
I understand options for the most part and I'm familiar with selling cash covered puts and selling covered calls, as well as the risk/reward of purchasing calls and puts. However... one thing I can't seem to grasp is ITM options. I think my brain goes haywire and I can't grasp it.. which brings me to my two questions;  
  
Since I intend to hold PLTR for the long term and don't mind the day to day or even month to month price fluctuations... would it make ANY sense to purchase lets say.. an ITM CALL that's going for $13.20 per contract with a strike price of $11 (expiring JUNE) VS purchasing the stock outright? With how I understand ITM options, I could purchase that ITM call expiring a few weeks from now, and exercise it immediately to own the 100 shares. and instead of paying $1500 for lets say 60 shares right now.  
Because if I purchase the ITM call and exercise the option, I'll have 100 shares for roughly $1320 vs purchasing the stock now for $1500 and getting only 60 shares. Am I getting this correct?  
  
And my final question... as far as SELLING ITM options, whether it's calls or puts, how does this work?  
If I own 100 shares of a stock that's trading at $20, I know I can sell 1 covered call contract expiring on whatever date with a strike price of my choosing (20.50, 21, 22, 25, etc...) BUT what happens if I change my strike price to be ITM, let's say $10? The premium I get is higher, but I need to understand what the catch is.

38,FRX," FRX, Beachbody, & MYX Fitness announced the three-way merger vote date. It is scheduled for 6/24/21 at 10AM. Beachbody is marketing themselves as the PTON for the masses. Here are my thoughts:

$PTON had $1.82B of revenue in 2020. It currently trades at a market cap of roughly 33B. $FRX / $BODY is on track for $1.1B in revenue this year and is being valued at roughly 3B after the merger is completed.... I think we have some upside here...

Pelotonâ€™s trailing 12 months revenue is currently at 3.692B. Again $FRX soon to be $BODY is on track to hit 1.1B this year. Thatâ€™s plenty of upside for the short term.Â 

Long term they are projected to hit 3.3B by 2025. With the integration of all parts of their business (Bikes, Supplements, Connected Fitness Subscriptions Services, OpenFit App, BODi, etc.) the value for each new customer acquired goes up. Plus, they will have a marketing war chest after the merger to achieve their growth target.

It is not a pyramid scheme. The Multi-Level Marketing part of the company is only one small aspect of Beachbody.

75,TSLA," Hello r/investing!

I recently was blessed to have won the lottery. After taxes I walked away with just over 2 million dollars. I've been investing relatively successfully for over a decade, but I would love to hear some ideas on how you folks would manage a 1 million dollar investment.

The goal would be to offset my yearly expenses which are around 100k. As I mentioned I've been investing for a long time and I tend to average between 15-20% annually, so the goal could be achieved through my current methods. But I'd love to hear your guys' ideas!

TSLA 35 days to expiration covered calls seem to be capable of racking up over 40k a month in premiums alone. But I've never been a big fan of putting all my eggs into one basket, so I'd likely do 200-300k worth of TSLA covered calls and the rest on traditional growth stocks. 

What would you do with the 1 million?",Hasteisthecase,1,/r/investing/comments/nmtkg5/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gzspf2o/,0.029,0.805,0.166,0.9758

78,UUUU," As you know it's a judgment call, and I don't know anything about UUUU, but I do long-term options trading pretty regularly and personally, I wait for 50% profit unless something starts to go horribly wrong. 

After selling a contract I set limit orders that expire the same day as the option to automatically buy to close when the contract price hits 50% of what I earned, and I set price alerts with my brokerage so that I get an alert if the stock price starts getting too close to the strike price for comfort. 

One thing that's helpful to know if you're writing puts - while of course you should always be prepared to be assigned - early assignment is not super likely very early in the contract period unless the company is very publicly going down in flames. There's no financial advantage to exercising in month 3 vs exercising in month 15, other than someone who desperately needs to sell off assets to raise cash - a possibility but not a high frequency one. I've held onto puts even when the stock price fell below my strike price because there was so much time left on the contract and the market buzz was more like ""this stock was becoming overvalued too quickly, but still has promising outlook post-price-correction"" vs ""this stock is poison,"" because I felt reasonably certain that early assignment was unlikely, and the price did recover before the end of the contract.",emikoala,2,/r/investing/comments/nmtkg5/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gzsbfbs/,0.084,0.787,0.129,0.9005

81,AI," My answer somewhat depends on whether you're just asking for markets that will post solid strong performance, or markets that are currently 1/100 of their potential size within the next few years and as a sector could outperform the market.

One of my favorite stocks in my portfolio is Waste Management ($WM). There are few things in life more certain than the fact that people are going to make a lot of garbage, continuously, for the foreseeable future. They even pay a dividend that's pretty respectable for a company that doesn't sell oil, gas, or pharmaceuticals (current yield is 1.64%). I keep a good chunk of my portfolio in $WM because I feel confident that it will go up, but not because I expect it to wildly outperform the market.

Self-driving cars are probably going to explode, making chips and AI and other related components a good bet. 5G is also likely to take off, and there are a bunch of infrastructure stocks related to that as well, ranging from companies that make 5G technology to realtors that lease their land holdings for 5G antennas.

Of course, the tricky thing with these sectors is there are a lot of players and not all of them are going to be winners. A few will end up being wildly successful and the others will be left behind, like Alta-Vista and Yahoo were left behind by Google. To best ensure that you end up with a Google in your holdings and not a portfolio full of Alta-Vista, you need to buy into a LOT of companies, or an industry-focused ETF.

PAWZ is a pet care industry ETF with good historical performance that I like. There's been a steady increase for years now in the amount of money people are willing to spend on their pets, from fancy expensive foods to luxury boarding to genetic testing and other advanced medical care that people never used to consider. If people remain prosperous that trend is likely to continue growing, but it's less of a sure thing - it could start seeing a steady decline if the economy sours, because indulging your pet is the kind of expense people cut back on when budgets get tight. That makes its future success uncertain, but I still think it has a limited risk of loss because any decline will be gradual - it won't tank overnight because people don't just stop spending money on their pets cold turkey.",emikoala,2,/r/investing/comments/nn152d/best_longterm_postpandemic_markets/gzs7adj/,0.041,0.78,0.179,0.9962

88,APR," Yes, this. Bonds and stocks have traditionally been bundled up together in target date funds precisely because investors flee to bonds when stocks crash, which drives up bond rates, and then they pile back into stocks as soon as they can offer a significantly better return than a T note. That inverse correlation is very strong and makes bonds a reliable downside limiter.

Of course, it's also a very lop-sided correlation, because stocks are much more volatile - when stocks go up a lot, bonds go down a little, but when stocks go down a lot, bonds go up a little. The more you limit your downside on bonds, the more exponentially you limit your upside on stocks. At this point in time, you'd be better served by putting your money in an ordinary online savings account with a branchless bank that can offer you 2-3% APR with a lot more liquidity.",emikoala,1,/r/investing/comments/nn3xmm/diversification_through_noncorellated_assets/gzspv41/,0.039,0.894,0.067,0.6245
