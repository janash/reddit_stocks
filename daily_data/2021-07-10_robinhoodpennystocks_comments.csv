0,AHT," AHT reverse split is 10-1. The supply after split will be like 22M. They will issue 46M new shares shortly after diluting you to 33%. They also said the split won't affect the current approved shares,  so they can issue up to 400m total. IMO sell now or bag hold for a decade, at least I got out already.",RazKaz-Na,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ohncx8/aht_is_the_reverse_split_bullish_or_bs/h4qihzi/,0.0,0.845,0.155,0.8271

2,ASRT, Look at what happened to ASRT.  No thanks,mweels1,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ohncx8/aht_is_the_reverse_split_bullish_or_bs/h4qftff/,0.198,0.541,0.261,0.1779
3,IVR," I canâ€™t grasp the 120,000 in iron condors on IVR. This is a sideways bet that the price will not move up or down and have low IV, right? 

These 120,000 contracts have 120,000 counterparty contracts so does that mean the counterparty options are bets that IV will rise and the price will not remain flat? It has to work that way, right?",fatonkad,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/oh6rc8/penny_stock_unusual_options_volume_79/h4ngkom/,0.042,0.958,0.0,-0.3899
4,IVR," It's actually not a bad play. It's only $24k risk with reward of $126k so a 1:5 rr. All they need is for it to expire between $3 and $4......IVR has been trending between $3 and $4 for 9 months...

The odds are there, and the RR is there. Solid play.",iGrits,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/oh6rc8/penny_stock_unusual_options_volume_79/h4o2pir/,0.11,0.746,0.145,0.4548
5,RH," How did you calculate the risk as less then $1 per contract?

Plugging the trade into RH gives a max loss of $7 per contract, or $210,000 ($7/contract x 30,000 contracts). This is still a pretty good r/r I'm just confused about your numbers.",Itsboomhomie,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/oh6rc8/penny_stock_unusual_options_volume_79/h4o392u/,0.137,0.738,0.125,0.1027
