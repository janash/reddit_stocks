0,USA," I’m just starting to read into etfs more as I decided individual companies were best based on my age and risk tolerance. But I feel that not investing in the rest of the world can leave money on the table as the world, more underdeveloped countries, begins to develop.

1,USA," ~~Unfortunately, VTI and VOO have similar returns from Sept 2010. Although past performance doesn't mean future performance, the similarities show that a lot of the global economy DEPENDS on the USA. When the top 500 fall, so does the global market. People will claim diversity is less risky but it's more transparent to just go with the S&P500.~~

~~However, things will change and the world economy will likely have another country that becomes a bigger force on the world. Maybe then I would invest the two economies rather than just the S&P500~~

Edit: thought VTI was VT.",MrMiao,-3,/r/investing/comments/nymmk3/voo_vs_vti_vs_vt_for_the_next_30_years/h1lfy9p/,0.013,0.972,0.015,0.0378
2,USA," Very well written. Now we need to ask ourself why we need diversification.

1. Cause we have period when USA outperform rest of world and we have period when rest of world out perform USA.
2. Having stocks in different countries means also diversification in currencies, and it's bet against risk of depreciation of USD
3. We live in uncertainty of trade wars, when China openly challenges dominance of USA. This itself means next 30 years will be much different than last 30 years.

When it comes to VT, it's not diversified enough to me. 

I look for options, where I can bet stronger on emerging countries with great potencial (Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan, Korea, India, Brazil). Believe heat and opportunities willl move to those countries, once trade war gets deeper.

I bet 40% on emerging market ex China

35% on S&P 500

25 % on Japan and Europe (small and middle cap) 

Stocks in those markets are cheap, especially in Japan, cause those places are in stagnation. Low demographics, poor reality of emigrantion. Not much international leverage of politics, being third player in global politics  This is reason stocks are cheap. Japan & Europe have greater correlation to USA stocks than emerging market. 25% should be enough 

I like my portfolio, and I do have small cap tilt too",Intrepid_Artist,1,/r/investing/comments/nymmk3/voo_vs_vti_vs_vt_for_the_next_30_years/h1m9se6/,0.073,0.843,0.084,0.1513

6,UK," Late reply, but I thought of your question for a bit.

VOO we know are US companies.

VT is more world, but still 57.7% US.
So I'll focus on the difference:

Japan 6.6% (declining population)
China 4.4% (China peak population 2025)
UK 4.1% (steady pop?, need immigration)
Canada 2.7% (
France Germany, Swutzerkabdm Aystrakua, Taiwan, Korea between 2.6% and 1.7%.
India 1.3%


UK Population: https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-impact-of-migration-on-uk-population-growth/

7,USA," Why diversification would be less rewarding? 

Unless you have time daily to read tone of books, articles, financial reports to pick up 10x business and hold it for next 30 years, there is no way to beat up market. Picking up stocks can become your job fast and you have huge opportunities cost of not doing something else

To be invested in markets around world give you very high profitability (around 90%) to achieve return around 7% within first 15 years already. Only betting on USA market, you higly increased risk, without much increased expected returns. 

Many investors will be burn, only invest in sp500. Last 30 years were extraordinary, will not repeat.

20,CHWY," Take 5% of your portfolio and buy what you want. That will get you exposure without making or breaking your long term. The likelihood you’ll out perform VT over a 10 year period is basically zero - it’s a statistical fact. Oh sure, maybe one of your picks will really take off — but then you’ll be punished when one goes bankrupt and you lose everything.  Ask the earlier shareholders of GM or other giants you’d assume are too big to fail, and have gone down. You might out perform for 5 years, only to be obliterated by some changing market trends.

That said, there’s some advantages to holding individual shares. There’s no fees for one. A second is you need to stay on top of what’s going on to manage even your small portfolio - although over 30 years it can get large. As an example, I’ve had Vz shares since the 80s (started as GTE). I won’t be selling unless I think the wireless business is threatened - seems doubtful.

As for your specific convictions, well meh.  Maybe FIGS and CHWY bc they’re small cap. But having lived thru the .com era and seeing the level of wreckage I’m not a fan of media or internet companies (remember AOL and MySpace?). It’s too easy for the incumbents to be unseated by an upstart. Sure, sure, we’ve settled on Google, Facebook, and Amazon currently — but there’s zero consumer loyalty when an option is a url away — and maybe after some antitrust action.

32,IP," Your conclusion might be true, but how you arrived at that position is awful.

First of all, you've subbed EA's entire sports IP's to Madden NFL, despite FIFA being a much bigger IP that has sold almost 1.5x the copies of Madden NFL. You've also forgotten about every other IP they own e.g. The Sims

Second of all, you're DD on the star wars thing is also wrong. Disney stopped  exclusive contracts, but there is nothing stopping EA from continuing to make Star Wars games bar Lucas Film licensing them. They will almost certainly publish JFO2 and maybe a new battlefront game.

I might be leaning HEAVILY into what you've written, but to me it also seems like you're basing your view entirely on EA's position as games developer, forgetting they also act as a publisher for 3rd party studios. 

You're also ignoring the mobile gaming business and origin.

Finally, you've also pinned EA's entire growth strategy on them releasing existing IP's. EA have grown for a long time by gobbling up smaller dev studio's. Sure they're a much more mature organisation now, but they still have deep pockets in an industry that is still growing, there's no reason to think they can't continue to grow through acquisitions.

EA is currently massively expanding cloud gaming, Origin for example will soon be replaced (something with Deskop in the name).

But I still believe that the price will dip in the coming days, because EA was ""stolen"" (actually copied) the source code for matchmaking in Fifa during the hack. There has always been the suspicion that there are algorithms in the matchmaking and the ""random""-algorithm of the player-card-packs, which try to pull as much money as possible out of the gamer's pocket.

The exclusive Star Wars deal with Disney will end in 2023, though they may still make deals with EA on a game-per-game basis.

I'd also say you should keep in mind that P/E is a snapshot of the trailing twelve months earnings. 

You should take into account the estimated future earnings too. There's a thing as the forward P/E ratio, which uses the next fiscal year forecasted earnings rather than trailing earnings. It's possible that a company might have had a year with unusually high operational expenses. It's possible that the company is growing and reinvesting a lot of money into their growth.

69,EA," I'm bullish on EA for understanding how they are percieved by the majority of the gaming community.

Quite frankly, EA is one of the most hated companies in the industry for their cheap money making tactics like putting gameplay interrupting ads in a paid game one month after launch and how sparse they are with content vs the price they ask for. It's a brand without any  loyalty and consumers have unlimited options to spend their money elsewhere.

Also, a lot of these big developers can't out compete small indie starups when, it comes to popularity. Games like Among Us, Undertale, 5 Nights at Freddy' s, and Minecraft & Fortnite (initially indies) generate more interest than Madden, Battlefront, and even the Sims.",junkpumpking,1,/r/investing/comments/nygiwr/electronic_arts_ea_over_valued/h1lqhlr/,0.089,0.825,0.086,-0.09

EA and TakeTwo are overvalued because their revenues the past year have been ballooned by huge increases in MTX sales. For FIFA and NBA 2K, MTX revenues have gone up by nearly 150%, but the studios lost revenues in other areas - for example they both released fewer games and make less money from straight up sales. Luckily, the pandemic had people happily spending more on MTX because they were stuck at home and only had the option to simulate sports - as sports were cancelled.

However, having a high market cap doesn't necessarily evaluate whether a company is good or bad -- because stock price can be artificially inflated (as with meme stocks) and 

For a complete picture, you should become familiar with reading an income statement and quarterly reports.

The most basic thing to know about any company is their earnings. How much actual revenue and profit (or loss) did they make in the last quarter? Are they trending positive or negative? How did their earnings per share (EPS) compare to the ""consensus estimate"" (i.e. analyst prediction. 

Some places to look are Yahoo Finance and MacroTrends.net

157,DCF," You need a method that's fairly simple and repeatable 
In terms of valuation others might suggest DCF or ratios but that's not the way to go in my opinion 

1) look at the balance sheet and try calculate replacement value or liquidation value  this should serve as your downside protection 
2) try and calulate epv value using greenwald method so look at last 5 years and try adjust for cyclicality repeating charges 
3) estimate a cost of capital this will depend on the quality of the enterprise 
4) if a company has some sort of moat/ competitive advantage try estimating growth rate as this is the only form of value creating growth 
Look at cash return, inflation ,organic growth 
5) as a sanity check  then look at a reverse DCF to see what growth rate the market is implying and see how your estimated growth rate compares 
6) don't forget about of balance sheet items 
7) try capitalise some of the sg and a,marketing and capex expenses 

If the a company has no moat by definition it should not be able to out earn it's asset value  in this case a company would be fairly valued 
If there is a moat it will have a higher epv value to asset value here growth assumptions become very important for investment descions 
If a company has a higher asset value than earnings value it probably has shitty management or there are some other circumstances surrounding it don't assume that this is undervalued without reason

160,DCF," As an FYI for readers, ""DCF"" is ""[Discounted cash flow model](https://financialmodelingprep.com/discounted-cash-flow)"" -- an analysis tool for ""fair value"" that will often (if not always) yield the wrong price direction, without other means to evaluate a company's performance.

Again, using $AAPL as a unicorn example, a DCF analysis would claim that it is ""overvalued"" (some [estimates being $117](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-aapl/apple/news/a-look-at-the-intrinsic-value-of-apple-inc-nasdaqaapl))

That's going to end up being erroneous, because it fails to take into real-world conditions and decisions, both in the broader economy (such as changing interest rates) and at the company (such as buybacks), that aren't reflected in its historic data.

In short, DCF is a high-falutin, overly elaborate formula to come up with a ""value guess"" -- which you can likely make as successfully by flipping a coin.

161,AZN," Pharma is even harder -- because every (non-generic) drug company is making *different* pharmaceuticals, with entirely different patent/research/costs. They don't directly compete against each other, except at the periphery.

The PE ratios are all over the place, as with tech.

For example (based on Macrotrends data, which may be +/- a few points):

* GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is at 14.71 P/E currently
* Novartis (NVS): 16.18
* Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): 19.83
* Pfizer (PFE): 20.48
* Merck (MRK): 27.63
* Eli Lilly (LLY): 33.50
* AstraZeneca (AZN): 38.66

Is AZN somehow better than those others and deserving of a ""higher ratio""? Uh, no. It's based on market perceptions, oftentimes disconnected from anything else, regardless of underlying fundamentals.

Obviously small-cap pharma/biotech can be wildly different because the differences between two ‘one-product companies’ can be massive.

Academics like Burton Malkiel, who wrote A Random Walk Down Wall Street, have done all sorts of analysis using various investment methods have confirmed this. Beating the market can be done, but isn't easy and seems to be as much art and luck as it is science due to qualitative factors that haven't been quantified or studied yet. The best qualitative analysis books, IMO, were written by Peter Lynch and Phil Fisher. In Lynch's book, he talked about how getting big returns in the fund he ran became harder due to scale. For example, it is easier to put a large portion of your portfolio into small up and coming companies with 100K than it is 10B. So getting a bigger RoR is easier with smaller amounts.

Another problem is people like Lynch and Fisher would physically meet with senior management, employees, and personally use their products to get a feel for it.

Interactive Brokers will for sure accept Australian customers and you'll be able to keep your account if you were to move back to the US (or anywhere else for that matter) at some point. Also Etrade accepts customers from certain foreign countries (not all though).",fruit_loops_jabroni,1,/r/investing/comments/nykvsc/us_expat_living_in_australia_can_i_trade_using_us/h1lmvis/,0.0,0.892,0.108,0.8779

Is it worth the cost? Probably the best way to evaluate the ROI of a subscription is based on whether you realistically expect to read often, the size of your portfolio, and the breadth of your portfolio.

If you don't read much, only invest a little, and focus on a handful of companies, then virtually no subscription is worth the cost.

However, if you fit at least any two of these criteria, then SA is one of the most cost-effective places to help you consistently improve investment returns.",CranberryReign,2,/r/investing/comments/nyz86q/is_seeking_alpha_premium_worth_it/h1n63fd/,0.046,0.777,0.177,0.9632
