He's really coming out of all of this as a man of the people; however you slice it Chamath is great at marketing, which is shown even more evidently through his SPAC promotions.

In addition to that, he recognizes the game switching towards organized capital (i.e Hedge Funds) vs. disorganized, loosely affiliated capital (i.e. WSB, and investing subreddits as individual communities) [Quote from Chamath, from CNBC interview](https://youtu.be/m1T8dT0xySM?t=131). Especially now that the communities are overlapping with other Social Media platforms, you see TikTok & Twitter stock pickers getting some their information from Reddit (indirectly or directly), and this drives even more speculative trades based on what SM 'analysts' are pushing that day/week/month. It's important to use investing/finance related subreddits as a tool in your goal towards pursuing gains, instead of blindly following; although blindly following WSB advice seems to be working thus far.

After seeing my brother playing Madden via Game Pass, on his cell phone with a joystick attached to his phone was incredible, I think Cloud gaming is the future no question,

A. Better for consumers - can access a massive library of games with a flat fee, similar to what Netflix did for TV.

B. Better for Microsoft - moves to a subscription model versus hardware cycles which is likely more profitable in the long run, and an area where they regularly get beaten by Sony and Nintendo.

C. Better for game developers. The same way shows got a ""second wind"" by appearing on Netflix, like The Office, Breaking bad, Mad Men, etc - I believe will occur with classic games as well, and could bring attention to a studio that might not be top of mind.

In addition, it gives developers more options to monetize their game as they can sell the streaming rights to a streaming giant like Microsoft.",0.077,0.792,0.131,0.8021

If anyone remembers, back in the day (and still in the present), OTC bulletin boards for discussing penny stocks were...the wild west. You'd see all kinds of securities frauds and schemes going on. 

Of course, the people frequenting those places, all knew. They were either in on it, or just observing the spectacle. But these boards were not *huge* - big enough to move shitty penny stocks, and just big enough to land the securities on the regulatory radar. 

Now - take the above, add in the ease of modern investing, and multiply the audience with thousands to tens of thousands - and you have a perfect recipe for some regulatory sh!tstorm. And on top of that, you have social media influencers with TENS of millions of followers that amplify whatever comes out of WSB. 

I tend to be optimistic - but this is obviously going to be too much. 

And remember - with every pump and dump cycle, there are going to be those holding the bags. That's also extra fodder for more scrutiny and regulations. If not out of the GME spectacle, some in the future. 

With GME, it's easy to be sympathetic, because you're reading about the elite short-sellers that's biting the dust. But what when it's some unsuspecting company that has few (if any) traders shorting them, and ""innocent"" regular Joe's get caught up in the pump?

So money that all the loans are made in be it [what US owes China](https://youtu.be/Ck3FuTzZvhI) or what Argentina owes the US/IMF/EU/China/etc. US will NEVER be unable to pay any debt made in USD because it can just print that amount. The reason why Argentina keeps going to hyperinflation is because they print more money to pay debts owed in foreign currency and their own currency devalues.

* Having the world currency also means it's the safe money that the people run to when shit hits the fan. Last April: Gold dipped. FAANG dipped. A lot of foreign currency dipped. Bitcoin dipped. But if everything fucking dips then what's going up? US DOLLAR 

* Having USD means USA could print near infinitely to bail out American companies come recession or instability. It's happen multiple times now.

* And when shit hits the fan and other currencies deflate when their governments print too. Then the USD goes up against them. You would want USD and you who makes the most American dollars? American companies with exposure to Americans. 

* American power and soft influence a board. Label China a currency manipulator? CNY and Chinese stocks are going to move. Sign a free trade with UK? Those stocks going up. Invades some middle east countries? Oil up. Wants a green new deal? ICLN rockets.

p.s. One of my hugest concerns is that lot of American power has been eroded since Orangeman took office.

Porsche was buying up Volkswagen but Short Sellers were shorting it because Volkswagen stock probably wasn't worth what Porsche was paying for it, especially as the price increased due to Porsche buying up the company. On 26 Oct, to the Short Sellers' surprise, Porsche announced that it had bought enough options to purchase 31.5 percent of the stock, this would reduce the public float to just 1%, when 12.8% of the stock was shorted. The next two days the stock price skyrocketed as Short Sellers covered and the price fell afterwards.   


**My Guess**

My guess is that Porsche decided to buy massive amounts of Options instead of buying shares which would drive the price up, so short sellers were successful in pushing the price down until the trading day after Porsche's announcement.

Personally I wouldn't advocate for it, GME is a shitshow that shouldn't have happened but that blame doesn't lie on the retail investor.  The causality here was still too much short interest on such a tiny float.  

The broader commentary surrounding the squeeze is what fascinates me, there's so much of the internet that is treating this like some sort of retribution or uprising when in reality it's just a particularly hilarious short squeeze.  Short squeezes aren't new or anything, and there's certainly a shit ton of institutional money on the long end of this one(you can tell by the volume and orders).  

But I think you misread the author if you think there's blame being applied, they're not laying blame.  They're saying this whole rhetoric surrounding it, the rage being expressed, and the hatefulness that's coming from the retail investors towards what they perceive as ""wall street"" is both unfounded and really quite misguided.",0.154,0.751,0.095,-0.9134

They (WSB) are able to see the short interest.  This morning Melvin said he closed his position. They (WSB) saw short interest unchanged so they assumed Melvin lied.  

Melvin never said he closed out his short.  He closed out his position.  You can do that with other products, such as derivatives, options, TRS, etc.  so he still has a short, but now he has a different type long to offset the risk.",0.077,0.874,0.049,-0.3331
307,TRS,"> Melvin never said he closed out his short. He closed out his position. You can do that with other products, such as derivatives, options, TRS, etc. **so he still has a short**,

This isn't necessarily true at all.

I have noticed over time that there are a number of retail traders that fancy themselves experts and yet don't understand the definition and context of ""short"" in professional finance.  

When I say ""I'm short XYZ"" I mean ""I have initiated a position that is profitable should XYZ decline in price"".  This can be literally short selling, as in borrowing stock, selling it, etc.  Or it can be through derivatives such as puts or whatever.  Since derivatives both allow for additional leverage and a much more fine tuned risk exposure they're far more common. 

But, for whatever reason retail investors hear ""I'm short XYZ"" to mean ""I borrowed XYZ stock, sold it, and am intending to re-purchase later"".

I don't know what Melvin's portfolio looks like, or what exactly the context of their comments were, and I largely don't care about them.  But I have on several occasions had absolute noobs get in rage fits arguing with me for pointing out that when people in finance say they're ""short"" a security or they have a ""short position"" this in no way denotes that they are definitely short selling.  In fact I'd go so far as to say my initial assumption when I hear that is someone initiated a derivatives based short position.

This is just one of the many huge disconnects I see between places like reddit and what is actually happening in the real world, and I think it helps these noobs create a whole chain of silly assumptions then get in a rage fit over what basically amounts to them not understanding what a word means.",0.062,0.846,0.092,0.6333

Reaching 1 year LTCG on my 24 individual stock positions. Which ones would you keep, and which ones would you sell?

I built a portfolio of WFH stocks in April 2020, focusing on cloud computing and things I thought would do well during the pandemic. I've made a nice return (total basket of stocks is at over 50% return). After 1 year of holding for LTCG, I am looking to liquidate my positions and put profits into my buy and hold index funds.

I am considering selling all but FSLY, NET, ZS, CRWD, VERI, which are my 1-2 bagger stocks, and seem like companies of the future. But I'm not sure.

The bottom five in the portfolio are EVBG, INTC, VMW, IBM, SPLK, which are mostly in the red and some are single digit returns. BOX is not far ahead, at only a 15% return.

Why is Friday the magic day, and $1,000 the magic number? I've heard stuff about how Melvin Capital's calls expire at that time, so I'm reading about it online and I guess I'm just not understanding how it works. A call option is basically a deal where you get to purchase a stock at a certain price at any time until it expires, right? And if it expires on Friday, that means that short sellers will have to buy it at whatever the price is at that time. But if that's all true, why wouldn't short sellers start buying it at their call option price right now? Or am I just not understanding how this works at all?  


And if the call option does expire then and I am understanding this stuff right, then why even sell on Friday? If they haven't covered by then, wouldn't it be better for everyone to just keep holding on to their shares forever until the squeeze pops since they have to buy it no matter the price?

I live in the United States and plan to put $5,000-10,000 into the market, but I'll surely do as much research as possible (knowing that I can still lose all of it). I figure some stocks would be held for months, some longer, and maybe some much shorter. That being said, day trading doesn't sound like my cup of tea.

I am currently employed and do not need the $5-10K for rent or expenses or anything of the sort. It will be a learning experience, and I'm also not expecting to make large profits (if any).

I don't know where to start regarding which platform to use. I have heard wonderful things about TD Ameritrade, Schwab, Fidelity, etc. Friends and relatives have nothing but good things to say about Webull and Robinhood, though I've heard many not-so-great things about the latter.

I would obviously prefer to not deal with fees, or at least as few as possible. I am still not sure if the current plan is to just play around with stocks, or if I may find myself becoming interested in options or other possibilities. Being able to dabble in cryptocurrencies would be neat as well, but I don't see that as being a must-have.

&#x200B;

How can you have shorts for 127% of floating shares? Shorting means you loan a stock, sell it, hope the price goes down to buy it back cheaper and then close the loan by giving it back. So where did the broker get 127% of stock available for public trading? That means they bought some restricted stock (which as I understand is mainly owned by the corporation, and is reserved to be transferred to employees if they become vested, meaning achieved a certain amount of years at the company) .

Also, this whole short squeeze mess is only a problem as long as the broker wants to margin call the hedge funds. If they renegotiate to have unlimited margin at the broker then the short squeeze stops and paradoxically the hedge funds can now buy stocks for a 'normal' price and close their short position. If the short position of the hedge fund is big enough to bankrupt them, they have nothing to lose by not covering their short in the short squeeze. They can hold the broker hostage and demand a change of contract this way. Because if the broker is not nice to them this'll be the last deal they do with the broker, whereas if the broker lets them survive, in the end, this can be the better deal for the broker.",0.066,0.858,0.076,0.4188

It could expand the ATM offering to sell many more shares. This would give it more capital without as much dilution which it could use for something. Maybe like a revamp of their business to more digital stuff, reflected in their recent additions of former Chewy CEO and their board. Maybe something else. Maybe additional capital is not really needed and would only be wasted.

In September 2020 the name of company showed up in the Polish Short Sale Registry (Rejestr Krótkiej Sprzedaży) because of a short position in game developers CD Projekt, a net position of 0.55 percent through the Polish stock exchange (GPW).[10][11] They gained considerably due to the problems faced during the launch of Cyberpunk 2077.

After the recent minor patch the game is very playable, before I personally had one crash on XBOX. It just was a good story to jump on to for the media and everybody else that the game is not good. In reality it only has its problem on last generation consoles and the latest patch is a good start. 

Really why do people wait to buy, and buy GOTY Editions, it’s because this is pretty standard and I remember that in Witcher 3 Novigrad was a no go zone because of crashes for a long time.

Valve CEO said it was brilliant.

The lawsuits, if you understand them they would have to successfully make the case that 7CD knew this would happen. But otherwise they would have lost the Christmas sales, and would have gotten into trouble for that.

In March the Stock pays dividends from the sales it seems.

534,CEO,"Melvin shorted CD Project Red at launch. From Wikipedia:

In September 2020 the name of company showed up in the Polish Short Sale Registry (Rejestr Krótkiej Sprzedaży) because of a short position in game developers CD Projekt, a net position of 0.55 percent through the Polish stock exchange (GPW).[10][11] They gained considerably due to the problems faced during the launch of Cyberpunk 2077.

After the recent minor patch the game is very playable, before I personally had one crash on XBOX. It just was a good story to jump on to for the media and everybody else that the game is not good. In reality it only has its problem on last generation consoles and the latest patch is a good start. 

Really why do people wait to buy, and buy GOTY Editions, it’s because this is pretty standard and I remember that in Witcher 3 Novigrad was a no go zone because of crashes for a long time.

Valve CEO said it was brilliant.

The lawsuits, if you understand them they would have to successfully make the case that 7CD knew this would happen. But otherwise they would have lost the Christmas sales, and would have gotten into trouble for that.

In March the Stock pays dividends from the sales it seems.

541,ABC,"Your answers are here: https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/trading/avoiding-cash-trading-violations

The example they give seems to align with your situation:

“Good faith violation example, Marty:

Cash available to trade = $0.00

On Monday morning, Marty sells XYZ stock and nets $10,000 in cash account proceeds

On Monday afternoon, he buys ABC stock for $10,000

If Marty sells ABC stock prior to Wednesday (the settlement date of the XYZ sale), the transaction would be deemed a good faith violation because ABC stock was sold before the account had sufficient funds to fully pay for the purchase.”

As for whether Fidelity will let you - technically yes but with a 3-strike rule:

“Consequences: If you incur 3 good faith violations in a 12-month period in a cash account, your brokerage firm will restrict your account. This means you will only be able to buy securities if you have sufficient settled cash in the account prior to placing a trade. This restriction will be effective for 90 calendar days.”",0.086,0.789,0.125,0.7908
