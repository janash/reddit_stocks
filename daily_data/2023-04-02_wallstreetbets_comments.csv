38,AI," Here's how to think about stocks/american companies.

American companies are extremely good at generating new ideas and creating more value from the inputs (labor, machines, natural resources). These new ideas diffuse pretty quickly at top firms. Sure, it looks slow/beauracratic on a day-to-day basis. If you zoom out, we are really good.

American company revenues are also spread all over the world. So, every 2-3% world GDP growth, American companies increase their earnings to 8-10%. 

Tools like chatGPT and AI are more quickly adapted at American firms than European or Indian firms. Short term, sure fear mongering will take over. 

But S&P 500 at today's levels are incredibly cheap from the value that they will create in the next 10-20 years.

93,TSLA," Options can be used for gambling, but that’s not their main purpose. Their main purpose is insurance. Some funds might be required to buy puts to insure their portfolio. Assume you have a portfolio of 4 million, invested in SPY. You could buy 100 puts at 300 to limit your potential losses to 25%. This insurance costs some premium, around 1.3% of your account per year, but you might feel better that if shit hits the fan, you’re not losing more than 25%.

Now you think it is very unlikely it will go down 25%. Then you can simply write that option, sell the insurance to that buyer. You will then collect the premium, and when the option expires worthless, keep it. If it does drop more than 25% though, you have to cover the losses beyond that.

Some of these premiums may be too high, some may be too low. On more volatile assets, take TSLA as an example, insurance for 25%+ costs around 12%. That’s 12% for you if you don’t think it will drop 25%+ in a year and you sell that insurance. If it drops 50%, you lose 13%, of course.

If you think the premium is too high, you win by selling options if you’re right. If you think it’s too low, you make money by buying options if you are right.

If the premium is too high and you gamble by buying options, you are losing money on average.

Since some funds and other entities are required to buy insurance on their assets, they might be willing to pay a little bit extra on the premium, which gives puts a tendency to be a bit overpriced most of the time - but not always. This makes selling options often more profitable than buying options.

66% of all passenger vehicles in germany are parked on the street. No garage, no driveway.

That's why currently and in the forseeable future,  85% of all BEV charging is and will be  done at private chargers.

While germans only drive about half the distance americans do, so on avg. 40km/day, this still means you got to charge your average car once a week.

118,VERY," FYI: as a reference, Argentina looks like it doubled it's gold reserves, yet:
- their inflation is over 100%
- half of the country is very...VERY poor
- Middle class is less than 17% of the population (earning between U$D800-1.000)
- Rich people (ABC1 qualified by rating of income, less than 5%) earn U$D1.500 or more.
- they are printing money like crazy. The biggest bill worth less than U$D4. You can't even pay a Macdonald's meal with one of them",unc0m0n-name,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/129mm2u/change_of_central_banks_gold_reserves_20002023/jeoeo05/,0.064,0.769,0.167,0.7801

124,SQ, Im basing it on how the stock performed in the last year. It's a trend that this stock goes up for 2 weeks then dives hard in the next week. SQ had been going up for little over a week and now its pivoting downwards on a friday when that friday was a bull run with nasdaq going up 1.74%. Typically when the nasdaq has such a good green day is when the probability of nasdaq going down becomes much higher.

200,AI," It's overrated. 

Don't get me wrong it will still change things. But ultimately it's still a tool however advanced and tools get things wrong. People are acting like they can use it to do anything with 100% trust. It's results still need verified, corrected and adapted. 

Essentially it will replace first line workers but nothing higher. And it's not going to make computer software itself it's going to allow software developers to make software faster.

AI isn't a chef it's the guy in the back peeling potatoes.

So it will definitely hit some jobs. However, you have an employment problem now not an unemployment one. Last I checked there were just under 2 jobs available for every one person looking for one. Even after tech layoffs. 

As things stand now AI could take over half the US jobs and there would still be enough jobs for everyone. Though unskilled people are going to have to get some skills to fill them. Although ironically we will still need people peeling potatoes. Your job at Wendy's is probably safe. 

Higher productivity and output with the same number of people employed means higher supply with similar demand.

202,AI," What a nuanced bitch:

The impact of AI on inflation or deflation is not straightforward and may depend on various factors such as the industry, market, and economic conditions. However, some possible scenarios can be considered:

Deflationary: AI can lead to productivity gains and cost savings in various industries by automating repetitive tasks, reducing labor costs, and improving efficiency. This could lead to a decrease in the prices of goods and services, which could result in deflation.
Inflationary: AI can also create new markets and increase demand for certain products and services, leading to higher prices. Additionally, if AI reduces the need for human labor in certain industries, it may lead to higher wages for skilled workers who are in demand, which could lead to inflation.
Neutral: The impact of AI on inflation or deflation could be negligible if the productivity gains are offset by other factors such as changes in demand or supply, government policies, or global economic conditions.
Overall, it is difficult to predict the exact impact of AI on inflation or deflation as it depends on various factors and may differ in different industries and markets.",Cute_Plankton_6989,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/129820w/not_that_any_of_our_opinion_matters_but_you_all/jemf3eg/,0.063,0.846,0.091,0.7096
