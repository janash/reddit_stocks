20,HUGE," Having run and/or worked in a warehouse store for \~10 years you have to remember that they sell many things for a loss (staple items like bread and milk) to get people in to hopefully buy the stuff with good profit margins. How well that business model holds post pandemic will remain to be seen.. but if you think their profit comes from membership sales your wrong.. those are how they sell so many items at loss without going under. That being Said Costco would be #1 on my list if I had to choose a warehouse store to invest in. Sam's club even being backed by the HUGE resources of wal-mart has shown time and time again that it ends up following costco in making changes rather than making it's own market leading changes. Not to mention Costco is still well ahead of the game in the number of it's own private brand products.

That being said the faster and better these retailers pivot to same day pick up and online options the better they are going to fair in the future. Can't speak for costco but wal-mart/Sams is having growing pains in this area. Making specific positions to fill orders only to months later announce much of it to be automated. If Sam's would drop its tire centers like they are doing many of their tobacco areas it would be a huge gain since for a multitude of reasons that specific area tends to be a if not THE major loss in stores come every audit.

Now having said that.. Sam's has a record of ignoring my advice to the point of me watching a 24 yr old manager let 600k worth of food spoil because they hire managers fresh out of college with 0 experience in retail or food so. I haven't had access to the numbers since I was ""displaced"" in december but i'm willing to bet my local store isn't doing so hot.",Fistalis,1,/r/stocks/comments/lvtb61/costco_stock_is_an_easy_buy_on_the_dip_cost_stock/gpeovet/,0.049,0.81,0.142,0.9827

24,UPS," Costco is one of the only big brick-and-mortar retailers that I'd feel comfortable investing in long-term. The goodwill they generate from their customer base can almost border on cult-like (similar to Apple, although I've noticed less of that in the past few years since Jobs passed away). I'd pretty much count myself in that group, as I absolutely love shopping there and the entire customer service experience.

I'll give you one brief example -- I purchased an Xbox Elite 2 controller from their website (on sale for $160, but still a lot of money for a video game accessory!). One of the buttons stopped working right around 4 months in. I Googled it and learned that it was a known issue with the controllers that seemed to impact many customers, but when I contacted Xbox, they told me the warranty was only for 90 days and sent me a link to the Microsoft Store where I could conveniently spend $180 to purchase a replacement. Yeah, that's a great way to treat your customers! (BTW, due to so many issues and complaints and I believe the possibility of a class action lawsuit, Microsoft recently extended the warranties to 1 year.)

I immediately hopped on Costco's website, chatted with a rep, and within minutes I had a new controller overnighted to me at no cost. I packed the old one up, sent it back, and they even gave me the digital mailing label so all I had to do was drop it off at UPS.

Their customer service is second to none for a retailer. They're smart about it. They'd rather take a financial hit on a return and turn that into a positive word of mouth story than risk souring a customer. All those good experiences compound quite quickly and that's why their member base has no problem paying $60 or whatever it is per year, and are so fanatical about the store.",paulrudder,1,/r/stocks/comments/lvtb61/costco_stock_is_an_easy_buy_on_the_dip_cost_stock/gpf7jcy/,0.068,0.836,0.096,0.9038

43,CEO," If your going to be in a warehouse retail enviroment Costco is the holy grail of jobs.. Even with years supervising various areas/fork lift certification and 6+ years of overnights at sams club under my belt the competition for a job at costco makes it hard to get in. They offer the same benefits as Sams's did (employee stock buy in/401k/health etc) but with a better work environment and far better employee track record. Sam's big issue is it's tendency to prefer to hire fresh out of college managers rather than promote someone who has been working for the company and knows policy better than the CEO. By the time I left the only one who knew half as much as me about policy and running the place was the new Club manager who was previously a regional and the very few long timers with 20+ years under their belt that were looking toward retirement very soon so had no interest in moving up. All  the managers were learning on the job because they don't teach the important stuff about running a large warehouse store in college. Wasn't always like that.. but they did a purge of the long time managers a few years ago and it definitely shows. They basically got rid of the long timers because they were making ""too much"" and replaced them with fresh out of college kids they could pay half and work twice as much.

It has online deals, too, so I start throwing in other impulses. They’re doing a good job of getting my money. Target is also doing a great job of diverting my business from Amazon and Walmart with their new systems. I wouldn’t go back to in-store shopping even if I could.

You're buying into the same industry, same sector, same country, and there are dozens of other companies to choose from. Which one is 'opposite' from GM? 

The opposite of day trading isn't making 'opposite' stock picks from what you think you should. The opposite is working for income and investing your money long-term. Assuming you diversify in wide indexes, good companies, and/or lower risk, non-equity investments, I'd say that in the long term a 99% chance of making money is quite feasible.

There's a correction on a day they're not ready for, they get behind, and they get shook.  Since they've lost capital, they aren't seeing the returns on their trades/swings, and that adds stress.  The additional stress leads to impulsive behavior, trying to catch back up, and one or two mistimed plays later they just aren't in a place to sustainably continue.

Doesn't mean they were altogether wrong from the start and needed to inverse themselves, but there's a world of difference bewteen being able to sit and wait through bad times, and having to somehow pull gains out your ass to keep the lights on.

83,AMC," Im new to this. Ive put in 300 dollars. Though my dollars seem to drop day to day... today it was -50 dollars so its like 250 dollars in investments... but in a sense Ive only lost money if one of two things happened.

2 - Place I invest no longer exists. I believe there are examples of this.

The only high risk im investing is AMC, I do see covid being a major factor, I dont see the place becoming an A&P store. And even so my 18 shares wont break me.

So there is a psychological issue I noticed with watching the up and down line.

84,MSFT," TLDR : Stop losses cut the trade. Many times, after hitting the stop loss, the stock will move back in the correct direction. No matter what position is taken (short or long) it is very difficult to accurately enter a trade, hit the target before hitting stop loss. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I day trade - not very successful - just enough success to cover my losses :P 
&nbsp;

The problem with doing the ""opposite"", with the strategy I use, is this : 
1. The stocks I pick for day trading are large caps - e.g. - Apple, MSFT etc.
&nbsp;

2. If you consider an up trending day, then the obvious position to take is a long position for the day.
&nbsp;

3. On a typical day, a stock price is range bound - for example between $100-$101. 
&nbsp;

4. Typically, I would start building a long position when the price is near $100.2 and set a stop loss at $99.6 and target at $101. 
&nbsp;

5. Probabilistically, the long position on a large cap on a up trending day, is correct.  The problem really occurs when the price momentarily  (spike) drops to 99.6 and hits the stop loss (kills the trade).
&nbsp;

6. Later in the day, of course the stock moves back to the target price. 
&nbsp;

7. It takes a long time to enter trades correctly and avoid stop loss. The basics of trading really do work over time - e.g. - always take positions with the trend (of the stock and the index). Always enter high probability trades (as per whatever trade indicators you use).

87,RH," I am new. 

There is a huge learning curve to understand the charts, graphs, and more. I am learning what a margin is, what a call, put, and more are and what each one does, and why. It's a lot like learning craps and when to bet the 6 and 8. It takes time to see the chart, and understand the best play. 

Now, after analyizng Robinhood and the fact that I can only day trade 3x a week, it would seem to me that I can buy and sell in a short term for a short gain. So the question then is this: How often, when a stock is on the rise for X period, if I buy in that it will still go up? Well the more time passes, the more likely the stock will switch direction. So if I buy X stock for 20 minutes or less, on the rise, can I set this up to maximize a $300 'win' 3x a week? (ex: Buy in for $10k and hope for a 3% gain and then cash out) Yes, I will have losing days, but this is a casino, so if I win 2 out of 3, I am still winning. 

I have zero clue where shorting is even located on RH. Without anyone standing over my shoulder teaching me, I have no idea even how to use the app to it's fullest potential.

96,GME," In my mind, I handle my stock buying emotions with the belief that as soon as you spend that money on a stock, you've lost it all, and you're paying for the experience to learn (which is why you should start with a very small amount).  That way you're never upset when you lose money because (in your mind) that money is no longer yours. At that point, any dollar amount that is left when you decide to sell is a win (by way of experience, money, or both).

115,BB," BB have great product, great working partners, great forward looking plan, and even nominated with best cyber security product award.

Now, lets sit down with a clear mindset.

Everything that is worthy seems to have been set in place, but why BB still seems pretty bearist? My opinion are:

1. QNX is not as profitable as what everyone thing. Yes, the adoption rate is really higher with more than 70% of the market is using it, but why is the revenue not justifying such adoption rate? Can you imagine 70% of the world using Windows Operating System but Microsoft is not profitable from the sales? Something is obviously wrong, either the overhead cost is too high, or the sales price is too low.
2. IVY is still under development, and will not be on the sales rack until 2023. And, same as QNX, profitability is another issue.
3. Partnership with Baidu is just on the paper talk, there is NO solid plans yet. Especially on the role that BB have to be involved, is it just supplying QNX and IVY at a discounted price for Baidu EV?

In short, great product with high adoption rate.

Upcoming product, but yet mature.

Matured product but the profit is not justified by the adoption rate, kind of overhyped in my point of view.",Gacha_Stocks,11,/r/stocks/comments/lvswes/is_blackberry_stock_still_a_good_buy/gpe95g6/,0.076,0.749,0.175,0.9719

230,GME," My general rule, this is just personal though, is don’t get involved with too many volatile, make or break short term plays. I was involved at the GME madness for a while and for that week it was all consuming. Couldn’t get off my broker app and sleep was affected. It was fun but eventually tiring.

Since then I keep investing in my ETFs and where I do “gamble” I do so in long term holds. For example I’m heavy in a couple of risky pennystocks. But because I’ve told myself they’re long term holds, I can get the enjoyment of checking in on them a few times a day. If they’re green, great! If they’re red, that’s ok too, because I don’t plan to sell them for a long while unless they truly go tits up. That’s how I balance some thrills with more boring patience.

Seems like the real danger is when you put a large sum into a stock that you want to see gains in the short term, so you need to be constantly on the ball, that is to say your brokerage app, to make those mad gains or cut them losses. I.e. day trading, which is undoubtedly fun, but yeah I totally can see why it would interfere with the other things in your life.

Stocks and money are important! And they’re fun. But so are many other things in your life, and some are more so.

244,MSFT," After I got married and started a family 2008, I threw all my Roth IRA into MSFT, Panasonic, TSM, and QQQ and didn't really look at it for about 8 years...  The main reason was because I was too busy with work and family to spend time investing. It grew a lot because I was in some very good names.  I got more involved because I had rolled over a 401k to an IRA and needed to re-deploy.

245,TSM," After I got married and started a family 2008, I threw all my Roth IRA into MSFT, Panasonic, TSM, and QQQ and didn't really look at it for about 8 years...  The main reason was because I was too busy with work and family to spend time investing. It grew a lot because I was in some very good names.  I got more involved because I had rolled over a 401k to an IRA and needed to re-deploy.

My trade depends on what happens down the line. I sold my first batch of NIO shares for \~100% gain or so near 55 dollars in November/December. Wanted to hold but after those gains I allocated capital elsewhere. The positive earnings looked pretty good and I'm happy to hold this if it moves slow and consolidates, or sell if we go to the moon and I'll bolster other positions like RTX or AAPL",_Please,2,/r/stocks/comments/lvmyfp/nio_earnings_01032021/gpd1h5h/,0.029,0.768,0.202,0.9932

303,DK," I disagree with your disagreement. Let’s start with, what is a moat? It’s a barrier that is difficult to overcome. For the next decade, no other sports betting company will be able to overcome this competitive advantage (minus NBA, they’re with fan dual until 2023). Furthermore Disney who owns ESPN also owns 6% of draftkings. Disney will choose DK for ESPN partnerships because of this.

311,AM," A day trade would just be if you bought shares of the stock and sold any amount of shares on the same day. I don’t recommend day trading at all, especially not when first beginning, although it would definitely not be unexpected to use at least 1 of those day trades. 

If you bought shares of a stock during regular hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM EST) and sold after hours (4:00 PM - 8:00 PM), it will still count as a day trade. If you bought after hours but sold the next day during pre market (4:00 AM - 9:30 AM), it will not be a day trade since they are on different days. It only regards whether it is on the same day or not, and it does not matter if you sell a small amount of your shares or all of them, it will still count as a day trade. Anyone, correct me if I am wrong.

Everything beyond here is just me reflecting and attempting to give advice. But you will probably just learn more and more by spending time with it. Good luck.


When I got started I was exactly in your position, starting out on Webull with just $100 and adding a bit more, but gradually you will just learn everything and probably a lot faster the more you read or watch. Just be careful about choosing the right sources of information as well as proceeding cautiously when it comes to stocks that are being pumped up or everyone is talking about it, whatever. I’d recommend using just a simple technical analysis strategy, like for me I use EMA6 and EMA10 on Webull, and when the lines cross that is a signal to either buy or sell, but typically I only use it as a buy signal (to place an entry position) because I do not plan to sell any of my stocks so soon. It’d probably be best to buy in at a small position first, not using all your money at once, until you confirm that the stock is moving upwards past your entry position. Not financial advice because I am still learning too, but just from my experiences. 

When it comes to it, I recommend 2 YouTubers: 
Deadnsyde - humble guy, he has run into some trouble recently because he grew so much popularity that the stocks he mentions usually rise quickly; HOWEVER, if you keep his stock picks in mind and wait for the right timing, and you believe that the company is solid, then it may turn out to be a great investment. Deadnsyde means “dead inside”, and the meaning is to keep emotions out of the stock market and remain dead inside so that you can remain logical in your investments. For example, you should really consider why you are selling a position before you sell it. If nothing has actually changed about the company itself, then you may want to reconsider.

Fastly is no doubt a great company with a great culture centered around user experience and customer satisfaction. Their tech has enormous potential and is at the center-point of several huge tech trends coming on in the next few years.

331,FB," Look into ETFs. If you like Apple and Microsoft (two great choices) look into QQQM (it’s like QQQ but a bit less liquid and with a lower expense ratio). The top two holdings are this two companies, but it also has Goog, FB, and many others. If you want something more aggressive on those same two stocks, there is VGT. Want something more diversified there is VOO or VTI (VTI is like VOO but with small and medium cap companies). You could look into QQQJ, GINN, ARKK, ARKF, ARKG, ICLN, URNM, MSOS/CNBS/TOKE/other weed ETFs, etc. Find an industry you think will grow and put some money in an etf or just dump it all in VTI and never touch it for 20 years and be amazed when you come back. Want to be more aggressive, do a mix of a few. VTI for the bulk, QQQM, QQQJ, ARKF and maybe some ARKG if you like genetics and a nuclear/weed etf to boot. 

Other notable ETFs in my opinion are SMH for semiconductors, WCLD or QTUM for cloud/content delivery, HERO or ESPO for esports/egambling, FDNI for international internet/commerce, and FLKR for S Korea market (Samsung and others and their market just recently started to turn around).",SuggestiveAmoeba5,4,/r/stocks/comments/lvuk88/what_would_you_do_with_5k/gpelskh/,0.066,0.805,0.129,0.9095

362,MSFT," QQQM and VGT carry a fair bit of overlap and this would put you very heavy on Apple and Microsoft. Nothing wrong with either of those stocks, I really like both with Apple advancing into their own computer processors and cars and Microsoft just dominating my office job (Outlook, Word, Teams, etc) and just killing it in the pandemic. Just make sure you check out ETF holdings so you know your potential overlap. If you want a portfolio that is 25% Apple and 25% Microsoft, there’s nothing wrong with that (invest in what you know) but just know that carries more risk than VTI where the top holdings are Apple (5.3%) and Microsoft (4.6%), but you also own hundreds of other stocks at 1% and below, so this one ETF is basically a massively diversify your portfolio. 

If you want to “prove him wrong” and beat out his 0.5% high yield savings, just dumping it all in VTI will pretty much do this. You want to be more risky, throw some QQQM or QQQJ in there. You want to be even more risky, ARKF (fintech) is really good in that time frame and possibly weed stocks. For you, ARKG is the genomics ARK ETF and could be life/world changing in 10-20 years. I also personally like nuclear, though idk if that nuclear etf is my favorite (for me it’s more a hedge on the 2 individual nuclear stocks I’ve picked after doing research into the sector). The only risk here is a market turn, but people who have spent the last 10 years predicting a crash have missed out thousands in gains. There was a “correction” in 2018 and another with the covid 19 pandemic. Even putting in at the peak right before both of those, you’d be back on top already. 2008s crash (~50% drop) took 5 years to recover just to add. However, it took 5 years for people who didn’t touch their money and didn’t invest more. Plenty of people had cash on the side, “bought the dip” to average down or take advantage of the sale, and they could have recovered even quicker. If you do ever buy the dip, do make sure to put a little in at a time since is is almost impossible to know where the actual bottom is. 

If you really want to stick with Apple and Microsoft, you can certainly do individual stocks, that just caries more risk than doing the ETFs.  VGT is 21.8% Apple and 16.1% MSFT with the third highest being Nvidia at 3.1%, so quite a drop there. This would be the “diversified way” of buying heavy into Apple and Microsoft. It has a 0.10% expense ratio by the way, so still very cheap (ARK ETFs are 0.75% which is high, but when they do a 150% growth year, people don’t complain). I will add this in too, ARKK, ARKQ, and ARKW are all very heavy on Tesla stock. I’m a bit of a Tesla bear, so it keeps me from putting more into those ETFs. That being said, Cathie Wood is an incredibly smart investor and she recommends you hold her ETFs for 5+ years. She also has some amazing theories on the technological convergence she believes is coming/happening (basically tech sectors coming together to cause insane growth like individual waves coming together to form a tsunami, this is one wave I’d love to ride onto the beach and into early retirement).",SuggestiveAmoeba5,2,/r/stocks/comments/lvuk88/what_would_you_do_with_5k/gpg9f4a/,0.061,0.818,0.121,0.9874

- ""good"" was in quotations because ticket sales have been trending downwards since 2002

- 3x the amount of shares exist in the market as did before COVID, leading to intense share dilution. Those $30 shares in 2017 would be worth $10 now at the same market cap.

370,AMC," Look at AMC'S chart for the past five years. It's driving off a cliff. AMC is nothing like Apple or Tesla bc they are innovative growth companies. To start a streaming service, which they're already way late to the game, they need content, subscribers, and a ton of capital of which they have none of. People need computers/phones, and electric vehicles are the future. Movie theaters and 2nd/3rd tier streaming services are not necessary.

Good luck with AMC",punkcitykid,1,/r/stocks/comments/lvuk88/what_would_you_do_with_5k/gpfgzq5/,0.085,0.849,0.067,-0.127
371,AMC," To address each point:


- read your post. Stock prices are indeed priced based on future expectations. That's why since 2017 the stock price for AMC went in the gutter, because the financial statements (which can show a lot about how the company's current situation will influence their future prospects) showed they were hemorrhaging money and would keep doing so.

- about 70 million of these shares were debt to equity conversions in November of last year and late January of this year. another 178 million issued to the market. You talked about companies being valued based on future prospects - they did this to avoid bankruptcy. The future prospects of the company at the end of last year when 178 million shares were issued is that the company wouldn't survive another year, and now it's doing the bare minimum to survive by issuing more debt and equity for a year while generating miniscule revenue because of covid that won't cover their expenses. How optimistic is that? What happens in 2022 when movie theaters are functioning again but AMC still has debt from 2017 + all the additional debt it's accumulated during covid (because it didn't just issue shares to avoid bankruptcy, it also took out more loans). 

- ""Even it’s supposed to be at $10/share, that’s 2017 valuation, and due to the stock market being valued at about twice that, we’re talking about $20/share in its current situation.""

 that's an awful argument. You are correct that the market has grown astronomically since 2017, and AMC's also plummeted astronomically since then because it wasn't growing at the same rate as the market.   


- In what world is AMC currently undervalued? It entered into the pandemic as the worst performing movie theater company and at its current price has the highest market cap despite all the problems I've talked about with it. Does that sound right? Like honestly, what advantage AMC accumulated since 2019 that makes its future prospects better than its competitors?",vedran64,1,/r/stocks/comments/lvuk88/what_would_you_do_with_5k/gpfxk65/,0.079,0.82,0.101,0.7022

374,CVS," I had a choice between TGT and Costco, and I went with Costco. Purely because, in my head, retail will exist in two forms in the future. 1) online shopping with same-day/1-day requests via drone delivery. 2) neighborhood wholesale warehouses.

Places like Target are essentially the median-income Walmart option (I.e. middle class suburbia). But just look at suburbia and you see Costco's being built everywhere....with lines out the door, membership/loyalty fees being a huge part of the business, and where bulk shopping is sooo much easier for family prep than generic retail shopping. Costco, with its gas stations, liquor stores, pharmacies, automotive services, grocery sections, and all household good commodities....they are literally an Amazon warehouse that you can walk into and buy stuff in bulk while also being the CVS/Walgreens that you used to ""pop into real quick""....and you never leave Costco without spending at least $100...like Costco is a CVS, Krogers, Walmart, Autozone, an Amazon warehouse, and a liquor store all rolled into one...

That's insane value imo, and people have a stronger sense of loyalty to Costco than Target (which is Target's main draw...customer loyalty)...and Costco even beats them at that.

Just my anecdotal experience, but every Costco I have seen is insanely busy (and so are Targets too) but Costco gives you so so so much more than target (I.e. all the services it provides to suburbia). Imo, the only winners in retail in the next 20 years is Amazon and Costco. Sounds crazy, but the only way Walmart and Target can compete in the future is to go full online and rival Amazon with delivery windows.

But imo ""bulk"" will be king for any sort of brick and mortar retailer in the future. No one except Costco is even remotely ready for that...you can mention Walmart's Sam's Club in this, but Walmart will have to pivot away from its generic stores and go hard into online and beefing up Sam's Club to keep Amazon and Costco in check. And to mention, Costco is a worldwide brand with an increasing global presence. Target isn't expanding. It is purely working on executing the job in front of them (focus on online sales). Well...Costco is doing that too...along with so so so much more....and globally. It may be overvalued at the moment, but I think it's the only ""brick and mortar"" retailer that has a shot with its current business model.

Unless they pose a systemic risk of blowing up the wider economy, the government isn't going to do shit. Too much of this generation only knows defaults through the lens of 2008.

The correct growth metrics to look at with LMND are IFP (In Force Premium) and GEP (Gross Earned Premium) at this stage. Traditional revenue and gross profit metrics are being heavily skewed by the 75% reinsurance rate and management addressed this on the letter.

Reinsurance is smart at this stage because it will avoid a catastrophic, bankruptcy-inducing scenario as they scale rapidly and take on larger claims than they might be able to handle at this stage.

As they scale and become more financially solid, they should pull back on reinsurance and revenue and gross profit will skyrocket accordingly.

Next ER should be an exciting one as they reveal more about their Life product (which will give them access to a huge TAM and put them up against the big boys). I’m convinced renters and pet insurance was only a gateway to build brand awareness and strength for competing in the more important, more profitable insurance segments.

Biggest concern is probably the low QoQ customer growth. Let’s hope it was just seasonal and a one-off. Definitely something to keep an eye out for.

Overall, really confident in how Lemonade is executing and I think management is being smart about how they scale and take on incumbents. Not surprising earnings are being misunderstood (it’s an insurance company after all. Accounting rules are different) and the company could get unfairly pummeled in the next few months, but fairly valued right now relative to growth IMO.

Also, guidance wasn’t even bad. They are expecting 80%+ increase in IFP and GEP for full year 2021, which is still outstanding.",elvita12345,3,/r/stocks/comments/lw5asq/lmnd_dip_is_the_time_to_buy/gpg9qrv/,0.057,0.791,0.152,0.974

825,TSLA," FNGU  I don't have to pick a  single stock as I get 10 of them.  It's leveraged 3:1 so it's hard for a single stock to outperform it.   But to find a stock that outperforms it, I have to choose one of the thousands available.  I just don't think my odds of picking that one stock that outperforms has much chance of success.

It came out on 1/23/18 so it has three years of track record.  It has appreciated about 565% since then.  TSLA has outperformed it until this year.  Year to date, FNGU is up about 23% while TSLA is down 2%.

 This includes the five core “FANG” stocks--Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet’s Google—plus another five actively-traded technology growth stocks—Alibaba, Baidu, NVIDIA, Tesla and Twitter.  

All of this is wrapped up in 3X leverage.  As you can see, I'm pretty bullish here.

2020 was an exceptional year for FNGU.  It wasn't without hiccups.  From to high Feb 18,2020 to its bottom March 19, 2020, FNGU fell 77% (TSLA  fell 60%). Even so, for the year, FNGU was up 360% for 2020.

836,LYV," The bull case is that Live Music and venues across America are so f*cked that LYV comes out of the pandemic with a near monopoly hold on the live music industry. A ton of venues are owned by people with limited capital who simply could not weather this storm, so LYV will get to purchase these venues for attractive valuations with the capital the market is still willing to give them. They have raised debt, and when people bought tickets pre-pandemic many have not asked for refunds but instead are hoping for re-scheduled shows. Who keeps that money? LYV. Who doesn’t? The venue owners, booking agents, tour managers etc. The bull case is LYV is the last man standing when this is all over.

851,AM," IF you have a ton of dough, you can get and IPO on the offering price from the brokerage that   is the lead underwriter.  

IPO business is known as Syndicate.  The syndicate is headed by a lead underwriter (ie. lead brokerage firm handling the offering.)  Also in that syndicate are what are called selling group firms.  

The lead underwriter gets the bulk of the IPO stock and the selling group firms get less.   An issuing company will tell the lead underwriter how much goes to institutional investors and how much goes to retail (peons like me and you,) There are reasons why a company might want more or less retail investors.  

If you have full service accounts around the street you might snag shares on the actual offering but IPO shares are considered ""favors"" that are given to their biggest clients.

At one point I was the syndicate coordinator for my office.   Advisors would give me their indications of interest (how many shares they wanted for all their clients.)  We almost never were given all we wanted so I would take the bulk of them for my clients and parcel out some to the rest of the office.  

Only full service accounts get shares.  They don't give them out to discount online accounts.

If you are unable to get IPO offering shares, you are going to have to buy them when trading begins.  In most cases, you might see the first trades around 10:00 AM or maybe later.  Typically, during the period before the actual IPO, the lead underwriter tries to match up the IPO price so that it pops about 10% when the stock opens.  That is why these are considered favors for the clients that get them in the IPO.  Most of the time they get it right, but sometimes they don't and stocks skyrocket.  Whatever you do, use a limit order as the opening may be way above the IPO offering price.

As underwriter, the firm will  support the IPO price for a few days up to about a week.  That means they will buy shares below the the offering price to support the IPO.  If the stock pops, they don't have to do that.  You can consider the IPO price the floor, so if you can get shares either from the IPO offering or on the exchange when the stocks starts trading, you can feel fairly confident your downside is limited.

859,RKT," To address your last questions, there isn't enough transparency to calculate short interest on a regular basis, it's done something like bimonthly and IDK why. What you'd do is look at the total # shares, ex 100,000,000 and the number of shares shorted ex 40,000,000 and you'd have 40% short float, or 40% of available shares shorted.

A 'high' number may be something like 20% at minimum but no number is absolutely high, it all depends on if the shares owned are willing to be traded. 

Look at RKT for example, 39% float, 68% shares owned by institutions. Seems high, why didn't they squeeze? Well you have to look at the options chain. Absolute short interest isnt all that relevant, In my experience, when hunting out short squeezes...what IS relevant, bc I'm assuming you're looking for a squeeze... Is IF the stock price is likely to close above price for all of the available call options. This would trigger a gamma squeeze, as I understand it. 

To look for this, go to Yahoo finance, type in the ticker symbol, find the 'options' tab and look at the contracts. When you scroll down you'll see the call options for a given date. If the stock closes higher than the highest call contract, then the stock is highly likely to get squozen. However, this is rare because new contracts are typically issued on a rolling basis.

RKT actually got kind of close last week. Closed around 23 and the highest available was something like 30. Earnings were great, another catalyst or two could have sent it over the threshold. 

This is how I understand this stuff, I don't trade options at all, I honestly don't understand this but I may understand it just enough to answer your question or guide you in the right direction.

*In the CRL, the FDA indicated its concern of safety risk to patients in terms of an increase in neutropenia-related sequelae on the Oral Paclitaxel arm compared with the IV paclitaxel arm.*

*The FDA also expressed concerns regarding the uncertainty over the results of the primary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR) at week 19 conducted by blinded independent central review (BICR).

They are my largest US holding. Been in since the 30s and have kept averaging up. Bought more today.

Their growth has been impressive and continual. They are essentially a small investment bank.

A couple bullish points- I think they are reaching an inflection point in size with being able to sole bookrun IPOs. This size will enable them to reduce their cost of capital and get bigger and bigger deals. They have also been capitalizing on the SPAC craze with a couple of their own.

Risks - They have been crushing returns in 2020 like many others.

941,ALL," Liquidity would be my first concern.  You can sell your listed reits any time you want.  While non-listed reits might tell you that you can do the same with them, I promise there is fine print that says they can suspend that.  The only way I would ever be on nonlisted real estate would be to own my own rental properties.

You also have huge interest rate risk. Reits trade, like utilities, based on the dividend yield they pay.  If rates rise, expect reits and utilities to fall in price.  Even dmall increases in rates will lower their price.

To answer your question, you have little risk in a listed reit being a ponzi scheme.  But you do have that with any public company.

I had a client (I am now retired) who bought a lisred contract printed  circuit board manufacturer at $2 per share that was growing 50% per year in sales and earnings.  

He kept buying over about 3 years as the stock rose to $20.  Then the auditors caught up with the company.  Essentually the company came out and said they made it ALL up, delisted, and filed bankruptcy.  The management team all went to jail.  He lost it all.

A perfect example was a client I had thst put about $20k in Dell the year they first went public.  He believed in their model of selling PCs they built to business customers.  He followed the company religiously.  

Then years later, all of a sudden the company decided to get on the low margin business of selling TVs to retail customers.  Dell never built their own TVs sonthey were just another reseller.

This caused my client to decide to sell his now $1 million in Dell.  And he lived happily ever after.

My understanding is that capital gains count towards your MAGI (modified adjusted gross income).  

If you find your MAGI restricts any roth contributions AND you have already contributed, you need to do something with it otherwise, you'll get taxed on it each year until you do.  One option is to recharacterize the amount to an traditional IRA.  And, if your traditional IRA does not already have any money in it, immediately back door is back to your roth.

This is what I did when I went over the income limit last year due to a job change and had already contributed at that point to my roth.
