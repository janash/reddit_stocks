13,DNN," I'm jealous of your position. I bought DNN at peak price in January and have been holding ever since. I saw all the $2.5 unusual call activity for 3/19 and April and figured there must be something going on that I don't understand. However, I lacked the conviction (and capital) to average down and benefit from the <$1 prices. 

Now, between being added to the TSX and their huge acquisition of physical uranium, I think I understand why people were betting big on DNN. I had planned on it being a long term investment, especially as the mine didn't even begin operation until 2024, but now they have a full supply of uranium and a full head of steam.

17,DD,"  good DD, the only problem i have with this is, ""It’s a fact that nuclear energy is cheap"".

That is absolutely false to make a substantial ROI in nuclear it takes years. New nuclear and nuclear refurbishments costs billions and it is the most expensive in the energy sector in terms of initial costs that almost always go over budget. That being said, the rise of green energy and small modular reactors is real but that is still years in the making so I would assume to see some small gains in Uranium stocks in the short term but nothing substantial for quite some time.

Compare this with $50 per megawatt-hour for solar and $30 to $40 per megawatt-hour for onshore wind.

52,DNN, sure my friend...options are more complicated than what im about to say but a call option...like the ones i bought...give me the right but not the obligation to buy 100 shares per contract ( i have 15 contracts) of a stock at a predetermined and agreed upon price.  in my example that price is $2...the reason i would do this instead of buying the stock at $1.30?  i have control of 1500 shares in my example or $900 ish...1500 shares outright would be $1900...so i use the other $1000 to but something else and im still have alot of leverage with DNN.   However...please read any of the gazillions of info about options out there before you attempt to play with them...they are very complicated if you let them be...they have many more factors and they do not trade $1 for $1.   what i mean is that if dnn goes to $2.3 tommorow....i will not make the $1 per share that you all do if you own the stock...ill make in the avenue of 50-75%.  but like i said before...i have lowered my risk to $900 vs $1900 should the stock tank....oh last part ...did i mention to please google options to get the full story?  there is a time component to options in that they have an experition...which in my case is jan 22....hope this helps a little...not all stocks have options so its awesome to find pennies that do....i mean 1500 shares for $900 bucks with 9 months more to play...,Win_Existing,22,/r/pennystocks/comments/m5ya5k/dnn_denison_mines_corp_undervalued_company_what/gr358ju/,0.017,0.84,0.143,0.9868

80,DD," Disclaimer: I do own the stock, but i will trow some thoughts out on this immense positive DD.  


First: The branding being the most important (RedBull used as example all the time).  
wel... I am sorry, but in my opinion they have to get a designer that is able to capture the culture. The logo is so cheap (old and new one). It doesn't communicate at all something a community can stand behind. I recognise this is a matter of taste, but i think if you want to be the redbull of psychedelics you better step up your game. I am just afraid that Todd's taste (or lack of it) it the issue here, so i am afraid we are stuck with this for the long run.  
But because of this i don't want to put so much weight on this aspect. I actually think most of their branding and cringe-meme attempts is super annoying.  


Second: The digital therapeutics case. Yes most psychedelic companies ar putting attention on this (Mindmed, Mydecine, RedLight) but i like to remind myself: this is for the veeeeeery long term, so i don't expect this to be the 'game changer’ in this year or the next.  


Third: Brazil.  
Yeah ok, first to export to Brazil, but i have the feeling this was 1 doctor that prescribed it to 1 client. So it will also take YEARS before this is of any value to the company.   
They focus a lot on the 'first one doing this, or that' but i would love to see a more detailed plan how to capitalise this.

AstraZeneca (AZN) was gaining more than 2% after saying it will supply the US government an additional 500,000 doses of COVID-19 therapy AZD7442, extending a previous deal's value by $205 million.",Houghton1983,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/m632gx/daily_plays_march_16_2021/gr4hznt/,0.0,0.878,0.122,0.9485

If you look at the three month chart there is a massive drop in December 2020, which followed after the press release that the phase III trial on SGX942 was unsuccessfull.

Then in January 2021 news came out that Soligenix would host a webcast event on the commercialisation of  SGX301, which was followed by a small price increase.

Finally there was a small price surge around 18 February, just after news was made public that Soligenix would present at the 2021 BIO & CEO Investor Digital Conference (news was released Feb 11th, Conference was held Feb 16-18th).

Of course the news and the price changes could be completely unrelated, no way to prove or debunk this, but I personally do find it reassuring to myself that there seems to be a clarification for recent price fluctuations *and* I like it when a stock at least seems to respond to the news/cataclysts that it gets.

Highlights

 - Exploits has received diamond drilling permits for 12 holes totaling 3,000 meters on the True Grit Gold Project.
 - The drill program will target the high grade gold targets within a halo (2.6 km long / 800 m wide Au-As-Sb surface soil anomaly) with historically wide low grade drill intercepts including 0.60 g / t Au over 117 meters  and concentrate 0.83 g / t over 26 meters from the surface.
 - Exploit's specified targets were defined through mapping, SGH ground surveys, and a high resolution VTEM aerial geophysical survey the Company recently conducted over the concession.

They are in the right place in Saskatchewan where you find some of the highest concentrations of helium in the world.

There first 3 wells and are drilled to depth and the results of the helium concentrations are expected this week.

Projection of 12 wells drilled by the end of the year.

Last Thursday it was 62c
Today it’s 73c
Friday who knows what price it will be.

It’s worth looking into as a long term hold. Like I said, my DD gives more information.",BandicootBeginning85,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/m5vyrb/royal_helium_anyone_rhcv/gr2jl6q/,0.0,0.902,0.098,0.8625

They also are one of North America’s largest helium lease holders.

So I’m thinking they have a decent chance of hitting possibly multiple 7’s.

Also, Siberia isn’t the best climate to drill and live in. Permafrost maybe there too? It’s just a rumour.
