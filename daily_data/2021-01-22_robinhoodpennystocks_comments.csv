""Atossa Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company seeking to discover and develop innovative medicines in areas of significant unmet medical need. Atossa‚Äôs current focus is on breast cancer and COVID-19. **We believe our innovative therapies and delivery methods can benefit COVID-19** patients and transform breast cancer treatment ‚Äì with the goal of preventing breast cancer from developing in the first place"" I will try to focus on a **possible near term catalyst** for the stock, which is about their **Covid Nasal Spray**, but their breast cancer treatments in the pipeline are also worth mentioning and researching for sure.

They currently have 2 COVID-19 therapeutic programs under development, **one for severely ill patients on ventilators and another for at-home use in patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19 who do not require hospitalization**.

What should we be excited about? 

Well, their current Nasal Spray with **AT301** is intended for at-home use to **proactively reduce symptoms of COVID-19**and to slow the infection rate so that a person‚Äôs immune system can more effectively fight SARS-CoV-2.  Atossa plans to identify potential partners who are developing COVID-19 diagnostic tests so that AT-301 nasal spray may be co-developed and commercialized with the goal of making the AT-301 therapy available at the time a person tests positive for the coronavirus. Atossa also plans to develop its nasal spray to potentially **help prevent COVID-19 infection -- particularly for people in high risk environments -- including, for example, people living with a patient infected with COVID-19, healthcare workers, emergency responders and teachers**.

**TARGET PRICE 5$**. yes. They have been doing direct offerings at market price in their recent past, which in my opinion is a good sign. They sold shares directly to institutions without discounting them. Remember the date, **January 26th** for the conference and updates on AT301 (possibly?).

What's **Atossa Therapeutics** ?

""Atossa Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company seeking to discover and develop innovative medicines in areas of significant unmet medical need. Atossa‚Äôs current focus is on breast cancer and COVID-19. **We believe our innovative therapies and delivery methods can benefit COVID-19** patients and transform breast cancer treatment ‚Äì with the goal of preventing breast cancer from developing in the first place"" I will try to focus on a **possible near term catalyst** for the stock, which is about their **Covid Nasal Spray**, but their breast cancer treatments in the pipeline are also worth mentioning and researching for sure.

They currently have 2 COVID-19 therapeutic programs under development, **one for severely ill patients on ventilators and another for at-home use in patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19 who do not require hospitalization**.

What should we be excited about? 

Well, their current Nasal Spray with **AT301** is intended for at-home use to **proactively reduce symptoms of COVID-19**and to slow the infection rate so that a person‚Äôs immune system can more effectively fight SARS-CoV-2.  Atossa plans to identify potential partners who are developing COVID-19 diagnostic tests so that AT-301 nasal spray may be co-developed and commercialized with the goal of making the AT-301 therapy available at the time a person tests positive for the coronavirus. Atossa also plans to develop its nasal spray to potentially **help prevent COVID-19 infection -- particularly for people in high risk environments -- including, for example, people living with a patient infected with COVID-19, healthcare workers, emergency responders and teachers**.

What's **Atossa Therapeutics** ?

""Atossa Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company seeking to discover and develop innovative medicines in areas of significant unmet medical need. Atossa‚Äôs current focus is on breast cancer and COVID-19. **We believe our innovative therapies and delivery methods can benefit COVID-19** patients and transform breast cancer treatment ‚Äì with the goal of preventing breast cancer from developing in the first place"" I will try to focus on a **possible near term catalyst** for the stock, which is about their **Covid Nasal Spray**, but their breast cancer treatments in the pipeline are also worth mentioning and researching for sure.

What should we be excited about? 

Well, their current Nasal Spray with **AT301** is intended for at-home use to **proactively reduce symptoms of COVID-19**and to slow the infection rate so that a person‚Äôs immune system can more effectively fight SARS-CoV-2.  Atossa plans to identify potential partners who are developing COVID-19 diagnostic tests so that AT-301 nasal spray may be co-developed and commercialized with the goal of making the AT-301 therapy available at the time a person tests positive for the coronavirus. Atossa also plans to develop its nasal spray to potentially **help prevent COVID-19 infection -- particularly for people in high risk environments -- including, for example, people living with a patient infected with COVID-19, healthcare workers, emergency responders and teachers**.

What's the consensus from analysts about the stock? **It seems that this stock is currently undervalued and has a lot of upside potential to grow**, I'm linking everything I've found on the web so you can see it yourself and analyse it with a different eye. As always, I'm trying to look for stocks with catalyst in the short term with a solid foundation, since many of you would like to profit as quick as possible. Here's the data :

**TARGET PRICE 5$**. yes. They have been doing direct offerings at market price in their recent past, which in my opinion is a good sign. They sold shares directly to institutions without discounting them. Remember the date, **January 26th** for the conference and updates on AT301 (possibly?). As you can see the stock seems to be moving, the more we get closer to that date.

üö® **Keep in mind mines is just speculation about what's going to happen, I do not have any medical background, I'm just trying to connect the dots**. Balance sheet is negative (like 99% of pennystocks) I'm not concerned though because I'm not planning to hold long term. I'm opening up a small position and see how things will turn out next week. What do you guys think? Everything I've written is linked from official websites, from the Clinical Trial results to the target price from analysts. I try my best as always to bring useful informations out, **I invite you to do your own research and be aware of all the risks involved investing in pennystocks**. Huge upside, huge downside. **YOU DECIDE IF IT'S WORTH IT OR NOT, YOU ARE THE BEST JUDGE ON YOUR NEXT MOVE** . ***Don't let me or other posters influence your decisions***. I'd like to hear your thoughts, let me know also about the negative aspects related to this stock since I'm keen to learn more everyday. **Thanks**. üö®

This has been one of the more active penny stocks we‚Äôve discussed over the last few weeks. Initially, it was based on the fact that ATOS stock fell in December, gapping down from $1.57 to under $0.90. The drop came after the company announced a $20 million public offering at a discount to market. Of course, traders aren‚Äôt keen on dilution. In this case, Atossa raised the money at a steep discount to its retail price at the time.

Needless to say, things have grown bullish once again. Not only has Atossa filled its gap, but it also tested levels near November‚Äôs high. The company is one of the ones that ‚Äúevolved‚Äù during the pandemic. The company focuses on breast cancer as well as COVID-19. Most recently, the coronavirus has been its bigger focus. As of a month ago, the company was in a Phase I study to see the efficacy of its drug, AT-301. This is a nasal spray that can be taken at home by those suffering from the coronavirus.

As far as potential milestones to keep in mind, the company has raised all of this money to put toward a few initiatives. This includes filing a pre-IND meeting request with the FDA for AT-301 and the commencement of a Phase 2 study in Sweden for its Endoxifen to reduce Mammographic Breast Density.",0.045,0.93,0.025,-0.8128

 I've been riding with TRCH for a while now because I do believe the dividends are going to be pretty good. The company just looks like it's in a really good spot and the internal buying was good to see. I intend to at least hold until the dividends go through.

The only concerning part is people dropping the bags too soon.

\-All the dividends go straight to TRCH shares holders. Meta legacy holders got nothing out of the dividends.

\-TRCH is basically a SPAC manager. Metamaterial pays TRCH by equity to get into Nasdaq. The ratio is 4-1, which means  4 shares of TRCH gets 1 share of Meta.

1. ""Will that convert to $500 of Metamaterial stock because of the 4-1 conversion and you take a loss"", Yes, your account, assumingly will take an instant hit after the conversion. This is the risk cost opportunity I pointed out. I classify this as a temporary loss, not a loss

2.Your account will be put in limbo during that time. After 6 months, after they sell all the assets, you will receive the dividends by June. If they still have some assets left, the deadline will be extended until December.

[3. In](https://3.In) the documentation, they clearly mentioned that 10% of the dividends will be on hold for a certain amount of time. If anything emergency happens, that 10% will be spent. If everything goes fine, 10% dividends will be promptly returned to TRCH holders

Quote - ""Analysts at Maxim currently have a Buy on the stock and an $8 target. That puts the firm‚Äôs ATOS stock forecast over 350% higher than current prices.""

This has been one of the more active penny stocks we‚Äôve discussed over the last few weeks. Initially, it was based on the fact that ATOS stock fell in December, gapping down from $1.57 to under $0.90. The drop came after the company announced a $20 million public offering at a discount to market. Of course, traders aren‚Äôt keen on dilution. In this case, Atossa raised the money at a steep discount to its retail price at the time.

Needless to say, things have grown bullish once again. Not only has Atossa filled its gap, but it also tested levels near November‚Äôs high. The company is one of the ones that ‚Äúevolved‚Äù during the pandemic. The company focuses on breast cancer as well as COVID-19. Most recently, the coronavirus has been its bigger focus. As of a month ago, the company was in a Phase I study to see the efficacy of its drug, AT-301. This is a nasal spray that can be taken at home by those suffering from the coronavirus.

As far as potential milestones to keep in mind, the company has raised all of this money to put toward a few initiatives. This includes filing a pre-IND meeting request with the FDA for AT-301 and the commencement of a Phase 2 study in Sweden for its Endoxifen to reduce Mammographic Breast Density.",0.045,0.93,0.025,-0.8128

Select this SubReddit, past 7 days, click Compare, sort by stock price. That's just the ones being talked about here...

Edit: I look at this website each morning before the stock market opens, look at the past 6 hours for this sub, and use that in combination with the newest posts here to try to decide what to buy for the day. I'm not investing a log, just practicing still, but I've doubled my money in under a month by following the conversations here and using the site linked above. I'd also suggest learning to use the Trailing Stop feature on RH. Now I just need to put enough in my RH account to avoid being labeled as a pattern day trader!",0.058,0.942,0.0,-0.7651
