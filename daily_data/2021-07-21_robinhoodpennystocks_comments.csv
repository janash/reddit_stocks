0,RH," What's the deal with the preferred shares from the TRCH dividend? Are they actual shares? They don't show any value in RH and can't be traded.

9,NURO," Question for y‚Äôall. I of course was lucky enough to hop in on NURO at a low price today. Finally scored a win.

The free float is 3.77 million shares out of 3.8 million total outstanding. Yet, someone posted that the short volume was over 115 million today.

15,CEMI," Ugh....I am so happy yet mad at myself at the same time. 

After observing various penny stocks, I noticed a pattern and decided to attempt a day scalp with CEMI. And it worked! Got a basis at 4.12 and was able to ride it up. But I was in a remote meeting all the while which was messing with my focus and the price started getting shaky so I decided to to lock in profit at 5.30. And then 10 min later it proceeds to clear 6 bucks. UGH. 

You never go broke taking profit and I wasn't gonna risk that going awry but gosh dang it's still frustrating to think of how much more could have made if you chanced it a little longer.",OKJMaster44,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ooedlu/daily_discussion_thread/h60dp2z/,0.096,0.762,0.141,0.7392
