2,TSLA," Having traded TSLA for years (and following it obsessively to the exclusion of almost anything else), I've always done a ridiculously good job of buying the dips (most recently when it dropped and I snagged it at $560.. but also when it dipped to $198 within the past couple years, and again after the pandemic hit) -- in part because I was fully convinced that the FUD was transparent bullshit, and I felt that the difference between the FUD and the reality was easy to read..

Even if you reduce risk and give yourself flexibility to time things by selling earlier prior to expiration, you're potentially missing out on a lot of gains.. and if you don't hold out for the big gains, then maybe you're not adequately compensating for your losses on bad bets.

Also, TSLA spent an awfully long time hovering around the (pre-split) $300 mark. I was there, and I didn't know when it was going to break out.. and after waiting so long, I'd become cynical and was incredulous that the rest of the market would jump on board and take it to where it belonged prior to seeing the actual returns (but they did, and I didn't anticipate the extent of it).",NewFolgers,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mb08an/trying_to_time_a_tsla_trade/grvtxjb/,0.119,0.83,0.051,-0.8555

61,TSLA," Yes what this guy said, cyclical. I just notice patterns and they work on TSLA. after it's been beat up for a bit throw calls at it. I day trade them because my risk tolerance is low at the moment. I always exited early this year. Last year I always exited too late. The main thing I aim for is to catch volume spikes either on red days or green days it doesn't matter because when the volume is there it's going to rip. So if it plummeted, it's almost certain there's going to be a rip later that day. I usually buy the call and look for it to go profitable ASAP so I can have cushion. Up 10%-20% in the first 15-20 minutes? I keep holding. If I'm hanging on for half an hour and it keeps dancing around negatives I just sell it. The rallies are strong and decisive the dips bleed you dry waiting for that rip. Then rinse and repeat. Also another rule: no puts. It's more likely for tsla to go up than down.

Today looks to be the day for some major news out of Gamestop and it's already starting in advance of the Earnings and Conference call scheduled for after close today. Why are we looking forward to today's news catalysts? Catalysts drive volume which drives price.

Last big news catalysts?

**3/23** - Breaking news this morning, [SEC filings indicate](https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/8-k/0001193125-21-090320) that Gamestop Chief Customer officer Frank Hamlin is stepping down after a transition ending 31 March. Who could possibly replace him? How about Kelli Durkin, Chewy’s prior Vice President of Customer Service who was [brought on with Gamestop March 1 as Senior VP of Customer Care](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-appoints-chief-technology-officer). There is no confirmation that she is the replacement at this time.

No known impact on volume yet from this breaking news.

Following that announcement we can expect to hear about a replacement for their CFO, the *possibility* that Ryan Cohen may be taking a new role within Gamestop, and with the end of the pre-earnings blackout period Gamestop will be free to announce any transition initiatives moving forward.

*A note on earnings:* **Gamestop's fiscal year runs through January**. So the Q4 report will include holiday sales, the console release, increased offerings of PC parts, and any additional sales driven through Jan from suddenly getting a ton of free press and consumer goodwill.

These do seem like attacks. There is still a lot of upward momentum trying to push through. Will it stay this way until close?

If GME ends on an upward swing, especially in the Green, and Earnings are good, that's really bad for HFs.

At this point, I don't know what exactly is going on. It could be shorts, it could be whales leaving. There's a lot of ripples going on at the moment. GME appears to be trending back down.

Here's my response to anyone pointing to GMEs decline as proof that the squeeze is done.

How long did it take for HFs to get the price below 200?

How long will it take for them to get it down to 40 at its current velocity?

Gamestop has been in a blackout period where they can't announce anything. That veil is released tonight. Gamestop can announce whatever the fuck they want starting tomorrow. 

Do you actually believe that for the next however many weeks that there's going to be absolutely 0 good news for Gamestop?

None of this even takes care of the original problem in the first place: There are MILLIONS if not TENS OF MILLIONS if not HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS shorts that still need to close. How the fuck do they close them and keep the price below 40?

Like I've been saying. These 2 days? They don't matter. Gamestop resets tomorrow. The game changes tomorrow and I'm fucking excited to see what the game has to offer.

Current price: 183.57

**3:06 Update**

Holy fuck. GME almost hit the SSR line too. If that had happened right before the whales jumped in, I would've died. Especially if the Earnings Report went well, that wouldn't been so bad for the HFs.

Anyways, Power Hour is full go. This shit's exciting.

This is why this strategy can absolutely backfire on them.

Current Price: 182

**2:49 Update**

Yo GME, wtf. I said nothing drastic.

GME decided it wants to fall some more. It's currently at around 182 and volume is picking up. They're literally banking on a bad earnings call. Not a neutral earnings call, but a shit the bed bad earnings call.

I just don't see the point in making this move now. There's not enough volume to suggest that people are actually leaving their positions. Everyone is waiting for Earnings. Friday was the last day that actually mattered as far as stock perception was concerned. If this plan fails, they're only going to be in a much bigger hole. Even if their plan succeeds, there's no guarantee that a bad earnings call ends the squeeze pressure.

They're trying though. Let's see what they do through power hour.

Current Price: 179.45

**2:32 Update**

Guess who didn't take a shit this morning! Guess who's lucky that I came home early today!

GME, please don't do anything drastic while I'm gone.

**2:22 Update**

I don't think I ever explained why I think about the stock market like I do.

If you love the stock market, and you love board games. Find a group that plays 18xx games. These are stock market manipulation games where you start and run railroad companies. There is dedicated community that has been around for decades. There are international tournaments. 

The goal of the game is to have the highest net worth. You can build awesome companies that make huge profits. You can make shitty companies that you embezzle and dump away. You can make shell companies. There is so much crazy shit you can do with the stock market simply by buying or selling. It's amazing.

I had one of the best players of the game teach me this game, and I've played the games for years. At tournaments, I played against literally the best 18xx player (Literally the Tiger Woods of 18xx) a few times and experienced some of the most crazy mind bending financial fuckery that he had planned for hours.

When I say I know how to think like a HF, I've done it by studying those games. I know its not exactly the same, but enough concepts are the same to where I've been able to make a damn good amount of money here.

If there's anything I want more outside of charity donations, its for everyone to find an 18xx community in your city, and try the game out. It's absolute crack and it'll help you appreciate just how fucking crazy the stock market actually is.

101,SI," Real talk. So many of us retards are buying and holding. You constantly see “bought 10 more or 1 or even 20. We have to own way over 100% of the float. Let the at sink into your smooth brains and realize that hedgies have no way out of this if we hodl. Institutions own like 200% of the float. Add that on to our shares and 50% short interest(which is a low estimate ) would be more like over 100% SI. Take a breather. Trust in this bet and actually do something cool with your life and make a ton of money off of something so simple and stupid that it’s actually going to work

* Comparable store sales increased 6.5%;  

* Net sales were $2.122 billion compared to $2.194 billion in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter, reflecting an operating environment that included a 12% decrease in the store base due to the Company’s strategic de-densification efforts and a reduction of approximately 27% in European store operating days during the quarter as a result of temporary store closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic;  

* Global E-Commerce sales (included in comparable store sales) increased 175% and represented 34% of net sales in the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter versus 12% of net sales in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter;  

* Gross margin was 21.1%, a decline of 610 basis points compared to the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter, reflecting an expected mix shift toward lower margin console sales in response to the launch of generation 9 consoles, increased freight and credit card fees associated with the shift to E-Commerce sales, and a broader promotional stance;  

* Selling, general and administrative expenses were $419.1 million, a decline of $92.6 million, or 18%, from $511.7 million in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter, driven by the Company’s cost optimization initiatives;  

* Income tax expense was a benefit of $69.7 million due to a change in the tax status of certain foreign entities, and the impact of the CARES Act, including tax benefits associated with the availability of a five-year carryback period for certain current year tax losses (which compares to income tax expense of $43.8 million in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter), and;  

* Net income was $80.5 million, or $1.19 per diluted share on 67.8 million shares outstanding and included a $1.03 per share tax benefit as described above, as compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.32 in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter.   Adjusted net income was $90.7 million or $1.34 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $83.8 million or $1.27 per diluted share in the prior year fourth quarter.  


**Fiscal 2020 Overview**

* Comparable store sales decreased 9.5%;  

* Net sales were $5.090 billion compared to $6.466 billion in fiscal 2019, reflecting an operating environment that included the impact of operating during the wind-down of the seven-year-old prior console cycle, a 12% decrease in the store base due to the Company’s strategic de-densification efforts, which was partially offset by recaptured sales via nearby stores and E-commerce, and a significant reduction in global store operating days as a result of temporary store closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic at various times throughout the year;  

* Global E-Commerce sales (included in comparable stores sales) increased 191% increase for the fiscal year and represented nearly 30% of total net sales;  

* Gross margin was 24.7%, a decline of 480 basis points compared to the prior year primarily driven by the expected mix shift toward lower margin console sales in response to the launch of generation 9 consoles, increased freight and credit card fees associated with the shift to E-Commerce sales and a broader promotional stance;  

* Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.514 billion compared to $1.923 billion from the prior year, a reduction of $408.5 million, or 21.2% from the prior fiscal year;    

* Income tax in fiscal 2020 was a benefit of $55.3 million driven by a change in the tax status of certain foreign entities and the impact of the CARES Act, including tax benefits associated with the availability of a five-year carryback period for certain current year tax losses, compared to income tax expense of $37.6 million in the prior fiscal year;  

* Net loss of ($215.3) million, or ($3.31) per diluted share compared to net loss of ($470.9) million, or ($5.38) per diluted share in the prior fiscal year.

**Executed on financial and operational initiatives**

* Delivered a $408.5 million, or a 21.2% reduction in SG&A expense in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, primarily driven by continued cost optimization initiatives  

* Strategically de-densified the Company’s store base by closing a net 693 stores in fiscal 2020 while transferring sales to online platforms and neighboring locations;  

* Achieved 30% decrease in inventory at fiscal year-end, leading to annualized inventory turns of 5.9x as compared to 4.4x in the prior year, and a 10% decrease in accounts payable at fiscal year-end as compared to fiscal 2019.  

* Ended fiscal 2020 with $635 million of cash and restricted cash;

Apparently my audio was delayed. Call is over. 

The price has dipped down to 155, but this is after-hours. This is probably going to change significantly until markets open tomorrow. I won't be putting too much stock until I wake up tomorrow and see how the dust settles. 

I will see you all tomorrow! 

Current Price: 158

**5:26 Update**

Did anyone else lose the call?

Current Price: 154.29

As I'm watching the market move while the call is going on, I wonder how much of it is genuine reaction, and how much is an attempt to establish some sort of image.

Apparently the market is bullish about introductions.

Current Price: 180

**5:03 Update**

Volume right now has been pretty similar to what we saw towards the end of the day today. If that is the volume after-hours, this might point to a ridiculous amount of volume coming in tomorrow.

Duh, it's the day after Earnings, there is of course going to be a bump in volume, but how big will that bump be?

We still haven't started with the call.

Part of my frequent updates is to point out just how much the price is fluctuating.

Remember it's going to take time for people to go through the report enough to understand how good or bad it is. I'm not taking too much stock in these prices yet. I'm going to wait until tomorrow morning before I really start to assess how the market is reacting to all of this.

**4:37 Update**

I'm listening to the call music. Why not play orchestral versions of video game music? How cool would it have been if we were listening to some full orchestral Legend of Zelda music right now.

This music isn't even American. Gamestop. Please.

GME has no idea what it wants to be right now. Price fluctuations are crazy right now.

417,SNDL," This

And Sundial focuses on indoor growing whereas many competitors are pivoting away from cultivation. Sundial meanwhile is privoting from being a wholesaler with weaker margins to being growers with branded product. Weed in Canada predictably plummetted in value once it was legalized and consumers want potent weed at a fair price. SNDL being indoor growers are well placed. We have a drug dealer growing it and selling it to retail shops.

Nonetheless, you can see share dilution in the stock's downward decline last year. There was an inflection point where sentiment shifted from downward on the dilution to upward on the news talked about in the above comment. The rise to $3+ earlier this year probably reflected some disconnect in the value which is now being corrected. How far this correction goes is anyone's guess. I wouldn't be surprised by $0.75 share prices.

Edit: Also a big part is SNDL avoiding being delisted by the NASDAQ, which they faced in the latter portion of last year up until recently. They had to achieve 10 consecutive trading days above $1 and managed to do so handily. In my opinion, they weren't in much danger of being delisted, however, because they could have executed a reverse split, and that seemed to be on the table. But the removal of that threat pumped the price up.",U_F_ail,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbfx1i/go_banana/grylp65/,0.044,0.866,0.09,0.7724

420,GME," I do not think weed stocks are going to be that big of a deal.

Weed is more profitable as an illegal substance than a legal one.  It is sad but true.  The more legal weed gets the lower the price of it should be.  Plus, if people can grow their own their is little reason to buy from a company.

Extracts and concentrates have some merit I suppose.  So, in the long term if someone wanted to bet on a company one that is focuses on Concentrates might be a solid investment.  As it becomes more legal I am sure some of the weed stocks will go up.  Just by the nature of a new market.  One of the companies will take over the turf.

But, I never invested in weed stocks because I did not think it would be a big deal.  But, after GME ride is over with some people might jump off and back onto weed and the numbers might go up for a second.

Sadly, I put about 20 dollars in ""Mind Medicine"" because it sounded like it might have more merit than weed.  But, basically because not alot of places have legalized shrooms and the Market is fairly open with little competition.  But, when GME started going up that stock went from 4 to ~2.50ish.  I haven't been paying attentions.  I went into GME with 5 shares @ 92 and road out the 40 dip.  If I had more loose money I would have bought more at 40.  But, yea.  I cashed out a couple shares @ 285 to cover my investment and just bought back in a couple.

422,SNDL," I don’t think it would be a matter of traction, but more the stage for them to swoop in has been set. Obviously Canopy and Tilray look like pretty good stocks. Not saying they arent the future top dogs in the industry but for like $1.30/share compared to the other choices, it seems like it could be a pretty good bet that SNDL could see a big increase in price if federal legalization in the US would happen this year.  They aren’t really undervalued right now given their ER but looking towards the future, given the factors I mentioned already, it seems like something I’d be pissed to look back a year later and wish I got in at ~$1 instead of something crazy in the 20s or higher. 

Or maybe they are sitting on giant pile of money like Smaug and just getting rich off their shareholders. You gotta do your own research and figure out what fees right to you.

We’ll know when fins are released next week. They have great gross margins and would be profitable if they weren’t burdened by debt that hexo can pay. Zena also gives hexo access to Europe markets. Zena CEO was president of McCain’s and Mars Canada so he has connections. Hexo has been growing steady themselves. Revenue and margins keep increasing. Their beverage sales exceed canopy. Positive ebitda first time last Quarter. Cash position is strong. I think combined these two companies are going to be a major player and their market cap is substantially less than the other guys.

432,THC," They're the same plant. The differentiation between ""weed"" and ""hemp"" is only made by law enforcement, and the only difference is THC content. Hemp still has THC, it's just lower. Once legalization occurs, anyone growing will be able to do both; the buds are ""weed,"" and other parts are ""hemp.""

It's probably a bit more complex than that, but that should be reasonably accurate. Basically, weed stocks are mostly growing companies at the minute, and those companies will be able to cash in on both of those crops simultaneously, which means they are poised to profit  **massively** from legalization and a global switch to hemp manufacturing.",Eruionmel,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbfx1i/go_banana/gryh3q1/,0.014,0.897,0.088,0.7992

435,THC," I am aware that they are related.  But, they are not the same plant.

The THC of Hemp is MUCH MUCH lower than weed.

Plus, the state and federal government should have different rules regarding both.  Also, Weed production because it is targetted as a consumable ""Should"" have different regulations.  Similar to food.  

But, hemp because it is not targetted at consumption should be able to get away with looser regulations.  Also, because they do not a good yeild out of it they will not have to remove all of the male buds.  So, productions should be cheaper.

470,GME," Dude, I'm a mouth breathing retard, and I'm bullish AF on GME and bearish AF on most of the market.

My dumdum take is this - low interest rates and excess liquidity in the market have provided incentives for funds and institutions to leverage themselves out of their fucking minds seeking gains. Why were they so fucking scared of interest hikes? They KNOW they're overexposed to a pullback.

Now, my strategy in case the GME people are right is this: assuming GME still has squeeze potential (numbers seem to point in that direction for sure) and hopefully, funds are commiting fraud out their ass to keep shorting it. When/if it squeezes and they get caught, the margin calls will force massive sell offs, and STILL the short sales will not settle as it is IMPOSSIBLE to settle them - like a black hole of finance. Thus more assets getting liquidated, price goes down, which forces margin reductions in institutions that had nothing to do with GME, causing more sell offs, and so on and so forth. 


As GME rises and the market crashes, and GME effectively sucks all the money in the market into itself, banks that back the DTCC file for chapter 11 and chaos ensues. The entire market will be on sale. Easy money to be made on shorts, puts and buying the dips. The chaos will be beautiful.

472,AAPL," Then I’m sorry but you are missing on literally half of the market. Don’t listen to the people here, shorting a stock is literally the opposite of buying a stock in the hopes that it goes up, you just predict it goes down a bit (it doesn’t have to be much). If you don’t short, you can never take advantage of the market going down, only up. It’s like Ying and Yang, imagine skiing... if you could only go up and up and up with the Chairlift and you never go down skiing... isn’t it quite missing the point?

People always associate shorting a stock with putting them out of business - no lol, that is only something that hedge funds can do with a massive amount of shorting. You can even short things like AAPL for example for 1 week if you think it’s going down. No, you are not gonna put Apple out of business 🤣🤣 

“Normal” shorting is just: stock going down? Short, let it go a bit down (some dollars is fine) and cover. Immediately after: Buy, let it go up and sell. It’s a dance.

517,GME," I mean... considering what the banks did with CDO's during the '08 crash, and considering that only like 1 person went to jail and the rest of everyone on wallstreet got pay raises in the aftermath, I see no reason why a market entity that posts data that is available to us peasants wouldn't knowingly and willfully mislead us with their data and I see no reason why brokerages that are used by the peasantry wouldn't knowingly and willfully pass that misleading info along.

It's not that we're too stupid to start seeing through the fuckery, its that there will never be anything more than a slap on the wrist and, if they really tank the entire global economy, maybe even a stern wag of the finger for profiting from destroying common people's lives.

I genuinely hope GME bleeds these sociopaths dry and the resulting payout throws the entire market into chaos. I'm looking forward to using my new found millions to pick up a ton of prime time stocks for pennies on the dollar.

edit: Upon further thought, I'd like to point out how interesting things might get as all of this market data continues to pool here on reddit and aggregate through a filter of endless skepticism until it's purified into a format that is ELI5-usable and so fuckery free you could eat off of it. I've been watching and lurking and that's the pattern I'm seeing. There are so many of us bringing in so much data to this site and it's all free.

Maybe we don't need a seat at the table if we simply just build our own fucking table from the ground up.

522,GME," JFC not this again. **You not understanding how things work doesn’t make it a fucking conspiracy.**

FINRA publishes short volume and total volume for off exchange and dark pools. It doesn’t report exchange trades (you have to pay NYSE and NASDAQ to see that)

Fintel uses the short volume from FINRA and divides by total volume. This is pretty stupid but if it’s consistent methodology it doesn’t really matter. 

Neither calculation is perfect. OTC short volume/ total volume understates short volume. OTC short / OTC total volume is only giving you a picture of dark pool flow which isn’t complete. 

**either way it doesn’t fucking matter because as has been stated a thousand times short volume can’t help you calculate short interest**

***INTERPRETING DAILY FINRA SHORT SALE REPORTS***

I’ve seen a lot of posts about FINRA daily short sale reports and what it means. Importantly it doesn’t mean what you think. This isn’t FUD it’s just how market making works.

TL;DR a lot of the short volume is market makers shorting to facilitate *buy* orders and they immediately cover with the next trade. 

-High short volume in the FINRA report actually often reflects net BUYING. This is why trying to interpret these reports is pretty much useless. 

-That sounds crazy but that’s how market making works. 
-FINRA report is only for off exchange trades (dark pools). It’s a myth that dark pools are all institutional, your retail broker is sending trades to dark pools like Citadel, Virtu, etc. 

-A MM makes money on the spread between buying and selling (obviously). 
What happens is - your order to buy 100 shares of GME at market gets sent to a dark pool. The MM (a computer) SHORTS you those shares at $108.793 and then BUYS those shares back at $108.791. A short of 100 shares is recorded. This also explains how you see ridiculous volumes and ridiculous # of shorts every day for a stock that has a 50M float. The MM isn’t “going short” GME. They short it for a millisecond then buy a fraction of a penny lower a millisecond later.

-So high short volume in the FINRA report (which is ONLY reflecting off exchange trades (dark pools) does NOT necessarily reflect high levels of actual shorting. It often reflects high levels of buying! Um. Like we just saw this week. Repeat that It does also does NOT reflect exchange trades. The total volume will not reflect the total volume traded on the day, 

You don’t have to believe me you can read this super interesting piece here. Generally speaking, the idea that large short volume in the report is good news for holders seems true! It’s just not for the reasons you think.

530,SI," Thank you, genuinely interesting find, and impressive investigation.

Is this a case of Finra use the data that pass through the exchanges, giving a relative SI for the data they have. Using total volume that you found everywhere else means that they can't use the short data within the exchanges as that ignores the difficult to track short data outside the exchanges. Are they simply assuming that as long as they use the data they know the ratio will be similar given a 3 fold increase in volume equates to a similar growth in shorts?

In all honesty, it'll be incredibly difficult to nail any of this down, as if they're happy to simplify their lives trading through dark pools/off exchange, then there is theoretically no limit on how many shorts they can pass through them and the exchanges though lower may not be a reflection of everything.

Think along the lines of why it is considered a good gauge of an election by polling 1% or less of the population.

536,BE," Sounds right. Question to see if I’ve got it: basically we can imagine that there’s a legit reduction to the volume as finra is reporting - instead of every actual share (or counterfeits, too, whatever for these purposes) that trades, just those corresponding to “customer orders” so as not to double count - then the calculation of short volume, so long as consistent with that reduction, is fine too. But then, simply, the calculation SHOULD BE finra short vol divided by finra total vol. 

Like, it makes no fucking sense to take the vol reduced/ no double-counting number for the numerator and the vol unreduced/ double-counting number for the denominator ? 

I agree re fintel and the blame. But I don’t get how if this is blatant misdirection they could get away with it.",leriess,119,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mb72z0/finra_reporting_inaccurate_total_trade_volume/grwhjfd/,0.049,0.866,0.084,0.4215

Actually I made a post about that 2 weeks ago. You can find it in my post history. I update this simplistic model every day and it suggests increasing short rates.

540,DD," So I am no expert but from various DD and just posts theorizing on what is happening I have read that brokerages can trade stocks bank and forth in small increments to lower price. Makes sense to my small brain. Nothing guarantees the HF or brokerage has to sell to each other at current market prices. The can deliberately sell for less than current price. If brokerage A Sells to brokerage B for gradually smaller amounts over the day back and forth 2 things would happen 1 stock price would drop, 2 this off book transaction may not show up in finra. This makes sense as they only want to report actual trades. And what the brokerage is doing is basically a hot potato game with the sole purpose of dropping price to an amount they both want and ending when the shares are back in original hands. Paper losses creating massive fake sales. Then they could purchase the shares at a much lower price to cover shorts that need returned or naked calls they sold that are now in the money and were executed at the higher price. This strategy would lower losses. For real market manipulation, but off book so they would be at less risk of being caught. One thing is needed for sure, they need to make it so that all trades have to be executed on exchanges, and they need real-time settlement of trades. The real question is why the other firms choose to include these off book transactions which skews the short interest. I get why the shorting HF / brokerage would want the short interest hidden.

541,GME, I'm surprised. You'll find lots of info about it on here (I think like a month ago) but the basic gist is hedge funds are shorting ETFs that have GME and then going long on the non-GME stocks that are in the ETF.

If shorting the whole ETF can reduce the value of all the underlying securities, and those ETFs have shares based on a %value, then wouldn't shorting the entire ETF while GME is gaining quicker than the rest just lead to a rebalancing where the ETFs dump shares of GME?

627,CPA," Lots of good advice here. Thanks for writing up a guide that gets people thinking in the right direction.

A couple things I'd like to add:

>my personal recommendation would be to pay off the mortgage up front, so that you aren't putting a strain on your new income source

Granted, you did a good job explaining that there are two schools of thought here. I'd just like to say that with mortgage rates ridiculously low right now (below 3%, where 8% is more typical historically), if you are really trying to optimize wealth, it is a no-brainer to put your money into any investment you think will beat the 3% rate and you'll come out ahead. The reason to pay off your mortgage early is not a financial reason, but for mental health because you just don't want the stress of carrying debt.

>becoming a real estate agent

How is getting a job as a real estate agent ""investing in real estate""?

>financial advisor, a tax advisor/CPA, a real estate advisor (should you want to enter real estate), an attorney, and an insurance advisor

All of these with the ""advisor"" title means they are a salesman trying to sell you the products that earn them the biggest commission. Don't fall for it. For example, hire a financial fiduciary instead of a financial advisor because a fiduciary has official certification and a legal obligation to act in your best interest (like a doctor or attorney).

>Dave Ramsey

I'm not personally familiar with his teachings, but everything I hear says he is good for people in bad financial shape who need help getting out of debt, but not useful for people in good financial shape.

>4% of your net worth can be used yearly

The portion of your net worth you have in homes, cars, etc. are not appreciating 7% per year.",FishDawgX,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbg2t5/how_to_keep_your_newly_minted_title_of/gryfuup/,0.073,0.786,0.141,0.9727

629,AMC," I got the ""giving"" part figured out. A few weeks ago, a client gave me a $20 tip. I didn't like working with her, or the energy she brought into my space. So, I decided to give it to a homeless person, to kinda reset the energy of the money. I then opened another tip envelope and that client gave me $60. So, I matched the dirty twenty with a clean twenty. When looking for an unused envelope to give this $40 away to one person, in particular, I found another $20 that I had never opened. Now, the guy has $60 coming his way. Nice!

On my way to work, that voice in my head whispered ""You know, you could invest this in the market."" I mentally responded with ""But it's not my money to spend.""

During a session that day, the light went on above my head. This homeless guy has no idea he has $60 coming his way, so I might as well invest it and give him the returns. I now have 6.14 of my modest AMC share count specifically slated to give away.

I'm gonna gift my mom a little bit, AFTER I've had some time to keep this knowledge private. The rest of the money is mine. I want to upgrade some aspects of my life and figure out how to get even a modest passive income happening.

I disagree with 4% though. For the Dutch situation I would say assume nominal yield of 7%, -2% for inflation, -1.5% for wealth tax, leaves about 3-3.5% to spend. Taxes are already covered in that case though, so I don't know if 4% is supposed to be a before-tax or after-tax number.

647,GME," When people questioned my faith in GME, one of my best questions was to ask if they could tell me the difference between COD Black Ops 4, COD WW2, or COD Black Ops Cold War. I asked them if they knew the different specs between an XBOX or a PS5. I asked of they thought the guy at Wal-Mart or Target knew. I asked if they thought the guy as Best Buy would know. Then I asked about GameStop and the point was clear. The only store that would come close to the dedicated knowledge was Best Buy but it the layouts and size make Best Buy feel more ""intimidating"".

So what does GME need to do to exploit their role as the best small to medium footprint gaming retailer?

My first step is heavy on exclusives. Promotions with Pokemon cards and Magic cards. Promotions for exclusive in game content like they have done with Fortnite. Like all the time. Geolocked content that gets released at GameStop like Legendary Pokemon in various Pokemon games. Exclusive merch like Amibos. Definitely need some exclusive Funko Pops for those degenerates. Exclusive premium launch bundles.

Essentially, get stuff that gamers from all corners of fandom want and can only find at GameStop.

That’s not why I believe Cohen went all in. I think there is a bigger play he has in mind with digital gaming assets. There is a missing part of the digital market place that involves ownership, royalties, and resales which I think he is after and which the time is right to capture.

Everyone was wanking themselves silly about rkt being shorted. What they didnt realise is that the shorts weren't shorting rkt, it probably is a good company. They were actually shorting the entire market that RKT sits in. Aka the housing market...

753,DD," I've been wanting to find a way to compile the spammed posts into something people can browse. I think they'd approve of the bulk of what we're up to and disapprove of a very small percentage mostly due to opinions on *what is WSB content or not*. It looks pretty good from where I'm sitting.

I find this bet so strange.  The only reason you go into it is because you think there's a real strong chance of the stock ending the week above $13, right?  But you coulda just bought $12-13 debit spreads for 40 cents each.  Then if the stock ends the week at $13 or higher, you turn 30k into 75k, and if it ends at $12.40 you break even.

Like, yeah, this bet does a little better than the debit spread if the stock falls only slightly, but at the price of so much of the upside.  Basically the stock would need to hit $16 before you started making more money with this play than the debit spread.

Or, to put it another way, you coulda just bought 11-12 debit spreads for 62 cents a pop.  With those you'd actually make more profit with AMC ending the week at $12 as you would with your play and AMC ending the week at $14.",GearheadGaming,34,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mb714b/amc_20k_in_stocks_30k_in_itm_call_options/grwybyj/,0.025,0.88,0.095,0.932

Took a bit since it was confusing that UWMC business is not shown in the financials since this is the 10-K for the newly form SPAC entity and UWMC will be included going forward, hence the net income loss despite UWMC stating in the notes that they made $3.38Bn this year.

The 10-K financials reflect the newly formed entity post SPAC.

&#x200B;

Then it talks about the actual UWMC business. That is why I think what you need to do is apply the shares outstanding to the actual UWMC net income of $3.38Bn. When you do that thought, it seems very very high like you said.

So lads inflation has been steep. If you look at m1 it’s drastically steeper. Demand for goods is at a relative low, as still most restaurants are closed/limited, many supply chains are heavily disrupted, etc. Many businesses are demanding their suppliers work overtime and will pay higher prices to get goods on time, as most supply chains face heavy delays. 

Lumber prices, real estate prices are at all time highs. Oil, semiconductors, and most other commodities are racing towards all time highs. Velocity of money is picking up as reopening begins, and will continue to increase sharply. 

With all this, it seems inflation is going to be an extremely strong factor for the next several years, especially as the fed says it will not slow down QE, and Biden wants a 3 trillion dollar infrastructure bill next. We’ve increased our money supply 25% this year with no signs of slowing. 

What assets will protect me from the effects of inflation? Currently I’m heavily in REIT’s (geo and unit) as well as food staples such as KHC. Do y’all think we’re facing an inflation crisis?

They don’t put caps on your sell limits so you can set your sell at whatever you want, 250%? Okay. 20000%? Okay. And then there’s MarketPro. It gives good data and changes the UI completely.

1310,TDA," I updated. I messed up with the calculations on TDA.

Ended up double checking TDA, Schwab, TastyWorks, ETrade, Merrill Lynch and it just seems I must have slipped up on TDA. Thanks.

&#x200B;

Also, the calculation is a bit more annoying than that (Dec 2020 Option Contracts).

You get each individual average of each field: Market Orders as % of Non-Directed Orders, Marketable Limit Orders as % of NonDirected Orders, Non-Marketable Limit Orders as % of NonDirected Orders, Other Orders as % of Non-Directed Orders. Note each subgroup of them has weighed values (e.g.: 45.36 -->66.09). And apparently the subgroups don't even sum up to 100 properly so I have to divide by the sum of each column instead.

Then follow the weighed average divided by total: 2.93, 8.23, 31.46, 57.37.

&#x200B;

The $0.7188\~$0.789 is for 'Net Payment Paid/ Received for Marketable Limit Orders' which is only (31.46/99.99)% of all option contracts). (57.37/99.99)% of all options contract are 45.33\~46.56 hence the number is closer to the 50s and not 70s.

Doesn't make sense why they capped it like that but mathematically, it makes sense at same time (still wish Fidelity removed this boomer cap <it costs Fidelity money to submit order so it probably did it also to avoid losing money unnecessarily since it doesn't profit from order flow).

Exchanges have circuit breakers on individual stocks. NYSE halts a stock if 10% movement in 5 minutes for most securities. So mathematically, it makes sense that the limit order % should be fine especially if you turn on notification when prices get close to the range you want.

Once it runs, this is literally a fucking money printer.

The modded yeast eat sugar and shit out a more expensive molecule (like CBG/CBD). They already have mapped out 400+ molecules. It’s like they have a machine where if you feed it a dime, it spits out a quarter. Even a retard can understand this math.

They have the google maps for yeast and everyone else is navigating by the stars. And they patented the shit out of all the major streets so no one can follow them.
If green sustainability had a dick, it would have such a huge hard on for this company. They replace dirty chemistry with clean, sustainable, low cost, and better organic chemisty.

How did they get so fucked in the first place?
They tried biofuels but gas prices went down so they got boned and couldn't compete. They pivoted to flavors and fragrances because that stuff is worth more per kilogram than fuel. So they rested there like a wounded animal while still dumping 70M into RnD yearly. And now bankruptcy is off the table. Their consumer brands are taking off and they are rising like a goddamn yeast phoenix. It cost them 2B to get to this point.

-13 molecules at commercial scale and 18 in the pipeline. They can take any molecule to commercial scale in under a year.

-they are making a protein platform, beyond meat and impossible foods better watch out.

-they can claim ""all natural"" on all their products

-The golden goose tendie machine - yeast map

-vaccine play - they produce squalene which is used as an adjuvant to boost vaccine efficacy. It also saves millions of sharks from being killed

-they teamed up with IDRI to create a 2nd gen vaccine an SA-mRNA vaccine that can be stored room temp for 8months, longer if kept cold.

-they worked with DARPA living foundries program to develop their machine learning

-they make sustainable jetfuel with the Navy

-they are working on a monoclonal antibody platform, no more twiddling hamster ovaries

-also HMO (titty milk sugars) platform, and an mRNA (printing vaccine antigen) platform.

-they have created next gen sweeteners which will help our fat asses consume less sugar without the fake taste. and they are partnering with Raizen on it

-they are a cannabis play - they produce CBD and CBG at commercial scale (there is a lawsuit but it looks frivolous, just look up the lawyers on both sides. Amy is going to be fine)

-Its P/S multiple is around 10-15x and similar companies have 100x.

-its only 3B mcap. This thing can run.

-5 years ahead of competitors

Part 2

And for you monkeys that are having FOMO, we’re just getting started on our trip to Tendie Town... allow me to explain.


500M dollar protein platform deal expected to close before the end of March
-It’s only a ~5B dollar company, we’re all retarded here but that one single deal compared to the companies entire valuation is easy fucking tendies boys. 

-It's a plant protein platform. Like what Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods does but better. Amyris has perfected yeast, they will be able to be more cost effective.

-This is just a single branch of their company. Think of Amyris as a BYND that can make any molecule found in nature - not just proteins.  

-mRNA platform and mAB platform

-Both of these platforms are set to come up later this year and be more active early 2022.

-mRNA platform - they already have the best adjuvant that can make vaccines last 8 months at room temperatures. To take it a step further, they are in progress of being able to print out mRNA. This would be massive in cutting costs and also making an absurd amount of vaccines in a short amount of time. We’d be sort of pandemic proof. 

-mAB platform - monoclonal antibodies are like artificial antibodies that can be programmed to target cancers. Extremely valuable but a bitch to produce with current methods (you have to twiddle some hamster ovaries)

-There is no need to do any inventing or research to develop mRNA or mABs, that is what Amyris’ customers do. Amy just mods the yeast to pump this shit out.

Amy is the kind of girl that doesn't forget to play with your balls while she is blowing up your account with the Gluck Gluck 9000. That is the kind of girl you keep around. Amyris is the 10 Year Tendie Play. I’m going to be here for a while, you’re going to see more and more of my gains. 


You know how you wished to get into TSLA when it was smaller? Here is your chance. It is a company with even more potential and a better impact on the environment. I only covered three branches of this company. How many more branches are you going to let slap you in the face until you realize this is an amazing buy at any price.





Part 3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




~500M of deals will close for Amyris around the end of the month. I know this because I am on every conference call or presentation they give. I don't believe the market has priced this in because Amy is still relatively unknown. So if you ever wanted to become a Yeast Bro or (if you have the monies) a Yeast Beast… do your DD and consider this stock.

And by popular request from the comments…

The Bad Stuff and why you shouldn't buy this stock

-881M lawsuit by Lavvan, read it yourselves and form your own opinions. I saw that John Doerr added way more knowing all of this and so are many institutions. So I am not too worried. (This shows you how valuable that yeast is)

-Capacity capacity capacity. Their current plant is already maxed out and they are working on another one. They need this second plant to come up without any interruption so that they can continue with their future projections. If there are any stalls, this would be a problem because each plant costs 70M and can return 200-400M per year in revenue.

-It has I think ~100-150M in debt. I think they are planning to pay 50M towards it this year

Part 2

And for you monkeys that are having FOMO, we’re just getting started on our trip to Tendie Town... allow me to explain.


500M dollar protein platform deal expected to close before the end of March
-It’s only a ~5B dollar company, we’re all retarded here but that one single deal compared to the companies entire valuation is easy fucking tendies boys. 

-It's a plant protein platform. Like what Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods does but better. Amyris has perfected yeast, they will be able to be more cost effective.

-This is just a single branch of their company. Think of Amyris as a BYND that can make any molecule found in nature - not just proteins.  

-mRNA platform and mAB platform

-Both of these platforms are set to come up later this year and be more active early 2022.

-mRNA platform - they already have the best adjuvant that can make vaccines last 8 months at room temperatures. To take it a step further, they are in progress of being able to print out mRNA. This would be massive in cutting costs and also making an absurd amount of vaccines in a short amount of time. We’d be sort of pandemic proof. 

-mAB platform - monoclonal antibodies are like artificial antibodies that can be programmed to target cancers. Extremely valuable but a bitch to produce with current methods (you have to twiddle some hamster ovaries)

-There is no need to do any inventing or research to develop mRNA or mABs, that is what Amyris’ customers do. Amy just mods the yeast to pump this shit out.

Amy is the kind of girl that doesn't forget to play with your balls while she is blowing up your account with the Gluck Gluck 9000. That is the kind of girl you keep around. Amyris is the 10 Year Tendie Play. I’m going to be here for a while, you’re going to see more and more of my gains. 


You know how you wished to get into TSLA when it was smaller? Here is your chance. It is a company with even more potential and a better impact on the environment. I only covered three branches of this company. How many more branches are you going to let slap you in the face until you realize this is an amazing buy at any price.





Part 3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




~500M of deals will close for Amyris around the end of the month. I know this because I am on every conference call or presentation they give. I don't believe the market has priced this in because Amy is still relatively unknown. So if you ever wanted to become a Yeast Bro or (if you have the monies) a Yeast Beast… do your DD and consider this stock.

And by popular request from the comments…

The Bad Stuff and why you shouldn't buy this stock

-881M lawsuit by Lavvan, read it yourselves and form your own opinions. I saw that John Doerr added way more knowing all of this and so are many institutions. So I am not too worried. (This shows you how valuable that yeast is)

-Capacity capacity capacity. Their current plant is already maxed out and they are working on another one. They need this second plant to come up without any interruption so that they can continue with their future projections. If there are any stalls, this would be a problem because each plant costs 70M and can return 200-400M per year in revenue.

-It has I think ~100-150M in debt. I think they are planning to pay 50M towards it this year

1419,TSLA," *None of what I say is financial advice, and you shouldn’t trust a random guy on the internet… but I hear you are looking for tendies - if you follow me to my van, I can show you where you might find some.


Amyris Tldr; They have used machine learning and AI to solve/map genetic pathways in yeast to create almost any molecule at production scale. I believe that the price could hit 2k-4k per share one day


Once it runs, this is literally a fucking money printer.

The modded yeast eat sugar and shit out a more expensive molecule (like CBG/CBD). They already have mapped out 400+ molecules. It’s like they have a machine where if you feed it a dime, it spits out a quarter. Even a retard can understand this math.

They have the google maps for yeast and everyone else is navigating by the stars. And they patented the shit out of all the major streets so no one can follow them.
If green sustainability had a dick, it would have such a huge hard on for this company. They replace dirty chemistry with clean, sustainable, low cost, and better organic chemisty.

How did they get so fucked in the first place?
They tried biofuels but gas prices went down so they got boned and couldn't compete. They pivoted to flavors and fragrances because that stuff is worth more per kilogram than fuel. So they rested there like a wounded animal while still dumping 70M into RnD yearly. And now bankruptcy is off the table. Their consumer brands are taking off and they are rising like a goddamn yeast phoenix. It cost them 2B to get to this point.

Why should you buy? - Pick from the list below. I know you've put your money in tickers with less potential.They are a part of BioMade which is the U.S. initiative for a syntheic bio industrial revolution. Think about it, fermentation plants across the U.S. and it becomes the largest chemical/raw materials exporter.

-13 molecules at commercial scale and 18 in the pipeline. They can take any molecule to commercial scale in under a year.

-they are making a protein platform, beyond meat and impossible foods better watch out.

-they can claim ""all natural"" on all their products

-The golden goose tendie machine - yeast map

-vaccine play - they produce squalene which is used as an adjuvant to boost vaccine efficacy. It also saves millions of sharks from being killed

-they teamed up with IDRI to create a 2nd gen vaccine an SA-mRNA vaccine that can be stored room temp for 8months, longer if kept cold.

-they worked with DARPA living foundries program to develop their machine learning

-they make sustainable jetfuel with the Navy

-they are working on a monoclonal antibody platform, no more twiddling hamster ovaries

-also HMO (titty milk sugars) platform, and an mRNA (printing vaccine antigen) platform.

-they have created next gen sweeteners which will help our fat asses consume less sugar without the fake taste. and they are partnering with Raizen on it

-they are a cannabis play - they produce CBD and CBG at commercial scale (there is a lawsuit but it looks frivolous, just look up the lawyers on both sides. Amy is going to be fine)

1425,MX," 1. Oled has been here for a while in phones. Most phones in the mid-range+ contain Oled.

2. High-end TVs already have Oled and are getting cheaper each year.

The next move is Micro-led, which is only currently in a 2 Flagship TVs, 1 from Samsung and 1 from LG. That being said I think the potential is still there for MX to grow, just not as long as you think (unless their DDIC can be used in Micro-led later). As of right now, there is still growth in cheaper TVs moving to Oled as well as computer monitors adopting Oled.",Moh_Jay,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbhb2a/best_oled5g_value_play_mx_magnachip_makes_oled/grygdvo/,0.0,0.938,0.062,0.6249

OLED is great tech but with certain drawbacks. The next gen tech is already at play, called microLED, I think spearheaded by Samsung and Sony.

Profits are fixed by the gov't. LMT can only make so much profit. Period. The way that they increase the dividend and stock price is by fucking over the employees which leads to high turnover, lack of retention, and soon collapse from being what it was. They have been gutting the benefits like you wouldn't believe. Refusing to promote people when they damn well deserve it. The only way to get promoted is to say ""I'm done, I'll start applying else where"" and then magically they will work something out. Plus, they will soon be a shell of themselves due to equality, diversity, and high turnover. Due to recent equality/diversity preaching and gov't mandates, LMT has gone FULL WOKE and will not higher white males. It's actually getting difficult for white females to be hired in. So instead they hire people of diversity. (No, I am not a bigot who judges people by skin color) The trouble is, that for whatever reason, they are hiring the least qualified or laziest people of diversity. They just sit on charge codes and do nothing, which is a serious offence to the gov't as this is miss-charging. (gov't hates it when you take tax payer money from them) To circumvent this managers can hire temporary work force through contracting houses. There are no HR/equality/diversity requirements for bringing in ""temporary workforce."" The majority of young white males who work their ass off within LMT are contractors. Contractors get paid for every minute of overtime they work (only straight time though, no 1.5X or 2X). LMT people must ""donate"" the first 5 hours past 40 and then be approved for comp time up to a maximum of 60. It's a huge process for overtime to get approved so it rarely happens and the contractors get to work all they want. The high turnover comes into play as you can't progress far into lead roles as a contractor, so you move on the next gig. High-turnover means always training new people on a program, never retaining people to become SMEs (system matter experts), and lack of proper program growth/development since no ones knows the past or present of the program in it's entirety. So, with people miss-charging and doing nothing, contractors working all sorts of overtime to make up the slack but don't get to move up, fixed profit margins, and high turnover; LMT is soon to be doomed by it's own doing.

**An incredible 23 buys from $9 million to $674 million.**

**Truly amazing and very abnormal/unusual. Things that make you go hmm.**

**I have noticed an EXTREMELY CRAZY dollar amount of BLOCK TRADES in this stock recently (March 2021).**

A block trade is a very large SINGLE trade, typically worth $200,000 or more in market value. Pension funds, institutional money, hedge funds, millionaires/billionaires and banks use them to make big trades without impacting the market with numerous trades.

&#x200B;

Institutional money has some of the BIGGEST diamond hands ever and **they are seemingly continuing to buy up shares and hold, another reason you continue to see VIAC have a strong monthly uptrend or chart.**

**( diamond hands = strong, smart investors in it for the long-term, who don't panic easily)**

I work in the alcohol industry and sell both wine and beer. I have a couple concerns for NAPA tho. 

The wine market is incredibly over saturated. Duckhorn has recognition which helps but wine drinkers are very promiscuous. A lot of their repeat business is going to come in the on-premise where I predict will never be the same. 

Them missing they sales number is concerning as well since beer and liquor suppliers all had record years. This indicates that they are too reliant for on-premise sales or consumers traded down in 2020 to less premium wines. 

I think NAPA is a phenomenal company, but I just do not think I could throw my money into a wine company in this market.",HuckleberryFinn7777,13,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mayn5g/napa_duckhorn_portfolio_inc_dd/grv829i/,0.038,0.878,0.084,0.5439

The wine market is incredibly over saturated. Duckhorn has recognition which helps but wine drinkers are very promiscuous. A lot of their repeat business is going to come in the on-premise where I predict will never be the same. 

Them missing they sales number is concerning as well since beer and liquor suppliers all had record years. This indicates that they are too reliant for on-premise sales or consumers traded down in 2020 to less premium wines. 

I think NAPA is a phenomenal company, but I just do not think I could throw my money into a wine company in this market.",HuckleberryFinn7777,13,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mayn5g/napa_duckhorn_portfolio_inc_dd/grv829i/,0.038,0.878,0.084,0.5439

Also they might not be making a lot or as many orders but they **will** still be making orders and Rolls Royce is still a top competitor in the turbofan market.

Also in the next year or two we will likely see a rise of electric engines like what we are currently seeing happen with the automotive industry - planes are just a bigger beast and will take a bit more time to get there.

It's just nasty.

Now, I want to you to keep in mind that I used to have Sirius in my previous car.  I had the dash moved around so I could sling in one of the pluggable receivers.  I drilled a hole through the block wall of my home office so I could lay the satellite receiver outside and listen while working.  I bought an additional cradle so I could listen from work.  I used to have it on all the time.  Then it got worse and worse as they added channels, particularly too many from XM.  Of the two cars in the house I think one of them has Sirius... don't care.

It was when they added Sirius Backseat Video that it went straight to hell.  Satellite has limited bandwidth with a zero sum game, and if you add channels and video you have to take it from somewhere, and that somewhere was everywhere.

Meanwhile literally any streaming service is cheaper and better, and doesn't have advertisements.

Ford announced that their vehicles are going to come with less features due to the shortage. So either cheaper price tag on the vehicles, or they are keeping the prices the same, which then give manufacturers a bigger return.

This is one of the reasons why Nvidia, AMD, and Intel are struggling to push out their latest and greatest GPUs and CPUs, and why Sony and MS are struggling to push out consoles.

One thing corporate learned from COVID has been work remote so why should they up their spending on corporate travel now they know they can get by without? It’s a huge margin saving for a lot of businesses.  
The liberal opening, spring break and the extremists denying the vaccine are potentially jeopardising the projection for immunity IMO. The slow vaccination we’ve seen in the EU and minor easing is why we now see alarming signals for wave 3.
