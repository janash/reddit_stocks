1,ZOM," Well in my limited experience there’s two things you can do at this point:

Log out and delete the apps for a while. Seriously, give it a week or so and then come back. Focus on something that doesn’t cause you stress for a while. 

Or

Dump all your shit, pick something new, hope to the gods that you’re making the right choice but more than likely you’re going to dump something that would have made you money in the longer run. 

Example?  Ok. ZOM. I had 5000 shares I bought at $.06 ea. I got frustrated with them not making money so I sold them all at $.10.

7,DD," Honestly, I am pretty spread out over a couple different platforms and intentionally used different strategies to test the waters.  I'm up 50% on one, 25% on another and down 25% on the third.  I'm still in the learning process but I feel like I am weathering the storm pretty well and am fortunate for that.

The noticeable difference between the portfolios in green and red to me is that the ones that are green are stocks that I believe in long term, even if I expected returns in the short term that didn't pan out.  Its much easier to hold through white knuckle days when you believe in the stock in 2-3 years because you just get tempted to buy and lower your average instead of feeling like the roof is caving in.  I did this, and then ENTX, for example, popped off, even in a down market, proving that the theory at least some times works.

My -25% was riskier investments to begin with so I'm just not checking as often and pretending everything is okay.  Either I lose my investment and learn a hard lesson about risk or wake up one day 5 years from now and realize I hit it.

TLDR; breathe.  Invest in shit you believe in down the road.  Go outside and don't let red charts fuck up your quality of life.  This is a lesson for the importance of DD and long term goals when you're buying in the future.

50,DD," Well for the fact youve outlined the action plan id say yea it can be done. Question is will it happen and will you make the right picks with your initial investment. This is where DD is of the utmost importance. 

I took $5 to $1500 And $200 to almost $10k. It was mostly timing and hype. (Memestock/pennystock) played them congruent. Moved gains from one to the other and piggy back tf out of all the momentum. (So yea little to no invest and big gain turn out is very possible) 

Personally, i wouldnt mess w a stock thats sub a penny. Sounds like a whole waste. IMO and i am not a pro at all. Lowest id play w is $1-2. Highest ive ever bought was like 300+ ps. My optimal ranged is between $5-15 now that i have significantly more capital.

61,GDP," Brazil has a bigger mess on their hands, as they spent a lot already without actually doing much to stop the spread of COVID-19. So now they already spent to keep the economy going while they still have major health issues to deal with.

FWIW, the US has spent $5.1T so far ($100B, $2.2T, $900B, and $1.9T) on stimulus packages, but the GDP is 21T. So we've spent a lot, but it is 24%, not 65%. And I think Brazil isn't a great comparison, so hopefully that isn't a major concern.

I'll note that I could see them raising rates before 2024, but a) they don't have to make that call now, and b) I don't think it should have a huge impact on the market if they did. I don't get it...

The “first” DD posts for AITX also recommended at least 1-2 years so I know for AITX it’s going to be a while which includes SSFT. HITIF is in its own league where it’s a legitimate business, it’s continually to expand, actually has a product that isn’t waiting for some approval or contract, and has presence in the US.

176,DD," I've looked into the financial reports of Castor Maritime and a competing dry-bulk company Star bulk: [https://www.starbulk.com/](https://www.starbulk.com/).

Star-bulk operates with over 100 vessels currenly and posted a revenue of \~$800,000 last year. Star-bulks share price is currently sitting at $15 a share with a market cap of over a billion. Castor maritime is operating with a fraction of the fleet, has posted a revenue of over $3,000,000 in their 2019 earnings report, and a revenue of over $7,400,000 million in 2020.

184,RS," Of course :) So in an RS, the company decides to consolidate its shares and reduce its float, that is the total number of shares outstanding. When the happens, the total number of shares goes down, but the value of each share goes up proportionally. In a 10/1 RS, one share gains the value of ten. In a 5/1, one share gains the value of 5, and so on. In general, RSs are interpreted as signs of failing companies who don’t want to get delisted. However, for companies who have a large enough float, it can be a good move to retire a good number of the shares in pursuit of something like an uplisting. FOMO currently has a float of 10bil shares (massive and a holdover from the convertible debt of the 2050 Motors days) and would benefit as a company in the long term likely by undergoing an RS, especially once they show decent enough revenue not to cause a panic sale when the company says they will go through with an RS.

195,AR," Has anyone here noted Bublar Group? Or how easy it is to buy that from the small list outside of Nordics?

Bublar Group is a Swedish AR/VR/VFX/Mobile Game company that has many different business segments, but with most interesting thing: soon to be released Hello Kitty AR game [AR Kawaii](https://www.hellokittykawaiiworld.com/)
It’s was supposed to be released last year in addition of Tokyo Olympics but was postponed to 2021 due to Covid19 situation (it’s a location based game after all)

Hello Kitty is 2nd most valued media franchise just after Pokemon https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_media_franchises 
So there really is potential on the market. 

Company is listed in Stockholm Nasdaq First North and is very low valued <50m$. Hello Kitty game should come out in following 4months (before Olympics)

Personally I’ve followed this company about 1,5 years and have owned it approx 1 year, buying still more now and then.

They also have more stuff coming regarding mobile games in near future [Bublar Group press releases](https://bublar.com/press/press-releases/#/)

Any thoughts? Has anyone bumped to this company before? Or is this never mentioned stuff here? I personally think that <50m$ is cheap if you think possibilities for media brand like Hello Kitty, risk vs. Reward.",Friendly_Goat6357,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/m6r1v7/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gr7s8ol/,0.037,0.853,0.11,0.9574

236,SENS," I've really tried to like SENS since I'm T1D, but I just can't get behind the current thesis.

The implantable sensor I think is going to be a bit of a hard sell even at 180 days or more (I don't see any reason to do it for less when Dexcom and comps are so quick and easy to install). And I think I've got a bit of conflicting thoughts on it because I wouldn't consider getting an implantable sensor unless it was long-term, but with it being long-term I also wonder about issues with placement. If you put the sensor in a spot that you end up not liking, you're stuck with it for the next 180 days. If I put my Dexcom CGM too low on my arm and its getting caught up on my sleeve as an example, it's mostly a minor inconvenience for the few days it's on. Worst case, it pulls itself off and I have to call Dexcom for a replacement. 

But my bigger concern than selling the implantable sensor as a benefit is the lack of anything that I've seen about any work on getting their sensors working with an insulin pump in a closed loop system. I wear a Dexcom CGM and have a Tandem insulin pump, so the data from the CGM is fed directly to the pump. This helps the pump regulate your baseline insulin levels. More and more pumps and CGM systems are going to this and I'm concerned that I haven't seen anything to indicate that this is even being discussed for the Eversense system. Without that, I don't think there's anything there. I would be more optimistic if I saw anything indicating that it might come in the future, but I just don't. Until that gets worked out, I just don't see a single T1D on a closed loop system dropping that for an Eversense system regardless of how it stacks up solely as a CGM. 

I'm still watching the company and haven't written them off completely, but I think there's more than a few good reasons for the short interest.",UnarmedJuice,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/m786ss/sens_the_numbers_speak_for_themselves/gr9tcio/,0.063,0.862,0.076,0.6942

Company has contracted with a major nutraceutical manufacturer to produce its initial production lot of Halberd’s VITA-SHIELD-MAXTM Immune Booster.  Halberd’s scientists designed this proprietary combination of vitamins and minerals to help the body increase its natural immunity and promote general health.

*It's just a supplement combining existing ingredients.*

I can't find any scientific information for the Antibody Against Sars-Covid-19 Spike protein. Having trademarks and patents is fine but immunotherapy has to go through a process with the FDA or equivalent elsewhere in the world.

***Please would someone provide a link for the detailed scientific information***

This looks interesting but pobably a very long term play. It's only a $2m cap which is tiny. I'd like to be convinced.

It might gain some traction being that it’s share value is only a couple of bucks and that will seem like chump change to people looking to invest their stimulus checks. I still don’t expect any gains above $2.50 to hold long term unless they announce some new products.

Truforma sounds pretty cool with its potential for expediting diagnoses, but from my understanding it is used for diagnosing slow growing ailments, which means that waiting a few days for lab results won’t make much of a difference in treatment. 

Of course, this doesn’t mean Zomedica isn’t on the verge of something truly revolutionary, but for now I think they’re tapped out in true value. I’m still holding 1k shares from when I thought Truforma would make this thing rocket, but I don’t expect to see above $3 anytime soon.

293,DD, Lol you're not bothering anyone homie.  I was saying I also wanted to know the answer to your question. I looked at the DD and quickly decided it wasn't for me.

Usually like defense stocks like RTX (Raytheon), cyclical stocks like F (Ford), and some others that are pricey at the moment. Do your research on say top 10 stocks that pay the highest dividend and start there.
