When you BUY to CLOSE a covered call to realize profits, you have to pay back your premium. So when you closed your covered call for 615 profit, you had to pay back 15 because you were credited 630.",Spockies,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/mcr25p/closing_out_covered_calls_and_premium_credit/gs5h396/,0.043,0.793,0.165,0.8402
2,BP," You were paid the premium when you sold the call. To close it (and realise the profit) you had to buy it back. 

Sell another one and you’ll see your BP increase again.

3,CC, When you sold the CC you received the $630 in premium immediately into your buying power. When you bought to close you had to pay the premium for the new contract which was $15. You don’t actually gain money on the option after you sell it. The reason it looked like you had gained $615 is because the premium for an identical contract had dropped by that amount from when you originally sold it meaning that was the amount you would be net positive if you were to close the position compared to before you sold the contract.,calvinist22,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/mcr25p/closing_out_covered_calls_and_premium_credit/gs5n3j6/,0.013,0.873,0.114,0.8934
