0,AM," I block out 99% of all market news. The other 1% are the current prices and financial info bbut that’s it and I’m doing okay.

I’ve come the conclusion that most people have no idea what their doing albeit they THINK what they know what their doing. If some keeps screaming MARKET CRASH and it doesn’t happen the. They can say, “well it WILL happen just not right now” and when it does happen they will scream “SEE, I WAS RIGHT! I AM VERY SMART INDIVIDUAL ‘CAUSE I PREDICATED THIS!”

Same method that people who predict the end of the world news.

19,AI, The Fed isn't the only manipulation happening in the market. AI trading is also a huge issue hedgefunds use to manipulate share prices to get the market reaction they want to increase profits.

20,UK," Yes! Everywhere that is not the US, EU, Japan, UK, Canada, Australia, and Switzerland. China controls 2.5% of world currency reserves and has 15%+ of its population so it is not the worst hit, the ratio of reserves to population gets worse from there. 

Think of it this way: we have 7 billion people who essentially live hand to mouth and need to work to feed themselves outside of the aforementioned nuclear umbrella. When we print USD / etc, the price of food goes from 10 cents to 20 cents or whatever that is over there. They have no choice but to keep working making widgets and raw materials for the factories (or working in the factories) that supply the US et al with cheap consumer goods (by our standards). 

When the price of a burger in the US rises 10 cents the increase is nominally minimal, when the price of a loaf of bread in India or Pakistan or Egypt or Indonesia increases by a third or doubles (that same 10 cent increase), the increase is quite significant, possibly results in political unrest, but also means that their wage slave populations (I am not talking about their elites who generally have bank accounts in USD etc as well) need to keep slaving away because there is literally no alternative for them to afford bread (or rice). This is terrible but it is how the system works.",developmentfiend,1,/r/stocks/comments/oexbo3/is_anyone_else_sick_and_tired_of_seeing_all_the/h49i6ix/,0.052,0.897,0.051,-0.0914
21,GDP," I think your argument has significant merit and makes sense from a purely mathematically standpoint.

However, the counterargument is PPP--purchasing power parity, which dictates that prices in other countries are lower relative to US/EU/Japan et al. 

In fact as you know there's two ways to measure GDP: PPP vs nominal GDP.  Many economies, including China, appear larger from the PPP standpoint.  My understanding is that while Nominal GDP is more important when it comes to global power projection, PPP is a reflection of a country's internal economy.  It dictates by definition that the ""10 cent"" to which you refer isn't directly translated to a ""10 cent"" increase in the third world, but rather a proportional increase, which, while still difficult for them, is not as bad as literally exchanging 10 cents for their native currency and measuring the loss of capital in those exact 1:1 terms.

142,INTC," Nothing too technical or a complex trading strategy but I have been working in Finance for over 15 years so I have a bit of experience.

Essentially I follow 20-30 stocks like a hawk, adding and removing stocks from this list. I know these companies in and out. Then I wait for a dislocation in the stock and or a sell off in the market. Once this happens I buy call LEAPs at least one to two years out, waiting for mean reversion and or whatever catalyst I believe takes place. Most importantly, I trim gains along the way up by setting specific targets. Thus at 20% gain I sell X amount of position, 50% x amount of position etc etc. This protects my gains even though does limit a bit of my upside but found this to be important in locking in gains before they all erode. Especially in options. IE earlier this year CEO of VWM left for INTC, VMW was crushed by over 15% for a stock that barely moves. That was an easy play knowing there was a dislocation and the stock soldoff based on their CEO leaving which really didn't matter since the company is essentially controlled by Dell. Then I bought calls on VMW, stock went back to previous levels and I trimmed at 40% and 70% initially then let the rest ride. Ended up closing my position a few weeks later for a bit over 60% gain in about 3 months by using target goals I set myself for each position and play.

Doesn't mean I am always invested all the time, I patiently wait for the right opportunities but do sit in higher cash position than most before striking. Currently 40% cash as markets are a bit frothy.

It's only a couple of percent at worst in the UK once you account for having to pay it twice for a full trade (buy and sell). 

It's up to you how much you withdraw. If you only want to pull profits or original investment (original investment means no tax) just work out what that is and sell it. 

From what I can read into this you seem to be focussed on tax implications especially as you want to invest in property. 

Just remember it doesn't really matter when it comes to more stocks if you invest what would be taxes at the time as any losses come off your taxes anyway and stocks are easily liquidated. Just be sure that whatever you invest in property on top you put a bit more than your tax percentage (say 40% based on your figures) somewhere you can't make losses that's safe.

185,AAPL," Let’s say you bought a few odd lots of AAPL about twenty-odd years ago. When they reinstated the dividend, you reinvested those back in aapl and bought a few more odd lots from 2011-2013, like a few thousand dollars for 5-6 shares every time the sawtooth action dipped below a certain level. You end up with a portfolio, maybe $3M of which is in AAPL in Sep 2020. You decide to diversify into real estate, because every house you look at is bought in days and you don’t want to live in a rented townhouse forever (or so your spouse tells you), but not buy outright because you can pay off a 2% mortgage for quite a while and you think Apple can outpace that.

Now, do you sell your original odd lots, which by now are thousands of shares? Each share has appreciated by about 100000%. The only thing you wouldn’t be paying capital gains on is maybe $0.15, $0.20. So basically, each share you sell at $110 is going to cost you $25+ in capital gains taxes to the IRS, and capital gains are taxed as ordinary income at the margin in California so maybe another $13-$14 to the tax franchise board.

Or you can sell the ones that are only up a few hundred percent and maybe pay only $15 in federal cap gains and $10 in state ordinary gains.

So your choice is, sell for $110 and pay about $40 per share to the various governments? Or sell for $110 and pay about $25 per share? Remember, average home prices shot up last year, and California Bay Area single family houses averaged just under a million. So call it a round $200000 for an average down payment, plus extra to pay off the taxes. How much extra? Well, divide that by $110 per share and you’ll have to sell about 1820 shares for the down payment alone. Would you rather be paying $75000 extra in taxes, or $45000 in taxes? If you’re selling shares to pay off taxes as well, remember that every extra share adds to the taxable number.

Where it cost $140,000 to rebuild or replace a simple piston engine. Very expensive mechanics. Not only that if you take your car to the shop the mechanic can just Google or look at the manufactures, portal for repairs for any questions he might not know, and I  worked at a mechanical for a q few years this happens ALOT.  these are wealths of knolwage built up for each car I over years. When there is only one plane in the fucking world you need to keep your mechanics to have a working knowledge of the plane or it dies very inconvenient. More so than all this. Is every part in that plane that was a one off part. Has huge costs behind it to replace It. thats why viable airlines are still using 747 and other 50 year old plane designs becuse maintenance is the #1 cost for air line fuel only cost about 15%.

Likewise, their reentry technique only works because the spacecraft is traveling at low velocities, and it won't work for orbital flight either.

240,BP," # Wall Street Breakfast: Crisis For OPEC+

> Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates headed into the boxing ring for another round on Monday, before OPEC+ called it quits on a production deal. The unresolved spat between the long-time allies saw WTI crude soar another 2% to near $77/bbl, further squeezing an already tight oil market and raising concerns over inflation. At issue is the current terms of ""baselines,"" or the measure in which each country calculates its production cuts. The UAE feels its current level of 3.2M bpd from April 2020 is too low - and should be 3.8M bpd when the deal is extended into 2022 - but the Saudis and Russia have rejected any readjustments, fearing that other OPEC members will issue similar demands.

> What's at stake? Abu Dhabi is attempting to force the group to accept its request or risk unraveling the alliance. At the extremes of the equation, crude prices could make an outsized move in either direction. Failure to reach a deal could mean crude could rise even higher, but OPEC+ unity may also break down, risking a free-for-all that could send prices crashing. That scenario played out last year when a disagreement between Saudi Arabia and Russia prompted an oil price war. Months after the dispute was settled, the UAE stirred things up again by threatening to leave the cartel. 

**China crackdown**

> Shares of DiDi Global (DIDI) are off 25% premarket to $11.60 as trading reopened after the July 4 holiday weekend. That's also 17% below DiDi's IPO price of $14, though many retail investors likely bought in a lot higher. Triggering the plunge was a Big Data crackdown by Beijing, which ordered U.S.-listed Chinese companies to be removed from app stores worldwide. While existing users can still use the apps, new subscribers have been halted while the Chinese probes are conducted.

> DiDi said the app takedown in China ""may have an adverse impact on its revenue in China,"" but is striving to ""rectify any problems, improve its risk prevention awareness and protect users' privacy and data security."" Also off in premarket action are truck-hailing service Full Truck Alliance Co. (YMM) an online recruiting app Kanzhun (BZ), which are down 16% and 9%, respectively. Both companies went public in the U.S. in June.

> Bigger picture: Fearful of their growing influence, China is in the middle of a sweeping crackdown on the nation's biggest tech firms. Last November, Beijing pulled the planned IPO of fintech giant Ant Group, and in April, it hit Alibaba (BABA) with a record $2.8B fine over abusing its market dominance. In May, China's antitrust regulator also ordered DiDi and nine other on-demand transport companies to overhaul their practices ranging from price hikes to driver treatment. 

**At record highs**

> Futures linked to the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq are hanging close to the flatline following a big week for the major averages, which notched fresh record highs in the wake of the U.S. jobs report. Nonfarm payrolls for June showed a strong gain of 850K on Friday, but there appeared to be enough concerns to keep the Fed from tapering its bond purchases (for now). While many expect the stock market gains to continue into the second half of 2020, others are more cautious.

> Analyst commentary: ""The U.S. economy is booming, but this is now a known and asset markets reflect it. What isn't so clear anymore is at what price this growth will accrue,"" said Michael Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley. ""Higher costs mean lower profits, another reason why the overall equity market has been narrowing. Equity markets are likely to take a break this summer as things heat up.""

> Traders are also preparing for a potentially more hawkish tilt at the Federal Reserve. Minutes from the FOMC tomorrow could give some clues on the direction of monetary policy, as well as the tapering timeline. Besides the behind-the-scenes discussions, many speculate additional remarks on QE and bond-buying could come at Jackson Hole in August.

**Effectiveness against Delta**

> Rising coronavirus cases in Israel, where much of the population is inoculated with the Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) vaccine, suggests the jab may be less effective in preventing mild illness from the Delta variant. However, it's still ""too early to precisely assess vaccine effectiveness,"" according to Ran Balicer, chairman of Israel's national expert panel on COVID-19. This is because exposure to the variant and the likelihood of being tested are not evenly distributed across the population, while there are still overall low number of cases among fully vaccinated Israelis.

241,WTI," # Wall Street Breakfast: Crisis For OPEC+

> Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates headed into the boxing ring for another round on Monday, before OPEC+ called it quits on a production deal. The unresolved spat between the long-time allies saw WTI crude soar another 2% to near $77/bbl, further squeezing an already tight oil market and raising concerns over inflation. At issue is the current terms of ""baselines,"" or the measure in which each country calculates its production cuts.

They had lost their dominance in the server space to Linux based systems running OSS.

Microsoft was basically living off dominance in one product in an era were we were moving from desktop computing to mobile.

If you set up an online account for the UTMA (you need the UTMA account number from a statement) you can transfer the shares to a new computershare account online in only your name if you are no longer a minor. I wasn’t able to sell them but could transfer them. Make sure you save a cost basis statement from the UTMA account. 

The paperwork seemed like a nightmare to get notarized and was odd that all that wasn’t needed if you did a transfer online. 

Once the shares transfer, you can call your brokerage firm and they can help you initiate the transfer from computershare. Process with Merrill took about a week since CS takes a few days to initiate and then settle. I provided Merrill with the cost basis info upon finalization of CS transfer. 

Best of luck!",PunkyTweeter,1,/r/stocks/comments/oekz5m/computershare_stock_transfer/h47e7lt/,0.049,0.768,0.184,0.9746
429,CS," If you have any statement of the original account, with the account # you won't have a need to provide the certificate(s)of stock.  Your stocks are already registered at computer share, in ""street"" form.  CS wants you to fill out the transfer form online, print it out, and get it signed and medallion stamped.  You should be able to obtain that medallion stamp where you bank at (financial institution). You can also call them as you're filling out the transfer form and they can walk you through it.

431,COWN," I have a different view on what constitutes a value trap. 

At first glance, a company that looks like a great deal now, but where the past few quarters or year are not representative of forward expectations. 

Example, COWN, a small investment bank. P/E ratio of only 3.4, seems like a great deal right? But historical performance has been lackluster and like all small investment banks/brokerages they have benefited from the surge in trading in the massive bull market and the enormous amount of IPOs, M&As, offerings, debt restructurings, etc. This increased activity, however, is not sustainable.",mcoclegendary,2,/r/stocks/comments/of3woq/an_introduction_to_value_traps/h4a53uj/,0.046,0.759,0.195,0.9423

Earnings historically are very low. IEA has L12m net income of -7m usd, so they are not profitable at the moment.

A quick look at financials shows very low margins. Eg their 70m wind farm might only be 2-3m of gross margins based on their L12m. This is before their operating expenses taking up most of the above. Plus they have 160m of long term debt.",mcoclegendary,2,/r/stocks/comments/oeyrx2/curious_about_a_great_possible_opportunity_iea/h49j4zb/,0.158,0.842,0.0,-0.8955

437,NVDA," No.. stock split isn't something complicated or can cheat. You will get 3 additional shares for each 1 that you own. If you sell at any point before those additional shares are given to you, the new owner will get those shares

Stock split does not change the market cap and therefore the value of the company. If there are any shifts before or after a split in price, that's purely based on investor psychology

In my perspective, NVDA has grown very strongly over the last few weeks. Just a feeling tells me it might decrease in price soon but since it has great outlook, the price will recover even if it does decline slightly

Since you said you are holding long, I would not consider any sale to buy back",LowTraining670,4,/r/stocks/comments/of2mnv/nvda_stock_split_best_move/h49ys7r/,0.015,0.873,0.112,0.8778
438,HTH," I think it is a common problem -- I have yet to find a broker which computes this properly.

That is why I just use my own spreadsheet. All cash transfers adjust my basis. The gain (or loss) is then the difference between value and basis. The percentage gain (or loss) is the gain divided by basis.

Now, even this approach is not fully accurate as large transfers will adjust basis enough to distort percentage gains. So, you may want to weigh basis versus time or just use average basis and adjust gains accordingly over the specific period of time.

If your brokerage allows covered calls, look at the options chains for any investments and see what the premium is for a strike that you're willing to sell at.

I usually aim about 8% above the current share price for monthly calls.  If the premium is higher than .50, I'll usually go for it.
