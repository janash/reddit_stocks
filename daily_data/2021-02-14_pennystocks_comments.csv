0,BRQS," Best advice I was given was to review each failed trade twice as many times as your successful ones. The fact is that a lot of your trades will fail, especially if you are trying to day trade, but the point is to minimize risk and find stocks that are just about to explode. I used to have no idea on how to go about doing this, but just last week I found BRQS, NOVN and GSAT that all three gave me big gains, and there were indicators early on showing it would. When the volume starts to come in, then it's time to get out the charts, watch how it reacts to vwap and which way RSI is showing. That is how I have learned how to day trade with some success. I've also watched a lot of DFV's YouTube videos and I'm trying to be more patient and look at the bigger pictures now with companies.

Again bro can you read? I'm not talking about this month. I'm talking about the initial run up from when it was .50 cents in December. I'm talking about the three days where it went from .50 cents to $2. That would have fit his criteria

&#x200B;

And the catalyst that came was a research paper done by BNGO itself that wasn't peer reviewed and ARK investments Simon stood by PACB. Long before the Genomics conference in January where they had an opportunity to explain. So because it was dead in the water for months, had a catalyst that was shakey at best from a company on the verge of bankruptcy, and had effing ARK telling the public it wasn't a big deal, the only thing I feel like would have saved the investor from selling was doing his DD and knowing that this was big shit.

&#x200B;

And thats why when it went from .50 to 1.10 I didn't sell, I bought more. I bought more at 3 - 4.20  and even $10. But the initial push would have met this criteria for a pump and dump and I would have been one of those sad users selling at $2 if I listened to this advice.

lol didn't do the DD. Thanks for the laugh. My point is, thank you OP for explaining in laymen's terms what a pump and dump is, but if you're doing your DD thats literally all that matters, and I'm really just tired of people complaining about the pump and dumps on here as if they can't think for themselves. Let them lose their money if they can't read SEC filings and are going to trust strangers on the interwebz.

&#x200B;

And as for not doing the DD, your comments clearly show you're making assumptions. You clearly either are one of the influx of new investors or just completely missed the boat if you don't remember the first few days of that mess, and then holding through the subsequent offerings that came two weeks in a row.",nksstonks,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/ljj57a/how_to_recognize_a_pump_and_dump/gnge2kk/,0.081,0.837,0.082,-0.3307

59,DD," Basically if you see a highly up voted DD, usually means too late. If you see a DD and the account is brand new or literally just spams it, avoid like the plague. If you see it in a bunch of different places on reddit, then it's probably too late.

If you find something that has decent DD, it's not a brand new account, and isn't spammed all over reddit, then it's a possibility. From there check out Stocktwits to see what people are saying, go on OTCMarket and see how it is. Check the volume, if something all of a sudden had a ton of volume in a single day, you most likely missed it. If you see that it's already raised by a >300% in the passed few months, probably too late and should avoid.

Check out the company itself, do they have anything new upcoming, are they old, etc.

118,EV," Interesting post. Thank you for sharing. The correlation between social media chatter and positive price action must be quantifiable to some degree. I wish I had the time to dive into it more. Further to your point, I think you can mitigate risk by investing in penny stocks that follow secular trends and have a good amount of chatter associated with their tickers on social media. That's why I am investing heavily in the UAV ($TAKOF, $DFLYF), precious metal segment ($AMYZF, $MNXXF, and $MLLOF) and EV/ESG segment ($CRYBF and $ALYI).

I have one question about dilution that you may know the answer to. Are there any rules for OTC stocks about when they can dilute other than that the shares have to be authorized?

I've seen people in various places claiming that a company couldn't be diluting for x reason although dilution was in fact happening. I never really believed them as it seems like dark defunct companies can pretty much do whatever they want, but always wondered if there was anything that could stop them.

EDIT: I wanted to add one thing that you didn't talk about.

The truth about OCGN is it’s either going to go to the freaking moon or it will be a painful, firey crash landing. 

Everything is currently hinging on Phase 3 trial results, and we should have at least some interim analysis by the end of this month or sometime next month. If this analysis looks good, the stock will run. Hard.

Next comes the EUA. From what I understand, it would be unprecedented for the FDA to give EUA on Phase 3 data from another country. But we’re living in unprecedented times and it seems like this is what OCGN is hoping for. Of course, the FDA could request additional trials conducted in the US before any kind of approval, but no one knows.

Like I said, I’m long. But it’s a risky time to jump into OCGN. There’s a lot of potential upside but if any of this goes sideways the stock will tank.",bluelemoncows,28,/r/pennystocks/comments/ljr0sm/ocugen_is_bound_to_pop/gnfgfd1/,0.088,0.802,0.11,0.6819

140,NEW," im with ya man, i'm holding about 500 shares around 6$ but i saw the ability of this as soon as began looking into too, its just such an obviou upgrade: if all data holds up, then the other vaccines on the market. in all aspects, its a better upgrade in manufacturing, distribution, raw material supply line, the only thing it doesn't have going for them right now is name and power, but their science board is full  of Pfizer people. i also think its not even going to be that hard to get EAU seeing as they will take anything with over 50% efficacy rating stated by the fda last summer. its a vaccine being given to millions of human beings and is already going to trials children, the fda sees all that too even if there is concrete complete phase 3 data, the fda knows millions are taking it and are fine. the only reason it will get denied by the fda is if OCUGEN hasn't set up safe manufacturing sites, they are asking for EAU which consists of proving safe efficacy and vaccine manufacturing and distribution, see as Ocugen has been moving this way for months they must have know since fall 20. so id hope they already had huge manufacturing acquisitions already of buildings and land and delivery trucks, they will have to upscale quickly in hiring as well but because it is such a widely used way to create vaccines the inactive virus there is going to be more available techs and industry equipment that's already around, unlike the mRNA production that requires specific NEW scaled up equipment and experts which are few and far between, i believe the raw material shortage is only gonna get worse for the mRNA ones.

167,HUGE," I can't seem to wrap my head around something:

I bought 1 contract of HUGE march 19th $5 call a couple days ago for $151. Unfortunately the stock tanked. Looking at the option now it says I am down 70% (value ~$45). When I manually entered these values into optionsprofitcalculator.com, it says I am nearly guaranteed a loss. My question is this - according to the website, if for whatever reason the stock spiked to $4.80 on 2/15, I would more or less break even. What I don't understand is that when I originally bought the call on 2/10, I would be in the money if the stock was $4.80 on 2/15 (or so I thought). Why is this the case?

186,ATOS," Hey all, I bought a few ATOS shares because I heard of their cancer research going well. Endoxifen is on phase 2 and is significantly lower tumor cell proliferation in 6 out of 6 patients and one person has not had recurrence in 2 years. Although most phase 2 trails have 100 to thousands of people participating. The amount of people in this trail is usually the amount found in phase 1 or phase 0 (preliminary data).

I am also concerned about their COVID side of things. Steven Quay released a type of presentation (?) in 2019 about how COVID came from a lab. This, of course, has very little backing and the website its on even states that. I saw that they mentioned alot of preliminary data for a nasal spray to COVID but the descriptions just don’t seem adequate because they provide no statistics. 

I am saying maybe pay close attention to ATOS’s work? Both COVID and breast cancer don’t seem too promising. The COVID understanding of Dr. Quay legitimately just seems scientific bad.

I generally end up seeing these posts are pumping a stock that's all done. Likely by folks that got in late. If the stock had a 2000% run in the last 30 days and is now trending down or sideways, I start researching the next one. This filters out the majority.

This is what I did with ipix and hitif. I took large positions in both last week.

I think the company has long term potential, but it’s way too volatile right now. There’s no way to tell if Friday was just early people taking profits, or if people are going to panic and start mass selling next week.

234,AFL," Fair enough. The difference between MLFB and an XFL or AFL is that they are not trying to be a competition to the nfl . Their goal is to be a developmental feeder league into the nfl. I can see this having more benefits for survivability compared to just being another outlet of entertainment. Not just to develop players, but also coachs and refs. The nfl is well awarw of mlfb, and if  this is something they like and want to promote it has the ability to be very successful. 

In terms of mlfb failing like all other leagues , u have to keep in mind sports are at a totally different lvl now then even 5 years ago. With fantasy and betting , ppl are way more willing to watch and invest in games they normally wouldnt watch. What if draftkings adds a section for mlfb ?

235,NBA," Actually u couldnt be more wrong. The sports landscape has changed drasticly with fantasty sports and betting on almost everything.  Do u know what the NBA D league is? Its essentially triple A for bball, and will pretty much be what mlfb is to the nfl. I know multiple people who watch almost every game of every team of the D league during the summer. Hell when i was dling fantasy bball 2 yrs ago i even watched a few games or had it on as bacground noise many days.  One, because they like bball and just like watching more. 2, because they are betting on the games and have a vested interest in it. And 3,  i know ppl who watch to see prospects and up and coming players , both for betting and fantasy basketball purposes. 

 The major difference seperating mlfb and all these other failed or lackluster leagues, is the fact that they will work synergystically with the nfl instead of competing with them. Will it be successful ? That is what we are betting on. If we see a completed and successful season the share price will most likely be around the $0.50 range.

I want to see a gradual rise in the trading volume of a stock, this shows rising interest which is important as trade volumes are the number one factor in price action.  Probably the most important standalone  indicator but of course you never just use one indicator. That's trading suicide. 

Fundamentals
 
My go to fundamental metrics are:
1) mkt/cap rev ratio 
2) Cash on hand Vs short term debt 
3) quarterly revenue growth rate
4) FCF 
5) EPS beat/loss history
6) % held by insiders and institutions 
7) % shares short of float
8) Number of share outstanding 

All of these relate to determining a companies expansion, solvency, management, and price action

RSI

Typically want to see the 5 day and 1M RSI below 60 before entering 

Double derivative of MACD 

Typically not available on stock screeners, I code this myself. It shows the rate of change of Moving Average convergence/divergence. I cross this with the standard MACD

Catalysts

Browse news articles on various sites, read them thoroughly to see whether it sounds amateurish or like a real companies press releases. Want to see some big news that can be backed up by tangible actions and typically want to see a follow up on that news release for demonstration that it wasn't just unjustified hype. 

Management background check

LinkedIn, Google, hell even Facebook sometimes. A company is only as good as the people who run it, and there's some serious whackjobs out there. 

Analyst Price Targets/Recommendations
 
Not something I put a lot of weight on but still if there is a consensus by 5+ analysts that a stock is a strong sell then it makes me think twice. 

Sentiments Analysis

Very important in the days of Reddit fueled hype stocks. I use my own Algos and those available online to determine chatter levels, positive/negative sentiments, rate of change in chatter, etc. Let's me know what's being talked about.

Price Action

Many penny stocks follow a similar price action. For some P&D's there's typically a second, smaller run after the first peak if there's still enough momentum left after the dump. I can make a quick swing trade by riding that.

Industry Trends/Political Influence

268,EV," Usually start with generally solid industries. Right now : green energy, marijuana, EV, entertainment(once covid restrictions eventually start being lifted you know people are gonna be going crazy to finally get out of the house - and these brick and mortar places will benefit hugely from that).

Then look at standings of the company, profits and liabilities, etc.

Any upcoming news could also be a huge boost(if it's good news) such as great quarterly statement releases, opening new stores or mergers/acquisitions.

I've personally been targeting smaller canadian marijuana companies, they're still a fairly smaller budding market and once legalization happens in the US or even more states legalize there are some of these that will end up pushing into the US market(some already have, along with some other countries markets). A lot of them have seen huge gains over the last 6 months, and wider spread legalization will continue to cause gains as their customer base increases.

269,SP," All depends on how your trying to invest.  

1.  If you want a quick flip just go through here and twitter and see what they are hyping.  Look the price action last several days (are they going up).  Look at volume today over last several days (is it going up).  If so then jump on board.  The disadvantage is you may jump on near the peak and then it dumps and you are screwed.  The advantage is it may continue to take off and you make a lot of money.  Because of this set stop losses.
2. Look for companies that are growing in nature.  If they grow (revenue) eventually the market will see it SP grows.  It won't explode but will go up over the course of months- year.

Yes, the stock is getting a lot of hype and I see most other comments saying it’s a pump and dump. The reality is that it’s purely correlated to crypto prices. After Musk’s move with the 1.5B, followed by NY Melon bank and MasterCard... you can expect a good number of institutions in the next few months will announce positions in Bitcoin. I personally am still unsure if it’s a bubble or not but regardless the floodgates have opened and with more incoming institutional money there is a high likelihood it will blow through $50k and test $100k at some point this year. SOS will be flying as long as BTC is flying so just look at it as a momentum play. I got in quite late too - around $5.50, but letting it ride. I would put in a small position and most important thing with these momentum plays is trailing stops - I use a 30% trailing stop loss on these types of picks to limit the downside and try and preserve some gains.

282,CEO," U.K listing.

Blackbird Plc (BIRD) 

Emerging Technology Company of the year 2020.

Cloud technology which allows remote editing on any browser on low bandwidth, for media and entertainment/sports companies.

It’s the way forward since Covid especially for sporting events like the Olympics etc.

Will reduce companies carbon footprints as no need to send huge teams to events, so reducing air travel, which in turn reduces costs.

They have signed up the likes of Bloomberg, U.S State Dept, Tata Communications, A+E Networks, Peloton, Gfinity, NHL, Riot Games and many more.

Bloomberg recently said in a presentation Blackbird saves them up to an hour in some of their workflows. They said, “the technology is too good to be true.”

Stephen Streater who set up company sold his last company Eidos to Larry Ellison of Oracle.

The technology must be good, as John Honeycutt Head of Media and Entertainment at Google Cloud recently joined the board.

The BOD have also got major skin in the game. Stephen Streater owns 18% of the company. The  CEO Ian Mcdonough has bought around 8% since he arrived 3 years ago. Also Gervais Williams of Miton Group owns around 20%, and Schroders 8%.

I see limited downside risk as well, as the CEO bought 2 million shares at 14.02p last April, and the new CFO paid 17.8p in October.

This will be a multi bagger over next few years as the whole industry moves to the Cloud.
 
Bargain at 19.5p, in my opinion. The likes of Avid Technology are valued at over $1 billion.

290,RS," Awesome post!  I think this applies more to more traditional and reputable stocks and companies, most of the ""other things you look for"" are inapplicable or nonexistent for many of these cheapy start ups and pennystocks that are only there to be pumped and dumped.  

But all in all you seem a little more in touch with this stuff than I am, and there can never be enough emphasis on looking at the filings, whether they be otc filings, sec filings, or sos filings, always important to look at.  In particular, I pay close attention to issued shares, when they were issued, to who, and how much.  Many of these companies seem like giant dilution machines.  Fake news, pump it up, dump it, change name, RS, rinse and repeat.  Gteh is a perfect example of one of those stocks that people here seem to be blind to.

294,DD," $ILUS is the furthest thing from a scam... And this is pretty shallow DD IMO.

I don't know what Nick's relationship was with ILUS in 2020, but that relationship is likely why he was able to pull FB Technologies (FireBug) into the shell company. Also, not sure why the old company's financial statements from 2010\~2013 would have any significance at all here... FB Technologies/FireBug are completely different from the old company.

Looking at these OLD insignificant financial statements from 2017\~2019, we can see that total fixed assets were as follows (Converted to USD)

2017: $406,806

2018: $703,468 (73% Y/Y Growth)

2019: $1,659,792 (136% Y/Y Growth)

(Total assets MUCH higher)

All before they were even remotely being recognized like they are today. All they were selling at the time was their MistNozzle and a few limited products (fire extinguishers etc..). Growing a company takes time, that's why OTC can give amazing opportunities like this one to get in on the ground floor.

The sale they made recently to the UN alone was about $100,000, in 1 sale! I'd say the UN seems like a pretty legit customer.  Heck, the company they just acquired does about $3 million annual in revenue, and this will allow FB Tech to lower their production costs while at the same time expanding production of their E-Raptor EV, which wasn't even around during these old financial statements. TVC was also purchased with cash and restricted shares. Looks like they have more cash than we thought!

\*Don't forget 1 more acquisition coming this month, and many more coming later this year!\*

They are also making the E-Raptor autonomous in combination with new partner Milanion, and are selling modified firetrucks to governments around the UK and Dubai as shown on their Twitter page.

\*Any other companies out there producing fully autonomous EV firetrucks with watermist technology?\*

If you think this is a scam, you must think $ALPP, $UBER, and $NIO are scams too?

Perhaps their financing company is a scam too?

302,DD," My numbers were converted to USD, maybe that's why? How many tangible assets would you expect a company selling water nozzles and fire extinguishers in the UK to have? 

Are you saying that the new companies being acquired for restricted shares don't expect those restricted shares to be worth quite a bit more than they are worth currently? I'm sure they are more privy to the inner workings of the company and future plans than we are. 

I would say the same about their financiers. In the link I provided before, it states that they did deep DD into FireBug's financials before agreeing to sign a multi-year financing deal with them. A financing deal that was needed to expand the business...

306,CEO," You said you used my link which is a pdf. There’s no magical currency conversion happening (and the pound does not have that much more value over the dollar. Nor is there sales number that appear or the fact the important figure in question is the tangible assets. Anyone can pretend intangibles to be anything they like especially as in all of these filings there is no breakdown or justification for them nor are any of these audited by an outside accounting firm.

I haven’t done a deep dive into every company but any company with financials that flat out contradict claims to this degree by a CEO who repeatedly has done the same thing with similar companies In the past is absolutely concerning. Promising to deliver something in the future is one thing, lying about what you claim you’ve done and doing that over and over again is another.

Big merger with high wire network:

High Wire is a global provider of managed security, professional services and commercial/industrial electrical solutions delivered exclusively through a channel sales model. High Wire’s Overwatch managed security platform-as-a-service offers organizations end-to-end protection for networks, data, endpoints and users via multiyear recurring revenue contracts in this fast-growing technology segment. In 2020, a year impacted by the COVID pandemic, High Wire produced more than $18 Million in gross revenue and an operating profit.

They will be going public through a merger with SGSI and will be aiming for NASDAQ. Wait till you hear this: their market cap is only 4 mil, while High Wire Network's revenue is 18 mil during 2020! With the COVID impact! That's insane and with the price of only 0.3873$ I don't see how this could go wrong.

The announcement by the CEO: (can be found on the High Wire Website).

""Merger Enhances Service Offerings With More Than 250 Technical Professionals On Staff

""Spectrum Global Solutions Inc. (the “Company” or “Spectrum”) (OTCQB: SGSI), a single-source provider of next-generation communications network and professional services to telecommunications and enterprise markets, announces today the Company’s entry into a definitive agreement of merger (the “Agreement”) with High Wire Networks Inc. (“High Wire”).  The closing of the transaction is subject to certain closing conditions set forth in the Agreement.""

Even if you flip burgers for a living, there's always an opportunity from the products they use to the shippers that deliver it.

411,DD," People here say they do the DD and reduce their loss rate. 
So i am on the fence on how much DD can cover your loss rate.
People with less than 20% loss rate are turning 10k into 100k in 1 year which is insane.
But again i have no clue about all this cause my gains are so small. Under 100 $",Special_Beefsandwich,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/ljms5p/success_vs_failure_rate_on_penny_stocks/gndzt95/,0.176,0.789,0.036,-0.8126
412,DD," I have absolutely no clue what I’m doing

I come on, I see what DD gets posted, if it makes sense I look at the users post history, and then I read some of the better comments, then a little googling, and decide to jump or not and for how much",Tallywacka,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/ljms5p/success_vs_failure_rate_on_penny_stocks/gnevdwf/,0.052,0.889,0.06,0.1045
413,DD, To be fair knowing how the stock market works is like knowing how to play blackjack well. Doing good DD and researching is like knowing what both of the dealers cards are. There’s still a chance to lose but the house no longer has the edge,mydogfartzwithz,4,/r/pennystocks/comments/ljms5p/success_vs_failure_rate_on_penny_stocks/gne8rhn/,0.089,0.686,0.226,0.4939
414,DD, HITIF and CATV are the only two I’m holding. My advice for myself and take it how you’d like... don’t invest what you’re not willing to lose. I like these two specifically because of their celebrity backing and free publicity due to that. CATV has Jay Glazer NFL Insider and HITIF I’m sure you’ve done your DD as you mentioned that already.

416,IMO, I think the hype is building here. It may gap up a little but as always there will likely be a pullback at some point. This is a long hold IMO.,Essos101,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/ljts7y/ipsi_innovative_payment_solution_could_be_the/gng8qwe/,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
