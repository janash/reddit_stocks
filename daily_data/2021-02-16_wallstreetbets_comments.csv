0,SA," Dude, you're gonna pay interest rate on the short that already bakes in the market expectation that the SA currency is shit. You can't just take an obvious bet and make free money. Everyone knows the Rand will depreciate.

1,SA," I've just shorted South Africa with my entire life. A couple months ago I became one of those educated few who fled the country looking for greener pastures, leaving behind friends and family to do so. I'm not the only one, I can tell you that much. I barely know any friends from SA who either haven't left or have no plans to leave. The country is such an incredible place but the gouvernment in power is running it into the ground as hard and as fast as possible. 

For me this isn't a financial thing, this is watching my home burn to the ground and running away from the flames. It's a horrendous sight but if you can make money off it, go wild.

TL;DR - This is probably decent advice.",AmazingMrIncredulous,3312,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkzviy/i_am_going_to_short_the_whole_country_of_south/gnmqk6y/,0.072,0.897,0.031,-0.6597
2,IBKR," >My new broker, IBKR, allows negative currency positions as long you post 10% as collateral. Now my native currency are US dollars, where inflation in 2020 was 1.4% while the South African Rand's inflation was 4.12% in 2020. That equals a 26.8% return on investment per year from that simple short position.

This makes no sense. None, nada, zilch. Firstly, to make money, you have to beat the forwards, not the spot rate; I hope you understand this. Secondly, inflation can be one macro driver of returns, but has no mathematical relationship with your returns.

You portray this as a positive carry bet, when in fact it's a negative carry bet. Short rates are about 3.5% in South Africa, and almost zero in the US. So, if you take a short position and nothing happens, you lose 3.5% a year on an unleveraged basis (I assume your broker isn't giving you interbank rates, and hence for this example, I use a spread of 3.5% for indicative purposes.) Leveraged 10 times, that means you lose 35% a year if USDZAR moves sideways over that period. 

You may lose money, you may make money; it's a fair bet, after all. But at least get the basic premise correct.",VandalsStoleMyHandle,824,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkzviy/i_am_going_to_short_the_whole_country_of_south/gnmy9qs/,0.066,0.849,0.085,0.6258

5,SA," A South African here who is a member of the ANC. You might value my perspective. 

1) the Economic freedom fighters is not as powerful as you claim here 

2) they to my knowledge donot have the mobs you describe. Seems like a conspiracy theory. 

3) the corruption is really bad. Not going to fight it. But there is a large caucus within the ANC trying to drive out the corruption. So depending on which faction wins, your puts could get wrecked. 

4) the Reserve Bank is independent (for now) so your QE fears are exaggerated. Inflation is largely driven by increasing import prices because the exchange rate has tanked. Why the exchange rate has tanked is complicated. Idk if it will continue to deteriorate. If you want to short SA, a currency short may not be good. 
During COVID the reserve Bank has been very reluctant to lower interest rates. They are arguably too conservative. Money printing is not a valid fear imo. If the reserve bank is nationalized, then you should worry. 

5) instead of a currency short look at shorting the small caps on the Joburg stock exchange.  Most of them are dog shit but still priced like they will succeed. 

6) investors should be shit scared of the Economic freedom fighters. However, they are unlikely to win an election any time in the future. 

7) crime is bad here but we don’t have pirates? Wha???

As a long time observer of South African politics, I can't fault you for being pessimistic on South Africa' prospects.

Consequently, making any short term (2 - 5 year) bets on the country seems hard; maybe the economy blows up, or maybe the end of Covid19 sees a commodities boom that boosts the rand. Maybe Cyril cleans up a bit, or maybe DD Mabuza unseats him at the next party conference. Maybe Ace is President one day, maybe he gets shuffled out.

Except the brokerages who lent out their customer stocks, it seems like those brokerages would still on the hook for returning stock to the customer, right?

This is not good news if you are holding a long on the basis of a short squeeze, 138,000 shares is nothing. OP is doing mental gymnastics.

111,JP," It's the banking world's dirty secret ever since 1907 when JP Morgan (the man not the bank) had to bail out the US government. Shorting, volume and supply can cause catastrophic results especially if everyone decides fuck this I am taking my cash out the banking system. Look at this from wiki - sounds familiar:

Augustus' brother, Otto, devised the scheme to corner United Copper, believing that the Heinze family already controlled a majority of the company. He also believed that a significant number of the Heinze's shares had been borrowed, and sold short, by speculators betting that the stock price would drop, and that they could thus repurchase the borrowed shares cheaply, pocketing the difference. Otto proposed a short squeeze, in which the Heinzes would aggressively purchase as many remaining shares as possible, and then force the short sellers to pay for their borrowed shares. The aggressive purchasing would drive up the share price, and, being unable to find shares elsewhere, the short sellers would have no option but to turn to the Heinzes, who could then name their price.[19]
To finance the scheme, Otto, Augustus and Charles Morse met with Charles T. Barney, president of the city's third-largest trust, the Knickerbocker Trust Company. Barney had provided financing for previous Morse schemes. Morse, however, cautioned Otto that in order to attempt the squeeze, Otto needed much more money than Barney had, and Barney declined to provide funding.[20] Otto decided to attempt the corner anyway. On Monday, October 14, he began aggressively purchasing shares of United Copper, which rose in one day from $39 to $52 per share. On Tuesday (Oct. 15), he issued the call for short sellers to return the borrowed stock. The share price rose to nearly $60, but the short sellers were able to find plenty of United Copper shares from sources other than the Heinzes. Otto had misread the market, and the share price of United Copper began to collapse.[21]
The stock closed at $30 on Tuesday and fell to $10 by Wednesday (Oct. 16). Otto Heinze was ruined. The stock of United Copper was traded outside the hall of the New York Stock Exchange, literally an outdoor market ""on the curb"" (this curb market would later become the American Stock Exchange). After the crash, The Wall Street Journal reported, ""Never has there been such wild scenes on the Curb, so say the oldest veterans of the outside market"".[22]

Contagion spreadsEdit

The failure of the corner left Otto unable to meet his obligations and sent his brokerage house, Gross & Kleeberg, into bankruptcy. On Thursday, October 17, the New York Stock Exchange suspended Otto's trading privileges. As a result of United Copper's collapse, the State Savings Bank of Butte Montana (owned by F. Augustus Heinze) announced its insolvency. The Montana bank had held United Copper stock as collateral against some of its lending and had been a correspondent bank for the Mercantile National Bank in New York City, of which F. Augustus Heinze was then president.
F. Augustus Heinze's association with the corner and the insolvent State Savings Bank proved too much for the board of the Mercantile to accept. Although they forced him to resign before lunch time,[23] by then it was too late. As news of the collapse spread, depositors rushed en masse to withdraw money from the Mercantile National Bank. The Mercantile had enough capital to withstand a few days of withdrawals, but depositors began to pull cash from the banks of the Heinzes' associate Charles W. Morse. Runs occurred at Morse's National Bank of North America and the New Amsterdam National. Afraid of the impact the tainted reputations of Augustus Heinze and Morse could have on the banking system, the New York Clearing House (a consortium of the city's banks) forced Morse and Heinze to resign all banking interests.[24] By the weekend after the failed corner, there was not yet systemic panic. Funds were withdrawn from Heinze-associated banks, only to be deposited with other banks in the city.[25]
A week later many regional stock exchanges throughout the nation were closing or limiting trading. For example, the Pittsburgh city's stock exchange closed for three months starting on October 23, 1907",willlfc2019,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll68pc/the_sec_just_posted_the_new_numbers_for_failure/gnoiv71/,0.089,0.819,0.091,-0.3675

* Will it forever be a highly expensive, premium product or will there eventually be a Foundry Lyte for small to mid-size businesses?
* Is there a world where Palantir provides value to consumer's daily life? Could Palantir offer a Siri or Alexa competitor to help everyday people make good choices?

204,PLTR," I truly appreciate this write up. PLTR has all the ingredients to become one of the most profitable, influential and integral data analysis companies of the future. I am not quite sure that the industry has a specific niche for their product suite. Very likely many products will be built and the whole segment is yet to be defined, around or within palantir ecosystem.

I wonder if anyone else knows some of these things..

- what is the avg implementation time for a client project?
- would the company have to change their internal operations  or is palantir less intrusive, than say an ERP or CRM?
- speaking of, where does it ""fit"" within current Salesforce, Oracle, Microsoft, SAP, Netsuite world?

205,SAP," I truly appreciate this write up. PLTR has all the ingredients to become one of the most profitable, influential and integral data analysis companies of the future. I am not quite sure that the industry has a specific niche for their product suite. Very likely many products will be built and the whole segment is yet to be defined, around or within palantir ecosystem.

I wonder if anyone else knows some of these things..

- what is the avg implementation time for a client project?
- would the company have to change their internal operations  or is palantir less intrusive, than say an ERP or CRM?
- speaking of, where does it ""fit"" within current Salesforce, Oracle, Microsoft, SAP, Netsuite world?

PLTR will being acting as the control tower for every NATO forward deployed unit in the future.

I watched PLTR's demo day earlier this morning (I posted my raving in the DT) and seeing their ability to synthesize all spectrums of SIGINT/ELINT, HUMINT, IMINT, OSINT into a single platform is ***incredibly disruptive*** to the current way things are done in military Intelligence & the chain of command.

In other words, they’re competing with other big tech companies on non-government contracts whereas government contracts are basically a fish in a barrel for them. That said, the DD does make a case for corporate focused growth - however, I’m taking that with a grain of salt considering the author’s background and the lack of a comprehensive comparison.

Hard to tell if it's gonna be a net positive ROI on that deal. $500M~ in pre-IPO equity was a lot to give away to get market penetration. Plus Sompo owns 50% of the Japan business, so Palantir is only getting half the money: https://www.coverager.com/sompo-and-palantir-cofound-palantir-japan/

305,PLTR," We mostly agree, just to be clear :) 

I’m a genuine believer in PLTR in the long run (I literally risked my life for the company) but I have no clue what is coming down the pike this week. I think the volatility will wildly unpredictable for a while until the VCs unwind their positions and the big funds/indexes put on their positions. I don’t think the retail play will have a massive difference on when and where that wind/unwind settles. 

As I discussed, I don’t think it’s a YOLO play as there are so many unknowns in the coming few days, nor do I make any prediction on the short term stock price. 

My point is that I left the company 6 years ago, and I’m genuinely impressed in where it went after I left. Between that and some of the big new deals with orgs that don’t fuck around I’m bullish that Palantir grows into 11 figures of annual revenue in the long term. 

Whether there is a 5% or 50% dip this week, or a too the moon north of $100b, I really don’t plan to adjust my position or my core thesis about Palantir. I’m probably gonna sleep through market open on the day I’m unlocked as I’m 5 hours behind EST.

And yes, I have to be careful about what I post as I am under a standard NDA that survives my employment agreement. That’s why I heavily source/link to public information about Palantir deployments to be on the safe side.",Ada_Diamonds,79,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkngg9/former_pltr_engineer_dd_part_2_usability/gnlqt63/,0.034,0.839,0.127,0.9728

Or

They can get long all of the underlying basket except for GME and short the ETF containing GME for a net exposure of short GME.

&#x200B;

The thing with the net exposure to GME is if the underlying basket starts to drop in value while GME increases in value, they are digging themselves into a larger hole than they were in before potentially much quicker than it would have been if they had just covered GME.

“One benefit ETFs provide to the average investor is ease of entry. These products do not have uptick rules, so investors can decide to short the shares even if the market is on a downtrend. What this means is that rather than waiting for a stock to trade above its last executed price (or an uptick), the investor can short sell the shares at the next available bid and immediately enter into the short position. This is important for investors wishing for quick entry to capitalize on the market's downward momentum. With regular stocks, the investor would not be able to enter into the position if the downward pressure was great.”

366,GME," Short answer: Yes to a degree.

Longer answer: It is possible to short an etf while ""boxing"" their short on specific companies in that short. The only way they could efficiently do this however is to do a blast order (essentially sending multiple buy/sell orders at the same time to box their position at minimal loss). There are a few issues that could arise from this, like the etf price being slightly off from it's true value (the % value of all the positions in the etf's portfolio on a per share basis) and the potential of the % of GME in the etf portfolio changing and the hedge fund not matching the change in a timely manner. Given all that, I still think that they will be able to do it given that they can work with HFT algos to match these issues for the most part.",Egolith,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lky552/hiding_shorts_by_etfs/gnngjdg/,0.0,0.88,0.12,0.9439

405,AP," They've allegedly shorted 180% of the ETF itself, which trades under its own ticker and has its own shares. They would ultimately need to cover the shorts by buying shares of the ETF to return to whoever they borrowed those shares from.

An ETF trades at the price people will pay for it, like anything else, but it has an underlying net asset value (NAV) that is the price based on the market price of all the things inside the etf (weighted, etc.). Special entities called authorized participants get to make arbitrage trades creating/redeeming shares of the ETF for shares of the contents, which serves to peg the value of the ETF at or very close to the NAV, at least during normal market conditions (if things are super wanky these can become decoupled, but most ETFs almost always trade very close to the NAV. For example, XRT (the ETF in question here) closed at $80.01, with an NAV of $79.96. 5 cents off, pretty close. Incidentally though that tiny 5 cent gap is actually big by the standards of how close ETFs usually stay. VOO, a classic big boring index ETF, closed at $360.96 to its NAV of $360.94. (If you aren't an AP, and only a few huge institutions are, you can't usually swap shares of the underlying for shares of the ETF directly).

I mention this because the idea is that you could borrow and short shares of the ETF itself, but because the value of those shares is essentially the NAV of the securities inside, you could buy all the individual securities in the ETF except GME in order to cover all of the value of the ETF except for what part of the NAV is represented by GME. This would  be very very close in value to a GME short position. If you decide to close the short, you sell the other securities and use the money from selling them to buy the shares of XRV you need to deliver.

The fund is re-balanced every 3 months - last time in December, next on March 19.

&#x200B;

Using December as our starting point; GME made up 1.54% of the ETF.

ETF market cap at the time was about $457M, so I figure the ETF had about $7M worth of GME shares. GME was going for around $15 at the time, so let's say they owned 466,666 shares in GME

At GME's peak of $450\~ on Jan 28, the ETF's GME holdings would have been worth $210M. The fund's market cap at that time would have been around  $667M - making GME about 31% of the ETF.  

Right now, GME is trading at $50. So the ETF's GME shares are currently worth $23M. The fund's market cap right now is $580M which means the ETF's GME holding is about 3.97% of the fund right now.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In terms of predictions and astrology;

Assuming on March 19, the ETF wants to get back to a 1.54% balance AND a fair/realistic price estimate for the ETF would be $70 AND the market cap would be something like $507M THEN, the fund would either need to sell off a bunch of GME to get back down to it only being 1.54% of their holdings OR, the price of GME would have to go down to $17\~/share.

I don't have a handy source of historical market cap data so I just prorated the current market cap/price back to get december & peak market cap estimates.

I guess the current FTE was the least expensive option and they'd have to move to the next FTE if they run out of time-to-cover. Not sure how long this can go for as I haven't checked how many FTEs have a significant GME position.

452,GME, I understand how you short to 180%. The problem is the issue of new shares by the ETF. Basically it can't be squeezed and the ETF value never varies much from the NAV. This seems to open up all sorts of market manipulation. Say you shorted the ETF when GME was at 480 then you ladder attacked GME using the money from the ETF short. You cover your short on the ETF and if the price  goes up they just print new shares at the new NAV.

548,COR," I'm staying away from it with a ten foot pole (it's a speculative stock, I'm not opening a short position on it because who knows what will happen), but I think they are in serious long term trouble if you look at what their costs are doing relative to their revenue:

https://imgur.com/a/YJ3AUQb

Yes, their revenue is growing, but 25% and 35% YOY growth is really just okay for an emerging software company. Meanwhile their Cost of Revenue (who knows what that even is for a software company) grew 47% and 48%.

They clearly tried to tighten the belt in 2019 and get control of Overhead (only went up 2%), but over the last 12 months overhead has gone up an ASTOUNDING 68%. For revenue growth of 38% that's simply inexcusable. It kind of makes me think they're incompetent.

Meanwhile compare to Tesla, which I pulled the same numbers for in that IMGUR link. Their revenue increased 83% from 2017 to 2018. How much did their COR increase? 83% which makes sense for a manufacturer. Their overhead only increased 11%.

2019 they managed to grow revenue while tightening the belt (Overhead went down 7%, revenue still went up 15%, COR went up 18%). That's the sign of a company whose management is maturing. 

2020 their revenue went up by 28% and CoR and Overhead both went up by less than that.

It's competence vs. incompetence. ANYBODY increase revenue by 35% if they're increasing their Cost of Revenue 48% and their overhead 68%. I'm not saying I expect their management to be as competent as Tesla's, but any retard can make more money if their costs are going up twice as much in percentage terms lmao.

551,CPA," It's a bit more nuanced then that though. Tesla and Palantir are not comparable in terms of industry or growth stage. I'm willing to bet that a lot of Palantir's COGS relates to expenses that will in fact generate recurring revenue. A lot of the initial cost hits when you onboard a customer (integrating your software, structuring and tabulating the data, training the in house staff), but it's not until you get that recurring revenue in future periods that your overall contract margin starts to increase. You often have to recognize all of those costs up front for accounting purposes- whereas in Tesla's instance, the R&D spend on developing their cars was able to be almost entirely capitalised to the balance sheet.

Do you see the disconnect here? He may be in it for the long term, but since the squeeze happened, I'm sure he reevaluated and cashed out to make better use of that capital by buying back in at a later date.

It is now obvious that AMC and its lenders see stockholders; specifically retail as someone they can exploit to stave off bankruptcy.  Maybe that is okay.  With bankruptcy, shareholders would have lost everything.  I am just not going to continue holding the bag.

1007,PLTR, Short opinion on PLTR earnings: I am double bullish as of today. Their net loss is overshadowed like last quarter bc of their aggressive investment on sales team. They already have achieved an insane growth operating income and just margin overall. Also Papa Karp basically said fuck off to gamblers saying this is a long term investment and should look elsewhere for short term gains. They don't give a fuck about quarterly earnings and do not plan on losing sight over quarterlies. Their focus is yearly and i fully agree with their aggressive investment on sales.,wsbloverrrrrr,19,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll1ir4/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_16_2021/gnnavxk/,0.14,0.745,0.115,-0.4065

- Toxic depreciating assets (cable TV, directv, landlines)
- SpaceMobile is a fraud and won't happen
- T-Mobile is eating their cellular market share
- Starlink is about to eat their broadband market share
- Need to spend a lot of money on 5g upgrade to serve the same customers and stay competitive
- Money losing movie making business (Warner acquisition), and struggling even more due to the pandemic (like empty theme parks and movie theaters)
- Money losing streaming business with huge expenses (hbo max). No way it will catch up even to money losing Disney streaming business
- Massive debt, which forces them to liquidate core money making assets
- Awful reputation, the company can't compete for talent within the tech industry. Their salaries are laughably non-competitive (https://www.levels.fyi/company/AT-and-T/salaries/Software-Engineer/).
- The stock is propped by huge dividends. They may suspend those like Nokia did and similarly the stock will instantly lose 30% of its value.

1275,NSA," TL;DR:  I sold my T position this week after holding for nearly 4 years, so it's probably about to moon.

AT&T's legacy business is wireline.  In a very real sense Unix and the Internet are both by-products of AT&T's need to route information efficiently over a network of wirelines.  Eventually as that information became digitized, AT&T's core business model could be summed up as 'bit delivery'.  And for most of the Internet era, say 1969-2015, you could not reasonably plan to send a bit any significant distance over the Internet without it traveling at some point on an AT&T pipe.  

That, incidentally, is why the US special first-responder intranet, FirstNet, is run by AT&T.  That is why large windowless hardened buildings owned by AT&T in all major cities have special locked rooms where NSA diverts sigint into projects like the 90's era Echelon - and why Palantir's government contracts require similar access.  (A conspiracy nut recently parked an explosives-laden Winnebago outside Nashville's instance of this building and took a major chunk of the Internet offline for three days.)

As more bits became delivered to and by cellphones, AT&T partnered with American Tower and Crown Castle International to build out the infrastructure, and with Apple to capture the associated revenue - there was a point around the iPhone 3 era where more than 50% of iPhone sales revenue was coming straight to Apple out of AT&T's pocket, and they were making it up on the long-term contract.  (It's why Apple didn't break out iPhone revenue data until years later; it would have affected their bargaining position with their major customer.)

There has been so much ink spilled on why the fuck T acquired DirecTV in 2015 that people overlook the obvious.  An upstart competitor arose that delivered bits from producers direct to consumers without ever they travel on an AT&T pipe.  This heresy was not to be tolerated, any more than Hanover tolerated the bonnie Prince Charles Stuart.  It was acquired and left to rot in place.

However, AT&T accumulated way too much debt in this maneuver and took their eyes off the prize for a minute as they tried to dig out.  Their subsequent acquisition of WarnerMedia - more properly called a merger, as Warner top brass are now in control of the combined companies - left them proper fucked and when the 5G auction came in $60B more than expected - with more to come - it left them with their pants down on their debt reduction plan.

While this is going on and they are staring down the barrel of $200B in debt?

Meet [Starlink, by Elon Musk.](https://www.starlink.com/)  You may have heard of Mr Musk before; his core business is not bit delivery.  It is success enabled by operational excellence.  1025 of a planned (and FCC approved) 32000 satellites are already in orbit.  The system is fully armed and operational and has customers.  Bits are being delivered from space that never cross an AT&T pipe.  He did it without public financing. He will never pay a dollar to a cell tower company, nor will he deploy even one white van with a Starlink logo on the side and two men with heavy toolbelts suitable for telephone-pole climbing inside of it.

Meet [Kuiper](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/amazons-project-kuiper-satellite-internet-tests-prototype-antenna.html).  Kuiper is Jeff Bezos' competing project.  If you think Bezos was inspired by AT&T on this one, I want some of what you're smoking.  Bezos knows perfectly well that for Amazon to guarantee continued existence, it must retain the ownership of the right to deliver bits between itself and its customers, and not rely on the guarantee of governments or the good will of competitors for same.  Did Bezos elect to string wirelines along every stretch of road that AT&T owns wirelines strung along?  No, no he did not.

AT&T will be around for a long, long time to come, but its era as a solo monopoly utility has ended.  It has been disrupted.  It should no longer be valued, nor its debt rated, as commensurate with a monopoly, a utility, nor a tech company; if you assign it any value, I strongly suggest valuing it like any old bookseller or internal-combustion vehicle vendor.  Or a typewriter company.  Or a vendor of buggy whips - I hear there's a pocket of demand in Lancaster County still.

1284,DD," That depends entirely on your goals and how much capital you have to work with, as well as your risk tolerance. 

Do you want to own more T? Do you want to make some possible quick money at some risk, or a lot of risk? What would be the ideal outcome for you?

As it stands, you have 2 real options:

Option A - Lower risk, lower reward - Sell to open a put. To do this you will need collateral to cover the purchase of 100 shares at your set strike price. Let's say $29.50. So you'll need $2950. You sell to open the put, and are awarded premium - You keep this regardless of what happens next. Your brokerage will take $2950 and hold it as collateral. IF the stock rises above $29.50 - You get your collateral back and keep the premium. If the stock does not rise above $29.50, you will be forced to buy 100 shares for $2950. 

Outcome - 1) You could end up overpaying for the stock. 2) You could get a slight discount for the stock. 3) You get the premium and walk away.

According to this DD you might see outcome 3, but who fuckin' knows. This is casino.


Option B - The riskier play. You would Buy to Open a Call option. In this situation you pay the premium - which will vary based on the strike price and the expiration date. If the stock rises above your strike before the expiration date, your call is ""In the money"" and you can sell it for more than you paid - potentially a lot more, or you can exercise it yourself and buy 100 shares at the strike price. If the stock does not hit the strike price, you will lose all the premium you paid. 

Possible Outcomes - 1) You lose everything. 2) You exercise the call and get a discount on 100 shares or 3) You sell the call and profit handsomely. 


What's the play? I don't know. I'm not your fuckin' financial advisor. If I was a financial advisor I'd tell you to buy and hold it forever for the boomer dividends. 

If you were asking me as a friend I'd tell you that their debt is insane, their dividend is unsustainable and it's a gay boomer stock whose board doesn't know how to properly monetize their media assets. 

So TL;DR - There's probably better ways to spend your money, but this is a casino and I don't give a fuck what you do. I'm just here for the free coffee.

Or help them realize that they can replace hundreds of excel jockey office workers with a script and 2 IT guys. IMO It's going to take a significant re-imagining of the US economy for US consumer demand to reach previous peaks, the short term change is going to be completely driven off of stimulus payments to normal people. Also in the near term we will definitely see a short peak in oil once interstate travel is normalized again because of pent up pandemic demand to get out of the house, but it will be short lived.

I haven't written a DD but there are plenty out there. I encourage you to do some research. My biggest plays are Suncor and Exon Mobil.

The bull thesis goes something like this. We've had low prices for 5 years due to US shale (Remember drill baby drill, and how everyone laughed in 2008, well it worked) The US has been a net exporter of oil. We did it, we achieved energy independence, created millions of good jobs, and flooded the world with cheap oil. America, fuck yeah! Unfortunately, cheap oil means oil companies were all hurting.

Then covid hit, global demand dropped from 100 million bbl a day to 92 and oil is so inelastic it destroyed prices. Oil companies were hit hard and posted a year of losses, many cut dividends, shares fell as much as 70%. This also happened under a backdrop of increasing political pressure to move away from oil and a speculative fervor in EVs and green energy.

Production was wiped out. Oil majors such as RDS and BP are no longer exploring for new finds. Shale? Shale needs 45-55 bbl oil and is unlikely to come back soon. The sentiment is that oil is a dying industry. Oil consumption will never return to precovid levels. We will all drive EVs and use solar and wind.

Except.. we need oil. We need lots of it. We can't live without it. We will be using oil for another 30 years. Demand is expected to return. Suddenly oil is back to $60 bbl and recovery hasn't started. China and India are growing faster than we can move away from oil.

Don't take my word for it. Below is a link to the E.I.A. report released in Feb detailing our projected energy mix. Keep in mind this was produced by a bipartisan group high on green energy hopium. Also is a projection for crude from JP Morgan over the next year. I through in some DD floating around on reddit. Do a search for oil or XOM or SU on WSB. There is a DD on oil every other day. It just gets lost in a sea of junk stocks.

Where is all this oil going to come from, if demand will increase beyond 2019 levels and remain above past 2030? That's a great question. And remember that part about demand being inelastic...

This is what people mean by a new super cycle in commodities. Here we are. Prices are set to soar.

Pick an oil company. Look at where they were when oil was at $68 a bbl on average for the year. Look at the price they are at now, and invest. You can't go wrong.

Personally my biggest play is SU.

1484,PLTR," Do you understand what PLTR does?

Their primary business is essentially creating a digital replication of your business with all the moving parts so you can understand if you do one thing how that impacts everything else. With the military they would be combining together data about all your resources and supply chains and any available data about an enemy you want to monitor so you can efficiently plan and respond to any threat without needing thousands of people to try to collate the data in a giant mess. At least that is what I understood from it.

It is not some much espionage or data collection, but rather pulling that data together in a meaningful way.  I know sounds creepy, but it is darn useful.

Any significant business not using PLTR will find themselves facing a competitive disadvantage as their competitors are able to respond quicker to changing facts. PLTR might be a trillion dollar business one day. Definitely a will be a few hundred billion.

Edit - Wait till PLTR makes a public version of their program where you can do complex searches online pulling together all sorts of data. Anyone who wants to trade a stock will have to pay for access to it, as there will not be any better way to analyze a stock.

1491,PLTR," I mean, I think all of this is nonsense. PLTR is losing money. Their costs are going up faster than their revenue. They are reliant upon equity for cash to keep the lights on. If their equity tanks they will literally run out of cash.

All that aside (because I know it won't matter): The idea that this is an American way of structuring a corporation is ridiculous. The American stock market is the largest and most powerful in the world largely because American common law and business practice has a long, consistent history of *aggressively* protecting the rights and interests of minority shareholders. It makes people more willing to invest, quite simply.

You cannot be forced to sell your stock. You can attend any investor meeting. Your shares cannot be diluted without your consent. You have the right to vote for corporate governance. Those rights are IMPORTANT! Minority investors do not have those rights everywhere!

PLTR minority investors (apparently everyone but the founders *forever*) have no rights, will never have any rights, and their ""interests"" could potentially be represented by *people opposed by 90+% of shareholders*

For someone who won't do business *with* China, they sure do business *like* China.

We are retail investors. Of any group of investors, we have the strongest interest in protecting and promoting the rights of minority shareholders and an American way of handling equity because it protects us more than anything else.

They have the same platform as Zillow with their Rocket Homes app (and Zillow is valued more than all of Rocket’s 15 companies combined), they own the largest title insurance agency in the country (Amrock), they have an army of retailers in their in-house reality program, they offer Rocket TPO which is a CRM connecting brokers, lenders, insurance agents and retailers all on one app resolving what used to be a complicated mess, their Nexsys esigning package allows for remote online notarization in the most states compared to any other RON technology, They literally own every piece of the mortgage market especially now that they are pushing toward wholesale loans and partnering with local brokers. 

They are breaking into e-commerce car market that is far from being disrupted (95 percent of cars are sold at conventional dealerships), Their rock connections company continues to partner with other corporations with its proprietary sales analytical software, core digital media is allowing them greater propensity and accuracy with their ad dollars, they are partnering with intuit and realtor.com to connect their software to brand name apps that allow clients to check their refi eligibility within 8 minutes, they’re handing out Rocket Loans like a digitized version of Tony Soprano ...  and you really think they’re gonna stop here?

You can bet your ass apha/tlry will do all they can to start providing weed and getting licensed in the states. ALL of the competition in the USA doesn't matter; I bet roughly 60% of the companies currently aiming for the weed business will disappear.

&#x200B;

Apha and Tlry have already been a part of this process, have the infrastructure, will be turning a profit and will have a much easier time doing this.

&#x200B;

I have read up on apha and tlry, apha alone turns a profit, merged they will turn a profit. How many us companies are turning a profit, I bet not many.

1686,VFF," Merger has been confirmed, the ratio has been confirmed.  Both CEO's have expressed positive sentiment towards the merger as they know it will be the biggest weed company in the world actually pulling a profit.

&#x200B;

Could it fall through, sure it could. My penis may also become a hammer, is it likely, prob not. There's a bigger positive for a merger then not. Apha anyways regardless of merger is the stronger company which is pulling a profit and would have had 62% ownership.

Buy them after a market crash and hold then long term.  
Not now , or you will learn the hard way how long it takes waiting for years and years till they go up again . 

I did hold BLDP all the day till 0,58$ in 2008, after years of accumulating . Believe me, that was one of my darkest moments to test the DIAMOND HANDS. 
eventually I sold out in 2014 top 6,75$ with a nice profit in total .

That was 14 years of diamond hands.

They have the best yielding production methods (translation: chips go BRRR) and they deliver on time. Their biggest competitor as a foundry in terms of scale and production is Samsung. One edge Samsung has had is that they have a large fab in the US, however this edge will soon be gone; TSMC is building a production facility in the beautifully arid southwest. They’re already poaching top talent from other fabs. In the near future, many of their chips will be made in the US which means more incentives for both TSMC and their customers.

1830,AMD," Depends on what you are after.

I think TSM is a buy because they (along with Samsung) currently have an absolute lock on the smallest manufacturing processes. This is super important for high powered electronics like CPUs or GPUs or mobile phones. They don't however, focus very much any more on other semiconductor markets. Simply put, the very small nanometer processes that we use for CPUs and GPUs are really hard to make. They have high (relative) failure rates, and take more time to complete. Because of this TSM can't really make both the super in demand and very expensive stuff, like they do for AMD and Nvidia, as well as the less intense but lower margin stuff like auto-manufacturing robot parts. So, its the best performance product semiconductor stock, but not the best sales volume semiconductor stock. 

That said, I love TSM, and I think theyre going to be even bigger than they already are. I think they're headed to be a company like what Samsung is now, a Massive corp with many hands in many pots, not just semiconductors. Also, the huge lock they have on the small nanometer processes puts them in a bracket where really only Samsung competes with them, and with the shortage, they're clearly primed to expand.

TL;DR I'm long TSM, but I think they are going to be a slow grow for a while. I think other semiconductor stocks focused on sales volume and less intense fab processes will do better for the short term.

I’ve often heard the preferreds as being thought of as “safer” in the event the NWS gets eliminated and the orgs recapped. I think general consensus for differentiating among the preferreds (There are lots of different classes) was to look at the spread between current price and par value of each class.

FNMA and FMCC commons are like moonshots/weeklies, because the Treasury retained a shitton if warrants. If the Treasury exercises those warrants, then the commons get diluted to oblivion.

For more info on this trade, look into u/TheSerpent and u/NOVACPA ‘s post history—they are WSB OGs who have been all over this trade for years.",RomulusAugustus753,58,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkn9vj/fnma_and_fmcc_going_to_explode_soon_compare_them/gnkt4ao/,0.0,0.896,0.104,0.9231
1855,APA," For anyone who read this, I've been following this trade for about 4 years now. I bought in at a bad time and I'm underwater but I still believe in the underlying investment thesis and thus have not sold all the times I've been above water too.

I am going to quickly break it down for people:

INVESTMENT VEHICLES:

1. OP is pumping the common, this is likely a massive mistake. The jr pfds are likely much better and still have a potential 5x upside at today's prices (a month or so ago I put in another 12k). There are MANY MANY things that need to go right for the common to payout, and the commons basically have zero legal representation at the moment. Pfds have much fewer things that need to go right to get paid and have almost all the heavy hitters behind them. Ackman is the only guy holding commons I believe.

WHAT MAY HAPPEN:

1. Right now we are all-in on a SCOTUS ruling in our favor. 5th circuit went our way but all those gains have been sold off. If we win SCOTUS, guess what, if the government doesn't settle we could still be waiting 2-3 years for the APA claims to be judged on evidence. We have a STRONG case on that though and the government likely doesn't want egg on its face. If SCOTUS goes against us good fucking luck, we have one more case that is slated for 1.5 years from now or so and besides that we're at the mercy of the new admin and congress (e.g. we lose 50% or so from here at least).

WHERE WE HAVE BEEN:

1. The previous admin promised to make changes and get us out of conservatorship and basically failed to deliver entirely. The companies cap standards are pretty miserable now and Mnuchin basically kicked the can down the road (pray to Yellen if you buy in cause you're her bitch now). Court cases have been like all court cases and infinitely slow but the gears do turn.

HOW TO DO SOME DD:

1. Go follow holdenwalker99 and urbankaoboy on Twitter. Do not follow Glenn (used to post as /u/TheSerpent on here). That guy is a fucking moron who has some major fucking ego problems. You will come across his name often on this trade as he is a good flag bearer, but don't pay any attention to his thinking, like I said, fucking moron. The two dudes I mentioned are probably the most rational and knowledgeable (respectively) people I have come across in the years I have been following it. Glenn is more like the mascot at a sports game while the other two are the players.


Anyways, if you buy in, be prepared for the long haul. This trade is something that forever seems to be just a few weeks around the corner to a Nirvana that never comes. Many people have aptly called it the ""Waiting for Godot"" trade for that reason.

Anyways, good luck!

TL/DR - OP is likely a moron trying to get you into the shitty side of this rollercoaster investment. Buy jr pfds, avoid the ones that have zero % interest rates right now, and good fucking luck to us all.",SirBuzzKill777,33,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkn9vj/fnma_and_fmcc_going_to_explode_soon_compare_them/gnkwgaq/,0.081,0.788,0.13,0.9838

I've listed to the SCOTUS arguments several times. To your point an APA claim could still be several years out from settlement which means half decade for par value. The unconstitutionality seems like a win but no way they provide any sort of relief. The governments greatest bargaining chip is it's ability to postpone, appeal, and generally be a pain in the share holders lawyers side. 

I think we're looking at 4 or 5 years to clear out the cases.  Then we'll likely see some sort of resolution around the time the warrants are set to expire (shocker the government needs to wait until the last minute to do anything).

1930,DGX," While I agree with your overall assessment, just wanted to put these risks out there:

1. PAMA - this is a regulatory headwind for the lab industry and probably the most important thing outside of COVID driving valuations. Essentially Medicare reimbursements have been declining by 10% a year and starting in 2022 will be 15% a year. DGX has \~15% of total sales from the government
2. Commercial Plans - Over the last few years, large plans like United and Aetna have been moving towards a value-based contract where they use a few vendors like DGX and LH but get major price concessions. read: volume tailwind, pricing headwind, net tailwind. Think this trend has largely played out so will impact overall revenues moving forward
3. COVID reimbursements - Yes, this will continue to be a tailwind, but think most equity research is expecting this. All Wall Street equity research / price targets incorporate the fact that DGX management is conservative in their guidance, so all of their models are spitting out higher numbers than the high end of the range of guidance. Also COVID reimbursements will be lower in 2021 so need to factor that in
4. Cash production from COVID - Basically all going to buying back shares and issuing dividends which is incorporated in guidance / wall street research EPS figures. Assuming $250M of buybacks per quarter, by Q4 2022 net leverage will be the same as 2019 levels
5. Other broader risks: companies trying to move into the sexier testing products like genetics, etc. that Quest has been getting a lot of its growth from

In general, the P/E is pretty dogshit for this company because of the regulatory and competitive headwinds that factor into it's annual 2-3% revenue growth (excluding COVID tailwinds) which lags that of the broader S&P. Think there is short-term potential for a lot of reasons, many of which you mentioned, but not sure if this is something I'd hold the long-term.

1932,DGX," 1) Fair and I even considered addressing this in the OP. I said in another reply that I don't intend on holding this LT, as my positions show. I think this is irrelevant if base testing rebounds while COVID $$$ remains strong over the next few Qs. For those investing LT though, I still think this gets offset by serology expansion. I believe the PAMA impacted rev is low margin as well. 

2) Agree with the premise LT, but again, see above. I do not see any impact in the near future. People have literally been putting off doctor visits and procedures for a year at this point. Plus tons of people with insurance complications in general due to job loss. The testing companies will have leverage near term. 

3) If all analysts factored in that DGX is conservative in their guidance, they wouldn't be beating the top 20% estimates of both Revenue and EPS every single Q. Lower reimbursement is already factored in, as you said. Wallstreet is still undervaluing COVID testing, completely ignoring serology, and undervaluing base case recovery. The street expects a big drop off over the next 6 months in COVID testing with a minimal contribution in Q3 and Q4. And they are wrong, again. They've underestimated how testing would play out for an entire year now. What's the definition of insanity again? 

4) Disagree, look at receivables and there is still going to be COVID rev throughout 2021. Plus massive base testing rev rebound. 

5) Longer debate. Regardless, Quest isn't and has never been priced like a glitzy biotech. 

All in all I think we actually agree most of the way here. I would only hold LT (18months+) if I had a lot of confidence in their serology push, but again, that isn't my intention regardless. Now, if you're arguing they should be trading around $120 at year end, which is where they were at before absurd COVID driven performance, I really disagree.",bauer5x,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lktkjr/dgx_quest_diagnostics_is_free_tendies/gnm5a5i/,0.112,0.821,0.066,-0.9605

1934,DGX," Have you ever worked in healthcare? There is ZERO chance hospitals substantially get into test processing over the next few years. Now, competitors coming out with better/more efficient methods, that's definitely possible. Don't see that impacting my calls though. 

COVID testing is dying down, eh? What if I told you that the month with highest tests/per day was.....January. Also known as 1/3 of DGX Q1 performance. 

That said, of course COVID testing is going to go down. Part of the OP is that people are overestimating the drop off and thinking it's going to be like turning off a light switch. Just like you are probably shocked January was the month with the most tests.....

1935,IMO," So by test processing, what do you mean and what kind of tests do you have in mind? 

I know for a fact that many hospitals hire their own scientists to run clinical tests, meaning most of the high volume assays will be done by the hospital and they will for sure try to do as much in house first to avoid long turn around times. Take for example blood typing, that's a test they need to run in house since if you need to give a patient a transfusion you may not have the time to send it over to a lab since they could die before the sample even arrives at an outside lab. As such, more esoteric assays such as STD checks or toxicology tests will be the primary source of their income.

Yes COVID numbers will show a nice Q1 as it did with Q4, but $DGX faces real problems in the future if they can't adapt to the changing landscape. Before running tests required huge labs with lots of equipment, but now biotech is making this smaller, more convenient, and requiring less equipment. 

Science and Biotech are two fields where it is very difficult to predict the future since so many mindblowing and unexpected things come from it every year. You don't know if some assay will be created that allows hospitals to not have to send stuff over to a lab. I know from talking to people in the field that there are PLENTY of assays being designed and developed by a wide plethora of companies, both big and small, to be easy and convenient for hospitals with minimal equipment to use to diagnose and help their patients. Either $DGX finds their niche as all of these new products come out within the next few years, or they continue to struggle as more tests they used to be relied on to run are no longer outsourced to them.

I mean, may the best retard win, but IMO your only leg to stand on are the Q1 numbers",TheNewsmonger,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lktkjr/dgx_quest_diagnostics_is_free_tendies/gnmsab1/,0.059,0.861,0.08,0.823

1964,IMO," IMO, the right way to think of any stock’s future price movements is that of an unknown random variable with some probability density function. 

For most price movements we like to assume a Normal distribution, implying that major price movements are extremely unlikely and, in the absence of insider information, the expected value of the price movements is essentially zero. 

When things get really interesting is when nonlinearities are at play, skewing the distribution and causing the expected value to differ dramatically. In this case, we have reason to believe that major nonlinearities are at play: 1.) the original shorts who were on the verge of margin call last time are still in their original positions, reopening the door for an infinite squeeze, 2.) shareholders believe in Ryan Cohen’s leadership and ability to turn it into a $300 stock long-term, 3.) there are other funds in a long position who wouldn’t mind bankrupting some HFs, and 4.) many shareholders believe in the squeeze opportunity, causing the ask price to be heavily skewed upward. (We’ve seen similar with TSLA: as the shorts finally capitulated, the price skyrocketed when they had to buy from diamond-handed shareholders who wouldn’t sell cheap. As Steve Eisman said, “it’s very hard to short a stock that’s a cult.”)

There’s no certainty that the squeeze will happen. And we don’t know what catalyst could cause it. But it remains a possibility, and that skews the PDF favorably toward buying and holding. 

Remember too that although the shorts don’t much mind paying interest, they do recognize how fragile their position is and they’d like to exit it as quickly as possible without triggering a bull run. Time is working against them, not because of the borrow fee, but because there is an infinite array of possible triggers. The longer they wait, the higher the probability that they will be caught if a squeeze triggers. They’re sitting on a bomb and they want to get off it as quickly and quietly as possible before something sets it off. 

TL;DR: Highly speculative play, expected value is skewed heavily upward due to short squeeze potential.

1997,DD," To be confident in something running at a specific point, there needs to be a catalyst.

A strong balance sheet will never be a catalyst, *unless* the public thought their balance sheet was weak and they release info showing it's not.

The momentum last week was already a result of the PT change. You need to do chart analysis to see if that moment could continue. It sounds like you haven't done that and you're just hoping it continues.

You also need to do some research on news catalysts, specifically conditions that lead to sell the news events. When a piece of news is fully expected, it's more likely that it becomes priced in before it happens and then sells off slightly when it does. And if the expected news actually comes out negative, it tanks. This is a case that I think is more likely to be a sell the news event. Nobody expects Biden to not pass a stronger EV tax credit. It'll run up until it's released and then you'll see a correction.

From the overall narrative in your post, it sounds like you hopped on board after the run up already started, and you *need* the run to continue. That's not good DD or strategy.

2039,RSI," Hello, I'm also new. I'm in the middle of a course on stack exchange. It was like 20 bucks. I'll fill you in on what I've learned so far.

Stock fall into 3 categories small cap, mid cap, and high cap. The first two are subject to more volatility.

Day traders hold positions for a day, swing traders (what I want to do) hold positions for a week to 3 months and investors year plus.

-technical analysis

There's three basic types of graphs

Line

Candle stick - my fav, the wicks represent the highs and low, the body is the open and close. 

Heikin aski

There's also something called a doji that is an indicator of something

When looking at it what your trying to do is establish where the line of support and resistance is.

Level 2 information is extremely useful for timing day trading, you can pay for it but I comes with some services.

RSI - relative strength indicator +70 means overbought, - 30 oversold

Vwap - volume weighted average price

Iv - implied volatility

Then there's fundamental analysis

Basically it's looking through pread sheets of warning reports

I've had some sites suggested to me but I'm not on my pc now, if you remind me in the morning I'll dig them up.

I like using trade view to look at stuff on my pc. Td seems like a good all around option as well as trade station but I already set up accounts elsewhere.

""3nm Research In U.S. To Be Spearheaded By New National Semiconductor Technology Center

While $3 billion is a striking figure which reflects the massive capital expenditure necessary for chip production, it pales in comparison to what the unpassed CHIPS Act has in store. This Act, if passed, would authorize the Commerce Secretary to appropriate to $10 billion each for manufacturing 3nm chips and below, supply chain security and verification and creation of a Manufacturing USA institute that aids American chip resurgence*.* Additionally, the $10 billion for each of these three categories will be available each year starting from 2021 to 2025, according to the text.

While the NDAA's CHIPS section doesn't outright authorize $10 billion in taxpayer funds, it does mention the 3nm manufacturing node. Right now, the only American company with the equipment needed to produce 5nm chips is Intel, whose 5nm is thought to be comparable with the [Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSMC) 3nm node](https://wccftech.com/tsmc-5nm-3nm-12-hbm-symposium/) – for which [TSMC's already started plant construction.](https://wccftech.com/tsmc-paying-145-day-to-workers-for-3nm-chip-plant-as-70-5nm-capacity-increase-rumored/)""

2136,BB," I am a physician - I've actually used the Butterfly probe for about 2 years now. When I worked in the ICU, I used it extensively for codes and to place central lines. I've actually had times during residency where my co-residents have called me to come to a code by dialysis or another area because they knew I had the butterfly probe and I was 30 seconds away, and it would take about 10 minutes to get ultrasound to run across the hospital.  (We have 4 general ultrasound carts for a 700+ bed hospital, not including the ultrasounds used by echo/radiology)

It was much faster than getting the big machine there, but most institutions will likely still use their Ultrasound carts for the time.  Most older physicians are not adept to technology and are much slower to adapt. For me, it is handy and easy to use. I usually use to keep it in my coat pocket, very hand for placing difficulty IV's on the floor as well - maybe the nurses will be able to have one on each floor where they can't afford a large ultrasound cart like in the ED or ICU. 

A lot of other younger physicians have purchased it to use it as well at my previous institution.  I've heard of some cardiology fellows telling me at their previous institutions that it was provided for them while they worked there, so maybe things are changing.  We'll see how things go - I liked having the probe connected to my iphone whenever I needed it.

Unfortunately for me, I'm pretty sure my probe was stolen by some drug seekers when they ransacked my office looking for drugs, and they stole the probe and my ultrasound G E L (my comment was removed because automod thinks it is a ticker). I got an email a month later from Butterfly asking if I sold my probe to some guy named Matt who wanted to activate it. Drug injectors usually blow a lot of their veins so they can't inject anymore, so he was likely using it to place an IV or shoot up. Too bad, he couldn't activate it, but I lost a 2000 dollar probe which I could have used to help patients.

I just saw this, didn't know they were public, I like them and hope they do well. I'll put some money in it.

2183,LUMN," I was explaining why share price compared to another company's share price doesn't matter. (Which is why we use dividend yield, PE, etc --- to make things comparable).


I think you're getting the wrong take away...

Dividend Yield is dividend divided by share price.


Comparing LUMN's 11.81 share price to T's 28.96 and saying its cheaper is faulty.


LUMN's dividend yield (1/11.81) is 8.46%.
T's is (2.08/28.96) 7.18%

$100 invested in LUMN pays you $8.46 per year.
$100 invested in T pays you $7.18 per year.

1) uranium is in short supply. It's been incredibly unprofitable to mine uranium for a while, so mines have scaled back a shit ton and now everyone is scrambling to secure uranium

2) as you said, uranium isn't going anywhere in a green future. You need it as your stable base, then add renewables on top. They have a massive construction bill, but over the course of a reactor's life, it is actually quite cheap (relative) due to their insane output. Take a look at Ontario, Canada. 50% powered by nuclear plants, with only 1 being a large plant, and 2 smaller plants. Those 3 plants power at least half of the 15m population, and they don't even have all the reactors up. 

Mines are a long term hold but they've performed nicely lately.

LELE that fucking link. Went balls deep at 10:30am.

2203,RSI," I am so happy to hear it! Yeah, you can hold for longer, but we're talking about a secure system and method. From my observations, holding for too long is way too risky, and you will mostly lose money from doing it, while gaining very few good opportunities in exchange. After you sell using RAVI, the price might still continue to the downside, but nobody knows, so you sell to take the profits the indicator actually guarantees. And again, I'm so fucking happy it works in practice. I was crazy mad I couldn't test it myself today.

And yeah, creep toe doesn't work with this indicator, I can confirm. It runs into similar routine the RSI does for some reason, becoming almost identical",SpicySlavic,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll8ikw/ravi_testing_update/gno7ys1/,0.104,0.689,0.208,0.9497
2204,HR," I dont day trade and i dont use cfd's. I was using other indicators to find a buy or a sell moment but it wasnt very acurate. Basically i wanted to test with penny stocks that have momentum, because many times i bought at the top and it went down. So this gives a pretty good measurement so far if the stock reached its top or bottom and you can see if its a pump & dump. I am using it with 30Min and 1 HR chart to predict price next few days. More testing is required of course",Global-Sky-3102,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll8ikw/ravi_testing_update/gnoa5n5/,0.034,0.819,0.147,0.8792
