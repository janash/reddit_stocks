It's still unclear how you'd use such data to predict McDonald's share price. Only I'd say if number of BJs is up, Numbers of Burgers flipped are down so less profit for McDonald's.

67,CD," Just a note /u/MayIBeAnonymous:

Activision-Blizzard has a P/E ratio of 28.35.

Other Video Game Stocks:

EA: 49.52

Take Two Interactive: 32.92

Paradox: 43.87

CD (I think i sourced it from somewhere reputable?): 16.73

Consensus Estimate P/E Ratio for 2021 for Activision/Blizzard is 22.59 at this price point (84.59)

Consensus Estimate P/E Ratio for 2022 is 19.09.

As you can see, it's strongly undervalued relative to its peers with the (possible) exception of CD Project Red. The 1 YR chart only has a 4.45% gain.

As someone who's got more knowledge than most regarding corporate compliance and risk management, i can safely tell you that this isn't going to have the material impact on earnings/share price in the long term that you think it will. Short term, yes. The market's pricing a settlement and fines. What i expect will happen is that the company will be forced to amend and enforce a new code of conduct, and implement tighter regulation of said code. They'll also pay a fine, and if there is a class action they will settle it. We'll find out how much in fines, legal fees for the law firm they hired to investigate them, and settlement money Activision-Blizzard expects they will have to pay on August 3rd when they give their risk disclosure on their earnings (which they are legally required to do).

Bobby Kotick will remain. He's too entrenched, and he owns too much of the company not to.

What I'm trying to say is... I see you're thinking of going back in. I would strongly recommend not doing so. You've admitted to saying you traded with your emotions on this one. If you continue to do so on this trade, you will likely get burned.

My cousin, who is a woman, works in the gaming industry. Specifically at Ubisoft. I've asked her about the culture at Ubisoft before, since they had a sexual harassment scandal before, and I've been meaning to call or text her to ask her if she's okay. I probably will tonight. With that said, 2000 women were not sexually assaulted (Sorry, someone in the comment section posted that), but 2000 people did sign a letter rebuking the company's leadership for their tone-deaf statement.

With that said, the cold blooded trader and investor in me thinks that if this gets anywhere near 80 or at 80 I'm going to snap this up like a Beluga whale eating krill. Probably sell some CSP's at 75 on top. I -know- there will be others like me. At some point, there will be support levels and the stock **will** bounce off it.

I am hazarding a guess that you, or someone close to you, has suffered from the scourge of sexual harassment/assault. If that is the case. I'm sorry. It's a horrible thing, and I cannot imagine the toll it takes. I posted this, not to start a fight with you, but because I wanted to give a counter point. And potentially save you money in the process.",Hani95,14,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otascd/10k_90k_because_fuck_blizzardactivision/h6v3kfl/,0.046,0.878,0.076,0.9091

Then news came out, followed by lawsuits, so I made a short weekly play knowing (hoping) they'd finally take a hit. I'm personally pissed that they're actually green again today though fortunately, I have no position with them rn anyways, but at least they're still lower than they've been all year and I hope that keeps.

Therefore, most agencies are so scared of losing and “setting a bad precedent,” that they don’t do anything but send out toothless warning letters…and if you ignore the warnings, they do nothing.

Not where I personally worked but had friends that worked for the IRS and it’s a shit-show. They pretty much know that people above a certain income limit are not paying anything. The kicker is you can get in trouble if you push too hard. They are good with catching wage earners and stock trading gains, but if you set up corps and partnerships, they’re not going to even check.

The majority of the people getting letters in this case claim their getting ""audited"" when in reality the IRS is just saying we know you didn't claim this income, pay us. 

Now you start talking businesses and it's a totally different ball game. Even for a sole proprietor. Hell I did someone's taxes and out of 700k per year in 1099 revenue, about 100k actually got reported to the IRS. And the customers were all very legit businesses and professional service companies. How are they even going to know about the rest without pulling the person's bank statements? It would actually take a full blown audit to see if all the revenue was claimed, which is resource intensive. 

I dont agree with the fact that high earners have an easier time skirting their taxes, but realistically, what is the solution? Ramping up audits might works, but damn the public outrage would be incredible when a bunch of honest small businesses had to start paying a fortune to make it through their IRS audits.",AZtraveler145,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/osxydl/robinhood_reveals_new_investigation_on_the_eve_of/h6v1ygg/,0.058,0.877,0.065,0.1791

122,IRS," The solution to a horribly staffed and funded agency of the government isn’t to just remove it. IRS *can* play a massive role in ensuring the absolutely filthy rich pay even a fraction of their fair share. Unfortunately the IRS has been getting intentionally pushed into uselessness and as nothing more than a device to watch over the poor with. IRS needs to exist, it just needs to not be getting directed by people with zero intention of making it better or more efficient.  

I applied to the IRS 6 months ago. Have gone through two rounds and am waiting to hear back.

124,IRS," 50% over 10k income would be pretty drastic, and I agree that would decimate the labor force. But I don't ever see that happening given the way our tax code is written. For the record, the guy in my example did claim every penny in income. Just the majority was not reported to the IRS prior to his return being filed. Most smaller businesses are pretty honest, or the ways they are skirting taxes is pretty negligible. As in, Joe Contractor deducted some family dinners as business meals or whatever. 

I can see the logic for the cap gains over $10mm being treated as ordinary income. And currently there are additional taxes imposed on investment income for high earners. There's the NIIT and I think the cap gains rate can go up to 28% depending on the circumstances. But, yeah, if you're making $10mm a year on cap gains, are you making some gains of investments or is your job being an investor? Making an argument for the latter would support your idea imo.

Taxing loans against shares seems to be a popular reddit idea. I wish I knew more about the terms of these loans and the claim that CEOs just keep rolling the loan over and over again, never divesting their shares, and thus never paying tax. I get that that is definitely possible for a Musk or a Bezos, but have a hard time believing it for smaller public companies. Stocks are inherently volatile and I can only imagine what kind of liquidity requirements, LTVs, etc would be required for the CEO of whatever XYZ Corp on the Russell 5000. Basically, I don't totally disagree with the idea, but need to do more research. 

I'm not sure I completely follow you on the stock buybacks. Basically a tax for consolidating the shares of a company? Idk, but I agree with lowering the dividend tax. It's double taxation anyways and additional burden for regular people.

302,DD," Very good DD Sir thank you, but I must say your estimates seem very conservative at some points. The ""the pandemic is a one-off"" take has already been refuted by their Q1 earnings, it showed that the gaming/streaming trend was here to stay and logitechs earnings yesterday showed the same thing, still growing trend in anything gaming/streaming related while for logitech the office space product started going down again, which corsair doesnt even make. Also the similar product thing might appear like that on first glance but Corsair does provide, especially with the elgato brand unmatched quality of products(specifically the software), an unmatch product experience. The wave link and also the new camera hub software make the experience so good for these products. There are some webcames that can match the quality of elgatos but not one of those can be fully software controlled down to ISO and shutter speed. Same goes for Corsair, there are other options to buy rgb fans/ram/... it is the iCUE software that makes the experience perfect. It is well made, easy to use and just syncs up everything without a problem and is extremly customizable. Corsair is very clearly playing the apple tactic here. There are many others making phones with similar quality and that for a way cheaper price but people still come back every time to buy an iphone because they know the software is good, the quality is good, it is easy to use and the whole ecosystem works together perfectly, they dont even try to go for cheaper option because paying the premium will payoff with all the listed advantages. Sure Corsair might not be fully there yet but they are in the best position to become the apple of streaming/gaming.

&#x200B;

* PC market share has been shrinking for a very long time. Obviously because of CV19 PC sales rose this and the last year but ex virus years PC market share has been shrinking every year since 2016. While PC market share is shrinking its being replaced by laptops, consoles and most importantly mobile phones. This is important because laptops and consoles have less components that Corsair can sell to those gamers. PC gamers are likely to purchase Corsair's case, PSU, RAM, internal RGB systems and more. Laptop and console gamers will only buy controllers and headphones (if even that much).
* Nobody (on Reddit that is) has mentioned cloud gaming when writing about Corsair. Cloud gaming is the single biggest bear case for Corsair. Yes, I know that most people in 3rd world countries like USA don't have sufficiently fast internet yet, but it will happen, people will have fast internet speeds eventually. On the other side of the coin, game streaming infrastructure is already in very very good position and is only limited by user's internet speed. In this scenario you only need good monitor to play latest games on max settings. This would devastate Corsair and frankly it will happen the only question in when.
* You mentioned that they don't have a moat but their brand is well regarded. Well their brand is their moat and its not a narrow moat either. Yes, they sell generic hardware with Corsair sticker on it. However, because of that sticker they are able to sell generic hardware with huge markup while OEM vendors have to compete on lower price selling exactly the same stuff. That's moat and its moat that takes decades to build. Otherwise, you could say that Coke has no moat. After all, it taste almost the same as store brand beverage.
* Speaking of previous point, for hardware manufacturer they have very good profit margins. 6% net margin for hardware vendor is really not bad.
* Selling PC hardware is cyclical business but they are taking initiatives to diversify. For examples, they have services branch where they sell esports coaching services. They are also working on building some SAAS product but it is not clear yet what it is. If it wakes off it could really help to reduce business criticality and improve profits forecastability.
* They are also positioning themselves as the go-to streaming hardware vendor. Streaming is exploding in popularity so this is large TAM that they could be dominant players in.

So just few extra points above but overall I agree with what you wrote. For disclose, I dont have Corsair positions because I'm not retarded.",Ironleg01,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ot8wlv/crying_over_your_heavy_crsr_bags_then_this_is_the/h6v4zcc/,0.036,0.799,0.164,0.9967

311,DD," Great points thanks for sharing.

Regarding your first comment about the Q1 earnings - I do say this in the DD in the Conclusion section. But I do agree with you fully.

Agree on the iCUE sync with all their RGB, although i'd point out that this is not exclusive to Corsair. NZXT for example have a pretty similar software/sync setup with their products called NZXTCAM. The software is just as good, syncs all RGB components and provides overclocking abilities and system statistics too.

I currently use iCUE with my current rig that has Corsair components, but actually prefer the NZXT equivelent, the software is cleaner and easier to use imo. But in terms of functionality they basically do the same thing.

Also Razr have similar software called Razer Synapse, i've not used it on a desktop case or anything but have used it on their laptops, it's quite powerful in terms of the RGB effects you can do and stuff.",Limewire-,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ot8wlv/crying_over_your_heavy_crsr_bags_then_this_is_the/h6tw70s/,0.018,0.792,0.189,0.9843

And regarding the rebrands - yes agree too.

This will make crsr more attractive for things like pension funds etc who I'm not sure if they even can legally buy into majority controlled companies.

After the delisting threat by the US against Chinese companies, China got really sick of companies being affected by American trade war bullshit. That's a sword of Damocles hanging over their heads that's introducing too much risk.

The CPC wants to take away control over who can and can't invest invest in Chinese companies from the US. It wants companies to start either double listing or only listing on Chinese exchanges and probably wants to make it easier for foreigners to invest on Chinese exchanges.

It makes no sense that Chinese companies are listed on American exchanges anyway if China has the capabilities to build up their own major exchanges to challenge NYSE/NASDAQ.

Could you elaborate on how either of those is more expensive than a $7 fee?

Here's my understanding of the two scenarios:  
1. I place a buy limit order for AAPL at $53 a single share. I pay $7 whether this is fulfilled or cancelled. So I might get a share or I might not, but either way I'm charged $7. Luckily my order is fulfilled and I have one share of AAPL for $60.  


2. I place a buy limit order for AAPL at $53 a share with Robinhood for no fee. Robinhood sells this order data instantly to every HFT firm in the world. They scheme and find some shares of AAPL trading for <$53 a share. They buy one of these shares for $52.

3. I don’t think it prevents counterfeiting cards, but I agree it would make it more difficult, and likely more costly to get a counterfeit card.

Basically, China only needs to occasionally posture about something, Americans freak out and paper hand out of every single stock, private equity buys the dip, China recants, stocks recover/soar and Americans have less money in Chinese stocks while Chinese hold more of their own stocks. Also feels super convenient the price tanked before at least 2 of the major Chinese companies report earnings next month.

I believe it's more like 90%.  Whatever the correct number is, you need to be a net seller to make money with options.  Covered calls have worked best for me.  Put spreads are a distant second (barely profitable for me this year).

My cost basis in AMC as of now is about $36k.  Of that, half is from the proceeds of covered calls.  I've been able to build my position from 300 to 2,000.  Not all of the increase in my position is from covered calls, but a lot is.

That would put MU trading at 6.5x earnings. Not gonna happen. Their business is exploding and their overall memory market is growing fast.

After 2.5 years of my roth doing nothing for me (total value % gains in pic) I got into trading (blue arrow) and quickly into options (red arrow) after that.  Now I'm busy winning with volatility (and VALE) and researching how to protect my shit when the market tanks unless I can make enough to buy a house when the housing market turns.

[Imgur](https://imgur.com/na8h8Xb)

I can risk losing my entire Roth, its a small part of my retirement and I'm young but these gains are from utilizing 50% of the total value while the other half is still sitting in the account as cash to buy dips.

Between consolidation and suppressed demand I like LYV's long term prospects - it has the resources to weather the storm and use it as an opportunity to grow even more.

From a covid perspective I don't see the USA going into lockdowns again, as long as vaccines are effective the elephant in the room that no one's saying out loud is no one gives a shit if the unvaccinated retards choose a slow, miserable death.
