It became something else (well, unpredictable).

There is a reason they say the markets can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent.  It's very likely that those funds short on GME can afford to just keep servicing the debt ledger indefinitely at stupid low interest rates, and never actually realize their perceived losses.  

When you're talking about that many billions... the rules of the system can always be influenced/changed/gamed.  That's the nature of money in the modern world.

Finance your calls by selling earnings month put spreads with the higher strike at the PT above and the lower strike at the current price.

You are knowingly skewing your source. Please stop misquoting your own source to serve your purposes and lets have an unbiased discussion. Name calling and saying someone is outright "" wrong AF"" is a terrible way to go about it.

Your source says from other livestock not ""other food productions"" without even mentioning fake meat or an analysis of it.  You had to deliberately change this btw. Stuff like this makes most people sick rather than directly quoting your own source. Please stop being disingenuous, no one cares who is right or wrong here, except egotistical pricks.

60,APR," This is an extremely logical take if we truly end up going into a deleveraged cycle in the economy (recession).

High Inflation would mean more expensive Teslas (due to increase in cost to procure and produce) + higher APR when borrowing. Less people are going to buy a Tesla because its out of peoples affordability. 

I think it's still too early for Tesla to license out their tech since there aren't too many well known competitors at it's scale (other than OGs) so I feel a dump of some sort is inevitable.

69,FSD," I look at it from a much wider field of view, having been through many market corrections. I have seen values of cars, Rolexes, houses, rims, stereos all climb - fall - and repeat. 

I have seen two products in my time that were revolutionary - things I identified as both product-changing, and market/industry-changing. 

The first was the first-gen iPod, a $500 device that was amazing - but also took down the music industry as we knew it. I bought 10K of APPL during that time when I could hardly afford an iPod. I sold that investment to put it into Nintendo when the Wii came out. A 40M mistake. 

The only other product that came close was my Tesla cars. I drive 40K miles a year. Have only been in the shop once outside of tires. With the federal rebate and 4K in fuel savings plus near-zero maintenance - it has been an eye-opening experience.

If Tesla can sell a 40K car with a 10K rebate, it is a deal any way you slice it. If they can launch a 25K car with a 10K rebate - it is game over for most other manufactures - especially if costs keep declining as they seem to be.

83,TSLA," I disagree. If BUrry wanted to make a bet on inflation and rising rates he could just short Treasury bonds (Which he has done using puts on $TLT and calls on inverse leverage ETFs that short Treasury bond futures). From their 13-F:

TSLA PUT SIZE: 800,100 SHARE VALUE: 534,411,000

TLT PUT SIZE: 1,266,400 SHARE VALUE: 171,534,000

There is no reason to make a proxy bet against an individual business when you can bet against assets that are more directly affected by rising rates and inflation. (Like TLT, an ETF that tracks US Treasury bonds, which decrease in value when inflation rises or rates rise). He is betting against Tesla because the only reason they make money is by selling enviromental credits they get from the govt to other businesses. They would still be bleeding money if it were not for Uncle Sam's generosity. 

&#x200B;

It is possible that Tesla is a good long-term play (just like Amazon expanded from books to cloud hosting maybe Tesla will expand from an EV company to an Energy company). I believe at least somewhat in reflexivity, but none of this changes the fact that Tesla as it stands today is not a genuinely profitable business and they can not stand on their own feet. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: The bet against Tesla is not a bet on rising interest rates. Burry could just buy more TLT puts if that was his intention. The bet against Tesla is due to their reliance on government handouts to stay in the green.",Norre1,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nosznl/people_are_missing_the_point_on_burrys_534m_tesla/h02fvt5/,0.03,0.845,0.125,0.9452

Nearly every equity analysis desk on the street values companies by discounting 10-15 years of intensive FCF projections of companies to the present.

I was with you until your last sentence claiming “Meaning the effect on the WACC from changing interest rates tends to be fairly negligible across the growth portion of the equities market”.

Look into the power grid limitations around at-home charging, most residential areas in the US would have rolling blackouts if more than 10% of homes tried to charge EVs overnight. Basically the entire power grid has to be rebuilt to fix this, in addition to building new power plants to handle the demand.

All of this on top of the problems with battery technology. We've been working on batteries for almost 150 years at this point and have yet to make a significant breakthrough.

The ironic thing is that on Tesla’s way up people kept talking about how other manufacturers make more cars, but now that Tesla has capacity for 1 million cars per year this year (and 2-3 million starting next year) that argument has gotten much quieter. Meanwhile the Fords and GMs are in the tens of thousands or low hundred thousands for several years at least. The EVs are much higher margin than ICE are for the traditional automakers so it’s not a good comparison. 

Besides that^ somewhat obvious point, Tesla also has much more software revenue (much of which hasn’t been realized yet) as well as an energy business that is growing rapidly (solar, home storage batteries, grid storage batteries, etc). Lastly Tesla has unique partnerships/relationships that give them unique advantages in materials, technologies, opportunities, etc such as SpaceX, Boring Company, etc. The steel alloy used in the gigapresses was developed in tandem with SpaceX so it’s not easy for other companies to replicate with undoing the majority of their manufacturing approach.

141,ICE," No technology on that large of scale has ever switched that quickly. Monetary theory does not equal real world practical application.

The infrastructure to support that many EVs doesn't exist either. You guys may know markets but I know cars. Mechanics trained properly, charging stations to support our current roadways, parts availability, and most importantly the ability to work on them at home. None of that exists. How in five years is that possible? 

Plus consider the collector and legacy markets. No one is in danger of holding an ICE bag any time soon. That's the equivalent of saying there are railroad bag holders because of semis.

147,GM," Yeah I’m not saying they will, but this is why Tesla has an advantage. EVs are higher margin and Tesla has a much larger production capacity entirely focused on them. The traditional automakers won’t want to shut down existing manufacturing to retool so it’ll slow down their transition. They’ll get there but they’ll be the smaller manufacturers compared to Tesla once it’s a fully EV market closer to 2030/2035. Tesla also has the lowest net debt position out of the major automakers so they have a cash advantage as well.

https://www.statista.com/statistics/541390/global-sales-of-plug-in-electric-vehicle-manufacturers/

By the time GM, Ford, etc are able to make 1M EVs per year, Tesla will be able to make 5M or more. It’s a trend that will continue given Tesla’s time/cash/focus advantage.

153,ICE," 2019 was one of the largest years ever for auto auctions. 2020 screwed to much for me judge anything. Classic cars get younger every year. You are correct there are fewer C2 vettes and such, miatas, mustangs etc are becoming classic every year. That doesn't go away it grows at the same curve of production overall. Classic cars change some become collectors some don't. 

I've been hearing about battery improvements since highschool shop. The one that will make easy charging and longer trips just around the corner. The fall of air travel means increase in road travel. That's why infrastructure matters. Almost no one will buy an EV as a daily just to replace a working ICE. When the ICE dies, then maybe, if they are better and cheaper than a new or used good reliable ICE.

No working on one from home isn't necessary but ahuge part of the automotive market and your talking a market switch to a new tech. It matters. Nit to mention either training or retraining ICE techs and mechanics to EV techs and mechanics. That matters. Trying welding body work on a Tesla without proper training, lots of entertainment on YouTube. Retraining a workforce takes time, even longer with a currently advancing technology. 

Overall it's your money and your theory. I just think most investors don't consider the actual market for ICE.
 They get wrapped around the axle and judge only on balance sheets of the big four. Things won't, and can't move fast enough to change to a new conveyance as quickly as most bullish investors keep saying. There are huge profits to be made in the space on individual companies but it gets conflated. Tesla doing well and big four doing not as well does not equal the end of ICE or a take over by EV.

155,BEST," > I believe the number of Nissan leafs being sold is going down year over year since 2013ish

So what? My point is that many consumers are happy with the electric cars they've bought, which were cheaper than Teslas and met their needs.

As for the rest of your post, you just sound like a fanboy. ""MY CAR COMPANY MAKES THE BEEEST CARS EVERY OTHER EV SUCKS111!!!"" Just listen to yourself, have you driven in every single electric vehicle on the market? Have you even read about Audi's driver assist tech, or are you another cultist who ignores the competition?

If I was to take your bizarre fanboy delusion as fact (which I don't, lots of people are very happy with their non-Tesla EVs), we're left with a statement that says ""Tesla is the gold standard"". Take a look outside, does everyone drive a BMW? Do they drive Porsches and brand new Mercedes Benz's? Do they all drive Bentleys?

Fuck no, about a third drive the cheapest piece of shit they can get, the next third buy something in the middle like a pre-owned Ford, and then a third get something fancy like a new Range Rover.

Does your investment decision rely on the prediction that suddenly the whole world will say ""I'M ONLY GOING TO BUY A TOP OF THE LINE TESLA, NOTHING INFERIOR FOR ME, ONLY THE BEST, AND I WILL PAY TOP DOLLAR FOR IT"".

To summarise:

* No, Teslas are not ""objectively"" the best EVs, ""best car"" is a matter of opinion, and lots of people are happy with their Audis.

* People are perfectly happy to buy cheaper cars. We're not all consoooooomers, some of us just want to reliably get from A->B in a comfy chair.",Nihilonium,10,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nosznl/people_are_missing_the_point_on_burrys_534m_tesla/h02jt7r/,0.077,0.782,0.14,0.9641

224,BB," Buy shares at this price and some ITM calls for a later date. I’ve come to learn that stocks in our “meme” category as manipulated to fleece money from retail on option yolos. You essentially can’t lose money if you keep buying the shares and plan to exercise a few deeper ITM calls in 3 months. Buy a few and sell them down the line for a profit to have the liquidity to exercise the remaining. 

BB is a Great long term investment. 23/24 largest auto manufacturers will use QNX. That’s so bullish nothing else needs to be said. 

I have $7C’s and sure the premium might be a little more expensive right now but I guarantee I will not regret this come sept/oct as I sell a few of them for profit to exercise 3. 

Nxt 3 months also gives me time to save liquidity to exercise. And then go into future BB with a few hundred shares",TheInternetTrader,10,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/non0so/bb_to_the_baby/h01so30/,0.022,0.819,0.159,0.9645

226,AMC," Let me tell you why BB is the play:
1. GME and AMC already has runs, not saying the runs are over but they’ve had some runs. BB has yet to run. This is surprising as its grouped with the meme stocks.
2. BB market cap is a third of GME and half of AMC, so it’s that much easier to double.
3. GME has a reason to run up, AMC I don’t really know the reason...no hate here. BB is a real stock with real implication. If it wasn’t called BB it would be 100+ by now.

https://investorplace.com/2021/05/blackberry-by-any-other-name-would-have-a-much-higher-valuation/

4. BB has been flat for months now. It has found its support. It should not go much lower from what it’s priced at now. So a bottom of 8$ and a high of 25+ that’s a no brainer. The risk is asymmetrical. I would buy shares because we don’t know when it will blow up, but when it dos there will be serious FOMO.
5. BB is the 2nd most mentioned ticker on this sub and it hasn’t even gone up yet (or gone down), it hasn’t even made its move!!!

Some people lost 75 percent on BB calls they bought Friday at the peak. Be careful. Read the doc and I have a guide for newbies linked in the doc. 

Don’t get caught up with fomo. Ease in. If you don’t make money here make it on the next stock. But getting blown out early in your trading career leaves a bitter taste. Learn the skills to do this long term. Please be careful.

I set a high limit sell order for most of them and when they went really high briefly they sold. I basically over doubled my money within the week. Had a few shares left and bought in some more when it came down a bit. Then it really went down so I was a loss on those, but overall still ahead. So I averaged down. Then I learned about options. I want to hang onto them so I bought more to get a lot and sold a covered call. Price went down more so I bought another lot, then another.

355,ETSY," The thing about WISH is that it IPOed at the same time investors began to move their money away from e-commerce. After every company that had “e-commerce” as part of their operations increased 2x in 2020 (AMZN, ETSY, SHOP, SEA, etc), investors reaped the profits and began to sell their positions at the beginning of 2021. That’s why the e-commerce market as a whole has dropped about 30% since Feb 2021. 

Although Wish fell with the rest of e-commerce, it never had the original increase that needed to be “corrected”. So, this means that Wish is currently insanely undervalued, as many others have stated here. If you’re looking for an e-commerce play, this is the best one I’ve found in terms of growth potential and value.

Both of these can result in shares being legitimized by the voting process when people transfer to a different broker, or by voting regularly through on places like Robinhood. Plain and simple it's the sheer volume of shares either shorted and not covered, and shares sold short and not accounted for OR covered that will make more shares than are available- shares which become legitimized by voting, then go into the voting count that will be higher than available, actual shares.

Watch how OBV correlates price in every single one of them, then go check out the meme stocks.  As initially skeptical - I scoured other securities to find anything more disconnected from its OBV than gamestop, and came up with nothing.

The 2012 movie ‘The Wall Street Conspiracy’ documents the media involvement in the Overstock case in great detail.  An anonymous tip to then CEO Patrick Byrne detailed exactly what was going to happen, and by which reporters as well.  I don’t buy into alex jones gay frog foil hat type wacko stuff at all - but this shit actually happened, and not only involves media manipulation but implicates major broker / dealers as well.  It is a must-watch for anyone looking to get a better understanding of the issues at hand.

All the earmarks of these other well documented stocks being abusively sold short - are present on GME.  Ftd’s, media telling us daily to ‘forget gamestop’ - as well as the involvement of the same usual suspects.  The only difference this time, is the target isn’t dying a quiet death.

> 1) (AR p.101) In audit opinion it is stated that revenue recognition (Principal Vs Agent) was a subject to both management and audit judgement. If auditors were sure about correctness of revenue recognition, they wouldn’t mention it.

 Yes, they would. A huge deal about FS is to not mislead, so they have to *disclose* stuff. They tested revenue, since its like, the most important part of the FS and most likely to be gamed

> 2.) If you review contract terms (section 5) between Stripe, who is processing payments for Shopify, you will see that the whole responsibility and control over payments is on Stripe. In this case Stripe is a principle.

 This doesnt sound like how principal vs agent works. Principal is like, employees of the company, i.e. the company itself Agent is people doing shit on company's behalf

> 3) If you look at the balance sheet (AR p.102) and note 10 (AR p.122) Shopify simply doesn’t have assets (Property, plant and equipment) to process payments, It literally has no infrastructure. You can’t tell me that 9.3 mln. worth computer equipment can generate 3 bln. revenue for a company with >5000 workers.

Yes, you dont need buildings or desk furniture to process payments. A publically traded client of mine went fully remote this past year, and disposed of basically all their PPE. They could also be leasing stuff, which would not be classified under fixed assets

> Despite have that Shopify claims that they have more sales than WIX, the deferred revenue balance of SHOPIFY is less than WIX’s. Maybe WIX is receiving fees more in advance than SHOPIFY, but SHOPIFY has a ratio of amount of deferred revenue to revenue equal to 1 to 27. Meaning that it asks to pay fees more often than every 2 weeks. This is very unlikely since the standard period is minimum one month. The thing is that even the absolute number is lower than WIX, not just percentage.

Deferred revenue is money that has been received, but not earned yet, so they didnt ""do the thing"" or complete their service yet for it to be ""earned"" and be actual revenue yet

 > SHOPIFY spends hundreds of millions on research and development. But we don’t see any increase in intangible assets or PPE. Why a company that uses creative accounting to show good sales is not using it to capitalize R&D expenses and show higher profit? In my opinion, because those expenses aren't R&D but Cost of sales.

expensed vs capitalization has to do with ""will we see a future economic benefit"" i.e. do we have an asset? R&D costs are required to be expensed under GAAP because we dont know if these costs will provide a future economic benefit. Once you obtain a patent, or something like that you value it's future economic benefit, and it goes on the balance sheet as an intangible.

You can’t tell me that 9.3 mln. worth computer equipment can generate 3 bln. revenue for a company with >5000 workers.

Why not?  If they use hosted cloud infrastructure then any of the 'normal' spending on PPE would be listed as an expense or COG.  If there was no corresponding increasing in a different account then this would be a flag but just looking at a single account doesn't create an issue by itself.  Further, they could be setting their CapEx threshold over the cost of their computers/laptops so that laptops/computers they buy for employees are accounted for as expenses instead of PPE allowing their PPE account be effectively $0 for their size.

> 5) Despite have that Shopify claims that they have more sales than WIX, the deferred revenue balance of SHOPIFY is less than WIX’s. Maybe WIX is receiving fees more in advance than SHOPIFY, but SHOPIFY has a ratio of amount of deferred revenue to revenue equal to 1 to 27. Meaning that it asks to pay fees more often than every 2 weeks. 

Not sure how that is suggested from the ratio.  If a company has a single revenue source and it charges monthly for a monthly subscription then its deferred revenue could be fairly reported as $0 (you could argue that they cannot fully recognize it until the end of the month but then they could also be recognize parts of it daily too).  You only really end up seeing significant deferred revenue if a company charges multiple months upfront.  Now Shopify also has other revenue streams as well outside of its subscription model with subscriptions making up only ~33%.  Assuming the rest of their revenue does not generate any significant deferred revenue (it probably doesn't given it is non-subscription based), you can redo the ratio calculation using just the subscription revenue and come up with a non-problematic number.

> (AR p.103) SHOPIFY spends hundreds of millions on research and development. But we don’t see any increase in intangible assets or PPE.

Still a good alternative and component. There is a reason they've always been slower and cheaper but could be competent with Intel.

Now it doesn't matter as much if you sell most your shit to miners because you can tweak the chips to be specifically good at that one thing and not worry about performance across the board.

757,SNV," Actually although a consistent growth of 74% for 10 years may be a bit much (not by much imo), but his opex projections are EXTREMELY conservative, nullifying the implication of yours that the 1.8B in profit in 2030 alone or any of the net income estimations are unlikely to happen or its estimation fanciful.  
  
here is your proof -  
  
  
  
He is projecting 65% CAGR for OPEX with a 25% CAGR for additional costs  
  
Bionano's CFO, ""opex is going to be up in this year. I don't think it's going to be staggering. I'd say somewhere in the 20% to 40% range this year. And then I would probably keep it in that range for the next couple of years' growth, that range.""  
  
Also an analyst recently projected a similar DCF model and he had additional costs at a flat 0% rate, so that tells you how conservative Ragnaros' actually is.  
  
Also CFO has said numerous times that 2021 YOY revenue growth will be 'substantial double digit growth' and factor in nanonozzle and their 'global saphyr adoption' goals plus the fact thatCMA, FISH, KT are all absolutely dogshit compared to Saphyr IF you actually know the tech-cost effective, less hands on time, faster turnaround time, AND easier to learn and use. PLUS LOH and SNV detection is in the works according to managment. AND $100 PER GENOME is coming soon. We also have a saphyr 2.0 with a 14x higher throughput and nanonozzle which is essentially confirmed (imo)

It's very rough, yes, but I don't know of anything else to adequately capture it's relative market. Knowing people that work in genomics labs and having a wife that has a PhD in BioChemistry that also spent time in a genomics lab, the real world workers all believe that it not only could be huge, but is bigger than people outside the actual labs think.

818,PM," People who want to own PMs should hold in physical. I can't see wanting to pay for a piece of paper saying you own some PM in a vault somewhere.  Especially if everyone agrees there's a shortage and prices are high.  Too tempting for people to say they have your PMs when they don't.

822,TV," I think a big over-looked aspect of Vizio's growth forecast is the mainstream acceptance soundbars have been gaining each year.

Vizio has, by far, the best cost to quality Atmos soundbars out there. As TV speakers get worse and worse, and soundbars get more and more popular, I believe Vizio will continue to capture a higher percentage of this market.",GratefulDave93,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/np6amt/a_quick_glance_at_vzio/h03wyyj/,0.087,0.689,0.224,0.8676
823,TV," I gotta say I agree with u/ODCTD. I know my experience with Vizio TVs is purely anecdotal, but I think Roku makes a much better product. I purchased a new Vizio TV this past October for $300. The only app that runs smoothly is Netflix, but it will still sometimes freeze and require a reset. All of the other apps are incredibly laggy, especially prime video. It’s completely unusable. I ended up buying chromecast because it was so unbearable. The TV itself is good quality, but Vizio’s UI has major issues. You can buy a Roku tv for cheaper, and you won’t need to spend the extra $$ for a chromecast or Apple TV add-on.",whoreads23,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/np6amt/a_quick_glance_at_vzio/h04hchl/,0.0,0.903,0.097,0.8674

825,CRT," As far as TV's go Vizios ares shit. I have three, and everyone of them have issues. First off the OS is shit or needs a bigger processor. The apps lag severely and often get stuck making me have to restart three TV. Occasionally Netflix or Hulu won't load, that requires a hard reset.

I had one in perfect condition quit working, I took apart and the board with all the inputs went bad. You can't get parts for 4 year old Vizios. Only used if you're lucky. What else? The TVs turn themselves off  in the middle of a show. 📉
