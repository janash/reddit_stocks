84,GME," Why I Like the Stock: A Personal Anecdote

I have a monthly subscription for my dog's stupid expensive prescription food, through Chewy. Had a notification it was delivered on the 26th - but it's nowhere to be found. Emailed Chewy and let them know on Sunday the 29th.
Less than 10 minutes after sending that message, I got an email saying a new shipment was on its way. Immediately followed by an email from a customer service rep apologizing and letting me know they sent a replacement free of charge. Fucking rad, that's some of the quickest and best customer service I've ever gotten online. 

BUT THEN. The package showed up (on a neighbor's porch. They don't like me very much so they hid it for a couple days I guess). 

I emailed Chewy back and told them it was here, apologized, and asked them to cancel the new order if it's not too late. They replied (again, insanely quickly), saying it was probably too late to cancel, but ""we would greatly appreciate it if you took the time to donate the food to a local animal shelter or rescue.""

If this is the attitude and service that Ryan Cohen (and now more of his Chewy cohorts) are bringing to GME, I am all fucking in.",nodrog115,206,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mgewny/gme_megathread_for_march_30_2021/gst4b1v/,0.06,0.877,0.062,0.3414

170,DD," After reading the DD about hedge funds abusing the MMs ability to create phantom shares for puts as a hedge I took a look at monthly maturities for contracts.

Pretty much every single monthly maturity has a put to call ratio of 3+ and they're all for under $10 normally around 60k contracts but 07/16/2021 has a ratio of 6.7 and 170k contacts for a $10 strike.

I am thinking they purchased these contacts as gme was approaching $10 to use the phantom shares to short gme and then execute the puts and use those shares to cover their shorts and then they just continue the process.

As these $10 are all going to expire worthless I am assuming they are going to have to start buying shares to cover the phantom shares they shorted? I am also thinking they don't have the capital to pay premium to create more phantom shares this way.

Thoughts?

EDIT: I'm pretty high, most don't have a ratio of 3+, still looks off though the ones with loads of $10 strike puts",SuboptimalStability,31,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mgewny/gme_megathread_for_march_30_2021/gsug8dk/,0.057,0.795,0.148,0.9456

305,GME," very well said. It's crazy I have a lot of ""smart"" friends or family who just ignore this or pretend everything is fine and that GME going up is just a magical thing with nothing behind it. I mean yeah.... I sound like a conspiracy nut sometimes explaining it but a lot of it boils down to just blankley trusting the market or not. It's like..... do you not remember 2008? And all these other financial crashes. Walstreet and big money have lied before you think they just all of a sudden stopped? REALLY? Now whose being fucking naïve. I mean hell.... had a buddy link me a fucking CNBC article the other day. I have seen with my own eyes CNBC blatantly lie about GME this entire time. It doesn't take that much research to see this thing.

So fuck it. I might sound crazy at times but this whole thing just seems plain as day to me. Yes....... it helps GME is actually transitioning into a real company again. Yes this has gone on a lot longer than I expected. But I personally vastly underestimated Big monies power to manipulate the market. But I am here for when it comes crashing down on top of them and await the payout. I will not rub it in the face of those who didn't invest I can see why. But I will no longer feel guilty about not telling people and them missing out on the gains.

That’s all I can think about. Everyone who has made this breakout prediction up until this date has been wrong. But daily someone has a reason as to why the next breakout will happen and daily it doesn’t.

One day it will, one day it will be right, we will see. I’m not sure about most things as I don’t know a lot and won’t be doing my DD on this specific instance, but seeing these breakout predictions is getting awkward.

If it’s similar to the VW squeeze we are looking at $30k/share. But that was only 15% short interest and the shorts were given a break. I suspect we will see prices greater than $100k. How high? No clue.

I don’t see how this doesn’t result in a massive market correction.

555,GME," It's true that short selling acts as useful price-discovery mechanism but his conclusion is dead wrong.

He states that people are being prevented from short selling, without asking *why*. The reason why it's incredibly difficult to short GME is that it's **so shorted nobody wants to take on the additional risk facilitating a short because the liquidity is so low they know that when/if the shorts get margin called they will be left holding the bag**. This is why some brokers are enforcing 300-400% collateral, because they know that if a short gets margin called there won't be enough liquidity to buy back the shares, so they are giving themselves a buffer of 3-4x that amount.

 So, if we take a step back, given that the stock already shorted more than should be possible (without committing fraud) **and** that the price is soaring, the only logical conclusion is that the price is lower than it should be by orders of magnitude.

I don't know how much I believe that.

561,GME," Shorts cause the bag to be held by more people though. Every short is another ""share"" for an investor to buy. Let the investors realize that their investment sucks and eventually there will be more sellers than buyers and the price will fall naturally.

That should be common knowledge. Supply-demand is also common knowledge. And that's how stocks would work without shorts. 

It's easy for retail to understand that GME can buyback 30M shares so that each share is entitled to more earnings and more revenue and is thus more valuable. There is less supply but same demand theoretically, resulting in increasing price. What retail can't understand is that hedgies can go short 30M more shares to keep the share supply the same.. This is where we need protections for investors. You shouldn't be able to manipulate the stock price to this large of an extent.

The only shares created or eliminated should be by the company itself, not people providing ""liquidity"".

If you believe GME is worth X in the long run, shortsellers are making it worth less, giving you a discount in the value when you buy it.

So in a land where GME is a reasonable investment, you'd hope shortsellers get as many stocks to short as they can, and just line your pockets with their money as they're selling the stocks at too cheap a price.

If you don't believe stock is worth by itself $190, then you're an idiot for buying it at $190. Shortsellers just make money out of your stupidity.

You buy $100 stock. it goes up $5 you sell it (gain $105 Minus your cost of $100) you pay tax on $5

Simple enough.

You buy and sell the same stock constantly. you gain $5 10 times and lose $5 10 times. mathematically you are even but because of this literal bullshit rule each of those $5 gains counts as income and you are not allowed to DEDUCT from them each of the $5 losses. so to the IRS you have a $50 gain ($5 times 10 positive trades) and you are now allowed to counts the $50 loss ($5 times 10 Negative trades)

618,IRS," So if I understand this correctly... As long as I sell for a net profit after the adjusted cost basis, I will be good?

e.g. if I bought 10 shares at $15 (10 x $15 = $150), sold at $10 each ($100) for $5 loss each, and bought back 10 at $8 each ($80), my adjusted total cost basis would be $(80 + 5\*10) = $130. My adjusted cost basis per share is $13.

So

1. If I sold before the share price reaches $13, say at $10, my taxable amount would still be calculated like a gain: $(10-8)\*10 = $20; i.e. I owe the IRS taxes on a technical net loss.
2. But if I sold at $13, I break even and owe no taxes.
3. If I sold above $13, say $15, I pay taxes on $(15-13)\*10 = $20, but I also covered my initial cost?

619,IRS," That's what I don't get, it's just extra steps. The benefits I can think of for the IRS are 1) less losses claimed on Dec31, so simplified accounting (for now!), and 2) tax revenue *now* is better than tax revenue *later*. It's the same tax revenue, but they get to nab it earlier.

Also, think about that fella in the article: He'll pay $800k in taxes this year. Next year he'll get to effectively claim $800k in losses via increased cost basis, but with an $800k tax bill due *now* he'll have to liquidate everything to pay up... there won't be a next year for his portfolio. So they get to limit your actions, claim taxes *now* instead of later, and if you fuck up, they... end your trading career? Eliminating a tax revenue stream?

621,AAPL," I think I figured it out, wash sales apply to buying a similar security to replace the one you claim a loss on.

So buying on 12/30 is not a replacement purchase, so no wash sale is triggered.

The ""30 days before"" is important to specify so someone can't get around wash sales by simply buying the same amount of stock right before selling the stock. For example, buy 100 shares AAPL on 12/15, buy 100 replacement shares on 12/29, then sell your first 100 shares on 12/30. The wash sale would trigger and apply the new cost basis to the 12/29 shares you are holding.

Also, wash sales are done intelligently. If you buy 200 shares of AAPL, sell 200, then rebuy 100; you get to claim losses on the 100 and the other half carries over as cost basis.

In conclusion, the only thing to care about is if you are making many wash sales and carrying a large cost basis to the next year while realizing fake gains this year. This is how you get stuck paying heavy gain taxes in 1 year and having many losses to claim in the next; like the guy in the article.",jwonz_,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mg5c2e/45000_profit_with_a_800000_tax_bill_lmao/gsrzlll/,0.071,0.795,0.134,0.9008

629,CCI," **Updated [graph w/ channel](https://imgur.com/a/hIdAWAz) as of 2:48pm**

It’s been testing the support since noon so don’t be surprised if shorts are fired and the price dips. It’s all part of the game.

**Update 12:58pm:** It’s broken the support twice since posting, but quickly re-entered the channel both times. CCI(20) dipped to -200 and quickly topped 230; volatility is picking up from the past hour, with volume up from noon as well. Usually GME has stalled out on low volume past 11am-noon so this is a good sign. Hoping to close around $190, last time we closed above $190 was 3/18.

**Update 1:12pm:** Volume has picked up and the [price has spiked](https://imgur.com/a/Qbob22C) to $195. A breakout point in the channel would be around $197-$199 in the next 10 minutes.

**Update 1:45pm:** With the support being tested multiple times and the quick shoot upward at 1:10, it was beginning to look like the trend within channel had been broken. However, it seems as if the support is still holding as it dips right now. Expecting a reversal and upward trend in the next 10-20 mins because of the very negative CCI. If we reach $200 today I expect a lot of shorts to be fired, possibly even closing red. Hold on folks.

**Update 2:07pm:** Seems like my hunch about a reversal was right. Closing in on 200! Let’s see what happens. Right now 200 is within the channel, but I could see the channel quickly becoming irrelevant if we break this milestone. After all the channel is just a rough estimate of where to expect the peaks and dips.

**Update 2:32pm:** We brushed $200.16 at 2:29, though I am surprised to see the lack of a major dip. It may be too early to say. A wild guess of mine is that with the recent liquidation of HFs and today’s good news, shorts may just be running out of bullets, considering today’s steady growth and lack of major dips. But who can say for sure. Definitely a significant day for GME.

**Update 2:44pm:** Now comfortably sitting at 200+. Volume will likely pickup and I don’t see the channel holding for much longer with the added volatility. Remember, we can’t save our friends in the 200s if you paperhand now. Patience!

**Update 2:47pm:** Currently [testing the resistance](https://imgur.com/a/hIdAWAz) for the first time today along the 200s.

**Update 2:57pm:** Looks like we’re staying in the channel still. Current descent doesn’t look too significant, wouldn’t worry about a large dip unless we fall below $195, a couple dollars below the support right now.

**Update 3:12pm:** Quick dip below support. Seems to be rebounding with $195 being a new floor of sorts (2:10-2:20 shows this). Market data showed a lot of buying pressure at $196. Whether this holds the rest of today or not, only time will tell. I wouldn’t dismiss the possibility of shorts being fired before close.

**Update 3:18pm:** Buy the dip and hold on! Wee!

669,AMC," LOL, ""un-researched FUD"". This comes straight from the company's SEC filings. You can read them all in the link at the bottom, but you'd probably just prefer to follow sentiment blindly. Not really sure where I've ever referenced a motley fool article either, but whatever. 

I'm not saying that the vote to release another 5 million shares is definitive. What I am saying is they've already released another around 3.5 million shares in the last 6 months. Most of us realize that a stock's price rises with demand which is tied to supply. Take GME for example, it was shorted to 140% of float, and float was around 45 mil (almost 10x less than AMC today, but closer to 2x less four months ago), it didn't take much demand for the price to rise, and for shorts to cover because there weren't that many shares available. Now, we look at AMC, there are roughly 404 mil shares float, with 11% of that volume shorted as of 3/15. This stock peaked in January when there were only 100 mil shares available, and a significant amount of the stock being shorted, it peaked again around the time retail was receiving their stimulus checks. I personally don't see how anyone could hold this stock knowing the intentions of the board members, and the potential for this bubble to pop if they were to release another substantial offering, but to each their own i guess.

Big shocker here: Nearly all stocks follow the same trendline, especially those that are grouped into the same industry ( like entertainment, or meme stocks) **most of the time,** with the exception of certain factors like negative news, additional share offerings, lawsuits, etc. that impact the individual stock.

You think they don't have access to short interest data, and understand the metrics of why a stock might rise or fall?

I wouldn't be so quick to accuse others of spreading FUD, I'm only trying to bring attention to the actual factors that will drive the price up or down in an attempt to warn new investors of the repercussions should there be further dilution.

Then they would be as foolish as most of the people that post the dilution has already happened, because markets don't usually speculate on what happens in a month, but retail investors do! Dilution and equity offerings are typically signs of GROWTH to most of the market, it means partnerships or other company based incentives, but it isn't good for stockholders. Most look at earnings, fundamentals, and annual data. Both AMC and GME are not trading on the fundamentals, one is a theater that risked bankruptcy during a pandemic, the other closed business on very few locations still allowing foot traffic and STILL had to close almost 700 locations; needless to say, none of us are trading fundamentals, it is ALL speculation. Just look at what happened to $GME  when the ""considering additional equity options"" was mentioned. That didn't seem to affect the stock or sentiment all that much, it also isn't being parroted as fact widely, because we all want to believe that Cohen would rather ride bankruptcy than cost us tendies, lol, get real. In fact, with all the big promises Cohen is laying out they would be stupid NOT to introduce shares for equity on those projects, i.e. you lose, Gamestop wins.

822,GS," If you buy derivatives, you’re not really owning any stock; but the party selling you such derivatives must delta hedge, most often by buying/selling sufficient securities to cover their derivative sales. 

In this case, my assumption is that Archegos went bullish on Viacom and Discovery among others (those are two of the best performing stocks year to date) by buying call options and CFDs. GS/MS who sold them the securities had to buy the underlying stocks to hedge. 

My theory is, upon realizing Bill Hwang’s position is vulnerable to various bad news (Viacom dilution, China stocks delisting potential) GS/MS sold their holdings and tank the stock prices, indirectly triggering a margin call on Archegos. This is not unlikely, given what happened in 2008 - when GS rug pulled their fellow bankers at Lehman by selling all their MBS holdings tanking the MBS/CDO market and created the Global financial crisis.",ColdplayUnited,25,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mgg8a7/hwangs_archegos_may_never_even_owned_any_of_the/gssub1b/,0.075,0.822,0.103,0.5719

And let other firms that no one gives a shit about take risks and go under when they blow up. 

What is a “fundamentally good” company is in the eye of the beholder. You’re on a sub that bid up the price of a company that until recently hadn’t made any money in 2 years. Certain Hedge funds thought it was worth less than this sub. They were wrong (at least in the near term) and that’s how price discovery works.

There's a chance they also get regulatory approval by then due to their fleet, they'll only need like a couple weeks to a month to get enough data to turn in. FSD is a fucking game changer, ppl don't think Tesla can do it (or are behind say Waymo lol) and I think they can do it, are about to do it, and are gonna make a shit-load of money off it. At the same time though Tesla will be growing at 80+% for back to back years and revenue and profit margins are about to rocket. FSD will be solved, Berlin, Texas and Shanghai will be killing it...

Edit: you’ll thank yourself later if you just focus on the 850c position and dump everything else... remember keep enough dry powder!

Home 1 sold for $295/sqft. Home 2 sold for $274/sqft. Home 3 sold for $363/sqft. Home 4 sold for $391/sqft. All these houses were built at the same time, homes 1, 3 and 4 have identical layouts. Home 2 was larger but had differed maintenance. Conditions were similar, home 4 was the nicest condition, but still a 30 year old home. 

Brand new construction is $286/sqft MAX.

Anyone notice a problem? Why is a 2000 toyota tacoma with 100k miles worth more than a new one? HINT: it isnt.

But what has happened is appraisal creep has distorted real value. Here is what happens. A home sells say market value of $200/sqft. The next appraiser says $210, and the next $220 and on and on. And eventually we get to overvalued homes. Which we are at now. 

The lenders are just doing their job, the buyers have great credit, good jobs, good economy (if you have a college degree in something useful), so what is the problem? These people can pay their mortgage!

Ok, but what happens when rates rise and their home is now worth $280/sqft and they bought at $380? The cash price of things matters. I don't really understand why lenders are ignoring this. But then again, I didn't understand it in 2006 either.

Buyers are buying a mortgage payment, not a home. They cannot afford their home, only the payment and only for now.

2nd example. My friends just got approved for a mortgage. They make $82000 pre tax combined. The gurus say they should buy a home for about $285-325k for about 1/3 of their income. But they were approved for $460k. Well over 5x their income.

They have perfect credit. They won't after they buy a home @ 5.5x gross income and any life event happens.

This is predatory lending. But to people with good credit. To fuck up a hot economy, greed just...finds a way.",bNoaht,54,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mg7div/alright_i_just_going_to_say_it_because_no_one/gsru7i5/,0.071,0.755,0.174,0.991

1035,OR," Reason to be bearish, you have a lot of ""probablys""  and ""coulds"" in your short paragraph analysis.

The second reason is because no one seems to know who bought the shares. Who would buy the shares over value when the stock has been trading sideways for a month? The only real movement was from the dividend, and the people that reinvested have moved the stock like $0.30. So the institution that bought them is net negative a dollar and some change per share  (11,945,000 - 12,625,000 = -$680,000).

1293,UWMC," I am literally going to spoon feed this to you.  [Warehouse line of credit - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse_line_of_credit#:~:text=A%20warehouse%20line%20of%20credit%20is%20a%20credit,taking%20a%20loan%20application%20from%20the%20property%20buyer.) \- A mortgage company needs money to originate loans. That is why they have lines of credit. They take that money to originate the loan, and then sell it off. And repeat. "" Warehouse lines of credit play an important role in making the mortgage loan market more accessible to property buyers since many mortgage bankers would not be able to attract sufficient amount of deposits that are necessary to fund mortgage loans by themselves. Therefore, warehouse funding allows the loan originators to provide mortgages at more competitive rates.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse_line_of_credit#cite_note-2) Unlike in other types of lending, loan originators earn more profit from origination fees rather than interest rate spread since the closed mortgage loan is sold quickly to an investor. ""

There is a **reason** that when Rocket had its Line of Credit increased, it was seen as a **good** thing. It was widely seen  as a sign of heavy loan volume, and that they needed more money in their credit facility line to originate even **more** loans to take market share, as well as get more revenues (and therefore net income).

[Revolving Debt - A Line of Credit with No Repayment Schedule (corporatefinanceinstitute.com)](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/revolving-debt/) \-  A revolving debt (a “revolver,” also sometimes known as a line of credit, or LOC) does not feature fixed monthly payments. It differs from a fixed payment or term loan that has a guaranteed balance and payment structure. Instead, the payments of revolving debt are based on the balance of credit every month. Interest payments are calculated likewise; payments are based on the interest rate and balance and are often computed daily.

Why don't you read this:

""In addition to warehouse facilities, we are an approved lender for loan early funding facilities with Fannie Mae through its As Soon As Pooled Plus (“ASAP+”) program and Freddie Mac through its Early Funding (“EF”) program. As an approved lender for these early funding programs, we enter into an agreement to deliver closed and funded one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, each secured by related mortgages and deeds of trust, and receive funding in exchange for such mortgage loans in some cases before the lender has grouped them into pools to be securitized by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. All such mortgage loans must adhere to a set of eligibility criteria to be acceptable. As of December 31, 2020, the amount outstanding through the ASAP+ program was approximately $75.9 million and no amounts were outstanding under the EF program. In addition to the arrangements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we are also party to one early funding (or “gestation”) lines with a financial institution. Through this arrangement, we enter into agreements to deliver certified pools consisting of mortgage loans securitized by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and/or Freddie Mac, as applicable, for the gestation line. As with the ASAP+ and EF programs, all mortgage loans under this gestation line must adhere to a set of eligibility criteria.

The gestation line has a transaction limit of $150.0 million, and it is an evergreen agreement with no stated termination or expiration date that can be terminated by either party upon written notice. As of December 31, 2020, no amount was outstanding under this line.As of December 31, 2020, the Company had pledged mortgage loans at fair value as collateral under the above warehouse lines of credit. The above agreements also contain covenants which include certain financial requirements, including maintenance of minimum tangible net worth, minimum liquidity, maximum debt to net worth ratio, net income, and limitations on additional debt, as defined in the agreements. The Company was in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2020.""

There is a reason I gave you the  UWMC Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which you can find on Edgar, and that is because you needed to be spoon fed information. However, clearly you cannot read, so i have gone through the trouble of compiling yet more resources for you. '

I am not twisting financial data, or spreading misinformation. You are just simple.

Let me reiterate:  [Warehouse Lending Definition (investopedia.com)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/warehouse_lending.asp) \->  Warehouse lending is a line of credit given to a loan originator. The funds are used to pay for a mortgage that a borrower uses to purchase property. The life of the loan generally extends from its [origination](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/origination.asp) to the time it is sold on the secondary market either directly or through securitization.

Just stop, i'm not going to keep responding to you. You don't know what you're talking about, and what's more, you don't understand the industry you're speaking about.

Edit:  Honestly.

1370,MO," He gave some theta gange retard 14k to gain all the profits that MO would get from 60,000 shares after it goes above 52$ per share. 

Too retarded? 

He essentially gave some one 14k dollars in a contract. In the contract it says “ALL PROFITS THAT 60,000 shares of MO stock would gain after 52$ share price will be mine before 4/1”. So if MO gets to 53$, his contract activates, 52-53= 1$ but he has 60,000 shares, so he actually gains 60,000$ and he didn’t buy the shares but just paid 14k so the profit is 46k if MO gets to 53$.",JoeWelburg,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mglgtv/painful_lessons_to_be_learned/gsucg05/,0.038,0.727,0.235,0.9632

1372,GME," I have time to spare so I’m gonna grade your “option” explanation- I’ll play the knowledgeable and the beginner so both sides views are made. 

Start: 

>An option is the right to buy 100 shares, but not a commitment to do so.

True, but this is not needed. 1) no one should ever exercises. 2) this definition just confuses beginners- it’s more confusion. Some some can learn option without understanding this as they will not be exercising. 

>2 large ""calls"" betting on the price rising:
330 at the strike price of $52, so if exercised he could have 33000 shares.
>261 at strike of $52.5, so 26100 shares if exercised.
One moderate ""put"" betting on it falling to strike $51, 6 contracts, so the option on 600 shares

Here you should really define what call, strike, and put, and exercise even mean before writing the numbers. For someone that doesn’t understand the image, they def will not understand what any of what you wrote means. And using word alike “large” should be avoided. Large option could be either the leverage or the price- which is stupid since this same “large” bet would be like 10 GME calls- not something if call “large”. 

>The cost on the far right is how much the options cost, per share, that x100 (and times the number of contracts bought) is gone, you spent it. 

The cost of the far right is the MARK price of the option CURRENTLY. Mark price is just the mid point of bid-ask spread. So it’s not exactly the value but close to it. The option he bought costs more than the price show in the right, since he had loss, so you can assume that he bought the option for more than their current price. 

>You hope to recoup it either selling the options, or exercising them if they turn ITM (In The Money)

The first is true. Second is- no retail investor does it so it’s not even an “option”. (Funny because the reason it’s called option is that you have the option to do so, but no one actually does it). You make money by selling the contract. DO NOT EXERCISE (buy shares at strike). 

>With the 52 call example the shares would have to have hit $52 + option cost for them to be profitable if exercised, but exercising means buying all those shares.

The strike+cost= break even. So the profit would come after hitting that number. Because he is leveraged 330X in 52 calls, every cent $MO gains after 52+cost, gives him 330 dollars. Every dime gives him 3,300$. And if MO hits, 53$ (currently 51.3) or gains 3% in the next 2 days, he gets 25k just from the 52c. (Every 1$ gains 33k from 52c). 

>People sell option contracts they bought to others if they cannot afford to exercise them themselves.

99.99999999% of the time this is true. 

>When you exercise, you're paying the price per share that it was when the option was bought, so the difference between that and the share value when you exercise is profit (less the option cost) if you then sell them off.

This is wrong. The price at option bought time doesn’t matter. The strike of the option is the price you agreed to buy the stock at. When you exercise, you are simply paying the strike price of the option. 


>If it doesn't hit 52 by 4/1/21 they're worthless though, your option to exercise has expired.

True. 

>I'm not good at this but it will do until someone wants to explain it better/pick holes in what I have wrong.

Here is some helpful tips; 

\-If you like the stock long term, buy option LEAPS, and give yourself time for the position 

\-""Short Squeeze"" is not the norm, run ups and excitement are... always do your due diligence on everything, make sure it makes sense

\- If you buy an option that expires within the month, try NOT to hold it for more than a day. Theta will burn you before you make any profits

1456,AAPL," You're staring with assuming another pandemic, which does not appear to be the direction for the US and that TSLA is ""overpriced"" when the market clearly has decided otherwise. I'm bearish on TSLA also, but guess what, QQQ can rotate out of it if they want to and momentum takes it that way. Rotation out of tech would cause some downward pressure for QQQ, but it's offset by growth in other areas. There's already talks of stimulus round 4, with a massive vaccination rate.

AAPL sales have already proven to be fairly pandemic resistant.

Look at AMZN's quarterly sales numbers:  
[https://www.statista.com/statistics/273963/quarterly-revenue-of-amazoncom/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273963/quarterly-revenue-of-amazoncom/)

Consistent growth, every year with massive holidays spikes, so yes people are going to buy more stuff. The same is true with MSFT and cloud/team subscriptions.  


It sounds to me like you're assuming the world is either going to a) completely stop or b) people are going to suddently stop using large cap tech products like they have literally never done before. I find it far more likely we see middle to upper-middle class people who have been able to refi and buy homes at the lowest rates in history, who have been unable to spend discretionary income on anything due to shutdown and are sitting in their houses on a shitload of cash:

Rotation out of tech would cause some downward pressure for QQQ, but it's offset by growth in other areas. There's already talks of stimulus round 4, with a massive vaccination rate.

NFLX didn't blow up over night and neither will P+ but, it's ability to do what Netflix did in its first decade is exponentially easier than it was for Netflix and will be exponentially more profitable. Paramount is one of the major motion picture studios, imagine all the infrastructure and talent pools they're able to access, high grade A list acting; not the fucking C+ budget priced, who the fuck is this type of talent Netflix splurges on! They've already announced that certain movies produced by Paramount will be available on P+ 45 days after its theatrical release; 5 years from now P+ could be a behemoth with regards to content providers. Netflix is only going to deteriorate, with more companies retaining rights to their content for their own platforms and or charge Netflix a heavy premium which will ultimately lead to the content being more difficult to access on a consistent basis.

1519,COTY," Took a flyer on COTY a couple months ago after hearing about her and have been adding to my position all along the way. I'll probably reevaluate things if the stock hits $12 or two weeks before earnings

The biggest negative is that the board kind of sucks and has a real habit of overpaying for garbage. The Kardasian lineup they bought last year is some of the cheapest products on the market. Those deals happened early on in Nabi's tenure, though, so I can't really fault her for that. I'm optimistic about their future, but sometimes a bad board can tie the hands of a good CEO. They also really don't appeal to younger women either because other brands have been much, much better about sustainability, representation, etc. That said, they brought in Nabi specifically to deal with that problem, so we'll see how it goes",OrwellWhatever,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mgpr4j/coty/gsuf0vt/,0.08,0.848,0.072,-0.3242
