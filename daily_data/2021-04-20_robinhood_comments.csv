5,AMC," hedgies that got busted in january for shorting the absolute dick off AMC and GME still haven't covered their positions and retail is holding the float tighter than a bare scrotum in the arctic until it squeezes. Meanwhile short interest and utilization rate have been slowly going up as they continue to suppress the natural price action of those two stocks while DTC and OTC regulations get implemented as a safety net for non-defaulting DTCC members, thereby costing the short sellers more by the day to maintain their positions just to keep a lid on those two stocks, because once they go it's off to the races.

All that leads to the busted hedges being forced to liquidate assets across the market to have collateral on hand, per new SEC regulation, for when the margin call comes (whether its next week or in six months). get ready to see more viacom/royal canadian bank type sell offs in the coming weeks.

7,GME," I had wanted to get into stocks for a few years, but finally had about $400 that I could safely invest and not have to worry about it. So in the start of February I think, I invested $400 across maybe...9 companies? I was briefly up about 20%, now I vacillate between my stocks being worth about $300-$320. I can admire people who stuck with GME and reaped the rewards, as well as the successes of others...but yeah I get confused and discouraged with so much glowing praise and enthusiasm, because my experience has not been that.

I’m likely to just leave everything as it is, and watch for changes 6 months, 12 months, 18 months from now. This was my first foray, and intended as a learning experience with a long-term goal, so I’m not really hurting or anything. But yeah, I feel you. It’s disappointing.

Also, I get that $400 is probably peanuts to a lot of people. It’s nothing to jeopardize my month-to-month or anything, but $400 is $400.",Iskariot-,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/muscoe/whats_been_going_on_with_the_market_for_the_past/gv7naoq/,0.074,0.706,0.22,0.9848
