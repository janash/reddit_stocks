12,DD," I can totally see what you mean. However, the companies she has bought aren’t just randomly picked out of nowhere. The research is real. Sure she gained in popularity this year by people laughing at her over her Tesla pick and having to get to close her price target way sooner than expected. What you are missing here is her view point. In the 1990s some of her companies would be valued at 100X their current bubble levels from what they can do. Some of her picks could change health care forever and no one is really thinking this way. Kathie already has a plan if there are big sell offs in her picks or ETFs she will cash out any losers and go more into her favorite picks. So ARKK you have to be ready for it to fall to $40 and be ready to take gains at $300. That is the kind of potential we are talking about here. It is hard to look into all the companies she invest in. But last year I did do a deep dive into 30 of them and wow, her DD and research are really really good. But one thing is some of these plays will take 5-10 years to really play out but when they do watch out because they will take entire billions and billions of business away from current players.

55,HUGE," >tion with those investor flows, the Ark ETFs have developed what by any industry standard represent HUGE holdings in many of the portfolio companies, as high as 25-30% in dozens of cases. Many of these holdings are illiquid companies that don't trade significant volume on any given day. The combination of low liquidity, huge investor inflows into the ETF, and now enormous ownership stakes in the portfolio companies has had the effect of driving share prices higher. Much of the ETF's performance over the last 12-14 months is not a function of fundamental improvement of the portfolio companies, but a function of the ETF having to buy illiquid equity securities when inflows are positive. This may not be readily apparent to the untrained eye, but it is crystal clear for those with access to industry flow data.

56,ANY," No, I somehow managed to survive my Master's in Data Science. What I said is that \*as a response predictor\* we would ignore an R-sq less than 90%. Why? Because a 50% R-sq means that only 29% of the natural variance of the data's standard deviation is explained. The confidence interval that he is giving us is HUGE, and by increasing to 90% we get a confidence interval that is half the size. This is why, to use in a predictor-response model like above, you should be using ADJUSTED R-sq.

Or if you are looking at two things that have a strong physics-like relation to one another. If I'm looking at fossil fuel output vs. temperature increase, I might be okay with a weak R-sq like this. But when you are trying to do a novel comparison that takes all the complexity of the market and finance and tries to collapse that into a single number...you're gonna want a LOT more accuracy than that.

OR if you wish to supplement this with the basic requirements of any regression analysis: adjusted R-sq, and outlier handling, and residuals plot. Then we may look at it and say it's fine at that level. But to throw out this R-sq without ANY of that, and pretend it means something for something this strict...no. It's meaningless.

Sure, it would get the fund out of a bad liquidity spot. However now the fund is going to be heavily skewed away from AAPL and towards the companies that just lost a lot of money.

Ultimately she will need to re-balance the portfolio. If the liquidity issue is just temporary, this won't be hard to recover from. However if there's a broad trend of the underlying companies losing value, the ""sell AAPL to create liquidity"" card will have already been played, and then the fund will be even more concentrated in companies that are vulnerable to liquidity issues.",WinterHill,8,/r/stocks/comments/lv1sjx/investors_beware_arkk_is_a_liquidity_disaster/gpb86yb/,0.117,0.796,0.087,-0.7433

73,NIO," Honestly I'm a little bit bearish on NIO and I'm gonna try to explain why:

&#x200B;

* Starting from the topic on this post: The EU market

1.1 It won't be easy for NIO to enter the EU market, no matter what country they decide to go first. Several brands over the past decades have tried and failed. Examples can go from Ssangyong, Subaru, Chevrolet, Infinity amount others. Ofcourse due to different reasons but still... not an easy market

1.2 Even if they manage to enter and hold for a while it won't be a huge success. We see several other brands almost fighting for survival. Several examples might include Mitsubishi, KIA. Few brands actually went on to have an huge success, examples such as Honda. Even after decades on the EU market, only for the last few years Hyundai is starting to have its place and grow

1.3 Imagining that NIO is able to do that it will either be fighting agaisnt the likes of Mercedes, BMW and AUDI or agaisnt Peugeot, Citroen, Volvo, VW.... It won't be easy either way

&#x200B;

* NIO in China

Even in China NIO has a fair amount of competition, coming from TESLA itself but also from companies, such as Li Auto and Xpeng. So... even in China they do not have an easy task ahead

&#x200B;

* NIO: the next TESLA

I mean.... really? There is not next TESLA because TESLA is... TESLA. It's not only about being an electric car company, is about everything that surrounds, from Elon itself to SpaceX and how everyone hears of Tesla daily because of tons of different reasons. I really don't think any brand can repeat that, and for sure not a brand coming out of China

&#x200B;

* EV's in general

Everyone is going to start making EV's! From VW to Mercedes, to Hyundai, Honda, to Seat, Ford. Guys... there is a EV Mustang! CMON! How do you expect NIO to compete with these brands? These brands offer at the very least a sense of familiarity that is more than enough for many to not even consider other new brands.

&#x200B;

* NIO still has a lot to prove

Yes, the numbers look promising but they still have a loooooooooong way to go. Even in the Chinese market! And lets not forget that NIO start was a bit complicated and the company has already been through the mud. It manage to get up and escape but... is never a good signal

&#x200B;

* Batteries as a Service

Now this is where NIO is thinking outside the box, and this is where I'm actually pretty confortable speaking on. Over the past decades we have seen the rise of Mobility as a Service, with Car Sharing services and Bike Sharing services. These types of services have become super important in Europe and they are already part of many European cities. So... NIO has the right idea: lets do the same but for batteries. Afterall, a big downside for EV's are charging times, so, if someone is able to replace within 5min the batteries of a car, provinging a ""a full tank"" perspective, well thats fucking amazing. BUT, there is always a BUT:

1. The technology to achieve that is not easy and will not come cheap
2. Infrastructure needed will be extremely expensive
3. That service requires constant planning and input changes, such as, moving batteries from one place of the city to another, according to the needs. It is not a self balancing cycle
4. Bikes work: the end consumer just spends a few € for using the service. Its not their bike. The same for cars! its not their cars. So its super accessible thanks to pricing.
5. Bikes just stay there, and so does cars... on the street. Batteries not really. And since you need the users to actually buy the cars first, the system will completly fail with a low cap. Either a large group is using the service to keep it running or... it just stops!

All of these arguments are just for the sake of conversation. They represent my opinions and little knowledge that I've aquired over the years studying and researching transport and spatial planning, including EV's. 

I'm all in favor of EV's, Batteries as a Service sounds amazing on paper but a headhache to achieve. We can easly think that NIO will be the next TESLA, that it will completly change how we look at EV's but... thats a long shot! In time, and in chance.

92,EQC," I see that you have some knowledge about Nio but they aren't deep ennough. Let me throw this at you, Nio builds good cars period, and I think whether or not they will succeed in Euro depends on the price they are going for. In China Nio is punching above its weight and sending out cars that are cheaper but better than competitors. This is due to Nio manufacturing in China and imported cars have hight tax rates. We will see if Nio can get their price low enough in Euro, I would say a ES6 / EC6 will sell wel if it goes for about the same price as EQC or E-tron. Don't quote me on prices, didn't bother reasearching EQC and E-tron's price in Norway. 

And a few things on BaaS.

1. Yes, not easy and not cheap, but Nio has already leaped over the tough part.
2. Yes, but so are super chargers. I thought battery swap stations would be a lot more expensive but apparently not. Although we have no offical numbers on the costs, but from what I've heard the dealta is surprisingly small.
3. No, it doesn't reaquire moving bateries between stations.

And you seemed to be confused about baterry swapping and BaaS. BaaS is allowing the user to buy the car but rent the battery. This allows lower point of entry into Nio's cars since you get like 60,000 RMB off immediately when purchasing the car. This is like 15% off of from the full price. You then pay like 1000 RMB a month to rent the battery. So this is BaaS in essence, there are a few more parts like supposed lower depreciation and upgrade.

Battery swapping itself really has nothing to do with BaaS, Nio has had it since like day one. BaaS only came out a few months ago. But whether or not BaaS can be done overseas is still questionable, since Nio has to get the government to approve this model as the baterry actually doesn't even belong to the car owner.",Carrera_GT,5,/r/stocks/comments/lvcqxh/chinese_nio_electric_cars_on_sale_in_europe_this/gpbsey7/,0.077,0.812,0.111,0.9491

I don't know why my age is relevant but I'm 27yo and I'm from a country in Europe.

NIO has a chance in China, I just said that don't have an easy task ahead. Tesla is already quite big in China and there are a lot of competitors, like Li Auto and Xpeng, both offering good alternatives. As you said, the market is huge and has a place for everyone but it won't be easy

Someone is trying to cash in on the GME moment by making it look like there are similar movements springing up around other stocks, to trick others via social influence, feeling like part of a movement, etc. Both stocks were ones that had sudden drops and likely left bag holders, so that might be the motivation for the pumps.

For a lot of people their brains equate group think as evidence of truth. “If the group is big enough it must be true why would all these people lie or how could all these people be wrong”

The issue is that the internet has allowed 7 billion people to come together under one “roof.” In a large enough population you will always find outliers and when 7 billion people come together those outliers become relatively large in number. 100,000 people believing in something seems like a huge number but in the grand scheme of things 100,000 is only 0.00001% of the entire human population.

There’s another problem that has become increasingly evident after the 2020 election and the GME situation: the inability to admit being wrong/defeat.

Look at the GME volume chart just before the 13th of January.

Volume was 6-10M daily.

On the 13th of January, with no immediate news (RC on the board was announced 2 days before, mind you), the volume went up to 144M.

That's a 20-fold increase in the typical daily volume of a stock that was reasonably talked about on W S B, though it wasn't really mainstream yet.

There was no coordination on reddit, everyone was taken by surprise (even DFV of course), nobody saw that coming, except a few who analysed transactions and was expecting whales sooner or later to join the party.

229,IBKR," * Financial ignorance: Northern Europe has some investing culture, in the south people are just used to lose money when they deal with stocks. They say the average Joe in America loses money in stocks, now imagine that Joe in Greece, Italy or Portugal. Stock market here just goes down lol.




* Horrible brokers: IBKR is by far the best, everything else is utter trash. Paying 50% of commission on a dividend is a common thing. Having double taxation on dividends, which is ilegal pretty much everywhere, is also common. In Portugal they call it ""imposto de selo"". You pay it on every fee the banks charges you.



* Rich people culture: this is changing a bit but it is very common to hide wealth and being ultra conservative in investments and therefore there isn't an angel investing culture. Some american funds simply started by a rich guy that hires private wealth managers and then decide that they can do well and share this cost if they allow other capital to come in (Example: Cathie Wood, ARK Invest).


* Old wealth. Some of the biggest companies never had to raise capital and then wealth gets concentrated. (Lidl, IKEA, Intermarché are good examples)


* Bureaucracy: much harder and costly here for many reasons. If I wanted to start a trust fund in Portugal I would probably require ass surgery after a few days.

* Costs and risks to raise cash. In the US a burguer shop can go public and do well. Here it simply doesn't worth it.


* Retirement funds (Portugal only, I believe): government has a monopoly on managing retirement funds. I believe this only happens here. Now it is possible to have a private retirement fund but people don't do it because they can't afford having 2 retirement funds.

249,UK," There is a surprising number of middle aged Germans who have stocks as well, but let's face it - the main strategy is buy and hold. It's not active trading, and if people want to invest a greater portion of what they have, they'll probably put it into funds that do thematic investing for them (and real estate funds). Weirdly, the LSE being what it is, I'm not aware of there being the same population of single-stock investing normal middle aged UK people, but maybe they are also quiet. 

You're not going to hear about it because people don't talk about money that much. The conversations between middle aged Germans who invest in stocks will mainly be with close friends who do the same. There is newsletters about the German stock market, written in German.

But frankly, outside of the people who invest in single stocks directly, it's going to be a pretty boring topic not worthy of many conversations unless they happen to be deeply interested in economics. 

This might change if people become less secure in their pensions though. It's mainly people who have plenty of money who invest atm, and middle aged people with not much extra income are more usefully going to top up their pension as much as possible.

291,AMZN," I don't think the 'language barrier' is the reason there are intermediaries. 

China has its capital markets closed to foreign investors in it's direct form. You can't actually own a 'share' of these Chinese companies. The China market would be a great high-growth, moderately high risk market to invest into.

Instead you are buying a share in a VIE. When you invest in BABA you are buying a share of a shell company in the Cayman Islands. That company has a contract to send the actual Alibaba in China capital for a contractual right to the company's profits in the future. It should be noted at this stage they do not issue dividend's, so this contractual promise isn't fully enacted yet.

That is the intermediary that matters, not the language barrier. Anyone can read the numbers. This shell company, or it's shareholders, doesn't own stock in Alibaba and has no voting power in Alibaba. From the country and the company, all the foreign investors get is a contractual promise that they don't want to ruin the trust of this relationship so they can continue to attract foreign investment.

Another issue is China is slowly taking away any independence Hong Kong had. Hong Kong is critical, because it has served as financial geopolitical intermediary between the free capitalist markets across the world and the semi-state controlled markets inside China. As they tighten down more, it increases risk of the state control of the financial conduits between these two types of markets.

Medium and long term there is definitely more risk in this set up for the foreign investor and the risk could come from the individual company or from country-level policy.

The other problem is the Communist Party/Xi, even if the Jack Ma relationship was normalizing, sent a clear message that they will be concerned at anymore growth that gives them more market share and there will be ongoing anti-trust concerns. They are directly nervous about the monopoly power. The problem is BABA is priced to reflect future growth, especially having no current dividend. It would be worth more if we knew they were safe to gain market share much more without attracting regulators, so I'm forced to calculate a value more on their current profits now vs. growth in profits later.

Also, KO is a bad American/domestic comparison. AMZN would be best.  KO is a value company with less room to grow, but makes a strong profit that generates dividends @ 3.43% over the long-term and they have a safer, stable position in the market for their products. There is lower uncertainty and a wider moat with future competition. With such a high dividend, that is why it prices so well, investors are getting direct returns quicker. AMZN is in similar industries and it a Growth company with no dividend where investors are placing a higher value on the company due to perceived future growth. There is more uncertainty, because we don't know how much competition might develop in the future as that market is still developing overall. Same can be said for BABA.

Still, China is a very large market with lots of room to grow. This means a great deal of potential.

My recommendation... treat this more carefully and slightly more speculatively. I keep my investment in China <1% of my total Portfolio and I try to keep that in multiple companies. Don't lose sight that these are mostly Growth companies and make sure to keep your portfolio balanced with Value companies -and- make sure you factor in a little more risk than you would with a domestic company where you have a solid ownership share. As a BABA investor myself, China just sent a message of higher risk on future growth. If there are more risks, I want more potential returns.

296,ARE," How do you factor it in? Monte Carlo analysis. Run thousands upon thousands of simulations that factor in the worst case and best case scenarios. Apply a percentage of likelihood to these scenarios. There ARE risks when in investing in Chinese owned companies that aren't inherently a part of most other mainstream investments. You factor them into whatever valuation technique you want to. Some of those worst case scenarios include the value of that company's stock being zero. To determine the likelihood of that you have to dig into the external factors impacting the stock and use your judgement to apply an appropriate % chance of that happening. Those judgements are typically made by experts in Chinese markets. I am not one of those experts so I can't tell you what the best makeup for a monte carlo simulation would be, but there is a reason institutional investors trade in securities that are based out of China.

What you are doing is investing. It's smart, it's stable, and it's a good retirement plan.

The trading that you are referring to is gambling. Plain and simple. People make bets that the stock will go up, and maybe they're educated bets, but they're bets. I do the same with NBA games: I follow the league really closely and watch a lot of games, but I still lose as many bets as I win.

Since November I've been beating the market pretty handily. Due to the following:

1: I did make a couple educated guesses at stocks that would take off back in the start of the pandemic and they paid off. Namely I went heavily into Pharma and Makeup. I've since liquidated both positions except for some of the Pharma.

2: After Ford slashed their dividend I bought it, assuming it was undervalued, and it doubled more or less overnight. I DID sell this because I do not have long term confidence in the company.

3: In January/February I made another educated guess that BP and XOM were undervalued and this appears to be getting proven correct. But I'm not as confident in this.

The real question is: What's the M&A value of the stock, because if it's worth looking at, at all, then institutional buyers look at it.  And if institutional buyers are looking at it, regardless of what they tell clients they know the true value of the stock... and there have been scandals to this effect where investment banking operations were dumping while analysts on the commercial banking side were advising clients to do the exact opposite.

For M&A analysts, the real value of a company is a triangulation of various metrics including fair/intrinsic value, working capital, industry P/E multiples, etc.  It's not any one of these in isolation but whether the methods agree on a general range.

Then, as an investor, you might apply a margin of safety... i.e. if the value of a company is X, you don't pay X but some percentage below x, e.g. 20-30% discount below x.

Let's start with ATNX. Back in September they announced that FDA is going to consider their cancer medication for priority review. This is basically improved version of existing chemo drug, it's oral version of IV drug. So in practice that means this new drug is easy to transport, store, handle and administer, it's distruptive enough for FDA to grant priority review and phase 3 results are awesome. Yet stock orice has barely moved, maybe moved a bit back in autumn but over last few weeks it dropped from $14 to $12. FDA action deadline was yesterday, so I fully expect today they will announce results of this review (and based on the fact that it is improvement of existing drug AND FDA granted priority review I expect good news). Moreover, over last few weeks they announced they are bringing few other medication into market but that might have already been priced in.

Now onto ON. They are one of very few companies that have their own silicon foundaries in the US and make their product on their own from start to the end (unlike aapl, nvda, txi, etc.), they are major provider of a lot of chips used in cars and with Biden EO on silicon I fully exoect their stock to rise to $45++",FormalWath,2,/r/stocks/comments/lurfy2/what_is_the_most_undervalued_stock_right_now_in/gpa737a/,0.012,0.905,0.083,0.9319

Well at a glance, T, F, GM, BRKA/BRKB, are all trading nearer to tangible book than their peers... but that's just the surface analysis.  That means I'd look more closely at them.

I think GM's interesting for their commitments to EV platforms by 2035, but I don't really bother to predict what they *might* do in the future; all else being equal, Ford is the more undervalued of the two.

I recently added 1000 shares of T to my portfolio, since they took a $15.5 billion charge to write down their DirecTV business.  Though they seem intent on shedding their copper PSTN, they still have enormous infrastructure in their FTTH, AT&T mobility and WarnerMedia/HBO segments... a pretty large competitive moat.  So they'll be around for a while.   And even if they're not growing tremendously, their dividend payout is 7%.  So that's kind of a win-win for me.

453,HUGE," Hello Everyone,

I've been getting more and more into the stocks these past two years and decided to become a more informed investor. Started to read 10-K reports for companies that I hold, but I had a question regarding PLTR's employee stock-based compensation.

When looking into the cost of revenue from 2019 -> 2020, there is a HUGE increase in their cost which PLTR attributes to stock compensation. We even see that PLTR operated at a loss due to these stock-based compensations (per their 10-k report), "" In the year ended December 31, 2020, we **incurred losses** from operations of **$1.2 billion**, or income from operations of $189.9 million when excluding stock-based compensation"".

I read through the 10-K report, but can't seem to find the answer. Are these employee stock compensations 1-time costs due to the listing earlier in September 2020? Or will these compensation programs continue to grow (which seems concerning since their revenue is only 1.08 billion)?

Also, what tips would you recommend reviewing when reading a 10-K report? I read an overview of the company and their products offered. Now trying to read through these tables for their contribution margin. Anywhere else I should focus on within these reports? Thanks in advance!

So I moved on, I purchased 6 shares of APHA for $24 when it blew up and then sold when it hit $15 for even more loss but here’s where I fucked up and I think you know where it’s going. I rebought into APHA 16 @16.98 so wash sale. Now I use TD and one there my cost basis is now $24 but was initially $27 because I tried to offset the cost but thinkorswim says I’m in @17 and is showing profit. Now say if I were to hypothetically sell @ $20 and I have 26 shares now. Would I still be in a loss? Do I have to hit the $24 cost basis to profit or am I already profitable?

I don't believe your statement is true but let me know if I'm misinterpreting this: Stat News reports that both Pfizer/Moderna were \~95% ""effective at \*preventing symptomatic Covid-19\* after the second dose""; to me, this is much stronger evidence than the JNJ vaccine which only showed 66% effectiveness for protection ""against moderate to severe Covid infection."" As for the comment about testing during variants, I agree that we don't know much about the effectiveness vs variants. But I think my point still stands that JNJ would be better for a less risky population vs Pfizer/Moderna should be prioritized for the high-risk ones.

10k at 5% div yield is $500 a year. That’s $41 a month. And we know one way or another inflation is going to catch up to us sooner or later.

Even with passive investment into SP funds for the next 10 years that 10k is not going to grow nearly enough to produce a dividend that would make a noticeable difference in retirement. (10k at 10% compounded over 10 years is about 25k which shakes out to about $100 a month in divs, adjusted for inflation 10 years after the greatest money printing spree in American history and well we can be dang sure it won’t buy you $100 today).

$10k seems like a lot of money when you aren’t used to having any but in terms of retirement planning at age 60 it’s less than peanuts. I’m not saying that to sound harsh I’m saying it because it’s true. That’s one major home repair. That’s 2 or 3 major vehicle repairs. Maybe 5 vacations if you vacation cheap. 

How much difference will $70-$80 per month of buying power make? Not much. How much will $700-$800 make? A significant difference. 

When we talk about taking risks it doesn’t need to be an all or nothing bet. I’m not saying play options on tesla. Tech is on fire and will be for the foreseeable future. There’s always going to be new tech coming out and getting ahead of it yields returns. SPACs are an incredibly easy way to beat the market right now and relatively low risk getting in around NAV and taking profit often.

627,IMO," Keep in mind your dad is retiring in less than 10 years, I don’t know why you didn’t include bonds. If we have a crash, your dad is gonna be up a creek and most likely unable to retire if he doesn’t have some bonds. Not to mention he might panic sell. 

I mean. I’m not a financial advisor however I think having 70% dedicated to something like SPHD or VYM is not a wise choice. I think he’s best off with just putting money into VTI, VXUS and BND. 

I’m sure you know about dividend irrelevance theory, yes? If not, receiving a dividend is the same as selling shares, it adds no extra benefit, it’s not some magic money you get, it comes out of the share price. If you don’t know this, you need to read up. You’re actually worse off receiving a dividend; you get the dividend if you need the money or not and then you have to pay taxes on it. 

As for picking and choosing sectors. I’d think that would be a waste of time and money for him. Sector specific ETFs are more expensive and more risky than Index funds. The saying is “don’t spend your time finding the needle, just buy the haystack.” 

So IMO I’d have like 5% dedicated to sectors specific funds if you’re absolutely dying to have them. While having the vast majority dedicated to VTI, VXUS and BND (95% or more in these 3 funds). I’d also not pursue any dividend ETFs and high yield stocks for the sake of dividends.

Currently NIO and two tickers who cannot be mentioned here (backwards being OGNB and MDNN) are killing me, the latter two more so than the former. I am comfortable holding NIO long-term, but I suspect I may have tried to catch falling knives and am currently bagholding the latter two. Only time will tell, as I don't want to sell until I see how they do in 2021 (unless obvious and drastic news comes out confirming them to be lost causes). 

Those are what I consider to be my 'speculative' stocks, alongside UMC and BMBL. The rest are dividend stocks, except for AAPL's and MTCH. MTCH was intended to be a hedge against BMBL (as they pretty much have the online dating market to themselves, so if one fails the other should rise, maybe?), while AAPL just something I thought would be a good buy at the current prices, especially with talks of their own EV floating around. 

I wanted to nab some Lucid Motor stocks (another ticker that cannot be named) in the 20-25 range, but it refused to dip that low so far, now back up from 28-29 to 31-32. I still think it is currently a bit overvalued, though, and thus am waiting it out. Aside from that, what else would you recommend I spend my remaining cash allocation on, preferably to diversify as I am pretty much just in tech and real estate at the moment...

775,TV," With these holdings you have to bear in mind that there is the possibility of them declining around 90%. If you are ok with it, then fine. However I would suggest that taking Peter Lynches approach at at least have one stock in at least 4 baskets:

  

* Slow Growers: Large and aging companies expected to grow only slightly faster than the     U.S. economy as a whole, but often paying large regular dividends.
* Stalwarts: Large companies that are still able to grow, with annual earnings growth     rates of around 10% to 12%; examples include Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, and     Bristol-Myers. If purchased at a good price, Lynch says he expects good but not enormous     returns--certainly no more than 50% in two years and possibly less. Lynch suggests     rotating among the companies, selling when moderate gains are reached, and repeating the     process with others that haven’t yet appreciated. These firms also offer downside     protection during recessions. 
* Fast-Growers: Small, aggressive new firms with annual earnings growth of 20% to 25% a     year. These do not have to be in fast-growing industries, and in fact Lynch prefers those     that are not. Fast-growers are among Lynch’s favorites, and he says that an     investor’s biggest gains will come from this type of stock. However, they also carry     considerable risk. 
* Cyclicals: Companies in which sales and profits tend to rise and fall in somewhat     predictable patterns based on the economic cycle; examples include companies in the auto     industry, airlines and steel. Lynch warns that these firms can be mistaken for stalwarts     by inexperienced investors, but share prices of cyclicals can drop dramatically during     hard times. Thus, timing is crucial when investing in these firms, and Lynch says that     investors must learn to detect the early signs that business is starting to turn down. 
* Turnarounds: Companies that have been battered down or depressed--Lynch calls these ""no-growers"";     his examples include Chrysler, Penn Central and General Public Utilities (owner of Three     Mile Island). The stocks of successful turnarounds can move back up quickly, and Lynch     points out that of all the categories, these upturns are least related to the general     market.
* Asset opportunities: Companies that have assets that Wall Street analysts and others     have overlooked. Lynch points to several general areas where asset plays can often be     found--metals and oil, newspapers and TV stations, and patented drugs. However, finding     these hidden assets requires a real working knowledge of the company that owns the assets,     and Lynch points out that within this category, the ""local"" edge--your own     knowledge and experience--can be used to greatest advantage.",RoPrime12,3,/r/stocks/comments/lv5dlb/rate_my_portfolio_rstocks_quarterly_thread_march/gpaomz8/,0.036,0.808,0.156,0.9955

I bought this stock Monday for $10, but then I sold it on Tuesday for $5.
I get $5 in my acct but I lost the other $5. I want my five dollars back!
On Wednesday, the same stock drops to $1 and I want back in. I buy one share for $1. My new share now has a $6 break even price bc it holds the “potential” value of the $5 I want back, even though I only spent $1 for it on Wednesday. 
On Thursday the stock goes to $2.
I can sell it and make money on my $1 investment, but I’m still down $4 from the $5 I want back. 
If I sell it for $2, I’ll get the $2, but I’ll still be in the hole.
If I sell it for $4, I’ll get $4, but I’ll still be in the hole $2.
If I sell it for $6, ill get $6 returned to my account AND I’ll have broken even from losing $5 and my new $1 investment. 
Now I have reset my share prices, retrieved all of my losses and all that money is back in my account. 
You don’t get the money from the loss back until you make up for it in profits from the stocks new wash price.

Now, let’s say I buy a stock for $1000 and it goes to $500. I sell for a $500 loss.
I buy it again for $100, now making it $600. But it keeps going down and I sell it again for $50! Shit!
I decide I’m never buying this stock again!
I now have an ALLOWED loss of $50 and a disallowed loss of $500.
This comes into the situation of tax time. Let’s say the rest of the year, you make zero dollars trading anything. All you do is lose. Fuck. You lose $2000 the rest of the year + that one wash sale of $500 ultimately equaling $2500 in losses. Well the IRS let’s your deduct up to $3000 in losses each year. You only get to deduct $2000 because the other  $500 is not allowed (disallowed). Boo hoo! You don’t have to pay taxes on the $500 you lost, but you don’t get to claim it as a loss, lowering your tax bill either. 

Also, let’s say you make $100,000 profits this year. Awesome!! But you also have $75,000 in disallowed losses. Oh shit. NOW you are going to pay taxes on $100,000 instead of just $25,000 bc the disallowed losses don’t deduct off of your gains like normal losses. So you will be paying taxes on WAY more money than you actually made.
And that SUCKS.
I always tell myself that if I’m going back in knowing it will result in a wash sale, i am committed to make my losses back. The best way to do this is to make sure you buy back in for LOWER than you sold, resulting in your new shares AT LEAST being lower than what your original price was. If you buy in at a higher price than you sold, then your new shares are now higher than the first time you bought them. And that sucks.

You lose $2000 the rest of the year + that one wash sale of $500 ultimately equaling $2500 in losses. Well the IRS let’s your deduct up to $3000 in losses each year. You only get to deduct $2000 because the other  $500 is not allowed (disallowed). Boo hoo! You don’t have to pay taxes on the $500 you lost, but you don’t get to claim it as a loss, lowering your tax bill either. 

Also, let’s say you make $100,000 profits this year. Awesome!! But you also have $75,000 in disallowed losses. Oh shit. NOW you are going to pay taxes on $100,000 instead of just $25,000 bc the disallowed losses don’t deduct off of your gains like normal losses. So you will be paying taxes on WAY more money than you actually made.
And that SUCKS.
I always tell myself that if I’m going back in knowing it will result in a wash sale, i am committed to make my losses back. The best way to do this is to make sure you buy back in for LOWER than you sold, resulting in your new shares AT LEAST being lower than what your original price was. If you buy in at a higher price than you sold, then your new shares are now higher than the first time you bought them. And that sucks.

883,TSLA," I like to think of a wash sale as a bill that I owe myself. 
I bought this stock Monday for $10, but then I sold it on Tuesday for $5.
I get $5 in my acct but I lost the other $5. I want my five dollars back!
On Wednesday, the same stock drops to $1 and I want back in. I buy one share for $1. My new share now has a $6 break even price bc it holds the “potential” value of the $5 I want back, even though I only spent $1 for it on Wednesday. 
On Thursday the stock goes to $2.
I can sell it and make money on my $1 investment, but I’m still down $4 from the $5 I want back. 
If I sell it for $2, I’ll get the $2, but I’ll still be in the hole.
If I sell it for $4, I’ll get $4, but I’ll still be in the hole $2.
If I sell it for $6, ill get $6 returned to my account AND I’ll have broken even from losing $5 and my new $1 investment. 
Now I have reset my share prices, retrieved all of my losses and all that money is back in my account. 
You don’t get the money from the loss back until you make up for it in profits from the stocks new wash price.

Now, let’s say I buy a stock for $1000 and it goes to $500. I sell for a $500 loss.
I buy it again for $100, now making it $600. But it keeps going down and I sell it again for $50! Shit!
I decide I’m never buying this stock again!

887,GME," it is for tax purposes.

it's basically to prevent people from offsetting their gains at the end of the year.

Example your total taxable income (including investments) for 2020 is $86,000. That puts you in the 24% federal tax brackets.

And it's december 2020.. you're thinking you know what I'm gonna sell GME at a loss for $2,000.That makes your income $84,000. which puts you in the 22% bracket.

GME drops further in January and you rebuy it. IRS catches this and say you just sold it at a loss less than 30 days ago. so the loss from your december sale is now added to your January purchase. You no longer able to use your $2000 loss to offset your 2020 tax but you can use it in 2021 assuming you'll sell it a loss in the future. so your taxable income for 2020 remains $86000 because you repurchase it within 30 days. if you wait til february (or more than 30 days after you sold your GME), you could have used your $2000 loss to offset your 2020 gains

890,GME," Basically yes. They just move the number to your second purchase. But you're losing more money and the loss from first transaction is still there.

X. scenario 1

* You buy 1 share at 150
* You sell at 100. your loss is 50. 
* if this is the end of your GME for the next 30 days. Your $50 loss is still under your ""realized gains/lossses"" balance

X.  scenario 2

* later that week. you rebuy GME at $50. 
* The cost basis now is $100 even though you only paid for $50. 
* The loss from previous transaction will no longer show under your realized gains/losses balance. It will says ""disallowed loss"". 
*  so now your second GME cost basis is $100. If you close this second transaction at $50. It means you lose $50. the same $50 from first transaction.

Wash sale basically just moves numbers around and changes when you can use your loss when you repurchase same security within 30 days after selling at a loss. 

As I said previously. If you do both scenarios in the same tax year, nothing changes. Your loss is still your loss.

01/04 you buy 1 GME at $120

892,AAPL," The answer to everything you posted is basically YES. 

Hell, if you have the cash to buy the stock in the first place, you shouldn't even buy it outright. Instead, sell a cash secured Put so you get some premium off that too. For example, take Apple last week. if you had say, 12100 dollars, you sell a Put for Apple at 121. You get a nice premium, get assigned so you get the 100 shares. Now you have 100 AAPL bought at 121-premium. You then turn around and sell a Call for 125 or so. If you get assigned you already have the shares, made 400 on them and pocketed the 2 premiums. Now you have 12500 + premiums(2). And you sell another Put.

American's bread and butter is business passengers. They do their best when the economy is roaring and businesses are flying guys every which way to do bullshit kaizen events. So the uncertainty as to when they'll get back to that point I think is why there's still a potential to speculate, in either direction.

1. Poor people are locked out of investing because you need extra money to invest. You finally invest it on the advice of all your friends and peers, and it TANKS.

2. Poor people have shorter lifespans due to poor health, dangerous living conditions, and higher stress. They work physical labor jobs you would never touch, the ones that wreck your joints and back and leave you with a limp from injuries too expensive for them to treat.

3. Poor people are much more likely to be the victim of theft, especially wage theft. You already work for peanuts and then your boss moves some numbers around and delete some hours from your paycheck to make up for asset shrink or to pad their own pockets. It's ""your responsibility"" to catch and bring up this discrepancy with your boss - putting you at risk of losing your only source of income.

Put these 3 factors together. ""Your money will grow %150 in 10-20 years"" doesn't have the same ring when that means the $400 that they need NOW for food and rent is just going to turn into $1000 in two decades, by which time they may be dead for all they know.

My biggest issue with the whole DCF process is it starts with the assumption of a heightened period of growth and requires you to quantify the growth to a sustainable termination point 5 or 10 years out. I understand the practical applications, especially if it's being done from within a company to which you have ample access to resources and insider information, but as an investor trying to evaluate a company from the outside, I always feel like I'm just aimlessly spitballing when I attach a percentage growth to a firm's future cash flows. 

I'm curious how you approach the process.",Boomtown626,1,/r/stocks/comments/lurveq/mdc_looking_at_buying_more/gp8xoaa/,0.0,0.847,0.153,0.9455
974,FCF," So right now I'm playing around with the method explained on the New Money youtube channel: https://youtu.be/l-T-Vyk2txc

I'm not sure this is truly a correct/accurate calculation quite yet, but it does have an advantage of simplicity.  Where I am questioning it is the terminal value calculation.  He simply uses the final year out x10.  

I'm still looking into it, however, I am going out 10 years.  I believe this gives a fair chance of balancing out extreme fluctuations.

So, my method at the moment on determining the FCF growth rate is to calculate the 10yr, 7yr, and 3yr CAGR.  I'm waffling between taking the 10yr and taking an average.  I haven't played with it enough to have found my level of comfort with either.  My discount rate from there is 15%, which is the minimum rate of return I want to generate.

As to the aimless spitballing, I completely agree!  This is where margin of safety comes in to it.  Per Graham/Buffett/Towne, I cut my calculated value by 50%.  This factors in ""Oh god! Oh god! My growth rates were so wrong!""",Yo_Biff,1,/r/stocks/comments/lurveq/mdc_looking_at_buying_more/gp9a6b8/,0.04,0.751,0.209,0.9868

988,USA," Determine your risk tolerance and desired return. If you’re looking for meme stock gains but don’t want the risk, you’re probably not going to find it.

You can make your own allocation based on mutual funds, ETFs, CDs, bonds, stocks, and other investment vehicles. Try to hold any position for over a year to have it count as long term capital gains when you sell and not short term (if in the USA and want to pay less taxes). 

To start, you may want a slightly riskier portfolio with more in stocks and then switch it to more secure income sources as you come up on your purchase date. The target date funds are geared more for retirements, so that may not be the allocation you want. 

Diversify your holdings so you’ll eliminate nonsystemic market shocks. Find a mix of industries and compare to the S&P 500 (or other desired benchmark) and see if you have good reasons for changing the weighting of different industries in your portfolio.

Good luck with your future home purchase!

HL is an established and reliable broker and if you're maxing out your ISA with them you might want to pay for that peace of mind. The 12 pound fee lends itself to minimising your transaction numbers so if you're a buy 1000s of pounds of ETFS and hold kind of person then its immaterial.

Free options like T212 - new on the market and do you feel comfortable entrusting them with your money? (I do to a certain level). The free trades mean you can make more transactions at less of an impact. If you're a day trader or want to invest 100 pounds a month then this option is likely better",un_francais,4,/r/stocks/comments/lv5fcd/hargreaves_lansdown_your_thoughts_and_is_it_fit/gpakcfd/,0.029,0.794,0.178,0.9565
