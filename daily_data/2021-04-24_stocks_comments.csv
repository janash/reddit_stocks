The point of insuring it is me intending it to be a confidence boost so that she knows she can take some risk while still learning about stocks and not have one early mistake define her. I've worked to minimize that risk by asking her to invest X% in companies that I gave her a list of with the DD of why. I feel confident in the list I gave her and it'll teach her life long financial lessons which are worth way more than what I gave her initially.

On a more personal note, I have escaped post-secondary poverty. I have had to deal with predatory student loans/sky rocketing education cost like many of my friends, but even when I graduated May 2020 I was able to come out on top and now I'm doing very well for myself.

Heck sometimes i talk about stocks i never bought myself or have nothing to do with myself.

This is Rocket's ad. Notice at the end the actor is pointing to the phone with rocket being advertised?

Now this is UWMC's ad:

 [Big Game Spot | FindAMortgageBroker.com - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1xBt7Nch7Y) 

Notice something unusual? UWM isn't directly advertising themselves. They're advertising [FindAMortgageBroker.com](https://FindAMortgageBroker.com). 

Everybody wants to cut the mortgage broker out but UWM. Although Rocket is making the better business decision, going direct to the consumer, UWM is essentially get an entire retail arm commission only. Not only does it show extremely good moral but when the refi boom is over I personally thing Rocket is going to get a lot less market share than UWM.

Any mortgage broker with a brain should be realizing based on the two advertisements that UWM is the only person NOT trying to cut them out.

Additionally UWM's tech is much more to brag about based on interviews with brokers/ customers I've done. Lower rates. Much, much faster times.

RKT also has a very, very concerning statement deep in one of their filings. It's 751 pages and I'm not going to go look for it again. Essentially what it's saying is RKT does NOT want investors to devalue their tax assets, meaning losses they've carried over the years to reduce tax burden, and instead of paying taxes they're basically going to pay the CEO millions and/or billions per year in lieu of taxes. This is going to be a drag on their earnings for years.

UWM has a similar statement but it's not quite is much when talked about relative to the earnings.

I'm a UWMC bull and have been recommending it for months, see below, but your numbers are wrong. 76% of their Q4 business in 2020 was refinance. [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/li2yau/uwmc\_seems\_extremely\_undervalued\_to\_me/gn0zzvw/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/li2yau/uwmc_seems_extremely_undervalued_to_me/gn0zzvw/?context=3)

* UWM’s  purchase volume for 4Q2020 increased to $12.1 billion, as compared to  $11.6 billion in 4Q19. For FY20, purchase volume decreased to $42.9 billion, as compared to  $49.8 billion in total purchase volume in FY19, primarily due to a  strategic reduction in the jumbo and government purchase business.
* UWM  originated $42.6 billion in refinance volume during 4Q20, as compared  to $20.3 billion in 4Q19. UWM originated $139.6 billion in refinance volume in FY20 and $57.9 billion  in FY19. **UWM’s 2020 production mix was comprised of 76% refinance and 24% purchase.**
* UWM’s primary focus is originating conventional loans. In 2020, conventional loans represented 84% of total production.

3% margin on all loans (54billion worth for Q4 2020)

>“Closed loan volume” and “Total gain margin” are key operational metrics  that UWM management uses to evaluate the performance of the business. “Closed loan volume” is the aggregate principal of the  residential mortgage loans originated by UWM during a period. “Total  gain margin” represents total loan production income divided by total production.

giving them 1.37b for Q4 profit - which they reported in the 8k [here](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/119312521027468?cik=1783398).

You can see the breakdown of that 54 billion below. 3/4 is refinance.

Of the purchase loans they do, conventional loans are their leading area and the area they'd like to target and grow in. They are a good company and have a lot of good shit going for them, they originate fastest in the market, they're not giving out shitty loans (their average client has a 758 credit score and a 36% DTI) and the wholesale channel is growing and their chunk of that channel is also growing. UWMC is a broker dealer, and deals primarily with the loan officers and lending companies directly. That share of the market sphere (broker dealers) peaked in 2008 and has subsequently fell and leveled off in 2014 at 14%. Its currently been rising for the last 7 years at a rate of 1-2% per year. **Broker dealers like UWMC dealt with roughly 20% of the mortgage market in 2019 and will capture an estimated 21% in 2020 and return to the peak 33% by an estimated 2026.** Their refinance volume obviously will shrink as it doubled with the low rates, but they should continue to capture more of the original home loans as broker dealers continue to regain market sphere, plus they are now looking to target jumbo loans adding more original loans to their books.

Now they do note that with increasing rates their purchase volume [did go up](https://content.bamsec.com/0001564590-21-014601/gz10gtccfgdk000008.jpg) and that they are and do want to focus on origination of purchase loans, but that doesn't mean that a lot of their growth wasn't [from refinance in the last year](https://content.bamsec.com/0001193125-20-296072/g72619ex99_1p38g1.jpg).

>We  seek to have a balanced loan origination business model, with relatively higher purchase over refinancing mix which we believe has demonstrated the ability to deliver strong, stable and consistent growth  in mortgage loan origination volume and profitability through both high  and low interest rate cycles.  Our model is focused on the origination business, with a specific focus on purchase loans; this area of the  market has grown consistently over the last several years and, we  believe, is more durable with respect to interest rate fluctuations than  the refinance market. Historically, residential purchase mortgage loan  origination volume has experienced less volatility in response to  interest rate movements than the refinancing mortgage loan origination  volume. Consequently, we believe that by focusing on the purchase  business we will be better positioned to deliver consistent growth in  increasing and decreasing rate environments. In rising interest rate  environments, we believe that our demonstrated reputation for excellent  client service and short loan closing times will drive continued  purchase mortgage volume, our broad client base will allow us to  capitalize on lead generation and our cost structure will allow us to be  more competitive on margins.

I've been buying a bunch sub 7.99 but I'm only somewhat bullish and turning more neutral towards them. Their margins are good compared to the competition and they do make a lot of money from origination, but the industry is cyclical, and while I'm thinking the market remains hot for at least 1 more full year, I don't know how far I see it growing beyond that. I'm happy to buy at these prices and have a slow melt upwards, but this isn't something I think reddit has the patience for.

70,AMZN," In terms of value, I’d consider AMZN a great buy. The P/E has stayed within its long term range so it hasn’t bubbled like so many other stocks. Furthermore, it’s traded sideways for quite a while and will likely take a big leap in the not-too-distant future.

When the stock hits 4000 or 4500, questions of whether 3300 is expensive will be painful to reflect on.

Furthermore, the company has so much potential to grow. They’re in cloud, they’re in streaming. What’s next - Amazon banking? Amazon mortgages? I see London has an Amazon supermarket now - I personally believe they’ll be the largest company in the world in the next few years.

77,AMZN," For me it's not about the share price but the market cap and price vs future earnings. AMZN has been putting up record numbers during the last year. And that's awesome. But I think that their ""traditional"" business model won't keep expanding at the rate they are, I think that their sales will increase, but not enough to move their enormous market cap. I also think that this past years performance is already priced into the shares, which is why they've been trading roughly between $3000-3400 since July. 

I think that AWS is going to be the key driver for any future revenue and FCF, and share price, growth.  The problem is the competition is fierce in that sector and there are a number of other companies that AWS has to complete with. They don't have a very good moat like they do with online retail. They tried breaking into the telemedicine industry and bailed on that. If this earnings report coming up shows AWS increasing in terms of revenue, clients, etc then I think the price will start to climb again.

i was expecting it to  drop to like $50/share post-split. it dropped to that and then way more. got greedy when i saw those insanely high 1-2 week covered call premiums and yeah, didn't turn out so great in the short term. (like i said, i'm still bullish on the company and think long term i'll end up way ahead)

outside of that, SFT would probably be my riskiest just on the premise that it's still small and localized and if it can be a big gainer will be dependent  on if they can scale their model nationally. if they can sell as well nationally as they do in california though, there's a TON of upside.",reaper527,1,/r/stocks/comments/mx6wce/riskiest_stocks_you_are_in/gvnjma7/,0.046,0.857,0.097,0.8427

Potential upcoming contracts with LAPD that has the product on a trial phase. Other police units like the NYPD will follow suite creating a domino effect with increased public pressure. 

Other reasons:

Company president is the founder of Taser, the biggest non- lethal police defense product ever created. 

Politicians such as Andre Yang are advocating for it.

Aside from that, I really try to avoid insane risks. Right when the hype was about to get really strong, I hopped into that G stock around $16 or $19, sold half at 60, sold more at $200, the rest a little lower.

It's great that you averaged down and you're now at breakeven but that strategy itself is risky. For example, if you bought Cisco in 2000 @ $70 and we're down 30%, averaged down to $50 it still had another 80% to fall and would have taken 20 years for you to claw back to breakeven.

Belief can get you into a stock but your own investing rules and risk tolerance should govern how you allocate funds to it.

There are a lot of headwinds, generally. 1) China's economy is booming so hard right now that fiscal tightening is on the horizon (impacts growth stocks/tech stocks first just like in the USA). 2) China stocks getting delisted but I am not concerned about this. We have 3 years from when the bill was passed end of last year AND our economies are so intertwined it is dramatically unlikely. 3) Sure growth could slow down but I am bullish on the industry. It is expanding too into south america with Nimo etc. 4) Regulation pressures and uncertainty surrounding Tencent and Tencent is a primary stake holding in HUYA. 5) etc.. There are always a lot of headwinds. Valid to say that they should be mentioned but I am focusing on what I see as problematic.

I, unfortunately sold all my enbridge in March like a fool. But I kept a small position in exxon and I have bought more recently because I started keeping up with the oil prices more.

Exxon is great value and aren't going to dilute their value by investing their limited capitol in speculative, competitive green energy. I think their carbon capture plan will grow in the next few years/decade. The stock is purely unloved because they realize that gas and oil isn't going anywhere anytime soon, and they're sticking to their guns. And wall street is crazy on green energy right now. 

On that note, I also do like chevron because of their deal with toyota and providing infrastructure and clean hydrogen for batteries. I think that is a step in the right direction.

257,UK," The best class to hold depends on your status as a taxpayer (i.e. where you are tax resident) and perhaps also on your currency for trading at your broker. This is not financial or tax advice, this is just my own understanding. I would guess for many people the RDS B shares on the London stock exchange are a good choice.

For certain companies able to arbitrage tax credits and for Dutch taxpayers I believe the A shares are best.

For most people around the world , B shares traded on the LSE has the least chance of incurring withholding tax since the UK has no dividend withholding tax. Though there might then be foreign exchange costs. If you trade on the LSE (and possibly other exchanges) I think you may have to pay UK stamp duty of 0.5% on the trade. 

For US holders, the B ADRs would seem a good bet. No foreign exchange costs and no extra tax. However for a non-US citizen the US ADRs are a bad choice; even with a W8-BEN the tax rate is 15% probably. Unless you are holding in a recognised pension wrapper such as a UK sipp in which case the W8-BEN will let you receive dividends from US ADRs without 15% withholding tax. You might also need to pay that 0.5% even on the ADRs. I'm not sure. I know you have to pay French dealing tax on Total even if you trade the ADRs. 

Long story short: B shares, in your local currency / nearest exchange. 

I think they trade on some euro exchanges too (Germany?) in euros and that might be handy for EU investors. 

UK companies don't withhold any dividend taxes that I know of. 

However if you hold the ADR version (the US listing) of any European or UK company and if you are holding it outside the USA, there's a US withholding tax depending on W8-BEN and depending on tax treaties between your home country and the USA.",bananacakesjoy,1,/r/stocks/comments/mx5zwb/xle_as_a_potential_oil_play/gvqwyr5/,0.053,0.865,0.082,0.9118

That's an extremely fine line you're trying to make seem different.

BH was eventually forced into buying shares of companies because it basically ran out of companies that met the strict valuation metrics that Buffett/et. al. demand when acquiring companies.

And the advice is- stay away from Poland. Biggest companies (but CD Project) in the main indice (WIG 20) are state controlled and the state as for now is controlled by the people that should not be there. The managements are not very competent to say the least - chosen from political allies and acting on behalf of government and their propaganda. They will pay out huge dividends even if it’s gonna hurt the company in the long run but the dividend will make state budget look better so they can finance buying more votes with social spending, they will do business only with political friends (or simply own families) etc. Just as example Orlen-  the biggest oil firm in the country recently bought over a 100 of polish small newspapers from German publisher. Losing business, business they never had anything to do with and the price you could expect when the seller knows the buyer is forced to buy. The company is not doing great over the last two years because of incompetent management yet they do such a move and they’re happy and claim big success for polish nation in freeing the press from German occupants ;) The very next day they start exchanging the editors to make sure all that is left in circulation is government agenda. You wouldn’t like to be invested in such circus. It is such a swamp you are not going to be able to navigate it without being immersed in Polish politics and daily press - impossible if you don’t read Polish easily. Even being Polish I still don’t want to touch it, so random and manipulated it is. 
I don’t know about Czech Republic but Hungary for sure is the same as Poland since it is ruled in very similar pattern...

You should take cyclicality of the business into account. P/E ratio is just based on most recent earnings and is really a snapshot. You should look at their financial results over a longer period of time, especially for hit-driven business with long development cycle like CD Projekt Red. CD Projekt Red's video games have a long development cycle and the sales of their games are very frontloaded. The current PE of 16 included the launch of Cyberpunk 2077. Their earnings in the following years will not nearly be as good as last year, so the company isn't as attractively valued as it seems imho.

But that's based on their most recent FY result which included the launch of Cyberpunk 2077.

Some folks will be working on those online games and I think recall there were only 50 on the phone apps. So lets say maybe, 200 folks here (probably not but lets just say that).

So in summary, there are about 500 workers unaccounted for... Thats twice as many as they had on W3 and they have been missing for a long time ;-)

I think they have been working on something for about 2 years now and I would be shocked if we didnt have a big game release next year.

Key differences being home office deductions and MTM election however you must qualify as a trader in the eyes of the IRS. See this: https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc429

You probably need to be trading 300+ days a year, multiple trades a day, and the holding period for securities is short. This can be a tough hurdle for some who are casually getting into when used to just being an investor.

353,CPA," https://www.thetaxadviser.com/issues/2010/feb/sec475mark-to-marketelection.html

Scroll down and read the **Traders making Sec. 475 election:** section. 


MTM means you get to ignore testing for wash sales, straddles, or constructive sales and everything is treated as ordinary income gains/loss. There is no capital loss limit like there is for an individual. 

Every security holding value is marked up or down to the market value at the end of the year and gains/losses are realized as if there was a constructive sale. So that $10 share you bought that is now worth $100, you owe $90 in short-term cap gain tax at end of December and it is marked up to $100 market value on your books. Your cost basis is now $100 with $0 unrealized gain/loss. 

That link above should explain the concept as well as the pro/cons of it but if you still struggle then it would be good to consult a CPA before you seriously consider trading as a business.",cityoflostwages,1,/r/stocks/comments/mx8sf8/any_benefits_to_traders_tax_status/gvn1ffi/,0.059,0.826,0.115,0.7455
354,IRS," That is correct. However the same also applies to any stocks you have a gain on.

Stock A: Bought for $50, now worth $100 at 12/31.     
Stock B: Bought for $100, now worth $25 at 12/31.    

At end of year, you do not sell either. But due to MTM, there is a ""constructive sale"" meaning you must treat it like a sale even when a sale didn't happen. They both get marked-to-market, adjusted to market value on your business balance sheet.

Stock A: $100  <-- new cost basis  
Stock B: $25  <-- new cost basis     

**Balance sheet asset account:**     
Held-for-trading Securities  $125    

As a result you recognize a gain of $50 and loss of $75, which nets to a operating loss of -$25 for your net income. No tax is owed and you now have a NOL to carryforward and apply to profit in future years. 


As an investor, not being able to control when you realize your gains to have optimal tax treatment can be pretty scary. Not every trader will opt for MTM election. It is also pretty challenging to even meet the status of ""trader"" versus investor in the eyes of the IRS. Usually it is only really high volume trading hedge funds or quant traders that manage to do it given the <30 day holding period and 1-2+ minimum traders per day.

You also of course tally up whatever gain/loss you have from sales earlier in the year and that nets into the gain/loss at 12/31 from the constructive sale when doing MTM adjustment. Everything is taxed at ordinary rate so no long-term capital rate benefit.",cityoflostwages,1,/r/stocks/comments/mx8sf8/any_benefits_to_traders_tax_status/gvn2hom/,0.055,0.782,0.163,0.9856
