0,ATH," Damn, this is a good post. Thanks for the analysis.

How do general market conditions correlate between the two time periods, and does that make a difference? It looks like the SPY started declining in Sept '16, before finding bottom mid-November before running to new all-time highs. SPY just set a new ATH Friday. 

I have started to shorten my window for swing trades, opting to keep a lot of ammo on the sidelines for any coming correction. I think we'll see a small dip this week, at least into Wednesday, depending on FAANG earnings (Netflix already reported and missed) and FOMC results.",Itsboomhomie,8,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/or2rqx/warning_signs_for_microcaps_from_the_past_via_xbi/h6flejf/,0.026,0.893,0.081,0.6808
1,AAIC," Same I’m in several low MC biotechs mostly shares. 

AAIC will be a nice catalyst for all biotech. I expect several companies to present really good data. 
With BIIB aducanumab treatment costing $56k/yr, they can charge this as they are the only AD treatment to market. 
Other companies will aim to undercut BIIB with actual cognitive improvement data.

Also the covid delta and lambda spike will encourage investors back into XBI",Peterawrrr,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/or2rqx/warning_signs_for_microcaps_from_the_past_via_xbi/h6g3qzc/,0.026,0.792,0.182,0.908

4,AAIC," Im surprised XBI is mentioned here hahaha

But I do appreciate the post and analysis as Im looking to enter a position in XBI.

AAIC is this coming week and I think there will be some good data that will make it move.

BIIB FDA approval awhile back moved XBI very nicely.",Peterawrrr,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/or2rqx/warning_signs_for_microcaps_from_the_past_via_xbi/h6fzeeq/,0.0,0.687,0.313,0.9617

6,INPX," Ha, it is a funny correlation. Of course a lot of penny stocks are biotechs, and XBI includes some. But just plot the index against charts of INPX, TBLT and YVR (none are biotechs,) you'll see what I mean. I've never considered longing XBI because I'm already so exposed to biotechs. But I would consider shorting it as a hedge instead of risking the volatility of individual stocks.

I'll look into the catalysts you mentioned, thanks! That's an angle I'm not as well versed in.",stompingllama,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/or2rqx/warning_signs_for_microcaps_from_the_past_via_xbi/h6g1f6j/,0.082,0.819,0.1,0.1581

9,PLX," One factor that could be temporarily holding things back, is FDA delays for foreign companies due to travel restrictions hindering inspections. PLX for example: https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=18324396

So maybe there could be an acceleration of approvals with easing of travel restrictions.",stompingllama,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/or2rqx/warning_signs_for_microcaps_from_the_past_via_xbi/h6g1uk0/,0.0,0.95,0.05,0.25
