37,BB," I just want to say one thing that hopefully helps everyone. I am long term Investor in Blackberry and I bought my first share seven years ago just after CEO John Chen took over. 

Listen: Today's share price is irrelevant, unimportant and it's just a number. As long as in 2023 the future value of BB shares is higher than what it is today. That's what matters, this is important. 

Blackberry has come a long way. It's making progress tremendous progress and more recently transitioned itself from hardware to software and from smart phone icon to smart car icon. 

Patent settlement is complete,  they interef into a definitive agreement which means it's done deal. This is one big reason you should not worry about anything especially the share price of today. 

When asked about patent sale. John Chen said stay tuned. He meant hold, don't sell your shares, good news is coming. 

Blackberry removed the curtains recently in Q1 FY2022 and the truth came out. They beat  revenue estimates by 3,000,000 and narrowed losses significantly from 1.14 to .11 per share YoY.  In addition, Blackberry went on a hiring spree and stepped up sales hiring and plan to increase foot on the street by 23% in this quarter. 

Blackberry is launching AWS IVY Intelligent Car Platform. They recently formed IVY Advisory Council and GEICO AWS TELUS HERE CERENCE

So I decided who the fuck cares. If I'm 69 or 70 or 80 and can't afford to live I can just fucking die. Better then working slaving away doing bullshit I hate just so I can be comfortable and extend my life runway more when I'm old and decrepit.

So 2016 I thru hiked the AT. 2018 rode a bicycle from mexico to canada and hiked the CDT through Montana Wyoming and Colorado. 

2019 and 2020 I lived in a van and worked as a wildland firefighter.

Got lucky with some business ventures this year and now have enough saved to comfortably travel for a decade.

And that's what I'm gonna do. Hike the PCT starting July. Maybe hike it and or the CDT again next year. From there goto south america or SE Asia.

Without having to maintain a house car etc it's a really cheap way to live. 15k a year is a roomy budget. Way better then paying 30k+ a year just to maintain a shitty existence so you have the privilege of working and making someone else rich.

And if I run out of money in a decade I'll figure out how to make more. 

I don't see this as a risk at all. My family says save this money and work another 10-20 years THEN retire.

Fuck that. The bigger gamble is wasting life away on frivolous bullshit and putting off what you really want. Tomorrow is not guaranteed.

We absolutely are not, the reluctance for many Americans to adopt the Vaccine has caused several mutation variants that spread faster than the previous, currently the Delta variant is beginning to spread rapidly in the USA.

145,DD," I love Dave and Busters, drinks, arcades and pool tables‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ but $Play is looking like a pump and dump right now, there have been posts warning people about this, people with many wrinkles in their brains trying to bring up a stock in Reddit and Twitter just to dump it by mid day Monday‚Ä¶.. OP sounds like and article trying to sell you ‚Äúprime relataste‚Äù in the middle of the desert..

Here are the reasons why I believe it‚Äôs a pump and dump..

1) It‚Äôs been trading around $40-$65 for the last 5 years

2) Its was at $42 (the highest in the last year) on Thursday and went down to $40 by today

3) The best time for $Play was from Mar 20, 2020 when the stonk was at $7.76 to October 2, 2020 when it was around $15.70 or so, you started to see green crayons up consistently after that reaching a peak around March 2021 around $49 then it‚Äôs been on the down consistently from there

4) If you do want to make a play on $Play, the trend seams to go about like this‚Ä¶. Hits higher peak on beginning of June (Summer vacations starts), then you see red crayons for the next 2 months‚Ä¶. Then endings of August and beginning of September you see a huge spike (I am guessing Summer Vacation almost over so people try to get as much playtime as possible)

148,IMO," I consider myself absolutely balls deep in D&B having gone there consistently over the last few years. I will say 2020 was definitely a shock to their system but looking at the 5 year charts $40 seems to be the usual bottom-support the stock would bounce off of. 
From a consumer standpoint, I will say their BOGO sales are noticeably less frequent, though their marketing is doing well to generate attention - they‚Äôre investing in new games and attractions, and with the return of sports on TV means people will have a reason to go their for the food and drink and sit and watch games. Their Half-Off Wednesdays still blow the doors off every location I‚Äôve been to, and as long as people want to dump their kids off to avoid parenting them, D&B will continue to generate business. I‚Äôve also noticed people packing out the restaurants in multiple locations more often than I did pre-rona. Seems people are very excited to be back as our wives‚Äô boyfriends need somewhere to go and have a good time playing games while we‚Äôre at home monopolizing the Nintendo switch they bought us.
Tldr
$40 is a decent entry point IMO if planning to go long, however in WSB fashion I don‚Äôt have a price target or a known catalyst apart from earnings for any quick options plays, but I‚Äôm bullish. I‚Äôm tied up in other plays so no positions in $PLAY currently.

Edit: in an appeal to my/our weeby side if they bought out Round One and got their access to the Japanese-imported games under their roof and pricing, easy money. I go to Round One for the Anime games but they are significantly more expensive, though they also offer bowling, darts, karaoke, etc. Same concept of breadth but more niche imo, the one near me stays consistently busy.",Tangolimanovember,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9i3ze/dave_busters_the_power_play/h3bahlp/,0.042,0.87,0.088,0.9266

Regarding this DD though, there needs to be a section discussing and evaluating the downsides of the stock, the risks and limitations, or whatever potential problems with the company/team/financials.

201,PLAY," It's pretty simple if you ever had any experience in business.

The newer stores will not generate as much revenue or profit per store on average than the older ones.

If you are a competent operator you choose the largest opportunities in revenue and profit to locate your stores first.

Then you move to smaller locations.

It's nice to fantasize about future growth and say that something will be better coming out of a pandemic. And then say that there is no way to know things because you don't work there or know anyone on the finance team. But the truth is that competent investors can figure that out. It isn't rocket science.

If you want to speculate on PLAY, by all means gamble. But don't pretend that there is no way to really dive deep and understand what the company could potentially do with detailed financial analysis. Because it is totally doable and it's likely that they are not going to do anywhere near as well as OP suggests because they have the 'potential' to grow their store counts.",LavenderAutist,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9i3ze/dave_busters_the_power_play/h3ba5bk/,0.022,0.822,0.156,0.9654

In short, I can see how many people visited AMC locations nationwide at a 1 hour resolution for anytime over the last 4 years.  I can tell you point blank that 2 million guests is not their biggest weekend since 2019 as the weekend of February 15th, 2020 had 2,380,000 guests. Beyond that, their overall traffic is simply anemic compared to what it was. They may have had one decent weekend (it's not really), but weekday visitors are WAY down. For the week ending June 20, their visitor count is down -65.57% compared to the same week in 2019. Oh, and it's down 75% compared to 2018. Want to see a graph of where we are currently?

315,CC," One thing that's worth more attention:

Selling CCs on high IV stocks can be very profitable, but everyone needs to keep in mind that a high IV means the stock could tank hard. You'll say that it's still better than the scenario where you hold 'just' shares. However, if you own just shares you can just dump them as soon as you believe the stock is going to tank. 

If you have a CC and you sell the shares then you suddenly have a naked call, and this could have margin implications, especially in meme stocks where they can tank one day (and you decide to sell the shares) and then rally the next, and that's the worst (and very real) possible combo that can wipe you out fast. 

Selling CCs on meme stocks is very dangerous simply because they will (at some point) tank hard and you'll be holding bags forever, and no amount of premium will help.

Other plays are credit call spreads, where you sell a call at strike price X and you buy one at price X+Y. Profit is limited but so is the downside. If you get the price direction right it works nicely, and even if you get it wrong you won't lose much (or you'll lose far less than holding shares at the same time).",ImFedUpWithItAll,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o99ez9/selling_covered_calls_an_underrated_and_often/h3a8xky/,0.116,0.727,0.157,0.8669

317,AMC," I‚Äôve sold covered calls for about a year straight and here‚Äôs what I learned. Don‚Äôt sell covered calls on stocks that are insanely volatile. Sure there‚Äôs money to be made, but would you want to buy AMC at 55 a share, sell your measly covered call, collect a small premium only to have to stock tank to 25 bucks? 

It‚Äôs not feasible to sell covered calls so close to the strike price. I would sell covered calls on Delta airlines for an entire year (weeklies) and got exercised 3 times doing a 5 delta or 95% out of the money.

Selling covered calls would have made me a small amount of money along the way, but one smash through your strike and you would have been better off just never selling covered calls and holding the stock by itself. 

I don‚Äôt like seeing my portfolio go up and down insane percentages in a day. With delta, usually it was anywhere from flat to +/- a couple percent day gains and losses.

 should make a point to mention the math- you'll always want to double check your strike price + premium is at least your cost basis, or have a firm belief and reason why you doubt the call will be assigned. i've definitely sold calls below my cost basis (most recently on the tail end of the june announcement), which is risky but highly profitable if done with said math and conviction in mind...oh, and definitely make sure to roll them when you're hitting 50ish percent of profit, unless there was a major downturn and you're not going to be able to get the premium+strike to protect the original investment",just_jay88,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o99ez9/selling_covered_calls_an_underrated_and_often/h3b0172/,0.042,0.773,0.185,0.974

350,AMC, Covered calls on a meme stock doesn‚Äôt seem like a good idea. You miss out on wild upswings and you might get caught holding huge bags of a shit stock like AMC till the end of time.

351,NOK," Ditto. I was bullish on $NOK... bought $NOK at $4.17 , sold $7 CCs expiring July and pocketed around $1300 premium. If NOK reaches $7 ... then my profit from the stock assignment would be around $28000.",mahe8116,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o99ez9/selling_covered_calls_an_underrated_and_often/h3b8ein/,0.0,0.889,0.111,0.4767
352,GME, My advice is watch the stock carefully if there is any chance of volitivity and you want to  keep the stock. I began sell CC's on my GME stock beginning in March. I was up a little over $16k  when GME shot up in May. It cost me about $20k to roll up so I wouldn't lose the stock. I am now back in the green on GME CC's but I push my strike prices further OTM so I don't get stung again.,crossr101,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o99ez9/selling_covered_calls_an_underrated_and_often/h3bcguz/,0.022,0.905,0.072,0.2307
353,CC," Appreciate the detail post, OP.

In any event, do you ever consider buying back the CC?

I'm long on GME, sold 3 CC Jan 2021 $500C for $115 premium 2 weeks ago when GME was in the 300ish range.

Now that GME has dropped to 200ish, I could buy back for the $60.

I still have many GME so thinking of riding it out.",feniville,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o99ez9/selling_covered_calls_an_underrated_and_often/h3bdly7/,0.0,0.956,0.044,0.4019

355,TD," So I have 100 shares of $GPRO shares, if I want to sell covered calls which selection do I choose in TD Ameritrade?

There is Buy to Open, Buy to Close, Sell to Open, Sell to Close.

356,CC," So why does fidelity track it like you're losing thousands of dollars when the stock goes above the mark? I had 100 shares of moderna and made a tidy profit because it went up 40%, but damn did it go way above where I thought it would, like 300%. I couldn't look at my fidelity account though. It would make me sick because it summarized it like I was going to have to buy 100 shares at market. 
 I thought for sure I fucked up somehow but the call came and the shares were deducted from the account and the crazy potential losses went away.

357,CC, Nice to see CCs getting some love. They also carry tax implications for short term and long term gains depending on if the CC is qualified or unqualified.

358,CL," I have been doing the same .. but I have also implemented a wheel strategy too. 

I have 145 shares of GME with an average negative cost of 0.57$ ( I have made 0.57$ per share). 

Now I have stopped doing it though as the IV is no longer the same. but moved over to AMC!!

Without selling CCs I'd be down like -2.5%. But by selling covered calls I'm up 21% not including the special dividend payout.

397,AMC," Name a stock that isn‚Äôt a meme stock that would generate 2.5% a week for 9 months that isn‚Äôt crazy risky. Like potential to go down 50% or completely blow through your strike. 

If AMC is 55 bucks you can‚Äôt just sell 56, 60 or even 65 strikes every week and expect to profit. 

AMC could go down to 30, it could also blow to 70 and you‚Äôd miss out on the gains cuz you would be exercised.

I know this is wallstreet bets and it‚Äôs an unpopular opinion but dumping your entire account into meme stocks is a terrible idea. Sure hindsight is always 20/20 wished I would have done it. But it‚Äôs all about preservation of capital. You don‚Äôt want to be invested in something that has the potential to take a massive chunk out of your account. 

Sure you could say that for stocks in general but sticking to things like the SPY, or giant tech companies like Apple, Google, amazon, fb etc is probably the better way to go. Yes I know they could tank too but look at their daily moves. They‚Äôre not bouncing around up and down 5% a day. What‚Äôs the likelyhood of the spy, amc, Google or amzn halving? Probably not much, and if they did that would probably be the least of everyone‚Äôs concerns because something major probably happened. 

I‚Äôm not here to tell you not to do it, and yes there‚Äôs people that make a lot off of it. If you bought in at 10-30 bucks then sure go for it because your gains are already massive. But the wallstreet bets/ yolo options meme stock buying is kind of ridiculous. You see these massive gains but go look at the loss porn. 

Investing is all about transferring wealth trough time. What‚Äôs the point if your account halves or someone yolo‚Äôs options? 

Slow and steady growth isn‚Äôt sexy but at the end of the day you still have your money.",Grant_30,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o99ez9/selling_covered_calls_an_underrated_and_often/h3a8tda/,0.057,0.788,0.154,0.9887
398,AMC," Also if you had 100k and were generating 2.5% a week compounding for 9 months which is 39 weeks. You go from 100k to 262. 

Or even 10k to 26.2k. 

In my opinion not doable due to the potential downside risk of the stock and or the price going through the roof. 

If you wanted to play it safe in covered calls, you sell out of the money. Not one or two strikes out either. You probably couldn‚Äôt do a 70delta on AMC for weeklies. Realistically a 90-95 to play it safe so you could actually see some of the stock gains but the trade off is the premium collected is much smaller. 

There‚Äôs no magic one sized fits all selling covered calls and you have to be ready for weeks it makes massive gains or losses. I wish it was easy just to sell the first strike out of the money or sell 70 covered calls since that‚Äôs a top. You could probably get away with it but even at 55 what does a 70 covered call get you? Just checked on a 100k account you could get 2600 for the week. That‚Äôs looking at Friday data so Monday would probably be lower due to time decay or whatever happens to the stock price. And the delta is 87 which I could live with 

Here‚Äôs the thing. You generate let‚Äôs say 2.5k on a 100k account. If the stock goes down 2% or $1 you‚Äôve already lost the difference. 

And then you keep holding cuz you like the stock and a month from now it might be 40 bucks. You probably would have lost way more than what your covered calls even generated.

Viac makes its money in traditional channels like cable tv, movie theaters but is shifting over to be  much more in streaming ‚Äî- partnering and selling content to players like Netflix, Amazon, Apple,  but also through its own subscription services - Paramount +, Showtime and Epix.

1277,NFLX," It‚Äôs not a good comparison and that popular comparison is why the stock has been  overlooked. 

P+ is streaming but it‚Äôs it‚Äôs own niche in streaming - not all streaming competes with Netflix and they aren‚Äôt trying to replace Netflix. Streaming is not going to be a 1 service game anymore that‚Äôs going to change and it already has started. 

They aren‚Äôt trying to take share of NFLX or Prime‚Äî- they‚Äôre after the final slice of the chord cutters from the cable tv market.  It‚Äôs much more of a cable tv replacement.  Afterall they still produce tons of content for Prime exclusive  (which viac owns, but Amazon pays for production and short term exclusivity) . Viac still needs Netflix afterall as a distribution partner and vice versa. 

What does Netflix not have that you‚Äôd still need cable tv for? 

Other than a shit ton of content News+live sports and a lot of tv-style programming would be up there as well as older kids/teen content.

1349,OI," 'Gamma squeeze' is when a market maker, or trader has to delta hedge options that they have sold. If you sell an option you immediately take on a short position essentially equivalent to the delta of the option\*100. So for a 0.3 delta option the short position is equal to 30 shares. So delta hedging (in its simplest form) is when they then buy those 30 shares so that they remain delta neutral, i.e. -0.3\*100( from selling a 0.3delta call) + 30 (the shares they bought) = 0. As the price moves up the delta moves up (due to gamma) so they have to buy more shares to cover the delta increase.

If the float is tight enough and/or the OI is large enough as they delta hedge, the price will move up faster than they can cover. As the price moves up they have to cover more, so the price moves up, so they have to cover more, etc. That's a gamma squeeze and its to do with the mechanics of market makers (or others) seeking to remain delta neutral. This typically isn't to do with institutions ownership, that's a separate thing (unless they are playing games with selling options which can happen as well).",triedandtested365,100,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9ih66/wish_gama_squeeze_question/h3bjfcc/,0.0,0.937,0.063,0.872

1363,AMC," There's probably many ways of setting up a gamma squeeze but 2 simplified ones;

1. Randoms buying loads of options, brute forcing a gamma squeeze, probably what happened on something like CLNE
2. Options purchased with precision, set up probably by hedge funds. This would likely be done through buying up the far OTM calls, and then working closer to ATM so that there is a 'ramp' set up. Probably happened on AMC and GME

No.2 depends on knowing things like the float, how MMs are likely to hedge, number of options to cause an increase in price etc. I think no.2 is probably beyond retail investors to coordinate, so retail essentially work with no.1 to try to force a gamma squeeze.

1373,NTLA," Goldman isn't dumb.

Please understand the nuances of CRISPR technology and gene editing.  

It's a metric fuck ton easier to *silence* (aka turn-off) a gene using CRISPR than it is to actually repair a gene with a mutation.  The results from NTLA are for turning off a gene.  They haven't actually corrected any genes. Other success with CRISPR is largely relegated to ex-vivo editing ideas. 

CRISPR is very good at cutting DNA, so it doesn't matter if your repair process is bad when you want to turn something off.  In fact, you want a bad repair process when turning off something, because it ends up silencing the gene.  When you need to actually repair a gene, however, you need much better repair.  For CRISPR, that's largely mediated by the NHEJ and HDR pathways. Both of those are pretty inefficient, and very difficult to control for a myriad of reasons.  NTLA picked a very good application, because therapeutic benefits occur when you shut something off.  

There's still a long, looooong way to go though for when it comes to fixing a defective gene that you need and can't shutoff.  There will be successes....it'll highly depend on how wisely companies pick their indications.  But after the euphoria wears off, over the long run, profits will actually matter.  It'll take some time before we are all convinced that indications with very limited populations will be able to produce meaningful profits.",JhoLow_1MDB,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9l4zb/edit_is_going_to_bust_goldman_sachs_goldman_is/h3ckyam/,0.078,0.766,0.156,0.9695

1483,SPCE," SPCE should be at least an $8bn business by 2026, based on ¬£600k per seat, 6 global spaceports, starting commercial operation in New Mexico in 2022, and expanding to another 5 sites by 2026. Italy, Sweden, UAE already in discussion, with Asia and Australia likely candidates. 

There is no real competition with X or BO, which are different experiences, comfort levels and price points. Every space tourism company will have an endless line of customers. There are 1.5 million high net worth individuals in the US, never mind the millions globally. Everybody wins in space!

Given that growth businesses operate at a 10-20 times multiple, that would put the 2026 stock price between $350-700 on a conservative outlook. Today it's a bargain at $55. It is a fantastic long term and short term play! 

It's the Tesla of space tourism and should rocket at each big step in the next couple of months. I expect SPCE to hit around 80-100 sometime this year.

I wouldn‚Äôt touch VG with a 10 foot pole. Only reason they are trending is because they are the only vehicle producing company available on open market.

I think it will be a week or so after, before Bezos goes up, but I do not think Branson will be on it. VG has a test plan, and I think they stick to it, and that Branson goes up 2-4 weeks after this first next flight. (Again, though, the exact timeframe has NOT been published.) after Friday's run up, I expect a dip on little-to-no updates this week. I hope to use that dip to buy a few OTM calls for the end of July and a few for August. I wouldn't buy earlier than that. IV will plummet if they don't fly/announce soon enough and you could easily get caught with your shorts around your ankles.

Set aside that, I have serious questions about the actual launch cadence for VG, because their liquid/solid hybrid engine is going to have a far longer turnaround time and less performance than a pure liquid engine, and is more complex than a pure solid engine (and probably longer turnaround too). It may fit their needs, but I truly wonder what their launch cadence will be running at operational speed.",hunter994,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o97e16/spce_due_diligence/h3al36r/,0.059,0.883,0.059,0.4588

1786,NNDM," Last fall, NNDM continually held stock offerings to raise money. Yoav Stern, who heads the company, knew that although the product (Dragonfly 3D printer) they offer is revolutionary, the actual function of the machine was not up to snuff for mass production, which is what they seek to make the company successful. It‚Äôs a lot of technical jargon, but it pretty much comes down to this: the Dragonfly can print circuit boards that actually do work, but they are prone to failure due to the nozzles that spit the material not being refined enough to do real detailed work. 

Think of it as operating on someone with a hatchet instead of a scalpel. Yes, you can sharpen a hatchet enough that it makes a clean cut, but DAMN would it be nice to have something a little smaller and more precise to do better work. The other problem is that it‚Äôs really fixing hard to dictate all the steps a machine like that needs to go through to consistently perform such complex tasks. If only the machine could ‚Äúlearn‚Äù as it makes mistakes, maybe it could teach itself to do a better job as time goes on (more on this later).

So anyways, now Yoav and his buddies have a metric shit ton of cash after all the offerings. He goes shopping for the two things he needs to make this tech really feasible: machine learning/A.I., and smaller, more accurate components to scale for precision. This is where his most recent acquisitions come in. DeepCube, Micro Mechanical, and Nano Fabrica. 

These companies are exactly what he needs to bring his newest product (Dragonfly 2.0) to market with the ability to print consistent, repeatable, quality circuit boards on a grand/mass production scale. And thanks to the stock offerings, they have $1.4B left after the acquisitions to actually do it.

1801,UBER," the most upvoted comment here speaks for itself, there's no shortage of fat or stupid people so these companies will keep printing cash.

It's really hard to bet against large tech because the timing is just so tough when you go short or buy put options.  I bought a ton of puts on UBER a while ago, hate the company, hate how they treat drivers, and I don't think their valuation is worth at all where its at.  I got lucky and UBER tanked and I got a quick profit, but if nothing happened or it tanked after my puts expired I would have lost 100%.  

It's a tough game, so best to focus on going long companies you like and not holding companies you don't.

AMD has the (provisional)deadline for the EU approval for the Xilinx deal coming up on June 30th (UK july 6th), and I would assume that the recent run up in price is related to the assumption that this approval goes through.

I sometimes take said yield and scope out the next meme stock and then reinvest those gains into my two yield stocks on the dip. So when and if I decide to sell, I will make a gain. However it just deposits money for as long as I hold it. so far the yield is 7 percent but is cheaper than at&t per share. Dividend yield for new retards is when you get a percentage of your investment back when that company generates a profit instead of cashing out on the peak so you don't have to constantly watch it.  So tl;dr, I make a huge deposit into my safety net. Wait for the payout. Yolo into the risky stocks. Wait for the peak and sell. Then rinse the new take back into my safe stock. The more I have as the yield percentage goes up, the more I make to gamble with.  And I basically just grow one stock every week until the next quarter.

2020,IP," micron is the only US manufacturer of note for DRAM. 

Its an IP moated industry. 

Infrastructure deal. 

People use computers for stuff and we need more computer stuff. Demand for computer stuff is going to rise in the future. It will continue to rise. 

DRAM market is an oligopoly. There is tacit collusion to keep supply down to keep prices and margin high. Market participants arent stupid this time around. Its in nobodys interest like Samsung or SK Hynix to rock the boat. Not only that, South Korea is a strategic ally of the US. They will do back channel pressure if they think Korea is trying to kill off Micron by flooding the market. As a result, Micron is de facto protected by the US government being in a strategically important industry.

Unless there is a massive antitrust/comp investigation or other event that causes them to need cash urgently, I forsee minor supply shortage basically forever. 

Micron also tends to dump post earnings, so be careful when trading. Forget weeklies and stuff in case you get tech issues in small timing windows. 

The revenue beat is all priced in. Including the fact that the beat will be more than what they announced already. Market knows how Sanjay likes to run into ER calls. What matters the most is guidance. 

Buy the stock or leaps. 

Forget about the stock for 6+ months.

$WISH is a long term investment. Fundamentals are great(they have shit ton of money), but they can't go to the moon short term. Whereas for AMC has a very low institutional share percentage of around 12%(source: fidelity). Not saying it is a bad stock, it's just not a stock for the short term.

2065,ZG," I like your thought process. Heres a couple things to think on.

OPEN. - open door technologies is providing tech to millions of new homes, like when people buy a new home. Not a REIT - but a good play since millions of people will be moving this year.

ZG - zillow group is tragically underpriced right now according to analysts. If you search analysts pricing models and charts ZG averages between 150 to 170 and its selling for....$118 - and millions of people will use zillows web products as they buy and sell homes this year.

Good REITs i own and love:
ANLY
SBRA
CTRE
ACRE

Ps. He asked for advice. So i offered it. If any of my REITs are considered below desired wsb market cap please dont delete my post. REITs dont always have $10 billion capital or whatever your rule is because that is not exactly how REITs work.

Dividends. All 4 REITs mentioned have big dividend payouts. Averaging around 6 to 8%
