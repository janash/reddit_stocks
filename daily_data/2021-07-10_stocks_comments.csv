0,BB," This advice only works if the stock is actually good. Not all are; sometimes stocks *do* fall to zero or fail to ever recover. So, ultimately this is harmful advice when generalized. Maybe for ETFs this is fine advice, but otherwise it really isn't.

6,LVS," this is a bad suggestion for many people, even for TSM a few months back. Look at many high fly stocks crash you would know holding sometimes is not good. I currently have TSM, and I know there is enough support to keep it at current price level, however I do regret buying it at the price as I overpaid it, but there is hope that this will come back up in not distant future.

I had many stocks bought in Nov 2020, and I could not hold them all the way down as when I realize I have no idea how to value a company, it's better for me to cut the loss. It turns out half the loss cut turns out great, and the other half the loss cut were wrong.

So before you suggest people to hold, you have to make sure they know how to value a company and there is enough risk management, simply asking people to hold is super bad. 

Look at Penn, LVS and many chinese stocks, you would know hold a loser for too long is a big mistake",hpad06,12,/r/stocks/comments/oh9905/a_word_to_new_investors_hold/h4nwiwk/,0.207,0.661,0.132,-0.9162

IMO you shouldn't sell a good stock only if the company changed its policy or its leadership and you aren't comfortable with the new people changes...

76,ALL," Probably gonna get downvoted but RBLX. I feel their growth is quite capped given they have to fight with giants like APPL (apps), MSFT (Minecraft), NFLX among other for kids spending time in their platform AND paying for premium content. 

I was checking their investors presentation some months ago and I was very unimpressed.

My reasoning was:
- They target under 15 years. As of mid-2020, about 26 percent of the world's population were under 15 years old. In 2020, there were 7,800,000,000 people. 
- Their average spending per PAYING USER was around 15$/month. 

Simple maths. Let's give them the absolute best scenario: ALL kids in the world PLAY and PAY for Roblox. This means 7,800,000,000 x 26% x 15 each month. This accounts for 30,420,000,000 $ or 30.42B$. Per year this means around 365B$ revenue. 

We could throw Price to Sales ratio or Price to Earnings estimations here based on margins but let's give them a VERY reasonable PER of 10 and a gross margin of 50%. Earnings would be 182.5$. So market cap would be 1.82T$. After giving them the absolute best scenario you can only come up with the current market cap of Amazon? I'm sorry but I'm not impressed. Realistically I would say they might be closer to 1/10 so 182B$ market cap. 

Currently they are at 50B$. Thanks but no thanks.

The solar panel market is crowded and it's a commoditized race to the bottom.

134,AI," Came here to see a bunch of people say this. Surprised to find it so far down, even more surprised to see such a reasonable explanation for why.

As a Tesla investor I still disagree with most of your points and expect to see the stock price 10x before the end of the decade as Tesla starts generating high margin revenues from robotaxis, app store sales and their AI energy distribution software. That said, I can see your reasons for caution with the stock and they should certainly be considered as risk.

As for the individual points and why I think Tesla will overcome them:

1. The Musk premium is certainly a factor, but I don't see it going away any time soon. Unless Musk leaves Tesla, I don't see this as a negative in the foreseeable future. As for FSD, if you look at the trajectory of the improvements, it's very clear that it's been improving exponentially ever since they released the beta. It's impossible to say exactly when it'll be good enough for mass adoption, but if past AI learning patterns are any indicator it will happen much sooner than people expect.

2. Tesla's service will probably remain problematic as it's a real drag on an EV company, where as it's the main profit driver for ICE manufacturer's. That said, the quality of the cars from Giga China are already much better, and Giga Texas and Berlin are said to be the real improvements. On top of that, other automakers have much bigger issues than quality control, their EVs (I've driven a ton) simply suck on almost all accounts compared to the Teslas.

3. There's no competition. Ford's Mach-E is starting to have demand issues already and has the same quality control issues as the early Tesla models. The F-150 certainly will do well, but it has worse specs for almost double the price and the Cybertruck had way more reservations. Eventually even the Ford fanboys will find out that they're overpaying like crazy.

As for competitors catching up, so far I only see them falling further behind and they're not even in the phase where their entire company will become unprofitable as they switch completely to EVs.

> Food-delivery companies did record-breaking business during the pandemic, as millions of homebound Americans embraced the idea of ordering dinner via smartphone apps. Their valuations skyrocketed. They acquired reams of data that helped increase their efficiency. **There was just one problem: Even at the height of their success, they weren‚Äôt making any money.** 

-

> After accounting for advertising costs and refunds to customers, among other operational expenses, DoorDash on average is left with 2.5% of a customer‚Äôs overall bill, according to a Deutsche Bank analysis. **That means DoorDash ended up with 90 cents on the average order during the height of the pandemic, worth around $36**. 

You got your $30-$40 per order correct, but DD makes less than $1 from that order, not $11.  


> The math isn‚Äôt pretty, but it‚Äôs the best in the industry.

180,VC," This.

And it seems to be growing less profitable by the day. Ride subsidies are disappearing, prices are going up and drivers are becoming more unhappy/less willing to put up with these app‚Äôs bullshit.

Their model was based on disrupting the space to the point where public transit and existing transport companies disappeared, and then raising prices to an actually sustainable profit point/cutting down labor costs with fleets of self-driving cars.

But, it seems like the pandemic drove a stake through those plans with the double whammy of propping up transit systems with relief funds and gutting the user bases Uber and Lyft had built up.

I think they‚Äôre going to need to spend a ton of cash to (re)acquire customers who haven‚Äôt used them in a year and gotta think a ton of VC companies are going to have a hard time going back to that well, given how the weaknesses in these models have been exposed and the growing choosiness/strength of the labor pool.

I think the one year of the pandemic set Lyft and Uber back closer to 5, in terms of their long term plans.

193,PSTH," A fascinating question.

The companies that have the highest likelihood of survival are (unsurprisingly) the most conservative ones. The list of oldest continuing businesses frequently includes farms, taverns, law firms, and boutique banks.

I am going to ignore them here and limit this to public companies.

I would bet on companies that have a full VRIO moat ‚Äî access to valuable, rare, and inimitable resources paired with the organisational capability to extract value from them.

I am looking for companies that exercise control over their supply chain, manage complex problems (including logistics), and can maintain customer loyalty through virtuous cycles such as inertia and cultural transmission.

**Universal Music Group** is the market share leader in the global oligopoly of music licensing, and renews its franchise by maintaining a pipeline of organic or ‚Äòmanufactured‚Äô musical talent. UMG at the moment can only be accessed through PSTH.

**Disney** is an easy second choice, for similar reasons but in the film industry. Disney has a proven ability to produce original content in-house that becomes a brand in itself based on cinematic style and thematic unity. Thus Disney owns multiple brands (including Disney itself) that can drive viewership on the strength of their brand alone, and since these are for the most part targeted towards a younger audience, the brand association is built at a young age and creates an intergenerational cycle of lifelong loyalty.

This is further reinforced by their amusement parks business, which can continue to grow faster than the economy. Disney has so far developed only \~50% of the land it owns in Florida, for example.

And of course, my grandchildren will probably be be using TI-83 despite their brain-machine interfaces, so probably **Texas Instruments**.",market-unmaker,7,/r/stocks/comments/oh6ktk/whats_a_company_that_youre_confident_is_going_to/h4oe5zl/,0.02,0.857,0.123,0.9811

233,AC," In about 40 years or so much of current coastline (some of the most important economic zones) will be completely underwater, agriculture will be massively disrupted by atmospheric compositions and intolerable heat, as well as a dramatic lack of clean and usable water. There will be massive migration as much of the world becomes completely unliveable. Not to mention the severe weather that will plague those places that are still surviveable. 

Life as we know it will be completely over. Even if we were to be ‚Äúnet zero‚Äù by 2030 or whatever moving goal post current leaders have in place, we are and would be too far gone. Feedback loops will accelerate the warming massively. Greenhouse gases stored in the ground, ocean, and most prominently arctic ice (huge amounts of methane trapped in the ice, a gas that is dozens of times more damaging than CO2), will be released as the earth heats up. As more and more of the earth gets covered in water (which is dark), more and more heat will be drawn into the earth. 

The scientific community has been screaming about this for decades upon decades, and we have sat back, cranked up the AC, turned on Fox News, and tuned them out. We‚Äôre only beginning to see the impacts of emissions from years past. Meanwhile we‚Äôve only continued to grow them exponentially.

239,BABA," love how bearish everyone is here

1. if you pay attention, US congress is using the same aggressive rhetoric against our own big tech that China is. Facebook, Google et al have been getting sued for years now regarding shady data use. most people in the country, especially those that dont invest, are against the abusive practices by the megacaps and want to see Amazon broken up
2. China is IMO doing the right thing w/ regard to abusive monopoly practices, privacy issues & data gathering, not to mention the cowboy lending in the shadow banking sector. there are so many crappy loans and defaults in China because it's been the wild west for years. Ant Group and other pseudo-banks should be regulated
3. a lot of Chinese IPOs are complete BS. they list on the Nasdaq because rules are far more lax than the Chinese or Hong Kong exchanges. these IPOs should not be allowed to go through. im not talking about Didi or any other high profile name, but the garbage that you never hear about that drops straight from launch (HAPP)
4. for the real companies like Didi, China wants them to list on their own exchanges. they want to legitimize these exchanges and keep money & interest in China. plus, they can police them better that way because, yes, its China. if they're listed on US exchanges, they have to hand over info to the US regulators
5. Huya + Douyu would have been a legit monoply with 80%+ market share. great for Tencent who owns both, terrible for consumers.  it would be like if Twitch and Youtube merged and Amazon happened to own a majority stake in both. nobody really expected this deal to go through without significant concessions by Tencent, which is why Huya has had such a huge short interest (long Douyu, short Huya)

finally, my biggest gripe is the psuedo-ownership via ADRs that they got going on. you can buy shares directly on the Hong Kong exchange for some like BABA and Tencent and thus bypass it, but there are still issues with foreign ownership. this has been long been a grey area, but i expect it will finally be clarified in the next few months. that would be very welcome

my advice is to ignore the noise. companies like BABA and Tencent are not going anywhere. China is not going to kill their crown jewels and discourage capital investment in their country forever

when all is said and done, I expect this will have been an amazing buying opportunity. sentiment driven sell offs usually are.

as another poster pointed out, the real bear case with Chinese stocks is that the average Chinese person is not all that interesed in stocks as an investment. for them, thats real estate. the USA is unique in that it has so much passive money flowing into the megacaps via everybody's 401k and pension plans

4. for the real companies like Didi, China wants them to list on their own exchanges. they want to legitimize these exchanges and keep money & interest in China. plus, they can police them better that way because, yes, its China. if they're listed on US exchanges, they have to hand over info to the US regulators
5. Huya + Douyu would have been a legit monoply with 80%+ market share. great for Tencent who owns both, terrible for consumers.  it would be like if Twitch and Youtube merged and Amazon happened to own a majority stake in both. nobody really expected this deal to go through without significant concessions by Tencent, which is why Huya has had such a huge short interest (long Douyu, short Huya)

finally, my biggest gripe is the psuedo-ownership via ADRs that they got going on. you can buy shares directly on the Hong Kong exchange for some like BABA and Tencent and thus bypass it, but there are still issues with foreign ownership. this has been long been a grey area, but i expect it will finally be clarified in the next few months. that would be very welcome

my advice is to ignore the noise. companies like BABA and Tencent are not going anywhere. China is not going to kill their crown jewels and discourage capital investment in their country forever

when all is said and done, I expect this will have been an amazing buying opportunity. sentiment driven sell offs usually are.

as another poster pointed out, the real bear case with Chinese stocks is that the average Chinese person is not all that interesed in stocks as an investment. for them, thats real estate. the USA is unique in that it has so much passive money flowing into the megacaps via everybody's 401k and pension plans

1. if you pay attention, US congress is using the same aggressive rhetoric against our own big tech that China is. Facebook, Google et al have been getting sued for years now regarding shady data use. most people in the country, especially those that dont invest, are against the abusive practices by the megacaps and want to see Amazon broken up
2. China is IMO doing the right thing w/ regard to abusive monopoly practices, privacy issues & data gathering, not to mention the cowboy lending in the shadow banking sector. there are so many crappy loans and defaults in China because it's been the wild west for years.

What‚Äôs happening here is China is taking a step back from Capitalism. The first sign was the purge of corrupt officials. The purge happened because Xi was worried corrupt officials could be corrupted by other Chinese or foreign adversaries. From Xi‚Äôs standpoint, purging corruption made his control over the party more secure because he got rid of people who would have sold out him or China.

That brings us to Co‚Äôs billionaire problem. Xi is making himself the party and getting rid of the rotating chairmanship. That‚Äôs new. Xi is building on the corruption purge by reducing the power and influence of China‚Äôs tech magnates.

Looking ahead, there‚Äôs going to be an exodus of Capital from China. Guess where that money is headed? By and large the good ol‚Äô usa.

It is quite silly how many Americans can only see the world through their country's way of doing things.
Many countries in Europe (and around the world) are the same, with strict anti monopoly regulations (that maybe hurt big companies, but are good on the long term for consumers). I love Amazon/BABA as an investor, but I would feel better in a world where there is not a company owning 20%-50% of all online sales. The fact USA is not doing those antimonopoly things doesn't speak bad of China, but of America.

Also your point with companies listing on the Nasdaq, it is a shame how little they are scrutinized by the authorities and the investors. It is like printing money, companies will try to go there always, because it is the easiest way to earn money, fighting for a 0.5% of customers is hard and extenuating. Selling paper to greedy investors it's so much fun for them.

255,NIO," Well I've considerd that. A lot of the companies I'm invested in have dual listing in other exhanges as well not traded on the Cayman islands. But I don't actually have a problem with ADRs. NIO is one of biggest holdings along with BYDD and Alibaba. For me personally, it doesn't matter. Because I've considerd the probabilities. Other smarter people than my self don't see a problem either like Ray Dalio, Warren Buffet, and Charlie Munger, just some examples here.

I'm American, military family, strong patriotism. But I'm 4th generation. I have family all around the world . We have businesses and those who dabble in equity trading and asset management.

I am not any of the above. But I have seen enough and done enough research where I am confident. I see the flaws in the U.S which has allowed me personally to always be 1 step ahead of my peers. 

I also consider the political, economical, socioeconomic, and more when evaluating a company. So after personl research, I don't see the risk as bad as maybe you do. I also think there is strong biases against Chinese for terrible and financial purposes. I could go on and on. But my actions and decisions have been good so far. And I choose to be one of the who deviates from the norm at this time. I do a lot of research and my studies involve foreign financial markets. This will most likely be my choice of trade.
I've also worked in social/psychology. So I actively try to make sense of the markets. Imo the markets has much more psychological aspects than I think should be. I think most people who dislike Chinese companies don't really have your best interests. It's not a zero sum game. And I'm going to be honest. I think a lot of people are disengeous.

264,ATH," Could be a little overvalued but you can say that about lots of tech companies.

Who's the competition? Apple music? Tidal is a flop and shows exactly how hard it is to do this. Spotify is a well know brand dating back a decade and as you noted has a great user interface. People who are subscribed are pretty sticky customers.

Additionally you want to try and knock a company for raising debt in a historically low interest rate environment. This i would say is a great move. They're expanding content and who knows what else but taking basically free cash seems like a prudent thing to do.

They're only valued at 262 currently, the ATH was north of 350.

You say how expensive royalties are but then how they pay the least. I'm confused here. Few artists can dictate their terms and in those instances Spotify will price themselves appropriately. There isn't much competition artists can choose apple music, YouTube, or Spotify. In most cases they won't limit themselves to one platform. I'd liken this to consoles trying to have specific content.

I see a future wherein Universal, Sony and Warner will start making their own streaming business (UMG owns 2-5% of Spotify) and put pressure on Spotify, eventually leading to acquisition- today‚Äôs valuation would indicate Spotify buying the content creator (network of artists in true sense) WMG but unless they make that move either Sony or UMG (with their newly minted treasure trove after listing) will acquire Spotify!!",Turbulent_Bit8683,1,/r/stocks/comments/oh74tp/is_there_still_a_bullish_case_for_spotify_time_is/h4q2jgb/,0.021,0.913,0.066,0.7526

FSD is like google maps the way I see it.  The first company working on it will have a huge advantage being first to market.  R&D on this is perhaps the #1 factor for success of the program.  Check out [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXHiPrwUQKA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXHiPrwUQKA) this clip and tell me you're not impressed.  Notice how the FSD has a few hiccups on some complicated driving situations and the user sends in a ticket report for the team to take a closer look at.  Stuff like that is huuuge for advancing the program.  I believe other companies are working on their FSD but Tesla has had beta out to the public for over a year and are on version 9 now.  Tickets come from hundreds of thousands of users over the past year and into the future means FSD is improving rapidly, faster than their competition.

Lastly what TBC is doing is different than any other boring company so the fact they aren't as big or experienced or well financed means nothing.  Its an entirely new idea.  Underground roads.  You couldn't make roads like this b4 since we had ICEV.  Full electric means no emissions.  Full self driving in tunnels is as easy as on the freeway, probably easier since no lane switching.  And since you've limited access to the tunnels to only Tesla cars, you can implement network based traffic software which is the next logical step after FSD is complete.  This would be the ultimate solution to traffic is this supposed network based traffic control type system where the wifi in the tunnel tells the cars how to behave and where each other are.

331,OGN," I wouldn‚Äôt go too deep as the company isn‚Äôt going to show growth and might well show revenue contraction in the coming three years as they lose exclusivity on some of their drugs. This is a $250M headwind. Management say they can offset this with organic growth, but it remains to be seen. 

They also have rather a heavy manufacturing footprint, many different SKUs and many different manufacturing sites. Not efficient. They need to rationalise that a bit better to improve margins and grow earnings in spite of modest expected sales growth. 

But in general I think the market is irrationally nervous of this company and the price is too low. Current p/e of around 5, and ev / cash flow of around the same, it doesn‚Äôt need to grow to generate 20% returns from this price point.

364,CHKP," It's not a crazy idea and a lot of people do exactly that and there are websites who sell/advertise hedge fund positioning (insider monkey).  

The downside is that the hedge funds usually ""hedge"" their positioning,  for example,  I own 200 shares of CHKP, a big cyber security company,  it has a fairly high amount of shorts because it is big and stable,  a hedge fund can buy a small cyber security company and short CHKP to make a pure bet on the long company going up relative to the other cyber security stocks.   If the economy goes south (when everything goes down) they make money on CHKP down and lose money on whatever long they have,  canceling each other out.   They make money if the long outperforms even in a down market. 

You can follow, but you likely aren't going to hedge,  or use complex options to match what they do.  It will likely work in a bull market,  but lead to very large losses in a bear market.

I told my self ""if Ray Dalio invests in NIO in 2020, I may be on to something."" Surely enough, bridgewater did. And it assured me that maybe my investment strategy was okay after all.

So I bought Tesla in 2018 and 2019. In 2020 I started to sell Tesla off in Q4 of 2020 and Q1 of 2021. I still own a lot but I started to put more into NIO and cash waiting for a market correction. I then saw Ballie Gifford an early Tesla investor sell Tesla and buy more NIO. This was a nod to me that I was maybe doing the right thing. 

I bought Alibaba in the 100s. And when Charlie Munger picked up Alibaba, that was a nod that maybe I was right.

I also generally just keep an eye to look out for things in everyday life. Casual conversations or just walking around town or travelling can lead to some good investments.

375,DD," Watch the news and read all the news stories you can get your hands on. That doesn't mean run out and buy what they're peddling but it helps with ideas.

 I develop watch lists with many stocks and review them a few times a day (quick scan). If I think something may move based on something I've seen or read I move it to my ""weekly"" list for a closer look. This list is much shorter and I review it nightly and if I think the timing is right I move it to ""today"" for a next day buy. This gives me a really good feel for the stocks in my list. 

I also love lists, which even if you open an account just for the lists on robinhood, it's worthwhile. Lists like most popular on robinhood, top movers and stocks by sectors are great to browse. 

Do your own DD as you add to your own lists and that way a quick glance is usually all you need to make a decision.

If say fb order fills then goog and amzn will be canceled as you have not enough funds but nvda will stay.

Their earnings per share growth is lower than the other 3 tech companies, and the upside is not as high because their business revolves around Laptops and Phones that have legit competition in those spaces (Mac has like 10% of the US computer market share when including businesses).
