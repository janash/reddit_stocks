72,PT," It seems people who hate SNDL only know one thing about the company and ignore everything else. They only think it's bad because of the share floats from dilution. Little did they know that the dilution helped them get out of debt with millions of cash on hand. Which allowed them to acquire companies and diversify their business. Weed bank, SPAC, retail stores, etc. This is not a stock you want to throw your rent money at and hope it doubles next month before you have to withdraw. It's a long term play that you set and wait for 3 years. The CEO knows what he's doing. He's thinking outside the box way more than the similar companies to the point where he has no competitors anymore. It is currently way undervalued and with all the recent news and upgrade PT, it's like a no brainer. Once weed stocks stops getting attacked, you will see this run faster than the others.  


Hint: Float size alone does not determine about how fast a stock can run up or down. It's the market cap that matters more. People don't care about how many shares they buy, they care how much dollars they buy it with.

73,SNDL," It seems people who hate SNDL only know one thing about the company and ignore everything else. They only think it's bad because of the share floats from dilution. Little did they know that the dilution helped them get out of debt with millions of cash on hand. Which allowed them to acquire companies and diversify their business. Weed bank, SPAC, retail stores, etc. This is not a stock you want to throw your rent money at and hope it doubles next month before you have to withdraw. It's a long term play that you set and wait for 3 years. The CEO knows what he's doing. He's thinking outside the box way more than the similar companies to the point where he has no competitors anymore. It is currently way undervalued and with all the recent news and upgrade PT, it's like a no brainer. Once weed stocks stops getting attacked, you will see this run faster than the others.

104,SNDL," What. That‚Äôs just completely incorrect. Sure some people may have shit on his bet, but the guy backed up all his plays with research and evidence. SNDL has none of that and is just a dogshit company. The only reason it went up to $3.95/share was because it was heavily pumped by some big institution, and then dropped again when they pulled out. I was lucky and was able to buy 300 shares at $1.20/ share, and sold the next day (put in a market sellüëåüèª) for $3.95 and it was filled. Made a good chunk of change. But that‚Äôs not going to happen again.

Now, for this guy, buying so many shares at such a low price, literally any movement in either direction will result in massive profit or loss. I will be interested to see how he fares, but I wouldn‚Äôt touch SNDL again at all.

513,SF," I think one thing that happened at the beginning of the pandemic is that families moved back in together.

For example, say you were a student going to school at university living on campus. Pandemic happens and you move back in with mom and dad because of sheltering and not want to be stuck on campus.

So as the pandemic ""ended"" those students / graduates are now moving back out. And they take up apartments. (Which is why you are noticing this phenomena now; and not throughout the pandemic.)

This just one factor on top of many others happening (including moratoriums and work from wherever).

It'll take time to work through these things.

If you look at the rental data you'll see that some cities saw huge price drops like LA, NY, Seattle, and SF while smaller cities saw price increases.

I don't think anyone knows what pricing will be long term. Too many factors competing against each other to know where things will land.

Personally I'm just looking to be opportunistic. Keeping an eye out at different things I have recognized in the economy that could drive things one way or the other. And once I feel a thesis has been confirmed, I will act accordingly.

Lumber was just one example of the multiple factors and playing into everything. But that turned out to be what I thought it was; a supply shock resulting from the pandemic. Prices haven't fallen where they should at retail yet, but they have on the futures markets. Oil is probably next. And the biggest risk is an oversupply at some point. (But that may not ever come).",LavenderAutist,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oocxuz/analysis_the_economic_impact_of_ending_the/h5xq4hm/,0.036,0.932,0.033,-0.2134

516,MPC," Here: I wrote this a while back here: https://moongangcapital.com/2021/03/27/why-traders-pay-attention-to-the-federal-reserve-monetary-policy-inflation/

‚ÄúThe MPC is a term used to describe the rate by which consumers spend and save a sudden boost in income. So in our business example, if the business saves 20% of their increased revenue and spends 80%, they have a Marginal Propensity to Consume at a rate of 80%. As a result we can say the MPC multiplier is [1/(1-0.8)] which translates to every $1 received results in an additional $5 spent in the economy. Should the average consumer save 30% of their income and spend 70%, the MPC multiplier drops to $3.33 spent in the economy for every $1 received. If the average consumer spends 90% of their income and saves 10%, the MPC skyrockets to an additional $10.00 spent in the economy for every $1 received. In short, low interest rates can incentivize borrowing which leads to a great amount of spending in the economy! The less people save, the more people borrow, the higher the consumption. It important to note how things can quickly shift if there is a significant change to the MPC. And the MPC is completely controlled by the consumer, and how confident the consumer is amid current economic conditions. Although the Fed can incentive consumer spending, and therefore the MPC multiple, by lowering interest rates.‚Äù",Trading-Resources,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oocxuz/analysis_the_economic_impact_of_ending_the/h60ezgc/,0.017,0.839,0.144,0.9817

530,FSD," $200/month for FSD translates to $5/hr for the average commuter. Imagine the Tesla supercomputer and Starlink working together to route customers through busy city streets, around traffic jams - the whole time letting the customer maintain a calm, cool state of mind. 

That's cheap af. 

And then there'll be the robotaxi deal - with every carmaker on the planet using FSD the way laptops license Windows or Chrome, or the way phones license Android.

I really want better proof that my Pfizer jabs are doing what they are supposed to do. Culture wars + biotech business has made it nearly impossible to come up with sound data on whether or not mRNA vaccines are effective against delta. I hope they are, but people in my area are getting infected despite vaccinations while I‚Äôm hitting up brothels and dive bars like it‚Äôs 2019. Israel said Pfizer was not effective, thinking I‚Äôm invisible. UK said 60% of new hospitalizations have had 2 jabs, then retracted the statement the next day w/o providing other satisfactory data.

Solar is already a giant rolling stone. The problem is the scale of land involved, and the change of land use. The energy density - the amount of land required to produce wattage - of PV is relatively low. But, according to the US Department of Energy, to hit the 2035 target of 690 GW capacity of PV, we would need 6,900 to 34,500 sq km.

828,AC," The argument appears to be that it doesn't scale well. Even the highest efficiency solar and wind power are going to take up huge swaths of land to cover the power density of a single nuclear reactor, or equivalent gas/coal plant. Nuclear isn't terribly efficient, but it doesn't need to be in order to feasibly produce enough power. The intermittent nature of solar power means large grids of batteries to store energy, which will take up even more land, along with lots of conversion between AC and DC, which sounds like a small problem until you scale it up. Not to say there aren't solutions for these issues (that's what the engineers are doing), but the environmental impact of covering the energy density and intermittent nature shouldn't be ignored because nuclear power is ""scary"".",ClamPaste,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oovite/prediction_uranium_will_take_over_as_a_dominant/h61mh9d/,0.069,0.819,0.112,0.7355
