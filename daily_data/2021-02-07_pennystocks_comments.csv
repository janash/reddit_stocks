276,DD," Think of it this way.

You have a stock worth .005
That's half a penny per share. 

If that stock moves to be worth a penny, you literally doubled your money. That is great.

The risk comes with how much stock you buy. It's very easy to look at something like that and put 5k and get a million shares. If that share eventually went up to a dollar, you'd be a millionaire. Most hope for that, but typically it moves in tiny amounts, but even a tiny amount can mean significant gains or losses. It's very easy to lose everything if you aren't careful and don't do your DD.

Because of how little a move can mean a huge difference in loss/gain, alot of penny stocks are targets for pump and dumps. The volatility of penny stocks is much greater than the regular market. A penny or two difference in an Amazon stock won't even be noticeable in your portfolio. But in penny stocks it could mean the difference between losing everything or paying off your mortgage. Especially if that stock goes under and never comes back, which happens often to penny stocks. 

The good thing about this sub and others like it, is that it's a community of people who share their DD to help themselves and others. It reduces the risk of buying a bad stock. It doesn't mean you shouldn't do your own DD though, as I've seen many recommendations on here to be refuted with good DD about why it's a bad buy.

The riskiest thing you can do is go ""all in"" on a ""sure thing"". With penny stocks, imo, you want to split your assets between multiple. That way one loss won't be as bad. 

For example, if I have $1000, I'll buy 3-4 penny stocks and put 200-300 in each. Sure I'd have a little FOMO if one takes off and would have tripled my take if I went all in, but a win is a win and the security of having multiple assets give me a lot more peace of mind.

As for holding. It all depends on the stock. If it's a company that has great growth potential and solid numbers, it's typically best to hold. How long is entirely up to you. Gains are gains. This is why DD is extremely important on stocks you are currently invested in. In an instant there could be a huge fraud scandal, the company turns out was cooking the books, it's all over media, and then Bam. The stock tanks back to nothing. 

Some of the most successful companies started out as a penny stock, or at one time was a penny stock. Monster Energy was I believe less than .5 a share when it started. Now it's with $70+-. Amazon started in 1997 as $2 a share. Apple in 2003 was worth under $1 a share. So they most definitely can become big companies. Could you imagine how much money you'd have if you put $1000 into amazon when it was $2 a share?. You'd be a millionaire. Although holding a stock for 24 years is very rare lol.

Simply put, it's too risky for the big guys to risk big money on because they trade in big money. The market is too volatile to be predictable and stable. Larger stocks are much easier to predict and typically hold less losses for larger sums of money if the stock dips, since those stocks typically don't lose 200% of their value just by moving a penny.

RAD received its first SCOT and ROSA orders from a European dealer. A Fortune 100 client bought 5 units from a large dealer. These items were previously announced in a prior press release.

The odds of this stock recovering from this dip are significant, given the positive sentiment around it.

https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/ILUS/profile

I honestly think he should be entirely focused on getting it current, profile updated, and name fully changed. THEN he can worry about acquisition PR's and the like. Would also like to see a website update, but I am willing to give em a pass cause even ALPP had a bad website at the start.

Love when he talks about how well it puts out lithium fires too! 

I live in Japan, and watermist is actually used often here as well!

Here is another video showing FireBug at an exhibition in Dubai more recently (2018)... I like that there are always people in the background of the video... Looks like it was a hit! Guess it must have been since they partnered with Milanion shortly afterwards...

363,DD,"  May I suggest $SING (SinglePoint). This has made a slight run up over the last week, closed at 0.04 on Friday, but in my opinion there is still legs on $SING to run up over the next couple of weeks (current market cap is only about US$50 million).

\- Company's latest presentation can be found here: [https://www.singlepoint.com/downloads/singlepoint-presentation-jan-2021.pdf](https://www.singlepoint.com/downloads/singlepoint-presentation-jan-2021.pdf)

\- Basically, SinglePoint is set up as an investment vehicle, management identifies and acquires companies, recent acquisitions are in the **solar, EV charging and weed sectors**, all of which are good businesses and well-positioned to grow in current general macro and political climates.

\- Latest revenue reported by company has grown significantly (+15% year on year from 9M 2019 to 9M 2020)

\- Company recently removed all convertible notes from its balance sheet, significantly reducing dilution overhang for the stock, benefitting shareholders like us

\- Company's solar installation business appears to be one of the best in town. Gross profit margins on the solar business is \~30%, very much higher than competitors. Large-cap Solar Alliance and SunRun's gross profit margins are at 21% and 23% respectively. Another penny stock $SIRC (which I am also bullish about) has gross profit margins of 26%. $SING's margin's are certainly top notch.

\- Solar's in the trend right now, because of Biden's policy stance. Solar installation businesses will grow very quickly due to increased demand in residential installation. Panel installation businesses such as Solar Alliance, SunRun and $SIRC will continue to grow. So will $SING.

\- From a valuation multiple perspective, these 3 businesses above (Solar Alliance, SunRun and $SIRC) are currently trading at an average of \~45x EV/Revenue. If you apply this 45x multiple on $SING, you can expect at least 30% more upside to the current share price of 0.04. And this 30% upside is not even considering that $SING still has EV Charging and Weed businesses, as well as other future acquisitions!

\- In terms of management team, the team appears to know what they're doing. From its official Twitter account, it announced on Jan 13 that it had entered into a Letter of Intent to acquire EnergyWyze. Just less than a month later, on Feb 3, it announced that the acquisition has been completed. Completing the transaction in such a short span of time points to a highly competent and efficient team which is good news for steering the company forward in their future acquisitions.

\- Near term catalysts: Any new acquisitions announced (very likely due to the fact that the business model of the company is based on new acquisitions and portfolio companies), short term news on EV Charging and Solar industries

You said you don't want to talk politics, so why include this misinformation at all? Oil and gas soared under Obama and the US was almost energy independent under his watch. Trump gutted environmental regs and his tax policy was the icing on the cake. Oil jobs in the US were gutted during the intial COVID spike when prices went negative. You have no idea what will happen under Biden - I suspect we will remain energy independent as we start to lower carbon output over the next decade and jobs will be flat, with explosive growth for renewables.

While these all sound good, what I have no seen is PRT secure a major contract that will boost future revenue.  I think this speaks to the one of the big downsides of the company.  Their MMW products are very disruptive technologies.  Generally, that means that there is a very long initial sales cycle in order to build a track record in industry that allows wider adoption.  I am a little bit skeptical that they can go with the ""groundbreaking idea"" stage to the ""adopted federal standard"" stage in one jump.  I expect that it will be a series of tests, demonstrations, limited pilots, regional implementation, etc. until they are able to make the big jump.

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance and click view all. Check 50/200 MA + Float that the smaller the better and prefer under 100M. Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign. Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%.

Unless ASX decides otherwise, the securities will remain in trading haltuntil the earlier of the commencement of normal trading on Wednesday, 27 January 2021 or when theannouncement is released to the market.

so that is why the chart is so weird and I have a recent update they did acquire broken hills and have entered a binding agreement that will receive approval. Unfortunately I can't copy from my zephyr but I have a screen shot but that wont let me add that either it

I am waiting until it reaches double digits but the reality is, it's a high risk at this point. Like last time there could be a big pullback.

My risk at entering in the $1 range and being patient is very different from someone entering in the $7-8 range. Even in a bad scenario, I will be fine.

FDA could give EUA on phase 3 trials in India. They don‚Äôt necessarily need US trials. 

According to some reports, OCGN is already in talks with FDA. CEO of OCGN has said this and it was reported in a yahoo finance article published on Friday. What ‚Äútalks‚Äù means is vague and speculative at this point.

In terms of price, tomorrow we could see healthy pull back and consolidation, maybe in the $6ish range or as high as $7.20s.

FDA could give EUA on phase 3 trials in India. They don‚Äôt necessarily need US trials. 

According to some reports, OCGN is already in talks with FDA. CEO of OCGN has said this and it was reported in a yahoo finance article published on Friday. What ‚Äútalks‚Äù means is vague and speculative at this point.

In terms of price, tomorrow we could see healthy pull back and consolidation, maybe in the $6ish range or as high as $7.20s.

532,OCGN," Given that OCGN is a high-risk, speculative stock, I am assuming that we will see a big dip tomorrow morning, and the price could normalize once the excitement fades.

Given shortages of the vaccine globally, and the challenges with the existing vaccines that require specialized freezers, it seems that COVAXIN could be a great alternative. COVAXIN can be stored at room temperature.

Children trials are coming up shortly. And phase 3 trials are currently happening. If the trial results are positive, it could lead to a decent gain. I'm also reading that the vaccine was approved for emergency use in India.

Assuming a dip, I am thinking of buying at $3 per share tomorrow morning. And if things go poorly after, I would probably average down and assume a long term position and pray for some good trial outcomes.",csedev,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/less32/ocgn_price_discussion/gmi2by1/,0.036,0.781,0.183,0.9678

547,DD," SIRC still has room to run, good consolidation on Friday. Strong solar play. Announcing an acquisition soon that will give them greater geographic coverage for their service line. 

IQST is a potential hidden gem I'm monitoring - solid fundamentals for a penny stock. Also in a hot industry (5g telecom).  Definately one to track. 

MLFB very hype driven, expecting a steady increase till spring. Not really grounded in fundamentals, but my pick here was based on sentiments analysis. + Football is big and after the pandemic last year I expect more focus in the sporting area this year. 

TMDI robotic surgery is the future. Right there is only one major player and thus the market is essentially monopolized. However, TMDI has a strong product showing with fantastic peer reviews so they stand a good chance to penetrate IMO. Doc's love having new items on the market as it makes tech more cost competitive and helps boost their bottom line.

PVDG good renewables play. Management is very active on social media (check their Twitter). Pivoting into several new promising verticals with acquistions. Plus they have a funny name! 

SOLR.V just announced a share offering not much lower than its current price. I like the management of this company and they have real solid industry connections. May drop a little due to the offering but good OPP to average down/buy in before it (hopefully) rallies. 

SING im banking on riding the solar wave. Some decent upcoming catalysts that can push it up even more. 

INND of course. Lots of DD on this just peruse the forum.

MSNVF/MRS.V incredible fundamentals. Government contract supported revenues. Yeah most of it is from PPE and people think once we're vaccinated (which is gonna take months in a best case scenario) we won't need PPE anymore but I disagree as I believe we have a new normal. 

And finally HITI, another fantastic fundamental penny stock. Cannabis play. Organic expansion and I expect retail to get a boost this year as covid subsides and people just wanna get out and shop.

With pennies, just invest an amount that you‚Äôre comfortable with lighting on fire to get started out on.

Don‚Äôt chase after a breakout (unless you really like the company, but wait to get in after a dip) but most are headed back to pre-breakout prices, or lower.

Buy the rumor, sell the news, if you time em right there are gains to be made. No FOMO!

Don‚Äôt be greedy. Small gains to start.  10% -20% gains is winning.

Most if not all penny investments are built on hope of some catalyst, ie FDA approval. It may never come.  Most likely it‚Äôll never happen. Sometimes, patience can pay off. Dont get caught in a day trade mentality but know when to cut your losses.

There are exceptions to every rule. But don‚Äôt get caught holding bags. Some companies are Pump and dumps and others are the real deal.

BNGO is my exception. I‚Äôm still holding.  There are those few diamonds in the rough that actually have something and it can be a great company in the future. Still, focus on the ‚Äòmay‚Äô and ‚Äòcan‚Äô - nothing is a sure thing.

I love pennies. Price point that you can actually make money if you pick a good one. Enjoy.",justuswendell,19,/r/pennystocks/comments/lemc8l/how_much_of_a_risk_are_penny_stocks/gmfgo12/,0.096,0.718,0.185,0.98

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance and click view all. Check 50/200 MA + Float that the smaller the better and prefer under 100M. Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign. Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day.

570,CEO," Disclosure: no position in afpw, not a chemist, not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice.


I was curious so I did a bit of reading on hydrogen production. Some sources: the patent listing,  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319918321335?casa_token=kWtgg_32WY8AAAAA:TusylxAQXrsNkj8rAud9xNalelif_XmLVYVfT2BJ-HnrmD0rArPImV5GWsSTn4MA_myKSDRmtTM

So long story short I think the hydrogen fuel cell patent aspect of this company is not something that should factor heavily into the outlook. The press release grossly misrepresents what the patent actually is (probably because the CEO doesn't understand it?). There are no specifics on what products etc. this process is being used on, and no indication to me of future growth in hydrogen production for this company. It is also not clear to me that this patent describes state-of-the-art processes, and the wording of the press release indicates to me that the researcher who filed the patent 12 years ago (i.e. the main value creator) is no longer with the company.

The patent itself describes a method of producing hydrogen through electrolysis of water by method of high heat reaction between aluminum, salt, and water. This is cleaner than using methane (assuming the aluminum is recycled or produced green), and provides a better value proposition than using more typical catalysts such as platinum.

However, the patent itself was filed in 2009, and since then more appealing/efficient methods, such as using aluminum nanoparticles, have arisen and become mature (enough for the dod to license the technology).",Banchan000,4,/r/pennystocks/comments/lefpsi/im_surprise_no_one_talked_about_afpwdinatruma/gmecda2/,0.053,0.875,0.072,0.6784
