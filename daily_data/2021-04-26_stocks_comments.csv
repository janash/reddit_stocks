0,CAN," I think the important thing to consider here is the volume you are trading. Also, you need to consider the 'Wash Rule', which I only recently learned about due to that article that hit earlier this year. 

Wash Rule Summary: Any losses you receive on a stock are added to your base price if you buy back into the stock within 30 days. 

Wash Example using 1 share for simplicity: If you have a basis of 100, sell for 90, you have a $10 loss. If you buy back in 29 days later at $80, that $10 loss is added to the $80 cost, meaning your new basis for the share is $90. 

Because this rule, you cannot count that $10 in 'Losses' against your taxes, as it is now part of your new basis for the shares you purchased. 

&#x200B;

Now, if you were to sell 1000 shares at 90, you would have $90k on hand, with a loss of $10k. If you use the $90k to buy 1200 shares ($75/share), you have increased your position by 20%. Your cost basis for the 1200 shares is $83.33 ($100k / 1200 shares). 

&#x200B;

So basically, it CAN be worth it (with large volumes), but may not be once you factor in taxes too. Re-purchasing the shares like this resets your 'Long' position into a 'Short' position, pretty sure anyway. 

If you are doing small volumes, don't waste your time and money unless you somehow anticipate it dropping immensely. As others have said, time in market is better than hoping to time the market.",raunchyfartbomb,27,/r/stocks/comments/myvz3u/should_i_sell_at_a_loss_if_it_means_i_can_rebuy/gvxojcn/,0.024,0.833,0.143,0.982
1,IMO," The best way is to sell out of your position at each period of consolidation. Then buy after the reversal and at each period of consolidation. 

Many on here will say ""just hold the bag"" fucking the worst investment advice ever. So many newbies that have no idea what they are doing and just because the buy and hold strategy worked last year for everybody they think that always happens. 

**Buy and hold is a recipe for losing all your money if you haven't properly hedged or diversified which 90% of these clowns are now thinking ""what is hedging?"" IMO in my opinion you need access to futures to properly hedge.**

2,VERY," Wash sales will bite you if not VERY careful.  In general, if you believe in the stock you hold.  Period.

That way u can buy in cheap and when the people that left re enter the price go up again! This is common in BIO stocks! U can make about 30%+ doing this!

5,BR," Depends on the stock and why is it falling. If you believe it will go up then don't wait it goes lower. Just set yourself limits when do you add more. 

What I personally do is, I wait for 20-30% drop if this happens (example m....med) I sell all so I get back the lost tax I have already paid with some profit taking from other stocks (located in Austria). Then I immediately buy back + invest the returned tax + add some of my funds. 

It works wonders. Managed to Rebuy m..med just before the latest bull run. Already up 100% with the add on part of the holdings. 

Just my tactic.

17,IMO," No, never.

* wash-sale rules
* fee to sell & to-rebuy ($10 here / there adds up)
* loss of time with regards to capital gains
* tax implication

The last two are the most important to me.  If you flip out and into a stock many times, it's a short-term capital gains loss which is realized.  If you know that the stock is going higher than your initial buy-in point (which is why you bought it in the first place) then you are resetting the clock until such a time it becomes a long-term capital gains.

$100 to $90 looks good on paper, but you've just achieved $10/sh loss + fees.  You've also reset the clock by whatever time period you have in order to gain profit on that $90.  Whether it was 2-days or 363-days, your short-term position has changed the time horizon in which you can reduce your tax bill to 20% of your gains (aka, long term capital gains).

The problem is the wash sale like others have mentioned. There is no reason to sell as it dips and buy back in and lose the writeoff of that first dip. 

I fell into a similar trap when I first started and it was because I did no research and was trying to time the market on the AMC memestock stuff.

46,DD," Love this question as that's essentially all that investing is about. To me the price movement each day should not have an effect on your decision to add/subtract to your position unless the movement itself is a symptom of a newly revealed issues with the company.

Presumably once you have decided that a company is undervalued, you want to build a position that you are comfortable with and stop. Some people think that technical analysis can be helpful to find an entry point (I don't subscribe to tech analysis, but to each his own). I myself will build a position immediately if I truly think that a company is undervalued at market price. This is because if the company is truly undervalued, it's statically likely that every passing day gives it a chance to ""revert to the means."" And this seems true btw, for every undervalued stocks I bought, it took about 2-3 quarters or less for the stock to show outsized gains compared to the index. Remember that your time dedicated to do DD about a company is also valuable. Why waste that value on the hope that the stock would fall even further?

So, if the price drops, you want to find out why. Does anything change with the company that affects your DD. If so, maybe the new lower price is justified. If the price goes up, does it have to do with good news that were not part of your original DD. If so, maybe the new higher price is justified. If it's purely market fluctuation or news that is immaterial to company's bottom line (see Intel's ""scandal"" about using weak password), I will ignore.",pml1990,360,/r/stocks/comments/myo8zn/how_do_you_increase_or_decrease_position_in_a/gvw3we0/,0.048,0.776,0.176,0.9899

With the CHPT example, whether you sell, hold or add should be based on whether or not you think it is a good value at its current price, or if you think there are other investments that will provide a better return.  This is true whether you are up 20%, 200% or down 50%.

The other thing you need to consider is the tax implications of selling and short vs long term gains but that is a bigger conversation.",RSBPC,5,/r/stocks/comments/myo8zn/how_do_you_increase_or_decrease_position_in_a/gvwryof/,0.013,0.917,0.07,0.6705
48,CHPT," You need to understand the company, its potential earnings, and decide whether you believe in the stock long term, or if you are following momentum.

CHPT is a company in an expanding market, with the questions being: how expansive? How quickly? 

I read that 80% of EV purchasers will charge their vehicle at home. right now, charging a battery takes 30 minutes at a charging station. There are not a lot of people who like the idea of charging a battery for 30 minutes. Maybe one day in the future (5y?) an 80% charge can be obtained in 10-15min, and maybe the battery range of a car approaches 500mi full charge. If and when such milestones become 1-2 years out, I would find such a company appealing.  The company is not yet profitable. The company's earnings per share do have an appealing trajectory, though its revenue is not dramatically increasing. It will be interesting to see what happens. For example if the Biden administration did pass a bill which provided a great deal of funding for companies like CHPT to set up power charging stations, well, that would be very interesting. On the one hand I don't really think of gas stations as cash cows, but their ridiculous markups for ""convenience"" probably have to bring in a decent profit. 

I would be very interested to see a maintenance costs/sales/profit/competition projection for the company before I would or would not invest.

57,LUMN," > Love this question as that's essentially all that investing is about. To me the price movement each day should not have an effect on your decision to add/subtract to your position unless the movement itself is a symptom of a newly revealed issues with the company.

I disagree. I'd argue the more undervalued you think the company is, you can overweight the stock more in your portfolio. If I think a stock looks promising, but am uncertain about the valuation, I might weight it at <1%. But if it gets cheaper and cheaper and my thesis is unchanged, I might expand to 2%, 3%, 4%, etc. On the contrary, if you think it might start to be getting overvalued, start reducing weight slowly

I did that with LUMN last year/this year. Resulted in buying at $10, but then buying a ton more when it dropped below $9. Then ended up selling most of it at $15 only to buy back in at $12. Then sold at $14 AGAIN and bought back in at $12. Now it's back at $13.

Again, Apple's jump in value after announcing their split ultimately caused me to sell off shares, which I ended up being able to buy back again at a lower price.

Upwork's jump in value caused me to shed half that position which I haven't repurchased so far.

And Tiptree's current jump in value has been one that I think I understand, so rather than selling, I've continued to be a buyer. With that said, even after recent purchases in the $12 and $13 range, my cost is $7.36/share.

My point being, prices go up for different reasons. If, after evaluating all the available reasons for the price increase, it makes sense to you, then no reason to sell, and maybe even buy more. But if it seems like it's run up for no reason except enthusiasm, maybe take some off the table. Again, I know nothing about Calix except the price history that I googled just now.

On the same side of the token, I think EXPE is also undervalued compared to BKNG, especially if they can continue their VRBO rebranding efforts and drive direct traffic (as opposed to Google meta-traffic) at a pace equivalent to ABNB to increase word of mouth and top of mind. Vrbo is their Golden Goose, and they know it.... but they're competing with a 450 pound gorilla who is a household name and whose name has already become a verb (read: direct traffic rather than Google traffic)",AngelaQQ,2,/r/stocks/comments/mytrg0/how_are_you_guys_feeling_about_airbnb/gvxltqr/,0.0,0.941,0.059,0.732

My wife and I have been using Airbnb off and on for vacation travel for a maybe three years. Noticed some changes as it evolves...

* We've been able to stay in some really cool places with ""character"" you don't get from a motel.
* fees (""cleaning"") have gone up on the individual units. More than you'd think just due to pandemic.
* I'm seeing more smaller hotels showing up in the app, maybe fees are better than BKNG/EXPE, or rentals are more successful due to lower competition. It's an interesting development, though.
* regulations will be a headwind, no doubt.
* We have stayed in a number of places where we actually met the owner and in some cases their ability to collect rental income from their property would be near zero if not for Airbnb (or Vrbo). These companies bring a different type of property into the short term rental market.
* I think their successful niche is the space between a night or two in a motel and renting something for a month or more. 
* They're not going to put BKNG/EXPE out of business.
* They've got a business model that started in an underserved market and has the potential to do much more. Depending on how they evolve, things could get very interesting.

101,IMO," Anecdotally, the city of Ottawa just passed regulations on this and told Airbnb to pound sand when they objected. The core of the legislation is that you aren't allowed to get a permit for short-term rental unless the property is your primary residence, if it's a property inside city limits. Essentially kills the entire ""super host"" business model inside city limits. Enforcement starts just under a year from now. Source: [https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/short-term-rental-regulations-committee-ottawa-1.5994594](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/short-term-rental-regulations-committee-ottawa-1.5994594)

As a homeowner who isn't currently speculating or interested in operating an Airbnb, I see this as a net positive for the housing market in Ottawa. It's also highly positive for anyone who is trying to rent in town, which has become ridiculously difficult in the past couple years, and rent prices have been trending upwards even faster than home prices have.

&#x200B;

If more cities sign up for regulations like this, Airbnb is fucked. Short-term rentals have their place, but combined with rampant speculation and investment in urban property it has proven to be fairly unhealthy for housing markets, IMO. Not sure what the exact answer is, and I think the full lockdown on short-term rentals that aren't a primary residence in Ottawa is probably a bit much... but something had to be done about it, and this is what the council went with.",raybond007,16,/r/stocks/comments/mytrg0/how_are_you_guys_feeling_about_airbnb/gvxmg4i/,0.07,0.883,0.048,-0.6997

103,IMO," You can pick but his point, which matches my experience with them lately, is that in a lot of markets for the comparable price of a mid-tier hotel (Sheraton/Hilton/Marriott etc) all that's available is either a room with shared bathroom in someone else's house, or a basement.  Also for short term stays it never makes sense because the cleaning fees are often insane.  

If you're traveling with a group that would otherwise need 3 hotel rooms, and staying somewhere for a week.. Sure, it's a good option to just get a house. 

If you're a couple, or solo, and need to crash somewhere for a night or a weekend, IMO it almost never makes sense anymore.

I will say, this varies a lot based on what market you're in.  For example, US/Canada, I think the above is usually true.

However, with a reasonably strong ETF (like ARKs are, IMHO), I don't see any reason not to hold onto until it goes up unless you need the money now (which it sounds like you don't).

Basically, I think it's going to take a lot longer to recover your losses using an S&P tracking fund than from ARK_. I'm not sure what percentage of your portfolio these make up, but since you say ""only 600,"" I'm guessing it's not a huge share.

Edit:
(BTW, I don't have an answer about the TSLA earnings...I don't follow that stock closely, so not sure how it tends to behave, so I can't really help on if your sold selling now-ish.

ALSO, I just now read your final sentence about not being interested in playing these long. I completely get that...and actually have some ARKK shares I'm deciding what to do with, though they're all positive. I just think it's possible you're going to be paying a significant price for the privilege of not having to look at them in your portfolio each day, which will effectively cancel out the (likely) comparatively small short-term gains from elsewhere in your portfolio.)",t_treesap,2,/r/stocks/comments/mytrt7/rstocks_daily_discussion_monday_apr_26_2021/gvyer8u/,0.114,0.754,0.132,0.7817

296,AMC," Haha just in 2021 I have too many to count already. Some I'm sticking with long-term, others I cut and moved on. My strategy has always been to hold if I genuinely believe in the company long-term, but if I'm holding just due to some emotional ""it's not a loss unless I sell"" bs then I just accept my f\*ck up and cut it and move on. Otherwise imho the opportunity cost is too great - you could be investing that money elsewhere and actually making decent returns.

So anyways, my mistakes of 2021 so far:

**BB** **(cut) -** I admit it, I got caught up in the reddit hype and bought in at $15+. At the time I was justifying it to myself by getting confirmation bias from all the reddit DDs saying they had a huge number of patents, were going to be leading the way in self-driving software etc. But obviously since then it's cratered.

I cashed out at a 40% loss as whilst I don't think this stock will drop much further, equally it doesn't seem like it's going anywhere anytime soon. It's a legacy tech company that is making no money, has a lot of patents but patents are worthless if you can't monetise them, and mediocre leadership (CEO himself was selling stock as the price peaked). So really I think my cash could be invested better elsewhere.

**COIN (holding)** \- bought in at $390 hoping it would spike, of course it didn't. However I bought in more at $300 and am holding long-term, on the basis that at a $100bn valuation this was probably over-valued, but now it's barely worth $50bn which doesn't seem crazy compared to companies like SNOW and even PLTR (more on the latter below). Of course it's very much dependent on the crypto market so is definitely a speculative investment, but I don't think 40-50% gains from here over a few months is unrealistic. I mean their Q1 21 profits were *insane.*

**PLTR (holding) -** bought in at $35, partly because of reddit hype but also because it is a *fantastic* company - Peter Thiel and Alex Karp are veritable genuises, and they really have a huge moat - there is no-one out there who can offer comparable tech currently. Also for all the IT guys on here saying big F500 companies can build their own equivalent software, I would say - have you ever worked for a big corporation? IT always gets the minimum amount possible spent on it (seen as a cost center) and plus data is usually dispersed across numerous legacy databases etc, and nobody has the willingness/skillset to fix it.

Having said that, I acknowledge this is still speculative because of one thing - *valuation.* I love the company, but even I have to admit they are still expensive at $40bn. If the stock price doubled that would make them an $80bn company, which even for an elite data science/machine learning outfit is a pretty pricey valuation (especially given they're not making much in revenue/profits currently).

***AMC (cut)*** \- again bought into the hype, took a big hit but decided to cut and move on. Ok cinemas are reopening, but AMC now has a similar stock price to pre-covid which isn't really justifiable, plus I dont have much faith in the management (CEO paying himself huge bonuses  during the pandemic etc). FYI, for people looking for a better cinema play would check out *Cineworld* (I don't currently hold a position but might do shortly) - listed in the UK but they own cinemas all around the world, particularly in the US. Have a lot of debt so speculative, but their price is still well below pre-covid levels at least.

**TSLA (holding) -** think everyone knows Tesla by now, so no analysis needed here. Bought at the Feb peak but the market crashed, holding long-term though as even though the company is expensive at these levels think they have huge future potential.

It's a legacy tech company that is making no money, has a lot of patents but patents are worthless if you can't monetise them, and mediocre leadership (CEO himself was selling stock as the price peaked). So really I think my cash could be invested better elsewhere.

**COIN (holding)** \- bought in at $390 hoping it would spike, of course it didn't. However I bought in more at $300 and am holding long-term, on the basis that at a $100bn valuation this was probably over-valued, but now it's barely worth $50bn which doesn't seem crazy compared to companies like SNOW and even PLTR (more on the latter below). Of course it's very much dependent on the crypto market so is definitely a speculative investment, but I don't think 40-50% gains from here over a few months is unrealistic. I mean their Q1 21 profits were *insane.*

**PLTR (holding) -** bought in at $35, partly because of reddit hype but also because it is a *fantastic* company - Peter Thiel and Alex Karp are veritable genuises, and they really have a huge moat - there is no-one out there who can offer comparable tech currently. Also for all the IT guys on here saying big F500 companies can build their own equivalent software, I would say - have you ever worked for a big corporation? IT always gets the minimum amount possible spent on it (seen as a cost center) and plus data is usually dispersed across numerous legacy databases etc, and nobody has the willingness/skillset to fix it.

Having said that, I acknowledge this is still speculative because of one thing - *valuation.* I love the company, but even I have to admit they are still expensive at $40bn. If the stock price doubled that would make them an $80bn company, which even for an elite data science/machine learning outfit is a pretty pricey valuation (especially given they're not making much in revenue/profits currently).

***AMC (cut)*** \- again bought into the hype, took a big hit but decided to cut and move on. Ok cinemas are reopening, but AMC now has a similar stock price to pre-covid which isn't really justifiable, plus I dont have much faith in the management (CEO paying himself huge bonuses  during the pandemic etc). FYI, for people looking for a better cinema play would check out *Cineworld* (I don't currently hold a position but might do shortly) - listed in the UK but they own cinemas all around the world, particularly in the US. Have a lot of debt so speculative, but their price is still well below pre-covid levels at least.

**TSLA (holding) -** think everyone knows Tesla by now, so no analysis needed here. Bought at the Feb peak but the market crashed, holding long-term though as even though the company is expensive at these levels think they have huge future potential.

**NIO (holding) -** same as above.",introspective79,2,/r/stocks/comments/mykgkq/wanted_stories_of_bag_holding/gvww9y4/,0.053,0.813,0.133,0.9954

Then you can take a stock like AAPL. I don‚Äôt want to sell AAPL at any price point close to what it is currently. If I sell calls at a very high price way above the current value, I make just pennies per contract. 
Now, in turn for those pennies I am forced to hold the stock - what if a life situation comes up where I need that money and can‚Äôt liquidate ?

What if a massive scandal breaks that AAPL has been cooking their books for years ?

Im interested in CDPR with how beaten down its gotten, but it still has issues that id like to see arguments against.

Like I fully expect a Witcher game to bring people back and money to flow, and that is coming, but that could be 5 years from now. I doubt cyberpunk is currently bringing in a lot of NEW money after the launch, I know the launch was a financial success but its not a game that I think will continue to sell after all the bad PR. Cyberpunk was supposed to have a standalone multiplayer with microtransactions, but earlier this year the CEO said things have changed and they are wanting to simply add multiplayer experiences to their single player games, basically it looks like they are wanting to move away from an almost mmorpg GTA online type of game to a p2p co-op and possibly instanced mode, game wise both are fine, but I dont see how you can monetize the later very well. Also they are actively trying to fix cyberpunk, which means paying employees to fix a product that isnt bringing in new money, its an awkward situation at best.

I see potential for a buyout at some point, but its still too expensive, and the MSFT bethesda deal was a far better value due to all the IP and history. Also with how big CDPR is in Poland, im not sure if the company would sell to foreign company like MSFT or EA

Besides, the multiplayer could potentially flop (see skyrim) or the microtransactions could very well be not well-recieved. Especially, considering their current reputation, microtransactions wouldn't do their public appearence any good.

399,IMO," Just IMO, but I think Covid messed up a ton of the basic indicators and ""guidance"" the market has. Not only because of the huge sell-off in 2020 followed by the insane rise, but especially with the crazy amount of new investors. I believe we are running on a borderline that could go either way, but I wouldn't say this is the same as 2000/2008 simply because the market is not randomly boosted to an exorbitant amount, but these 2 factors played together and caused it.

I think its most likely to see a decline in small cap stocks, a sorting out of growth stocks of those that really have potential and those that just hoped to grow, and a constant gain in big cap stocks, but less than before. If you look at the amount of new people per sub it's mostly the ""affordable"" stocks that got hit by huge increases due to new investors, and I think there will be a big wave where they pull out because they realize small caps and penny stocks are no money printer if you don't exactly know what you are doing.",oodex,3,/r/stocks/comments/myjj1t/which_stocks_will_be_the_safest_from_economic/gvwpnwd/,0.077,0.823,0.1,0.6994

434,SD," I‚Äôve helped teach statistics at the graduate level and have tutored college students professionally. Your question is more or less how to detangle variance and standard deviation.

I‚Äôll keep this simple. I‚Äôm cutting corners on showing all the math. 

Imagine if you had a small array of 5 numbers. The mean of this array was calculated as X (the exact number doesn‚Äôt matter in this example). 
Let‚Äôs determine how far away from the mean each of the 5 numbers in your array are: -3, -1, 0, +1, +3 (pulling this out of the air for example‚Äôs sake). In other words, one of your five numbers is 3 integers below the mean. Another is 1 under. Another is exactly equal to the mean. Another is 1 above. The last is 3 above. If you had to sum the total difference each number in the array was from the mean, you would get zero. Try adding -3, -1, 0, +1, and +3. But how do you show there were difference between each number and the mean? Well...you can square these differences.

So with the example, we can square -3 to get +9. square -1 to get +1. Etc.
If you square the differences between each number in the array from the mean   and add them together (sum of squares), you found the variance. Variance works because numbers squared are always positive. But this number is much larger than what we were dealing with (Again, look at a difference of -3 becoming +9). The variance can be reduced by taking the square root. This is why Standard Deviation is the square root of Variance. This is why we use SD because it sort of recalibrated the scale and numbers used.

456,NAV, So ETFs are fluid and trade throughout the day so there is no premium at the end of the day.  The price of the ETF changes based on the supply demand of the ETF which should theoretically be reflective of the price of the underlying assets (NAV).  If the price strays too far from the NAV there are authorized participants that can create or destroy shares of the ETF by buying or selling shares of the underlying assets in your example bitcorn (which I am assuming is some electronic produce).  So if the ETF is trading higher than the NAV one of the authorized participants can buy the underlying assets and create a new share of the ETF and then sell it to the buyers for a profit instead of selling existing shares (this keeps the price from getting too far above the NAV).  If the price is lower than the NAV they could then sell the underlying asset and destroy shares of the ETF.  This way the outstanding shares of an ETF is not static but the price should stay close to the NAV.,imnotgood42,1,/r/stocks/comments/mz0vbf/can_someone_please_explain_the_mechanics_behind/gvygold/,0.047,0.836,0.118,0.7826
457,VFC," From several sources, the 2 main companies to make the acquisition of Reebok are VF Corp and Anta Sports. VF Corp are more in line with with the brand‚Äôs target market and retaining the individuality of brands - after all Adidas has not proved a successful model of managing Reebok. 

VF Corp has done collabs between Supreme and North Face in the past, to name one, meaning they can elevate Reebok in one collaboration project. Anta Sports are only big in China. VF Corp is big in China too - thanks to Dickies and NorthFace. 

Dickies is making a come back in retail fashion imo. Aside from the practicality it provides in work environments, Dickies - with the quality sourced industrial minimalist style - is becoming ‚Äúcool‚Äù again. 

Cool means you can sell for insane prices because you become culturally relevant and mark a space in time when it was cool, making them commodities too. Take Supreme where white tees with a Supreme logo slapped on the front sell for the north of $3000. 

There‚Äôs good reason to be optimistic of VFC. It provides a good diversity strategy that taps into work/street wear, in a portfolio along with Nike (sportswear), and LVMH (high fashion).",pabloseason,1,/r/stocks/comments/myzkjf/vf_corp_underrated_ticker/gvy3994/,0.027,0.85,0.123,0.9619

My personal qualitative analysis would say Dickies, NorthFace and Reebok are poised for huge growth in the next 5 years. Reebok can emerge out the ashes Adidas put them in - a brand that sponsored NBA throughout the 90s can‚Äôt go that easily into the night. Huge bull on Dickies too.

You have to keep in mind that the Institutions (ie: Hedge Funds) trade against retail traders. A lot of analyst recommendations are just marketing. So you have a stock that looks good to the retailers. That means they want to buy and are willing to buy expensive. So the institutions sell. Which triggers the loss in confidence, analysts changing their mind, retailers selling off their stocks and the price goes down. At which point the institutions buy back the borrowed and sold off shares and voila... they sit pretty.

The thing in the market is that you always have to have someone to trade with / against. If you are buying somebody has to sell and vice versa. And institutions usually hold loads of shares.
