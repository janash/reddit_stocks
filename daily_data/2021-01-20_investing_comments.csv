I think it would be harder to find solid tech B2B businesses that ***aren't*** adopting a moat strategy.

In fact, in some cases, an economic moat can cause growth to stagnate because the business either a) can't innovate fast enough, because a managing a deep moat takes a lot of effort or b) couldn't expand their offering past the moat.

IBM is a great example - great economic moat, but little room for novel growth in the modern tech environment. Their managed infrastructure offering fits all steps that you have provided, but after the spin off of Newco, IBM will pretty much be re-branded red hat+cloud services, since the economic moat of managed infrastructure created too much lag on their leaner product offerings.

Free hydrogen power generated from the elimination of 95% of waste plastic. In an easily scalable and portable system that can even be put on boats to clean the ocean. Honestly it's just sounds too good to be true.  The only competitor seems to be much smaller, based in America and produces oil instead of Hydrogen. 

I managed to get 25k shares at 8p and wish I could get more! Planning to hold for the long term.

The UK government released a document called the white paper in December 20 where they outlined a plan to transition gas suppliers from natural gas to hydrogen as we move towards net zero. 
Initially they are creating a hydrogen powered town and considering blending 20% hydrogen into the existing gas supply. Conventional boilers can only function with this much.

Bosch has already developed a completely hydrogen powered boiler.  Electric heat pumps are slightly more efficient but a hydrogen boiler is a much simpler transition and means we can keep the rest of our existing water based heating systems.  There will also be huge pressure from gas suppliers to stay relevant.

I would wait until you see the LCA from their new ESG committee before you try and claim it's 'net zero energy'. You're pyrolysing/steam cracking plastic to produce it, so no way this is carbon neutral as the 96% of the plastic that doesn't end up as hydrogen is burnt to power the process so ends up as mainly CO2.

The EU has a directive to make all plastic packaging put on the market recyclable in a cost-effective manner by 2030. So that kills the market for technology to deal with unrecyclable plastic. They'd probably do better focusing on emerging markets which have poorer waste management systems and less effective legislation around ensuring producers don't put crap on the market that can't be recycled.",0.079,0.841,0.08,-0.2152
126,UK,"Honest question, where are you finding the statistic for 96% doesn't end up as hydrogen.  Another poster also said only 4% is converted to hydrogen which backs you up. However I can't find it. 

The stats I found were 90% of calorific energy is turned into syngas.  50% of the syngas is hydrogen. Hydrogen is considered net zero as it converts to water when burned. Some of the syngas is used to power the machine. Therefore 50% of the energy to power the machine is theoretically net zero.

Please give me any information you have which says otherwise. I don't want to invest in it if my understanding is wrong!!

I fully agree regarding 100% plastic should be recyclable. Seriously why the hell isn't it.

""Why the optimism? After talking to customers, Auty believes that the majority of them will stick with SolarWinds (ticker: SWI), despite the breach of its IT-management software Orion.

They’re not ignoring what happened. But they do believe that a similar hack could have happened at other companies and they like the fact that SolarWinds’ Orion costs less than the competition.

Auty also points to previous hacks, and the way companies usually managed to bounce back. He estimates that the company will lose 10% of current revenue and that the growth of new business will get “cut in half.”

Auty also trimmed his multiple on SolarWinds to 17 times enterprise value-to-free cash flow to the firm, or EV/FCFF. That’s a discount both to SolarWinds’ average of 19.8 since returning to the public markets in 2018, and to the 25.6 times for “the overall software market.” Auty expects FCFF of $451 million in 2022, giving him a price target of $20 a share for SolarWinds stock, up 37% from Wednesday’s close of $14.64.""

This is actually in line with what I've seen on my end. People are annoyed at SolarWinds for the trouble caused and management is scared of negative press, but nobody is actually swapping out SolarWinds for other products because they are just cost effective. It's business, plain and simple.

Assuming that the company is mature with zero growth prospects (and zero decline risk), personally I would like it to take around 10 years. The market seemed to have also arrived at a similar agreement that it should be about 10-12 years which is why the mature companies rarely have PE above 15 in a non frothy market.

To take this further, I continue to use similar ratios to assess growth companies.
