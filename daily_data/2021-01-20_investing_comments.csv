I think it would be harder to find solid tech B2B businesses that ***aren't*** adopting a moat strategy.

In fact, in some cases, an economic moat can cause growth to stagnate because the business either a) can't innovate fast enough, because a managing a deep moat takes a lot of effort or b) couldn't expand their offering past the moat.

IBM is a great example - great economic moat, but little room for novel growth in the modern tech environment. Their managed infrastructure offering fits all steps that you have provided, but after the spin off of Newco, IBM will pretty much be re-branded red hat+cloud services, since the economic moat of managed infrastructure created too much lag on their leaner product offerings.

If it's a bear market, then I would say move your money/investments into a non-bear market (move money out of Japan after 1980 and put it into China/US).

People have said that in runs past gold would be a good hedge against cash in case of a economic collapse. I also thought this was the truth and thought it would be a hedge and safe haven (didn't buy any though). 1600-1500-1600-1400. This time around gold really didn't rise when the market tanked. It also shit the bed, but it shit the bed less. Post-market gold boom wasn't due to gold itself but worldwide central bank printing.

So GOLD did better than most of the market, but the FAANGs were about that resilient too (I was hoping to get in at a lower price but they never really dipped to a price I liked).

If everything falls, then it means that the dollar is strong. Holding bonds is just dollars with interest. Remember that while you can cash your bonds with the bond issuer early, you can always SELL your bond on the market for cash.

Trade Desk's Jeff Green on the last Trade Desk conference call in November regarding this:

""Awesome. I'll take the first one and then Blake, if you want to take the lead on the second one, that'd be great. So, first, I'd like to answer the Apple IDFA question in two ways. First, let me just talk about from our company perspective, and then I just want to talk about it on behalf of the Open Internet and bigger perspective.

So, about 10% of our spend uses IDFA, and because we've had limited targeting on that 10% for quite a long time continuing to limit it or limited in a new way, doesn't have a material impact to our business. Because we're looking at roughly 12 million ads every single second, when you take a million-ish of those and say, we're going to allow less data to be used on those. We just look more carefully for gems and the other 11 million. So, I don't expect it to have a material impact on our business the way that it will others.

So, when you hear Facebook talk about having a big impact, just remember they're 70%-ish mobile, not 10% IDFA so, very different impact to us. That said, **I do believe this is Apple trying to mess with Facebook's business and Google's business. They're much more committed, I think, to payment than they are to the advertising ecosystem.**

But one thing I just think has not been talked about enough is that when you limit the ability to use IDFA by all apps, not just for advertising, but for personalization, like in Netflix or Dropbox or so many others, what that is going to lead to is a massively deprecated consumer experience where consumers are then going to be asked the question, if you would like to upgrade your experience, you have to go to settings and change the following. I believe that that is inevitable, that because there's so much advantage to that personalization and there's so many companies that are committed to doing that in a fair, equitable, responsible way, including us.

I believe we've already been through this with location on Apple, and it ended up people giving consent in the places that mattered so that they could have a better experience. I think long-term, we end up with people opting into IDFA and this not being a big setback for the industry of personalization. I don't expect that to happen. But I'll just go back to -- as it relates to us, it's a small portion of our business, given our focus on connected TV and being a gateway to all channels, not just one.""

It's important to reassess your stocks every once and a while. When you do and you see an opportunity to add then do so. 

Another opportunity is when a quality company dips because of short-term issues but it's fundamentals are strong. I bought BABA during IPO at $90ish. Picked up more when it dipped 2015-16. Picked up more when it rallied to $160+. Was thinking of selling some on Ant IPO, but didn't get to. Saw shit hit the fan, but from my personal understanding of China and BABA lead me to believe that it wasn't catastrophic so I bought some at $260. It dipped more so I bought even more at $220 range. Then it when back up until Trump started talking b.s. and it dipped to $220 again where I bought even more.

""Why the optimism? After talking to customers, Auty believes that the majority of them will stick with SolarWinds (ticker: SWI), despite the breach of its IT-management software Orion.

They’re not ignoring what happened. But they do believe that a similar hack could have happened at other companies and they like the fact that SolarWinds’ Orion costs less than the competition.

Auty also points to previous hacks, and the way companies usually managed to bounce back. He estimates that the company will lose 10% of current revenue and that the growth of new business will get “cut in half.”

Auty also trimmed his multiple on SolarWinds to 17 times enterprise value-to-free cash flow to the firm, or EV/FCFF. That’s a discount both to SolarWinds’ average of 19.8 since returning to the public markets in 2018, and to the 25.6 times for “the overall software market.” Auty expects FCFF of $451 million in 2022, giving him a price target of $20 a share for SolarWinds stock, up 37% from Wednesday’s close of $14.64.""

This is actually in line with what I've seen on my end. People are annoyed at SolarWinds for the trouble caused and management is scared of negative press, but nobody is actually swapping out SolarWinds for other products because they are just cost effective. It's business, plain and simple.

Also, SolarWinds beefed up their security quite a bit with some recent high profile hires + the recent news, so there isn't even enough time to swap out SolarWinds before people stop thinking of the hack.",0.047,0.886,0.067,0.6574

So you can ask yourself, if you were to invest $1000 in a company, what would be a reasonable number of years you would wait for the profits to cover that investment? Assuming that the company is mature with zero growth prospects (and zero decline risk), personally I would like it to take around 10 years. The market seemed to have also arrived at a similar agreement that it should be about 10-12 years which is why the mature companies rarely have PE above 15 in a non frothy market.

To take this further, I continue to use similar ratios to assess growth companies. I project earnings growth over 10 years (yes this involves looking at tea leaves to some extent) and then discount and calculate the forward P/E.

Not to mention BrainChip trades OTC here, but it is listed on the ASX, which is much more heavily regulated, so personally I see the stock as less risky because it has at least cleared the minimum requirements of the ASX.

While BrainChip shares are measured in pennies, their market cap is nearing a billion (which is larger than many companies Cathie already holds like SYRS, ONVO and EXPC) so I thought it plausible that BrainChip might not be ruled out due to its' size.

Besides, I was at a school that has started a space program.

221,ACA,"I would think it's not about salary here.  It would be about how much you get in long term capital gains each year.  This would mean that, independent of salary, if you got more than $1 million a year in long term capital gains, the excess of that $1 million would be taxed at a higher level.  

My understanding is that US federal long term capital gains currently have 3 separate brackets: 0%, 15%, and 20%.  Biden's proposal is to introduce a 4'th bracket at 39.6%.  (This is in addition to the ACA tax, which is applied to total income.  It's a 3.8% tax of everything above a certain level.  But, to my knowledge, that number isn't changing.) 

Note: while I'm pretty sure I'm correct in my details, please don't take a random internet person's knowledge as fact when assessing your own tax liabilities.",0.012,0.863,0.125,0.9274
