In the eco system of crypto, Bitcoin is the one asset every coin can be converted to and from. These Altcoins as they’re currently called will revolutionize how we store value (not just monetary). Central Bank Digital Currency, Digital Yuan, and Digital Euro will also be able to convert to and from Bitcoin.

Gold has use cases for RL, but compared to Bitcoin it will have no use case for the internet. Gold is a tool of rulers in which one must trust. Bitcoin is a tool of rules in which trust is obsolete.

59,ACA,"Well, if that's their goal they might want to rethink their ACA subsidies.  Right now they're best suited to people doing exactly that - bronze plans work far better for somebody with $1M in a brokerage account and $30k/yr in AGI than for the people working 35hrs/wk for minimum wage without employer-based coverage.

If anything it might discourage over-saving.  If you just save $1M chances are that even with annualized taxation of gains you're still going to be close to 0% - the taxes only become an issue if you decide to save up more as an insurance policy so that you're less likely to end up needing the state to bail you out later in life.  :)",0.021,0.796,0.183,0.9601

I've been trying to buy AMD chips and laptops for months, with no luck. Laptop makers aren't developing nearly as many nor as good laptops with AMD, simply due to lack of availabilty of chips.

71,AMD,"I agree, AMD is grossly undervalued at $90 if you're looking at the future. Investors may want some return on their investment now though, and it may not go up right away but it eventually will I think.

People are quick to point to PE ratio and Intel switching CEOs, so I'll try to tackle this slowly.

Intel: This is a dinasour. I've said it a million times now. A new CEO is not going to solve the issues magically, and certainly not tomorrow. He used to work at Intel, and he worked at VM (Think Dell level kind of investment) IMO, that isn't a proven record to push Intel out of its problems. The main problem here is a scared cornered board of directors has to act and put this guy in. They're not acting out of innovation, their culture is still toxic, and they still lack talent.

PE ratio: The current one isn't accurate. They bought Xiling, you need to add that in. Regardless though, you're buying into the future of the company. They have the best hardware AND software. They're competing with two different companies, Nvidia and Intel. People are quick to compare them to only Intel, but forget they make a wide range of products to compete with both. Their CPUs are rolling out in a lot of new laptops, count that in too. People talked about PE when AMD was $30, $50, $70, and now $90.

Personally, I'm investing in Lisa Su's leadership, their talent, company culture, and an excellent eye for the future. $120 - $180 is my price target.

214,AMD,"AMD used to have a reputation as the frugal alternative. However, now that they have taken the performance crown their pricing model shows they have abandoned that approach. In regards to overall value, all intel needs to do is adjust their pricing and they can match or surpass AMD's value. Of course AMD can do the same but I dont think AMD will do that because they are now the ones in power to be the price setter. Before AMD would let intel set their prices and then slot their cpus a bit lower to give themselves that frugal attractiveness. The tables have turned and Intel is doing that now. More cores also dont really matter when the vast majority only need 4 to 8 cores. The largest market share is in the mid range, not the top end. On laptops TDP affects battery life so that's why it really matters. On desktop ther is no battery life concern. The other big area where power draw matters is servers which i dont think rocket lake and zen3 are marketed for. Most desktop DIY or prebuilt consumers dont even know what their cpu TDP is. The only real attractive feature AMD has is that their CPUs can work with multigenerational chipsets (also important to point out AMD motherboards tend to be cheaper which adds to their value but again, intel just needs to adjust their price to nullify this advantage). Actually at this time the real determining factor is which CPU is in stock. The biggest bottleneck to revenue and profit for both companies at this time is really who has access to fabs. At least until this craze for computer parts dies down.

That's not due to any inherent advantage of the instruction set, it's just that a lot of high performance software was originally designed for x86 and that's where emulation tends to be the most noticeable and least efficient.

Modern x86 CPUs are mostly a RISC core with an X86 frontend (and extended registers to support SSE/AVX). That's part of why AAPL's emulation is so much better than any other attempts, they implemented some of this translation in hardware without carrying a bunch of unnecessary legacy support that can be replicated in software.

x86's main advantage was lower memory usage and simpler compilation because complex multi-part operations were just recognized by hardware.

A programmer once explained to me that back in the days, when RAM memory was an issue with most computers having like 4 MB or RAM, code produced was extremly focussed on being RAM efficient.  When RAM price and quantity started to get better and better, programmers became kinda lazy about it because bad code who takes too much RAM is fixed by simply popping in more cheap RAM.

I don't think AMD has any chance of conquering the server market, but they have plenty of room to grow in that space before running out of steam. Personally, I'm expecting AMD's growth within the desktop market to flatten out soon, but for their laptop and server share to grow sharply over the next year.

Facebook: The Whatsapp thing is the last of a huge amount of pressure they're having from government institutions. I think 2021 might finally be the year they're going to be broken apart. The platform is also completely redundant and uncool (C)

Apple: their strongest point being brand affection and positioning has started fading. They're not innovating and rising prices, people are catching up to it. Entering EV it's a question mark but can make them or break them. (B-)

Amazon: killing it with what they're doing in the software space more and have a massive cash cow business. The amount of things they're adding to AWS is absolutely crazy and really strong, plus, they keep giving credits to startups to use their stuff. (A-)

Microsoft: Boomer company. Lost all innovation. They had a 15 years head start on Zoom with Skype and yet managed to fail. They had a 20 years head start on Android and yet managed to fail. Sitting on a cash cow. Will die in a decade. (C-)

Google:  Still believe in them. True that they're trying and failing a lot but that only means they're still innovating a lot. I think they're missing a lot by not entering the Ed-Tech space. After this virus everyone has started realising University at 100K per year gets stripped away of its value. Which is not the education but networking. They can start certified bootcamps and fill the gap universities are creating. (A-)

Their products are always market leaders, they can arrive with less specs but performance will be better. No one is threatening their space at the moment, tablets? It’s iPads vs no one.

Messaging apps are a dime a dozen, if you’re gonna load it with ads or start stealing my data I’ll go elsewhere. Just wait until the iOS update comes out where people have to allow Facebook to steal your data before you use their apps, let’s see just how many people start leaving. There’s a good reason Facebook took out multiple full page ads trying to attack apple over it.

And that leads into Apples other area they are owning. Privacy. Google and Facebook are the opposite and Apple are giving people exactly what they want.

- very diverse revenue streams (Office, XBox, LinkedIn, Azure) each of which has limited competitors

- management is good at deploying capital, which shows up in high ROE/ROIC %. One risk in big companies is that the managers go off on empire-building sprees and do crappy acquisitions that destroy value, I trust MSFT leadership enough to not do that

- Risk of overpaying: the P/E ratio is above average historically for MSFT right now, but relative to the market it's pretty fairly priced. Also, looking at EPS growth over time, it appears MSFT is growing earnings at a faster-than-usual rate the past several years - which helps justify that valuation.

- The stock price has been trading sideways for the past 6 months after a big run-up. This is not uncommon, in fact a good sign if you're thinking of buying now, that earnings have had a chance to catch up again after the big rise in 2020.

>Most large businesses use SAP or its closest competitor, Oracle, and SMBs also rely on SAP software; 80 percent of SAP’s customer base is made up of small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), a surprising number given the company’s reputation for powering some of the world’s largest multinationals.

And guess what integrates with SAP (and Oracle)?  Microsoft products. In fact last I checked, SAP's software only runs on Windows. So any company using SAP at bare minimum needs Windows just to manage it...and if they are planning to use it for anything they need Microsoft products (Excel is a big one since it can link directly into SAP and many companies use Microsoft SQL Server as the data backend for SAP, and they use Power BI for analysis on that data...).

450,HEXO,"As a Canadian consumer of a variety of products, hard disagree. 

I think people are just assuming that intoxicants are interchangeable without even testing the products first. 

Consumable cannabis (as compared to inhalable) has a much more delayed effect and as a result isn't an effective replacement for the social lubrication provided by a glass of wine. After going to a number of social events post-legalization, I've found it has the opposite effect more often than not (making the high consumer more spaced out and challenging for a sober or drunk person to interact with). There's opportunities to innovate, but I haven't seen it, and more than a few startups are trying to drum up a consumables market without much success. 

What cannabis does have the potential to be is a great 'unwind after a long day' kind of beverage, and a therapeutic for people who don't like standard pharmacological solutions for pain, insomnia, or anxiety. For the average person who didn't consume often pre-legalization, I believe cannabis products are much more likely to end up in their medicine cabinet replacing Advil/Ambien/Robax rather than in their fridge replacing alcohol. There's obviously a recreational market, but I think it's pretty well defined already (ie the delta between pre- and post-legalization is not that wide) and extremely vulnerable to cigarette companies as others have already mentioned.

I've tried loading up with edibles with a couple friends before parties and while it did make us feel happier, it made a few of us feel self-conscious and more reserved.

For the same reason, I think anyone banking on there being a big recreational market of new cannabis consumers post-legalization is going to be disappointed. I think most people who want to use cannabis recreationally are probably doing it already, as the illegal and pseudolegal avenues for getting pot are pretty simple to find and use.

464,MLP,"Looking for some guidance on my situation.

My brief background:

Im a 32 years old American citizen living abroad in Japan. I currently make $50-55k a year, depending on the amount of my bonus and the current exchange rate.

My current financials are:

~$15k I have on hand that Im looking to invest.

~$30k I have invested in a Steelpath MLP fund that Im willing to pull out and reinvest elsewhere if it seems advisable. 

For this fund, I made my initial investment when I was younger and for the longest time it was selling at lower than I bought it, but now after all this time its finally at a point where I could pull out now and break even. This fund is related to oil pipelines like the one in Alaska Biden has announced hes going to revoke the permit for, which tells me things are going to go south for it soon and if I want to pull out now is time to do so. Also this fund never really sat well with me ethically but it is what it is. The reason I stuck with it is because it does indeed pay high dividends, I currently make about $280 a month from this fund which Ive so far been reinvesting but planned on cashing in on in the future if it ever got to around $500 a month. Part of me does want to stick with it for the dividends but if anyone has insight on how that $30k could be better invested I would love to hear it!

Due to my currrent living situation Im rather limited in what I can invest in (No Roth IRAs :( ) from the research Ive done, it seems like my best potential investment choices are ETFs and cryptocurrency.

I have very little knowledge and absolutely no training or education with investing beyond what ive managed to teach myself but after reading articles and watching hours of youtube explaining the basics Im finally at the point where I can put in some money without feeling totally clueless.

My plan was to first spend $10k spread out over 4 months or so using the dollar cost average method on ETFs and see how that goes.

Bitcoin also looks very appealing at the moment but I keep flip flopping between thinking Im already too late and should wait for a major crash or that now may be my last chance to get in before it skyrockets any higher.

If anyone has any advice on what they would do in my situation, it would be greatly appreciated!",0.05,0.861,0.089,0.9656

509,VIE,"To my knowledge, there has never been a Chinese company which are all structured as a VIE where the contract between the company and the vie entity being arbitrarily dissolved. 

Generally speaking - when you invest in a company, you are placing faith in capitalism and the notion that the contractual agreements cannot be arbitrarily broken. Even when you buy shares in a stock with a brokerage, you don't directly own the stock and it's held in street name. And there are other structures like ADRs, unit trusts, etc where you don't directly own the shares. There are obviously big differences but much of the capital markets are bound by contractual agreements and the risk of VIEs are more about how strong those structures are in protecting the investor. I don't know that answer because VIEs are being used by Chinese companies as a work-around to Chinese law. 

If you think about a company like Alibaba - there is really no good reason for the management to ""shut it down"" as you put it. It would set a terrible precedent and it would further restrict access to the capital markets for Chinese companies. The only reason why a vie is being used is because of Chinese law that doesn't allow for direct foreign investment - which in itself is somewhat weird because Chinese regulators have signaled as recently as last year that China wants to participate in the global capital markets. I suspect that it's mostly just bureaucracy and politics that are slowing down Chinese regulators.

I managed to get 25k shares at 8p and wish I could get more! Planning to hold for the long term.

The UK government released a document called the white paper in December 20 where they outlined a plan to transition gas suppliers from natural gas to hydrogen as we move towards net zero. 
Initially they are creating a hydrogen powered town and considering blending 20% hydrogen into the existing gas supply. Conventional boilers can only function with this much.

Bosch has already developed a completely hydrogen powered boiler.  Electric heat pumps are slightly more efficient but a hydrogen boiler is a much simpler transition and means we can keep the rest of our existing water based heating systems.

Acti-blizz also have very little respect from their customers, and have made terrible decisions affecting the quality of their games. Yes, their financials are solid because the monetisation for their games has been heavily reworked in recent years, with a lot of paid cosmetic content, but its a known fact that wow just came out of arguably the worst expansion in the games history, and personally I think if it wasn't for the loyalty of their customers the game would still continue to hemorrhage subscribers. I mean the CEO of acti blizz is on record saying that they wanted to take the fun out of games development.

577,IMO,"IMO you need to move away from the big dick swingers in the gaming industry. They are maxed out - the room for growth is minimal. Every turn at lootboxing, card sharking, etc. has been done. The consumers, organisations and even countries are starting to lash back. 

There is much more growth possibilities in mid-level companies. Look up Embracer Group (prior name THQ Nordic) and Paradox Interactive Inc. Check up Unity, Capcom, Gravity and Kahoot.
 
These companies are still undervalued compared to the clout they own, the IP's, resources and good will that they retain. Lots of growth potential, especially in Kahoot.",0.043,0.861,0.097,0.7184
