0,MLM," This is going to be a major fucking mess, especially if businesses are FORCED to accept BTC as currency, unless it's just cleared and converted to cash immediately. Even then, will be a huge headache.

1. BTC obviously way too volatile at this moment
2. Transaction costs are still very significant
3. Is more of a gimmick. Those that own BTC arent owning it because they want to use it as a currency. They own it because they want to get rich

10,GDP," I should also add to that since so many are unbanked crypto is actually great because you can send payments peer to peer and across distances. The reason I mention distance is because something like 20% of the GDP of El Salvador is remittance from migrant workers elsewhere and it often can takes days and large fees (like 10%) to send that money back to El Salvador. Crypto alleviates having to send thru a traditional institution and allows you to send directly to someone back home via their wallet address.

14,ALL," They do for a country that needs to raise an army and all of that. Especially when practically every country in the world has a similar strategy/behavior in monetary policy. The world did use Gold/Silver and it worked because Gold/Silver was generally seen as a global standard during those millennias  of our history. Establishing fiat currency is a way to leverage over other countries, which is why trying to use gold as the standard for a country's currency would probably just lead to war. HOWEVER, not so much if all countries agreed to ALL use the same deflationary currency globally.

16,USA," Look reading through your comment/post history, we have a lot more in common than you think. I think it's sort of sad that you think attacking my identity (which is 1st gen Hispanic) somehow undermines the validity of what I have to say. I have family in Latin America, they're poor, some have gotten mixed up with really awful things and for the most part, they are stuck: no upward mobility.

I actually do believe that class divisions between rich vs poor have a lot more to do with problems in the US/Latin America than race. I just happen to believe that White Supremacy, Blood Quantum, and other Eugenics pseudo-science created very real socio-economic racial divisions when it was used as a justification post-colonization for why everyone who isn't white should be disenfranchised in almost every way possible. Those divisions created real lasting effects that are seen today, my family fled Latin America because of it and now I'm seeing it today in the USA.

Problem with talking about class is that in all my years of trying to get friends, family to talk about it, it doesn't work. People get uncomfortable talking about class, even more so than race because it inevitably brings up the topic of redistribution of wealth and no body wants to give up what they have so that the have-nots can have more.

19,OAS," I'm from El Salvador, and this could be nothing but a lie. Yes, a lot of people receive remittances, but transmitting dollars doesn't cost 50% in fees. If you're sending money from the US to here, you barely pay normal western Union fees, which are like $8 for every $100. People over here are not educated enough to know the risks this move implies for our population. 

Currently, this idiot cut ties with OAS and is looking to cut ties with the US and have China as our main economic partner, just as Nicaragua did (take a look at their economy and see how they're doing). This is a disaster, uneducated population taking on high risk speculation, while cutting ties with the country that supplies 80% of our oil, for one that enslaves its people.

This move will basically make El Salvador safe haven for the corrupt ones in the world because it wouldn't be possible to trace their stolen money to have them accountable for something. By cutting ties with OAS, we're becoming a no-extradition country.

20,USA," No need to apologize, I enjoyed reading through your other posts/comments and realized you have a perspective that I lack. I also realize that I have been guilty of the following, despite being a 1st-gen (Spanish as a first language) Hispanic, and I really meant no disrespect.

>when foreigners (gringos in particular unfortunately) try to force the context of their society onto these issues and use their global cultural influence to change the framework of the debate.

In some ways I feel like I don't have a US-centric view of the world because there is so much I disagree with my American peers about, especially about Latin America and world affairs. It's hard to recognize your own biases towards a topic when you have nobody to point them out to you, so thank you for doing so. I also see how changing the framework of the debate can be incredibly damaging, I experienced that first hand in the USA when our national discourse and academic circles shifted in the early 2010's from a focus on class inequality to identity politics. It honestly disillusioned me and I left behind a career in economic legislation because of it.

If you could recommend any books or publications that could help me understand the history of  Latin American then I would be open to reading them. I read Che Guevara's Motorcycle Diaries in Spanish as a teen and it changed my life. My parents are now quite out of touch with Latin America and in many ways bitter and cynical about the fate of Latin America because of their experiences, I guess it comes as no surprise that I have taken on that view, regrettably.",Wulfkine,1,/r/investing/comments/nt5qgg/el_salvador_looks_to_become_the_worlds_first/h0rfxd5/,0.117,0.802,0.081,-0.8608

25,DCF," Exactly this. I always find it so strange when retail investors talk about how they aren't into something because the liquidity is too low and then wonder why their amazing value picks aren't as undervalued as they thought. In an age where information is everywhere and securities are pushed through marketing campaigns etc. by hedges and the like it's not surprising that the value premium has been essentially non existent for years. This is why there is such a push I think into DCF models and other methods of projecting growth, rather than finding companies that are truely and actually undervalued today.

It seems there is this fear that people won't be able to exit positions when in reality if you find an undervalued stock in the micro, nano, or small caps with low liquidity (this is where they mostly exist) and are able to build a position over a few days/weeks/months when the security does begin correcting back to its intrinsic value people notice and the liquidity increases. The other reason why I mentioned nano and micro caps is these are areas of the market where generally the big players have too much money to invest here in any meaningful way so it leaves many undervalued plays totally available to the average retail investor, so yes illiquid stocks in the larger caps are a dangerous game for small timers but if you play where the big guys can't you can really capitalize on this inefficiency.

26,GME," Naked shorting during times of high demand artificially suppresses price discovery in the name of stability. In that period, the true price was actually elevated, but naked shorting prohibits natural price action. For a wild example, GME at the end of January, the participants were willing to pay on excess of 500/share, so that's what it's true price was. In this specific example, I would argue the conditions that created this as a possibility were also a result of naked shorting. Exchanges reported short interest in GME in excess of it's actual shares that existed - not just the float. If these conditions are not permitted to exist, situations like meme stock runs would be exceedingly rare. They are now common, and will remain a part of our market until something is done about sacrificing all other factors in the name of liquidity and enriching market makers with high volume spread-scalping.",Ms_Pacman202,11,/r/investing/comments/ntgmks/why_is_having_liquidity_in_markets_considered/h0snltl/,0.037,0.832,0.132,0.9473

34,IMO," Market makers do dodgy things but not around short selling.

Generally they get in trouble for poor order routing/execution, delayed execution and/or misleading quotes.

These are all bad and market makers have been punished for these but these all landed in grey areas of the financial securities regulation and risk/reward is was probably worth it for them to try bend the rules. It's highly unlikely much of this behaviour persists though after cases were settled against Nasdaq market makers in ~2000 ensuring there is more stringent regulations around these areas.

Instead most of the dodgy stuff has moved up to the broker <-> MM interactions. Brokers like Robinhood sell your order flow to MMs for preferential execution.

Wall Street is massively underweight China right now but that position can't last forever and they won't want to miss out once it starts moving again.

We are also seeing signs that China hardline stance is softening with Trump out of power now. Hardline politics makes Wall Street very uncomfortable because it greatly increases uncertainty.
China transitioned into a hardline strategy when Trump took office as Trump destroyed his state department and greatly weakened American influence abroad, especially around Asia.
Taking the hardline stance allowed China to make very aggressive moves in Southeast Asia while America was asleep at the wheel.
With Biden back in power and the slow restoration of a competent state department China is changing tact and going for a softer diplomacy stance especially with neighbors like the Philipines, Thailand etc.

This doesn't mean America and China are going to become friends, -far- from it, if anything competition will escalate. It will however normalize the situation and remove a ton of uncertainty about how far China is willing to go on certain issues like the South China Sea and Taiwan.

I want to have both sources of income so I can use the tax brackets to my advantage in retirement.

Can also change to a no income tax state in retirement and benefit both on roth conversions or just on withdrawing that pretax income.

71,HNW," When Roth accounts first became available, they were regarded as an oddity. The Roth IRA in particular was often viewed as a benefit for lower wage earners, with much incorrect and complicated advice given on supposed implied requirements for backdoor Roth contributions in particular. 

These days, many retirement planning experts, e.g. Suze Roman, advocate contributing to Roth accounts as much as possible. That's because they're simply the most flexible, advantageous option. **It's actually a no-brainer to choose the Roth for high earners in particular.**

1. You can effectively contribute more earnings per year with the Roth account types when maxing out, since the contribution limits are the same but it's post-tax money. (Tax brackets aside, this is why you seem to have more disposable income when contributing the same number of dollars to traditional accounts--*you're saving less*.)

2. For those lucky but increasing few who can make additional after-tax contributions, the mega backdoor Roth can shelter all of that money and earnings forever, whereas the traditional IRA obviously provides zero benefit. 

3. Those who save much more for retirement will be in higher tax brackets after retirement if the money's not sheltered, exposing high earners to more risk if (when) tax hikes eventually come. And no one knows the future, including whether HNW individuals will even have a standard deduction available.

4. There are many other Roth benefits. When leaving retirement funds as a legacy, they won't even be taxable then; there are no RMDs with Roth IRAs;  all contributions can be withdrawn tax free during a rainy day; etc.

5. Barring mega backdoor conversions, 401k rollovers are the quickest way to increase contributions to the all-important Roth IRA, and most people only get the chance for this when changing employment. In fact, keeping money in traditional accounts can complicate Roth conversions due to the [**pro rata rule**](https://www.fulltimefinance.com/pro-rata-and-discrimination-tests/).

For a high earner, the single case in which traditional retirement accounts can make more sense is for those who don't plan to save much for retirement, meaning that despite much higher available cash during working years they plan to live on relatively very little in retirement--that is, folks planning to explicitly fail by most metrics in the retirement planning industry.",jeff_varszegi,0,/r/investing/comments/ntb8pa/why_would_anyone_ever_choose_a_traditional_401k/h0saujn/,0.041,0.857,0.102,0.9726
72,EARN," yours is the closest answer to correct

people keep saying 'will you make more in retirement', as a way to choose roth and tIRA and that is fundamentally incorrect

you don't EARN anything in retirement, that's the point

your income should even out your expenses, period

I'd even go one step further and say a standard brokerage is a better investment than a Roth, you cna touch it whenever you want, harvest tax losses, and in retirement, pretty much acts no different than a roth (up to certain amounts)

to compound on your answer, you deduct 401k up to 25k, 0%

can take from brokerage up to 85k in GAINS, 0%

and if that's not enough, you JUST are now hitting the 10% bracket

so you'd be hard pressed to even push a 5% effective tax rate with little to no effort

try doing that in your earning years and you'll see what tax deferred comes out ahead

sure, no one knows the future tax rates, but they would really have to make the bottom end significantly higher, and all signs point to them pushing the higher end up, which you'd never see in retirement",datrumole,2,/r/investing/comments/ntb8pa/why_would_anyone_ever_choose_a_traditional_401k/h0th3om/,0.04,0.896,0.063,0.5476

93,IMO," My take is that all investment is at huge risk right now. Inflation is on the minds of many investors, who have sought to invest in commodities, equities, crypto etc. That's a logical move. If your dollar will be worth less, invest in something less prone to inflation. Here's the bug. With many investments like stock and crypto at much higher prices than last year, there's also a risk that investors walk off with their gains. I mean, even if the dollar is going to inflate 10% overnight, at some point it makes sense to walk off with my 20% gains and re-enter the market after it tanks. It's all psychology. Everything could stay up forever, or it could come crashing down tomorrow. There's just no sure bets right now. If it's a good inflation hedge, it's currently either overbought, or it's underperforming for what you'd expect, like gold, and you wonder if it's going the way of the dinosaurs. Bonds are shit. 

Personally, I'm thinking more about dividend paying value stocks that don't like to move much, because I anticipate those will be safer than other areas. VIG is a solid ETF for a time like this, IMO. It's large cap companies that have consistently increased dividends for the past ten years. It's boring, but it's also not a bubble that's as likely to burst as other arenas. It's Walmart and Microsoft and stuff like that. Recently oil has treated me well, but I sold about half this week because I see that as short term cyclical stuff rather than a safe bet for the next year or so. I hit my target on several plays there and backed out a little. Still holding a good chunk of Diamondback Energy. The more I learn about that company, the more I like it. Also a good dividend play. Crypto is good, too, but I think scalable altcoins are a better pick than bitcoin. We;re very possibly just at the start of a big altcoin season, if crypto in general doesn't turn bearish. 

But again, my overall point here is, if I'm buying stocks and cryptos because I'm worried, and they go up to crazy record all time highs, what is stopping me from taking my huge gains? I've beat the inflation already, I could get out before the bubble bursts. That mentality could easily hit the market sometime in the next year or so for a huge hurt. Or it could just not happen at all. I wouldn't say the sky is falling right now, but I wouldn't want to be in a position where I'm caught off guard if it does.",ScareOffEverything,4,/r/investing/comments/ntjsdw/real_estate_and_equities_synchronicity/h0sdu85/,0.052,0.793,0.155,0.9916

97,PTY," A lot of those don't sound so great. SCHD in particular is not the greatest dividend play, especially in this overbought market. You're not Warren Buffett, who generally concentrates in super-safe stocks and has increasingly made mistakes over the last couple of years.

Highly leveraged funds, e.g. TQQQ, are best used with regular rebalancing to harvest the large gains while minimizing losses. The potential for loss with those funds is extremely high right now. Also, the need for rebalancing triggers taxable events, so like dividend strategies I'd recommend using them in a non-taxable account.

Have you learned about CEFs and other types of non-ETF funds? Check out PTY, PSLDX etc. In fact, during a normal market, one strategy you might try is rotating through CEFs as their NAVs rise and fall. 

Another strategy is dividend capture. It's not for me, but with attention to detail is one way to grind. Another area to investigate is arbitrage.

The wheel strategy, used optimally, will generally net about 15% of premium. It's also a great way to enter a long-term position, and a good partner with dividend-paying securities.",jeff_varszegi,5,/r/investing/comments/ntlvd8/investing_strategies_i_plan_on_implementing/h0smmfc/,0.037,0.815,0.148,0.9736

>You're not Warren Buffett

Not sure what the point in saying that is. I know that. I was referring to his early strategy. Not the one he uses now that he is a multi billionaire. He can't buy small companies with a potential 500% upside because the returns compared to his net worth wouldn't be worth the effort. 

I'll look up CEFs. Could be interesting. 

Surprisingly dividend capture may work. Just looked at JNJ and their dividend could have been captured. Didn't fall by the same amount of the dividend issued until days later.",BeaverWink,0,/r/investing/comments/ntlvd8/investing_strategies_i_plan_on_implementing/h0spkan/,0.029,0.834,0.137,0.9062
