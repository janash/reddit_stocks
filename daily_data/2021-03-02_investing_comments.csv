0,EDUC," Your idea is pretty cool but the results don't look very promising.  All of these companies could have upside, but there's nothing in their history that suggests they do, and \*\*lots\*\* in their collective histories that suggests they'll revert to their pre-COVID form soon enough.  

Revenue: Only three of the ten (nine, actually since SPWH has been acquired) have 1yr or 5yr revenue growth above single digit and only four have revenue growth above 5%.    

Market Cap: only WSM is over $5B, and only four are over $800M and three are less than $200M.  That doesn't make them bad per se, but small companies like this often have wild swings in price, and below $200M, that's pretty speculative stuff.  

Pre-Covid Price: all but WSM (surprisingly) were in a multi-year declining price pattern prior to COVID.  

Probably the best candidates in this group are EDUC, WSM and HVT, all of which actually have overall long term uptrends, although very slow over a long time, and that's not considering the current valuation.  Again that's not to say these companies don't have upside.  but on a comparative basis to many of the other companies that are out there, these don't look attractive.

So Kudos for the effort but definitely take a look at some way to work up the quality of the top candidates.

25,HD," There was a recent article published in the WSJ regarding the current rise in demand and price for lumber, who is profiting, and why. 

The article explained that there is a surplus of timber available, which is mostly cut and shipped from southern US states. The tree farms where the logs are produced are making little money as a result, as sawmills have a tremendous number of options from which to purchase these raw materials (higher supply than demand). 

The difficulty is producing sawn lumber and getting it from the mill to the lumber yard. The saw mills are all working 24/7, where possible, so that they can fill all the orders from local companies like lumber yards, Home Depot, Lowe’s, etc. In this case, demand at the consumer level exceeds available supply, which increases price. The demand is greater, however, than the demand for logs, of which there are plenty. 

There is basically a bottleneck at the mills. This was a result of State government mandated shut downs during COVID. The mills were forced to either shut down or greatly reduce their capacity, while millions of home owners began renovation projects while they were stuck home quarantining. 

The sawmills are the companies experiencing higher profits as a result, while the timber farms make little to nothing due to the vast supply of raw materials. 

Retailers like LL and HD will certainly see higher volume and of course higher sales, but they are simply passing along the increase in cost, not raking in higher profit margins on the product. 

LL was looking for a buyout or to be taken private prior to this boom, and was continuing on a downhill trend from the highs of 2013, where it was over $100/share. 

This may be a case where the pandemic actually saved the company, who were able to stay in business through the shut down, at least in some capacity. 

The journal article explained that the correction to the demand curve may take years as the sawmills catch up to match the supply requirements, keeping the cost of wholesale lumber high, even as the demand for product decreases over time. This may ultimately result in lower sales *and* profits for LL over the long term, as the market for renovations/new wood flooring begins to get back to normal. Basically, when people get back to work and the demand for lumber stabilizes, the wholesale cost will remain high, and a specialty vendor like LL, who basically only deals in wood flooring, may begin to struggle to maintain operations due to the high cost of goods sold compared to revenue.",hotelactual777,6,/r/investing/comments/lvr5rl/list_of_stocks_ranking_highest_in_momentum/gpejlxa/,0.049,0.886,0.065,0.9042

27,MLM," It's an MLM scam who are recruiting an army of middlemen on Facebook and other social media to peddle their wares. They are rebranding cheap chinese cosmetics stuff and selling with a 1000% markup. The ""sellers"" are tricked into buying large amounts of products which they then have to sell to friends and family. Most of the time they cannot sell everything and are left behind with a large inventory, losing money in the process.

Because of the close connection factor on Facebook they also achieve some kind of organic mass manipulation of their ratings and reviews everywhere. Nobody wants to give a bad rating on the products that their auntie is selling.

33,VC," Microcaps are microcaps for a reason. They will just trade in that range forever, albeit with high volatility, so it could look like it's trending upwards with a 3x return in the past year, but then drop 70% the next year.

Nowadays, any company that has the chance to become a large cap is a private unicorn or if they're still in the microcap valuations, a startup funded by VC.

34,FNF," FNF was a selected play. I weight value and quality 2:1 over momentum, and in some cases remove momentum from the equation entirely. When I picked it up it was ranked much higher in value than today, and quality just improved in recent earnings. Financial was also the remaining sector not to see a full recovery by the end of last year so I was looking for rotation plays anyways. It came just shy of my 44 PT recently so I'm still in. 

SPWH was a bit of a swing and a miss. I typically avoid investing in B&M retail at all costs (I have a decent position in CLIX to give you an idea of my thoughts there), but It showed up across a set of different screeners, and in my experience I've had good luck with tickers the show up multiple times. Ended up hiring someone who was a manager at one of their stores so I took it as a sign to try it out. Ended up timing poorly so I'm almost out of the position.

36,SPWH," FNF was a selected play. I weight value and quality 2:1 over momentum, and in some cases remove momentum from the equation entirely. When I picked it up it was ranked much higher in value than today, and quality just improved in recent earnings. Financial was also the remaining sector not to see a full recovery by the end of last year so I was looking for rotation plays anyways. It came just shy of my 44 PT recently so I'm still in. 

SPWH was a bit of a swing and a miss. I typically avoid investing in B&M retail at all costs (I have a decent position in CLIX to give you an idea of my thoughts there), but It showed up across a set of different screeners, and in my experience I've had good luck with tickers the show up multiple times. Ended up hiring someone who was a manager at one of their stores so I took it as a sign to try it out. Ended up timing poorly so I'm almost out of the position.

Spotify will lose some users but they still contain a huge library of artists, especially western artists who are some of the most popular artists globally and domestically. It’ll still be a hit but probably not enough to really destabilize them.

However, it’s a bigger issue for the kpop industry. I believe Melon is only available in Korea and you need a Korean ID or phone number or something to even make an account. So it’s a process for foreigners to even get started there. Also who knows if this removal may start occurring in other streaming services.

This would allow the markets to trade flat while in actuality sorta degrossing the funds from the flooded stimulus.

2. European  inflation wont be greater than american inflation as the Euro is currently facing negative intrest rates - the have a low inflation economy and they have alot of flexibilty to raise rates.
3. The only nation that has stimulated itself into a corner like this is the US. No one else - bar maybe the UK - has put this much into its economy. 4tn dollars of stimulus plus rate cuts plus a bunch of QE will generate that super high inflation and I don't  believe that the rest of the planet will go nuts in the same way america did.

It's perfectly reasonable for them to buy back shares instead of sit on cash.

Or they had already authorized a buyback plan ages ago, did an ASR back in May after the stock tanked and it made sense to both due to the price being lower and financing costs dropping.

107,CEO," A buyback is used to increase the value for the shareholder without the taxation that comes from dividends, eventhough they both increase the value proportionally. 

Its no different from either the company or the shareholder but its arguably a circumvention of social responsibility. 

If, say, a billionaire owns stock which gives out a dividend, the increase in value is taxed so that the billionaire contributes. 

If that same billionaire were instead to only own stock that increase in value by stock buy backs, there would be no taxable event and the billionaire is subsequently able to improve liquidity by borrowing against the stock. 

In short its gives the ultra rich even more money without needing to tax a cent of it, while dividends still increase valuation proportionally but forces the ultra rich to at least contribute by paying the tax on the dividend. 

This is also only one aspect of it. 

Theres further discussion to be had about CEO compensation being tied to share prices and how this incentives them to imprudently issue buy backs in order to pump the price, something they wouldnt have done with corresponding costs if the only alternative was doing it through dividends. 

And I'm sure even more issues im less informed on",MJURICAN,24,/r/investing/comments/lw3v1m/warren_buffett_says_berkshires_apple_investment/gpfa4ry/,0.04,0.772,0.188,0.9883
108,CG," I’m posing this as a hypothesis, not a statement of fact, but it’s not as though buybacks avoid all taxation. If BRK buys back a stock, someone had to sell it to them which incurs capital gains tax. If BRK issues a dividend, that incurs a capital gains tax.

Think about it mathematically.

Taxes on dividends:
Distribution amount * CG rate = tax paid

Taxes on buybacks:
((Buyback amount - cost basis of sellers) * CG rate)

So yes, it definitely reduces taxes, but I don’t see how it exactly evades them. Plus that increased share price will incur additional taxes when shareholders sell in the future. That would add (share price appreciation due to buyback * CG rate) to the total tax revenue.

I don’t know how one would go about determining the exact difference in tax burden, but I suspect it’s smaller than some would make it out to be.",WePrezidentNow,7,/r/investing/comments/lw3v1m/warren_buffett_says_berkshires_apple_investment/gpfhblb/,0.058,0.794,0.148,0.9391

110,WFC," There are a few sectors still with low p/e, such as homebuilders and some banks and some energy.

But the high indebtedness of the government and many private companies is a concern, especially with rising long-term interest rates. Homebuilders, despite lower debt than in recent years, will be negatively affected with rising mortgage loan rates. And banks are, on average, giving fewer loans due in part to lack of creditworthiness of potential new borrowers; rising rates will only further exclude most companies and individuals from new loans.

Low profitability ""growth"" stocks will meet their doom with high bond yields or with significant recession. 

Which sectors are safe or fairly priced today? If the Fed starts buying long-term treasury notes and bonds, the yields will drop and homebuilders will be a steal at their present valuations. If not, low-leveraged and positive cash flow companies within rebounding sectors (like ATRO) are probably smart choices.

The metrics to focused on are the ones you highlighted. Enterprise customers buying in and spending more over time. Also agree that management is being conservative on guidance.

130,SP," I'm analyzing the index SPY, which tracks the S&P 500, and it's priced at 1/10 the S&P 500. [I've created a graph that shows us the chances of this future expected value of SPY (or 1/10 the value of the S&P500) VS the probability of attaining that value or less, so that I can analyze the purchasing of PUTS.](https://imgur.com/a/74Iyywz)

This is what this graph represents:

* The current value of the S&P 500 is 3,902. We have 108 days from now until June 18th, 2021. I looked at all the 108 day returns of the S&P 500 from 1980 onwards (n=5,118). 
* I determined that out of 5,118 outcomes, the lowest returns in 41 years would equate to the SPY going down to 225 on June 18th, 2021. Likewise, there's a 2% chance that the SPY will go down to 283 on June 18th, 2021. 
* On the other hand, I also determined that of all the 5,118 outcomes since 1980, there's also only a 2% chance that the SPY will go to 475. [The PUT price for this option, which expires on 6-18, is $88.06.](https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/SPY/options?expiration=2021-06-18-m&moneyness=allRows)  This means that **the intrinsic value is actually $3.26.**

Because there's a 98% chance that the S&P 500 won't attain or exceed 4750 in value (or the SPY won't attaint 475), this PUT almost guarantees that you'll be using it. 

This is similar to the PUT priced at 225, and it's intrinsic value is $0.85, and the chances of **NOT using this option** is only 2%. 

Let's analyze a few scenarios for what happens when you purchase this PUT with SP 475:

* When the S&P 500 goes to any of the 98% of likely outcomes, you'll be exercising this PUT, of course. However, you have an instrument that's negatively correlated with the movement of the S&P 500. 
* When the S&P 500 goes to 500, your option expires worthless. This is extremely improbable, but the extrinsic value of your option increases while the intrinsic value decreases. Of course, there's THETA decay that's going to decrease the value of your PUT.

From my (myopic) perspectives, if a person wants to get all the upside of the S&P 500 prior to June 19th, they can by purchasing this option. The EXTRINSIC VALUE of this PUT will increase when the S&P 500 increases drastically. When the S&P 500 decreases, you're protected also. 

So another words, for less than 1% the cost of the SPY (0.0083547 = $3.26/390.2), you have all the downside protection of the S&P 500. You can't lose any money, basically, on the downside. 

On the upside, you **could** gain some value in this put if the S&P 500 goes up (or down) drastically. 

This put will certainly gain value when the S&P 500 goes down in value, but in a ""muted"" way. 

So you're protecting your money on the up, on the down, and in 98% in between cases.

132,UK," This is a post for advice and opinions concerning the pharmacuetical giant Pfizer. Unless you have lived under a rock these last few months you are likely aware that Pfizer in partnership with BionTech have developed one of the approved vaccines for covid. The Pfizer vaccine is widely approved especially in Europe where their Belgiun manufacturing site provides the vaccine for EU countries in high demand. Aside from the vaccine Pfizer is a consistent player in the pharma industry and has its fingers in many lucrative medical markets especially with medical innovation.

When the vaccine was approved for use by the UK, and shortly after by the EU, Pfizer's share price on the US markets jumped to around $41 at its peak. But since then it has steadily dropped to below $34 at the current price. The March 1st price of $33.69 was the lowest price of Pfizer stock in 5 months. While this price drop seems to be unexpected it actually returns the share price to it's consistent average of the last year or so (hovering around $35). In science and in particular pharma companies the share price being consistent isn't unusual. But what I'm curious about is the impact on dividend payments going forward through 2021 and onward.

Pfizer is surely having a fantastic pay day from all these government funded vaccine orders. The forward dividend yield is above 4% I believe. Is this pay day for Pfizer likely to be reflected more in the dividend payments this year? And if so will the relatively low share price make Pfizer a sure buy in this volatile market? Or is there something I am missing?",GoodToBeDuke,2,/r/investing/comments/lvyknm/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gpfl310/,0.045,0.847,0.108,0.9607

I could accept a level of restriction, but if they only support S&P500 or something like that, I'd rather look elsewhere.  


\#2 - **free stock trades including penny stocks, doesn't need to be free options trading**.  I'd like to have a try at options trading, so as long as the fee/contract isn't crazy (I've seen lots of .65/contract - I think that's fine).  


\#3 - **the desktop app needs to be solid**.  The phone app should at least be functional.  I work from home and have multiple monitors, so watching tickers and acting on them while working is completely feasible for me.  I'd still like to be able to do some basic trading on my phone if I'm out.  


\#4 - **I want to avoid anyone that restricted GME, AMC, etc buying during that whole ordeal**.  I only held a small position in GME, so it's not like I lost a ton of money, but I do feel like that was extremely sketchy.  I want a brokerage that isn't going to restrict me.

tl;dr - I want a brokerage app that includes all of the **bolded** items above.  Help me out? <3",titeywitey,0,/r/investing/comments/lvyknm/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gpfoxj9/,0.062,0.771,0.168,0.9928
151,TLRY," I've got an investment account with Chase - opened it because I already bank with them and it had free trading, so I just went with it to dip my toes in.  


Now I'm looking at moving out due to a lack of features, so here's what I'm looking for:  


\#1 - **premarket and after hours trading**.  Been gut punched a couple times while watching my short-term investment tank overnight.  Wasn't fun to buy TLRY at 44, see it jump to 70 before EOD, and then watch it tank all the way to 30 before the market open the next day.  So yeah, definitely want wider coverage than just market hours.  I've seen that some brokerages severely restrict which tickers are supported outside of market hours - that's disqualifying for me.  I could accept a level of restriction, but if they only support S&P500 or something like that, I'd rather look elsewhere.  


\#2 - **free stock trades including penny stocks, doesn't need to be free options trading**.  I'd like to have a try at options trading, so as long as the fee/contract isn't crazy (I've seen lots of .65/contract - I think that's fine).  


\#3 - **the desktop app needs to be solid**.  The phone app should at least be functional.  I work from home and have multiple monitors, so watching tickers and acting on them while working is completely feasible for me.  I'd still like to be able to do some basic trading on my phone if I'm out.  


\#4 - **I want to avoid anyone that restricted GME, AMC, etc buying during that whole ordeal**.  I only held a small position in GME, so it's not like I lost a ton of money, but I do feel like that was extremely sketchy.  I want a brokerage that isn't going to restrict me.  This is ""play"" money for now, so I do not to support a broker that might put a stop to my actions and end up hurting my investment.

\#5 - *much lower priority for now*  \- **cryptocurrency** trading.

I'm aware that all of my desires are not likely to be met, but I can dream, can't I?

152,IMO," Shipping, cyclical retail, certain energy sectors, mining, finance, value ETFs have served as a nice combination of growth potential and hedge against this tech drawdown.

I'm down a touch today but it would have been far uglier were I deep in tech positions. I'd be lying if I said I had a read on this market - I don't. It just feels frothy and nervous, even though real inflation, real 10yr yields, and most macro data is neutral or bullish. IMO if you can get through the next few weeks breaking even or even taking small losses, you'll be in good shape big picture. If you have a high tolerance for risk (I do not), you could try and swing the open/close volatility and try to come out ahead. 100% my opinion, grain of salt.",135patriots,1,/r/investing/comments/lvyknm/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gpg80cv/,0.121,0.776,0.103,-0.765

165,HMY," look at 5 year on gold prices. we are at a low for the previous 6 months, but still sitting fairly high. no idea if/when gold will increase in the near future especially with people moving to crypto. 

with gold miners you want to look for their AISC (all-in sustaining cost). this is what it costs the miner per ounce of gold to mine, with all their expenses. the last figure I see for HMY is $1,341/oz, which is on the high side. if the price of gold falls below that value they cannot mine at a profit. gold was at the price less than two years ago.

Pennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

You can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies.

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies.

Pennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

You can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Pennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

You can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process.

201,IBKR," The main question that comes up when considering using refi money is: ""Can I pay the new mortgage amount with my salary?"" If you can, then yes, mathematically, you should end up in a better place by investing your money over the next 30 years. 

Please don't mistake the SPY for being ""safe"". A savings account is safe, but investments come with all sorts of risks, including sequence risk (e.g. how will you feel if you're down for an extended period of time?) 

The other consideration is: Are you going to continue to make contributions to your investments in addition to the money that you'll use during your refi? If yes, then you'll reduce your risk a bit because over time, you're able to buy at different points (both high and low). 

As far as the IBKR part; I run margin at IBKR and I find that to be an effective use of capital for me. However, I will state that I treat my investment accounts like bills and I add money to them every month. I typically recommend running no more than 1.35x margin, so you can withstand drawdown periods. If you start getting into higher levels of margin you can be closed out by IBKR's algo. It's tuned to be risk averse, so they'll close you out without a courtesy call.

212,GDP," >Their debt to GDP ratio is about 55%

You're looking ***only*** at sovereign debt, and completely ignoring corporate + private debt. Also, most of the ""private"" debt in China is state debt since so much of the ""private"" sector consists of state-owned enterprises, which are quasi government, but do not register officially as part of government indebtedness.

>Also, China had very little, if any stimulus packages in response to Covid.

Not true at all.

Take this, [https://www.bu.edu/gdp/2021/01/06/chart-of-the-week-the-fiscal-picture-in-china-2020/](https://www.bu.edu/gdp/2021/01/06/chart-of-the-week-the-fiscal-picture-in-china-2020/) and then also add in a large portion of unofficial stimulus by forcing large state-owned banks to lend and extend liquidity measures. IE, [growth in the shadow banking sector](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3090393/shadow-banking-back-vogue-china-assets-grow-first-time-2017) they had been trying to keep in check for the previous 4 years.

Not suggesting they had the largest stimulus, but saying they had very little stimulus is just not true at all. It's especially important to understand that a lot of the stuff came ""off the book"" and through channels that wouldn't necessarily show up in official stimulus data. IE, they can command private banks to lend. That does not show up in official stimulus plans, but it's an enormous part of things.",cbus20122,10,/r/investing/comments/lw57fj/china_is_sounding_the_alarm_about_a_global_market/gpg1s1n/,0.085,0.891,0.024,-0.8423

Also, does it really matter if it is sovereign debt or not. From the market’s perspective all of this debt is propping up bubbles regardless if it is sovereign debt or not.

That's assuming this is measuring all the inputs of the Chinese stimulus. Regardless, I agree with you that it was less than the USA's stimulus. But that does not mean they had very little stimulus, just means they weren't as large as the largest stimulus from the largest economy in the world.

The USA had by far the largest stimulus in the world, but we also have more room to be able to stimulate than a lot of other countries due to our position as the world's reserve currency.

>Also, does it really matter if it is sovereign debt or not.

Yes, actually it does. But regardless, it's not so much a matter of where the debt comes from, as it's a matter that you're ignoring the enormous amount of non-government debt in China. A highly conservative measure of their debt is at 317% debt to GDP, as of May 2020. FWIW, it's likely higher, and it's already far larger than the USA prior to the 08 financial crisis.

I've got an investment account with Chase - opened it because I already bank with them and it had free trading, so I just went with it to dip my toes in.

Now I'm looking at moving out due to a lack of features, so here's what I'm looking for:

\#1 - **premarket and after hours trading**. Been gut punched a couple times while watching my short-term investment tank overnight. Wasn't fun to buy TLRY at 44, see it jump to 70 before EOD, and then watch it tank all the way to 30 before the market open the next day. So yeah, definitely want wider coverage than just market hours. I've seen that some brokerages severely restrict which tickers are supported outside of market hours - that's disqualifying for me. I could accept a level of restriction, but if they only support S&P500 or something like that, I'd rather look elsewhere.

\#2 - **free stock trades including penny stocks, doesn't need to be free options trading**. I'd like to have a try at options trading, so as long as the fee/contract isn't crazy (I've seen lots of .65/contract - I think that's fine).

\#3 - **the desktop app needs to be solid**. The phone app should at least be functional. I work from home and have multiple monitors, so watching tickers and acting on them while working is completely feasible for me. I'd still like to be able to do some basic trading on my phone if I'm out.

\#4 - **I want to avoid anyone that restricted GME, AMC, etc buying during that whole ordeal**. I only held a small position in GME, so it's not like I lost a ton of money, but I do feel like that was extremely sketchy. I want a brokerage that isn't going to restrict me. This is ""play"" money for now, so I do not to support a broker that might put a stop to my actions and end up hurting my investment.

\#5 - *much lower priority for now* \- **cryptocurrency** trading.

I'm aware that all of my desires are not likely to be met, but I can dream, can't I?

Right now Fidelity looks like the front runner to me as they appear to satisfy everything except #5 crypto. Are there other apps that seem to satisfy my requirements? Thanks in advance!

251,GE," Would love some pointers from this awesome community. I’m 39, single and child-free, and have a steady salary that’s lower than what’s ideal for the area I live in (ie a nonprofit in San Francisco). I got started investing late — last year, which also happened to be good timing to enter. 

I opened a Roth with Schwab, maxed out the $6k because I had a cash gift, and put $5k into the brokerage account. The appointment with the consultant led to an algorithm-managed portfolio (“schwab intelligent portfolios”). I’ve been trading in the brokerage account, mostly holding, but my individual management is outperforming the IRA in this particular moment. 
The Roth has gained 18% (so the $6k is about $7,100 now) and the brokerage account with my picks is up 28% but that just happens to be today. 

Here are my questions: 
- I’ve been putting cash into the brokerage account but it actually needs to go to this year’s IRA contribution. That should be the priority, right? Max out the tax-sheltered account first? Should I liquidate some of the stocks in the brokerage account and move it into the Roth? (I know how the capital gains taxes are calculated but don’t know enough nuance to decide what to do here). 

- that leads to my bigger question: I can’t manage the Roth IRA myself right now because it’s that Schwab intelligent portfolio thing. But I’d like to pick stocks and ETFs to hold long term (for example I hold Apple and GE in the brokerage, those aren’t getting sold). Should I / can I open a second Roth and split the $6k between the two of them each year? 

Thanks for any input on how to use my small amount of extra income between the brokerage and Roths!",LunaScapes,1,/r/investing/comments/lvyk2i/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gpfldoe/,0.005,0.892,0.102,0.9804

Does anyone know if I’ll have issue with transferring to Fidelity due to being restricted on RH?",blckmror,1,/r/investing/comments/lvyk2i/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gpglw5f/,0.1,0.9,0.0,-0.8225

Pennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

You can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies. 

If you are using RH or WB that don't allow pennystocks there is a subreddit r/RobinHoodPennyStocks .
On NASDAQ many options like CTRM + SNDL + DGLY + HIMX + CIDM + NOK + ATOM+ ENG

I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies.

278,DD," I'm going to go recommend some sectors, so you can look into them more, and attach some more general personal stock recommendations at the end, but if you want I can provide more specific stocks in the following sector's. So my first sector recommendation would be hospitality and travel. Obviously the sector was effected by the pandemic, but as the end grows closer we could see a after covid economic boom like what was seen at the end of WW2, but some stocks in the sector have reached pre pandemic levels so may be a little risky. Next sector is food and drink, companies like coca cola and pepsi, these stocks were also affected by the pandemic as there income is mostly made from bulk selling to restaurants theaters etc, and on the reliance of an after covid boom could go back up to pre covid levels or higher. The next three are some more unrelated stocks which I chose sort of unrelated to the pandemic, these 3 are proctor and gamble, Sony and tencent. So proctor and gamble is a big company who owns lots of little companies, like head and shoulders, Gillette, oral b and more, they have a good dividend (where a company pays a little bit of their profits to shareholders) and is a good stable buy. Next is tencent, a Chinese conglomerate, polymatter did a video on YouTube about the company (not from an investing point of view). They are more of a risky stock as there share price per earnings is high (meaning that investing would be betting on there long term growth). Finally is Sony, a company I actually did a DD on, I'll attach it at the end  here. For all these stocks, there are some stock analysis on YouTube to check out, as its hard for me to explain it all in one message. Any questions feel free to ask as this is a long but simple explanation
Sony (SNE) DD. First, their image and sensing division. Currently, Sony has a staggering 53.5% share of the image sensor market with Samsung being in second with only 18.1%. Why do image sensors matter so much, well, image sensors are key for cameras, medical imaging equipment, security and surveillance, ai and robotics, barcode readers, phones (your phone will have Sony parts unless it's a Samsung) and most lucrative of them all, autonomous vehicles.This currently brings in 26% of Sony's revenue, at a 13.5% margin.                                
 
Next is Sony music, the biggest music publisher in the world. They have some of the biggest names in the industry, with artists like Ed Sheeran, 21 savage, childish gambino, DJ Khalid and more. And as music streaming grows (with Spotify reporting 29% year over year growth, and tencent music  70%), Sony will be in a great position to dish out music from its signed artists. Music makes up 16% of Sony's revenue at a margin of 20%.( I will talk more about ""other "" at the end of the DD, but just so you know, other is grouped into music).                                  

Next is playstation. Sony has managed to do something quite brilliant with playstation, they have managed a transition from physical games to digital games, why does that matter, well, digital games gives sony higher margins. But the most exciting aspect of playstation is ps plus, ps plus has went from only 4m subscribers back 6-7 years ago, to having 48m subscribers, more than HBO max, and actually, ps plus now has a bigger operating profit than Netflix, whilst Netflix had 2x the market cap of the entire Sony business. And that number of ps plus subscribers is only set to grow, with gaming being the fastest growing aspect of entertainment. It is also likely that we will give our children PlayStation's, who will in turn give their kids kids PlayStation, like how whole families come together to watch the Simpsons. You may be thinking of their competitor, Xbox, but Xbox has only really solidified in North America and western Europe, with Sony significantly beating them Asian market. Revenue 26%, operating margin 13%.                                           

Next is Sony pictures, a company you may be familiar with, they have made everything from the smurfs, Spiderman and the shark tank. You may know of the ongoing streaming war, and one of my favourite quotes is don't make wars, provide ammo, which is exactly what Sony is doing. You may not know but Netflix don't actually produce their exclusives, they out source it, and one of the studios they outsource it to is Sony, Sony has made quite a hit for Netflix, The crown, with a reported 73 million households watching it. But Sony pictures doesn't just do work for Netflix, they also have done Alex Rider, a prime exclusive and Greyhound, an apple TV exclusive. Sony pictures brought in 8% of revenue at a 9.6% margin.           

Next is Sony electronics, who make things from headphones, televisions and their world renowned camera's, there are countless videos on YouTube, of people positively speaking of their switch of Nixon to Sony, showing a high brand loyalty in the photography market. 10% of revenue at a 6.6% margin. 

Next is financial services, I can't comment too much on them, as I didn't research them thoroughly, but I can say that their revenue is  10% at a 10.6% margin. 

Now I will discuss other. So first up is Sony's quiet move into monopolising anime, the second fastest growing aspect of entertainment, they have acquired crunchy roll, funimaton, aniplex and more. This means that if will be very hard for other streaming services to compete with Sony's anime, like how it was hard to compete with Netflix. A another quote from my favourite business book is be best or be first, and Sony are doing both in the anime market.                                                                               
 
Next is Sony's car, I feel it's a marketing stunt to show off and advertise their parts to other automakers, but it really shows what Sony is capable of, with Sony audio in the car, sony image sensors, Sony infotainment and more. 

Lastly is their mobile game, I again can't comment too much on it but it is very popular in Asia and brings in 1 billon in revenue, any questions feel free to ask.

279,TV," I'm going to go recommend some sectors, so you can look into them more, and attach some more general personal stock recommendations at the end, but if you want I can provide more specific stocks in the following sector's. So my first sector recommendation would be hospitality and travel. Obviously the sector was effected by the pandemic, but as the end grows closer we could see a after covid economic boom like what was seen at the end of WW2, but some stocks in the sector have reached pre pandemic levels so may be a little risky. Next sector is food and drink, companies like coca cola and pepsi, these stocks were also affected by the pandemic as there income is mostly made from bulk selling to restaurants theaters etc, and on the reliance of an after covid boom could go back up to pre covid levels or higher. The next three are some more unrelated stocks which I chose sort of unrelated to the pandemic, these 3 are proctor and gamble, Sony and tencent. So proctor and gamble is a big company who owns lots of little companies, like head and shoulders, Gillette, oral b and more, they have a good dividend (where a company pays a little bit of their profits to shareholders) and is a good stable buy. Next is tencent, a Chinese conglomerate, polymatter did a video on YouTube about the company (not from an investing point of view). They are more of a risky stock as there share price per earnings is high (meaning that investing would be betting on there long term growth). Finally is Sony, a company I actually did a DD on, I'll attach it at the end  here. For all these stocks, there are some stock analysis on YouTube to check out, as its hard for me to explain it all in one message. Any questions feel free to ask as this is a long but simple explanation
Sony (SNE) DD. First, their image and sensing division. Currently, Sony has a staggering 53.5% share of the image sensor market with Samsung being in second with only 18.1%. Why do image sensors matter so much, well, image sensors are key for cameras, medical imaging equipment, security and surveillance, ai and robotics, barcode readers, phones (your phone will have Sony parts unless it's a Samsung) and most lucrative of them all, autonomous vehicles.This currently brings in 26% of Sony's revenue, at a 13.5% margin.                                
 
Next is Sony music, the biggest music publisher in the world. They have some of the biggest names in the industry, with artists like Ed Sheeran, 21 savage, childish gambino, DJ Khalid and more. And as music streaming grows (with Spotify reporting 29% year over year growth, and tencent music  70%), Sony will be in a great position to dish out music from its signed artists. Music makes up 16% of Sony's revenue at a margin of 20%.( I will talk more about ""other "" at the end of the DD, but just so you know, other is grouped into music).                                  

Next is playstation. Sony has managed to do something quite brilliant with playstation, they have managed a transition from physical games to digital games, why does that matter, well, digital games gives sony higher margins. But the most exciting aspect of playstation is ps plus, ps plus has went from only 4m subscribers back 6-7 years ago, to having 48m subscribers, more than HBO max, and actually, ps plus now has a bigger operating profit than Netflix, whilst Netflix had 2x the market cap of the entire Sony business. And that number of ps plus subscribers is only set to grow, with gaming being the fastest growing aspect of entertainment. It is also likely that we will give our children PlayStation's, who will in turn give their kids kids PlayStation, like how whole families come together to watch the Simpsons. You may be thinking of their competitor, Xbox, but Xbox has only really solidified in North America and western Europe, with Sony significantly beating them Asian market. Revenue 26%, operating margin 13%.                                           

Next is Sony pictures, a company you may be familiar with, they have made everything from the smurfs, Spiderman and the shark tank. You may know of the ongoing streaming war, and one of my favourite quotes is don't make wars, provide ammo, which is exactly what Sony is doing. You may not know but Netflix don't actually produce their exclusives, they out source it, and one of the studios they outsource it to is Sony, Sony has made quite a hit for Netflix, The crown, with a reported 73 million households watching it. But Sony pictures doesn't just do work for Netflix, they also have done Alex Rider, a prime exclusive and Greyhound, an apple TV exclusive. Sony pictures brought in 8% of revenue at a 9.6% margin.

322,FFC," CEF are a fine structure. Love, love, love having cheap leverage to juice returns. Love buying assets at a discount, with the option to sell at a premium if the situation arises. Love managers not having to sell assets if market sentiment changes and people panic sell.

Now, pretty much every CEF has capital appreciation as a secondary objective written into their prospectus, but the vast majority utterly fail at this. Returning capital to close discounts and maintaining outsized dividends, most of the time share price sinks over time which does not match my investment needs.

Here are ones I own and love.

NHS - Nueberger Berman junk bond fund. These guys are badass high yield traders and over the life of the fund have averaged 8.7% returns. Presently paying 8.8%. Share price has declined a bit over time but it’s a sacrifice I’ll make for their expertise.

RVT - Royce Value Fund got a big allocation in my portfolio. Royce has beaten the Russell 2000 over 30 years by maybe 30-40bps after fees. That’s damn impressive to beat an index. Small caps are a great asset. Their fees are totally reasonable and they have been around for a long time. Their dividend policy is based on a rolling average of share price, usually between 5-7%. This has allowed them to increase share price over time, albeit with a lot of volatility. Check them out. No leverage.

FFC - Flaherty and Crumrine Preferred Income. Except for a case of forced asset selling in the Great Recession, they have not lost asset value. So this fits my wheelhouse. Great managers. Preferred stocks. Some leverage. Had been waiting on an opportunity to buy into this one and got it March 2020. Was watching like a hawk and bought 5000 shares within 2 hours of the bottom.

UTF - Cohen and Steers Utility/Infrastructure Fund. Good managers.

RQI - Cohen and Steers Quality Realty Income Fund. 4-star Morningstar.

I have owned my share of worthless investments in startups that I really am incredibly skeptical of Reg CF offerings. It just seems like any business that can't attract angel financing is either run by inexperienced management or the founders are unwilling to seek outside expertise from venture firms.

Personally - I wouldn't touch a Reg A or Reg CF offering unless I know the founders and management team.

I imagine that the liquidity is either near zero or the shares will be overvalued. Have you ever had any success with these types of offerings?",greytoc,1,/r/investing/comments/lvuy6t/top_february_raises_of_crowdfunding_startups/gpeybyy/,0.07,0.832,0.098,0.4755
345,CEO," Kingscrowd covers both Reg A+ and Reg CF offerings.  Most of the larger ones are Reg A+.  I think SEC limits Reg CF to about $1 million and Reg A to $50 million.

There's definitely a wide range of companies on the Reg CF sites.  There's many I wouldn't touch and your characterization about inexperienced management is accurate.

However, there are some that I think have promise.  For instance, Cortex https://wefunder.com/cortex did an early round with angel investors where they raised $700k, before raising a reg CF round. Relay on Demand https://republic.co/relay has some compelling traction numbers and I think they'd have no problem raising from conventional angels.

I've also invested in a few dozen startups through angel list syndicates.  The average quality you see there is much better.  However, you pay 20% carry and another few % in expenses.  I think the top regCF companies, like Relay on Demand & Cortex, are comparable to the startups I see on angel list.

Liquidity is definitely not a thing when dealing with startups.  You have to commit to 5-10 years without seeing your money.

My best success appears to be with Cloudastructure.  It looks like I'm up 8-9x so far, but it's all illiquid.  The CEO has a reasonable plan and $25 million in the bank.  He's talking like there could be  SPAC merger, with public trading in a few years.

The biggest success is probably coinbase.  They raised their seed round on a crowdfunding site: https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/coinbase-first-crowd-funded-bitcoin-company-raises-over-600k/ and should be a $100 billion market cap company soon.
