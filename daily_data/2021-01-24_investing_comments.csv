2,GME,"Disclaimer: This is not investment advice. Do your own research.

A short squeeze on GME now has a very high probability of materializing. Due to naked shorting and greed (short interest above 100%), institutional shorts are trapped. The only way to solve this will be with a direct deal with GME board. In my view, they will ask for 2x-10x current price. This will give them enough funds to do important M&A and turnaround the company. Ryan is a very smart billionaire. They are not reaching to the media (e.g. Cramer) until the shorts realize they have no way out, but pay 10B-40B in a 10%-30% share offering.

69,GME,"No, this isn’t really the valuation of this stock. What’s happening here with GME is a short squeeze.

So you need to understand what “shorting” means. Most people understand the stock market as “buy low, sell high.” Shorting is the opposite of that in a way. When you short a stock, you expect the stock price to decline. You are borrowing the stock, and you promise to pay back that stock in the future. If you’re correct, and the stock you shorted kept declining in price, then you made money because you paid back at lower price than when you borrowed. If you guessed wrong, and the stock you shorted ended up doing well, then you lost money, because you’re paying back at higher than the price you borrowed it at. The principle is “sell high, buy low” basically.

GME happens to be a declining business, and GME is the single most shorted stock currently. With recent news of Ryan Cohen joining GME, people are thinking he will turn the company around, and they started buying GME stock. This was the catalyst for the short squeeze.

A short squeeze happens when a stock that was shorted a lot (GME) goes up in price quickly (Ryan Cohen news) and short sellers are panicking to buy the stock because they need to pay it back. This pushes the price up even further, thus making other short sellers having to buy back the stock at an even higher price, which pushes the stock price higher and higher. Repeat the process until all short positions are covered. 

It’s a supply-demand case. There are strong demand to buy GME stock (short sellers have to buy it back to pay what they borrowed), but little supply (people who own GME stock refusing to sell or keep buying because they understand how to short squeeze). It’s a losing battle for the people who shorted the stock, because they are paying interest on what they borrowed, so they are bleeding money waiting for GME price to drop. As long as the GME stock owners won’t budge and keep holding simply by sitting on their shares, GME price will go up, because short sellers are obligated to buy back GME stock eventually, even at a ridiculous price. With high demand and low supply, the sellers are in control and they can set the price much much MUCH higher than the stock is worth. They are squeezing short sellers dry. 

If you want to buy GME now and take advantage of the short squeeze, do some more research first because you need to know when to exit. If you are interested in buying GME long term, wait until the short squeeze is over. Once all short positions are covered, people will sell and take profit, which will crash the stock price to its appropriate evaluation.

That’s already a thing, except it’s entirely controlled by the games and console makers themselves. Microsoft, EA, and Ubisoft all already have subscription services that work exactly like this. Why would they let GameStop use their games for something like this to compete with their own services? Why would Microsoft and Sony allow an app like this onto their consoles when they can just do it themselves (and already have, in the case of Microsoft)? What would GameStop even bring to the table in such a partnership? They don’t make the games. They don’t make the consoles.

**Fidelity**:

Pros:  The people I have talked to on the phone are nice.   They have a desktop client, even if it looks from the 80s.  Actual in-person location, even if I have never used one.  

Cons:  Cannot set (sell) limit orders at greater than 50% last price\*.  Cannot use funds in account to sell cash secured puts for a lower entry.    
\* This is really irking me, because during the day I am at work, not on my IRA.  I want to be able to set it and forget it.

**Vanguard:**

Pros:  I love that they are investor owned. 

Cons:  Egads that website for making trades is horrible!   (Haven't played with it too much)

**TDA**:  

Pros:  ThinkorSwim - I am liking the client, the ability to set conditional & chained orders, and the mobile apps as well.  

Cons:  fees?  (haven't found too many, other than the normal delays in waiting for cash to settle)

198,AAPL,"Overweight on single stock (20% of portfolio) - How do you decide to sell a rising stock?

I first posted to the teslainvestorsclub as I am overweight (in my opinion) on TSLA but had replies from people who were 100% invested in that one stock so looking for a more rational perspective here. Tried posting in personalfinance but was directed here (sorry for not choosing this place first - in hindsight it does make the most sense)

Background:  
I currently own 660 shares of TSLA with the two 'big' original buys in 2018 of 60 shares at pre-split $290 and 1/2020 of 40 shares at pre-split of $575. Those became 500 shares at cost basis of approximately $80/share post-split. These shares are in a standard brokerage account. I have since purchased another 160 shares mostly in my IRA. Those 660 shares of TSLA now make up 23% of my invested portfolio (including 401k and 529s). My preset target when I rethought investing few years ago was no more than 20% of portfolio would be allocated to individual shares (I also own AAPL, DIS and AMZN so the 4 stocks now make up 33% of my portfolio).

My questions are:

1. Is 23% considered overweight? In my mind it sure feels that way
2. How do you deal with a rising stock in terms of selling without FOMO
3. Is 'reverse DCA' (sell a bit every so often) a good strategy
4. Is it better to set a stop at $50 to $100 lower than the current price for the lot of 500 shares?
5. On Vanguard, is there a way to set a percent drop to trigger a sale on specific lots?

Even after selling the lot of 500 (all long term cap gains now), that would still leave me 160 shares and would balance out my portfolio a bit more. However I don't necessarily want to miss gains so I could also keep riding the stock higher and adjust the stop limit every 60 days.

The rest of my portfolio allocation is 37% US Stocks (Hancock SP500 for 401k, VTSAX and VFIAX), 11% International (VTIAX), 14% bonds (Hancock 401k), 5% cash and then 8% AAPL, 23% TSLA, 3% AMZN, 1% DIS.

218,VXUS,"Good job maxing your Roth and having an emergency fund! You’re doing well! Pat yourself on the back.

Yes, you’ve slightly set yourself back by not adding to your Roth earlier. But don’t sweat it. A significant percentage of 29-year-olds have nothing invested at all. You’re still ahead of the curve. And you can still retire with a lot of tax-free and tax-deferred money if you play your cards right from now on, especially once you’re a fully fledged doctor.

With that said, here’s my “personal finance” advice. Keep maxing your Roth. If you have money to spare, consider putting it in your employer’s plan. You’ll be able to roll the 401(k) over into a traditional or Roth IRA when you part ways with that employer (which should be within a few years, since you’ll no longer be a resident). It’s possible you’ll be able to roll it over now if your plan permits “in service” rollovers.

Now, here’s my “investing” advice. You indicate that you’re interested in stocks and actively managed ETFs that have done well in 2020. The problem is that you’re “chasing returns”. This is not a good strategy. I recommend doing some research to see the data which indicates chasing yesterday’s hot stock is not a good strategy.

I strongly recommend sticking with Vanguard’s index funds for all your investing. Buying and selling individual stocks is risky and tax inefficient. Buying actively managed funds like ARKF is also tax inefficient and will result in you losing money every year to high fees. 

Definitely do not sell your VFIAX/VOO in your taxable account to buy another investment. You’ll be paying capital gains taxes, which will make the move even worse.

If you do want to slightly improve your investment strategy, I recommend the following. First, direct the majority of your incoming money to VTSAX (or VTI if you do ETFs) rather than VFIAX/VOO. The total stock market fund is more diversified, so you should see benefits over time. Second, consider directing some money into VTIAX/VXUS (Vanguard’s total non-US index fund). This offers significant diversification at the cost of slightly higher fees and taxes.

302,GME,"The current path you are on leads to inevitable financial ruin.  You describe yourself as risk averse, but you have been selling options and now you've put all of your money in a single recently IPO'ed company.  By any sensible standard of risk, you are accelerating toward the edge of a cliff with the foot on the gas.

The reason why it doesn't feel like you're taking risk is that you were still learning the alphabet the last time there was a real bear market.  (No, last March doesn't count.)  I hope the next one comes soon, because it's probably going to wipe you out and it's better if you learn the lesson young.

If you want your money to survive a little longer than that, diversify.  Put the bulk of your money in index funds, and if you want to learn about investing then reserve 10% of your portfolio for your own moves.  But for the love of god, learn how to measure the risk of a portfolio so that you understand why not to put all your money in a single stock.

Also, there are much better ways to take risk than stock picking.  Investing in the S&P 500 with margin has a positive expected value if you start young, even factoring in the probability of getting wiped out.  There are high risk options strategies with positive expected values as well, but they require a bigger bankroll.

In short, the only FOMO you should have is for not getting the practically guaranteed millions you can make off of the basic market premium starting your age.  I'm in GME, and yeah I guess it's kind of fun - but I'm donating all of the gains to charity.  If the stock tanks (still likely, even after a good week) then I'll donate some of the money I didn't risk to charity.

There's a scene in one of the old Austin Powers movies where he's playing blackjack and decides to stand with a 5 and a 2 or something.  When told he should probably hit he replies ""I like to live dangerously"".  Owning only one stock is the investing equivalent of this.

The problem is that there are very few profitable investment theses that apply to only one company.  If you write down your precise argument for why RKT is the best possible stock, the one of two things will happen.  Either you will write down something too specific ""mortgage companies founded in Detroit in 1985"", in which case your thesis is untestable and you're just guessing.

Otherwise you'll write down a testable argument, and you'll find that it applies to 10 other companies.

338,TV,"I used to work for AT&T and spent some time at the various HQ buildings. Stephenson (the former CEO) wanted to leave his legacy the same way his predecessor did. Via M&A. 

His predecessor got Cingular and sort of pieced back together some of the broken up pieces of Bell from the 80s. Did a fantastic job and created the number 1 mobile carrier. 

Stephenson wanted to replicate this success and bought DirecTV at the worst possible time and also had other internal failures like Digital Life. 

Honestly, just about anything we bought or touched became worth less within a few years. A lot of this is due to an archaic six level management system and poor hiring practices. When a company was acquired, we'd fire all their knowledge and leadership and replace them with our own internal people who sometimes had zero experience in that industry (see: Time Warner.)

It's not a well run company in either an organizational leadership sense, nor in a strategic sense. It's heavily unionized (even the retail store workers.) 

I don't love AT&T as a stock, but if they can figure out how to run Warner Media properly, and not continue to lose millions of customers to TMobile, and they stop making bad large purchases....then maybe the stock will go back to $40 where it was when I sold it a couple years ago.

The system works so well, that the converse is also true:

* If you didn't pay taxes on it, ***you didn't make a profit***.
