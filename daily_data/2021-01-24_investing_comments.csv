That means that if the stock goes up for *any* reason, short sellers come under pressure to buy shares to close their short positions. But when the first short seller cracks and buys shares (taking a loss) they inadvertently drive the price up further, adding to the pressure on the other short sellers. Soon it‚Äôs a race to buy shares, but there simply aren‚Äôt enough to go around, so the price skyrockets before falling back down as shareholders finally take profits and sell. This is called a ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù. The only way a short squeeze is averted is if the stock price drops for some reason (like bad news from the company). GME is at ATH right now so it‚Äôs very unlikely that the short sellers will get out alive. It‚Äôs a matter of *when* they start to crack, not *if*. By all accounts they haven‚Äôt cracked yet, so the short squeeze hasn‚Äôt actually started.

What happened Friday was a ‚Äúgamma squeeze‚Äù, which is unrelated to a short squeeze, but happens when call options are being bought extremely fast and the stock price is rising, which indirectly causes market makers to buy massive volumes of shares to hedge, driving the price higher, and so on.

The high probability of a massive short squeeze caused retail traders to plow money into shares and calls on Friday, which in then caused a gamma squeeze, causing the stock price to go higher, making the short squeeze even *more* likely.

If you have gambling money and you want to take part in this unique event, you either buy shares or call options. Shares are safer (since no matter when the squeeze occurs, you‚Äôre ready, while calls expire) but calls give you leverage. Calls, even far OTM and short expiry calls, are likely to be very expensive. Everybody knows this is going down, it‚Äôs been covered on major news, and retail money is flooding in as people try to get onboard before the shorts crack.

73,GME,"The bear case for GME:

- Expectations are ludicrously high, with many investors putting in tons of money for ‚Äúguaranteed‚Äù 10x returns. If those fail to materialize, or if the share price starts to slip, it‚Äôs very easy to see this end up crashing with a lot of panic selling.
- This may actually get kicked off Monday morning: FOMO buyers drive the price up, and then people start taking profits by mid-afternoon.
- The actual market cap of GME isn‚Äôt super-high which means big institutional players do have the margin to wait out a short squeeze. They‚Äôre not stupid, and they have the whole weekend to figure out how to move around risk in order to avoid needing to cover their shorts right away. They‚Äôre not buying at these levels when they can just wait a week.
- Similarly, a lot of people are claiming that the short squeeze hasn‚Äôt happened yet. But the stock has been ~100% shorted for a while now. Maybe some smaller players did get squeezed last week. Maybe that‚Äôs all we‚Äôll see. I don‚Äôt know.",0.066,0.874,0.06,-0.0595

Suppose a market maker sells you GME call when it‚Äôs far OTM and has delta -1. To be delta neutral (a net delta of 0) they buy one share of GME. GME starts moving and your call isn‚Äôt so far OTM anymore, now delta is -25. The market maker has to buy 24 more shares to stay delta neutral. Of course it‚Äôs not just you, it‚Äôs ten thousand retail traders, so that‚Äôs 240 thousand shares they have to buy. That buying pushes the price higher, which in turn makes your call is ITM. Delta shoots up to -75 and suddenly the market maker has to buy an additional 500 thousand shares. They start falling behind and can‚Äôt stay delta neutral, meanwhile retail investors keep piling in and the price *explodes*.

Eventually trading is halted and the market maker evaluates the situation, catches up hedging, and everybody catches their breath. Trading resumes and now maybe retail traders decide to cash out, the price drops, the calls move OTM again, delta drops, the market maker can offload shares, and the stock stabilizes at a lower price.

It‚Äôs called a *gamma* squeeze because gamma is the derivative of delta, and it‚Äôs the rapidly changing delta (i.e. high gamma) that causes the squeeze.

So in theory, if *most* of the share holders truly understand this plan without a doubt and are onboard on a single sell price, let's say $1000, you can safely bet that GME squeeze will top around that price.

The higher the price people unite to, the higher this top will be but it's impossible for average retail investors to understand this concept and the higher the price r/wsb calls, it just becomes mentally more unrealistic for the average people to get onboard with.

115c is far out of the money in comparison to 75c. It'll have really good returns though; you just gotta hope the squeeze happens (when it does) before your contract expires.

163,CEO,"There are key differences to note here. 

First, Porsche locked up 75% of shares by themselves, with Lower Saxony holding another 20%. With ~4% in retail hands, this left about 1% free float. They did not have to deal with problems like investors panic selling or profit taking. By contrast, the GME squeeze has to deal with a much more liquid float, giving shorts a lot of room to deploy strategies and close their positions with less bleeding.

Secondly, Porsche was able to engineer their own catalyst. The VW squeeze was triggered by a sunday announcement that Porsche had acquired 75% of outstanding shares. The KBIOs squeeze was similarly triggered when Martin Shkreli announced himself as CEO. The GME squeeze is not being headed by any institution or group - it's just a rabble of random investors who don't have a voice on the market.

Blockchain is a publicly maintained list of every transaction that has ever happened on that given cryptocurrency. There is also no one central authority that can control that currency (for decentralized blockchain). This means you don't need banks to track how much money you have, you don't need Visa/ACH/SWIFT etc. to process transactions on your behalf, and there is no single entity that can create more on a whim. It is more functional, reliable, and trustworthy than any central currency could ever be.",0.039,0.899,0.062,0.3818
199,CEO,"It's multifactorial. There's the obvious incentive where Bitcoiners need to literally convince everyone that gold should not be the store of value and that Bitcoin is the new gold. This narrative has gotten pretty far but because this is such a matter of pure faith there is going to be a religious sort of belief about it. You have to either choose between gold or Bitcoin and you can't really believe in both.

The other thing is that people who really start getting into Bitcoin sometimes have an epiphany of sorts where they finally understand enough different pieces of the puzzle that they honestly start believing that it's just an unbelievably incredible invention. Like they become crazy, crazy, crazy passionate about it. Michael Saylor is probably a good example. One minute he's the CEO of Microstrategy, the next minute he's tweeting about [cybernetic hornets and the goddess of wisdom and the fire of truth](https://twitter.com/michael_saylor/status/1347164970929287168) on twitter while borrowing money to buy more Bitcoin. Which honestly makes him sound like a complete nutcase, but people who've undergone a similar epiphany really get it. It took me years but when I finally ""got it"" I got extremely excited about it though not to the extent where I started raving about cybernetic hornets.

Nowadays I honestly tell people not to invest in Bitcoin if they don't want to go all the way and become a stark raving lunatic like Saylor. The problem is that casually investing in it means that you're much more likely to FOMO in at the top of a bubble and then because you're not a religiously obsessed lunatic like the hardcore Bitcoiners are, you're much more likely to sell during a large correction. The hardcore Bitcoiners will just add to their holdings even if their net worths have plummeted 80% and likely end up OK in the long run, but most casual investors just going with the momentum are the ones losing their shirts.

So really what it is, is that Bitcoin is a huge leap of faith, and the people who actually do well investing in it NEED to become full blown ""members of the cult"" or they're much more likely to lose money by buying and selling at exactly the wrong times. If you don't want to become a raving cultist like your friend then I honestly say not to buy any Bitcoin. Folks who get into it, really, really get into it and become Michael Saylor loonies.

They aren't open to a serious conversation, they only want to be right. It's not just BTC or MLM or cultists (do you really know any cultists?). Entrenchment is a weird part of the human condition for sure, without it our species would not have effectively genocided all other forms of upright hominids. Our species may not have survived if it weren't for our blind faith that bound us together. Earth would certainly be a better place.

You probably have some entrenchment yourself but it's hard to see from the inside. I know that I do.

People become entrenched in de-centralized money it because they feel the injustice of the current system... or just because they see it as a way to make a bunch of money and don't want any rain on their parades. Most holders I know understand the risk to bitcoin but their belief is that it will prevail. I bought one full bitcoin at about 600 bucks, I don't have any intention of selling it at less than 100k, but I  don't think I would buy at 30 or 40k either.

It's definitely not too good to be true. Powerful governments are threatened by it. This is both a good sign and a bad. Considering that some economies that don't have good access to stable currency could really benefit from this, I don't believe that regulation from the superpowers will necessarily eliminate it. It may fall but it won't fall to zero. From what I understand the recent surge in price has been related to institutional investors purchasing up coins. It seems clear to me that the bigger it gets, the less likely it is to fail'

Decades ago,  a financial planner showed me an investment pyramid. It showed most of your money (at the base of the pyramid) in very stable investments, and less money in more growth oriented and thus considered riskier investments (middle of pyramid) and at the very top of the pyramid was  lottery ticket. The stuff near the top of the pyramid is called a ""portfolio driver"". Not risking a lot,  but if it does well then it can have  dramatic effect.  If you consider bitcoin to be just below that lottery ticket then you're probably thinking about it right.

Most people just go for the lottery ticket and forget the rest. If you have a balanced investment portfolio then there is probably a place for crypto.

207,OCC,"Foreword: We‚Äôve exchanged comments previously and your stance on crypto is clear. However it‚Äôs important that readers are in possession of as much information as possible.

> With 7 transactions per second for the whole world?

This misses the point. OP is referencing a currency reserve, not a transaction layer. The key point in respect of this are the credentials as a store of value i.e. gold. Gold is not easy to transact with, yet that did not preclude it from being a currency reserve. Although the gold standard is long since gone, what we are seeing with the rate of FED money printing really brings in to question USD as *the* world currency reserve. 

Raoul Pal describes this well:

[Basically the central banks over time cannot create more of it and that protects its value AND therefore, its value during collateral shortages (recessions) goes up, forcing only the strongest creditors to have access to it and thus allowing the business cycle to work in weeding out the weakest creditors...Bitcoin is pristine collateral. The greatest form of collateral. It‚Äôs blockchain ownership structure reduces the huge black swan risk of who owns what. It‚Äôs all recorded and more importantly, provable.](https://twitter.com/raoulgmi/status/1300580252855525376?s=21)

Scalability is not relevant in respect of using Bitcoin as collateral, as it is just that, collateral i.e. security in the event of default.

Even then, what we are seeing is Bitcoin being tokenised on other blockchains to make it more issuable i.e. wBTC and renBTC. That way it still maintains its pristine collateral status, but can be transacted more freely.

> Ban businesses from accepting crypto, ban the exchanges, ban banks from allowing any crypto related transactions and all those bitcoins become useless.

Whilst this is not a total impossibility, we are in fact seeing the very opposite. Governments are looking to embrace blockchain technology, not ban it. Yes there will be regulation, but they recognise the benefits of the underlying technology.

This misses the point. OP is referencing a currency reserve, not a transaction layer. The key point in respect of this are the credentials as a store of value i.e. gold. Gold is not easy to transact with, yet that did not preclude it from being a currency reserve. Although the gold standard is long since gone, what we are seeing with the rate of FED money printing really brings in to question USD as *the* world currency reserve. 

Raoul Pal describes this well:

[Basically the central banks over time cannot create more of it and that protects its value AND therefore, its value during collateral shortages (recessions) goes up, forcing only the strongest creditors to have access to it and thus allowing the business cycle to work in weeding out the weakest creditors...Bitcoin is pristine collateral. The greatest form of collateral. It‚Äôs blockchain ownership structure reduces the huge black swan risk of who owns what. It‚Äôs all recorded and more importantly, provable.](https://twitter.com/raoulgmi/status/1300580252855525376?s=21)

Scalability is not relevant in respect of using Bitcoin as collateral, as it is just that, collateral i.e. security in the event of default.

Even then, what we are seeing is Bitcoin being tokenised on other blockchains to make it more issuable i.e. wBTC and renBTC. That way it still maintains its pristine collateral status, but can be transacted more freely.

> Ban businesses from accepting crypto, ban the exchanges, ban banks from allowing any crypto related transactions and all those bitcoins become useless.

Whilst this is not a total impossibility, we are in fact seeing the very opposite. Governments are looking to embrace blockchain technology, not ban it. Yes there will be regulation, but they recognise the benefits of the underlying technology.

That is tantamount to assuming infinite risk on the assumption that the company will go bankrupt very quickly.

Even more egregious was what happened when key fundamental developments at GameStop made it clear that the possibility of a turnaround was rising dramatically. First, the short interest dropped by around 25% briefly around mid July‚Äîthis was probably smarter shorts covering early. Second, however, other shorters decided to double down even more, culminating in peak short interest on Thursday Jan 14.

The shorters who kept doubling down as GME clawed back from just over $4 in July to about $20 before the pop to $30+ on Jan 14 that marked the turning point in r/wsb sentiment, willingly taking on exponentially increasing risk with no theoretical limit, are the real insane risk takers in this still-unfolding scenario.

241,GME,"No offense taken. Just a point of clarity - my job is to evaluate companies to buy, grow, and to eventually flip later on for a profit. I don't think about companies in terms of short term price targets. They have no bearing in how I invest or think about companies. 

On a very simple basis, if you invest in any stock you are investing with the hopes of making a return. Depending on the company/industry/situation, you may have higher or lower return expectations. So if GME has a $4.5bn market cap today and you said I want at least a \~15% annual return for investing from here on out, that would mean in 5 years, GME will require a market cap of $9bn. For context, GME hasn't had a $9bn market cap since 2007/2008 due to declining sales/ profitability. 

Again, I think there's a real bull thesis here, but it's anyone's guess how long it will take to turn around the company (hence why I advocate to hold long here if you have conviction). Investors will try to triangulate future valuation based on future revenue and profitability. So depending on your return threshold and projections, you can determine what price you're willing to pay today. I personally would want closer to a 20%-25% annual return given this is a company in transition. Which at today's market cap would mean the company is worth \~$11bn to \~$14bn in five years.

At your $45 entry price, if GME is able to achieve a $8bn market cap in 5 years, you'll have made a 20% return. For GME to reach a $8bn market cap, it can achieve less in revenue growth and profitability than it needs to achieve a $11bn valuation which de-risks you investment, and why I made a comment on valuation. 

Hope that helps and makes sense to you.",0.026,0.881,0.093,0.9524

Apple product buyers are by nature tech savvy and wealthier but they still have stores to enhance their brand, allow users to test their new products, and to fix any physical issues. I'm not an expert on experiential retail but I suspect game developers would prefer to have a physical retailer promoting video games, potentially hosting local e sports tournaments, and better educating the consumer on their consoles (I expect video game consoles to increase in complexity /capability over time) and accessories.

And as for complementary products, I think you'd be surprised at how many kids like kitschy type things which are basically free margin to the IP holders.

I am thinking of selling off SPY and ITOT and rolling those into ~50% VTI and the extra going into emerging markets. Selling CSCO (underperforming and WebEx blows) and XLF and having those as cash in the brokerage to jump on something better. 

I have another 30k in cash the wife and I are saving for a house later this year. Combined we make under 80k so I think we are good from Capital Gains tax. High risk kind aguy

Alrite, enough talking, excited to see what you all think and what I can tweak.

286,USA,"Is my financial advisor's strategy sensible?

In USA.  Money is to live on now thru forever (as though I retired now).
Age 50, single, no debts.

I decided to work with a financial advisor through vanguard.   They take 0.3% for this service.     His plan is 60% stocks, 40% bonds, with approx one year of expences always sitting in a money market fund, ready if I need it.   

This strategy gives me enough to live on comfortably to age 100, but I feel like I want to be more aggressive.    My only goal for making more money would be to live a little larger - make nicer improvements to my home, take more expensive vacations, etc.  Heck, donate more money.    Basically, why leave money on the table.    But, maybe I am too optimistic.

TL: Does 60 % stocks/ 40% bonds seem appropriate for 50 year old retired person?

# I need some clarification on Options.

I understand Calling and Putting, but my question is:

1. If the stock is at 3.510 & you buy a call at strike 1.5, what stock price has been met to break even and then profit?
2. Why would anyone buy a strike on the money instead of in the money?
3. (let's say I can predict the future & the stock price is going to $6 1/29/21. Aren't you better off getting the lowest strike call?

291,BV,"Hi,

New to investing this year and im excited to learn more/start working towards some of my financial goals!

I am a 24 year old male making 75k a year and living in Canada. I started investing through a broker this year and he recommended two funds plus bonds. my risk tollerance is pretty high as i've been dilgently saving my whole life.

I have about $43,000 BV in Two ETFS

1. Instrument ExchangeCADFUNDS: Instrument [SymbolFID5973.CF](https://SymbolFID5973.CF)
2. Instrument ExchangeCADFUNDS: Instrument SymbolCIG1703.CF

My market value for these stocks are now $80,000 since investing of mark in last year (which i realize was a incredibly quick bounce back from a dip. Curently investing $1,200/month into the above two funds for the remainder of 2021.

I recently pulled $15,000 USD from my TFSA that i want to use to 'play' with in the market. i've been sturggling with how i want to break my portfilio up but after doing quite a bit of reading this past weekend I am starting to second guess my strategy of investing in all stocks.

Should i may consider doing a 50/50 or 60/40 split with ETFS to stocks in this new wealth simple portfolio..

ETFS im interested in are ARKK and ARKF which are already fairly similar to the funds i have above. Both hold SQ, Zoom ECT. Currently, Im leaning towards 25% in ARKK 25% in ARKF and then holding the other %50 in 4 stocks that im interested in which are MMED (canadian based phyclibin company), NIO, ENPH, PLTR.

This would be high risk portfolio that I ideally use for a down payment at some point.

Not sure if im too highly leveraged on tech stocks in my protfolio and if i should consider something more steady like the VOO or VTF.. mixed with some stocks. 

I guess my main qustion is how should i be investing for my high risk wealth simple account. Do i want to try these very popular ARK funds or should i try to anchor what i have with the tride and true VOO/VTF.

Secondly, should i start investing in my RRSPS to buy my first potential home?

I try to avoid ""beating the market"" but I have to overarching opinions that inform my strategy:

- I'm bullish on tech/green energy etc. in the long term, but in the short term (5 yrs) I think there's too big of a correction risk. Theres just so much money being pumped in by retail these days. So I think I want to weight my portfolio against hype stocks like TSLA which are disproportionately weighted in total stock ETFs.

-I also want to avoid interest rate risk, so I lean towards common share equity over preferred shares and bonds.

My initial thought is something along the lines of:

40% - NOBL (ProShares S&P 500 Aristocrats) - good exposure to industrials and consumer staples I believe to be lower risk than large cap tech over the next few years. Consistent with low risk dividend focus.

20% -  XDV (iShares Canadian Dividend) - good exposure to Canadian banks which are reliably high dividend yield. Bit of a hedge against USD vs CAD depreciation (ultimately I will be withdrawing these funds in CAD).

40% - VT (vanguard total world equity) - basic anchor so my portfolio doesn't deviate too much from a large basket of equities. While I think tech is a bit of a bubble right now, I don't want to bet my whole portfolio against it.

 * FBIOX Fidelity Select Biotechnology Portfolio
 * FSEAX Fidelity Emerging Asia Fund
 * FBALX Fidelity Balanced Fund
 * FCVSX Fidelity Convertible Securities Fund
 * FHIGX Fidelity Municipal Income Fund

For my UK retirement account they don't have a post-tax option. It's basically pre-tax or nothing. However, for the amount of money I'm able to deposit into it I'm taxed at 40%.

Does it make more sense to sit-out on my Roth and just put what would be the balance into my UK account since it shelters it from 40%? E.g. is that likely a better return? I can't imagine i'll be taxed at 40% in retirement.

340,TV,"I used to work for AT&T and spent some time at the various HQ buildings. Stephenson (the former CEO) wanted to leave his legacy the same way his predecessor did. Via M&A. 

His predecessor got Cingular and sort of pieced back together some of the broken up pieces of Bell from the 80s. Did a fantastic job and created the number 1 mobile carrier. 

Stephenson wanted to replicate this success and bought DirecTV at the worst possible time and also had other internal failures like Digital Life. 

Honestly, just about anything we bought or touched became worth less within a few years. A lot of this is due to an archaic six level management system and poor hiring practices. When a company was acquired, we'd fire all their knowledge and leadership and replace them with our own internal people who sometimes had zero experience in that industry (see: Time Warner.)

It's not a well run company in either an organizational leadership sense, nor in a strategic sense. It's heavily unionized (even the retail store workers.) 

I don't love AT&T as a stock, but if they can figure out how to run Warner Media properly, and not continue to lose millions of customers to TMobile, and they stop making bad large purchases....then maybe the stock will go back to $40 where it was when I sold it a couple years ago.

I mean here's an article stating their breakeven is $55-65, dated 2 months ago.

What am I missing?

EDIT: this?  I see a quote of $37 here after talking about heavy cutbacks in costs. But that seems to be at a single site. They shouldn't be achieving it more broadly for years to come. (The company has identified 10 locations where it plans to construct identical facilities over several years, each producing around 40,000 barrels per day. The first iteration is expected to begin producing oil somewhere around 2022. )

BP expects to be able to dramatically lower its costs so it can balance its books even from a breakeven oil price of $56 a barrel last year to $35 a barrel for 2021

412,GME,"It's... Close enough to the basics... 

For any traded company, there is a limited number of stocks out there. But shorting isn't holding a stock, it's borrowing one to sell. The idea is to buy it back later when the price is lower and pocket the difference. When investors are smell a company that might go bankrupt, they get excited about free money, and lots of shares get shorted. The more shares get shorted, the more will eventually need to be bought back to close the short positions. 

Shorting happens all the time and is a very normal part of the market, and while squeezes happen, they normal only account for nice little stock jumps. Think maybe 10-20%. Maybe a doubling for the entire squeeze.

A quick Google says a high short interest on a given stock is 10% of shares. 20% would be considered extremely high. 

The reason that this GME squeeze is likely to rocket is because of the size of the short interest. 

For GME, there are more shares shorted than exist. This is why the squeeze should be big. Pick your planet big.

I don‚Äôt think that what you‚Äôre seeing is a ‚Äúmajority of people‚Äù gambling their stimulus checks away especially as it relates to the broader small caps. Anecdotally, lots of folks have more money than they‚Äôve had in a very long time right now. Plenty of white collar companies still awarded their bonuses and overall, we saw some pretty decent returns across corporations last year. Plus, most of these folks didn‚Äôt lose their jobs/weren‚Äôt materially impacted by covid as their organizations allowed them to work remotely.

If anything, the robustness of what we‚Äôre seeing is a sign of a market that has many sectors moving in an upward trajectory. The movement has quite a bit of breadth too as it is not just concentrated to memes, ‚Äútech‚Äù, or large caps. 

I think more and more people are getting interested in investing in the stock market because it‚Äôs more accessible than ever before (free trades, fractional shares, mobile apps, etc.), it has a low barrier to entry, and it‚Äôs one of the few ways that people can imagine building a much better life for themselves. Compare this to real estate (high entry costs, hard to find great deals, and is location specific) and people end up gravitating towards the market. For folks that want higher volatility, we see them jumping into cryptocurrencies.

449,GME,"Not an expert, but a few ways I can think of are:

* Effectively price in higher implied volatility
* Use more aggressive gamma hedging strategies
* Include (or increase weighting of) ratio of short interest to effective float as a risk factor, possibly exponentially as short interest begins to approach effective float, or use a different option pricing model where the underlying has short interest (or other identified risk factors) above a threshold.
* Only offer options within a tighter band, try to close out/buy far OTM contracts to reduce exposure to tail risk
* Change hedge unwinding strategies to disperse gamma squeeze risk around contract expiry
* etc.

All of those are variations on the theme of ultimately making options more expensive in various ways.  This is counterbalanced by competition between MMs.

A MM that hedges too aggressively (and thus expensively) will be uncompetitive, but those that hedge inadequately will eventually go bankrupt.  Just like insurance agencies, they have people working constantly to try to figure out how to identify elevated tail risk situations, and how to most competitively hedge those while not necessarily increasing cost where not necessary.

If the tech/EV bubble bursts this year, it could fall by 95% and take 12 years to recover its current value.

499,GME,"If you're earning 150% on trades like GME I think that's the answer. That's now a famous trade by wsb. It's working out and I think they're going to make even more on it next week. But go through that sub and see what's been lost in the past. I consider something like that high risk/high reward. Had Microsoft and Sony decided to move away from physical game disks, GME couldve been left without a functioning business model.

Another point to consider is the goal of professional traders. Some are tasked with making money. But others are tasked with managing risk. Of course they're going to try to manage that risk as cheaply as possible and perhaps earn money as they do, but they also have to trade within certain parameters and are forced in to certain trades. See the gamma squeeze on GME last week where institutions were forced to buy shares because of the options market. They made money on that, but my point is that they were forced into the trade by retail investors.",0.088,0.839,0.073,-0.5859
500,GME,"Beyond pure risk management, there are fundamental market forces that keep professionals out of some of these high return plays. It can be somewhat easy, although it mostly depends on good luck, to find plays that will double or more your money... As long as you aren't playing with so much you cause slippage.

The kinds of trades you can execute without making a price swing wildly in one direction or the other depends on the total amount of money you are trying to move. It's somewhat related to the GME squeeze everyone is anticipating. The expected rise is in large part to the size of the position that will need to be moved through that market if/when it happens. 

When you are a pro responsible for managing hundreds of millions or more, the risk of these smaller plays isn't worth it when you can't use a significant chunk of your capital. Who cares about a 150% return on only 1% of your portfolio when you can get a much much safer 2 or 3% on the whole thing?

Ultimately, retailers who can play these high risk high reward plays are like kids picking up pennies off the street. It's a lot of money for the kid and it was somewhat low effort. And for the big shot on wall street, it isn't worth the time or effort.",0.059,0.807,0.134,0.9617
