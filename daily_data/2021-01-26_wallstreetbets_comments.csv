0,GME,"Hey r/all,

New to r/wallstreetbets? (WSB)

Long story short, u/DeepFuckingValue (DFV) posted [his GME YOLO here](https://i.redd.it/pvmj76ntgfl31.png) back in September of 2019.

He took an $50K long position and has been long ever since. That's right, he turned $50K into $13MM+, and was at almost $25MM at today's peak. (He realized some gains along the way and bought into new positions, hence the $770K cost basis)

It's not fake. Look at this submission history.

Welcome to WSB, enjoy your stay.",0.0,0.841,0.159,0.9184

To everyone who doesn’t understand GME and what’s happening. Right now, GME is the highest ever shorted stock in history. Every day that we see green, the squeeze goes on.

Today may scare a lot of you. We all saw GME shoot to 150 and back down to 75. This kind of range has never been seen before in a billion+$ company.

2 questions - why and how.

The how is easier to understand so let’s start there. Because of the short seller contracts that are currently in process cover a LARGE amount of shares from what would be the float. This means that there is less available shares for trading making the price of the stock extremely volatile. Usually when this happens to a stock a short squeeze will ensue OR the stock will just be driven to bankruptcy... which is what the fuck heads at shitron and Melvin are trying to do. With GME - we are seeing a literal historic level of support for GME. This causes the price to go up and the short sellers to have to pay out the difference of how much it’s going up directly to the people who are taking them up on their put contracts. The most known user for taking up these contracts is u/deepfuckingvalue. With the profits from these calls, our compatriots are buying more shares and contracts. This has the possibility to literally go on forever, or until the short sellers are broke and give up. In the past when this happened, the short sellers stopped because they don’t want to get squeezed out of all their money. In the case of GME, the short sellers do not think that WSB has the ability to continue what we started and they are posting more and more short contracts. This means the squeeze is still on.

I’ve touched a bit on the why... but just to be clear we are at fucking war. When you watch this stock you can literally picture the LOTR meme of a battle between already rich jackasses who want GME staff out of jobs and the Reddit buyers keeping the price above yesterday’s... every day.

Every day we see green, we are making our call contracts print us money directly from Melvin and shitron and our leaders making these calls ARE buying shares I promise you.

To participate: buy shares. Hold them until GME hits 1000 or even after that.

A squeeze of this magnitude can literally bankrupt Andrew Left. But we need to stay strong.

The short ratio compared to share float is still above 200%. This is fucking nuts, and if we stop our unified force now, they will make their money back and move on with life.

NOW, yes literally NOW. Today. Tomorrow. NOW. Is the time where we can hit them where it hurts. We need more buys after hours today, pre market tomorrow and every single fucking dip that comes up tomorrow.

We have the power right now and we will not loose it. Participate and be rich, or watch us patiently.

Best of luck my fellow retard.

JP morgan, goldman, morgan stanley all trade with Steve Cohen - their exposure could be high and bankrolling interest payments/margin on increase short buying.

Melvin capital 47% gains in 2016, 41% in 2017.  Too good to be true?  Melvin capital owns large stake in Expedia, Priceline.  Both are back to pre-covid highs despite huge hits to tourism sector; were they using GME short gains as leverage to prop up failing tourism positions? 

Did Melvin et al purchase loads of synthetic puts at low cost basis due to low open interest?

Scions GME purchases coincide with Melvin's GME puts.  Also coincides with Scion entering call contracts with JPM, GS, BOA - possible hedging on Cohen synthetic short manipulation? Is Melvin exploiting arbitrage of put-call parity?

Did Melvin et al heavily rely on conversion arbitrage strategies by selling calls with low strike prices?  Is this why they kept taking on short positions even when GME was at $3?",0.118,0.747,0.134,0.7601

164,AAPL,"I think the poster here did a great job identifying some of the (progressively more desperate) manipulation that short sellers have utilized to try to keep the price of the stock down. I think there was really good advice about holding, not risking more than you can afford to lose, and being careful to keep positive delta when you roll options. However, there are a few things here that strike me as potentially incorrect that might cause misunderstanding and an unnecessary amount of fear for bulls. 

1. Market makers don’t care which way a stock goes, they just care that they make money. Usually they do that by both buying and selling and capturing the spread. Usually if they sell a bunch of calls or stock they delta hedge by more aggressively bidding to buy stock or other calls to end up hedged. No market maker wants to end up with a substantial position either direction, especially in something as volatile as GME.

2. The change in bid-ask spread rules for options is not at all surprising or unfair given the volatility of the stock. Imagine you are the market maker, you are required to make a market no wider than $5. In normal symbols, this is not a big deal, for example in AAPL for a $1.50 option, you would have to quote no more than a few pennies wide to have any hope of getting fills. So for example, you might bid $1.48 and ask $1.51. If you quote $1.40/$1.60 all of the incoming orders will go to those closer quoting closer to $1.50. However considering a symbol like GME that is super volatile, if the stock is at $80, a deep in the money call like the $20 strike might trade a little over $60. However if you are quoting $57.50 / $62.50 and someone comes in and buys 50 calls from you at $62.50 and the stock pops up to $70 before you hedge, now you are down $38,000. No market maker wants to do that and if you don’t expand the minimum bid-ask spread that they are required to maintain, they are just going to pull out and you won’t have any liquidity. It doesn’t seem strange or concerning for the rule to have been changed for GME. If anything, it’s an indicator that market makers are really worried about the volatility and the possibility they get stuck short in a run-up.

3. Melvin running to Citadel and begging for a loan is an incredibly bullish sign. The fact that they are stretched enough means that they may have run out of capital and had no choice but to mortgage their upside and promise to hand over future profits to Citadel just to get enough money to stay liquid. If the stock keeps on closing higher each day (regardless how much vol intraday) they are at risk of a margin call and involuntary liquidation where their brokerage will buy back their position at any price. Remember, Melvin like many hedge funds, is able to leverage up much more than you or me. Not 2x or 4x, more like 15x, 20x, maybe even more. That sounds good, except when you start taking losses you burn through your capital quickly and then the margin call comes. Melvin is running scared and the only reason to publicly announce this loan/investment is to try to spook retail traders in the hopes they can close out their short at a lower price.

4. You and our comrades posting our intention to buy 50 or 100 or 1000 shares isn’t a risk. There’s nothing anyone can do to stop you from buying and if anything, posting indicates the resolve of bulls and may cause the short sellers to reconsider whether the stock is going to return to a “reasonable” price. 

I hope this helps. I don’t have $1 MM in this trade, I just bought 100 shares for fun a couple days ago when I realized this was retarded enough to actually work. But I think the short squeeze thesis is solid and I’m personally going to hold til $420.69 to see what happens.

If we win - we can do this over and over again, with more and more money. It’s dangerous to those who used to be able to control markets based on the small number of folks who understood the numbers.

Here is the ELI3 explanation. 


A call option is a contract that gives you the right to buy 100 shares of a stock for a set dollar amount, say $150. The $150 is called the strike price (ie: with strike 150). An option is a contract between you and another ""person"". The person selling you the contract does not want to be on the hook forever so he tells you when the contract will expire. Contracts usually expire on friday. So if today was Friday, you bought a 0 day contract. Now lets say you bought one contract for $20 at 9 AM and this one contract is now worth $170 at 12AM because the stock price went up to $150. You stand to make a good chunk of change, except the powers that be force a market halt by dropping the price of the stock more than 5% in 5 minute, and keep triggering the halt until 4 PM when the day ends. Your contract expired, so you cannot sell it. How would you get shares? You have to spend $150 for a share. $150 x 100 for a hundred shares, or as in the example above that uses 100 call options: $150 stock price x 100 shares/per contract x 100 call option contracts = $1,500,000 . 


Now what I need clarification on is if the option had been exercised at 11AM when the stock was $14, wouldn't the holder still have to pay $1,500,000 to purchase the 10,000 shares?",0.033,0.891,0.076,0.9004

290,GME,"they essentially are betting on GME to go down. they borrowed like tens of thousands of stocks for a fee from a brokerage, sold them off, and are expected to get the shares back to the brokerage by a certain date.

if the stock has lost value, they make money by giving back shares that cost them less than what they sold at. like, if you sell at $60 and cover your short when the price falls to $20, you're up $40 a share. since the stock is actually going up in value, they need to cover their shorts by buying at the higher price, which is directly losing money. afaik, they can push off giving the shares back, but, they incur heavy interest from the brokerage for doing so - and the price might still go up. this is why we're seeing so many major players really push this narrative that the ""squeeze is over"" and ""GME is going to plummet"" - they want to scare people into selling to drop the share price so they can get back in the green.

also, lots of short sellers dealt with their shorts on Friday by doubling down on shorts again, meaning they basically took out even riskier loans to cover their initial risky loans..

WSB is literally the little guy winning and sticking it to the elitists.  We can try to pressure politicians to make the rules fairer for the middle class, but guess what? Nothing ever changes because every politician, from dem to rep, is part of the elitist crowd.  Lowly commoners are now leveling the playing field using the system's own rules.  The hedge fund managers crying about losing on their bets trying to drive a company to $0 and cheering on 50,000 people losing their jobs can suck it. They were over levered, kicked the wrong hornet's nest this time, and must pay the price for their stupidity.  

Imagine how dumb you have to be to short a stock with already over 100% short interest just to try to gain from a stock moving from $3 to $0, with the risk that by your losses could be infinite. Idiots are deserving of every ounce of this.",0.171,0.73,0.098,-0.9625

Most DVMs aren't out to get rich, just make a decent living helping animals. Often a clinic's angel fund can make the difference in a struggling families year and alleviate some of the emotional stress that comes with that career.

Maybe some of you or most don't know that Melvin Capital heavy shorted polish blue chip CD Projekt Red - the company that created Cyberpunk 2077.

Presented screenshot shows their actual short position.

Melvin's position [https://imgur.com/3hwbRAS](https://imgur.com/3hwbRAS)

Yeah, it's huge. Even though, CDPR published nasty patch few days ago (no one is happy with that), Sony kicked off their game from the shop, and they have 2 massive law suits, moods are shit - today someone significantly was buying the stock.

Some don’t give a flying fuk about GME but see there are more shares shorted than exist so maths check out. 

Some don’t know there are more shares shorted than exist and picked a random ticker people on YouTube talked about, they will make money on GME and lose it all later. 

And that last part is important because y’all had a retard on Fast Money that went all in with 20k in UVXY calls for the election and guess what - we had those retards here too.

433,GME,"I’m repeatedly amazed at two things:

1. WSB is painted as a hive mind. What? Are you kidding? We’re just a bunch of small money retail investors. Sure, some people here have millions to throw around. But most people are relatively small time investors that revel in the failure and success of others. Maybe if we all pulled our money into one account, and had a handful of people calling shots we would be... what do you call it... a fund of some kind? 

2. WSB can manipulate the markets. When a stock is in a good position, it gets around here quick. But that happens with any investment based social media. People form thoughts, and share them. Wow! It’s not like there is an official avenue for us to broadcast our opinions... like say CNBC. 

Ultimately, we’re thousands of individuals throwing thousands of dollars against Wall Street and their billions of dollars. They have access to BETTER information, more capital, more market tools, and better platforms for spreading information. 

You done messed up and over shorted a stock to a point that some people caught wind and started locking up floating shares so that you can’t safely back out. Sucks to suck. Use this superior position available to you to try to find your way out. 

In the mean time, I think I’ll hold.

Over the weekend, most of us were  lewdly eyeing those 1/29 115c's hoping to pick them up for pennies, only  to see the stock already be at 100 at the opening bell and the options  to be ridiculously expensive.  Even at 70 bucks, they were trading at 15  dollars, when any other stock on the market, they'd be at, like...  0.08.

\-The  meteoric rise to 150 and subsequent fall back down into the 60's looked  scary, but it revealed some important information.  First, it revealed  that it takes VERY LITTLE momentum to create a death spiral upwards.   When this thing starts flying, everybody gets out of the way and the  only thing that saves them are the circuit breakers (which we had NINE  of today).  It shows how easy it is to trigger a Gamma squeeze (which is  what these last 2 giant leaps were). It also shows that, at this price,  there is VERY LITTLE sell resistance to encounter, which is why those  Shrek dicks get so big.  The psychological shock of this aside, it was  actually a GOOD thing to see it happen because it revealed that, at any  point, we can flex a little bit of muscle and send this thing into outer  space.   Just remember, that whole situation was a PURELY PSYCHOLOGICAL  EVENT.

\-Our  problem is that, unlike hedge funds, retail investors don't know what  circuit breakers are, don't know what happens when they get triggered,  and they get freaked out by them.  More importantly, they forget to  queue back up their buy orders, which is why you see them usually  trigger selling action.

\-This  shows that the squeeze hasn't squoze yet.  Look at any other big short  squeeze in history (not just VW) and you will see price action like this  just before it happens.  All this price action indicates that it's  close.

\-Most  importantly, it's showing that us leaning our chip stack against Melvin  is ABSOLUTELY working.  They didn't go to Citadel and Point72 with  their hat in hand for 2 billion dollars because they were doing really  well.  All indications point to the fact that, prior to Cit and Point  agreeing to pump money into Melvin, that Melvin was VERY close to having  its positions liquidated.  It's the guy who started a small business  going to his parents for a loan because his expenses got out of control  and he needs a float.  We have cost the hedge funds over 3 BILLION  dollars in 3 weeks by leaning on them.  They're trapped, and they know  it.  Which means if we keep leaning on them with our chipstack, we're  going to take some of these fuckers out.  Something even the ""analysts""  on CNBC and Bloomberg admitted today.  Which leads me to:

\-The  fact that ALL these talking haircuts are talking shit about us all day  long now (understanding that they're bought and paid for by big money  banks and hedge funds) and are trying to frame an emotional narrative  about how bad we are just goes to show how terrified everybody is.  Look  up the video of Cramer talking to David Faber earlier ([https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/smallbusiness/jim-cramer-on-gamestops-jump-higher/vi-BB1d4sjJ](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/smallbusiness/jim-cramer-on-gamestops-jump-higher/vi-BB1d4sjJ)).   Look how disgusted Faber looks throughout the clip, and the amount of  disdain he has that a bunch of plebes are challenging his superior  genetics.   Turn off the volume, and you'd think that somebody just  sprayed a skunk at his face.  Then go look at the midday report that  Cramer hopped on over during the Halftime Report ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVql5X44Pk&feature=emb\_logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVql5X44Pk&feature=emb_logo),  though I don't think this clip has the part I'm about to talk about).   Look how fucking HAPPY the host gets when he gets to say that GME is  ""down 6%"".  Look at how all the analysts start off angry that GME is up,  and how relieved they look when it momentarily goes red.  Notice also  that they don't say shit when it jumped back up 11% 2 minutes later.   This is a coordinated attack of the media by command of the ruling  elites to try and denigrate what we're doing.  Sure, it scared off some  paper handed bitches today, but we can't count on them anyways.

TL:DR:   Keep holding the line.  Keep beating at the gate.  Keep chipping away  at them.  We've got them.  Hold strong and its  🚀🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀🚀   🚀🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀🚀   for everybody.

As  for tomorrow?  Just like every day on this crazy roller coaster, it's  anybody's guess.  But looking at the trend, it very much looks like  we're going to gap up hard, consolidate 2-3 times during the day, and  continue our trend of higher highs and higher lows.  If that's wrong,  expect a pull back to the mid-high 60's, which should be an entry point  for you, because there's strong support there.

If  you bought in too high today, look to average down.   It'll work out  for you.  If you're already deep in the green, just chill, motherfucker,  the wolf is on his way.",0.105,0.795,0.101,-0.8503

Alright animals, I am here to offer some comfort in these trying times. The TLDR of this is - HOLD, this is the bumpy, exciting, volatile beginning of our tendie launch.

The avalanche of actual idiots selling because of circuit breakers and bad articles and whatnot is 10/10 retarded. There’s no reason you can’t hold. I get that some of you have never had gains so high (shit, I haven’t - I could’ve had a heart attack because of premarket gains) but the fact of the matter is, if you HOLD now, you will BENEFIT later.

This is a shout out to the real gods in WSB holding the goddamn line and seeing through the scare tactics. We all need to have DFV hands up in here. Don’t be the guy that got scared of a little loss. Don’t sell your positions. You’ll regret it one day.

There’s still shorts to squeeze, guys. It isn’t over. Hold on tight, and actually believe. Go take a walk. Pet a dog. Cook some food. For fucks sake, go do something other than stress about shit you can’t change - highs and lows are going to happen whether you’re staring at your phone or not.

Take a break, kings and queens. Rest up. The war isn’t over. Don’t fuckin sell, and if you do, don’t bitch when GME hits the hundreds.

599,GME,"there is no dump. GME isn't rising on a pump and dump, it's rising on a short squeeze and a gamma squeeze. hedge funds who shorted GME are the unironic version of ""price hits x and the shotgun goes off"" meme on a massive scale right now.

first there is the market makers, who sell call options. every single call option on GME expired in the money last week, which meant market makers had to buy a huge amount of shares to cover the calls they sold. they issued new options today and when gamestop crossed 115 every new option was already in the money because 115 was the highest strike based on 2x last closing. but that's just a small part of the squeeze.

the big squeeze is the hedge funds that are short game stop. right now they're literally being held hostage by gamestop shareholders. some of them have probably already been effectively blown up. melvin capital has a big short position and only has $7 billion assets under management.

there's not going to be anything like a ""GME bagholder"" right now current holders have the hedge funds, their parent companies, and then eventually the investment banks which act as prime brokers for those companies under hostage. they decide the price they have to pay to get out from the squeeze.

theoretically gamestop could reach a $1 trillion market cap end of week if shareholders refuse to sell. small funds which had a short position like melvin are probably already effectively blown up if they didn't close out their short position, their liability will pass on to their parent company. if the parent company blows up now their bank has a problem. if GME holders refuse to sell, the bank could theoretically get liquidated as well. i don't even know what happens after that. it's an unprecedented event.

600,GME,"The psychology of stocks:

See it rise quickly to $159: FOMO buy, thinking it will smoothly rise to $420 

See it drop to $66: Freak out and either sell or pray it goes up a little bit so you can either break even or only take a small loss

Slow rise to $115: “I’ve been holding this for so long, better sell now while I have the chance”

It’s why institutions make money and people like us lose the game.

Don’t buy GME if you can’t handle volatility. But if you do buy all you have to do afterwards is... literally nothing, just hold.",0.089,0.839,0.071,-0.2551

I didn't sell today. I  saw my truck being paid off and a good chunk of my house. I saw a year of living expenses and getting ahead on my student loans.

I didn't sell today. I've paper handed this stock two times at $13 and $41 to pay bills with little profit. Never did I think that I would be fortunate enough to actually get ahead in life by making a good financial decision against the whales.

Today, I saw the gates of Valhalla. Today, for the first time I felt like I was the one beating the system. A system that has fucked me and my family more times than I could count. Fuck the shorts. GME to Mars 🚀🚀🚀

You will get your fucking face ripped off and then will have no money left to get in at lower price points. Nobody times it right, that’s why we’re retarded. 
4.	⁠BE RETARDED, BUT DONT BE FUCKING STUPID!!!!!! This is exhilarating and all and could be very profitable, but don’t bite off what you can’t chew. The reason the shorts R Fuk Is because they did the exact same thing. But unlike your peasant ass, they have financial institutions they can borrow from when they fuxk up that will bail them out. You are sleeping on a dog bed outside your master bedroom. Do NOT risk rent payments, children’s education, grandmas surgery money on this stupid gamble. Buying stocks will already limit what you can lose, and we do have some favorable factors behind us, but it’s still a gamble

TLDR: STAY CALM, DONT SELL, BUY IN CHUNKS, DONT RISK YOUR LIFE

There’s no such thing as free money, this is going to be an arm wrestling match, but never underestimate the power of weaponized autism in numbers.

So pull up your big boy pants, smarten the fuck up, and let’s go out there and fuk these bears in the mouth!!!!

Shorts recognize that we're almost all into our positions now. The outstanding float that isn't held by us is in their possession minus a few defectors on our side and 5-10% held by others. They are going to do EVERYTHING in their power to bring this down. ""Like what?"" you may ask...

1. Bot brigade negative sentiment on social media, reddit, etc. (this has yet to be common and could be more prevalent soon - though I have seen some new made accounts posting negative sentiment on GME)

2. Buying up the shares we don't have, driving up the price...
a) Hoping to create more liquidity for them by reducing our shares (more defectors as price goes up). 
b) So they can accumulate shares and manufacture large sell offs on volume to create what we saw earlier today

3. Persuade investors on reddit, social media, etc. that there are other better things to buy that will fuck shorts. Yes, there are plenty. But they want to spread us thin. BB, AMC, etc. are just the beginning. If we sell some of our shares to allocate to these and more that will be mentioned over the next couple weeks, we will lose. We will lose not only our strength in GME, but our strength in any focus of any short squeeze.

We will be tested and this will not be easy.

780,GME,"To the paperhands and newbros joining us. To those who joined us at a high this morning. To those who are losing money because they joined us at 150. Here's what you want to know. Here's what you need to know.

&#x200B;

GME was at 37.50 when I bought in. Everyone laughed outside of WSB. No way it can even breach 50 before it falls down to 20 they said. I had a limit sell ready at 50$ for my 7 shares. I was so nervous as I watched it fall to 36. Then jump to 40. Then back down to 37. Then back up to 48. My heartrate jumped up and down with it. I cancelled my limit sell order. I learned within those 15 minutes that this is WSB. This is where dreams are fulfilled. And if you want to win, you must have DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS.

&#x200B;

That was on January 20th (5 days ago). Then on Friday I was finally able to tear myself from my slave wage work and looked at the ticker again. And oh how my heart went up and down. I saw the stock rise to 75. I was close to putting in another limit order for 60 and be done with it. But then I recalled. DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS.

&#x200B;

And again over the weekend I hear it's all over. It's about time for it to crash and leave the muppet users on WSB penniless while the mods who are running this scam make off with their haul. I watched proudly at the propaganda as my hands didn't move. I continued on with my day as my heart didn't even flutter. And this morning we hit 150 and we're still steady at 80 WHICH IS ALREADY MORE THAN LAST WEEK'S RECORD FUCKING HIGH.

&#x200B;

So they said it won't make it back to 50, sell. They said it won't make it back to 60, sell. They said it won't make it back to 70, sell. We broke 50. We broke 60. We broke 70. Today your hearts and those short selling un-American sons of bitches banking on an American company failing are screaming ""It won't make it back to 100, sell"". And you turn to WSB as this is where it all began for you. You look for help. You look for a sign. Here's your answer.

Today may scare a lot of you. We all saw GME shoot to 150 and back down to 75. This kind of range has never been seen before in a billion+$ company. 

2 questions - why and how. 

The how is easier to understand so let’s start there. Because of the short seller contracts that are currently in process cover a LARGE amount of shares from what would be the float. This means that there is less available shares for trading making the price of the stock extremely volatile. Usually when this happens to a stock a short squeeze will ensue OR the stock will just be driven to bankruptcy... which is what the fuck heads at shitron and Melvin are trying to do. 
With GME - we are seeing a literal historic level of support for GME. This causes the price to go up and the short sellers to have to pay out the difference of how much it’s going up directly to the people who are taking them up on their put contracts. The most known user for taking up these contracts is u/deepfuckingvalue. With the profits from these calls, our compatriots are buying more shares and contracts. This has the possibility to literally go on forever, or until the short sellers are broke and give up. In the past when this happened, the short sellers stopped because they don’t want to get squeezed out of all their money. In the case of GME, the short sellers do not think that WSB has the ability to continue what we started and they are posting more and more short contracts. This means the squeeze is still on. 

I’ve touched a bit on the why... but just to be clear we are at fucking war. When you watch this stock you can literally picture the LOTR meme of a battle between already rich jackasses who want GME staff out of jobs and the Reddit buyers keeping the price above yesterday’s... every day. 

Every day we see green, we are making our call contracts print us money directly from Melvin and shitron and our leaders making these calls ARE buying shares I promise you. 

To participate: buy shares. Hold them until GME hits 1000 or even after that. 

A squeeze of this magnitude can literally bankrupt Andrew Left. But we need to stay strong. 

The short ratio compared to share float is still above 200%. This is fucking nuts, and if we stop our unified force now, they will make their money back and move on with life. 


NOW, yes literally NOW. Today. Tomorrow. NOW. Is the time where we can hit them where it hurts. We need more buys after hours today, pre market tomorrow and every single fucking dip that comes up tomorrow.

My  fellow fellows, I have an anxiety disorder and know first hand how  freaking out about stuff irrationally can fuck you up, so please read on  for a physiological look at how to protect your hard-earned tendies in  the coming skirmishes.

After the  last few days in GME (I bought shares last week and am diamond holding),  I feel like trading is a contact sport - I'm wired and tired at the  same time and feel kinda sick and exhilarated.

Some  of what is causing this is our monkey brains squirting adrenaline into  our bodies every time the price moves. Our heart rates spike and we  sweat. Our fight or flight response is activated. THIS IS GREAT IS  ANDREW LEFT JUST KICKED IN YOUR DOOR AND TRIES TO MAKE YOU SELL YOUR GME  SHARES, BUT NOT SO GOOD WHEN ALL YOU ARE DOING IS WATCHING NUMBERS ON A  SCREEN.

Long periods of  adrenaline without an actual physical threat play havoc with you body  and brain. If you do this long enough (and we might be on the battle  field with these fucking boomers for weeks or more) you risk not  thinking clearly and/or becoming too anxious and can become depressed.

Know  that your physical well-being will help you deal with this situation  and keep you mind clear and able to deal with stress. Below are some  ways to manage your stress for the oncoming shenanigans;

* Watch  your caffeine intake - caffeine increases adrenaline production. If you  are already in a wired state, even your regular caffeine intake can  make you jittery and fuck with your ability to focus and think.
* Keep  hydrated - adrenaline and stress hormones zap your kidneys, so drink  plenty of fluids (not your own piss you fucking retards) to help your  body process everything.
* Keep  your vices in check, be it drinking, smoking blah blah blah - your body  has enough to worry about right now so try keep shit in moderation
* Do  something physical - even a walk around the block or a lap around your  workplace or home will help calm you. Same goes for getting some fresh  air and sunlight. Go sit near some greenery (A japanese study has shown  that stress levels lower when we hang out a round trees and shit for a  while) Play with a pet.
* Care  for each other when posting  - This whole GME thing is changing  people's lives. Emotions are charged. Lets support each other and keep  things positive in posts. People are allowed to disagree - a dissenting  opinion is a gift that makes you see things from a different POV.
* **Be  careful who you listen to - this one is the flipside of the point  above. Not every opinion on here or out in the news is coming from a  reliable source. Some are innocently wrong and some are purposefully  trying to spread fear or manipulate this sub like the institutions  manipulate the market. Do your own DD. The mods do a great job (from  what I can see) of removing bullshitters and shill posters, but be  aware.**

My  fellow fellows, I have an anxiety disorder and know first hand how  freaking out about stuff irrationally can fuck you up, so please read on  for a physiological look at how to protect your hard-earned tendies in  the coming skirmishes.

After the  last few days in GME (I bought shares last week and am diamond holding),  I feel like trading is a contact sport - I'm wired and tired at the  same time and feel kinda sick and exhilarated.

Some  of what is causing this is our monkey brains squirting adrenaline into  our bodies every time the price moves. Our heart rates spike and we  sweat. Our fight or flight response is activated. THIS IS GREAT IS  ANDREW LEFT JUST KICKED IN YOUR DOOR AND TRIES TO MAKE YOU SELL YOUR GME  SHARES, BUT NOT SO GOOD WHEN ALL YOU ARE DOING IS WATCHING NUMBERS ON A  SCREEN.

Long periods of  adrenaline without an actual physical threat play havoc with you body  and brain. If you do this long enough (and we might be on the battle  field with these fucking boomers for weeks or more) you risk not  thinking clearly and/or becoming too anxious and can become depressed.

Know  that your physical well-being will help you deal with this situation  and keep you mind clear and able to deal with stress. Below are some  ways to manage your stress for the oncoming shenanigans;

* Watch  your caffeine intake - caffeine increases adrenaline production. If you  are already in a wired state, even your regular caffeine intake can  make you jittery and fuck with your ability to focus and think.
* Keep  hydrated - adrenaline and stress hormones zap your kidneys, so drink  plenty of fluids (not your own piss you fucking retards) to help your  body process everything.
* Keep  your vices in check, be it drinking, smoking blah blah blah - your body  has enough to worry about right now so try keep shit in moderation
* Do  something physical - even a walk around the block or a lap around your  workplace or home will help calm you. Same goes for getting some fresh  air and sunlight. Go sit near some greenery (A japanese study has shown  that stress levels lower when we hang out a round trees and shit for a  while) Play with a pet.
* Care  for each other when posting  - This whole GME thing is changing  people's lives. Emotions are charged. Lets support each other and keep  things positive in posts. People are allowed to disagree - a dissenting  opinion is a gift that makes you see things from a different POV.
* **Be  careful who you listen to - this one is the flipside of the point  above. Not every opinion on here or out in the news is coming from a  reliable source. Some are innocently wrong and some are purposefully  trying to spread fear or manipulate this sub like the institutions  manipulate the market. Do your own DD. The mods do a great job (from  what I can see) of removing bullshitters and shill posters, but be  aware.**

A little basic math.


There are 69.75M shares of $GME outstanding.


Short interest is more than 130%. 


Short-sellers are paying an annual rate of 32.7% for the privilege of having done so. 


Let's keep it simple and say that bears have shorted 100M shares of $GME.


Let's estimate the average short sale was at $40. 


Based on this math, that interest is owed on $4 BILLION. 


On an annual basis, the shorts will be paying $1.308 BILLION annually on these short sales.


The market is open M-F with a few holidays here and there - about 250 days per year. 


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $5 million per market day.


The market is open 7.5 hours per day.  


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $700,000 per hour.


There are 60 minutes in an hour.


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $12,000 per minute.


There are 60 seconds in a minute.


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $194 per second. 


---


Sit back and think about.  Count to ten.  That's $1,940 that you just cost those short-sellers.  And it cost you literally nothing. 


Go take a cigarette break.  Ten minutes.  That's another $120,000 you cost those fuckers.


Now hide your phone.  Get so drunk that you pass out and don't come to until the market's closed.  Two more hours.  $1.4 million down the drain for those faithless pukes.

To the paper hands selling, I strongly suggest you research ""Short Squeeze"" and also research whats happening with GME and similar. Big money buying puts (puts are a loan), they HAVE to buy the stock in the future. That increases the number of buyers, which is literally making everyone holding the stock richer.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but if every individual here says GME is going to 400 and no one sells until it gets there, the big money gets f'ed. the short sellers get squeezed out and along the way which speeds up the run to get us to 400.

863,GME,"**REMINDER:** We only need 3 days with movement like today to get to 1000.

Today's peak was a 150% increase over Friday and the squeeze hasn't even started. If the squeeze starts, we can assume the days will end closer to the day peak because of the upward trajectory as shorts continue to unwind.

80-200 = 150% 

200-500 = 150% 

500-1250 = 150%

If the squeeze begins, a 150% increase is going to be easy, considering it happened without the squeeze even starting.
 
Day 1: 80-200 

Day 2: 200-500 

Day 3: 500-1250

Alright animals, I am here to offer some comfort in these trying times. The TLDR of this is - HOLD, this is the bumpy, exciting, volatile beginning of our tendie launch.

The avalanche of actual idiots selling because of circuit breakers and bad articles and whatnot is 10/10 retarded. There’s no reason you can’t hold. I get that some of you have never had gains so high (shit, I haven’t - I could’ve had a heart attack because of premarket gains) but the fact of the matter is, if you HOLD now, you will BENEFIT later.

This is a shout out to the real gods in WSB holding the goddamn line and seeing through the scare tactics. We all need to have DFV hands up in here. Don’t be the guy that got scared of a little loss. Don’t sell your positions. You’ll regret it one day.

There’s still shorts to squeeze, guys. It isn’t over. Hold on tight, and actually believe. Go take a walk. Pet a dog. Cook some food. For fucks sake, go do something other than stress about shit you can’t change - highs and lows are going to happen whether you’re staring at your phone or not.

Volume of GME on Friday was 197M. Record breaking. Let’s go back again to the available

traded 5 times. There’s just no possible way every available share was traded 5 times. I know

923,CB,"Hey All, few thoughts from the day:

Melvin got bailed out to the tune of $2.75billion. They've decided to fight a money fire (their money) by throwing more money on it. Shareholders just need to sit back, wait, roast some marshmellows, and not sell. That turns into a painful and hefty interest payment for them.

If that spike to $150 today was a gradual cover and then reshorting (which I suspect it may have been) - we only need to look at the last margin/squeeze when the price his 70 and dropped back down. That means the next price target might run up to $300 (holy shit) before we hit another margin call/cover/squeeze back down - because it seems like they are willing to lose 100% of their short position before they even think about covering.

1. That is obviously unsustainable.
2. They could have given up today at $150. They chose not to. Keep that in mind.

If the price holds above 80 by the end of the week, a whopping 81,400 contracts (Source: Fidelity Open Interest) will exercise ITM, dealing another gamma like squeeze we saw friday/monday. If it goes higher than $115 - it could be nuclear liftoff at that point. I had no idea what to expect on monday (today) - but I didn't expect 90's when I woke up for premarket.

The volatility will get insane. Strap in, hold on to your butts, because (i posted about this earlier) - this could be a long, drawn out battle. If shares are as unavailable as everyone is reporting, Melvin and co will cotinue to gamblers fallacy their money straight into retail pockets.

Pos: 1100 shares CB.36, 28 contracts all deep ITM (25-52 strike).edit: not advice, I'm holding, do as you please.  


Edit: Also - Melvin's shareholders are in a three year lockout agreement - meaning they can't pull their money until he says so, or it goes to 0. There may be some other terms, obviously I'm not privy to the contract, but that 3 year lock-in is widely reported. That means, depending on how stupid they want to be, being down 30% already on the year (4 BILLION DOLLARS) - they have another $8billion to go AUM, AND the $2.75 billion Citadel loan.",0.057,0.885,0.058,0.0258

966,DD,"Today’s GME Action Explained

Today was less a short squeeze and more a continuation of the Gamma Squeeze we experienced on Friday. Lots of other DD regarding that, but a lot of it has to do with the clearinghouse and share settlements that all happened today.

Look for next week to potentially repeat this as Thursday and Friday, investors will probably pile into $115c 0DTE options and will cause a similar gamma squeeze.

This is unrelated to the impending short squeeze, but I am curious what level of a gamma squeeze would trigger the margin calls that ultimately trigger the short squeeze.

No financial advice here. Just sharing thoughts.

If you held through today, it was glorious and painful. I saw money I never thought I’d see and then I lost it all the same.

I’m strong in my convictions with Ryan Cohen and I will continue to hold the line.

I had made about $25k for the day and then decided to go back in at around $151 for a quick scalp. That didn't work and as soon as it started dipping I put in a market order that was only partially filled. 

Long story short I lost my gains for the day and then got back in at $117 then held strong as I saw my total account slide to $3k LOL. I was literally sick to my stomach and almost shitting myself. I almost cried lol. 

I closed the day at a portfolio value of around $20k down about $18k for the day overall. I watched my entire life savings go from around $60k to $3k in about an hour. 

&#x200B;

The moral of the story.. don't be a retard and go 2x margin on such a volatile position. AND don't sell hold the fuck on and moon or get wiped out. If I have an opportunity tomorrow I will close all of my margin and stick only to cash.

TL;DR at the bottom for those of you who can't read.

Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders. It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC. That's the same citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital. Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on.

Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. WE'RE WINNING.

We saw this stop loss tactic yesterday, and it will happen again today, and the rest of the week too.

TL;DR: GET RID OF YOUR FUCKING STOP LOSSES, OR WE WILL NEVER REACH VALHALLA.

1450,GME,"I salute this post! This GME bidding war is literally capitalism at its finest. It's going to come down to the players, just like in the old days. Markets will pretty much pay anything as this goes down, potentially ludicrous amounts of money.

&#x200B;

I think the way it's going to play out is that big players are in the options, having liquidated any shares today, and yoloed down on calls. Little guy shareholders will be the only people with shares that are capable of being traded, other than the algorithms. Algorithms will shakedown paper hands and then melt up will start in full.

&#x200B;

Then we will be standing on the trade floor, amongst the ledgends such as dfv, holding the very last tradable shares. Everything is leveraged to infinity, and one by one, people sell. They will sell their lot and move on to a better life. Diamond hands will be the only thing remaining. 

&#x200B;

At this point shorts will regroup and will try one last charge. Diamond hands prevail. The entire process will start over again, with whoever was dumb enough to short being the first casualty. Diamond hands prevail through a margin call. Eventually we sell, one by one, until everything winds back down and normal trading takes place again. None of us lose because diamond ape crew bought under $100, and it may settle at multiples of that!

&#x200B;

Market makers pay us in this transaction from all the tendies we gave them from shorts. This is how infinite gamma works. That's how we win, shorties lose, and market makers also win, that's how the books balance.

&#x200B;

If we hold long, the price will stick. Before today I thought fair market might be $100. Now I think it's literally up to whatever we want it to be, $1000 is not out of the realm of possibility. Just diamond hand to infinity and the price will never come down. When Cohen wants to do a stock split, diamond hand more, price will only go up! DUH! 🚀🦍

&#x200B;

Don't forget. This isn't market manipulation, not by a long shot. This is a shareholder transaction between shareholders who own stock, like myself, and buyers who want to buy our shares. Name your price. 

&#x200B;

I'm not telling anyone what to do, just sharing my theory about how the transaction works. Whatever you own, stocks or options, they are yours and you are free to hop off this eternal rocket any time.",0.039,0.802,0.159,0.9934

It didn't last long.
On Wednesday 29, Porsche, perhaps realising their actions had caused some damage, generously provided an extra 5 per cent of the shares to the stricken shorts. By Friday, Volkswagen's ordinaries closed at €497, down 50 per cent from the Tuesday highs as the squeeze loosened.

1893,RC,"Belief. And the thing stopping this squeeze is shorts unwinding. 

Cramer stated this afternoon that shorts were still around 140% of the float. While I’ve heard the the total float has shrunk, which would mean the total number of shares being shorted has gone down, so has the availability of shares at the current price range.

Also the gamma squeeze we saw last Friday happens again this Friday if prices hold as funds move to cover the calls. 

If you look beyond the short squeeze, the bull thesis I’ve seen the most is that with the potential new direction as an e-commerce company, valuation of the company using the formula similar to other similar kinds of companies (multiples of the revenue instead of halting the revenue/driving primarily from profit) $160+ stock price isn’t out of the question. Now this plan hasn’t been presented, so it’s based off of some assumptions on what Ryan Cohen might do (based on his past) and gme accepting the plan.

I think 160 seems high, but a base price of 60-80 seems reasonable in the near term if revenue holds or grows(find that out in a few weeks) and RC has a plan (that gets accepted). If that doesn’t come to fruition, Andrew Lefts prediction of $20 seems reasonable.

Unfortunately FDs are only going to work like they did on Friday on other expiration days.

If GME holders don't panic sell, and we manage to keep the price constantly above 50, ideally in the triple digits. Then a short squeeze will occur. If it occurs, we'll most likely see at least 2-4x from where it starts. If the majority of people hold during the beginning of the squeeze, hitting 1000 isn't nearly as unreasonable as it sounds. 

I think people have to reconsider how they think of gme ATM. Don't think of the value, just think of the short interest, who's holding and are they paper hand bitches or diamond hand gods. 


P.S. an additional variable would be gme board allowing their preferred shares to bought etc etc.

GME Marketcap spikes HIGH in the months and year after each new console release cycle. Lots of tradeins of old consoles, buys, activity, new games etc.

Stock buybacks mean that the bare stock price was much much lower than it should be compared to previous market cap spikes - previous market cap was $9B and $6B after each console cycle, and lying at $0.3B when he bought. It was a grossly undervalued stock with a new high cycle coming up and lots of shorts.

Have a look at the marketcap/share price charts.

So he bet on this console cycle being the same. And won. He probably would have won big even without all the lucky stuff - ryan cohen, short squeeze etc.

And then crazy shit happened on top - Ryan Cohen, Short Squeeze etc and his winnings went from a 'win' to 'launch him to the moon'",0.089,0.823,0.087,0.17

Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders. It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC. That's the same Citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital.

Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade and other brokerages to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.

""Chicago-based Citadel Securities accounts for 40 of every 100 shares traded by individual investors in the US, making it the number one retail market maker, according to Piper Sandler. The company is a big buyer of customer trades from the leading US retail brokerages such as Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, which have slashed commissions to zero to keep up with fast-growing challengers such as Robinhood."" https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on. That's why the stock suddenly went from $150 to $80 in the space of an hour.

Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. WE'RE WINNING.

We saw this stop loss tactic yesterday, and it will happen again today, and the rest of the week too.

>Close-out purchases of stock will not necessarily drive up prices of  such stocks. One of the primary purposes of Regulation SHO is to clean  up open fail positions, but not to cause short squeezes. The term “short  squeeze” refers to the pressure on short sellers to cover their  positions as a result of sharp price increases or difficulty in  borrowing the security the sellers are short. The rush by short sellers  to cover produces additional upward pressure on the price of the stock,  which then can cause an even greater squeeze. **Although some short  squeezes may occur naturally in the market, a scheme to manipulate the  price or availability of stock in order to cause a short squeeze is  illegal.**

Insider trading and group trading we can safely throw out. But false information and false demand? This thread has become 99% people pushing for others to buy and hold GME. Anyone who voices otherwise has been getting downvoted to oblivion (probably this comment too). Yea, it’s probably fine, but it’s definitely not 100% innocent either. It’s very, very easy to find threads and comments saying that WSB collectively pushed the price up. News articles definitely have been quoting many things here. WSB has officially been identified by the media as the group that propped up GME today.

People simply saw this and thought they were hella dumb for being that greedy. If the company didn’t go banko the stock would HAVE to go back up. Pretty simple really. 

Cramer’s sidekick mentions the ‘08 housing market implosion and somehow draws a parallel painting investors and the homeowners as the bad guys. Do you know who really caused that housing market crash? I’ll give you a hint: it wasn’t the homeowners. It was the financial lenders aka banks. They gave out fucking NINJA loans. That stands for No Income, No Job, Approved loans. Those NINJA loans had Balloon and ARM interest rates attached to them. As an example say a balloon apr starts at 3%. After three years the string gets cut on that balloon apr and it floats into the stratosphere of 20%. ARM aprs are Adjustable Rate Mortgages. Those take a tiered approach from. 3% to 7% then 12% then 18%. Typically in a 30 year fixed home loan the first HALF of the life of the loan aka 15 years is spent paying interest. Not in these examples. Wanna know the super fucked up part of what happened? As many homeowners know if the homeowner doesn’t put down a large chuck of money in the beginning of the loan they have to pay for mortgage insurance. Mortgage insurance coverage is ONLY for the bank in case the homeowner defaults on their loan. It covers the banks loss if that happens. Now lets say banks gave out horrible loans they KNEW homeowners would default on, probably after exactly three years when all those horrid balloon and ARM interest rates go sky high. Why do that? Well, the bank is covered by the mortgage insurance for the whole loan minus what was already paid by the homeowner. Then the home is put up for auction. Here’s the really shitty part. At the auction a rep from the bank will most definitely be there and do their best to buy that property back at a much lower price than what it’s worth. Then they can sell it again for a huge profit. Does any of this sound familiar? Kinda like shorting a stock? I’d say numbnuts drew a pretty fucking accurate parallel but not in the way he wanted to.",0.085,0.848,0.067,-0.723

Some airlines weren't doing well before the pandemic so I can see this point for them, but if our government wants businesses to shut down temporarily or operate at below profitable capacity in order to stem the spread of the disease then our government owes a bit to the businesses to get them to do it.

Sure, we could just go fire and brimstone on anyone not following the law but that will just push the business owners into the black market like a speakeasy and/or get business owners to follow the letter of the law and not the spirit (see outdoor dining in NYC inside of temporary structures.)

Basically, there is a difference between a business failing due to market forces because people don't want to visit their business due to the pandemic and a business failing because the government is forcing them to shut down.",0.108,0.833,0.059,-0.7556

Somehow, this play makes it feel like we're getting something that we're **owed**.

Common sentiment is that buying GME is somehow a punch back against all the overdraft fees, usury interest rates and unfair pay that have plagued tens of millions for decades. The fact that the hill we're fighting for is a company that brought many Millenials and Zoomers cherished childhood memories is icing on the cake. Gen X, you're cool too.

2424,GME,"

I’ve been trading for around 2 years now. And trading like a retard for about 2 months. I’ve made more as a retard than as not. 

There are some things about GME I can’t wrap my head around.

1. But there’s something about GME I can’t wrap my head around. If there are ~70,000,000 shorted shares in the market, then what’s to say millions of these shares haven’t been covered that helped to cause today’s run-up? Would it not easily be diluted into the nearly 200,000,000 trading volume? Since Citadel chose to “bail out” with 3 billion dollars, is this not a red flag in the retard world? Melvin has around 10 million (of the 70 mil) shorted shares. Is it so unlikely that they offloaded these positions during the 65->150 run up? And that they loaded up more short positions or hedge their losses with puts? Citadel is not dumb, they are a force when it comes to capital and have insider info on robinhood trades. they also have interest in keeping shorts alive because they have current GME positions. So the question is: Is citadel just going the throw away 3 billion dollars? Or is there another tactic at play here? 

am having a hard time trying to grasp it. I don’t know how citadel can just throw away 3 billion like that without a tactic, i doubt they can make it back solely on increased volume and ask/buy spreads via robin hood. 

2. I also see all these comments saying “the squeeze hasn’t started yet” or “shorts haven’t covered yet” or “shorted shares are more than 100%” but where are they getting this info? i thought it wasn’t released yet? How do they know shorts have not been slowly covering over the period of a couple of months? 

3. Another problem I’m having with these newbies posts that they are comparing gme to volkswagen graph. How in what way are these graphs similar??? Yes I understand a short squeeze is happening but if you compare it to volkswagen then a squeeze has already happened. Volkswagen climbed ~200$->1000$ nearly 500%. GME has climbed from 40$->160$ nearly 400%. Even 800% if you started at 20$. So in their definition, how have they considered a squeeze has not happened yet? 

side note: more puts were bought than calls in today’s trading. 

I am not trying to place doubt in anyones mind. I just want more confirmation bias and i’m sure a lot of newbies on here do too (those that bought at 100+). Today has been a fucking rollercoaster and i hit 6 digits for the first time and back down to 50k. Can someone enlighten me about the points i’ve made. If anything comments would make people feel better about their positions. Be an alchemist and turn some paper hands into diamonds.

2454,GME,"Great comment. Some of these we can't know. I would love a complete answer. Here's my understanding on a few things:

Short interest, I believe was updated on Friday and still confirmed to be near 140% (I could be mistaken). But I've never seen any metric on what the average short price is. At these levels we'll continue to attract new shorts on the way up so no surprise if it stays high. But the average entry point really tells the story on continued squeeze potential.

>Yes I understand a short squeeze is happening but if you compare it to volkswagen then a squeeze has already happened. Volkswagen climbed ~200$->1000$ nearly 500%. GME has climbed from 40$-
160$ nearly 400%. Even 800% if you started at 20$. So in their definition, how have they considered a squeeze has not happened yet?

For some reason I thought this squeeze was more like 5000% vs 500%. Definitely something to consider.

At the end of the day the squeeze potential ends once shorts exit their positions. If there enough people holding with conviction and enough people attempting to enter it will go up at any given moment.",0.021,0.901,0.078,0.8782
2455,GME,"1.	Yes, those shorted shares could have been traded to close the short position. In some cases, the shorters may be trading their shares to other shorts. We don’t know.
2.	People saying “the squeeze hasn’t happened yet” are idiots. We are in the short squeeze right now and I believe we have been in one for a year or more. Short interest on this stock has been elevated forever, and short squeezes are a *process*, not an event. You can purchase up to date short interest data, which confirms that indeed people are still short and the cost to borrow shares is getting more expensive by the day. 
3.	Comparing to the VW squeeze is dumb as the market conditions around both were very different. Instead of WSB and Cohen holding most of the long positions in GME, for VW it was Porsche holding most of the shares. They didn’t want to be seen as being petty towards the shorts, so they let it run a bit before effectively cutting a deal with the short sellers. In this case, we have a hedge fund with very deep pockets fighting against a bunch of idiots with ungodly risk tolerance... so it could go on a while.

Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders. It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC. That's the same citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital.

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on.

1) Yesterday's MC short position [https://imgur.com/3hwbRAS](https://imgur.com/3hwbRAS)

2) Significant huge volume on CDPR 01/25/ [https://imgur.com/gallery/zvZ2olR](https://imgur.com/gallery/zvZ2olR)

3) Today, they definitely have to shorten more (now, 13:24 GMT+1 volume is close to yesterdays) 

[https://stooq.pl/q/?s=cdr](https://stooq.pl/q/?s=cdr)

**What does it mean?** 

1) Cash from yesterday will be available on 01/27 (T+2)

2) Cash from today will be available 01/28

3) Likely, MC's going to buy back the shares tomorrow.

TLTR: Even though they've got cash from Citadel, the accumulating money on Fridays battle.

TLTR3: i'm not a financial advisor, but if you bored you can go the GME in order to buy shitty cyberpunk for your's wife boyfriend.",0.1,0.851,0.05,-0.8654

Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders. It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC. That's the same Citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital.

Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade and other brokerages to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.

""Chicago-based Citadel Securities accounts for 40 of every 100 shares traded by individual investors in the US, making it the number one retail market maker, according to Piper Sandler. The company is a big buyer of customer trades from the leading US retail brokerages such as Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, which have slashed commissions to zero to keep up with fast-growing challengers such as Robinhood."" https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on. That's why the stock suddenly went from $150 to $80 in the space of an hour.

Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. WE'RE WINNING.

We saw this stop loss tactic yesterday, and it will happen again today, and the rest of the week too.

TL;DR: GET RID OF YOUR FUCKING STOP LOSSES, OR WE WILL NEVER REACH VALHALLA.

From a comment below: Ok, retards, GME General here. Listen up, because this is important.

TL;DR at the bottom for those of you who can't read.

Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders. It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC. That's the same citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital. Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on.

Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. WE'RE WINNING.

We saw this stop loss tactic yesterday, and it will happen again today, and the rest of the week too.

From a comment below: Ok, retards, GME General here. Listen up, because this is important.

TL;DR at the bottom for those of you who can't read.

Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders. It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC. That's the same citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital. Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on.

Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. WE'RE WINNING.

If you want to grow money, you buy and hold. 

Growing money is a perfectly viable strategy and you will probably get rich slow if you find a good company with good long term growth prospects. 

But this is a casino, we don't care about the long term characteristics of a company. All we care about is how quickly we can double our money.

Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders. It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC. That's the same Citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital.

Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade and other brokerages to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.

""Chicago-based Citadel Securities accounts for 40 of every 100 shares traded by individual investors in the US, making it the number one retail market maker, according to Piper Sandler. The company is a big buyer of customer trades from the leading US retail brokerages such as Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, which have slashed commissions to zero to keep up with fast-growing challengers such as Robinhood."" https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on. That's why the stock suddenly went from $150 to $80 in the space of an hour.

Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. WE'RE WINNING.

We saw this stop loss tactic yesterday, and it will happen again today, and the rest of the week too.

&#x200B;

With the first option they run the risk of asking someone who knows more than them and if they cannot shut us down then they end up looking stupid and we end up appearing as if the hive collectively is super educated and knowledgeable. Aka proof that 'stock can't be that hard' and all the hedge funds suffer as people withdraw.

the second ends up being equally as dangerous because now it just shows that stock is super easy and you don't need any level of competence.

The third is the most hilarious one. The mixed bag means it is entirely possible that they ask someone whose knowledge is entirely restricted to 'blackberries have erections' followed by gesturing in a way to suggest 'to the moon'. At this point the public/anyone who pays attention to financial news would immediately become convinced that not only is wsb completely incompetent and stupid but the entire market is nothing but smoke and mirrors (meaning they absolutely will not pick someone at random to question)

&#x200B;

So realistically their goal if they investigate and want to press forward is to avoid any kind of hearing or publicity because there is not a winning situation for them, but at the same time with people like Cramer and the countless news sources which seem to be on us lately...they don't really have another choice but to make a big show if they investigate and treat it seriously.

&#x200B;

They also don't have the option of investigating and giving any kind of lengthy statement. ""We investigated and found that it is not manipulating the market, and is just an investment forum"" is pretty much all they can say. It isn't like they can come out and say 'a bunch of self proclaimed retards and autists (many of which are single but still insist their wives have boyfriends) are better investors than hedge funds who are now being destroyed by the idiot convention'",0.081,0.82,0.098,0.8407

To everyone who doesn’t understand GME and what’s happening. Right now, GME is the highest ever shorted stock in history. Every day that we see green, the squeeze goes on.

Today may scare a lot of you. We all saw GME shoot to 150 and back down to 75. This kind of range has never been seen before in a billion+$ company.

2 questions - why and how.

The how is easier to understand so let’s start there. Because of the short seller contracts that are currently in process cover a LARGE amount of shares from what would be the float. This means that there is less available shares for trading making the price of the stock extremely volatile. Usually when this happens to a stock a short squeeze will ensue OR the stock will just be driven to bankruptcy... which is what the fuck heads at shitron and Melvin are trying to do. With GME - we are seeing a literal historic level of support for GME. This causes the price to go up and the short sellers to have to pay out the difference of how much it’s going up directly to the people who are taking them up on their put contracts. The most known user for taking up these contracts is u/deepfuckingvalue. With the profits from these calls, our compatriots are buying more shares and contracts. This has the possibility to literally go on forever, or until the short sellers are broke and give up. In the past when this happened, the short sellers stopped because they don’t want to get squeezed out of all their money. In the case of GME, the short sellers do not think that WSB has the ability to continue what we started and they are posting more and more short contracts. This means the squeeze is still on.

I’ve touched a bit on the why... but just to be clear we are at fucking war. When you watch this stock you can literally picture the LOTR meme of a battle between already rich jackasses who want GME staff out of jobs and the Reddit buyers keeping the price above yesterday’s... every day.

Every day we see green, we are making our call contracts print us money directly from Melvin and shitron and our leaders making these calls ARE buying shares I promise you.

To participate: buy shares. Hold them until GME hits 1000 or even after that.

A squeeze of this magnitude can literally bankrupt Andrew Left. But we need to stay strong.

The short ratio compared to share float is still above 200%. This is fucking nuts, and if we stop our unified force now, they will make their money back and move on with life.

NOW, yes literally NOW. Today. Tomorrow. NOW. Is the time where we can hit them where it hurts. We need more buys after hours today, pre market tomorrow and every single fucking dip that comes up tomorrow.

We have the power right now and we will not loose it. Participate and be rich, or watch us patiently.

Best of luck my fellow retard.

I finally handed in my notice to the boss this week. I spent 6 years here (5 of which were pretty miserable), my first professional job. Overlooked for promotions, no chances to advance, no respect. The pay was fantastic but the place is a textbook example of a toxic work environment. The problem was that I couldn’t (read: didn’t want to) leave. After years of therapy to address the paralysis coupled with perspective from corona, I finally got the courage to find a better job and gtfo.  

Throughout the years, I fantasized about all aspects of the day which I would finally flip the proverbial finger to my shite boss and quit. Well... here it is.. No fireworks, no parade. Just a calm awareness and appreciation that a rather complicated chapter of my life is finally closing. :’)

We were millennials just out of undergrad, so the 2008 downturn crushed us the hardest.  I had many friends who lost their jobs as well, and they had to choose between paying for crushing amounts of student loans, rent, food, or for healthcare (this was before Obamacare remember).  Needless to say, 2008 did a number on many of my friends' credit scores, and they are still trying to dig out of debt because 2008 fucked them royally since banks piled on fees and late penalties to people who couldn't pay off their student loans due to job loss.   And to top it off, Wall Street got billions in bailouts from taxpayers while no one went to jail for 2008. 

Fuck all of these assholes.  Pay back is a bitch.  You think we all forgot what these ahole elitists did during 2008 and the sweet bailouts they got while the rest of us suffered? Fuck no.

That $2.75 billion is going to probably come at us in a myriad of terrifying ways today and the primary way might be through wash trades where it LOOKS like your fellow WSB tards are selling.  This wash trading is illegal as fuck, but I don’t think that will matter at this point.

This equation is simple.  Supply and demand.

There are only two ways we die on the GME hill:

1.  Paper handed cowards sell them GME for less than $1,000 after they fall for the scare tactics.

2.  GME management sells them treasury stock in an off exchange transaction like what Elon did in December.

The moral of the story is:  HOLD and do not sell until GME is $1,000.  If there is no stock for sale under $1,000, they can’t buy shares for under $1,000.

1) Remove your stop losses, ur brokers arent ur friends, they are closer to the MMs and the shorts. They will see ur stop losses and try to trigger them.

2) Do NOT and I repeat do NOT be excited when we start going up. I know it's very hard to control urself when ur making more money in 1hr than you've seen in 6 months BUT. if u cant maintain mental strength, when u start seeing that amount go red, u will paper hand and sell. You will be helping the shorts as not only u give them shares but u help them FAKE a dump to make it look like people are running for the exits.

3) Start looking for patterns. After halts we start to drop then we go back up. I recommend tradingview.com to see charts properly. a TRADING HALT DOESN'T MEAN THE STOCK IS CRASHING just relax and breathe.

4) If you are new to the sub and have not experienced your account or the account of others being wiped out (hello RKT gang) buy in and close ur app till atleast 1pm if you know u cant control ur paper hands.

5) Expect dirty af tactics from shorts. We can only speculate what the $2.7 billion bailout will be used for. Perhaps after today we will have better insight so if something seems irregular dont be scared.

6) I love u all but PLEASE stop posting ur positions. These are $20 billion firms with educated employees(no not u guys who work behind Wendy's) and as speculative as this might be, we KNOW they are already in this sub. Do u not think they can get a scanner to analyze any mentions of gme, the position, amount of shares and ur sell or profit taking limit?? we literally do this exact same thing here where we have bots that count all mentions of a ticker. With big money they can do that on a DIFFERENT level.

so please if anything mention u got in and keep it at that.

Conclusion: Gonna be a hard day and honestly a hard week BUT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO GIVE UP $115 WE NEED $115 to even have a shot at a squeeze and we need it latest by Friday (yes I know I just mentioned a particular strike but only because the funds and MM already know how important $115  is so it's no secret)

Thats why they manipulate the market to scare weak hands into selling hoping to crash it. Which ultimately backfired because they now lost $4 Billion and diamond hands went up +20% for the day.

Victory is near because they lost $4 BILLION trying to scare diamond hands which ultimately backfired and just made shares more expensive causing us to reach new all time highs. Soon they will just cut their losses and take a loan to overpay for our shares.

Now do you get why its called Diamond hands? Because you know what you have. Don't panic you will soon be over compensated if you are patient. Thats why DeepFuckingValue doesn't sell because he knows exactly what his shares are worth.

So don't buy any of the newer out the money calls because you're giving them money on the premium. Which they will intentionally crash making sure you never hit that target.

Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders. It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC. That's the same citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital. Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on.

Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. WE'RE WINNING.

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on.

Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. WE'RE WINNING.

We saw this stop loss tactic yesterday, and it will happen again today, and the rest of the week too.

Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade and other brokerages to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.

> ""Chicago-based Citadel Securities accounts for 40 of every 100 shares traded by individual investors in the US, making it the number one retail market maker, according to Piper Sandler. The company is a big buyer of customer trades from the leading US retail brokerages such as Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, which have slashed commissions to zero to keep up with fast-growing challengers such as Robinhood."" https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on. That's why the stock suddenly went from $150 to $80 in the space of an hour.

Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. WE'RE WINNING.

We saw this stop loss tactic yesterday, and it will happen again today, and the rest of the week too.

Ok, retards, GME General here. Listen up, because this is important.

TL;DR at the bottom for those of you who can't read.

Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders. It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC. That's the same citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital. Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on.

Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. WE'RE WINNING.

We saw this stop loss tactic yesterday, and it will happen again today, and the rest of the week too.

4055,DD,"Just translated something from german wsb.

The most important thing is actually until Friday there will be another price battle in which the short sellers will try to keep as many calls as possible outside the price so that they cannot be executed and the broker does not have to buy them on the market to cover them .
It is particularly critical because monthly and weekly calls expire, as far as I know the highest monthly call was 60c 1/29 and 115c 1/29 (left out the new 200c).

The MM will try everything to push the course below 60 , our goal to get to 115 . Until then, expect massive short attacks , it will probably be even more blatant than yesterday. Since a price limit is harder to keep higher up, don't be surprised if there is a red tag up until then or the lower limit is 60-80.
For those of you who don't know what is meant, 100xLimit orders at $ 60 are $ 6000 <$ 11500 100x at $ 115 and easier to hold or buy from autistic people.

And almost most importantly , put your stop loss out , the shortsellers try to trigger as many as possible with their short sales in order to trigger a chain reaction of panic selling .

Remember yesterday we saw exactly that , price dumping at its finest, although almost no short position was powered.

Should we be able to hold the $ 115 by Friday , the banks (! Not the shortsellers) would have to buy an additional 8 million shares to cover the demand for the calls. To achieve this there is really only the possibility 🚀✋🏻💎🤚🏻,

Don't be a paper bitch!

All figures relate to estimates and information or assumptions and observations from DD from here and the Angelsachen forum. Due to the high trading volume, it is not possible to say how the share is currently distributed !!

This is not a financial advice, but an autistic one. Always invest wisely and make your own decisions.

Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders.
It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC.
That's the same Citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital.

Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on.

CANCEL YOUR STOP LOSS!

From a comment below: Ok, retards, GME General here. Listen up, because this is important.

TL;DR at the bottom for those of you who can't read.

Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders. It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC. That's the same citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital. Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on.

Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. WE'RE WINNING.

We saw this stop loss tactic yesterday, and it will happen again today, and the rest of the week too.

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on. That's why the stock suddenly went from $150 to $80 in the space of an hour.

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on. That's why the stock suddenly went from $150 to $80 in the space of an hour.

Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. WE'RE WINNING.

We saw this stop loss tactic yesterday, and it will happen again today, and the rest of the week too.

4223,CEO,"After being on the sidelines for the past months, curiously following the events that transpired with DFV, GME, RC and Melvin Capital, I have finally went through all the currently available information and realized this narrative became about something bigger than all of us here on this forum.

Now, we all know that the underlying characteristic joining all of us at their hips is a disgusting penchant for degenerate gambling and joyfully riding the highs and lows of the sea of loss and gain porn. However, after seeing everyone and their mother chipping in with their opinion on this matter (looking at you Cramer & media) I came to the conclusion we are in the process of literally making history - a potentially pivotal point in time where the game will be utterly changed for generations to come.

It's a story of progress and of change, of the new wave pushing against the behemoth walls of the old. A new wave of fresh retards armed with HOPE - a universal desire of chasing better lives for themselves and for each other, celebrating wins and commiserating on losses. The old wall of greedy hedge fund leaders, looking for a dime anywhere even if that means stepping over destitute workers and their families.

A story of elitism, where fresh perspectives clash against the circuits of the old: Cohen's plan vs. GME CEO & the board of directors. WSB as an individualist, collective-based hive mind of financial activists vs. the suits looking down their noses at the autists posting here.

The longs of hope vs. the shorts of hell.

As I said, this is bigger than all of us and like many others, I truly believe in the hope of turning around this company. The hope of saving these jobs by re-aligning a legacy business with modern values, aiming it at fresh opportunities.

4230,GME,"I have spent forever thinking about this and will offer my thesis  here.

1. Citadel and Point72 are both short GME and did not want Melvin to cover as that would drive up the price forcing them to cover. By loaning Melvin 2.75B they hope Melvin can ride this out. If we assume that these three are the majority of the shorts, perhaps 50M (maybe more) shares then you can simply compute what their fear is. If it squeezes to $500 and they can cover at $500 average that is $25 Billion in losses (pretty much all loss as the proceeds when they shorted were likely minimal). If it were to go up to $1,000, that would be $50 Billion and would almost definitively make those three entities bankrupt (if $25B does not). Loaning 2.75B to a hedge fund in trouble, knowing there is a good chance you lose that money only makes sense when you are trying to avoid a far greater doom.
2. Citadel and Point72 cannot exit their positions without risking a short squeeze. They are just too deep in. The only way out is to drive the price down and scare off investors. If the millions of small investors run away the big investors who are long will have less appetite to fight this and would not be as willing to try to trigger a short squeeze.
3. The above 2 points I think are pretty easy, the large short players here are simply too deep in and have no life jacket if the price goes up much more.
4. What happened this past Friday, as much as we are patting our hands on our backs, was likely only partly driven by us and more likely there was some large hedge fund pushing the gamma squeeze. They could have picked up OTM options for dirt cheap and then put the squeeze on thereby making tons on the options and then selling some of the shares on Monday easing up their position.
5. On Monday in addition to whichever hedge fund pushed this up selling off some shares, you had shares sold due to margin, you had shares sold due to exercises (i.e. essentially the same as sold due to margin), and you had shares perhaps naked shorted by MM's to bring the price down.
6. Rinse and repeat. Come Friday, big hedge fund again drives the price up to above $115 and buys OTM options and they profit. Come Monday similar pattern. But we are at a higher baseline.
7. The next Friday rinse and repeat, but this time the share price finally goes above Melvin's tolerance triggering a short squeeze which causes the price to skyrocket and forces Citadel, Point72, and anyone else to finally cover. Losses and gains will be in the tens of billions.
8. Of course things can go very differently and I usually get this stuff wrong, so just something for anyone smarter then me to chew on and tell me that I am wrong.

Not offering any strategy here, but I think there is a lot more going on behind the scenes and the above seems to make some sense to me. There is just no possible way that some major hedge fund is not playing this to make massive money off what is going on.

Edit 2: See they are opening up options for up to $200 for this week. When I wrote this the options were $115. If I am correct, this might mean we see a the big squeeze triggered this Friday (it might fully happen Monday...  or not happen at all, what do any of us know?).

MORE INFORMATION:

Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders. It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC. That's the same Citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital.

Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade and other brokerages to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.

I am in awe that articles coming out are borderline sympathetic to the ‘plight’ of anyone in the financial industry. 

Off the top of my head:

GS- 1.6B in bribes to Malaysian officials

DB- over 20B in money laundering for Russia

BSC et al- the 2008 crisis that brought the global financial system to its knees

WFC- fraudulent account openings/stock manipulation 

Epstein- enabled and embraced by all the pedo CEOs/hedge funds

Citi- female employees paid average of *27%* less than their male counterparts 

Gold and Silver price fixing- a shit load of banks

But retail are the barbarians.

If I understand correctly, not EVERYONE is going to be ABLE to cash out at the peak, right? At some point when people start selling, only the ones that sell first will be able to sell at peak value?  
I'm not trying to spread disinformation, I've actually been curious about this. I want to get in, but it seems too late. Secondly, because I don't watch the markets with much regularity, I feel like I'd get in, miss the ""wave"" and then end up losing.

4505,BIG,"I don't get what people here are missing.  

Melvin got paid $2.75 billion in basically a loan in order to help them close out their position.  

That means that we are looking at $2.75 BILLION entering this stock soon for the TINY amount of volume that is just being bounced back and forth. Yesterday's volume was like 170m, and I'd wager it was basically tantamount 3mil shares bouncing 60 times.  

Melvin **could not possibly have bought themselves out yesterday**. New shorts filled Melvin's old shoes and Melvin didn't completely abandon their shoes. Even if they purchased _every single stock that was offered_ they would not have closed out their position.  

They have money, literally billions of dollars, lined to buy this stock now. They hope it plummets so they can get it at a discount, but they are paying BIG ASS interest every single day they ride this wave and they are risking bankruptcy entirely if they don't act while they can. Better down 30% than bankrupt. Their reputation is getting on the line. This is all WAY too public for them now. They don't have the benefit of us all being anonymous retards on a forum.  

If the short squeeze causes all popular options to expire ITM again (a meager $115), we will see another gamma squeeze. This week could close out to fucking insanity. We saw a peak of $150 on just a _Monday_.  

Buy the fuck in. If you looked at this stock at $20, you would've thought you were too late. $30, $35, $40, $55, $60, $80, when WASN'T ""too late""?  

And I guarantee if the short squeezes and this goes back down to $80, you'll be paranoid it'll crash to $50 or $20, ""I was too late... so I missed out!""

This doesnt need to be for full value, it could be say after the loss exceeds 50% of the entire value of the company (thats why melvin capital has a capital infusion)     

If the shorts dont have enough $$, the lenders can force them to sell anything they have to meet the margin call and/or liquidate and take the loss.  
This sets a chain reaction because they need to buy back millions of share, the next short gets margin called too and the next and the next.

Here's a question, though: 

**What are the chances this squeeze never happens?** 

I've heard that some of these institutions, who are heavy on shorts, get special rates on their interest, so they won't lose out too much in the long-term (relative to the billions they're worth) and will just close little by little in the dips, until all the low value shorts are covered - then that leaves ""new-blood"" shorts, in a much higher price range, who are far less likely to ever suffer the same fate.

1.	260% or more of the float shorted. See yahoo finance or ortex for the proof. 
2.	short to float ration is like 13:3

\- KODAK went from 2.5 dollars to 60 dollars in 2 days (jump of 25x, or 2500%, though it can be argued that the day 1 jump from 2.5 to 7.5 was news based, causing approx 9x jump)- OSTK went from 2.5 dollars to 125 dollars in a few months

\- VW from 175 to 1000 (6x? idk i can't math). Also remember that VW was already one of the worlds biggest companies in 2008, AND AT 1000 IT WAS THE LARGEST MARKET CAP EVER TO EXIST!!! Wtf will a squeeze do to a piddling sub-$10bil company like GME??

There are a few others like Blue apron etc to look at.

&#x200B;

Each of these scenarios was very different with totally different short to float ratios.

&#x200B;

Now consider the following:

\- Retail is very confident in a squeeze happening. It looks like our warriors are diamond handing this to the end

\- Shorts are very clearly doubling down on their bets

\- Retard boomers are persuading noobs to short, unfortunately (for them) adding waaaay more fuel to the fire at the higher levels. If you think of a short position like a mini speed boost in mario kart, do you want LOOOADS of speed boosts one in front of the other, or spread out evenly to help maintain top speed for longer.

TLDR: $1000 IS NOT A FUCKING MEME!!

4592,GME,"From what I understand, the VW squeeze settled at 1000 because Porsche agreed to sell a large amount of shares to the shorts at this price point. If this is true (and I'm just a fellow retard, so what do I know), it would mean that this time, given no big players are involved, there is nobody to define a price. 

With VW, there was no way that shorts could cover. They needed Porsche and Porsche could, as one entity, decide on a price. They chose 1000, shorts covered, price got back to the original level.

I have no idea how shorts could cover more than 100% with GME if there is no big player willing to sell them shares which are not free float. So they'll  either need to keep some or have somebody else take over their short position. I would assume they'll also cover slowly but steadily, to not inflate prices to much.

Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders. It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC. That's the same Citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital.

Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade and other brokerages to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.

""Chicago-based Citadel Securities accounts for 40 of every 100 shares traded by individual investors in the US, making it the number one retail market maker, according to Piper Sandler.

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on. That's why the stock suddenly went from $150 to $80 in the space of an hour.

Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. WE'RE WINNING.

Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. WE'RE WINNING.

We saw this stop loss tactic yesterday, and it will happen again today, and the rest of the week too.

TL;DR: GET RID OF YOUR FUCKING STOP LOSSES, OR WE WILL NEVER REACH VALHALLA.

Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders. It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC. That's the same Citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital.

Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade and other brokerages to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.

""Chicago-based Citadel Securities accounts for 40 of every 100 shares traded by individual investors in the US, making it the number one retail market maker, according to Piper Sandler. The company is a big buyer of customer trades from the leading US retail brokerages such as Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, which have slashed commissions to zero to keep up with fast-growing challengers such as Robinhood."" https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b

5337,GME,"Look GME might go 1000 and if it does congrats to anyone holding. Truth is GME is a casino. And you cash out before you bust. GME might be a solid company with a solid future but it isn't a company worth 1000$ per share. It is a big standard retail with razor thin margins. It can survive but if you invest you follow the profits, you go for the deals. GME at 80$ is not a deal. Let's say it goes to a 1000 everyone will sell and there aren't any buyers till 20$ so if you bought at 80$ your chances of loosing 75% of your money is high. At some point you have to consolidate your investment either in dividends or sale of the stock. GME can't warrant a 1000$ stock price at it's dividend level. What 70 million stocks at what 200-300 million revenue? That's 2-3$ dividend if they would turn out there whole revenue. That's like 10$ a year on dividends or 100 years to return the stock. So you have to sell if you want your value, who will buy at 1000$? The idiots who think it will go to 2000$?

5406,BB,"Thanks for that explanation. I was just about the write a question asking why someone would want to buy options when they had cash in hand vs stocks.  


If  I'm understanding this correctly, does that mean the OP wrote those contracts to buy BB stocks with those strike prices at the expiry date. When the stock performs well then the value of the option increases because someone can effectively buy the contract to buy the stock at a lower price.

What I'm trying to understand is if the person has cash on hand, why do people tend to start with option positions before transitioning to shares. If they want to long  and hold the position wouldn't you want to buy as much stock at the lower price first, than hold contracts and buy at a higher price later?

Stop drinking the soy milk dude I did a couple years ago and you will see changes happen.

I'm old enough to know that basically anytime and I mean any f****** time the Democrats work with the Republicans you can expect some really shity deal is coming down the pipeline for the average  everyday American person and they did the same shit after 9/11 which it seems like most of the f****** retards on these boards weren't even born yet.

Guys like you will be sitting there oh look!!!! the Republican and Democrats are working hand-in-hand this must be really good really good things are going to happen now I can trust all forms of government to work together.

Furthermore if they had the concrete case if they had all that stuff why in the hell did they just tell us over the past 4 years????   Why does it keep on saying all we have it wait and see wait till you see this we have it oh you're going to be blown away whenever we show it and all the while bailing out people that were burning cities do the f****** ground it was all done for politics because of useful idiots like yourself so you can f****** fall for it.

Oh wow look Covid relief Iran and Saudi Arabia this is really going to work really good for us here in America this is a wonderful thing!!!

Let's blindly let all of them into the country including the criminals and the same with anybody that being detained here even the pedophiles anybody that's raped children violently let's let them all in here because this will all work out good and that's where I get my smile the greatest Moment when the Liberals get with a f****** deserve from people who they allowed into the country to harm them in the first place that is the sweetest drink I could ever enjoy and it's sweeter than your soy milk could ever taste

Just like whenever a terrorist runs around and starts swinging there machete around and slicing people you have to wonder how many of those people are f****** retards like yourself.

As l see the swings of the market go up and down - a*nd pouncing on each opportunity to take more shares off the market* \- I see them sweating. Getting scared. Spending BILLIONS to prevent the inevitable.

&#x200B;

Before you put your order in, ask yourself one question - do you have what it takes? There might be swings that make you sick to your stomach. Can you handle that without selling? If you can't, sit this one out. You are not doing yourself or us any favours. **We have the control.** **Just DON'T FUCKING SELL. \***

Your strat of selling puts and buying shares is silly to me because the premiums for selling calls are so high in comparison that you could have bought 100 shares at 18 today and then sold the 25 call for around $170 whereas if you sold a put more than 2 strikes out you would receive less than $100....

The money you make from selling puts pales in comparison to selling covered calls and having the stock called away, and if it doesn't get called away the premiums on the calls are hyper inflated and net you much more $ compared to puts also

Ex sell 1 put for 100, stock doubles. You make 100....

6009,GME,"Everyone calm the FUCK down - if you’re sick to your stomach over GameStonk, read this.

Alright animals, I am here to offer some comfort in these trying times. The TLDR of this is - HOLD, this is the bumpy, exciting, volatile beginning of our tendie launch. 

The avalanche of actual idiots selling because of circuit breakers and bad articles and whatnot is 10/10 retarded. There’s no reason you can’t hold. I get that some of you have never had gains so high (shit, I haven’t - I could’ve had a heart attack because of premarket gains) but the fact of the matter is, if you HOLD now, you will BENEFIT later. 

This is a shout out to the real gods in WSB holding the goddamn line and seeing through the scare tactics. We all need to have DFV hands up in here. Don’t be the guy that got scared of a little loss. Don’t sell your positions. You’ll regret it one day. 

There’s still shorts to squeeze, guys. It isn’t over. Hold on tight, and actually believe. Go take a walk. Pet a dog. Cook some food. For fucks sake, go do something other than stress about shit you can’t change - highs and lows are going to happen whether you’re staring at your phone or not. 

Take a break, kings and queens. Rest up. The war isn’t over. Don’t fuckin sell, and if you do, don’t bitch when GME hits the hundreds.

Mentioned:	BB FB
RBC Capital Markets analyst Paul Treiber downgraded shares of BlackBerry Ltd. (BB.T) to underperform from sector perform Tuesday, citing a big recent rally for the shares amid little change in the prospects for the company's unified endpoint management (UEM) or Cylance security businesses. ""BlackBerry is now trading at multi-year highs and above peers,"" Treiber wrote, following a 207% rally since the end of November versus a 6% rise for the S&P 500 over that span. He said that BlackBerry reported its fiscal third-quarter results in December, showing a drop in dollar-based net revenue retention. Treiber also wrote that the ""probability of an unannounced IP licensing gain appears low."" BlackBerry sold 90 patents to Huawei and struck a patent-licensing settlement with Facebook Inc. (FB), which Treiber called ""positive"" events, though he argued that ""the magnitude of the potential one-time gain is likely to be smaller than the $7B increase in the company's market cap."" A Dec. 15 court filing suggests that the Facebook arrangement was reached prior to the third quarter and might already be reflected in the company's outlook, he said. Treiber kept his $7.50 price target intact on BlackBerry shares, which closed Monday at $18.03 after a 28% rally. The stock is up another 11% in premarket trading Tuesday.",0.029,0.858,0.113,0.9477

6665,GME,"Rich boomer cunts are betting against an undervalued company. (GameStop). WSB betting for GameStop. WSB is currently in a war with hedge fund owners (billionaires), the media and possibly even the SEC (although this has been proven to not be the case many times). 

Now here’s the important part. Shares work on a supply-demand model (over simplified ik, but it works). The more people who want a share, the higher the price. The more people selling the share, the lower the price. Hedge funds want to sell, to lower the price as far as possible, in order to get maximum capital gains. WSB wants to buy, get the price as high as possible in order to cripple boomer billionaire hedge fund owners, and to make a shit ton of money. Hence, the ‘meme’ nature of the stock, and that’s why everyone’s buying into it.

However, hedge fund owners and the media are biting back. The media is running a campaign to de-legitimise WSB and push a narrative of market manipulation. This is ironic, because they bring on hedge fund owners to shit on WSB (and the GameStop stock) in order to drive prices downwards. Secondly, two of the biggest hedge funds out there (Citadel and Point72) had to bail another hedge fund out (Melvin capital). Citadel is also trying to get GME’s price down, as they will serve to profit from it.

NOK also got an upgrade of one of the most influencial finance institutes of Scandinavia (SEB) with an upgraded price target and buy recommendation:

 

The Finnish maker of [telecom-grade networking equipment](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/20/will-nokia-finally-be-a-5g-stock-to-buy-in-2021/) received a rosy report from SEB, one of the largest financial institutions in Scandinavia. SEB raised its target price on Nokia from $4.25 to $4.60 per share and reiterated its buy rating on the stock. The report turned into a self-fulfilling prophecy, as Nokia's stock now trades above the target price that sounded so bullish before the opening bell. The financial group argued that Nokia's stock is undervalued in comparison to Swedish rival **LM Ericsson**, whose stock trades at far higher price-to-sales and price-to-free-cash-flow ratios.

Now what

SEB expects low drama in Nokia's fourth-quarter earnings report, which is due Feb. 4. The firm also expects Nokia to reinstate its dividend policy, which has been paused since the summer of 2019. It's no surprise to see Nokia's shares surging in response to this bullish analysis. This company is a global leader in the market for [5G wireless carrier](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) equipment, which will remain an explosive opportunity for the next few years.
