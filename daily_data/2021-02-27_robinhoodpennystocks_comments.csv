0,DD," Yeah, I’m fairly new to the investing world, but I see a lot of this from the newer folks like me. Coming in a bunch of threads and parroting the WSB clan. Like, I got no problem with that, but whenever someone tries to be logical and ask questions on WSB they point them in the direction of r/investing or r/stocks so this is the same thing. You wanna give low effort posts, no DD, and simply parrot jargon without adding value to the conversation feel free to go elsewhere. That being said, I try my best also not to be a Karen or boomer since I am neither. Just someone who wants facts and information to make good stock choices without the diamond hand/ape/autistic static in the thread. When I want that I go to all 72 WSB subs.",ridcosky,54,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ltnfk3/rhps_or_wsb_jr/gozp774/,0.107,0.744,0.149,0.829
1,DD," I agree with you. To me, wsb is that clique in high school that everyone wants to be in until you get in and find out its a lot of hot air. I have utmost respect for what wsb has been able to accomplish but I think it's a herd mentality, everyone trying to outdo the next guy. The feeling in RHPS is a community, to me. We want to see people succeed and want to post good DD when we have it. We all struggle with holding too long, buying too high and getting too attached. We don't need to see some flamboyant post by a parrot who has low self esteem.",Hardheadedhungarian,17,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ltnfk3/rhps_or_wsb_jr/gp03zc5/,0.047,0.799,0.154,0.872

But all they know is WSB slogans and catchphrases ""I like the stonk"", ""My wife's boyfriend"", ""Tendies"" and nothing else.

Some swore last month after losing a bunch that they were ready to take it serious, and trade/invest the right way moving forward. Then they were hit with the reality that learning DD, terminology, how to read charts, picking entry/exit points is HARD WORK.

8,DD," I completely agree. I’m in my mid 20s and have some WSB loyal friends, but I’m not here for that. I think the only WSB things that are worth the time is when they do actually make a post of substance (like they had some DD on RKT the other day that was decent, tho the stock did not “go to Mars” or whatever they tried to claim) and that can be shared to this sub. But I think the vast majority of WSB is not there to genuinely learn and I feel for them when their luck YOLOing money at meme stocks runs out. I’m all for getting the community together to push stocks that are worth it. Not a penny but yesterday and OCGN is an example with the number of posts about it on Stocktwits (also not a great source but same idea). A lot of people pumped that stock but with very good reason. 

The WSB crowd also is something of a different mindset too from what I’ve observed. People on this sub have tended to hope for the end of meme stocks and look for things to go back to normal so our genuine/normal investments can get on track. WSB loyalists think meme stocks are the best thing to ever happen to Wall Street and the economy... which to me feels dangerous. No, I’m not for huge HFs controlling everything but the way they’ve gone about it seems to be discrediting what they claimed their mission to be initially.

46,AGTC," I'm one, kind of.

Bought my first shares back around $4.2, went up over the $8.5+ spike then sold in increments stopping in the $6.60s. Not because I don't like the stock, I do, but I thought it was overvalued. If I had any money left I'd be buying some now though.

So the two ""negatives"" (I use the word losely here) I see with AGTC are 1) The diseases they treat are quite rare and relatively non-debilitating which generally means minimal profitability. And 2) the huge PTs are based on [rumors of a Sanofi buyout.](https://m.thefly.com/#/new-landing/3119774)

But why would Sanofi want unprofitable meds? They probably don't, I think they want AGTC's gene therapy technology. To me that's the only thing that can validate a $35 PT, and if that's how it goes it would be a home run.

But I'm wary, pharma buyouts are fickle things every time. Then add the fact that Sanofi just completed a buyout ~~of a large competitor and my risk radar is pinging.~~

47,PT," I'm one, kind of.

Bought my first shares back around $4.2, went up over the $8.5+ spike then sold in increments stopping in the $6.60s. Not because I don't like the stock, I do, but I thought it was overvalued. If I had any money left I'd be buying some now though.

So the two ""negatives"" (I use the word losely here) I see with AGTC are 1) The diseases they treat are quite rare and relatively non-debilitating which generally means minimal profitability. And 2) the huge PTs are based on [rumors of a Sanofi buyout.](https://m.thefly.com/#/new-landing/3119774)

But why would Sanofi want unprofitable meds? They probably don't, I think they want AGTC's gene therapy technology. To me that's the only thing that can validate a $35 PT, and if that's how it goes it would be a home run.

But I'm wary, pharma buyouts are fickle things every time. Then add the fact that Sanofi just completed a buyout ~~of a large competitor and my risk radar is pinging.~~

52,MVIS," I was using MVIS to learn more about options trading. I knew there was risk involved, but the risk was still on the upside of things (selling covered calls). I ended up having to sell my MVIS shares at $3.50 because the literal day after I sold my contracts (price was sub $3 when I sold them) the price sky rocketed, and it never stopped climbing. 

Call options were exercised and I had to watch a 15x profit turn into about 2x.

I also have plenty of other cases like yours where I sold things for sub $1 and now they are $20-50+. There will be others, I’m sure, and I’m sure I’ll sell plenty of them for chump change, too.

If nothing else, I’ve learned that patience is worth it if you aren’t being greedy for the swing plays, and that I should always remind myself and be happy with “profit is profit”.",Ghiado,5,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ltcxv2/im_sick_to_my_stomach/goxbmce/,0.043,0.791,0.166,0.9663

120,ABUS," Out of 11, the only three left in the green at the moment are:    
VTVT - this stock annoys me as it is still giving me hope in the sea of red. Look up the insiders who have bought in over the last 90 days.    
REML - it dipped...and despite how this week has been going, I bought more. It actually came out of the dip and stayed up until close. It is also annoying as it is also giving me hope.   
OBSV - it was working on its third dip of the day when the bell cut its dive. Holding it based on projections,  bullish analysts reports and maybe a dash of stubbornness.    

Others I am still holding:    
AGTC: mid to long.    
CTXR: mid to long.    
GHSI: it’s down so much that a reverse split is apt to be the only thing that saves it from delisting. I am down 51% on it after this hellish week and I am going to keep holding it as I am not locking in a 51% loss. I’d rather go for full loss porn and let it hit -99% at this point.    
ASRT - the interest in this one has been spattered all over the group for days so no need to repeat it.    
LGHL - it always jumps up when you think it’s dead. It will at least go up enough for me to get 100% of my money back and I am not locking in any losses just yet.   
EBON - because with the way stocks are acting, crypto almost seems like a safe move and people always gets bored and dabble in crypto on the weekends. Crypto goes up, EBON goes up.    
ABUS - look at the 3 month chart for it - it is currently at 3.80 (I ended up slightly ahead with it this week) but it has a history of spiking up to $5-$6 at fairly regular intervals and it has even hit $9 at one point. Insiders have sold shares in the last 3 months and I usually avoid “insiders sold” stocks but analysts have given it $5-$10 price targets for EOY. They are in phase II testing for a Hep B cure. I like this stock.

**NAK ($0.7951)** which rose off news that the US army corps of engineers accepted their REQUEST for appeal for their lone, company hinging project.

**CTRM ($1.02)** dude keeps buying boats.  I've hopped in and out of this stock a few times for gains and I do think $1 could be a profitable entry point. (This closed at $1 and rose to $1.02 AH so I'm including it).

**GHSI ($0.50)** in my opinion has some cool products for the eyes, but they are struggling for compliance. Just announced a 6-to-1 reverse stock split. I do think they're a good hold for the long term but right now they're free falling.

**ACST ($0.769)** has no products and is hoping to get acquired. Their flagship drug failed FDA trials. I have zero idea why this stock is seeing this amount of volume.

**ITP ($0.76)** just announced a $20 million offering of common stock and warrants. They are a North China paper company. I don't know much about this company.

**GTE ($0.8401)** just had their earnings report last week which was...ok I guess. Brent prices are still high. I have ridden this stock for gains a few times.

**ASRT ($0.88)** has plenty of DD to be found on this sub. I think without any news their upcoming earnings will be kind of make or break.

If it gets exercised, I am okay with taking a 50% profit but if it's close to that price mid April, I will probably just look to roll the call up and out.

Edit:  If it doesn't get exercised, I'll continue selling a monthly covered call to keep reducing cost basis.

168,SOS," People, just something to consider before you put blind faith in either camp. I suggest neither buying the stock nor shorting it. Too many uncertainties for me. There are better games elsewhere.

To be honest Hindenberg and that Belmont Capital sound pretty shady themselves. However, if you go through their claims they are not blatant lies. I saw that at the least SOS has been a bit sloppy in their professional practices and made some questionable decisions (like their latest double offering).",KoreanDudeInAus,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ltufsb/everything_that_needs_to_be_known_about_sos/gp2o6uz/,0.079,0.765,0.157,0.8037

I don’t have a position anymore, but will probably buy calls or puts depending on the response, but this whole thing reeks. Hindenburg had to have opened their short position earlier in the week and then dropped the report at 1 PM when it looked like SOS was on track to close above $7.

172,DD," Workhorse also never responded. Idex also never responded. Responding to illegitimate claims only gives more credibility to the garbage. 

I’m tired of talking about Hindenburg tbh. They said the EXACT SAME THING about riot & Mara. Mara used to mine uranium btw. They also said NIO was fake. People have actually made quite a bit of money from doing the exact opposite of what Hindenburg claims. They did call Nikola so give them some credit but they are by no means factual or even correct more than half the time. 

I tend to believe credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley more than some BS scare tactics. Morgan Stanley did the IPO. The level of DD Morgan Stanley did is fine with me. Basically, if Hindenburg is correct, they’ve uncovered an immense fraud that multiple International banks & financiers missed? Somehow I doubt it. 

However, they are short on SOS, so they probably started their position earlier in the week. The release the info right when it’s peaking Friday? I think it’s hilarious people don’t see the obvious; they covered their short position and imo took a long position BECAUSE when SOS is running, it’ll be larger than RIOT mining capabilities. They will also be one of the only companies mining ethereum; so their market share will be enormous. 

I think we see it pop next week tbh. Looks similar to Mara, riot, NCTY run up. These stocks are super volatile, but ya know what makes it worse for investors, when places like Hindenburg make false claims & people panic. Their hit jobs on Mara and Riot were baseless much like this, I imagine.

If you don't need the money, keep it for a while. I know more about dry cargo than tankers, but this could be a bumper year for shipping overall: we're entering a commodity super-cycle with correlated increasing demand for oil & gas. The outlook for tanker shipping looks [promising until 2025](https://www.seatrade-maritime.com/tankers/tanker-shipping-outlook-looks-promising-till-2025).

As for Pyxis itself, they just completed a private placement, which pushed down their share price temporarily.

195,GME," I have an outlier view: buying GME is ethically wrong because it is exploiting a bad cop. As I see it, GME was driven by naked shorts. Naked shorts are against the rules and have been since 2008. However, the SEC under the Trump administration never enforced that rule contrary to their congressional charter.  

In a functioning, healthy ecosystem the entire GME situation would never have happened because the SEC would have put a stop to it before it could take flight. To me, people like RoaringKitty and DFV are like the meme ""lootie"" character. They are running off with the booze while the system is broken down due to a crisis.

197,GME," They say the market is tanking on interest rate hike fears.  The economy recovering means interest rates might start creeping up.  These big traders don't like their free loans stopping.  Also if cash makes you more in guaranteed money from higher interest many pull out of risky stocks and park into cash (bonds, CDs etc).  It is basically more options available to make money other than stocks that weren't there before.

THCX is a holding company in the weed biz.  I bought two shares because they pay divs and were cheap. 

BIGC is going to be the shopify killer.  (I'm a customer) 

I've made a few 100 off $NAK and lost most of my profits from $NAK buy once again trading $NAK.  The denial sucked.  I thought for sure that the government would allow it to pass.  I'm fine with my $100 profit.  And I'm not selling because it was my first penny stock.  

Rolls-Royce is a solid company.  And this OTC ADR is a no brainer.  It bounces up and down with every news article about covid and the UK Gov.  Easy to make cash on. 

VALPQ. When I see a penny stock being hyped I buy a small amount to remind me to research it.  I lost $10?  Not really concerned about it. (full time job.  Buying a small amount makes me obligated to research it).  Valpq is a shit trade.  Only reason I didn't sell was because it lost value right when I bought it.  I don't really need that $2 

ZOM,  get in now and sell half your stock come end of March.  They have a good product. 

I'm up 70% of my initial investment since I started trading a year ago.  Come end of year I'm aiming for 150%.

208,CEO," From taste Q 

REDWOOD CITY, CA / ACCESSWIRE / February 11, 2021 /Biotricity, Inc. (OTCQB:BTCY) (""Biotricity"" or the ""Company""), a medical diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company, is pleased to provide unaudited, preliminary financial results for its fiscal 2021 third quarter, which ended December 31, 2020. Full financial results will be posted on EDGAR on February 16, 2021. Biotricity's Q3 results continued a trend of both sequential and year over year revenue growth, with revenue setting a new quarterly record in the fiscal third quarter.

For fiscal Q3 2021, management is reporting the following highlights:

Revenue of $1 million (USD) - a milestone for Company in its quarterly results

Year-over-year quarterly revenue increased 162%

Sequential quarter-over-quarter revenue increase 34.5%

""We achieved significant growth during a period of restricted travel due to Covid, so we are even more optimistic about our growth potential as the business environment unlocks,"" stated Waqaas Al-Siddiq, CEO of Biotricity. ""Our sequential quarterly growth really illustrates the importance of our technology and model, where we are enabling a cardiologist while improving patient care. Monthly sequential growth is a sure sign that our platform is on target, and we are on track to continue our strong sequential and year over year growth.""

""During the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company experienced a gross margin of 49.2% compared to 43.6% in the preceding quarter,"" said Biotricity's CFO, John Ayanoglou. ""This improvement is consistent with our prior forecast that the cost of devices sold and other technology associated fees will become a lower percentage of revenues as sales volumes expand. We had significant product development activity during the quarter, including an FDA filing, so our net loss of $0.11 per share was higher than the net loss of $0.085 cents per share in Q2.""

In the current quarter (fiscal Q4 2021) and for the remainder of calendar 2021, the Company is guiding to continued triple-digit revenue growth on a year over year basis. With added resources from a convertible debt financing completed in January 2021, Biotricity is currently interviewing additional sales personnel as part of a planned geographic expansion into additional states. The Company filed a 510(K) seeking FDA approval for its new Biotres Holter product on December 31, 2020 and expects the review process to run approximately four months.

Dr. Waqaas Al-Siddiq added, ""We are coming out of the gate at a full sprint in 2021, with salesforce expansion and work underway on new products that will enable us to target a much larger segment of the cardiologist patient population. We spent years developing best-in-class technology coupled with a compelling technology as a service model. We are pleased with our results and look forward to further progress in upcoming quarters.""",Bcl3018,-3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ltd0q3/btcy_biotricity/goxdmy5/,0.032,0.835,0.133,0.9914
