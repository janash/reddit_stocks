3,EARN," Going to be some downvotes on this one, but... I'm holding GME while flat broke, so... fuck it.

So, I'd like to make a few points here...

1. In many areas, 3% each side (6% total) is not the norm. Many areas it's more like 2% or 2.5% each side.
2. If you think all Real estate agents do is 'take some pictures and put that shit up on the internet' you are vastly mistaken. Here's just a few other things that Agents are responsible for:
   1. Providing E&O insurance if anything goes wrong with your transaction.
   2. Handling all documentation & communication between parties, along with negotiations on your behalf.
   3. Showing the home to potential buyers and/or promoting the home in multiple ways, including open houses (depending on the area, of course).
   4. Providing a professional layer of protection aside from what I've already noted, so that they are there to actually facilitate the sale/purchase being done legally and responsibly, with as much information needed on both sides as possible.
3. Zillow is Garbage. Seriously. There are literally dozens of other companies doing the discount Listings services in every state, and most of them are locally/regionally owned, so they are better places to put your money anyway.

Now, all that said, are all agents great, upstanding people? No, haha... I'd say over half are garbage, possibly as much as three quarters - but this is where most people fuck up - they don't treat realtors as a product, and they should. You should meet with a few realtors before choosing one, and you should be candid with your expectations for them. If they can't meet those expectations, then either A) adjust if they have a reasonable reason why not, or B) find someone who can.

What most people, including clearly the OP, truly don't understand though is that Real Estate is this shiny, twinkling thing that people are told will make them rich - Be an agent, sell homes, make tons of money!

Only about 10% of all Real Estate agents in the U.S. make over $100k/year. About another 10% make over $60k/year... the other 80% typically don't last more than 2 years before they go get a 'real' job. Real estate is cut throat in a lot of markets, and there are firmly entrenched 'old guard' types in most major markets that can make it really difficult for upcoming, GOOD people to get started - just another reason it's good when people shop around. Often a new agent, fresh from their Ethics and Law classes (yes, they actually have to take those), is waaaaay more likely to go above and beyond, and EARN that 2, 2.5, 3% than some King Cobra that's been doing it for 30 years.

Look, I get it. It's sales. Salespeople generally suck... but unlike almost every other form of sales, Real Estate agents actually do serve an additional purpose other than just 'listing the home' or 'showing you a home'. Talk to any of the hundreds of people EVERY YEAR who end up in court because of title issues, deed issues, illegal contracts, falsified documentation, and so on because they figured they could just do it on their own.

I do agree that in a lot of cases, the % model isn't the way to go, but that's where negotiation comes in... think of it like this:

* If you're selling a home for $300,000, and your agent wants 2.5%, and assume 2.5% for the other side. That's $15,000 total, $7,500 per agent... but the brokerage is going to take between 10 and 30% of that depending on their contract, average 20%, so immediately that's now $6,000. That agent is going to, on average (you can easily look this up), spend roughly 20 hours working on each client. Assuming they are in the under 100k tax bracket, that means they are really taking home about $5,000, or about $250 per hour. Sounds like a ton of money right? Except they may only have one house closing every two months, or every 3 months, especially given the sheer number of agents out there right now... so all the sudden they are looking at that hourly rate not really mattering, since annually they are making the equivalent of working at starbucks full time.
* If you're selling a home for $1m, and your agent wants 2.5%, tell them no. It's really not that difficult. You tell them that $50,000 for a combined total of 20-40 hours work between two people is not reasonable, and negotiate either a smaller percentage, or better yet, a flat rate. Tell an agent they will get a flat $10,000 guaranteed, and they are a lot more likely to accept than if you call it 1% (because that sounds shitty - most of these people are not that bright). Especially if this is a newer agent, that's the kind of money that can save their career.
* These agents, depending on their brokerage, also have to pay for all their own marketing items, desk fees, real estate licensing costs, educational costs, etc. etc... this stuff adds up, and in a lot of cases can be Thousands of dollars per year on their own.

Anyway, sorry to ramble on, but I see this hate for Agents a lot, and much of it is warranted (stereotypes exist for a reason), but I do think it's important to remember that most Agents are just people trying to scrape by. /shrug",shichiaikan,158,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/olqhjh/zillow_is_aiming_to_kill_real_estate_agents/h5gdkkx/,0.058,0.869,0.072,0.9281

6,ALL," LOL, this is literally the worst real estate market there has ever been to sell to an iBuyer platform. There is more value in being on the MLS and getting multiple offers/competitive bids than there ever has been. Real Estate is worth more now that it has ever been...ever. 

Giving concessions for ANYTHING in this market is basically getting bent over a barrel. And relying on Zestimate to value a house is probably the #1 rookie mistake you can make, maybe #2 after giving concessions in the hottest market since North America was discovered. 

100% sure you made less money than you would have if you had listed on MLS with an knowledgeable agent that was competent enough to negotiate a multiple offer deal. Yes, even with the 6%...when you consider that your purchase price would have been much higher, you would not have given up 10K in concessions, and you paid 1% anyway. 

Just because you like a stock doesn't mean ALL of their offerings bring value in all situations. Zillow makes money selling ads. Because they were the first large and successful aggregator of MLS listings they have massive traffic and click-through. Buying and selling property is a very small portion of their income, and frankly it is not what they are good at. They are good at DATA, collecting it and presenting it. They are a tech company, not a real estate company. They just bought one of the largest appointment booking companies in the real estate space (ShowingTime)...Because the appointment process provides an insane amount of data about who and what is happening with properties. 

Zillow may do well, but it won't be because they are buying and selling houses to and from people that are bitter towards real estate agents, or otherwise. It will be because they are a tech company in the real estate industry that has more data about real estate than anyone else. They will never replace the local real estate agent or steal enough of their business to make any significant difference in their bottom line, or the price of their stock.",HTX2727,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/olqhjh/zillow_is_aiming_to_kill_real_estate_agents/h5h7sfl/,0.039,0.88,0.081,0.7584
7,TV," I'm not really surprised at a lot of the hateful comments against real estate agents in this thread. I agree with a lot of these comments about there being a lot of bad, worthless, scummy, agents out there. I also agree that the bar needs to be raised on becoming a real estate agent. I am a real estate agent and the broker of my independent real estate office.

I went to college, hold 2 degrees and decided to transition from data analytics to real estate 10 years ago. What I find to be a very interesting phenomenon in real estate, is that your skill level or education do not guarantee success at all. I've seen some extremely successful real estate agents that do not know how to properly fill out a contract or do a decent job at figuring out value. They simply do well because of their connections and ability to convince people to use them. That part of the business definitely stings, since it kind of becomes a popularity contest and an endless amount of cheesy headshots or bench ads.

However, OP, if you think that a real estate agent's job is simply taking a few pictures and putting the property on the MLS, it shows that you don't fully understand what goes on behind the scenes. There are so many ways that a buyer or a seller can be greatly impacted by how the contract to purchase is filled out. There are also many ways that you can endanger your escrow deposit, buy a house with faulty electric or piping, price yourself incorrectly during the crucial first weeks, incorrectly vet a buyer's and lose precious time, incorrectly select who pays special assessments if they were to occur after the contract date, neglect to check the homeowner association to see if they have reserves, do not specify what to do if there are permits or violations on the property, what steps to take if the seller does not want to perform, request the condominiums bylaws and take the 3 Days to analyze everything, and an endless amount of other scenarios and situations that happen on almost every transaction.

In my obviously biased opinion, a good agent is absolutely worth their commission. Are there some agents that get away with doing the bare minimum? Of course. Just like in any industry, there are bad apples. 

OP, you didn't specify how much you sold your investment property for. $10,000 and a 1% commission could be a steal or a terrible deal depending on the price you sold it for. Ask any real estate appraiser what they think about the Zillow Zestimate. It's a joke and should not be looked at seriously. It's a simple algorithm that gathers past sales, then incorrectly adds in pending sales which have not closed and therefore have incorrect data, makes no adjustments for things such as updates, Lot location, waterfront or impact windows. I just sold a home for $410,000 which the Zillow sentiment said it was only worth $375,000.

I wrote this long ass post because I agree and disagree with some of the statements you made. It almost seems as if you were screwed over by a real estate agent in the past or seem to despise them for another reason. I hope you didn't go through something like that, which I would totally understand your disdain towards real estate agents. Just know that there are some good ones out there, who genuinely want to help their clients, are hard working people and have nothing to do with that ridiculous Million Dollar Listing garbage they put on TV.

I'm happy for the sale of your investment property, you sold at a great time when there is almost no inventory and an absolute frenzy of buyers. Zillow will not replace real estate agents as they depend on a syndication feed from the individual MLS in order to have any content on their site. If all of the realtor associations decide to turn off their syndication feeds, Zillow would lose 99.9% of the properties on their site. Zillow makes their money on selling leads to real estate agents, and agents benefit from having their properties listed on the highest traffic real estate website in the country. It's a mutually beneficial partnership and I personally welcome the transparency and additional visibility Zillow brings to the table.",sebastian80,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/olqhjh/zillow_is_aiming_to_kill_real_estate_agents/h5ha61g/,0.092,0.812,0.096,0.7386

Realtors have to be marketing experts. They have to be legal experts. They have to negotiate 30-40 fine points of a contract all of which have drastic effects on your home sale. Your option period, your earnest money, repairs, safety-nets, clauses, SO much. 

They have to follow up constantly with 15 or more people all working behind the scenes for the deal to go properly.

A good realtor will get you more than 6% above what Zillow will give you. In fact, the Zestimate is usually more than 6% less than the RPR value. So they are not your friend. 

Also, this whole thesis is exactly the same as: “turbo tax will put CPA’s out of business”. It hasn’t. A good CPA will get you a much bigger return than the differential between their fee and the cost of Turbo Tax.

15,KW," Someone close to me has just moved on from working for a KW office. This person was not selling, but involved in hiring agents, training, growth etc. As an onlooker to this over the years, it has been clear to me that there is saturation the industry that is well-known. Talking to owners of franchises, they will tell you the high numbers are down to people who only sell two or three properties a year to people they know personally, as a side business. They also say that there are lots of bad realtors.

The trouble is, this sounds like a mini version of the multi-level marketing industry. Essentially, the risk of hiring a sales force is externalized onto candidates. Why does the profession not pay a salary? Because no business owner will take the risk that there is a sufficiently underserved market in any given area.

It has really made me double down on something I always have believed. If a job is not going to guarantee you some minimum salary, then unless there's equity or some other reward, it is probably not worth risking the opportunity cost.",PC_Speaker,12,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/olqhjh/zillow_is_aiming_to_kill_real_estate_agents/h5gw37x/,0.098,0.794,0.108,0.4902

It's part of the reason that a ton of agents are considered part-time.

Now it’s currently at about 300% but honestly even if it only does a paltry ( for Aapl) 20-25% which would put it behind fucking FB in terms of annual return I’ll still net between 200-300k of course it could go higher but that’s where I’m comfortable.,openthespread,10,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/om6fsb/trade_like_a_professional_breakout_swing_trading/h5jkol7/,0.019,0.888,0.092,0.8847

I had a feeling this week was not going to pan out like the last 3 (since the fucking fed was like ""whoops, inflations worse than we expected"") This has typically resulted in 2-300% gains by 2pm friday and its worked like clock work for 3 weeks now. But alas, all good things must come to an end. But hey, big tech earnings are coming up in the next 2 weeks so buy the dip for QQQ calls and cross your fingers these trillion+ dollar companies managed to not miss their numbers completely or mention anything about the fucking supply chain since doing so will negate any and all good news or wins mentioned in the meeting.   


Fun fact, this time last year the market took a shit monday afternoon after an amazing run up of QQQ. I learned that if you are up 2300% on your calls and have 45k from 1.2k invested, take the money and run, or else you will assume itll keep going up only to find out that having that celebratory lunch before cashing it all out just cost you 12 grand and think, itll recover.... i have 1 week left on these options right?   
then my AC in my house went out, so i cashed it all out only to see it immediately rally... But in the end it ended up just shitting the bed completely.

260,MU," And thats why its at a discount, but thats short sighted. Memory is a cycle with peaks and valleys, but is always on the way up. Old valleys micron would lose money on the year. Now their valley years are as profitable as their old average years. Their good years are going to boom. MU is only of the 3 to have increased market share in past couple years (sk hynix sucks), and the segment maturing still leaves an oligolopoly. Gonna be a long time before there is reduced demand for pc ram, auto chip ram, and data center storage. The technology doesn't really mature fully, they are constantly making faster and faster ram for gpus and servers.

It is a commodity and no one will ever care about the Micron brand, but need for that commodity is set to skyrocket in everything we own.

262,TSM," Couple reasons

1. Micron is far cheaper earnings wise. Its not very close either. This isn't entirely unwarranted as TSM is more exciting and has a near monopoly. But it is priced as such. Micron is priced like they ship fucking oil or bread or something. This lowers the downside and increases upside imo

2. U.S. based status. If the U.S. wants to more domestic chip manufacturing that includes Micron. It has to. Also included in all American ETFs. I dont believe Tsm is eligible for SPY and other index funds. Also no political shit where China is gonna invade headquarters.

3. Micron has enough cash and earnings they can force their valuation up. It is not impossible that they generate half their market cap in cashflow alone over the next 2 years.

For nearly EVERY amd, intel, nvidia, or tsm product it is requires their memory. Micron is one of the 3 that make it, and since the new CEO took over in 2017 they have improved their balance sheet and operations every year.",BobandSteve,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/olv4sd/mu_is_extremely_undervalued_and_set_for_a_big_year/h5iupy7/,0.077,0.861,0.062,-0.4124

268,CGC," Im eying the Weed sector since 3-4 years, been trading TLRY and CGC since about a year ago. It worked quite fine, until last week. 

Normally you see the dates (eg legalization in NY) and buy a week before that. The vote turns out as expected, the stock goes boom, you sell with 20-30% gains (dont get greedy). Easy. 

Last week, with the introduction of the Schumer bill, it went in a completely different direction as I had expected. With the denial from the White House, with was way too clear to think otherwise in short term, I got out asap. Lost about 6%. Smol losses eh.

Which brings us to the present. IMHO the sentiment, the wave of state legislation and the almost touchable federal legalization (which is terribly important bc of national banking regulations), has shifted against the companies.

I dont think that there will be a surprising legalization. Or anything anytime soon for that matter. The TLRY CEO kinda confirmed that by giving a timeline for about 2 yrs.

A lot of hopium was killed and the momentum has shifted. I dont think there will be any sustainable recovery without federal legalization news. And there will be none.

I just don't see a big company throwing 5B at TLRY right now to prop them. The landscape of politics, economics and just the COVID has cannabis sector as a real scary risk vs reward option. I had 8500 APHA @ 7.86 CAD NOV 2020 and did good FEB 2021. I held some obviously to today but sold over 75% in FEB.

316,RNG," Okay, let me explain it in very simple terms. The reason I think demand for RNG will increase, is because like I said, the Biden admin. is focussed on all the green shit. Once the economy opens back up properly, and I'm talking about the global economy, this will push up the demand for RNG. Simple logic. Higher demand, means higher price (depending on elasticity, I don't know this metric) and hence higher earnings.

I've been watching this stock for a long time. That's a bad position.  
First off, most of the pharmas, GILD included, have been trading sideways for awhile. That sector is just not leading the market right now nor has it been recently, so you're fighting against that sentiment and flow to being with.    
Second, you really need to see this thing move up through $70 before confirming any breakout of the current range, and it hasn't done that. Really no point in trying to get in beforehand while it's trading sideways - you'll still catch upside if you wait for confirmation before putting on a position and this way you'll not lose money to theta which you're setting yourself up for here. I'd also argue that you're not giving this enough time (especially since you're still _way_ early), and based on the closing price of those calls you need something like a %6 move to the upside before expiration _just to breakeven_, and while that's possible if you actually get a breakout above $70, until that breakout happens the probability of you making money on this trade is _very low_.",_foldLeft,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/olr573/gild_the_drug_company_not_the_same_gilead_from/h5ikcpe/,0.066,0.911,0.024,-0.8151

People were maxed out with home equity lines, 120% mortgages and the like, the GM debacle at the same time lost a lot of people their jobs (or VERY reduced incomes) and they couldn't make their payments especially if they had ARM's and their payments went up. Real estate prices dropped when people REALLY needed to sell or refinance and they could not because they were suddenly upside down in their debts. So they were foreclosed on and lost their entire initial investment. In theory, from purely a tax strategy, not a terrible one, you would have reduced your income tax while increasing an interest deduction (maybe). But it could open the gates of hell for you if economic conditions deteriorate. I would say don't gamble with losing your house. Play that part as safe as possible. Nobody wants to be homeless especially if you've known the joy of owning your own home vs rentals where the landlord decides if you can have a fish tank. Just my 2 cents. And it would depend on the interest rate on the Heloc, vs your 401k gains to see if it wasn't just a zero sum game. Currently Helocs are 3-5%ish, 401k gains are ballpark of 10-12%ish on average, so you'd really only be seeing a 5ish percent gain on 20k. I would vote No if my wife's boyfriend suggested it.",Puzzled_Raccoon8169,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/omam7k/does_this_make_sense_401k_and_heloc/h5jrpkg/,0.054,0.813,0.133,0.9679

383,CMA," Not licensed anymore but I was for some time. Licensees have a variety of responsibilities outside of unlocking a few doors and submitting an offer, paramount of which is managing your clients liabilities. Almost all MLS are closed systems, i.e. only the agents have access to full market information such as closed sales. Conducting a qualified CMA, in those markets, if very difficult for someone that doesn’t have access. Zestimates are garbage in most cases because Zillow aggregates sales data and applies that data in blanket fashion, so the pristine home and the crackhouse in the same neighborhood will seemingly have similar value. When I was licensed and I had a buyer that was looking for a specific home with specific characteristics I would go and preview properties ahead of showing so I could assess them correctly and make sure it was what they were really looking for, or that it didn’t have any glaring issues.

In my market a full time agent was expected, on average, to close 3-4 transactions per year. In a market where the median closing was around $200k that would amount to $24k gross before broker splits, if full commissions were realized (everything is negotiable.) Welcome to poverty. Yeah, there are teams that close hundreds per year, or independent agents that do dozens, but it’s not the norm. If I closed on a all cash transaction that waived inspections in 15 days you could say the compensation is excessive, but that balances with the clients that want to see 50 homes and take 6 months to finally close.",_Cbotz_,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oma9s6/in_response_to_the_idiot_who_decided_to_make_a/h5jpngv/,0.054,0.892,0.053,-0.2936

385,MLM," I went with a realtor, and it I had to do it again I would use the same realtor.

However, my realtor was competent. Most are not, which is why their is so much universal hate for them and the last post, posted by a moron who was duped by Zillow, still managed to get 20k upvotes.

It feels like realtor and MLM sales are the two professions incompetent people flock to the most when times are good. 

I will probably never not use a realtor when buying. However, fully understand the hate for them",msnebjsnsbek5786,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oma9s6/in_response_to_the_idiot_who_decided_to_make_a/h5jwy0i/,0.189,0.739,0.072,-0.9255
386,MA, Boston MA and Hoboken NJ both typically have 1 month rent as a brokerage fee for the tenant. Obv not all places have that but it severely limits your search (to probably about 1/10th of the options you have as you do with it).

387,WELL," I have done it both ways. Dabbled with flips and spec houses in early to mid 2000's pretty heavy. Did it both ways cuz some folks REFUSED to work with a realtor even if I paid them. It is a gigantic headache if you have other stuff you need to do besides work on crap for a closing. There's inspections and contracts and deed crap and mortgage crap and taxes and utilities crap. Good and bad are definitely out there, but reputations travel fast.
