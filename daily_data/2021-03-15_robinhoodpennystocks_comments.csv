170,SOS," I started out with $200 at the end of the first week of February. I usually split up my money among two to four positions of roughly even amounts. As my balance grew, I just increased the position size and stayed with less than five open positions at a time. I never held anything longer than two days. I just scalped my gain and moved on.

That worked really well. In 11 trading days, I was up 177%. Stupidly, I scrapped those tactics because I became enamored with with the blockchain and crypto mining sector... just in time for a damaging short report, the market correction, and bitcoin's pull back from $57k. Still trying to dig back out of that hole, as I'm now only up 158% over 26 trading days. But once SOS hits around $8.50, I'll be back to where I was.

I realize 177% isn't realistic to strive for in only two and a half weeks of trading, but I think splitting up evenly for four-five positions is your best bet for diversifying but not watering down.",badger0511,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m57unt/daily_discussion_thread/gr12n8z/,0.024,0.912,0.064,0.7962

188,SOS," You don't have to risk your entire portfolio on covered calls, and they can generate good extra gains if you play them properly.  

There are multiple ways to play them.  For example, I bought 100 shares of UXIN on 3/7 at 1.15 and then sold a $1 3/19 call for .30 ($30) premium.  I expect the call to be exercised and shares taken for $100 ($1 x 100).  Doing this, I made $15 ($100 sell of stock +$30 call premium - $115 stock purchase).  Overall, 13% gain on a 12 day trade.  If you have a larger account, maybe you do 10 contracts and make $150.

I also bought SOS at \~$8.  I am using this to sell covered calls against weekly or bi-weekly.  I sold 3/26 $12.5 call this morning for $30 meaning if the shares are called away, I make \~$4.50 per share x 100 plus the premiums for selling the calls which is roughly $200 so far.

Just remember options contracts are against 100 shares and can be a good way to supplement your portfolio gains and you only have to put up what you are comfortable with from your portfolio, not the entire thing.

Also remember, we are in this to make money so don't start falling in love with certain stocks and never wanting to let them go.",Busy_Print6699,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m57unt/daily_discussion_thread/gr0ut9w/,0.0,0.817,0.183,0.989

253,AGTC," There’s a lot of reasons honestly. First of all this isn’t my job, it’s something I’m doing on the side for fun and to make money.

All that said, I’m not totally sure how much I believe in fundamentals as a great indicator. Fidelity has agtc listed as bearish with a terrible rating (which I believe is based on fundamentals analysis), meanwhile I’m up about 10% with AGTC across all of my brokerages.
