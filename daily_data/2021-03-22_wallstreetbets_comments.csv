🚀 **Live Thread**

**4:40 Update**

Sorry for the late update. Work had picked up significantly.

Nothing really changed since the last update. It seemed like some thing was pushing up, but it didn't continue after hours.

Enjoy the break while it lasts!

Current price: 194.48

**3:40 Update**

I may not get a chance to update right immediately after close, so I just wanted to give some thoughts if things stay like this.

I feel like the HFs made a strong push to get GME under 200. GME held on for 20 minutes before finally breaking the barrier. After GME stabalized, the HF fired another attack which brought it down to the 193 region. The rest of the day has been quite dull. We saw two whales which brought the price up to 196, but it's slowly settled back down to around 193.

There's just no volume. Nobody is making a move. It feels like not a lot of people are taking stock of what happens today and tomorrow until earnings are announced. It feels like a 4 day weekend.

Tomorrow might be just as slow.

Current price: 192.51

**3:30 Update**

Slight downward momentum so far. It seems consistent, but it might still be general volatility. Shorts available hasn't changed.

I'm not going to do a stock that Reddit is seriously looking at. I don't want anyone assuming that I know what I'm talking about and potentially make a bad decision.

I want a random stock nobody knows anything about that has some hilarious volatility.

Current price: 193.18

**3:05 Update**

Still pretty steady. It seemed like it was going up, but it's more likely just general volatility.

This might be a really boring Power Hour unless west coast retail makes a move during their lunch.

Anyone have a request for stock to watch while we wait for earnings?

Current price: 194.68

**2:39 Update**

GME stabalized again at around 194. That second jump seems like it might've been another whale! 🐳🐳

Power hour is coming up, let's see if GME can make it's way back to 200.

I don't know if a significant portion of people would care if GME ends in the 195 region. Again, it seems that most people are waiting until earnings to make a move. 

Honestly, I feel like HFs wasted their shorts today. If earnings come out great, HFs won't have as much ammo to stop a potential strong post earnings rally.

Current price: 193.53

**2:14 Update**

GME is rising! If GME finishes above 200, I will laugh. They'll have used 100,000 shorts and it would have effectively done nothing.

Current price: 194.65

**1:55 Update**

Whale sighting?

Small price and volume jump at 1:30. Stock went up by around $5. Either a small whale or someone closed some shorts.

If the whale is reading this, hello whale! 🐳 

Current price: 191.50

**1:34 Update**

The reason why earnings will be a reset is because the entire Bull Thesis is based on an assumption of what Ryan Cohen will do with the company. Earnings is a time where focus will be on what the company says. They might start showing their hand which could strengthen or weaken the bull thesis.

Nobody is really doing anything at the moment because most people have made up their mind with the current available information. There are a lot of people including whales that haven't made up their mind on the matter and are waiting until tomorrow.

I have no idea what's going to happen. I'm afraid to even speculate based on previous earnings reports with other companies. This situation is really quite unique, so we don't really have anything to look back on that can give us an idea of what may happen.

GME seems to have stablized again. There's a decent chance we might be chilling like this for the rest of the day.

Current price: 189.80

**1:27 Update**

GME has been slowly trending down. It's broken 190 and it's currently around 188.

Before anyone panics, please realize that volume is VERY low. It seems that a lot of people are waiting until Wednesday. EVERYONE is going to reevaluate GMEs value then, and we'll get a MUCH clearer idea of what the general sentiment is. I doubt that these two days are really going to affect what happens on Wednesday, regardless of which direction it goes.

Current price: 188.38

**1:12 Update**

Another dip pushed GME below 190, but it bounced back, hanging around 191. Shorts available for GME remained the same. I don't have the ability to calculate synthetic shorts (from ETFs), so I don't know what that situation for that looks like right now. 

I still don't know if they're playing for 175. These past two dips seem like their testing to see how effective their shorts are at the moment. They might be doing this to see if they even have the capabilities to hit 175. 

Volume seems very low, which tells me that retail didn't do much during lunch. A lot of people may be waiting for earnings to decide what to do.

I personally am waiting until after earnings to try and get a bearing on what the direction of this week will be. So many different things can happen that these two days kind of feel pointless. 

I want volatility!

Shorts available: 100,000

Current price: 189.74

**12:35 Update**

One thing I missed in my previous update was that HFs took out another 50,000 shorts.

I wasn't paying attention until now because I didn't see any actual dip. There was an interesting dip from 194 to 191. Those might have been part of the 50,000. If they used everything, they've spent 100,000 to drop the price by 4.15%. At this rate, I dont think they can make it to 175. If they can't make it to 175, I don't see any real point for then to try to push the price lower. It would make more sense for them to conserve what they have and just make sure the price stays under 200. If they run out of ammo and GME begins to skyrocket, they won't have a way to stop GME from compounding Gamma Squeezes. There's still a lot of opportunities for GME to grow, a lot of time left this week, and a possibly huge catalyst with earnings.

If GME starts pushing down towards 180, things would get really interesting, however it hasn't broken 190 yet.

Shorts available: 100,000

Current price: 191.30

**12:07 Update**

Lunch time. GME might do something soon?

It's eerily calm right now. After all the volatility we've seen towards the end of last week, I can't tell if things are setttling down for a bit or if this is the eye of the hurricane.

Current price: 194.23

**11:46 Update**

While we wait for something to happen, I figured it might be fun to start a discussion.

**3/23** [Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-earnings)

Following that announcement we can expect to hear about a replacement for their CFO, the *possibility* that Ryan Cohen may be taking a new role within Gamestop, and with the end of the pre-earnings blackout period Gamestop will be free to announce any transition initiatives moving forward.

*A note on earnings:* **Gamestop's fiscal year runs through January**. So the Q4 report will include holiday sales, the console release, increased offerings of PC parts, and any additional sales driven through Jan from suddenly getting a ton of free press and consumer goodwill.

184,GME," Think of it like this:  


Say you own 10 shares totaling $2000   


1 share of GME = $200 currently  
10 for 1 split = 10 shares at $20  


Now you have 100 shares totaling $2000  


So say shares are trading for $20 now.  Stock price after split is cheaper and more appealing so more people start buying in and that $20 price jumps up to $100.  You now have 100 shares totaling $10000.  


In reverse, 100 shares totaling $10000 before the split would have equaled 1 share = $1000.

And yes split math above is correct. But the FOMO majority has obsession with cheap stocks.

Anyone could have bought a share of TSLA at 2000 but because price was so high people go buy a different stock cause instead of 1 share they could get 10 and that feels like more. Their wrong but it does feel that way.

TSLA at 1600 announces split. Hits 2000 pre split. Now it’s 400 and it only took a few months to shoot up to 800-900 now the market widely expects the price around 700.

Can you elaborate on the fractional shares being available to lend = the screwing the small guy.

I think we are both correct.
Mathematically, TSLA should not have been valued  higher after the split. But that's not how people react to the lower price, people are not rational.

I work in corporate for a top 5 property and casualty insurer.
We were recently told that splitting our stock was unlikely because of the corporate resources required verse the benefit.

You will mitigate losses but you’ll also mitigate gains. It’s a way to get in and out of the market with minimal risk. But the market historically goes up in the long term so spending time out of the market-regardless what the charts say- is foolish if your goal is to make money. 

It’s ironic that traders (the group of people whom often have the highest risk tolerance) choose to use TA (a strategy which fundamentally speaking carries some of the lowest risk tolerance). But it’s for this exact reason that traders on average will underperform the market. Buying at support and selling at resistance leaves almost no room for volatility.

270,TA," I'm not a huge TA person but I believe there is something to support and resistance points, I've seen it play out many times and I've based decision from it in many cases. 

I'm no expert, but I believe the right approach is to follow the same group of stocks over time to get a feel for what high or low is. In a way, your ""gut feeling"" becomes more or less than same as the support and resistance points. I've noticed that if I'm looking at any particular stock for the first time, even using TA I still don't feel confident in what a ""normal"" price is, or where the support and resistance points are. Sure I can use TA but I don't trust what I'm seeing.  Even scrolling through different time frames, zooming in and out, I still feel like I'm about to step on a land mine if I haven't followed it before. But if you're watching a stock closely day by day for a couple months, you know where the support and resistance really is, regardless of what any TA on a chart is showing you. You roughly know it rarely goes below $12 or above $15, and you know once it goes to $16, back to $15 and the to $17, it's reached new territory and you recalibrate to it's new normal range.

294,GME," I like how GME is a great beginners stock. ""Is this a dip?"" Stock goes down 15% in 30 seconds, then takes a break for 5 minutes to let my brain adjust. Then it goes down an other 15%. At this point I have had time to recognize the dip, sell some other stock and buy when it begins to rise again.

I've also heard that the squeeze can last for days like VW did. I might be able to catch that one too. =)

298,GME," I found a cheap mining stock with a recent IPO and saw they had experienced successful management from other connected industries and bought it last week. I'm up 8% already and that's just the start.

Technicals my ass. GME closed in the red at the latest psychological milestone of $200 and dipped under it significantly twice in the past week. That told me it was going down because panic sellers won't have confidence in a solid floor at $200 and they're afraid of the next psychological milestone down so they sell. I predicted that and now GME held under the $200 psychological milestone for the past 3 hours.

301,TA," while I’ve been involved in the stock market more these past months I have been noticing a lot of the variables between ppl who make money and those who lose it. I wouldn’t say the stock market is gambling like the lottery system. But ppl tend to let it become that way without realizing it. My first job was working at a gas station so I sold scratchers. I noticed many thought they had a system to winning and would bet on their system to work. But they never do, they always lose and think it just didn’t work this time. But some were smarter than others, they knew most of it was a game of odds. If someone had $100 to spend they would buy nothing more then scratchers worth $5 and their chances of winning back all their money was much higher than someone who blew all that money on just one scratcher worth $100 (these ppl were always the biggest idiots of them all, cus 9/10 times these were the ppl who believed in their systems religiously). This is how I see it with the stock market, the biggest losers are the ones who spend too much on one play thinking it’s gonna be the one that makes them a millionaire. There will always be exceptions but the odds are rarely in your favor. TA can be great but to a certain degree it begins to form the same thought pattern involved with gamblers who believe they have a system. TA can be a very useful tool but never risk so much money based on TA alone. And don’t sell it all as soon as you get in the red. That’s another factor. Emotions play a big factor in winners vs losers. Ppl should learn to separate emotions from rational thinking. It’s a skill worth learning and I believe these are the most successful ppl in general. But if you’re on wsb than you most likely don’t care about rational thinking 😂I mean I am holding on to gme but that’s the only non rational thing I’ll ever participate in again.

314,TA," if this were true, this would be true. but trading is actually 80% psychology, 20% mechanics. this is why people were successful trading for centuries before we ever had charts. dudes used to stare at ticker tapes and make money.

the best book on trading psychology is arguably ""Trading in the Zone"" by Mark Douglas. Best practice is to read (or listen to the audiobook \*wink\*) until one has it memorized.

trading is easy, you can literally flip a coin and make money, if your risk management is tight. most traders act on the erroneous belief that if they become better analysts, they will make money. many traders are exceptional analysts, but they lose because they never master their emotions. the markets are some of the last few places on earth that allow for unlimited freedom of creative expression. this freedom is what permits people to fail epically, in a society that largely thrives on imposing limitations.

TA works consistently. Your emotions do not. Master the latter, the former works for you.

I can prove ta works. TA is just behavioral analysis. This post will be downvoted because I'm saying TA works. These ignorant fucks go right past the 'trading is 80% psychology', and go right to what triggers them. So I'll say it again:

TA works, TA works really well. And risk management is far, far more important. It's why there's so much glorious loss porn in this sub. People lose all their money because their risk management is shit. If your risk management is shit, learning TA will only make trading more frustrating, because you'll go into profit *more* often, and then give it all back.",tianavitoli,10,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mabmyk/youre_buying_based_on_gut_feeling_selling_on_gut/grtdrzn/,0.152,0.679,0.17,0.8888

Again, your statement shows you're the epitome of the type of people I was referring to. It is not supposed to concretely predict the future, as opposed to simply giving someone a slight statistical advantage in regards to short term trends.

You can dig your head in the sand as deep as you'd like, but the proof is out there regardless.

341,TA," These are very well known basic ideas known as resistance and support levels.

Look, at the end of the day, you either believe in facts and pay attention to the supporting evidence or you dig your head in the sand. There are plenty of scientific studies that show TA provides a statistical advantage over a basic buy and hold strategy. TA and fundamental analysis are not opposite ends of a magnet... They can co-exist, and the best strategies use both.

385,AMC," It goes a bit beyond this actually - It also allows the market maker to decide whether they want to take the REVERSE of the trade... which is important because people like citadel with enough capital can use this to HOLD A STOCK PRICE FLAT.

Scenario:

Buy order comes in for GME through order flow.

Citadel decides to step in front of the trade and take the exact order, but in the opposite direction (short).

Instead of buying from the open market of shares, it is the equivalent of Citadel borrowing the share and giving it to you at that price instead. Resulting in no change to the underlying stock price.

Why would Citadel do this? Certainly it just exposes them to a ton of risk as they are taking the reverse of all of these orders? The answer is CONTROLLING VOLATILITY and PERCEPTION.

Reason 1. Robinhood can make the claim very publicly ""When you place an order with Robinhood, you own the shares. Period"". Umm yes we do, but our buy order was Citadel's sell order. They are TECHNICALLY correct, but placing orders for stock on pay for order flow systems allows your buy order to do NOTHING to the underlying as long as Citadel is willing to front the capital to keep the stock price flat.

So why do it? Controlling volatility is incredibly profitable. Citadel can now take a recently volatile stock like GME / AMC and make it trade flat. They can write MASSIVE amounts of puts / calls knowing they will never be ITM because they control the stock price. It is a free infinite money code.

BUT - Two things happen. One, they have themselves at risk because their short exposure goes THROUGH THE ROOF while they are playing these games - and two, it becomes less profitable for them over time as volatility drops and the premiums they receive go down. SO, it must go in cycles - a cycle of writing OTM options and receiving large amounts of profit - followed by a cycle of unloading their shorts and 'allowing' the stock price to skyrocket.

I believe this is the game they are playing - and volatility will be 'not worth it to them' after earnings because of the IV drop.

BUT - Two things happen. One, they have themselves at risk because their short exposure goes THROUGH THE ROOF while they are playing these games - and two, it becomes less profitable for them over time as volatility drops and the premiums they receive go down. SO, it must go in cycles - a cycle of writing OTM options and receiving large amounts of profit - followed by a cycle of unloading their shorts and 'allowing' the stock price to skyrocket.

I believe this is the game they are playing - and volatility will be 'not worth it to them' after earnings because of the IV drop.

387,SO," It goes a bit beyond this actually - It also allows the market maker to decide whether they want to take the REVERSE of the trade... which is important because people like citadel with enough capital can use this to HOLD A STOCK PRICE FLAT.

Scenario:

Buy order comes in for GME through order flow.

Citadel decides to step in front of the trade and take the exact order, but in the opposite direction (short).

Instead of buying from the open market of shares, it is the equivalent of Citadel borrowing the share and giving it to you at that price instead. Resulting in no change to the underlying stock price.

Why would Citadel do this? Certainly it just exposes them to a ton of risk as they are taking the reverse of all of these orders? The answer is CONTROLLING VOLATILITY and PERCEPTION.

Reason 1. Robinhood can make the claim very publicly ""When you place an order with Robinhood, you own the shares. Period"". Umm yes we do, but our buy order was Citadel's sell order. They are TECHNICALLY correct, but placing orders for stock on pay for order flow systems allows your buy order to do NOTHING to the underlying as long as Citadel is willing to front the capital to keep the stock price flat.

Seriously though, commission free trade is fair for retail if they have a small account that makes small trades.

You will never get sold to higher than 1% above best available price so, it works better than a $5 commission. Your biggest danger is if you limit buy and nail the bottom, your order just won’t execute. On the other hand if you’re buying in $ amounts significantly higher than that yes you’re getting fucked and you should probably move to IBKR which has a much different model for ordering.

Pretend the price of a stock is $469 And they tell the big hedge funds, ""Hey, looks like we have a 100, 000 shares with a limit to sell at $450""

The hedge fund can drive the price down to $450, to trigger the stop losses and limit sells. The information they have from our small brokers allows them to predict how their movements will affect the rest of the numbers.  After the orders trigger at $450 the price gets driven down to $435, then they buy up more shares than they sold moving the market. Now the price is $460 and tons of ppl just sold for losses at $450.

Yes PFOF is gay, but it comes benefits especially if you want to scalp trade or leverage stocks you already have a position in on other brokers. With that in mind, I'm entirely OK with PFOF on WealthSimple because MarketMakers in Scoitabank (alledgley) get less than what a Citadel makes. Commercial law regulations on banks make payment for order flow harsher on taxes thus what they get paid out is entirely smaller in sum.

452,IMO," I think most people feel pretty strongly about 100% digital or 100% physical. In my case it has to do more with the type of game. I own most of the ""party games"" physical, however I don't think there is any benefit in doing so. The rationale being, the game play is essentially limitless. RPG type games without a lot of replayability on the other hand, should ALWAYS be physical IMO. Either to lend to a friend or trade in/sell. 

Another anecdotal scenario is people with low grade broadband. My brother is on Satellite internet. It's good enough for his gaming needs, but slow enough to be burdensom to download games/patches. He can drive the 15 minutes to Target (no local GameStop) purchase a game and drive home faster than downloading.

532,GME," *When you buy this stock you're joining a battle*

This is such a horrible piece of advice for inexperienced traders. New traders have a hard enough time sticking to a trading plan that's actually based on technicals and fundamentals.

This piece of advice is, irrespective of Gamestop or any specific stock, the most important thing for traders to follow: develop a thesis and plan **BEFORE** you open any position. Once you've opened a position, as long as nothing material has happened that would change your thesis and plan, **stick to your plan**. 

Your thesis can be that GME is going to squeeze like never before. Your plan can be that you're going to hold until that happens. That's fine. But that doesn't have to be your thesis or your plan. You could decide to scalp the volatility, in which case you need to actively watch for resistance and support. *""But day traders are hurting the squeeze.""* I don't give a fuck. Nobody, not a single person, gives a shit about your position. If GME goes sideways, these apes aren't going to save your investment. If everyone on this sub agrees not to day trade GME, it's not going to erradicate day trading on GME.

When you open a position, have a reason for doing so. That reason being a movement *could* work out. But if that's your only reason, then you have no plan and the chances of you panic selling or buying at terrible entries are pretty high.

Apologize for the rant, but someone needs to counteract all the shitty advice people are giving to brand new traders. Nobody is going to alter their strategies to help your position work out. Nobody. So you shouldn't be either. Make investments that *you* think are good investments, and stick to *your* plan.",AJDillonsMiddleLeg,52,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mauzod/to_all_those_thinking_of_buying_amc_andor_gme/gruogix/,0.07,0.845,0.085,0.4418

544,GS," It's not going to happen, greed won't let it. In theory if all the FTD's get called and are forced to eliminate and everyone held then the stock could go to whatever price anyone who is willing to sell. The problem is you end up with people willing to sell at 500$ because they bought in at 30$ and can become a millionaire. They are going to do that.  The price falls. This process keeps repeating. There is no honor among thieves and everyone is a thief. No one wants to be left holding the bag. 1. GS may still do quite well over the long haul. 2. Ideally those who have already made significant profits should let weaker investors profit but that won't happen because even if one could enforce it. 3. One still has to compete with hedge funds who will take profit too. If someone is buying up all the stock and has the bankroll to do it (70M \* 500$ = 3.5B to 50B(for FTD's)) then they can cut the supply to 0  and any shorters will have to cover at whatever cost.

Everyone wants to profit and no one wants to lose. There are people who made significant amount of money and can get in now and still make a lot. If apes really cared for each other the ones that have made large amounts of profit should hold out the longest and let the people with their one shares sell to make more profit(this way they can come back with more ammo if the shorters come around for another wave).

Remember, the HF's own most of the stock so they will ultimately try to sell each other out. Depending on what they expect can happen they might ""collude"" to let the price skyrocket though. I'm sure they got several projections going... The HF's have no problem screwing retail.

Tomorrow will say a lot and allow better projections. People are going to sell, it's not about logic and math but about emotions and trust, neither of which can be trusted.

&#x200B;

Ideally apes would form their own hedge fund, pool in their money in to various zones and fight fire with fire. Profits and losses are in proportion to what you invest. The money is used to short the hell out of HF's to drive them in to oblivion and to support companies that are good for society.",EternalDissonance,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mauzod/to_all_those_thinking_of_buying_amc_andor_gme/grugp6z/,0.109,0.757,0.135,0.9353

I'm personally not worried about the dilution vote because 1.) The vote is in May (grow a pair, Jesus),  2.) The released statement says that they will begin auditing the shares once the vote begins...meaning that any naked shorting will be revealed and heavily fined...so there's that possible catalyst that will launch the price up before then when the naked shorts need to cover.

611,AMC," I can easily argue the companies value with you.  

We obviously can not judge the companies value by last year considering COVID shut theaters down (yes it cost the company money that we have to take into consideration).  So lets look at the previous year.  In the spring/summer time of 2019, AMC stock was being sold at $14 to $16.50 per share.  The hedge funds heavily shorted AMC stock late 2019, and drove the price down, then COVID hit.  This caused the company value to go down even further with costs piling up, and low to zero income.

Us retail investors saw the shorts occurring and bought into the company which helped prevent it from going bankrupt.  Now that theaters are opening up (albeit at a lower capacity) they are being sold out.  People have been cooped up at home for over a year now and are yearning to get back to the theater.  Hollywood is also sitting on quite a few movies that they have had to push the release date back on. This is going to provide an influx of business as things open up more, and I believe the increase in business will counter-act the losses from the previous year.  On top of that AMC has a streaming service out, which is also providing an income.  Given this information, I believe the stock is easily worth $15 to $20 per share.

With the hedge funds heavily shorting the stock and people like me who have faith in the company, and buying/holding shares, I think the price will go up significantly past the $15 to $20 per share, but will eventually settle back down.

That is the reason I invested.  Could I be wrong, sure.  Crayons have zero health benefit, but that doesn't stop me from eating them.",gegroff,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mauzod/to_all_those_thinking_of_buying_amc_andor_gme/gruoz75/,0.042,0.847,0.111,0.9097

684,DD," While earnings have lately been when most stocks shit the bed, this one could go either way. To my understanding, basically we haven't seen major price increases because of low volume. Usually such low volume would lead to big price drops, but gme seems to hold very well, even after the huge sells of the last couple weeks. Other people have posted DD on here about how any newsworthy announcements about the company since January have caused really nice spikes in share price.

This earnings report, and more importantly, shareholder meeting could have announcements in it that would cause another price spike. Announcement of new cfo, cohen perhaps taking a management position, or best of all, the return of dividends! All of these things and more could cause a spike in volume on Wednesday. With this stock, high volume = higher volitility, but also Generally leads to price rocketing. 

It could be more wishful thinking. It could be just another random event people want to pretend will cause the squeeze, but I am not looking for freak occurrences anymore. I am buying on super low volume days, preferably on dips, and patiently waiting for the volume to increase and the price to shoot up.

852,BBBY," Um I can tell you exactly what happened. Starting around the 10th or 15th of January a lot of heavily shorted stocks started to squeeze. GME being most obvious example but it was across the board. As you noted, FIZZ. IRBT, BBBY, GSX etc. By Jan 20th Melvin was already down about -10% on the month and other HFs that were short these “crowded shorts” were hurting as well. They all started slowly deleveraging (selling longs and covering shorts). 

Other hedge funds and quants noticed (whether an actual human noticed or computers noticed doesn’t matter) and started piling into the other side of these trades. Basically all Melvin’s shorts went up and their longs went down. EXPE, LB, PINS, BKNG all were under selling pressure.

They had to keep deleveraging and it turned into a downward spiral, exacerbated by other HFS in crowded names doing the same thing and then OTHER hedge funds piling in to cause a pain trade. That’s how Melvin lost 53%. It wasn’t all GME. Other hedge funds like Maplelane and D1 also got crushed (source: WSJ).

No, they lost $6B because every trade went against them and that is not something you would expect in your risk models (which assume if your shorts are up then SOME of your longs are going to be up. Or as you said, that IRBT, FIZZ, and GME, 3 completely different companies in different industries, don’t have a high correlation to each other)

935,SE," I'm using the EUR numbers here and referring to PAH3, which has the same underlying. Based on EUR 93 share price, Porsche SE has 28.48b market cap. They own 53.30% of the ORDINARY shares of Volkswagen.

VW has 295m ordinary shares. Based on a EUR 310 share price that worth 91.48b.

53.30% of 91.48b is 48.75b, which is 71% higher than the current market cap of Porsche SE.

Based on this my math shows that Porsche SE should be trading at EUR 159 instead of EUR 93 ONLY based on the value of their VW shares (they own a lot other stuff as well).

Is it, though?  It's not like you can cash out your Porche SE stake and receive payment in an equivalent number of VW.

Holding Porsche SE means you not only ""own"" a slice of their stake in VW, you also ""own"" a slice of whatever net-negative value assets (including debt) that is dragging their share price down relative to VW.

This isn't an arbitrage of relative mispricing between Porsche and VW; it's a bet that Porsche's liabilities and associated risk are being overvalued by the market.

The latter is likely also the reason for the discount in the shares Porsche SE owns, because the German state of Lower-Saxony owns 20.2% of shares. However, there is also a federal law specifically aimed at VW that states that no party other may exercise more than 20% of voting rights.

That's 7900 OTM contracts that are new today. Given RKT's low delta, that's probably another 500k shares that have not been purchased if a gamma squeeze happens. Sadly, I forgot to SS the OTM puts so can't be more accurate.

There is 74% institutional ownership, so using that as a proxy for dividend reinvestment with 113M shares float, that's 4M shares that need to be purchased. 

Shorts have obtained shares that are about inline (6M vs 4M) with dividend reinvestment purchases, so hopefully we get someone buying in heavy tomorrow (share buyback maybe?). Shorts will be out of ammo and MMs will have to buy shares. If a bill appears for first time home buyer credit, that will also do it.

As an investment, the stock has potential. Their market share will likely grow. Now that rates have increased, people won’t refinance away from them.

When you do further research, you realize that's it not about the money with them, they are passionate about growing the company and restoring Detroit (Esp. Dan Gilbert, the founder and majority shareholder).

So I imagine you're saying that once the Re-investment starts, people would start dumping their shares and there would be a larger pool to borrow from, but the reality is wallstreet, for one reason or another, has severely mispriced this stock. People who bought it know this, insiders know this, hell, even the shorters know it, but they can't let it go up because too many calls have already been sold. 

The fair value of the stock (given current market conditions) is actually a lot higher, so no, I don't believe anyone will be dumping their shares of an undervalued stock.

If they restructured compensation plans to be less direct pay and more equity based, then the bonus makes sense given the stock price has gone through the roof this year.

1641,BCRX," This is BS. If I recall correctly, Novartis's most profitable drug was/is Gleevec which is used to treat CML, which is a rare disease. The annual cost of the drug is about $100k. Guess what, insurance pays for it.

With the drug BCRX has, even if the disease is rarer, still insurance pays for this stuff so pretty much everyone can afford it. The question is whether they choose this course of treatment or an alternative. Since all the options are insanely expensive, BCRX does not have pressure to sell it for cheap. Frankly they should make some good money on it as otherwise no one would waste the money going bankrupt trying to find these drugs.

About the history, I am not familiar, but there is always that possibility. That said, the drug I made some effort to research is Berotralstat which has passed approval already and even if a fraction of the people with HAE use it (say 15%, which seems very reasonable to me) the company net of expenses will easily make between $500M+ (between, US, Japan, Europe at a net profit of $150K per patient... the retail price for these drugs can be well over $300K a year) a year.

1643,ALL," Let me say three things then about Gleevac.

How much does insurance cover in US, Canada, Europe? All of it, most of it? Because it definitely isn't ALL of it. At the same time, there is a cap on what insurance covers yearly depending on what country you are in. Insurance needs to cover ALL health needs, not just 1 drug.

Second, how much value did Gleevec bring to Novartis stock? It seems like approval date was 2001...
I checked Novartis price history. It split twice, once in 2000 (2:1) and one in 2019 (1116:1000). The latter one is meh... Overall, it doesn't seem THAT much.. but then again, I'm not a follower of Novartis stock for the past two decades.

Third, Gleevec does not seem to be Novartis biggest revenue bringer. This agrees with my notion that rare diseases aren't THAT profitable. It might have been previously, but not now apparently. https://www.statista.com/statistics/278114/novartis-top-drugs-based-on-revenue/.

Finally, with regards to Berotralstat... I'm not exactly sure what you want from me? The stock went from $4 to $10-12. That gain is due to Berotralstat getting approved. In terms of whether it's better or worse than what's already present (AKA beat out competition)... I don't know.

Again, you'd have to compare efficiency and effectiveness with other competitors in the market to convince me. And you should consider upcoming new competitors.

Thus, I still stand by my reasoning that a significant portion of this DD and the final speculated value is overexaggerated. This doesn't mean that I think that the price is fair (I can envision spiking up a bit higher), it just mean that I don't believe the numbers mentioned here ($180+).

As far as FB, they're adding 10k jobs and possibly another 5, looking to buy smaller companies/tech, and still has what, 3 billion users? 


Tech stocks may be rounding the corner, and are definitely becoming value stock that are long term wealth builders. After all, the market only goes up! Just look at Momma Cath and her outlook for Tesla.

1667,GEVO," Of course - they sold some fuel to airlines that bought less because of Covid. But does it really matter if it goes down in these ranges? I mean this is obviously not a stock that is measured by its revenue. It's measured by its future potential, which is huge. If you do a little bit of research you'll find that they have

\- A ton of cash

\- A ton of IP

\- A ton of contracts worth billions per year

\- Very concrete plans

I'm not here to convince anybody, but still nobody gives a damn about $GEVO. You'll find there's almost no posts about it - it's not on people's radar. IMHO a huge catalyst will be end of month institutional ownership reporting. If my sense is right, it will have increased significantly from 6,22% and we'll see a huge gap up. I believe GEVO at the moment is worth between $20 and $30 and within 5 years it might be between $75 and $150.

One plant has projected net income of $70 million. With 7 plants planned, 30 EPS and \~200 million outstanding shares, we're at $70 mlilion \* 7 \* 30 / 200 million \~$75, more if things go well, worse if they don't. I'll give them a 20% failure rate at this point. They might fuck up the planning this year or the execution the year after, but if they are successful, they will be huge. Now I don't know if they'll take off any time soon, but volume is picking up and as I mentioned I believe institutional investors got in on the last dip, but well if I'm wrong, I still have the 13k shares for the longer term. This is just a YOLO.
