In exchange we got a section of wall at the yard, sanctioned zones in the city, trains we could write on and bomb without fear of criminal prosecution.  I mean they knew who we all were by name but they couldn't really stop us you know so they compromised with us, but in the end it just felt like a win for us and we played along and did our own thing with the added bonus of having that stuff they ""gave"" to us priced in as people would say here.

He can do two things:

1. Buy 100 stocks for 1200 dollars (per call) and do whatever he wants with them, if he chose to exercise the call today and sell instantly, he could pay 1200 bucks and sell them for 23 600, thus make neat 22.4k profit per call. Or he could just hold onto the stocks cause he likes it, whatever.

2. He could sell the call contracts directly, thus allowing someone else to exercise and cash them in as in point 1. He would never need to provide the cash (1200 per call) to pay for them, as he doesn't exercise the call.

Edit 2: Hey everyone, haven't been this overwhelmed in over 5 years of joining Reddit. I am at work this whole time, well, trying to concentrate at least :D :D. Thank you all for all the jokes and comments. My gf is new to reddit and I have been trying to convey this excitement to her over whatsapp video-call, since she lives far away. Gotta go for another work-meeting.

Wish you all good luck, make some tendies, and have fun. In good spirit. Bless you all.

Edit 3: Haha, for all the speculations out there, I'm originally from Asia, came to Europe quite some time ago for better life. It has been a hell of a ride and I am happy for all the gonna-be millionaires as well as anyone on the journey. I joined this sub during the January frenzy and have learned a lot. GME is also the reason my gf got into reddit in the first place, cause she was really curious. And only yesterday I checked out the random avatar generator for the first time and that's why my avatar looks like that.

He met my grandmother because her family owned a store and would give his mom their extra food when my grandfather's father was too drunk to work. Because of his early experiences, my grandfather was famously cheap when it came to himself, but he spent on his family. He was missing teeth purely because he didn't think he'd be alive long enough to justify a visit to the dentist. He passed away a little under 2 weeks ago, 2 days after I finally started seeing green in my account again. I was emotionally wrecked and in a panic attack I sold to lock in my gains. Then, the next trading day I bought back in and used my gains to buy a couple more shares. I missed out on $12 of growth, but oh well. I was so nervous on the flight to his funeral that I couldn't look at my portfolio that I almost got sick on the plane.

Looking at the media, they have decided to seem like they are long on GME and are using Cohen's appointment as the catalyst behind the rise. All that is done to hide, cover and hush hush the new SEC ruling about clearing. That is where the beast lays:

Everybody who is serious about the stock knows that there are more shares being traded daily than the actual shares, about 4 times as much, yes, that much. This is a huge problem, it is so big that no media outlet dares to touch that actual story. The 21-day rollover rule has created imaginary shares that have been 'failed to deliver' by shorts for months, maybe more.

Options being written on shares that writers are told they own but in reality do not because they haven't been delivered by shorts to the clearing house is a fat big problem that threatens the whole financial system. This is much bigger than we think. What happens then is that brokers get caught in the middle. When the clearing house can not provide the actual stocks to brokers who have paid for them and told their customers they own the stock, we have serious fraud on the table.

There is going to be a responsible party for those imaginary shares. It will certainly not be retail holders, brokers will start buying the shorts into the stock to save themselves from being the responsible party. The SEC and the clearing house is no way going to be left holding the bag, that is too much responsibility and it would collapse the entire market.

Thus, the 2-day ruling. It is an incredibly important piece of news that everybody is trying to hide from the people and attention.  What is happening here is historic. As the price of GME goes up, the magnitude of the problem gets massive as the amount of money that cannot be accounted for gets huge.

I think this is just the tip of the iceberg. $1000 is not a meme, $2000 is around the corner, $5000 is no joke at all. Hold. You are witnessing one of the greatest stories of capitalism. This is getting serious.

Credit to the original author, whomever you are. Not financial advice, crayons taste delicious. I personally like the stock. 


'Looking at the media, they have decided to seem like they are long on GME and are using Cohen's appointment as the catalyst behind the rise. All that is done to hide, cover and hush hush the new SEC ruling about clearing. That is where the beast lays:

Everybody who is serious about the stock knows that there are more shares being traded daily than the actual shares, about 4 times as much, yes, that much. This is a huge problem, it is so big that no media outlet dares to touch that actual story. The 21-day rollover rule has created imaginary shares that have been 'failed to deliver' by shorts for months, maybe more.

Options being written on shares that writers are told they own but in reality do not because they haven't been delivered by shorts to the clearing house is a fat big problem that threatens the whole financial system. This is much bigger than we think. What happens then is that brokers get caught in the middle. When the clearing house can not provide the actual stocks to brokers who have paid for them and told their customers they own the stock, we have serious fraud on the table.

There is going to be a responsible party for those imaginary shares. It will certainly not be retail holders, brokers will start buying the shorts into the stock to save themselves from being the responsible party. The SEC and the clearing house is no way going to be left holding the bag, that is too much responsibility and it would collapse the entire market.

Thus, the 2-day ruling. It is an incredibly important piece of news that everybody is trying to hide from the people and attention. What is happening here is historic. As the price of GME goes up, the magnitude of the problem gets massive as the amount of money that cannot be accounted for gets huge.

I think this is just the tip of the iceberg. $1000 is not a meme, $2000 is around the corner, $5000 is no joke at all. Hold. You are witnessing one of the greatest stories of capitalism. This is getting serious.'",hudsonsaul,69,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m16emz/gme_megathread_for_march_09_2021/gqd6kib/,0.093,0.742,0.165,0.9882

First of all, thank you for all of your kind words. It really means a lot that people have been enjoying my commentary. The more information we have, the better decisions we can make. 

[Here is the link to yesterday's thoughts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0fpgd/gme_megathread_for_march_08_2021/gq7ho82/) I will update this comment with what I see from GME throughout the day. As I am at work, I can only update whenever I have free time. If anyone has ideas on how I can provide content like this for a living, please let me know. I'd love to do this for other major stocks Reddit is watching.

**ELI5 - Why is Gamestop up while markets are down?**

People with a lot of money own a lot of shares of various stock. In order to make some more money, they loan those shares out to others for interest much like a bank would loan money out for interest. These people who borrow these shares then sell the shares and reinvest them into other companies. Those people believe that the money they make from the other companies is greater than the amount of money they pay in interest for the loan that they took.

Many shares of Gamestop were borrowed. People used that money to invest in other companies. Demand for Gamestop went up, so the price went up. Those who are borrowing from Gamestop believe that the price will go back down. They either do not pay back their loans, or they take out new loans to extend their borrow time. During this time, they are paying interest. Gamestop price is still going up. At one point, those who lent out the shares will ask for their shares back. The borrowers must buy shares of Gamestop to return to the lenders. Because of how high the price is, the borrowers must now liquidate their stock in order to pay back the loans. The market going down is a sign that these people are liquidating their position so that they can repay their loans. The higher Gamestop goes, the more they have to liquidate. As stocks get liquidated, the overall value of the market goes down.

Lending is a healthy aspect of the economy. It is what helps provide liquidity, innovation, and growth. To borrow money, there is a process with check and balances to make sure that those that are borrowing money are able to pay it back. However, those rules don't exist when you borrow a share, which you then turn into money. There are a lot of people who are borrowing shares who should not be allowed to borrow shares. This is why we have the issues that we do.

The mass media will blame Gamestop and retail investors for the market correction. It was the borrowers who refused to cut their losses and continue borrowing stocks who caused this crash to happen. It is those who lent out shares to those unable to repay their debts who caused this crash to happen. The retail investor simply sees a valuable product and makes what they believe is a good investment.

**Pre-Market Update**

GME ended at 194.50 yesterday. Pre-market, GME has been hovering around 215. There were 400,000 shares left to borrow as of closing bell yesterday. We will find out at 9 whether those numbers have changed. 

Current Price: 217.43

**9:05 Pre-Market Update**

Shorts available have gone down from 400,000 to 250,000. Don't be afraid if GME starts off with a short attack. The Pre-Market price has pushed up to 225.  We might see another crazy day today.

Shorts available: 250,000

Current price: 226.34 *corrected

**10:07 Update**

Alright everyone, we started with what seemed like an attack on GME starting at 225 dropping down to below 210. What followed was a rally up to around 235 before stabalizing around 230. Current shorts available are at 500,000 so what we most likely saw was 150,000 shorts from Pre-Market being opened at opening bell followed by 250,000 shorts being closed. This may be two moved from two different groups which might show that the group bear mentality might be fracturing and some might be cutting their loses. As long as someone continues to open shorts, I don't see the current price trend reversing. Shorts must close at a level to where the apes are satisfied. General Reddit sentiment tells me we're nowhere close to that level.  🚀🚀🚀

Shorts available: 500,000

Current price: 226.74

**10:48 Update**

50,000 shorts were opened at around 10, but I didn't see it make much of an impact. Maybe the reason why it dippes below 240? The apes are hungry and are continuing to push the price up. 🦍 🍌 🚀 🌝

Shorts available: 450,000

Current price 235.82

**11:34 Update**

Forgive me for slow updates. It's been a busy day at work. Shortly after my last update, we saw a drop in price that took GME close to 225. Over the course of the next 45 minutes, the price went back up to 235. After that, we saw available shorts climb by 300,000 to 750,000. The bears were able to regain some ground on shorts available, however the price has steadily been climbing again pushing towards 240. 50,000 shorts were opened, but it seems to have had a negligible impact. They may not have deployed them into the market yet. We might see a stronger short shot to try and sedate the apes' bloodlust.

Shorts available: 700,000

Current price: 237.17

**12:47 Update**

The stock has been pretty volatile between 245 and 235. During this volatility, we saw 250,000 shorts closing followed by 50,000 opening back up. This is a net gain of 200,000 shorts available while maintaining the price of GME around 240. It seems that GME has reached a point where shorts can slowly close without a major increase in price. I don't have volume data, so I can't guess if this is due to apes leaving their position or simply a lack of more demand. I also don't have information as to how many total shorts are still outstanding, so I can't guess how much ground is actually being made up by the bears. 900,000 available compared to total shorts will tell us how much upward pressure is still left in GME. It's easier to guess when the available shorts are near zero as that's an obvious marker for short demand. Forgive me if I'm more careful with price movement speculation as more shorts become available. 

Regardless, 240 seems to be an equilibrium at the moment. Once something changes, expect the equilibrium point to adjust as well.

Shorts available: 900,000

Current price: 239.23

**1:37 Update**

But much has happened. GME has held around 240. Shorts availability is still at 900,000.

Shorts available: 900,000

Current price: 239.12


**2:23 Update**

Apparently my comment went down? I still see it. Please let me know if anyone else sees it.

Not much has changed. Price has been hovering around 236. Shorts have remained steady.

Shorts available: 900,000

Current price: 235.32

**2:56 Update**

I have no idea what happened to my original post. I've contacted the mods. I'm sure it was a glitch in the system.

We've had volatility between 230 and 240, but it seems to be natural. There hasn't been a shift in shorts available. We'll see if power hour will take GME out of this stalemate.

Shorts available: 900,000

Current price: 235.68

**3:40 Update**

Still have no idea what happened to my original comment. 

GME has broken 240 and seems to be making a push up towards closing bell. GME shorts have remained steady, though some have commented that they might be shorting from other places. I don't have that info on me and need to do research to figure out how much affect they've had. That might be a way for some to mask their shorting intent, but seeing how we've only just now budged out of the 230-240 range, I'm not too worried at the moment.

Enjoy the rest of power hour!

459,GME," Wow, someone that actually understands the shit show and willing to explain it to others. This is my biggest issue with people idolizing DFV and claiming diamond hands...

DFV cashed out millions in stock based on retail traders FOMO. Some of you that bought at $300+ probably bought some of the stock he sold.  Yes he rebought on a dip and is making even more money. However, diamond hands - that's just a way to get idiots to commit to been the bag holder at the end. Smart money pulls out profits to cover their investment and ensure no loses. Most people on here are going to be left after the crash. Only gamble what your willing to lose on GME. 

Its mostly going to be the people that can't afford it that are left holding. If your buying 3-4 stocks at $400+ that tells me a few things. First, you don't understand the stock market and are just hoping to follow others - risky. Second - if you can only afford a few stocks then you don't understand risk management. Your talking a huge risk on a meme stock that had no reason to be valued his high - your betting that the market can be manipulated high enough to break HF. That just won't happen - HF are playing both sides. If you can only buy 3-4 shares then you don't have much money to lose and should have probably put that money somewhere else.",ark_mod,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m15akr/get_ready_boys_were_coming_back_fo_yall_no_retard/gqd6uq3/,0.07,0.778,0.152,0.9644

Now let's assume your total contribution room is 60k, and that you've maxed it out. Now let's say you've doubled your investment, now with a TFSA worth 120k. You decide to withdraw it all out in 2021, bought yourself a used Lambo.

Considering that transferring a winning position into a TFSA could easily be looked at as an attempt to avoid taxes. Realistically, the money you've deposited into a TFSA can be invested and grown tax-free.

The more I think about it, the more I believe that it would be going against the TFSA principles and therefore wouldn't be a possible move, not just on Ibkr. I'd research it more thoroughly and ask someone with more knowledfe for a definite answer.",boih_stk,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0walz/since_round_two_started_ive_had_a_limit_in_at_200/gqavr4g/,0.019,0.83,0.151,0.9356

524,GME," Investing in GME reduces the supply of available GME shares. This drives the price up.

If GME' price rises, the company' market cap rises. Lots of banks will give loans based on a company's valuation, and it's easier to get beter rate loans if your company is worth more. It's also easier to make deals and partnerships when you can say you run a $15B company vs. a $3B.  Nothing doesn't get better when your share price goes up, except maybe certain taxes.

In the current low-interest-rate environment, investing in GME and driving the share price up means the company can pay off and take on new debt at better rates, and begin to expand and reinvest in itself.

552,GME," ah okay gotcha, I'd like to get into the GME style trading.

Like how much were the shares when people initially started buying them?

I wouldn't mind hopping on a bandwagon like this if it ever happens again lmao, I can afford to lose £50-£150 so its worth the risk.

And maybe investing ""spare change"" in smaller businesses and stuff, seeing what happens, I'm not a big spender and I have regular savings currently getting me next to nothing in interest rates, I wouldnt mind using the spare money I have lying around for investing rather than putting even more into my savings each month.

616,DD," tldr: I think 3/19 expiration date will benefit the momentum in $GME and keep Nasdaq surpressed because it 's sell off is funding momentum in $GME and other overly hedged stocks (the sell off has been mentioned mainly because of yield rates, but DOW and S&P hold firmly.)

To all of you who posted so many DD on short squeeze, gamma squeeze, fundamentals and even some TA: thank you

Restricted my ideas to 3/19/21 for this question.

Yesterday, as $GME stock hit $200, this could be triggered by market makers (MM) to hedge against the option chain towards that number expiting this week and next week.

This would be forced by gamma/delta changing, hence a gamma squeeze and to me this looks to have started after $40-$45 weeks when stockprice steadily went up, with even on alow volume day a higher closing every day.

Question:

Am I right to think, that because of the option chain between $200 and $250 and $250 and $300 doesn't have a lot of open interest till 3/19 a gamma squeeze as such would not be as intense as the last few weeks? (please see also short squeeze later on which may induce further gamma squeeze adding to momentum again)

Yesterday, some more stock was shorted. We can discuss whether intrest rate for that is high or low, I think intrest rate not that important as a cost factor for the decision a HF takes at this moment as it is marginal cost to them (ofcourse total intrest payment is adding up for them)

I think the amount that was shorted yesterday was not that much. I read about 400K. So as it was shorted, and price and volume still went up, there also might have been HF covering previous positions and HF going long as well. But this is not a short squeeze at the moment.

Question: am I correct?

Nasdaq decline, mainly contributed to rising yield on bonds (return on invested nominal value of a bond)

I don't buy into this. Dow and S&P still at high -close to AH for Dow- levels. If bond rates are that important to traditional investors, they'd have pulled out of stock in general.

Media too tell us 'we're shifting from growth stock to traditional stock as flying and travel will increase, bla bla bla etc. etc.'

I don't buy this either. It may have contributed for some investors, but not all of them. Why? because investments in Nasdaq are mainly done by investors that purposefully invest in it. They don't suddenly start to invest in traditionals.

MMs collected premiums for selling futs , which plunged OTM after Nasdaq drop

HFs that might have shorted Nasdaq have had a nice payday too.

This kind of money adds up. And that's nice, as they will need it to hand over to you and me , as there is some outstanding debt in $GME positions: short positions and the options sold by MM

Now, the option chain till $250 is mostly empty, but Hfs might start to close positions thus a sort of slow short squeeze until also MM step in and start buying stock as gamma changes.

This would have the two squeezes combined, adding yet again momentum, and the rest will be history after the dust settles when both MM and HF scramble to find shares to cover.

Final question: am I a goofy quanon like for thinking that Nasdaq money has been freed to relieve pressure on MMs at the futures side of the market and profiting Hfs.",iamjustinterestedinu,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0r4gd/technicals_show_gme_is_going_much_higher_analysis/gqazzxm/,0.042,0.868,0.091,0.9869
617,DOW," tldr: I think 3/19 expiration date will benefit the momentum in $GME and keep Nasdaq surpressed because it 's sell off is funding momentum in $GME and other overly hedged stocks (the sell off has been mentioned mainly because of yield rates, but DOW and S&P hold firmly.)

To all of you who posted so many DD on short squeeze, gamma squeeze, fundamentals and even some TA: thank you

Restricted my ideas to 3/19/21 for this question.

Yesterday, as $GME stock hit $200, this could be triggered by market makers (MM) to hedge against the option chain towards that number expiting this week and next week.

This would be forced by gamma/delta changing, hence a gamma squeeze and to me this looks to have started after $40-$45 weeks when stockprice steadily went up, with even on alow volume day a higher closing every day.

Question:

Am I right to think, that because of the option chain between $200 and $250 and $250 and $300 doesn't have a lot of open interest till 3/19 a gamma squeeze as such would not be as intense as the last few weeks?

636,GME," its a simple risk analysis - either you tank your company by posting huge losses and thats a guarantee - or you have an 'out' by holding on to them and bleed out the borrow rates until hopefully people give up and go home and the stock returns to normal levels. The question is, can we stay retarded longer than they can stay solvent. They are depending on people rebalancing away from GME over the next few months. There is no squeeze if they don't close their positions - but also there are fees they are paying for borrowing the stock to short it - so if we simply reach a stalemate where the stock stays at 200 for a long enough period of time - the hedge fund will post losses indefinitely on the position.

Now, retail investors aren't just going to sit with most of their net worth in something that ISN'T GOING UP - so their bet is that we break first and start selling. Maybe johnny wants a down payment on a house, or becky wants to clear her student debts - well go right ahead says the hedge funds - sell that GME.... PLEASE.

But maybe, just maybe... they are wrong. People will continue to hold and buy more and more.... If that happens - it is lights out hedge fund. It won't happen suddenly. It will be slowly bleeding them to death over time until they have had enough and they close out their position. Only at that point - they CAN""T close the position. Except they are too big to fail and SOMEONE has to pick up the pieces. It is dividing by zero and will completely break our financial system if that happens. If you have a hedgefund bankrupted with borrowed shares, and they MUST return those shares - someone has to pick up the pieces and close the short position. If people refuse to close the positions at any price - well then there will be a toppling of financial institutions like the world has never seen. The government may have to step in and force people to close their positions in the stock at a certain price (say $10,000 a share).",heapsp,18,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0r4gd/technicals_show_gme_is_going_much_higher_analysis/gqawt0p/,0.072,0.843,0.084,0.2022

***INTERPRETING DAILY FINRA SHORT SALE REPORTS***

Mods please don’t delete :)
I’ve seen a lot of posts about FINRA daily short sale reports and what it means. Importantly it doesn’t mean what you think. This isn’t FUD it’s just how market making works.

TL;DR a lot of the short volume is market makers shorting to facilitate *buy* orders and they immediately cover with the next trade. 

-High short volume in the FINRA report actually often reflects net BUYING. This is why trying to interpret these reports is pretty much useless. 

-That sounds crazy but that’s how market making works. 
-FINRA report is only for off exchange trades (dark pools). It’s a myth that dark pools are all institutional, your retail broker is sending trades to dark pools like Citadel, Virtu, etc. 

-A MM makes money on the spread between buying and selling (obviously). 
What happens is - your order to buy 100 shares of GME at market gets sent to a dark pool. The MM (a computer) SHORTS you those shares at $108.793 and then BUYS those shares back at $108.791. A short of 100 shares is recorded. This also explains how you see ridiculous volumes and ridiculous # of shorts every day for a stock that has a 50M float. The MM isn’t “going short” GME. They short it for a millisecond then buy a fraction of a penny lower a millisecond later.

-So high short volume in the FINRA report (which is ONLY reflecting off exchange trades (dark pools) does NOT necessarily reflect high levels of actual shorting. It often reflects high levels of buying! Um. Like we just saw this week. Repeat that It does also does NOT reflect exchange trades. 

You don’t have to believe me you can read this super interesting piece here. Generally speaking, the idea that large short volume in the report is good news for holders seems true! It’s just not for the reasons you think. 

Edit: I should add it’s also just tons of algos/ HFT/ option hedging, etc.

688,GME," I already replied to this in your post in the other sub but for visibility sake:

While I'd love to agree with this as it would confirm my bias that gme is going to Pluto, using short volume is not a good indicator for calculating SI. The main reason being is that MM are constantly adding liquidity so that trading does not pause buy selling shares they don't own and then milliseconds later buying them to keep liquidity flowing.

What does this mean? It means that they facilitate transactions by selling shares that they don't necessarily have that second so that trading doesn't go kaput. But Essentially they are buying the stock the next second later. It looks like a short buts actually a slight bid ask spread for MM to make sure there's liquidity in the market. 

That being said I would take your methodology and apply it it several other tickers to see if GME is an outlier. If you can show other tickers have vastly different short volumes then perhaps your methodology is correct. 

Otherwise what you are calculating is basically MMs adding liquidity by borrowing shares to sell to bidders and then buying them from askers within a fraction of a second. Technically this is not shorting but it does show up as short volume.

Hedge funds “need to cover” for 2 reasons:
1) their borrow gets recalled or becomes just too expensive. This is actually super super super rare. Look at RkT. High SI, 50% borrow cost, special dividend, HFs don’t GAF. That spike was hype/ gamma probably very few covered. 

2) they lose too much money and they get equivalent of margin called. Typically this involves losing money on both sides of the book like what happened in January. 

Managing short positions is very difficult for one big reason- as your trade goes against you it gets bigger. 

Ex: 
Go long XYZ 5% of your portfolio. You’re wrong, it doesn’t work out, Stock down 40% the trade shrinks itself to 3% 

Go short ABC -5% of your portfolios. You’re wrong, stock goes up 40%, uh oh it’s now a -7% position.  They literally have to keep buying just to keep the position the same size. 

Anyway, if your shorts make a huge move  against you and your longs also are down it’s a disaster. Your capital has declined while your shorts are ballooning. Literally have to keep buying and buying and buying.
GME would not have played out the way it did in January if a bunch of other short names weren’t also up and a bunch of popular HF longs weren’t also down.

That might have been true prior to 31 JAN. Billions and Billions of losses, however, would not be ignored. Not for long. Those are real losses that one would need a powerful level of self-delusion to set aside.

True but it is highly, highly unlikely they will cause your death either. You've not suffered losses to them. The same is not true for the HF managers.

>England kept marching in lines against american rebels that adopted the native american battle tactics.

An oversimplification on a few fronts.

* Colonial forces continued to engage in stand-up fights. The hit-and-fade fighting was just one part of the conflict and a valuable one that kept a lot of deployed British forces occupied. But it did not fix and force surrender either.
* British forces had fought irregular forces many times. Recall that Washington himself fought in the French and Indian War just a decade prior. They knew to fix and destroy the logistical and basing locations of opponents which engage in hit-and-run tactics as well as seize routes of supply and strong points. To supply guns and men, one needs depots and logistics.
* The British were professionals and the Colonial forces had plenty of weak points, logistically speaking, they could strike at. The issue is that the British were not facing a purely unpracticed opponent. They were facing an army lead and trained by experienced professionals. More over, the Colonial forces were not the only combatant in the room. The British could ill-afford to go all in while the French sat just across the channel and a whole, globe-spanning empire required defending.
* The war did not just wage on land. The better example of such tactics put to good use is seen with the privateers at sea, where neutral ports can be relied upon for supply (or any of the thousands of backwater estuaries) and the British forces relied on a very exposed supply chain that crossed thousands of miles of ocean. There is a reason the island nation focused on its naval power for centuries.",JustAnotherQubesUser,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m19sa7/true_short_interest_in_gee_em_ee_could_be/gqd25bs/,0.153,0.741,0.106,-0.9726

775,DD," From DD I’ve read, it *could* realistically hit $100k, but the problem will be if anyone steps in. If all the stock holders sell at $100k, it could cause some serious repercussions on the entire market - there is a good chance the SEC could step in to prevent that.

Your best bet is watch it closely or put a stop-loss order in if your broker allows that. With it looking like it’s going to close around $250, I’d consider a stop-loss at $180. That way if it starts to tank, you don’t lose everything.

As it continues to go up, adjust your stop-loss accordingly. But realize that the higher is goes, the bigger the dips can be without it collapsing.

Edit: Take this advice at your own risks. Any losses or even any gains are nobodies responsibility but your own. Only invest with money you are will to lose.

Solid information from this guy, with no ticker or company name mentioned. Google search reveals nothing relevant.

At this point anyone who tries to gather factual information, or doesn't say ""GME to $69,420,"" is a shill, apparently. It's a very cult-y and conspiracy-driven way of thinking.

I'm paper-handed on GME for sure, but only because I can't discern reality from hype. Sounds like 90% of the commenters in this thread can't, either. I still haven't heard a single fact to support the idea that GME can reach six figures. It sounds absolutely incredulous to me. Four figures? Okay, I believe it's possible. Five?

825,GS," Yeah, I know literally all of that. I've been on that tricare and housing. I didn't say you can't get wealthy in the military, but you don't get paid that well in general because you get all those benefits. Because they take care of all of that you can also invest all your money knowing you'll have your essentials alwaus covered. And even then, a lot of active duty wants to switch to a GS position, civilian contractor, or military reserve while working a GS position because they get paid better than civilians and still get to keep all the benefits. Active duty and enlisted don't make that much, especially compared to contractors and GS personnel. Those are the ones who are rich in/around the military. Not to mention if you get a contract postion overseas, you don't even pay income tax. The wages themselves aren't that great, but the benefits that you can take advantage of can make you wealthy.

Buy low, sell high.  Don’t be a bag holder.  You are not a part of a group, none of these people will help with your retirement.  Buy what you can lose, have a goal and fucking SELL when that goal is met.

I ate shit in January listening to these retards.  Could’ve quintupled my investment and walked away, but my rookie ass started actually believing all this bullshit.

The enthusiasm here causes enthusiasm from much larger fish in the market, to be sure.  All this talk and faux solidarity brings sharks into the water who are always looking for bagholders.  Well looky here, a subreddit full of potential marks.

Maybe I am wrong, admittedly, I’m a fucking idiot who doesn’t understand options all that well.  Maybe it does go to the moon, or Mars or Andromeda.  I fucking doubt it, I would bet against that ever happening.

But when I bought 33 shares @ $46 and didn’t sell when it hit $400, I was and am a total jackass.  I sold only my initial layout.  I should have sold the whole shebang and bought back in when it inevitably hit ~$40 again.

Buy what you can afford.
Set a goal.
SELL when goal is met.

929,GME," nah, he's been looking into short positions on GME going back to last year. iirc, he made his initial purchase of the 50k shares and said that his analysis of the data had him believe that there would be a short squeeze that would likely take place April of this year. that's when everyone here initially called him a fucking dumbass.

on top of that, he's often mentioned GameStop's good earnings reports, the then upcoming release of the new console generation, and their unique position as *the* video game store to take advantage of a market they were underperforming as fundamentals for the company to make a turnaround.

things heated up for GME when Ryan Cohen got involved late last year, and, early January, they started adding more tech-savvy executive positions to support a pivot to e-commerce. that's when shit jumped from like ~$20 to ~$40 over a three day period. a lot of subscribers happened to catch his YOLO update threads around there, where the stupid amounts of gains were quite apparent - that's about when the stock went meme status.

everybody rushing to buy a ticket for the obvious upcoming rocket ship certainly increased his overall gains, but, that was never his plan. if none of us ever got involved, I'm pretty sure he'd still be sitting calmly, updating a board full of haters on his long-term play making him consistent money, all because he likes the stock.

as for his initial claim, there still *might* be that short squeeze that gets resolved in April. however, all the fucking craziness that has ensued in the last few months could've moved it up, or pushed it back, or changed the game completely, who knows? I don't, I just eat crayons, and periwinkle is my favorite flavor. 

DFV might be able to figure that shit out, but, he's gone pretty brief and cryptic after the majority of the financial institutions in this country tried to throw him under the bus for their risky plays costing them billions of dollars in losses. probably a lucky thing that he can now afford ""fuck you"" lawyers at this point.",extralyfe,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m19v2q/gme_and_dfv_mentioned_on_fox_business/gqczmor/,0.08,0.789,0.131,0.9171

The entire US market is 30 trillion. 100k price point on GME would be 6 trillion dollars market cap, or 1/5 the market. So unlikely but not actually impossible, it will just require the entire market to contract similarly to the 08 crash.

1112,SI," This seems unlikely to me. Unless they play some fuckery at $500 or whenever of course.

By the time we get to $500 it would result in a lot more buying to hedge by market makers, and literally every short would be in the red by that price point since it would be a new all time high. These would put further upward pressure which would further fuel itself cyclically, like the gamma squeeze two weeks ago.

Also I'm pretty sure there have been some shorts covering daily since this started going up, likely being replaced by newer shorts to some extent (lol to their folly). What the ratio is we can't know, but anybody who thinks all the shorts are hanging thight to their shorts all the way to wait until they get assfucked by a sudden squeeze is delusional. Especially those that shorted on the way down in Jan from $400 or $300, which are still largerly in the green, will run/have run for the exist with profits sooner rather than later.

We don't know what the real short figures are with all the fuckery that went on. The pre-Jan 140% SI itself may have been underrepresented, and now they're most definitely hiding as much as they can because the data being public is what got them fucked to begin with it. But this forces us vastly into guesswork territory.

It definitely doesn't feel like there has been much fighting to keep the price down for the entirety of last week, aside for little pushes to get it under some call option thresholds fast when it went above. Which my tinfoil hat finds concerning because if they're not even trying now, what fuckery could they be scheming next? Or the upwards pressure is too much they're not even trying now, between some shorts covering, MM heding, and longs FOMOing, all the while a lot of shares are held in diamond hands reducing availability.

I think earnings will give this a significant push one way or the other, depending on how they are, but they're still at least 2 weeks away and I honestly have no clue what's going to happen in between.

I totally expect the media to misrepresent the earnings to make them look worse then they are. If they're bad they'll paint them as the end of the world; if they're good they'll spend 2 lines at best about that and then nitpick on a slightly bad triviality for the remainder of their articles; if they're good with nothing whatsoever that can be attacked expect $ROPE to skyrocket.

Thank you for reading my sermon. Now while a bot will probably suggest I run for senate, I'll go back to my corner crying for not YOLOing at $40 because I thought it wasn't the bottom yet and that a new upwards movement would have needed some catalyst to start (instead the Feb 24 gamma squeeze kinda came out of nowhere).",PestilentWarmth,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m13byb/gme_are_hfs_let_the_stock_price_go_up_in_the_500/gqcc5yr/,0.079,0.827,0.094,0.76

1115,GME," Devil's advocate here, but what if they simply shorted other tech stocks knowing all the apes are in GME right now. The gains following the 10% drop in the nasdaq is probably going to let them cover their GME position while still making a profit from the other shorts. Tbh I personally think tech valuations are somewhat too high right now, but betting with 10x leverage against retards with stimulus checks can really backfire and it can turn even worse if other institutions take notice and decide to follow the retards to trigger a squeeze...that is unless all the retards happen to be in one stonk that they like.

That's just my 2 cents, but if I managed a hedge fund I would stay the fuck away from meme stocks right now. If someone's willing to hold through -90% without folding that's not where you want to be trying to make money.

1117,AT," The constant buying and price support seen during each session to me indicates that institutional players see 1.

Now whales remove water, to decrease the level of the public reservoir to rigger the short-reservoir to to open its gates and flush it all into the long-reservoir where we can take it.

They push it as far up as necessary to make sure the people who shorted through shorts or options pay the bill. 

Those who bet short, try to prevent it. Those who bet long try to make it happen and the market-makers, exchanges and other insiders try to affect it as little as possible, to protect the illusion of a free market, while trying to control it enough to prevent the entire market from collapsing.

The question on where it will end is still open. It depends a lot on how many have to buy at the same time and what price we are at when the buys trigger. 

I doubt that they'd let them all default at the same time, so it will most likely be buffered over a prolonged period of time. This will reduce the maximum level GME will reach, but allow Retail to buy at elevated prices for far longer and also get a piece of the cake. 

Imho. 1k-10k is a realistic ballpark for the squeeze, but if we are lucky it could go even higher. We'll see when it happens.

For me, I want to sell max 10% of my position to cover my cost basis, as early as possible so I can let the rest run with house money. That means my potential profit ceiling comes down a bunch, but Im more likely to realise more of it because I won't pussy out when I get scared later on.

Once your cost basis is covered, even if the rest ends up being worth like $5 a share then that's still free money. And I think the fundamentals of GME justify a long term price target of like $400 anyway.

1152,GME," Go read the Investopedia on call options.

You can buy and sell options just like stocks. Their price becomes very volatile, especially as the expiration comes closer. So an option for a volatile security like GME is doubly volatile.

Can OP sell a contract now? Yes

Can OP exercise a contract now? Yes, but it doesn’t make sense to exercise until the market price is below the strike price (ITM).

How bad of an idea is it to buy calls? Depends on what happens with the stock price. GME calls are expensive and risky because of the volatility. If you’re not sure, it’s probably safer to stick with shares and play options with a paper account.

This isn’t investment advice. Do your own research.",ikefalcon,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0tbz8/alright_you_autists_i_have_70k_in_250_gme_calls/gqaky6d/,0.081,0.782,0.138,0.7093
1153,OR," So his current value is in the post.  The Value is about 71k.  He payed 20 x 30.42 x 100 so about 60.4k.  if it hits he gets (250-30.42)\*100, so about 220K OR he gets 2000 shares to sell when he wants.  This is how options work.  Please take with a grain of salt though, I've only just learned and I might be wrong.

&#x200B;

Sorry, one thing I missed is that he can sell his option at any time.  This is the premium.  If it were shares, you could think of it as unrealized gains.

1155,ASO," You would sell to close the position. Anytime before exercise if you are ITM at or above your break even price (strike price + cost of premium), you can just sell the contract which will still net you the same profit if you were to exercise and then close your position, also you need capital or margin in your account to cover the exercise price if you wish to exercise and acquire the shares.

Also, you can be OTM, by a large amount, and still make money selling the contract. For instance, I have 20c @30 ASO 3/19, which is currently trading at 27, with a breakeven price of 31.5, but if I were to sell to close, I'd be up about 2k. This is because when I purchased I was a smooth brain and the volatility was a lot lower. Now the premiums are basically double, so I can turn around and sell the same contract, make back the premium plus the additional premium now due to recent volatility.",xfirecane,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0tbz8/alright_you_autists_i_have_70k_in_250_gme_calls/gqba8t6/,0.017,0.95,0.033,0.1531

1362,GME," Looking at the media, they have decided to seem like they are long on GME and are using Cohen's appointment as the catalyst behind the rise. All that is done to hide, cover and hush hush the new SEC ruling about clearing. That is where the beast lays:

Everybody who is serious about the stock knows that there are more shares being traded daily than the actual shares, about 4 times as much, yes, that much. This is a huge problem, it is so big that no media outlet dares to touch that actual story. The 21-day rollover rule has created imaginary shares that have been 'failed to deliver' by shorts for months, maybe more. 

Options being written on shares that writers are told they own but in reality do not because they haven't been delivered by shorts to the clearing house is a fat big problem that threatens the whole financial system. This is much bigger than we think. What happens then is that brokers get caught in the middle. When the clearing house can not provide the actual stocks to brokers who have paid for them and told their customers they own the stock, we have serious fraud on the table.

There is going to be a responsible party for those imaginary shares. It will certainly not be retail holders, brokers will start buying the shorts into the stock to save themselves from being the responsible party. The SEC and the clearing house is no way going to be left holding the bag, that is too much responsibility and it would collapse the entire market.

Thus, the 2-day ruling. It is an incredibly important piece of news that everybody is trying to hide from the people and attention.  What is happening here is historic. As the price of GME goes up, the magnitude of the problem gets massive as the amount of money that cannot be accounted for gets huge.

I think this is just the tip of the iceberg. $1000 is not a meme, $2000 is around the corner, $5000 is no joke at all. Hold. You are witnessing one of the greatest stories of capitalism.

1453,AMC," I did the same thing with AMC. Averaged my cost down from $10 to $7. But, ""I'll sell if it starts going lower"" is a ton easier said than done. You are getting high premiums from volatility. If GME drops back to $200 on Friday you have to decide where you put your next strike. If you stay at $300 and the stock falls to $100 you are bag holding with no way out for the week. If you choose $200 for the high premium and it goes up you lost money. Then, what is your decision? You won't get much at $300c. But, you go lower and it could get assigned and you still lose money on the stock and have cap gains on the option premium.

Think of it like this - if executing an option contract early, purchased those shares at the strike price, for this example let’s say you have a option at $25 GME strike Price. You could buy that deep in the money call at the market tomorrow - then execute the contract immediately and then own those 100 shares at $25..... which would be an instant profit of over $30,000+ ..... options must honor the time (theta) obligation before execution or else everyone would just buy deep in the money calls, execute them and get wildly rich immediately.

Edit: math was off. GME close $193.50 which is what the option chain will have frozen at. $193.50 - $172.55 (listed price of option) - $20 strike = $0.95, which means the listed price is lower than intrinsic.

The implied Volatility of your calls is about 500% right now. It was 900% at the peak of the last squeeze. These numbers are assuming the volatility stays high. If it starts dropping, then your calls will take a BEATING. For reference, the S&P has an implied volatility of 20%... 500% is huge. For each percentage point the IV loses, your position loses \~4$ (conversely, it should gain 4% on the upside).

If nothing changes, by tomorrow afternoon your position already is down 18%. Time is a bitch.  It's a race against the clock to 500.

That being said, might as well hold them for a bit, because if there is a big enough move by Wednesday you might still be in the clear! Just use this when weighing taking profits.

All I know is putting $10 on amc and watching it drop to like $5 is fine to me rather than buying gamestop at $237 right now and dropping back to $150. I'm not one of those that buys multiple lottery tickets. I buy just one and watch to see what happens. What's my position, you wonder? $12 call in AMC expires in january.

Because you keep looking at dumb shit. Yes, there is money to be made in the squeeze, but *there has to be a buyer for you to sell*. At a certain price point buying becomes unviable. The shorters will die long before we get to five figures territory.

1770,GS," I think the actual limit in share price will be institutional shareholders selling at 1k+ numbers, or lower, unless they're actively trying to play the squeeze, rather than letting their algos to the trading. The problem is large shareholders can't dump large positions quickly without cratering the price. So they'll be trying to slowly exit without causing a crash, whether trading by algo or managing actively. Similarly, shorts can't cover super fast without mooning the price, at some point, the mark-to-market difference in the short positions will require so much capital as collateral with their clearing houses that they'll be liquidating large holdings in other securities and that will cause a severe downturn/crash in the overall market, and that's when the powers that be will shut everything down. They might have to literally close global markets for days to unwind the mess at some fixed price. There will be lawsuits, liquidity will be scarce, your money might be tied up by emergency orders from judges for a while. That's IF we get there, but I see that as happening by around 10k/share, ESPECIALLY if people are right that naked shorting has lead to 100s of percent more shares sold short than there are in existence bc of the lack of a hard locate and hold on actual shares when short positions are opened. See the total liability won't be the market cap if there's more short obligations than there are shares outstanding. The total liability will be share price x short positions. So if shorts have actually sold 500% of the float that's still like 400% of shares outstanding, meaning a 10k/share pricepoint yields about a 700B x 4 liability of 2,800B or 2.8 trillion with a T. Once you start pushing 1T liability, you're well into the ""market crash, global depression, millions and millions of lives lost, worst possible scenario given current unemployment and financial distress as we're struggling to get through the pandemic"" ... you see where that logic is going. The Gov will absolutely fuck everyone, undo millions of transactions, when the same ""smart people"" at GS who explained why they needed to bail out the banks in '09 explain that this is ""so much worse"" ... maybe they just print a bunch of money and hope it doesn't collapse the dollar. Certainly seems to have worked during the pandemic (money printing), but all that money printing was done for ""rational"" reasons, and this ""market craziness"" will be spun as ""gangs of thugs spending their government checks on market manipulation."" Just look at the media, we're not the ""good guys"" and the Joe Bidens of the world are not going to understand that it's insufficient regulation of short selling that got us here in the first place. Too much money is made on HFT for hard locating to ever be enforced, so this synthetic shorting and failure to deliver problem will continue.",ilosemoneyz,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1dlfh/what_will_happen_to_the_global_economy_if_gme/gqdkqe5/,0.134,0.757,0.109,-0.9229

1870,BB, The AtHoc system is a mass announcement system its designated purpose is too have someone post a large notification on emergency events and lightning within 5. Also the government is not a big fan of cloud technology past a WAN enterprise. How AtHoc is supposed to improve past the point its already is at doesn't make too much sense its a large text message essentially. As someone who has built AtHoc servers and used them before unless this requires a new license agreement with the government I dont see this being all that impactful for the BB stock as a bagholder myself in BB I feel the car brand partnerships are far more impactful for the future of BB. Big wrinkle moment here if BB could come out with a ACAS tool or a FW tool that the government bought that would greatly impact their stock but I see that as unlikely for the near future.,xDiedrich,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m16tk7/blackberry_athoc_authorized_for_use_in_government/gqd048b/,0.022,0.95,0.027,0.1948
1871,GME," I will say the comparisons to Blockbuster make sense, but only if you think of an alternate reality where Blockbuster pivoted and went online and bought Netflix. GME is doing all the right things it needs for it to go digital.

What kept me holding when GME went back down to 40 and I was caught holding 14 shares @ 95 was the constant faith in the stock on WSB, RoaringKitty's testimony and Uncle Bruce and his bagels.

You're right about reading giving you this information, but it sticks better and is easy to remember on practice.

1880,GME," Yesterday, I went back into GME simply because of all the talks about the SEC and DTCC. Some guy then posted something I read, it made sense to me so I made a good decision.  


Then I lost most of my profits from failing to understand the points I've mentioned myself yesterday. But I got most of my experience yesterday and I will never forget. Luckily, I sold (on my old provider) just before I made a loss.

1882,GME," That's almost true. I put in 300 EUR in Stocks. I went to a -160 EUR loss and gave up for a few months. When I went back into GME, I went into the positives and went back down because of panic selling. Quickly after I went black and then had my 40 EUR gains
