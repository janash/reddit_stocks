36,GM," Correct, but the thing is that McD’s corporate isn’t involved in the day to day of restaurants. They buy prime commercial land, develop it, then get a franchisee to run it. If the franchisee fails, they find another franchisee or sell the property. Prime commercial property rarely has prices decrease, and the market is usually strong thanks to competition.

They’re effectively a corporate real estate company that uses their burger licensing as a way to get reliable franchisees to pay the mortgages. Their management is on record that if selling something other than burgers from prime commercial real estate made for more reliable franchisee revenue to pay the mortgage payments.

Even when franchisees do fail, they can usually sell the real estate in a couple months. Even if half the franchisees in the US failed due to bad franchisee policy leading to continued staff shortages and poor profits due to bad service, McDonald’s corporate would just have to find new franchisees or sell before their reserves get burnt through on mortgage payments. Not terribly hard, because becoming a franchisee is actually quite lucrative and they can often poach store managers from their own franchisees to go to operating a store of their own elsewhere for more pay.  Or they sell to another fast-food company who uses the same shell and just facelifts the building.

For the stock to collapse, the commercial real estate market would have to collapse to negate the land value or the fast food market would have to collapse negating their profit from development or the company would have to have an existential threat lawsuit, like a class-action about their beef not really being beef seeking compensation to all customers over the last several years (like the current Subway Tuna lawsuit, which could be an existential threat to Subway if it holds up in court).

They even run their food manufacture and distribution through some legal trickery to try to insulate some of the effects of things like that example lawsuit, as if they can allege it was the director of beef procurement and not corporate, the company would be less culpable for damages.

Subway, for example, isn’t in the real estate business, so franchisees shutting down doesn’t offer them the same recovery opportunities. If a Subway franchisee goes under, Subway can’t save the space and tell a store GM about the opportunity because the franchisee is paying the location owner directly. Once the franchisee shuts down, the venue is lost. (Incidentally why sometimes the Subway “moves” in town is because there is a franchisee switch and they find someone to bring Subway back to the town but the franchisee has to find a new location.)",Nutarama,66,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/onr3vc/next_big_short_observations_of_a_mcdonalds/h5uqaqj/,0.137,0.771,0.092,-0.9736

I don’t know about you but I see a legit need for a pullback. Every time SPY has seen a greater than 40% growth from year to year it has some type of pullback around 15%

2. Other pro-market parties will take advantage of this and either win the next election or win more seats and force the ANC to liberalize further. Not saying I agree with that outcome politically, but for the market it's def bullish.

523,UPS," >PepsiCo, one of Tesla’s biggest Tesla Semi reservation holders, has recently stated that they expect to take delivery of 15 Tesla Semi trucks for their Frito-Lay facility in Modesto, California.

I own no stocks so here is my fresh take.  Many companies that bought reservations did so as a testing route to see how well they will work out in certain sectors of their business.  Pepsi/Frio-Lay definitely have an incentive here in Commiformia with very high fuel prices doing deliveries on local routes.  Not only would that give them potential tax rebates, but save them enormously in fuel and mechanical costs - while being at the forefront of Tesla's service side.

It doesn't mean they have to fully convert, but gives them the opportunity to test it out and check out the balance sheet should things look good or if things don't look as good, wait a little longer.  Fifteen trucks for the whole of Pepsi is nothing and is really just a pilot program and is a no brainier to try things out and is going to get insane customer service from Tesla (if that is possible) as a potential high end client who could potentially be one of their biggest customers period (like Coke, Fed-Ex, UPS, etc).",-spartacus-,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/onzx54/tesla_semi_electric_truck_is_finally_about_to_go/h5vo3mx/,0.036,0.856,0.108,0.9337

530,IBM," this is a good and bad thing.

pltr wants to only deal with large companies. They piggy back off of the industry knowledge they have to help improve the software making the technology more proprietary and stickier for future clients and present.

for example ***Gotham*** was born from the need of government. **SkyWise** was born by working with airbus.

Working with small business will only be templates and will not create as much innovation and will not grow the TAM in the same way as working with Amazon web services or IBM has.

Palantir wants 3rd parties to deal with the small business. Palantir wants to only focus on the big picture.

They essentially learn and grow with every industry they work with. every contract becomes more and more important and benefits both Palantir and the industry.

Them focusing on small business that can not build hybrid software and applications that benefit both is an entirely different business model. 

Some would argue that this means that just working with fortune 500 companies is not working or at least not as well as it should be.",cupnhandle,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oo1k1u/palantir_introduces_foundry_for_buildersfoundry/h5wu021/,0.047,0.837,0.116,0.9215

I thought not. It's not a story mutual fund managers would tell you. It's a Yolo legend. Hwang was a short bus extraordinaire of the billionaire class, so powerful and so rich he could use the Leverage to influence the market to create parabolic run ups... He had such a knowledge of the market that he could even keep the tickers he cared about from dying. The leverage of Hwang is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing VIAC, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his hedge fund everything he knew, then his hedge fund margin called him in his sleep. Ironic, he could save multiple tickers from bottoming out their capital, but not himself.",walter1021,17,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oo9tqk/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_july_21_2021/h5x2dn0/,0.05,0.847,0.103,0.7144

*""A very large move in the SPX today, which ripped straight up to the ZeroGamma level of 4334 and stalled out. This +1.7% move tied directly in to the large move that was forecasted in the AM note. The major key to this rally was the crushing of implied volatility as denoted by the VIX losing 2.7pts to 19.73.""*

*""Interestingly the SPX options volume was on the lighter side at 1.1mm contracts, with our intraday options data seeing mainly negative delta flow. This is a curious divergence, similar to what we saw yesterday.""*

*""This move places the market back in the neutral zone, with 4300 the critical “risk on” level. The VIX expiration is tomorrow morning which could explain some of the divergent reading we saw today in options land, and may have been a catalyst for some of this volatility.""*

Think of it another way, most people who become millionaires do it by shoving as much as they feel comfortable into an S&P500 broad based ETF every month (like VTSAX) over the course of decades and, POOF, one day they're a millionaire (or multi-millionaire) and ready to retire. We pick individual stocks because we want to expedite the process. CRSR should be worth about double where it's currently at and that's if it doesn't really grow anymore than it currently has. Let's say the market is totally irrational and it takes 2 years for CRSR stock to grow that 100%. That's still 50% per year which is vastly beating the 8-10% most other people make in their boring ETFs. I think my estimate of 100% over 2 years is actually pretty conservative.

774,XM," Interesting Further even posted today on nasdaq.com: (expert analysis)

Though it may get overshadowed by many of the other faster-growing Nasdaq 100 companies, satellite-radio operator Sirius XM (NASDAQ: SIRI) is the perfect blend of modest growth and value to add to your portfolio in July.

Let's begin with the obvious: Sirius XM is a legal monopoly. Though it's not devoid of competition, there aren't any other satellite-radio operators. This affords Sirius XM a handful of clear-cut competitive advantages that should allow the company to steadily grow its top and bottom line.

As an example, Sirius XM's revenue pie differs pretty dramatically from what you'll see via terrestrial radio operators and streaming radio services. The latter are almost exclusively reliant on advertising revenue, which isn't a bad thing when the U.S. economy is expanding. The problem is that recessions and contractions are an inevitable part of the economic cycle. When recessions do arise, ad revenue dries up quickly, threatening the terrestrial and streaming operating model.

Comparatively, Sirius XM generates the bulk of its revenue from recurring subscriptions to its satellite-radio service. During the first quarter, just over 78% of its $2.06 billion in revenue derived from subscriptions. That's important, because subscribers are far less likely to cancel during an economic downturn. In fact, Sirius XM saw its subscriber revenue jump during the pandemic-impacted 2020.


Another key advantage for SiriusXM is its satellite network. A number of expenses, such as transmission and cost of equipment, are relatively fixed from one year to the next. Put in a different context, no matter how many new subscribers SiriusXM adds, the costs to transmit service to these folks won't increase. That's a formula for margin expansion over the long run.

As the icing on the cake, the auto industry's transition to electric vehicles could create a multi-decade vehicle replacement cycle that allow Sirius XM to pick up millions of new subscribers annually.",Novadreams22,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/onu4gc/why_im_bullish_on_siri_again_read_this_news/h5u5nrz/,0.036,0.851,0.113,0.96

So the thing invented in 1893 can now be achieved with Sirius/XM. Neat. Oh but they have an app you say?! Pretty sure there are plenty of music and talk radio streaming options available. Lame.
