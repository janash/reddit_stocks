But years later in a stunning twist of events the shares of AGTC blow up, making the younger one very wealthy. This leads to an explosion of jealousy from the older one, who of course by this time has recklessly spent the cash on a variety of vices and bad investments. The younger one though has little sympathy because they remember when the older one cheated them. This inevitably leads to an irreparable division with the family and the two sides never speak to each other again.

170,TRCH, I could be wrong but I thought I read you will get a 1:1 with TRCH and a 3:1 with MMATF. MMATF is Canadian stock and not even available on NASDAQ. The new ticker will be META? And if you get in prior to the merger you will get a dividend at the EOY. Donâ€™t know exactly what it will pay but heard itâ€™s anywhere between $1-$25 per share. Huge range but it helps secure part of your investment. Maybe we will know more when TRCH sells its assets which have to be done by June I believe.,cookie2574,7,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m00ufp/whats_the_play_tomorrow/gq5wh29/,0.036,0.824,0.14,0.8922
171,TRCH, MMATF will own 75% of TRCH and owners of TRCH will get a 4 to 1 split when companies merge. If you are holding 200 shares of TRCH at merger you will then hold 50 shares of MMATF after merger. The plus for MMATF holders is they would now trade on the NASDAQ exchange. The plus for TRCH owners is they get paid out the special dividend from TRCH having to sell off all of there land assets/ assets in general. So TRCH will have to pay the special dividend per share.,zfagan103,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m00ufp/whats_the_play_tomorrow/gq69ba9/,0.014,0.844,0.141,0.8834
