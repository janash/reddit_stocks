0,IP," >Profit per unit of real gross value added has blown up since 2000, from 5% to 16% of every dollar of value added (which is output value minus input costs, if I'm reading this right).

Yep, as is the case with changes in technology (feel like something fundamentally changed right around Y2K..../r/hmmm). Tech companies are notoriously capex (and largely opex)-lite, so expanding margins makes total sense.

>Corporate profits as a fraction of GDP are at near record levels, about 10%. The historical norm might be 6%, but it shot up around 2007, fell sharply, then recovered and went higher.

See above. Greater profit per unit sold generally implies greater real dollar value profit for corporations across the board. Other things equal (in terms of government spending, net imports, etc), it makes mathematical sense that corporate profits would command a greater % of real GDP.

Especially if you're using 2007 as your baseline year to compare against.....

>Buybacks and dividends grew by a factor of about 2.5 from 2009 to 2019, and then shot up some more in 2020, with a lot of variation across industries.

Yep, the formerly high growth tech companies with novel ideas / products that are also cheap to produce, especially with an IP moat or first mover advantage are eventually going to slow down and mature. That generally means that it's time to reward those patient equity holders with some return on their capital in the form of divvy or share repo. Good example of this is when Apple initiated their divvy around 10ish years ago (I think)

Doesn't really have anything to do with low rates (why incur a greater cost of equity with increased buybacks and dividend hikes if baseline debt costs are basically 0%? And even cheaper when you think about tax deductibility of interest payments) or tax cuts (which have only been in effect for the last 4 - 5 years).",Jeff__Skilling,1,/r/investing/comments/11yczf4/are_corporate_profits_anomalously_high_and_will/jd91uu2/,0.03,0.773,0.197,0.9956

- the last few weeks of banking issues have been bad, but could have been a lot worse.  He said that there was real uncertainty that the CS/UBS deal wouldn't have reassured the market.
- They see the risk of substantial credit tightening.  I.e. their view on inflation has increased since Dec, but the need for further hiking is potentially offset by these tighter credit conditions.  If this doesn't happen then more hikes are needed.
- They see that inflation reduction is slowing in goods and continues increasing in services (exc housing)
- He was very clear on a few occasions that they do not foresee cuts this year

11,FRC," So I think people have become a bit too focused on the AFS and HTM style of securities that banks hold because they were specifically a big problem for SVB.  For the larger regional banks there are some losses in that space but the bigger issue if they had a bank run would be their loan books.  Really with FRC that's the big issue too, they're holding a ton of 15yr+ mortgages on their books with low rates that would take a big haircut if they need to be liquidated.

Other regional banks don't necessarily have it as bad and tend to have better maturity scales but there's still going to be a preference to shore up cash and super liquid assets with maturing loans both to offset any deposit losses and also assure the market that they could deal with further deposit draw downs.

16,OP," For an active pm trader which is how OP described themself, it shouldn't be an issue. It largely depends on the pm trading strategies being used. 

For example - I've only had to manage my mmf allocation once this year. 

Currently, I prefer to ladder box spreads for uninvested cash since I can get about 4.9% yield and bp utilization is less than 1% and fixed at $150/spread. And it's also common to use t-bills like u/nigelboid mentioned because it's only 1% of bp of the t-bill face-value.

Also - getting pm approval at Fidelity is also a bit tougher than getting pm at some other brokers than TDA. And the lack of margin management tools in Fidelity ATP for option traders is also a consideration for active traders. 

I'm not suggesting that Fidelity isn't a good broker. But if someone was already using TDA pm - it probably doesn't make sense to move to Fidelity.",greytoc,3,/r/investing/comments/11yok1z/what_do_folks_do_with_cash_in_their_trading/jd921fn/,0.022,0.92,0.058,0.5419

To me it certainly didn't seem worth it after thinking through all the consequences. One is it wouldn't even pay very much.

I think you need the simple answer first: It **can**, but it doesn't **have to**.  There's nothing written into the rules that says selling an overweight position ALWAYS generates a HUGE tax liability.

So, what to do:

* As others have said, simply change your allocation for new purchases.  It's like ""turning a battleship"", but you'll get there eventually.
* There's NO requirement to go ALL IN, ALL AT ONCE on rebalancing.  Take your single largest overweight holding, and sell PART of it -- spread the pain over time, especially if you're near a tax bracket boundary.
 * This also addresses the ""reversion to the mean"" problem, in that some sectore are cyclical, will be up one year, down the next.  Sell PART of an overweight position, then sit back, ""watch and wait"", see if your problem gets better by itself.

I think something that many people overlook, or miss in the first place, is that the difference in gross returns between some 40/30/20/10 allocation, and one that's shifted to 45/35/15/15 is (probably) statistically ""noise"" -- within the standard deviation of historical performance anyway.

31,CD," Probably ""online"" in this context means online only CD.  Banks (and Credit Unions) make money three main ways:

* profiting from duration risk (they can borrow short and lend long)
* profiting from credit risk (taking on risk of non-payment others are not willing to take when it is profitable)
* profiting from selling services.  

Rate chasing customers (""hot money"") don't buy many services.  They generally charge the banks something close to prevailing commercial interest rates for their deposits.  They are from the bank's perspective lousy customers.  But they can provide almost unlimited funding for duration or credit risk spreads. A bank doesn't want to depend on rate chasers, but they do want to have them in their back pocket as an alternative source of financing.  There are some exceptions of banks that cater to rate chasers: Capital One, Ally, Discover, Synchrony ... But you will notice that all of them have very high capital needs, needs way in excess of any plausible deposit base, they do it from desperation not desire. 

Normal CD customers buy lots of services and charge the bank less than the prevailing rate.  The bank likes that. If a bank needs money it may go to rate chasers to get it.    But... these loyal customers get furious if the bank offers better CD rates to hot money than they do to them, punishing their loyalty.  Moreover banks don't want to train their loyal customers to be rate chasers.  So they have to somehow offer different rates to different customers in a way that doesn't create cross over.   An online only rate is one such method. The idea being that people with a warm branch relationship don't hear about it (hopefully).  While rate chasers who could care less about being friendly with their teller and local bank manager do hear about it. 

Using brokered CDs at a much higher rate is another similar method. Selling specialty accounts through a deposit broker is another. Generally these brokers are larger banks with lots of customers over the $250k limit.

Just invest everything in SPY, QQQ, or whatever index ETF you're the most comfortable with and hold it for 10 years. You will be far ahead. I can promise you that.
