9,IRS," As someone who dabbles in crypto and use multiple exchanges, as well as majoring in a relevant field(comp sci), I personally wouldn't recommend buying into coinbase until it falls below $100. Here are my reasons:

1. The only thing that sets coinbase apart from its competition, for me as a NYer at least, is that they are the only US based exchange that lets me have an account and cash out into fiat. However, that is as far as coinbase goes when it comes to trading. There are many other international exchanges that charge lower fees, have more features/options, and allow unregulated/untaxed transactions like cryptos are intended for. This advantage only applies to 3 out of the 50 states in the US. That means other exchanges, OGs like binance and kucoin as well as newcomers, are competing in every part of the world outside of these 3 states.
2. Inevitable regulations will be here any moment. Let's not delude ourselves into thinking that the federal and state governments won't start pushing new laws to regulate and tax the crypto market. Coinbase, being on the front page of it all, will undoubtedly take the brunt of the impact since it is based in the US. With regulations/taxes, coinbase will transform into a more tranditional stock broker for crypto. They will report your gains/losses to the IRS, track your public keys and transactions, etc. This is everything crypto is meant to prevent; so it won't look good to crypto owners, who have so many exchanges to choose from.
3. Coinbase was recently busted for illegal trading practices.
4. Many people look at coinbase as the face of crypto, but it is not the biggest by any means. Feel free to go to coinmarketcap and sort exchanges by volume. The fact that you need to scroll down a bunch to find coinbase should tell you all you need to know.

Obviously none of this is financial advice. But I don't see how anyone, with any sort of crypto experience, can believe that coinbase is truly worth more than 40B, nevermind 100B.

20,COIN," For me, it's a pass for 3 reasons:

1) Even in a world of crazy valuations, this is a crazy starting valuation.  As someone pointed out down below, it's trading at the same market cap as Goldman Sachs, who made $17B in profit last year compared to COIN's $600M.  Now, it very well may be worth its current valuation, but what room is there for upside over the next couple of years?

2) A crypto bear market -- which we know is inevitably coming -- will probably decrease revenues for COIN more than it would for a traditional exchange because of lower volumes.  A cryto bear market isn't going to maintain the same volumes you see in traditional stocks -- instead of shorting, etc., I think you'll see a lot of people just sit on the sidelines.

3) Increased coming competition from other exchanges, plus Uniswap.  The more popular crypto becomes -- which is how COIN capitalizes on its first mover advantage -- the more that advantage goes away as new entrants come into the market place.

43,DD," *""unlimited supply, and economic rules change every 6 months""* is a rather misleading statement; if I were reading a DD document I'd throw my hands up there. This is r\/investing, not r\/cryptocurrency :)

Ethereum's supply isn't capped like Bitcoin, but it's not some wild unknown - the supply increases due to the block reward, which is set by the protocol itself.  That's currently fixed at 2 ETH / block, which comes out to around 4.3% supply inflation per year.  Bitcoin by comparison is at (I think?) around 1.7% supply inflation per year for the next while, which is notably lower.

It's true that Ethereum's protocol is subject to change, but so is Bitcoin's -- what's important with a cryptocurrency is what the community consensus is about what changes are allowable, and what ones aren't.  Bitcoin has a commendably very clear narrative about it's economic policy -- PoW, 21 million tokens, no changes allowed ever.  

Ethereum's is a bit different, but can be summed as: ""PoS, with minimum viable issuance for security"".  That hasn't ever changed, and while the specifics may alter during updates, to say ""the rules change every 6 months"" is misleading: While the block reward has been changed a few times since inception, it has *always* been a decrease, never an increase.  As an example: there was a recent proposal from some miners to up the block reward, and it was soundly rejected by the rest of the community.  Stonks go up, block rewards go *down*.

Which leads me to the next two parts on Ethereum's roadmap: EIP-1559, and Proof-of-Stake.  Coming sometime around July is the ""London"" upgrade, which will include a change titled EIP-1559 -- This has a few effects, but economically, it will burn a % of each transaction fee going forward, forever. Estimates are that this will apply 0-1.5% deflationary pressure (depending on fees).  Think of it like a perpetual stock buy-back.

The next part is Ethereum transitioning to Proof of Stake -- the timeline is still being finalized, but the ""beacon chain"" consensus layer is already live, with over $6 billion staked so far, and target is 2021-Q4 - 2022-Q1.  Once that layer takes over, Ethereum's issuance will drop to 0.5%-1%, competitive with Bitcoin.

As part of the ""minimum viable issuance for security"" policy, community concensus is rapidly forming that these policies *will* be permanent: Because when 1559 & PoS are combined, Ethereum supply will actually *decrease* YoY, while at the same time being able to indefinitely pay for security (through block rewards). This opposed to Bitcoin's policy, where eventually block rewards will decrease so far that it's security will *require* higher and higher fees to compensate (if people don't pay enough, the chain may become vulnerable to reorg attack). 

And yes, Ethereum's fees are an issue.  But it's an open market, not a fundamental set by the protocol - people are just getting in a bidding war to get on-chain.  And there's plenty of things being done long-term to address this.  EIP-1559 isn't just about the ""burn"", it also reworks the fee market to fight bidding wars, centralization, and smooth out spikes in demand.  PoS makes blocks more predictable (and slightly faster), reducing urgency that makes people want to bid higher.  ""Layer 2"" technologies are rolling out now.

44,ETH," *""unlimited supply, and economic rules change every 6 months""* is a rather misleading statement; if I were reading a DD document I'd throw my hands up there. This is r\/investing, not r\/cryptocurrency :)

Ethereum's supply isn't capped like Bitcoin, but it's not some wild unknown - the supply increases due to the block reward, which is set by the protocol itself.  That's currently fixed at 2 ETH / block, which comes out to around 4.3% supply inflation per year.  Bitcoin by comparison is at (I think?) around 1.7% supply inflation per year for the next while, which is notably lower.

It's true that Ethereum's protocol is subject to change, but so is Bitcoin's -- what's important with a cryptocurrency is what the community consensus is about what changes are allowable, and what ones aren't.  Bitcoin has a commendably very clear narrative about it's economic policy -- PoW, 21 million tokens, no changes allowed ever.  

Ethereum's is a bit different, but can be summed as: ""PoS, with minimum viable issuance for security"".  That hasn't ever changed, and while the specifics may alter during updates, to say ""the rules change every 6 months"" is misleading: While the block reward has been changed a few times since inception, it has *always* been a decrease, never an increase.  As an example: there was a recent proposal from some miners to up the block reward, and it was soundly rejected by the rest of the community.  Stonks go up, block rewards go *down*.

Which leads me to the next two parts on Ethereum's roadmap: EIP-1559, and Proof-of-Stake.  Coming sometime around July is the ""London"" upgrade, which will include a change titled EIP-1559 -- This has a few effects, but economically, it will burn a % of each transaction fee going forward, forever. Estimates are that this will apply 0-1.5% deflationary pressure (depending on fees).  Think of it like a perpetual stock buy-back.

The next part is Ethereum transitioning to Proof of Stake -- the timeline is still being finalized, but the ""beacon chain"" consensus layer is already live, with over $6 billion staked so far, and target is 2021-Q4 - 2022-Q1.  Once that layer takes over, Ethereum's issuance will drop to 0.5%-1%, competitive with Bitcoin.

As part of the ""minimum viable issuance for security"" policy, community concensus is rapidly forming that these policies *will* be permanent: Because when 1559 & PoS are combined, Ethereum supply will actually *decrease* YoY, while at the same time being able to indefinitely pay for security (through block rewards). This opposed to Bitcoin's policy, where eventually block rewards will decrease so far that it's security will *require* higher and higher fees to compensate (if people don't pay enough, the chain may become vulnerable to reorg attack). 

And yes, Ethereum's fees are an issue.  But it's an open market, not a fundamental set by the protocol - people are just getting in a bidding war to get on-chain.  And there's plenty of things being done long-term to address this.  EIP-1559 isn't just about the ""burn"", it also reworks the fee market to fight bidding wars, centralization, and smooth out spikes in demand.  PoS makes blocks more predictable (and slightly faster), reducing urgency that makes people want to bid higher.  ""Layer 2"" technologies are rolling out now.  Capacity increases (statelessness, sharding) are already having grants issued.

51,IRS," >I think your question betrays a certain naivety about the nature of surveillance in the world, how foreign govs/companies can be compelled by the US government to open the books, and maybe the tax code too. The IRS already has pretty sophisticated chain analytics. All trades, even to stablecoins, are taxable events.

There's nothing naive about questioning the IRS' ability to track crypto. As it stands, they can do very little in that area. It's very easy for you to say ""they are sophisticated and can track it."" But it is the very nature of crypto to be discrete, they are built that way. Again, the mechanics behind tracking funds moving across more secured crypto(s) are not as easy as it sounds. The IRS isn't just fighting foreign exchanges to get access to get data, they are fighting the cryptos/blockchains themselves.

>If you are ok never spending any of your gains in a western country or for products that would be shipped to one, then you can make that sacrifice I suppose. Whenever you try to repatriate the funds, you're going to have to come up with a tax basis too.

What if people slowly move the funds to minimize taxes by staying under a certain tax bracket?

61,ALL," I do get your point but I'm only giving you my own perspective on things as I see it as a Gen X..... Imagine how later generations view it who are piling into crypto with no thought at all for traditional stocks! 

The point I'm making is times and investing IS changing before our very eyes.... if you see it as only high risk, that is your right as well. After all its YOUR capital you are deploying, so its your choice where you put it! 

As for alternative income streams from crypto investments, of course there is. I can stake and receive an on going return with some projects and that return often FAR exceeds any dividend from traditional stocks. 

Yes there is high risk in crypto but like I said because its such an emerging space, as long as you pick good projects, good teams behind them and most importantly projects with real world applications, then be prepared to hold through any major downturns.... chances are good you will be profitable in the long run regardless of market manipulation! Not always but on the whole. 2018 I got hit hard in crypto and took a 75% loss on my initial capital invested. Instead of selling and realising the loss, I just held until 2021. As of last night I'm sitting at 625% increase on that initial investment and I don't have a single cent in Bitcoin. 

People have been saying since bitcoin first started it was a ""bubble"" (I was even 1 of those people!). Thing is, once I actually started looking into the space and researching projects, the value becomes apparent! There are projects that are fundamentally changing how we will do things in the future because of what they are delivering to the marketplace! It really is no different then I'm sure you sit down and assess traditional stocks and companies. To be honest, that's the way I view crypto tokens/coins as well. Im not just buying some coin in the hope it magically goes up in value, I buy it because I want exposure to the ""company"" and the project that it represents. Its a added bonus that it can also be used as a form of payment! 

I see the crypto space as very similar to the dot com period. EVERYONE wanted a piece of this new internet thing and if you were a company that claimed it was ""online"", chances are it got CRAZY valuations! 
Then we had the clean out that had to come (the bubble burst) and all the junk got cleaned out..... but what grew out of that was some of the BIGGEST companies in the world with truly staggering valuations! 

That's what I see happening long term with crypto as well. There will be projects that fundamentally change the way the world works, how money works, how commerce and trade works..... and those valuations will make Amazon, Google and the like look like they have training wheels on.  

There are a HEAP of empty coins that are just straight up scams..... I'm sure the same thing exists or used to exist in penny stocks? But there are still good penny stocks that grow to become major companies and have real value. Its no different in the crypto space! 

To my way of thinking, why would ANYONE invest in traditional stocks any more when the returns are so limited plus the deck is stacked against you by institutional market participants who have access to more information and somehow ""legally"" manipulate prices at will for their own gain at retails loss...... all that risk for say 4% dividend and whatever upside your lucky enough that they let you have.

I see traditional stocks as the nuclear option at this stage because of the blatant manipulation and a regulation framework that protects the institutional participants and their manipulation but will turn around and hold retail investors accountable! 

Ever since 2008 I've lost ALL trust in the traditional system. REAL inflation is sky rocketing, debt is increasing and the same actors are once again betting big knowing that when it all blows up, the government will step in and socialise their losses once again! 

Capitalism is about living and dyeing by the choices YOU make! By creating this concept of to big to fail, we have created a system that encourages stagnation! Out of death, innovative, agile new businesses should grow...... instead what we have is doubling down each time on a failed system that will eventually implode under its own debt load!
The current system is addicted to ever increasing DEBT! I don't believe that cycle can be broken now, its been doubled down on to many times to back out now. 

I see the crypto space AS the innovation that's needed to break away from the failed system, a generational ""reset"" so to speak. Is it going to get messy and a giant bubble pops along the way....... 100%! I actually think we will experience major corrections every few years that traditional investors would view as bubbles popping and market crashes if it happened in the stock market but in crypto it will just be a correction. But when the real bubble busts in crypto, I think its going to be something else all together! And then all that capital will funnel into the projects of substance!

That's just my opinion though but I know that opinion is felt more in each younger generation. Younger generations embrace crypto at a much higher rate. They are a lot more comfortable with the tech and the concepts being reached for and its just a more natural direction for them to gravitate to. 

I'm just relating my own perspective and the perspective that I hear repeated by younger generations.

Stock is down from $48 before pandemic to $33, hasn’t gone back up while others banks have, trading below book value. Fake accounts CEO and people involved in it are long gone, banned from banking altogether even, stock undervalued by investors who don’t trust the bank even though it’s management has been completely revamped, but consumers forget faster, new CEO has a lot of experience, knows how a good bank works, worked with Visa and Chase. Priced in massive inefficiency which is decreasing thanks to the new CEO’s efforts and can only decrease. Regulators have been steadily removing restrictions, asset cap being the big one to watch out for, it has cost WFC around 4 billion dollars, the stock is gonna go up a lot once it does. You’re probablynot gonna get rich off of WFC but it’s as sure of a bet as you can get, while also not making peanuts, it has a lot of room to not only recover from pre-pandemic price, but to increase even more.

Ever since my previous post a month, the stock has gone from $33 to $39, reaching $41 recently, a 20% increase, driven mostly by regulators accepting an asset cap lift plan, which will cause a big spike in the stock price once it gets completed and the asset cap lifted. Next week are earnings, which will reflect, even if not fully, the many efforts Wells Fargo new management has made to cut costs and increase margins. If you want to make a quick buck, I suggest buying and holding at least until the asset cap is lifted, but long term the bank still has a LOT of room to grow, since it already has a solid position, but it is still rebuilding its management and business plan. With the end of COVID in sight, which will restore consumer banking, a better structure, and a plan for its asset cap to be removed, WFC is in a better position than it was before the pandemic, yet its stock price doesn’t reveal that, and I believe it to be due to very frightened investors who still treat the company as having the previous, corrupt management, and as such it is a very valuable investment.

84,WFC," Very good question! That PE ratio is based on last earnings, today’s earnings would put them at around ~40 PE ratio, Wells Fargo has a higher than usual PE ratio because some investors, like me, see that Wells Fargo has a lot of potential, with a lot of assets but really high inefficiency. If WFC current management can reduce their inefficiency they have the potential to make a lot more profits. The new CEO so far has been cutting unnecessary costs and management, and these results prove that it’s working. That’s not to mention they already made a plan with the regulators to remove their asset cap, and so removing that will put them in an even better position. Other banks like Chase are already well positioned and making good profits, Wells Fargo has been really lacking for the past few years, from their position they can only improve.",Tropink,22,/r/investing/comments/mqusy8/wfc_wells_fargo_posts_profits_of_474_billion_up/guierzc/,0.01,0.752,0.237,0.9891

As someone who used to do things like this (for the Government, lol) it's a way to pay for a contractor to onboard a tool or integration, but it doesn't solve the original core problem.  

* Why are we creating so many different systems which do the same thing?
* How come we aren't EoL'ng systems that need it, allocating resources?
* Why are we introducing a new integration, and why won't this fall into the same trap of yet another new system?
* How come we aren't upgrading or migrating to newer technology?

5 EV startups projected they'll hit $10b in revenue faster than Google, the current record holder for fastest to $10b.

Canoo touted a subscription model, an engineering services business, and a partnership with Hyundai.  On their first earnings call, they announced the Hyundai deal was dead, they were transitioning to developing IP for their own products (ie engineering services is dead), and that their subscription model wasn't actually financially viable.  And their CFO left.  One analyst asked if their CEO was still employed in the Q&A (lol).

Lordstown got caught juicing pre-orders.  BREAKING:  Steve Burns is still a hack.  This one shouldn't have surprised anyone...

Multiplan gave projections out to 2025 in the first half of 2020, before they merged.  As a public company, they gave no guidance for 2021 in their Q4 earnings call.

The sum of the revenue projections from Lidar startups that SPAC'd gives $4.6B in 2025.  The projected Lidar TAM in 2025 is \~$3.8B, and these companies have virtually 0 market share today.

Many of these companies are doing really cool things.  However, the devil is in the details about whether what they're doing is going to be profitable anytime soon.  And they have a HUGE financial incentive to encourage their investors, backers and partners to think that it will.

Personally I'm done with SPACS.  Their valuations are crazy.  Their technologies fantastical.  Their partnerships dubious.

Usually when I see unexplained spikes on stocks that typically have low volume and float - those stocks can be prone to be more easily manipulated by stock promoters. I.e. pump and dump. 

Thanks for offering that important tidbit about the split.  It looks like a lot of data feeds such as on Yahoo have not yet split adjusted correctly. I just checked on my brokerage platform and I see the correct stock prices.  That solved the mystery of the odd spike that I noticed. Thanks for mentioning the split.

Hi again, I have another newbie question again.

What are the most reccomended indicators and overlays to use when trading? Right now I mainly use SMA (100), EMA(100) for overlays and RSI and MACD as my indicators. After that I check the EPS and PER plus the EBITDA.

I think it works, but honestly I'm not knowledgeable enough to asses whether this are the most useful indicators/overlays or not, so I ask.
