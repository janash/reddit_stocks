36,IRS," As someone who dabbles in crypto and use multiple exchanges, as well as majoring in a relevant field(comp sci), I personally wouldn't recommend buying into coinbase until it falls below $100. Here are my reasons:

1. The only thing that sets coinbase apart from its competition, for me as a NYer at least, is that they are the only US based exchange that lets me have an account and cash out into fiat. However, that is as far as coinbase goes when it comes to trading. There are many other international exchanges that charge lower fees, have more features/options, and allow unregulated/untaxed transactions like cryptos are intended for. This advantage only applies to 3 out of the 50 states in the US. That means other exchanges, OGs like binance and kucoin as well as newcomers, are competing in every part of the world outside of these 3 states.
2. Inevitable regulations will be here any moment. Let's not delude ourselves into thinking that the federal and state governments won't start pushing new laws to regulate and tax the crypto market. Coinbase, being on the front page of it all, will undoubtedly take the brunt of the impact since it is based in the US. With regulations/taxes, coinbase will transform into a more tranditional stock broker for crypto. They will report your gains/losses to the IRS, track your public keys and transactions, etc. This is everything crypto is meant to prevent; so it won't look good to crypto owners, who have so many exchanges to choose from.
3. Coinbase was recently busted for illegal trading practices.
4. Many people look at coinbase as the face of crypto, but it is not the biggest by any means. Feel free to go to coinmarketcap and sort exchanges by volume. The fact that you need to scroll down a bunch to find coinbase should tell you all you need to know.

Obviously none of this is financial advice. But I don't see how anyone, with any sort of crypto experience, can believe that coinbase is truly worth more than 40B, nevermind 100B.

49,COIN," For me, it's a pass for 3 reasons:

1) Even in a world of crazy valuations, this is a crazy starting valuation.  As someone pointed out down below, it's trading at the same market cap as Goldman Sachs, who made $17B in profit last year compared to COIN's $600M.  Now, it very well may be worth its current valuation, but what room is there for upside over the next couple of years?

2) A crypto bear market -- which we know is inevitably coming -- will probably decrease revenues for COIN more than it would for a traditional exchange because of lower volumes.  A cryto bear market isn't going to maintain the same volumes you see in traditional stocks -- instead of shorting, etc., I think you'll see a lot of people just sit on the sidelines.

3) Increased coming competition from other exchanges, plus Uniswap.  The more popular crypto becomes -- which is how COIN capitalizes on its first mover advantage -- the more that advantage goes away as new entrants come into the market place.

79,DD," *""unlimited supply, and economic rules change every 6 months""* is a rather misleading statement; if I were reading a DD document I'd throw my hands up there. This is r\/investing, not r\/cryptocurrency :)

Ethereum's supply isn't capped like Bitcoin, but it's not some wild unknown - the supply increases due to the block reward, which is set by the protocol itself.  That's currently fixed at 2 ETH / block, which comes out to around 4.3% supply inflation per year.  Bitcoin by comparison is at (I think?) around 1.7% supply inflation per year for the next while, which is notably lower.

It's true that Ethereum's protocol is subject to change, but so is Bitcoin's -- what's important with a cryptocurrency is what the community consensus is about what changes are allowable, and what ones aren't.  Bitcoin has a commendably very clear narrative about it's economic policy -- PoW, 21 million tokens, no changes allowed ever.  

Ethereum's is a bit different, but can be summed as: ""PoS, with minimum viable issuance for security"".  That hasn't ever changed, and while the specifics may alter during updates, to say ""the rules change every 6 months"" is misleading: While the block reward has been changed a few times since inception, it has *always* been a decrease, never an increase.  As an example: there was a recent proposal from some miners to up the block reward, and it was soundly rejected by the rest of the community.  Stonks go up, block rewards go *down*.

Which leads me to the next two parts on Ethereum's roadmap: EIP-1559, and Proof-of-Stake.  Coming sometime around July is the ""London"" upgrade, which will include a change titled EIP-1559 -- This has a few effects, but economically, it will burn a % of each transaction fee going forward, forever. Estimates are that this will apply 0-1.5% deflationary pressure (depending on fees).  Think of it like a perpetual stock buy-back.

The next part is Ethereum transitioning to Proof of Stake -- the timeline is still being finalized, but the ""beacon chain"" consensus layer is already live, with over $6 billion staked so far, and target is 2021-Q4 - 2022-Q1.  Once that layer takes over, Ethereum's issuance will drop to 0.5%-1%, competitive with Bitcoin.

As part of the ""minimum viable issuance for security"" policy, community concensus is rapidly forming that these policies *will* be permanent: Because when 1559 & PoS are combined, Ethereum supply will actually *decrease* YoY, while at the same time being able to indefinitely pay for security (through block rewards). This opposed to Bitcoin's policy, where eventually block rewards will decrease so far that it's security will *require* higher and higher fees to compensate (if people don't pay enough, the chain may become vulnerable to reorg attack). 

And yes, Ethereum's fees are an issue.  But it's an open market, not a fundamental set by the protocol - people are just getting in a bidding war to get on-chain.  And there's plenty of things being done long-term to address this.  EIP-1559 isn't just about the ""burn"", it also reworks the fee market to fight bidding wars, centralization, and smooth out spikes in demand.  PoS makes blocks more predictable (and slightly faster), reducing urgency that makes people want to bid higher.  ""Layer 2"" technologies are rolling out now.  Capacity increases (statelessness, sharding) are already having grants issued. 

**tl;dr** I'd argue the ""minimum viable issuance for security"" outlined above makes Ethereum an idea store of value and unit of account, as it contains both a control on supply inflation, AND a mechanism to indefinitely ensure network security (which is required for long term trust).",ryebit,5,/r/investing/comments/mr2m8u/coinbase_deep_dive_diligence_part_1_of_2/gulq7hp/,0.122,0.782,0.096,-0.9333

There's nothing naive about questioning the IRS' ability to track crypto. As it stands, they can do very little in that area. It's very easy for you to say ""they are sophisticated and can track it."" But it is the very nature of crypto to be discrete, they are built that way. Again, the mechanics behind tracking funds moving across more secured crypto(s) are not as easy as it sounds. The IRS isn't just fighting foreign exchanges to get access to get data, they are fighting the cryptos/blockchains themselves.

Tell me the economic rules are set in stone, and it's a predictable supply. In the last 3 years the issuance changed *7* times. And this is not predictable changes, you had no idea it would do this when Ethereum launched. I can tell you today what the issuance of Bitcoin will be in 54, 78 or 120 years. Can you with Ethereum?

Every metrics you just wrote about regarding the inflation/deflation are then worthless. Ethereum has been promising ETH 2.0 since I got interested in it in April 2017, 4 years ago. 

Bitcoin is boring. But that's the point. It's predictable, rules are set in stone and never changed since its inception. That's what you want for a reliable store of value.

102,CC," I don't think anyone's claimed the economic rules are set in stone. I certainly didn't in my comment there.

""Minimum viable issuance for security"" is what I said. I think your chart actually proves my point -- block issuance has gone down since inception, no proposal to increase it has ever been accepted by devs or by the community.  

What will the issuance of Bitcoin be in 120 years? Actually, I don't think *any* one can be sure of that.  Once bitcoin's block reward drops below the point where it can pay for security (which will be long before it hits 0), network fees are going to have to grow proportionally.  But that will require people to *volunteer* to pay more, which I don't see happening; not at least until Bitcoin suffers a major reorg attack. At which point, they may decide to pay more -- or everyone may decide it's better to alter the protocol, and extend issuance out a bit.  Blockchain ""layer 0"" is social consensus, which is never truly set in stone, or we'd still be speaking Latin. 

Regarding Ethereum promising staking -- yeah, it took a few years of research.  And last year, the beacon chain actually launched.  $6 billion staked right now means a huge incentive to make it go live quickly but prudently. 

I agree Bitcoin is boring ... now.  But it's had software bugs, chain reorgs, features that were turned off, it's not set in stone, and certainly wasn't for first 5 years of it's life.  Let's not start treating these things with religious fervor -- they're investments, and software protocols people agree to support, not magic tablets.

105,ALL," I do get your point but I'm only giving you my own perspective on things as I see it as a Gen X..... Imagine how later generations view it who are piling into crypto with no thought at all for traditional stocks! 

The point I'm making is times and investing IS changing before our very eyes.... if you see it as only high risk, that is your right as well. After all its YOUR capital you are deploying, so its your choice where you put it! 

As for alternative income streams from crypto investments, of course there is. I can stake and receive an on going return with some projects and that return often FAR exceeds any dividend from traditional stocks. 

Yes there is high risk in crypto but like I said because its such an emerging space, as long as you pick good projects, good teams behind them and most importantly projects with real world applications, then be prepared to hold through any major downturns.... chances are good you will be profitable in the long run regardless of market manipulation! Not always but on the whole. 2018 I got hit hard in crypto and took a 75% loss on my initial capital invested. Instead of selling and realising the loss, I just held until 2021. As of last night I'm sitting at 625% increase on that initial investment and I don't have a single cent in Bitcoin. 

People have been saying since bitcoin first started it was a ""bubble"" (I was even 1 of those people!). Thing is, once I actually started looking into the space and researching projects, the value becomes apparent! There are projects that are fundamentally changing how we will do things in the future because of what they are delivering to the marketplace! It really is no different then I'm sure you sit down and assess traditional stocks and companies. To be honest, that's the way I view crypto tokens/coins as well. Im not just buying some coin in the hope it magically goes up in value, I buy it because I want exposure to the ""company"" and the project that it represents. Its a added bonus that it can also be used as a form of payment! 

I see the crypto space as very similar to the dot com period. EVERYONE wanted a piece of this new internet thing and if you were a company that claimed it was ""online"", chances are it got CRAZY valuations! 
Then we had the clean out that had to come (the bubble burst) and all the junk got cleaned out..... but what grew out of that was some of the BIGGEST companies in the world with truly staggering valuations! 

That's what I see happening long term with crypto as well. There will be projects that fundamentally change the way the world works, how money works, how commerce and trade works..... and those valuations will make Amazon, Google and the like look like they have training wheels on.  

There are a HEAP of empty coins that are just straight up scams..... I'm sure the same thing exists or used to exist in penny stocks? But there are still good penny stocks that grow to become major companies and have real value. Its no different in the crypto space! 

To my way of thinking, why would ANYONE invest in traditional stocks any more when the returns are so limited plus the deck is stacked against you by institutional market participants who have access to more information and somehow ""legally"" manipulate prices at will for their own gain at retails loss...... all that risk for say 4% dividend and whatever upside your lucky enough that they let you have.

I see traditional stocks as the nuclear option at this stage because of the blatant manipulation and a regulation framework that protects the institutional participants and their manipulation but will turn around and hold retail investors accountable! 

Ever since 2008 I've lost ALL trust in the traditional system. REAL inflation is sky rocketing, debt is increasing and the same actors are once again betting big knowing that when it all blows up, the government will step in and socialise their losses once again! 

Capitalism is about living and dyeing by the choices YOU make! By creating this concept of to big to fail, we have created a system that encourages stagnation! Out of death, innovative, agile new businesses should grow...... instead what we have is doubling down each time on a failed system that will eventually implode under its own debt load!
The current system is addicted to ever increasing DEBT! I don't believe that cycle can be broken now, its been doubled down on to many times to back out now. 

I see the crypto space AS the innovation that's needed to break away from the failed system, a generational ""reset"" so to speak. Is it going to get messy and a giant bubble pops along the way....... 100%! I actually think we will experience major corrections every few years that traditional investors would view as bubbles popping and market crashes if it happened in the stock market but in crypto it will just be a correction. But when the real bubble busts in crypto, I think its going to be something else all together! And then all that capital will funnel into the projects of substance!

That's just my opinion though but I know that opinion is felt more in each younger generation. Younger generations embrace crypto at a much higher rate. They are a lot more comfortable with the tech and the concepts being reached for and its just a more natural direction for them to gravitate to. 

I'm just relating my own perspective and the perspective that I hear repeated by younger generations. I'm not saying I am right or that anyone else has to listen to it.... but if enough people all have the same perspective, it doesn't take long to see that change can happen and a new reality exists.

120,IP," It's amazing the things pre-merger SPAC targets get away with saying.  They effectively aren't liable for their claims before they're actually publicly traded.

5 EV startups projected they'll hit $10b in revenue faster than Google, the current record holder for fastest to $10b.

Canoo touted a subscription model, an engineering services business, and a partnership with Hyundai.  On their first earnings call, they announced the Hyundai deal was dead, they were transitioning to developing IP for their own products (ie engineering services is dead), and that their subscription model wasn't actually financially viable.  And their CFO left.  One analyst asked if their CEO was still employed in the Q&A (lol).

Lordstown got caught juicing pre-orders.  BREAKING:  Steve Burns is still a hack.  This one shouldn't have surprised anyone...

Multiplan gave projections out to 2025 in the first half of 2020, before they merged.  As a public company, they gave no guidance for 2021 in their Q4 earnings call.

The sum of the revenue projections from Lidar startups that SPAC'd gives $4.6B in 2025.  The projected Lidar TAM in 2025 is \~$3.8B, and these companies have virtually 0 market share today.

The Nikola GM partnership was actually much more nuanced and favored GM.  Nikola was playing it up to give themselves street cred.

Curious if the same thing will be said about the VW QS partnership in a year.

One thing that's become clear to me in the wake of stories like Enron, Theranos, Nikola and a lot of these SPACS.  Just because you have a big name backer or industry partner does NOT mean the company isn't exaggerating or fraudulent.  The relationship between the SPAC and the partners & backers if often not accurately depicted.

Many of these companies are doing really cool things.  However, the devil is in the details about whether what they're doing is going to be profitable anytime soon.  And they have a HUGE financial incentive to encourage their investors, backers and partners to think that it will.

Personally I'm done with SPACS.  Their valuations are crazy.  Their technologies fantastical.  Their partnerships dubious.

From what I understand the company isn’t marketing their salmon as high-end, rather as “affordable”. Will it take a buyer in the human food supply chain to boost the company, or could a Nestle-Purina level buyer be even more advantageous? Or is the pet food sector price point too low to sustain the company?

195,DD," $GMBL is on sale. I am an investor in them. I can write out my DD but its best for you to research it on your own. If you are unfamiliar, they are an igaming and egaming company with 4 current gambling licenses and a 5th on the way in NJ which will be awarded this spring and lead to the launch of the first ESports gambling platform in the United States. (Set to go live in the coming months)


They are projecting 70m in revenue in 2022 based only on current projections of the businesses they've acquired (helix and ggCircuit acquisitions close in a couple months) They currently have a market cap just over 3x those revenue projections.


They announced today that ggcircuit and Helix have developed custom mining software to allow their networks gaming PCs in their 10 gaming LAN centers to mine crypto while not in use for gaming. Passive income while not in-use.


They have partnerships with 4 NFL teams as well as an NHL team and are talking to 22 other NFL teams currently. The idea there is to include egaming facilities with the sports facilities like HELIX currently has in place with the NE Patriots at 1 patriots place. A highly profitable egaming center (prior to covid)


Ok, so i guess I shared a little DD. This is not advice but I have seen a price target of $30 as early as March and while the stock price has fallen dramatically in the last week (on no negative news) I think this a rock solid growth company and this is as good as the price may ever get (once this bear run ends. Maybe at $11, maybe at $8)

Though, I guess if you have a plan where you sell the call at a price enough above your cost that you're fine with it getting called away and then maybe selling a cash covered put or something like that. You could always run a strategy there.

I just know I've made a decent amount of premiums selling CCs at $40 on some BAC shares I own. But my cost basis is $22.50 on them, so I don't care if they got called at $40. And, the stock has traded higher, and has gone over $40 at times, but never quite reached the break even for those calls to get exercised. So, it's worked out well, but BAC doesn't have the same volatility that $COIN is likely to have for a while.",NativeTxn7,1,/r/investing/comments/mrf2nf/coin_after_ipo_thought_process_please_critique_my/gumlypv/,0.05,0.835,0.115,0.8903

238,CL," I'm looking for help with Crude Oil.

So I figured to start learning about investing I would watch a sector rather than a specific company, maybe investing in some of the ETF's instead.

Anyways, I've been watching /CL and noticed it trending upwards as of mid-yesterday. I looked around for news relating to oil and saw a few things.

One about oil production in the Gulf ([https://www.bicmagazine.com/industry/offshore-marine/gulf-of-mexico-crude-oil-production-will-increase-with-new-p/](https://www.bicmagazine.com/industry/offshore-marine/gulf-of-mexico-crude-oil-production-will-increase-with-new-p/))

and another about how the price of oil was stagnating in anticipation of an OPEC meeting ([https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/crude-oil-price-forecast-crude-oil-continues-to-wait-for-opec-715618](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/crude-oil-price-forecast-crude-oil-continues-to-wait-for-opec-715618)).

&#x200B;

My question is, are these two examples at least part of what caused the price to stagnate (referring to the OPEC example) and then to ride (Gulf example), or have I not found a more key event? I'm not familiar with how futures work but I thought much of the pricing would have been factored in a while ago.

I was also wondering what else I can do to learn about fluctuations in the prices. The only thing I can think to check aside from regular news is maybe the Crude Oil Report ( which I believe I have found here [https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/supply/weekly/](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/supply/weekly/) ).
