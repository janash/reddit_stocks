3,GM, Ford is the most dependable and well built American company. And the new EV mustang looks great. Not sure why I would want it over a Tesla besides my life long love of ford though.

They're not known for anything...They don't innovate. Their vehicles (minus the F-150) are not as durable and efficient as competitors.

The only traditional automaker that I think shows the best promise in transtioning to EVs is Volkswagon in my opinion.

13,GT," Agreed. That’s a $78 billion market cap. 

With that said I love their new EV line. The Mustang looks sweet and the GT premium performs 0-60 in 3.5 seconds selling in the $60s. The Taycan 4S does 3.9 seconds STARTING at $110K. Audi E-Tron GT does it in 3.1 seconds starting at $100K. 

The F-150 looks fantastic and starts at $58K. Similar to the Cybertruck pricing and compared to the hummer $110K it seems like a steal. 

They are bringing a higher performing electric vehicle that a lot more people can afford. I hope it continues and if successful they could be the leading manufacturer of electric vehicles in the US soon. 

I think a price point of $15 or so with a market cap of $58 billion seems reasonable to me over the next year or so. Maybe it does hit that $20 if actually the leader in the US in a couple years. Not crazy. 

What is crazy is Tesla market cap of $577 billion.  Other people will catch up.

14,GM," This. Normally, when an industry is forced to spend capital due to an external trend or factors (in this case, societies moving away from gas powered cars), it's not the companies (or their profits) that benefit. 

The EV shift is somewhat different though since there will be winners and losers, some incumbents aren't going to make it. So you could argue that if GM and Ford survive the transition to EVs, their prospects will be good in that new competitive landscape. The other thing is that governments are going to subsidize EVs so in theory, Ford (as a relatively early mover) could benefit from this.

45,AAPL," OP there are several kinds of stop losses. The one that's relevant here would be a stop loss, and a stop limit. I'll use your example and set the values at -5% for both.

AAPL is worth $100. It drops down to $70 all of a sudden.

Stop loss: It triggers a market sell order when the stock drops below $95. Since it dropped so quickly and everyone's market order for a sell order is trying to activate.. your order might actually sell at the bottom of the dip. You've now sold the shares for $70 each. Or possibly, anywhere from $70 to $95.

Stop limit: It triggers a sell order for EXACTLY $95. Since the stock dropped to $70 so quickly, no one is interested in your sell order of $95 as everyone else is selling it for $70 - $71.

If the security price drops below your stop loss, say $95, you will sell your position at ANY price. Most of the time, it is around $95.

There are currently zero drugs for these two issues - most just try to manage symptoms. Bad cases lead to hysterectomies. I’ve known people who’ve been on disability because of endometriosis - can be debilitating and crippling pain. So there’s a need to be met and they’re the first of the kind.

Dirt cheap - can sell options against position while it treads water - I think it is a prime candidate to explode or get bought out by a larger company.

Maxeon spun off from its parent company, Sunpower. Sunpower had a contract signed more than 10 years ago, where they had to buy polysilicone at a fixed price. Right now, this price from the contract is much higher than the market price, and the contract was transferred to Maxeon. So until the end of 2022, they basically have to pay triple or smth like that the market price of this material.

When adjusting for the losses caused by this contract, MAXN should be profitable. I’m planning to accumulate stock until 2022. When the burden of this out-of-market polysilicone contract phases out, they will probably shoot up.

If you are long congrats. However if you are gonna tell me about their amazing tech & innovation fuck off!  UPST is just another overvalued, Ai, SaaS, Payment High-flyer who forgot it’s 2021 but IPO’ed late last year under the shadow of ABNB & DASH however just like the ladder two GOLDMAN is also their Godfather (took all 3 public) and GS takes care of it’s babies.  Compared to it’s more celebrated peers UPST was of to a slow start. IPO’ed at $20 (the low end of the range $20 - $24), hardly drew any buzz and post IPO sat around for a few days kinda lost. 

GOLDMAN TO THE RESCUE: Once Goldman shoved a stupidly high valuation which the market accepted for ABNB & DASH then it focused it’s attention on poor little UPST and started to drive interest for the shares (part of the GS starter kit when you select them to run your IPO which founders & round investors love.  They need to make sure to pump the price hard before lock-up expiration *THIS IS KEY.

RECAP: UPST, went public at $20 in Dec the week after the other two and once public had a $1.8 Billion valuation and already trading at a rich valuation (just earlier in 2020 it has been valued around $800MM).  

TODAY’s VALUATIONS: Fast forward; today UPST is valued over $10 Billion trading at a whopping $135 per share Est PE: 200X PS: 40X PB: 30X (regardless of future potential growth these are disgustingly high valuations) oh JUST OVER 40% OF THE SHARES ARE STILL LOCKED!  

TRADE / LOCKUP EXPIRATION / JULY: Lock you for UPST is scheduled for early July which will increase the float by 40% and this event will trigger pressure on the shares (round investors selling, in creasing the supply) and mixed with a higher interest rate environment and stupid high valuations WILL CUT THE CURRENT PRICE BY AT LEAST 50%. (You know very well every single 2020 high flyer was cut in half this year. UPST is no exception just delayed). 

PROOF:  Goldman was the investment bank for several other similar IPO’s and applied the same formula.  Check to procure movements, IPO, ramp up, expiration lockup followed by substantial decrease of share prices.  SNOW, DASH, ABNB, BIGC, FROG, PLTR.

358,AEO," Metrics are pretty wonky right now, and nothing is really normal.  
But historically I've looked for a few things;.  
1) A P/E ratio of 15 or less AND a Forward P/E ratio that is *lower.* A lower FPE ratio means the company will be making more money next year than this year.  
2) Good inside ownership, especially from the top brass. They're looking out for the shareholders best interest, which includes themselves. Share buybacks are good, too.  
3) A decent dividend that is raised every year or so. The longer the history, the better.  
4) No debt. Debt can help a company to grow for a while, but it can eventually cripple the company.  
Many other investors will have their own criteria, but the points I mentioned are my favorite, and I have a hard time passing on a stock that meets those criteria. AEO usually one of the ones that meets the criteria, but I wouldn't touch it with a 10-ft pole right now due to the excessive share price increase.

Also, sometimes you just need to keep your ear to the ground. Right when Blackberry was starting to meme, they issued a PR saying they didn't know why their stock was going up, and that their CEO (?) had recently sold all of his shares. Never a good sign. My historical favorite has been AEO, and I do whatever the CEO does. His family has been in the industry for a few generations IIRC, and he always seems to know exactly when to buy at the bottom.

But I keep my eye on news articles every month or 2.  
And watch out for high dividend yields; they look nice now, but that can indicate a problem with the stock. Example: if the share price goes down 50%, the dividend yield goes up 100%. The company is much more likely to cut it to conserve cash. If you like high dividends tho, I found HRZN last year. They are a ""business development company's and regularly pay out 7-10% per year.

Also, sometimes you just need to keep your ear to the ground. Right when Blackberry was starting to meme, they issued a PR saying they didn't know why their stock was going up, and that their CEO (?) had recently sold all of his shares. Never a good sign. My historical favorite has been AEO, and I do whatever the CEO does. His family has been in the industry for a few generations IIRC, and he always seems to know exactly when to buy at the bottom. He often also knows when to sell at the top. So I just follow that stock long-term. Sometimes I go 2-3 years without investing in it, then when it drops, I'll hit it hard.

369,MET," I’m not sure this applies if I adjusted my portfolio within the time period, but at 24 years, I am at about 120% ROI. 

TLDR:  pick companies you know, understand biz model and try to form scenarios on when you buy or sell, try not to time the market. Don’t panic sell. 

I have a “play account” where I trade more often and TBH, just having stable companions like P&G, Amazon, Financials like MET, V, I’ve done probably better with the long-term portfolio. 

Learned to be disciplined and really understand the company business model. Going off the hypothesis of their model has helped me stay disciplined where when the market would crash, I would buy incrementally more. 

I also would set goals for myself and if something got to a target ROI, I’d take some off the top. That has left me leaving $ on the table, which sucked, but my losses haven’t been as drastic. 

Mistakes I have made have included:
1.  Getting into an IPO on the first days. It’s not worth it to chase the hype. SNAP went to $26 and then to $12 for a long time. It’s okay to have patience because things do go down.

371,PLUG," I am 50 years old and 20 years in on stock trading.

In my own individual trades, my gambles and bets have far and away been my best trades.  It is certainly possible to find those trades from time to time.  In particular in growth/speculation stocks.

I let professional money managers manage my nest egg.  They get consistent returns and they manage to mostly avoid the big drops.  I have my own account where I speculate.

In retrospect I am almost always wrong about why I get 5x returns from a stock.  For example my last stock to get those returns was PLUG.  I thought they were a good company with a promising technology.  In retrospect it was a pump and dump, and their CEO is a good con man, who leveraged his relationship with Chuck Schumer in his pump and dump scheme.

If you think the businesses held in these ETFs are good businesses, perhaps it’s an opportunity to accumulate more.

I once bought 100 shares of NFLX at $60 and watched it drop down 20% over the next two months. But their business hadn’t changed in those two months, only the share price had.  So I bought 100 more.

385,AAPL," Heres my opinion. Small caps inherently have more room to grow than large caps, it's much easier to go from 500 million to 1 billion than from 500 billion to 1 trillion.

However, most small cap stocks won't be around in the future/won't have seen that exponential growth. I think it's much more likely that MSFT, AAPL etc stick around and continue to grow vs a much smaller startup company that might go bankrupt.

But also, there are very likely a few small cap stocks out there that are genuinely good companies that WILL outperform large caps if all goes well. I think in general, well established companies with long history have more trust and are much safer. The majority, or at least a lot of the small cap stocks don't have that going for them. However, the few small caps that are able to grow, scale and earn a reputation will likely grow at a faster rate than the biggest market cap stocks.

To summarize: Small cap stocks can grow faster but most of them likely won't. There are probably a few winners here and there but those are the exception. My 2 cents",Microtonal_Valley,6,/r/stocks/comments/nh8ow5/discussion_will_small_and_mid_caps_actually/gyuyb32/,0.011,0.863,0.126,0.9729

387,DD," My key takeaway is that you’ve learned a lot, but haven’t succeeded.   yet.  

Realistically if you want to get back in the market, you should probably just try to pile some cash up that you won’t need in the near term.   Fear is a powerful driver and if you need that money for a house / car / emergency then you’re going to react.   Just because you haven’t succeeded yet doesn’t mean you won’t.

It’s generally not too hard to at least break even in the market, you just have to  do DD, buy low, and not sell if it’s below what you paid for it.   Trying to game and time things almost never works for ordinary people.   If you’re still holding then just wait another year, whatever you were in has a strong chance it will come back up.   I’ve been down 50% in a position and just buy more and go outside, it’s always worked out for me so far.

People are all panicked about a potential crash in the medium to near term future, and it’s probably going to happen.   If you can’t afford to be 50% down for a year or more and still hold then put the money somewhere safer.   Trying to move to quickly is usually a big problem for beginners.",rgar132,4,/r/stocks/comments/nh8jr8/trading_psychology_question_assistance_please/gyv4u2r/,0.09,0.807,0.103,0.2946

Initially, I was hugely disappointed by my returns, especially watching all these meme stocks become high fliers while the stocks I chose were either stagnant or had little gains. I started to question what I was doing wrong. And still do. But when things started to change in the market the companies that I had chosen handled all the negativity in the market much better than the high flyers. 

I have also noted the stock market is like a huge game. The media is used to create fear, doubt, and any other kind of negative emotion to make one question his/her market picks. All I can do is continue to learn, not take any huge risks, and KEEP trying.

this is the equivalent of a consistently A student saying he's going to get an A on the next test. if he gets an A, are you going to go WOW THIS IS SO UNEXPECTED? no, you'll be like ok cool, you did what you said you would.

now, if you had a D student say he was going to get an A on his next test, sure you might be surprised by the announcement but over time, you'll probably forget. But then, if he actually manages to pull off an A, you'll be completely shocked and probably reward him well. Meeting expectations is the bare minimum.
