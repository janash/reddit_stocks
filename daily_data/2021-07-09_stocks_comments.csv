Especially in an industry with volatile labor issues at a time regulators are closely watching them?

12,ABNB," One big red flag... Liability.

Lesser flags... not profitable, incredibly bad PR, and not needed for food delivery since that might be automated soon anyway. There are tons of upstarts making sandboxed delivery drones so why would you need lyft?

This is why I doubt this will happen. This is why I think Google is spinning off Waymo. No one in their right mind wants that liability nor PR nightmare related with these taxi services. There is simply no upside to it and they have so many better ways to spend that money that it makes no sense. They are 10x better off buying out another studio and solidifying Prime streaming especially since they host everything themselves. This is highly profitable and much less risky.

The only possible way I see Amazon buying into any of these taxi services is if they have full automated driving. And even then it will be at arms length. Kind of like how they bought into Rivian but as a hands off investor. But we are no where even close to achieving that with current tech. At best we have small ice boxes on wheels that deliver food at slow speeds (which will be infuriating in urban areas) in very tightly controlled routes (aka sandboxed). I can see Amazon buying into those if they havent invested heavily already.

Otherwise, I dont see this happening. I can see others going after Uber/Lyft but not Amazon. For example, I can see a Lyft + Waymo merger once Waymo is independent. That makes sense especially if Google is off the hook and its all on someone elses dime (aka investors). I can see ABNB + Lyft.

18,SO," I find it odd to consider Amazon like Standard Oil. SO derived it’s monopolistic power through acquisitions of rival refineries and distributors; purely horizontal integration, followed by outright price fixing.

Amazon is absolutely massive, but the growth method and diversity of markets they participate in distinguishes them from old trust oriented monopolies. I’m terms of AWS, the majority of growth was organic, and would not have ran afoul of antitrust law back in its hay day, such as when US v. Aluminum Co. of America was prevailing law.

An attempt to break up Amazon by business segment would probably fail due to the shift since the 70’s from Per Se Antitrust violations to the Rule of Reason. They aren’t dominating any given sector to the point that a court could likely prove anti-consumer behavior, which has increasingly become the prime factor.

Online shopping has a fairly rich market with Walmart, Home Depot, Best Buy, wayfair, etc.; physical stores obviously have Walmart and target being dominant; subscription services are still beaten by Netflix and Google, with Disney catching up fast; AWS competes with Oracle, Microsoft snd Google.

Overall I think the justifications for breaking up Amazon are weak in light of the method of growth, the fact that they aren’t shutting out competitors in any given industry right now, and our much more consumer viewpoint focus on antitrust enforcement.",Nosefuroughtto,80,/r/stocks/comments/oguvtc/i_predict_amazon_will_acquire_lyft_within_the/h4lpzte/,0.081,0.789,0.129,0.8898

24,MGM," The determination as to whether a particular company is a monopoly is relevant to jurisdiction because separate jurisdictions will have different rules regarding how a monopoly is defined, who makes that determination, what evidence may be considered, and what remedies are available. Different countries can have radically different methodologies in considering each of these areas. By the way, judicial review applies to constitutionality of statutes, not the application doctrine of the law itself; a superior court does not need to make a determination in forum selection, because that's not how court proceedings work; and an index calculation itself is an article of evidence that falls within the forum's evidentiary proceedings, not a basis for evidence admission.

Jurisdiction is as important in the determination of a monopoly as the activities of an international business' operations. In *In re Vitamin C Litigation*, defendants were a Chinese based supplier that was found to have price fixed goods on US soil. This was no considered an antitrust violation within the purview of the CCP's Ministry of Commerce; in fact, their government regulatory body, MOFCOM, defended them in the US Court. The Court held in favor of the plaintiffs, citing that the activity was in fact illegal. However, this was overturned by the Circuit Court because the District Court did not respect international comity. What may be a ""monopoly"" on its face in one jurisdiction may not be considered a monopoly in another. This issue of fact becomes only more complicated where a business has substantial international ties.

In terms of Amazon, I am looking at it from a US perspective because it is mainly situated in the US, and looking at it from both the Rule of Reason (current) interpretation and Per Se (pre-""gutted"") interpretation, and it fails to be a monopoly under either interpretation. Vague handwaving about lobbyists and deregulation do not matter because it would not have been illegal conduct when Roosevelt was President, because:

* They aren't price fixing with competitors
* They aren't merging with competitors
* They aren't making market allocation agreements with competitors
* The only household name mergers they've had in the last 10 years is Whole Foods (representing <7% of the grocery market), and MGM which has been in dire straits for a decade and is dwarfed by Sony and Comcast subsidiaries

31,MSCI," I have access to the MSCI report about the ESG score assessment, here are the key points on which Nestle is scored so high:

The fresh water comsumption intensity is 83% less than the sverage in the sector

Corporate governance is good (good accounting practises and executive pay)

Carbon footprint per product is low versus peers

Solid developed water efficiency roadmap for the future.


Now for the things that are scored poorly:

Disputes about water use bottling plants

Too much packaging waste 

Poor supply chain labour standards oversight


The biggest conclusion of the report is that because Nestle is the biggest company it takes the most scruteny. Things go wrong at nestle but less poorly than the peer group.

Personally i would always advice to look whats in an ESG portfolio. Some funds will still have the most sustainable oil and gas company in the portfolio for example. This is a debate around factor exposures and tracking error. If you would purely take out all the sectors with a negative impact you will be heavily overweight in high marketcap growth, thus reducing diversification and increasing volatility. In Europe the checking of ESG will be done through the EU sometime in the near future through the EU Taxonomy.

34,MSCI," ESG is only a brand. 

You need to understand what ESG means on an index-wise basis. Some ESG indices are specific about what they exclude (e.g. weapons, vice products, non-renewable energy, violation of UN global compact, etc.), so in that case Nestlé would make it in. Vanguard / FTSE products often use this kind of exclusion, which means someone like Lockheed Martin or Royal Dutch Shell wouldn't make it through, but Nestlé isn't excluded.  

Others use ESG ratings, often by institutions like MSCI, where you can be utterly terrible at one thing and excellent in another and balance it out. For example, Nestlé gets a laggard rating in 'corporate behaviour' but also 'leader' rating on carbon footprint according to MSCI. Why these are weighted like this and what this really means is not for you and me to decide (MSCI is a private company after all), but MSCI ratings are apparently very important because reasons, and MSCI is the most powerful index provider so if they exclude someone, it's out. This means MSCI's ratings can result in absurdities such as Nestlé being higher than Google, Hello Fresh, and  Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, and because MSCI Indices dominate the market, it's just taken for granted.   

So basically,  

1. Chop down a rainforest  
2. Plant solar panels  
3. Slightly above average ESG rating (leader in clean tech 😏)  
4. ???  
5. Profit!    

------  

In the end, it is important for you to draw a line on what is suitable to you and what is not, and pick an Index that fits your requirements best. For me, personally, I draw the line at fundamental businesses that either should not exist or I don't want to profit from, but businesses who can adapt to be better without changing their fundamental product or service are fine (e.g. you can source cobalt ethically in the future or supply high precision tools to others, but you can't change something about coal or military tanks to make them palatable to me; I simply want nothing to do with them).",vouwrfract,1,/r/stocks/comments/ogtypp/how_exactly_is_nestle_an_esg_company/h4lle6f/,0.057,0.791,0.152,0.991

37,CSR," Primarily because most of Nestle's big crimes are not recent. 

* The baby formula thing happened in the 1970s and was terrible, but that was 50yrs ago

* The child labor in the supply chain for chocolate affected most global chocolate companies and is old news - whether or not they even knew about it is debatable, the supply chains are complex and use a huge number of cocoa producers. There is little insight from these companies into how every organization in the supply chain sources their labor. So again, terrible, but certainly not unique. 

* The ""water is not a human right"" thing was much more recent and they still exploit local water resources for almost free due to lobbying efforts, but what else do you expect from a company that commodifies and sells water? Other bottled water companies do the exact same thing - the CEO of Nestle Waters was just stupid enough to say it out loud. 

In recent years they have poured huge amount of money into CSR initiatives to try to get away from the scandals. These are pretextual and bullshit, but imo that's true of all CSR initiatives. 

I'll get downvoted to hell for this, but Nestle is no more evil or corrupt than the average company. There is no such thing as a ""good"" for-profit, public corporation.

It’s all much more complicated than this. Stock ratings exist but are different than the rating agencies like Moody’s and S&P - which do rate bonds, but that wasn’t the issue either, not directly.

Stock ratings are done by “the street” are and really just guesses by large financial firms. They’ll rate something as a buy (or overweight) or a sell (underweight) based on how they’re predicting future performance. And oftentimes different groups will rate a stock differently.

With Bonds and other fixed income products those are rated by Moody’s and S&P at a much more granular level (AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, etc). With 2008 and Lehman, the issue was not with bonds, but with Mortgage Backed Securities, which is another fixed income product.

MBSs had been considered super duper safe. They pool the risk from hundreds or thousands of mortgages together, and often times were Agency (in this case Fanny and Freddie) backed. However the entire process became too easy. Mortgage originators could SO EASILY sell their mortgages to companies packaging MBSs for risk pooling (and take the risk off their books) that originators we’re giving out mortgages like candy with no consideration for credit risk. MBS packagers we’re paying the ratings agencies to keep these securities rated AAA, which was the major bit of fraud here.

49,IMO," Do you understand how your statements contradict each other?

> I know for a fact that there would be fewer minorities in the IVY league if admissions were strictly merit based...

How are you determining merit? What makes a test score inherently meritocratic? What makes GPA inherently meritocratic? Let me ask you this; let's say I'm an Olympian and I had a 3.5 GPA in HS. I took the hardest class load but because of my Olympic training, I didn't do as well as I'd like in stats. That being said, I'm also an avid researcher and academic and won a Bronze at the IMO (math olympiad.) I scored a 34 on the ACT. 

Now let me give you another kid, who has no ECs and has a 3.6 GPA. He scored a 35, but he just plays video games in his free time. 

I guess in your eyes, we should take the latter because their scores are better? The former is a 3.5/34, the latter is a 3.6/35, it's obvious that a stats based meritocracy would put the latter above. 

Realistically though, *nobody* would suggest taking the latter over the former. The former is a math prodigy, who's also an elite athlete and managed to do so while keeping a fantastic academic record. If so, then you would agree that GPA and stats don't give the full picture and aren't necessarily meritocratic. In which case, the other portions of an application are all inherently subjective. In which case it doesn't make sense to argue that the processes in place today are less meritocratic than before. Given that the Ivies were just white men until the 50's, and then they gradually added women and more and more minorities, to me it's clear that the Ivies are more meritocratic than ever because for the first time in history, they're not just educating wealthy and smart white elites, they're educating smart people of all colours and creeds. 

Unless you're suggesting that there should be fewer minorities, even though places like Harvard are just 12.5% Hispanic/Latino even though 20% of the population is Latino, then you can't make that statement while also purporting that it's a meritocratic process. 

And I like how you went back to college because at least there's an easy thing to refer to as ""meritocracy,"" what about the workplace? 

I work in analytics, what counts as meritocratic there? Should we only hire people who know Python and SQL? In which case we lose a lot of talented people because those are teachable skills (my boss for one of them.) Do we higher people with the highest GPAs? That's kinda a useless metric and a kid with a 4.0 and no social skills is going to be way worse for the team than a 3.0 who has relevant skills and is personable. If my entire team is white and we work for a demographic that is predominately Black, is it not logically obvious that there is value in hiring someone with a perspective that is different from ours? Tell me, how do I implement a truly meritocratic hiring process? How do I weigh people's experiences? Does someone who come from a more prestigious school deserve to be hired on the basis that they are better solely because of that? I don't even have to look at different schools, how do I weigh the value of someone with a 3.9 in data science vs. someone with a 3.8 in electrical engineering and computer science? Or the value of someone with a single major vs. a double major? What makes one decision more meritocratic than the other?

Meritocracy is a fun word because everyone aspires to it but nobody can define it. When you sell meritocracy while having everyone start from a different place, what you do is actually entrench inequality rather than solve it. GPA and ACT aren't meritocratic, they're gameable and it doesn't tell us much. So when you say that the most talented people of each group should be hired, I don't even disagree. And I would argue that that's happening now more than ever, and in order to really see it blossom, the number of white male CEOs would have to be cut down in half. 

What most people mean when they say they want ""meritocracy"" or the ""most talented"" to be hired is that they want a return to the olden days. They might not want the racism, or the sexism, but they want the upper echelons to be populated with old, white men. There is no era in American history that is more meritocratic than today.",doneanddead,1,/r/stocks/comments/ogtypp/how_exactly_is_nestle_an_esg_company/h4muvdd/,0.042,0.821,0.137,0.9975

I'm sure the panel gaps aren't perfect but I've never cared.

I grew up with a dad who worked for Nissan and had a company car which meant brand new cars every 6 months.  My favorite thing to do when he brought them home was to go check out all the new features that they'd added.

I am holding out for an electric car that has a drop in/out battery instead of a fixed one like Tesla so I don't have to worry about long trips and waiting 1-3 hours for it to charge to drive again. If there is an EV maker that creates a universal battery system for all their cars (a big name, GM/Ford/Toyota, etc) they are going to eclipse Tesla in sales overnight.  Nobody wants to wait hours by a charging station to ""refuel"" - if they could drive up to a mechanism or service center that can remove the dead battery with a freshly charged one they are going to turn Tesla into a relic.

I should add I also intend on no longer owning a car after I sell the one I have now for enviromental reasons. This is really the only way to help the planet if you think about it.

85,UK," I've got a 2013 3 series BMW M-sport. Had it from new, and paid it off over 5 years back. 


Comparing it with my friends model 3 (which would be a similar price from new, and the same customer demographic), the interior on the Tesla is a bag of shit, the handling and feel of the car is a bag of shit. 


The torque and low end acceleration is beautiful. The cost per mile is excellent. 


The controls (touch screen) is certainly not to my preference in the Tesla, I'd call it a bag of shit, but some people may like it (But it's also far cheaper and easier to have a touch screen control system than the typical dash in a BMW, so I can see why Tesla have done this with their lack of experience in automotive)


The comfort, driving positive, ergonomics are far superior in the BMW.


I drive a lot of miles, often 200+ in a day. Covered 150k miles in the 3 series without any issue whatsoever - in the UK, that's around £20k in fuel with around 50mpg from the BMW, or £3k per year. The same in the Tesla would be around £5k in electricity, or £625 per year. Massive difference in total cost over the lifetime of the car. (Servicing is honestly super cheap on the BMW, I've always done it myself and it's barely worth factoring in)


The BMW has devalued to a point it owes me nothing, and I will continue to run it into the ground and it becomes unreliable (hopefully 200k+ miles). At which point, I hope BMW do a pure EV 3 series with 300+ miles range, and I'll get that. 


Can't knock the Tesla though. And I'm thankful for them forcing other car manufacturers to up their EV programmes. That said, Tesla are in a precarious position, now that more established executive car manufacturers will be attempting to move from the back seat to the front seat. And I've no doubt BMW will produce a more reliable, superior EV than Tesla will ever be capable of.

BMW have an all EV 3 series in testing, and its expected to arrive in 2022. If the pricing is reasonable, it will be massive competition for Tesla.",Diligent-Motor,8,/r/stocks/comments/ogjp78/what_is_the_actual_quality_of_tesla_cars/h4kob9v/,0.043,0.817,0.14,0.9919

93,EQS," I've recently test driven a Long Range Model 3, Performance Model 3, Mercedes EQS, Audi eTron Q4 and a Polestar 2.

The Teslas are like nothing else. Every EV has the instant torque and lack of gears that makes them much more comfortable to drive, but only the Mercedes and the Polestar came somewhat close in terms of the acceleration (both the speed and the feel of it) and none came close in terms of one pedal driving. Admittedly the Audi was the slowest variant they have available, so I'm sure the faster ones will be on par with the Mercedes and Polestar.

Besides that, the biggest let downs for me were how absolutely terrible the software on the non-Teslas was - seriously felt like controlling a first generation smartphone - and how poorly they're using the advantages of an EV (no frunk and just wasted empty space in between messy wiring and piping instead, wasted space in/below the trunk (Mercedes didn't even have anything below the trunk's cargo hold, just inaccessible empty space or something), drag inducing old fashioned doorhandles, huge mirrors and massive ""grills"" on the front that actually have no function, etc.)",Ehralur,0,/r/stocks/comments/ogjp78/what_is_the_actual_quality_of_tesla_cars/h4l3qm0/,0.135,0.789,0.076,-0.9157

So electricity costing around 20% that of gas, you’ll save $7200 in gas over 5 years. Take out $200/yr in scheduled oil changes too.

So the premium depending on individual commute is more like $8-10k over a Corolla, after 5 years. To lots of people, the smoothness of EV, glass roof, “cool” factor, are worth that premium.

As the engine spins faster it burns more fuel per second making more torque and HP, but low end torque is a weakness for gas engines.

Electric motors on the other hand have a constant torque curve.

137,AAPL, I was just curious what you meant by emergency fund. I guess i believe in both. I own many stocks and actually dont currently have money for a dip. But i always keep plenty of cash for life emergencies. But if i own a bunch of AAPL at 135$ average and then then it tanks down its nice to have money to buy a major correction. Im not saying you should have a large portion of cash lying around but it seems like you can still position yourself well for a crash. Lots of major investment firms keep cash on hand for this very reason.,solagrowa,0,/r/stocks/comments/ogjb4v/buying_stocks_at_all_time_highs/h4jltbf/,0.089,0.771,0.139,0.6808

190,AVO," Just started a smaller position in AVO (Mission Produce) this morning.

Was listening to the All In podcast on my morning run. The guys on the podcast were talking about the drought conditions in Africa, Asia, Western United States and Brazil and how they may be exacerbated even further by climate change, land/agricultural usage, wildfires, deforestation among other things, and how we may be entering a vicious cycle in coming years where water will become more scarce.

Got me thinking.

Water is typically thought of as a common good. Thus, prices of water in most locales don't properly reflect the scarcity of water vs demand, in keeping in line with the laws of price and demand.

I was thinking though, this value HAS to be reflected somewhere, and when they talked about agricultural use, which accounts for 80 percent of consumptive water use around the globe.

What is the most water intensive crop out there? Typically grown in a place where water is scarce and thus should be expensive.

First thought. Almonds. Already expensive. Not a huge crop though, and not seeing huge growth.

Second thought. Avocados.

Huge resource hog. It takes 75 gallons of water to grow one pound of avocados. That's two large Hass avocados. One bathtub full of water. To make matters worse, avocados are cultivated in semi arid, almost desert climates, in other words, they're water hogs in places without a lot of water.

So the economics are as follows. Water becomes scarce. Two things occur. Water prices go up and consumption goes down as conservation measures take place. Avocado producers are left with two options. Pay more for water via irrigation and keep yields in line, or give up yield and reduce supply of avocados. Assuming people keep on eating avocado toast and guac and getting takeout from Chipotle, demand stays the same. Both scenarios result in higher avocado prices.

THIS is where you see the economics of water reflected in pricing. Not in water delivered to households.

On the demand side: AVO has a two pronged strategy that I think is brilliant.

Increase avocado demand in China, which has seen [avocado consumption skyrocket as its reputation as the ""butter fruit"" (it's Chinese name) improves as a health food.](https://youtu.be/H3Mvva7rYzc)

Increase mango demand in Western nations, as US and European mango consumption is miniscule compared to the rest of the world. Mangoes, not apples or citrus, are the most consumed fruit globally. It also has the exact opposite seasonal cultivation cycle from avocados. Mangos are also less water dependent than avocados, giving them another cash crop in times of low avocado supply/high avocado prices.",AngelaQQ,-1,/r/stocks/comments/ogs1rh/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_jul/h4lg5wr/,0.053,0.891,0.056,0.7385

229,GDP," I am not saying we should get against banks but I am saying that Banks aren't as safe as you portray them to be. They carry alot of risks that followed 2008. I agree that banks and the capital market is very intertwined but by investing into banks your are exposing yourself to more risks than necessary (in my opinion)

So the explanation for why economist says 2008 never ended is due to 2 things. The economy did not recover truly since 2008 and the other is Banks and their financial engineering.

What is an economic crisis? Essentially it is a market condition where demand is insanely low and total spending plunges. Which was what happened in the aftermath of 2008. [According to Economist JW Mason ](https://jwmason.org/slackwire/financial-crisis-and-recession/) the total spending did not increase after 2008, after most crisis there is a bump in growth for the economies as they catch up to lost growth and because of pro-business atmosphere and people regaining their income so they have to reacquire things lost in the crsis. Like houses, cars, investment vehicles. But this was not the case, since ww2 to 2007 the US GDP  increased 2.2% [but since 2007, inflation adjusted GDP growth has flattened off](http://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Monetary-Policy-Report-070617-2.pdf). Why so? Because labour force participation in America has been decreasing. People who are employed or looking for employment is decreasing. Why? Because labour force participation is affected by 2 things, education and age. America is getting older faster than the younger generation is getting educated. Older people are less likely to work and less educated people are also less likely to participate in labour. This leads to less investment and productivity. This could go long but sparknotes version: worker wage share going down, worker spend less, businesses all around get less money. 

This is the environment we are in right now, so how do the feds react to this? They lower interest rate to almost 0 in 2008. This is what you do during periods of crisis, this is to give businesses a line of credit so they can bounce back. And this worked... For awhile until rich people started taking on debt to invest in the stock market and engaged in share buybacks, mergers, special dividend payments. All good for shareholders but don't really do much for the economy as a whole. In short its almost like a money laundering scheme to give money from low interest loans to the shareholders. The Feds then saw this as a sign to taper and increase interest. The market reacted very badly to this in 2013. But they pressed on and they were proven right as the market rebounded but this does not change the fact that there was gross misspending of cheap loans and now people cannot pay.

This is where banks come in. In the climate of low interest rate, banks gave out lines of credit for free with no regard for the firm's ability to repay the loans. [In this report by the Feds in 2018](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-201811.pdf) corporations who took alot of loans during the low interest climate were unlikely to pay them back. $2.25 Trillion of debt was considered Investment Grade. Which is 35% of all corporate debt. In another study in 2019 by the IMF, 40% of all corporate debt would be at risk of default (some brilliant foreshadowing by IMF, dramatic). Knowing this many banks started to package corporate debt together in familiar sounding scheme called Collateral Loan Obligation or CLO. Because debt was so cheap and interest was so low, this CLO packaging allowed them to trade debt and get a better return than if they had service the debt. Familiar sounding?  [Look at this ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-23/risky-loans-in-the-clo-market-could-be-trouble-for-u-s-companies) CLO is now a major source of income for Banks and they are incentivised to sell CLO to make money. By middle of 2020, 78% of all leverage debt was term ""cov-lite"" or loans that otherwise would not be approved if not for covid. 

When you collateralize debt together, you are essentially saying that when you group risky debt together, the threat of one defaulting is not as scary or dangerous to the bank servicing the debt. But they had a safety mechanism where if the debtor failed to be above a certain level of credit they would be kicked out. It is estimated 500b of debt will be downgraded from investment grade to junk and kicked out from CLO. This makes people less likely to want to buy CLOs as so many of them have kicked out bad debt indicating that CLOs are bad in general. CLO has dropped from 98.5c a dollar in December to 83.5c a dollar in April. This chokes out more credit from the system. Which makes more debt kicked out from CLOs which makes people less likely to buy CLO which then chokes lines of credit, leading to more debt being kicked out. It's a vicious cycle. With each passing cycle, people are losing their jobs and businesses are shutting down (this is why Small Businesses are struggling to get loans even though Interest Rates are so low now).

As people lose their jobs they reduce their spending in the economy making the first point even worse, people who have jobs are working from home and haven't left the house in awhile and are spending less. Which leads to businesses having less income, which makes businesses not able to finance their loans which get them kicked out of CLOs which choke their line of credit until they go bust. 

Meanwhile everybody that has bought CLOs have seen the value of it drop through 2021. [Moody's estimate that 6.8% of all loans will default this year ](https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_1221409), 20.8% if things get back to 2020 level of lockdown. There is 20.8 Trillion of these kind of debt. And these aren't even in CLOs.


So who is the loser holding all the CLOs and bad debt? Banks, insurance companies and credit rating agencies. Nothing was learnt from 2008. Banks stopped CDOs just to redo it in another industry, and now this is a huge ticking timebomb. The Feds look at this and all they see is that businesses that used to be able to get loans to restart their productions aren't being able to and they buy up all the junk debt that was kicked out of CLOs as a way to mitigate it. This is why QE has been so high and the Feds aren't able to taper it. If banks can't provide credit, then the feds have to do it. 

Fundamentally, the economic environment has not changed since 2008, financial instruments that banks used in 2008 was not changed, rich people used money that was supposed to support their business to line their own pockets. This is why 2008 didn't end.

234,BABA," The worst thing about investing in Chinese companies is the vehicle used to do this.  When you buy a company from another country you are buying an “American depository receipt” or an ADR.  An ADR is a derivative not an actual share with legal rights in your country, and questionable rights in the country of origination.  This means that as a holder of an ADR you have no American legal system protecting you as a shareholder.  This is probably no big deal if you’re investing in countries with a fair legal system, but China….it’s bad.  If Xi passes a law in China that says BABA is now a state run entity - you’re fucked.  You have no recourse.

This is why BABA is cheap.  You’re not only betting on BABA, but you’re betting that Xi doesn’t fuck things up.  Which he has been doing a lot of lately.  He does not seem as adept at managing China as his forebearers were (the fundamental flaw of authoritarian states).

235,JPM," It's probably not the best time to invest in US-listed Chinese stocks. The whole ADR thing might go away, the CCP is undermining Chinese tech giants/unicorns that can challenge its power and America is still furiously pursuing trade war vs China despite its deflationary effects. There is a lot of risk with limited upside, as far as I can tell. In the meantime, Goldman Sachs, JPM & etc are over in China busily creating local business units there, so uber-wealthy clients have access to investing in mainland markets, which means there's no motivation for investment bankers & financiers to weigh in to solve financial products trade war conflicts as their doing so would mainly benefit retail investors whom they don't care about. As things are, the financial products trade war vs US listed Chinese stocks effectively sequesters  access to Chinese growth for super wealthy people, financiers and investment banks who have inroads to mainland China investing via their cronies, while shutting out retail investors and small-outfit professionals.

Maybe if new trade war or treaty developments change some of these risks vs reward in a year or two, things might change. But for now, it looks as if the US trade war hawks and the CCP are of the same mind that they don't care for US listed Chinese stocks and there are few reasons for that to change in the near future.",rhetorical_twix,3,/r/stocks/comments/oguvn8/can_you_still_invest_in_chinese_companies/h4lfm8v/,0.135,0.794,0.072,-0.9428
236,USA," It's still quite an emotional topic it seems. In a nutshell, you're either one of these groups:

1. You think China is bad, USA is the land of the free. Disregard all the regulations and what the US government has done over the past decades to diminish basic human rights. Not open to debate, China is an insult. Also disregard that without China, we'd be buying cellphones at $4K and computers at $7K. Of course, heavy regulations in the US are not the reason why China has become so powerful. You may buy Chinese, but owning the companies you buy products from is beneath you. Don't forget to mention morally questionable events that take place in China for likes and virtue cookies on social media. Very popular take on social media, from both conservatives and liberals. Gets you a lot of likes.
2. You think that there's a reason why VIE and ADRs exist. China needs foreign money to fund their business and growth. It's essential to China's development. The average Chinese invests considerably less in stocks than their US counterparts. The Chinese save a bigger chunk of their money in savings accounts or invest in real estate. So Chinese companies list their stock in the US to be able to raise funds that they wouldn't get in mainland China. The Chinese government launched (in 2020 if I'm not mistaken) a series of policies to encourage people to invest in stocks, but it will take years/decades before they catch up. It might take a real estate crisis in China to get there. Until then, you fail to see how shutting down ADRs would benefit China. In this group you'll find hedge funds, investment banks, more quiet retail long-term investors who don't want to be called names by group number 1, or day-traders who bet on wild daily price movements.
3. You don't really know but you get considerably influenced by group number 1, because they're quite vocal. You may partly agree with both group 1 and 2 to some extent, but peer pressure exercised by group 1 would tend to keep you away from Chinese stocks.
4. You don't necessarily agree with group number 1, and understand group number 2, but you're not willing to take the political risk, or don't like to see your portfolio swing up and down daily, so you don't buy Chinese stocks. You understand that you may miss some lucrative opportunities, but you're okay with it.

Asking Redditors for advice on what is a very emotional topic for most people would indicate that you're part of group number 3.

Which imo is what the future is about. Not individual apps/digital companies, each serving a purpose, but ecosystems where each app is curated by the company (but not necessarily created), where each ecosystem manager will try to lure the consumers by offering the best exclusive apps/services on their ecosystem (which is what Microsoft is trying to do, and, imo, succeeding so far).

My guess is that, at the very least, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft will have the biggest ecosystems and, probably, the most profitable too.

278,CPG," A good P/E ratio varies from sector to sector. Stocks for companies in defensive sectors like consumer packaged goods typically have lower P/E ratios than their counterparts in faster-growing sectors like software. I would look at the stock's P/E ratio relative to its direct competitors and other stocks in the same sector. There are other factors to consider when comparing stocks for similar companies, but it's useful to gauge value relative to companies who generate revenues and profits in similar ways. 

To illustrate my point about sectors, I'd gladly buy a share of Microsoft (MSFT) at a P/E of 30, but I wouldn't buy a share of Procter & Gamble (PG) at a P/E of 30. Both are great stocks in my eyes, but a P/E of 30 on a CPG stock would be too steep for me.",majesticmaven,1,/r/stocks/comments/ogity9/earning_per_share_and_pe/h4jc8wj/,0.011,0.777,0.212,0.9818

At least using earnings and debt: assets ratios at least gives me a sense of what companies hold the potential power to adapt to and dominate future market conditions. 

I'm not confident enough to trade with a short term mindset. For instance, back in March/April is saw ESEA had a massive sell off. So I decided to buy the dip. The short term volatility was killing me, so I sold with a 2% gain. Looking back ay watch list, ESEA gained 130+% from the price I bought it.

287,KO," There is no single way to engage in this - I am not saying don't invest in individual stocks, so I hope it doesn't sound that way.

But the way these funds are more effective than your personal dollar, is that they have the power of collective wealth behind them and actually meet face-to-face with corporations to push them to change specific things.

For example, in the press release Green Century put out on May 21st, they discuss how they met with Home Depot, Lowe's, and other big box garden stores to encourage them to stop using certain pesticides that are linked both to human cancers and apiary colony collapse.

You could find companies that create alternative, organic pesticides and invest $5000 in those and that would be a positive thing for sure, but going to massive multinational corporations and saying 'we have millions invested in you and we have something we'd like you to change if you want us to stay invested' can have a much more immediate and much larger impact, even if they thing is a small victory.

You know, if KO is using 100% virgin aluminum for their cans and you can convince them to change that to 5% recycled - due to their size that would result in a massive difference.

I hope that makes sense. It's basically like the capitalist version of collective bargaining. You can ask for a raise and your boss can say no, but if everyone at your company says, 'We aren't working unless we get a raise' then they often come to table with a better offer.",roundupinthesky,2,/r/stocks/comments/ogzvhy/esg_investing_is_not_bullshit_heres_why/h4m3xma/,0.039,0.793,0.168,0.9902

301,GME," I think the post is bias. Am probably going to be targeted for this post but i don't really care. The issue with Didi is data. Like we all know the political climate at the moment things are very fragile. China doesn't want US regulators snooping into chinese citizens data just like US don't want its people data be analysed. Anyone remember the tiktok saga. Same story. The CCP also mentioned they suggested Didi to delay the IPO and haven't read anything denying this claim. Lets not forget 1st of july is a big event in china the 100th anniversary of the party probably more important for them, than the 4th of july for you Americans and Didi did the ipo on june 30. Also to add on this Didi rushed the ipo unlike the more traditional way taking months of advertising. I feel (speculative) Didi executives knew what was coming to them and just tried to challenge the ccp and it just backfired.

About reciprocity, like most comment on reddit people say that the CCP is evil and did this or that, which i agree with you all but America elite are the same. Just look at GME what we fighting against the global elite boomers. What aboout 2008, i wonder what the chinese thought of corrupt america at the time. Just look wells fargo yesterday scewing their own customers. Am not for CCP or Corporate america they are the same. I don't think Biden wants to play a fair game either in the tech war. When was the last time uncle Sam played it fair and ccp are definitly on the same boat. We swallow as much propaganda as our chinese companions.

Tech crack down is more about inside china. For many years the chinese internet industy has remained unregulated, thus the exponential growth. Now the government is trying to act as the people's savior by limiting the monopoly power. Such as the 996 culture that the tech sector tries to push. Or delivery drivers dying because of over work. Or people being over charged because the algo recognise you earn more. Of course the governmnent dont want big corps to have too much power. The government is trying to increase competition in the country where growth is slowing down.

Most colonies were formed after 1600, and the United States was the first nation whose most distant origins are fully recorded.
