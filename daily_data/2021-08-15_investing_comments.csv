0,IMO," What kind of mentality and personality do you bring to investing?

IMO, disciplined analytical/mathematically intuitive minds that can focus on well defined short term ""bets"" have rhe possibility to do very well with options. Options provide leverage. If your bets are netting positive in a systematic fashion you can make your money grow faster. Alternately some big investors have used for making daring contrarian bets(those bets can be hard to maintain for small investors esp. If market is in a more irrational state, which can be common).

I'm a long term investor, I don't rattle easily, and am reasonably disciplined, but I don't have the numerical bet mindset or time horizon which options investing is best suited for. I've had good luck at riding long term trends and building a diversified portfolio with buys at sensible times- that's been my model for collecting a portfolio of stocks that has modestly outperformed US indices for last 10 yr horizon.

For me, options are not a tool I personally like for two reasons:
1-time horizon is too short for the kinds of bets or predictions I'm comfortable with making. I prefer understanding a business and sticking with good ones. Options are more transactional, on horizons of weeks or months, rather than years.
2-I find the mathematical abstractions of options to be a distraction of complexity which really requires a mind that can systematically consider a universe of option strategies in a coherent way. E.g. do you like games like chess and poker? Are you good at anticipating implications od future moves and anticipating probabilities so you won't likely regret your prior decisions?

On doing it full time ""trading options"" or really any style of actively investing with your own small pool of money as if it was a day job is akin to pursuing modern day alchemy. A recipe for stress, as you are really reliant on pretty consistently outperforming the markets and not making any severe errors, as it's both your nest egg and cash flow. Especially if your strategy goes sideways due to a general shift of the markets.

For me, any kind of investing is best done using supporting cash flow of a day job(until you have a serious nest egg and reserves), or with scale benefits of other people's money. As a private investor, I'd suggest keep working, and experiment with learning options strategies on the side with a limited portion of your portfolio.

Bro you **literally** said that not selling covered calls is “leaving money on the table” and then you spend a whole comment talking about how comparing the two scenarios doesn’t make sense. It’s almost comical, like either you forgot your comment or you’re trolling.

Wtf? Opportunity cost is a core concept of investing, and one you invited discussion on by claiming that anyone not employing that strategy is leaving money on the table.

> Unless you are somehow at every moment at the supremum of all possible portfolio configurations, then you have opportunity cost. 

Nobody is trying to compare with being a perfect investor. Just with the method you claimed leaves money on the table. Just with the exact same thing you’re doing *minus* the calls. Acting like it’s the same thing as comparing to being the perfect investor is ridiculous. 

> I don't see how missing possible profits 1/10 times somehow washes out against taking profit 9/10 times.

Uh….. because… dude the math seems simple? Did you read my comment at all!? It was explained that most market gains come from large upward moves. So if you miss a potential 15% upswing, that could make you actually underperform someone who simply held the stock and never sold calls.

> By that logic, all of my gains this year are a wash because I didn't throw everything into GME at its year low and sell at its peak. 

No, stop being fucking ridiculous. You sold contracts which cap your gains on a stock you already own. And then you said people who don’t do that are leaving money on the table. It’s not even in the same universe as comparing with “what if I bought GME”. 

> Opportunity cost is one of those wishy-washy, sometimes helpful, but definitely very ""soft"" measures (or whatever you would call it.)

As for contracts, ideally you have a broker that will exercise and liquidate your LEAPS to fulfill your short calls being exercised at time of expiration so you are not inadvertently shorting a stock. I'd call whoever you use and verify they will do this for you, being sure to figure out when specifically they would close a position. Some do it after hours, some do so many minutes before close on that Friday. Your other option is to roll your short calls up in date and out in strike before you hit expiration to avoid exercise or becoming in the money. You can also buy your short contracts back.

As for a recommendation, I can't give one on a large company as I am in the middle of moving my money around, and haven't done a ton of research past my long time holds I already have. I will say I wanted exposure to ASTS without holding shares so I bought some LEAPS and am selling calls to lower my cost basis.

46,CD," Ally Bank has also gone down to a .5% interest rate recently, I suspect most 'high yield savings accounts' are about the same. When I opened my account with Ally in 2018 the interest rate was 2% but as the federal reserve lowered rates retail banks followed.

Yeah the interest rate is pretty bad and it's definitely lower than inflation this year but it's still better than the interest rate offered by most local banks which is around .03%.

In short, even if you are losing a small bit of money to inflation it's still the safest place to park money that you might need within a day due to an emergency. Any investments with better interest rates like a Bond/CD tie up your money for a set period of time or an index fund can lose value unexpectedly.

Emergency funds are meant to be easily accessible. Any massive global emergency that tanks the economy is equally likely to affect your own personal life too.

I have made quite a lot and when it does make money or is larger than needed i sell the excess and move it to retirement accounts. All other emergencies get put on CC (i hoard points) and then immediately paid off. Immediate to me is no more than 3 months (general 1 or less).

The point is not to use the credit card as the emergency fund. The point is that a credit card allows you to make a purchase and not have to deal with interest for 30 days.

Those 30 days are used to liquidate or otherwise get access to your emergency fund. Maybe it's a bank account that you don't have online access to.

My EF literally made it so I could continue my savings contributions (ira, brokerage, etc), pay all bills, still enjoy life and never once worry about it. Then the income faucet turned back on and life continued as normal. EF contributions turned back on to rebuild it so we drew down discretionary spending by a small amount for a few months.

Years its up, i pull out any excess and put it to work like any other savings. Years that its down, i just dont worry about it frankly, because if its a true emergency i have CC with ridiculous open ended credit so no matter what it is i can fund it. The idea basically came around after a few years of sitting on emergency funds i wasnt using then calculating the annualized avg return i was missing out on and that decided that. In my world, that emergency stock fund really is there to pay of any debt that pops up that is going to take me more than a couple months to otherwise pay off. I did have some crazy medical bills earlier this year, 6k out of pocket worth. Grabbed what i needed out of hysa to pay off then slowly added back to it to get it where it needed to be.

74,MA," is it impossible to time? I've been saying since over a year ago the correction would come in Sept/Oct of this year. Probably go back to 3200. Yeah it's just a meaningless prediction, but people are talking about it now. But I base it on previous chart patterns over many years that market reverts back to prices at the beginning of the year from year prior. I don't have all the data in front of me, but you can see examples. Like 2016 it returned to Jan 2014 levels. In 2019 it returned to near Jan 2017 levels. 2020 returned to Jan 2017 levels, but that was a bit of a special case. 2018 returned to Jan 2017 levels too. I'm just saying I think we return to Jan 2020 levels. It's really not much of a stretch, since I just pointed out 2016, 2018, 2019, 2020 had major pullbacks. That's only 1 of the previous 5 years that didn't have the pullback. It's pretty easy to see it happening anyway since once the market breaks below the 50 day MA you are pretty much screwed. But the problem now is the market has run up so much that 50 day is almost 13% down from here. So you'll be at 15% loss before you figure out if we are screwed or rebounding. Not pretty. But you should be worried cause currently the 200 MA is 30% down from here.

84,TDF," **TLDR: Desperately trying to avoid fees in a Roth IRA, low income and only able to contribute $25/month. Pursuing a hands-off approach in the form of a target date fund. Account currently at Merrill Edge, considering switching to Fidelity. What is the cheapest and most straightforward option?**

My sister is just starting her retirement savings and can only afford to contribute $25 per month. Her Roth IRA is currently at Merrill Edge and she knows nothing about investing, her $200 balance is sitting in a money market and not invested. I would like her to move that money to a target date fund so she can be as hands-off as possible. She has less than $10k at Bank of America so she doesn't qualify for any type of rewards program or reduced fees with Merrill Edge.

I cannot seem to find any information online about Merrill Edge's target date funds. I know she can buy into Fidelity/Vanguard funds through Merrill, but it seems like it would come with hefty fees. As far as I can tell, every $25 contribution would be eaten up by $6.95-19.95 fees. (If I'm wrong please correct me, I am having a hard time finding and understanding Merrill Edge's fee schedule.)

I use Fidelity for my own Roth IRA and I think she could benefit from Fidelity's 2060 TDF (FDKLX). I considered Vanguard's but there seems to be a $1000 minimum and she does not have that much.

I'm considering advising her to move her IRA from Merrill Edge to Fidelity to avoid fees, but Merrill also charges $50 to close the account, which is 25% of her current savings. 

She just wants to throw her current $200 into a target date fund and add $25 monthly. How can she go about doing this in the most cost-effective way possible?",formalde_heidi,1,/r/investing/comments/p4q2sp/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h92lnbh/,0.068,0.903,0.029,-0.8285

113,GDP," In the legitimate world economy (not drug trade or human trafficking) Afghanistan is a blip on the map, maybe 1/100000 of the world GDP if that.   Having the US military there probably increased their GDP 10x.   Now we are leaving, there will be a big recession.  I was going to recommend burning the poppy fields on the way out to ensure they literally have no economy for another year and then sanctions after that.  You need to be thinking more about unrest in the US and disruption of the US economy as taxes are raised.   Another threat is China expanding it’s world power.

117,DCF," Indeed, beta is different from market cap but starting from Buffet's criticism to beta, that a low price is not a risk for a value investor, my thoughts strayed to

>Modern Market Theory considers a high beta a risk -> the risk consists in a low price -> a low price leads to a low market cap -> low market cap is a risk.

 I was having this train of thoughts while I was trying to consider why is there a *cost of equity* at all for a value investor. 

> I'm using Earnings Yield: *EBIT/(Equity+Interest Bearing Debt)*,  ROIC and DCF for the companies that have a proper EY and ROIC]. So I need to understand *cost of equity*.

If anything, the only cost of equity for a company should be the dividend, not Mr. Market's offers.

That's why I came up with this somehow silly question: because I was wondering if there is really a *cost* for a company if its stock is down in the gutter price-wise. And the low profit in emitting new shares (equity-borrowing) is a pretty compelling argument.

121,AMC," Theaters in general is dying industry and it  has been in decline for a long time. 

With that and covid amc was heavily shorted and for the reason that they were bleeding money. From here you can look it it two ways. 

1. People saw it was heavily shorted and tried a short squeeze similar to GME which  clearly worked. It also allowed AMC to issue shares to cover their debts 

2. People are banking on a strong increase in traffic after covid because people are tired of being cooped up watching movies on their tv.
