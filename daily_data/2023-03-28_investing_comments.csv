1,HOPE," The banks are losing value on long-dated bonds with much lower interest rates.  If they want to sell those bonds, rather than old to maturity, they will take a loss on their investment.

More accurately, a specific type of financial instrument is depreciating due to the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates.  This is by design.

You raise interest rates, you know the unemployment rate will go up, as will defaults.  THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT.  The only way to cool off an economy that is too hot (inflation is too high) is to depress economic activity with some sort of pain.

The banks, upon feeling the pain of interest rate increases (in the SHORT TERM time frame... they will eventually benefit from the higher interest rates... but most of the debt that any bank holds is much older debt at issued at lower rates) are howling about how it's too much, with the HOPE of forcing the Federal Reserve to slow down their fight against inflation.

The tools we have to fight inflation are all DEFLATIONARY tactics.  Deflation is, quite simply, assets losing value.  Of course it hurts.  The tools we have to fight inflation are the metaphorical equivalent of chemotherapy.  Chemotherapy is poison that kills the cancer faster than it kills the patient.  Interest rate increases, and ""liquidity injections running in reverse \[the Federal Reserve selling off portfolio pieces\] are designed to cool off the economy... which is the opposite of what any one person would want to sign up for.

We fucked around and found out.  It's time to take the medicine.

Of course you will see a media blitz screaming about how everything is about to burn to the ground.  Doubt it.  It'll hurt.  It's supposed to.  But the only alternative is to let the inflation / cancer grow and spiral out of control.",TiredOfDebates,1,/r/investing/comments/1241cmg/schwabs_7_trillion_empire_built_on_low_rates_is/je11z29/,0.222,0.682,0.095,-0.9955

4,CD," I've moved all our money market cash to laddered Treasuries and FDIC insured CDs, spread around to different CD issuing banks.  Many 401K plans have a brokerage account option that will let you buy Treasuries and broker CDs.  You can read more here from Fidelity: [Ways to Keep Your Cash Safe](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/safeguarding-your-cash), ""The US government does not offer insurance on any type of mutual fund. Money market mutual funds, like bond and stock mutual funds, are investments, and, as such, are not guaranteed. It is important that investors understand that.""

If you have an account at Schwab and buy broker CDs, the FDIC insurance is from the CD issuing bank, and you can have $250K worth of insurance at each bank. The maturity dates on CDs or bonds guarantees that you get your principal returned upon maturity. Bank deposits also usually have FDIC insurance but most of those deposit accounts have pretty low yields right now compared to CDs and Treasuries.

17,TD," Good point, and thanks for the correction about the 0.45% cash yield. I think it was 0.35% at Schwab subsidiary TD Ameritrade up until recently, but perhaps that has moved to 0.45% as you state.

Your second point about customer cash moving to money market funds but staying at the company fails to address the problem of net interest income being at risk regardless of customer outflow or just shifting to yield instruments. I would say the fact that the company has not experienced outflows prior to the banking crisis this month is a positive sign, however as we  have seen, customers are moving assets quickly to where they feel safe and can also earn a higher yield, so while the company is not yet reporting outflows, does not necessarily mean that they are not at risk in the future given what is happening in the industry.

Edit: TD appears to be still at 0.35% and has not moved to 0.45%",jr1tn,7,/r/investing/comments/1241cmg/schwabs_7_trillion_empire_built_on_low_rates_is/jdxk7yl/,0.1,0.798,0.102,-0.128

They're earning just over 2% right now, but that'll go up too along with the FFR (they have $180B (about 35% of their deposits/payables) in cash/short term investments that would be tied closely to FFR and short term rates, and $78B of their AFS and HTM portfolio (about 25%) will mature within the next 5 years, which they can roll over to higher rates).

Yes, their cost of funds will go up in 2023 and it will likely lead to NIM compression, but it doesn't look as dire or clear cut as you're making it out to be.",makken,2,/r/investing/comments/1241cmg/schwabs_7_trillion_empire_built_on_low_rates_is/je0sy6o/,0.018,0.89,0.093,0.9046
19,VC," What do you mean? Be clear. SVB didnâ€™t/doesnâ€™t give any VC portfolio company anything without collateral, or funding commitments etc. no risk at all, it sounds catchy to say they financed venture capital but thatâ€™s not how it works. 

For fun letâ€™s pick a huge VC firm, maybe named after a massive tree that grows in California. They raise commitments for a new fund, letâ€™s say $1B, they find 20 or so portfolio companies they want to back hoping 2 or three out of 20 will be profitable and the rest will fail.

They give that company enough capital to test their strategy, but only that strict limit (unless they fund later tranches) and if that company fails they move on. The bank and the VC firm donâ€™t risk anything. They know and have always cut off those companies if they have no future and would never backstop them with their bank.",Gsogso123,-1,/r/investing/comments/1241cmg/schwabs_7_trillion_empire_built_on_low_rates_is/jdz1fvm/,0.113,0.765,0.122,0.128
20,CD," That is my understanding from what I've read on Fidelity and elsewhere, ""Because the deposits are obligations of the issuing bank, and not the brokerage firm, FDIC insurance applies....Brokered CDs can also be purchased from different issuing banks allowing you to effectively expand your FDIC protection beyond the $250,000 limit in a single account registration type, such as an Individual account or an IRA."", https://www.fidelity.com/fixed-income-bonds/cds

At Fidelity, when you go to buy a broker CD, the features column will note if it has FDIC insurance. (Most, if not all, do seem to have it, at least at Fidelity).  Besides the yield, I look for FDIC insurance and call protection.

Schwab has SWVXX which is currently at 4.58%. https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/swvxx

I assume Fidelity has a similar money market fund, but that's what their cash management account is anyway. They even call out on the page that I linked that it is not a bank account and not FDIC insured.

None of the places you mentioned are banks, so how are they dealing with it? They *already* have had the issue of having customers purely in money market funds.

24,VC," The deal structure doesn't really matter. VC firms were giving startups money, and startups were putting that money in the bank.

SVB assumed that inflows would remain somewhat steady, so they were comfortable with investing their deposits in long term debt, thinking that their short term reserves and new deposits would be able to cover withdrawals.

In the current market startups are less likely to raise capital, which slowed down the amount of money SVB was receiving. This led to them having to sell some of their longer duration bonds at a loss to meet withdrawal demands.

33,NFLX," this is a very interesting case study. I have consistently invested in NFLX year over year beginning in 2012 with the thought of ""well if a recession hits are you going to cut $12 per month netflix which has A TON of content to entertain you and your family for a very low cost?"" But now with so many streaming services, so much dilution, so many programs/movies being pulled off and basically sitting in a vault for months/years at a time before being added back onto a service it makes me wonder if the industry has now left the door open to be one of the first things cut during a recession.  


Obviously you won't cut all your streaming services if you want a cheap way to entertain yourself but I currently sub to every streaming service (or 80% of them).  If needed would I cut maybe 2-3 of them ?  Idk what the answer is or isn't but I don't think they're all as recession proof as i once though a decade ago.

I think Apple is the least diversified out of all the big companies, and it feels like they're making the same mistakes Microsoft did by trying to center the universe around Windows.

I am deciding between ACCumulating and DIStributing ETF. It is intended to save up for the future but then allow me to have a passive income. Looking at pros/cons of both - would it make sense to start with ACC, considering the dividends will likely be small in the beginning anyway ... and once there is an amount accumulated ""switch"" to DIS? - Does that make sense?

I'm not sure how feasible would such a switch be, so one'd need to sell (possibly all) the ACC shares, receive the money to their account, then use that huge some of money to buy a large amount of DIS shares? I assume there might be some fees and taxations involved, not sure how much ... Or is there another more direct way?

Any reason why I shouldn't just move a chunk of money from the 3.75% HYSA to the 4.75% No-Penalty CD and let it sit there instead? If I can withdraw it anytime (after 6 days) it seems like a no-brainer.

I really don't understand how anyone that wants an actual retirement account would even consider using Robinhood for a long term retirement account.

Robinhood doesn't offer access to actual products geared at retirement accounts like target-date mutual funds, fixed income products, bonds, or treasuries.

FFS - Robinhood don't even offer money market funds.

Their accounts are limited to ETFs and equities only so retirement accounts can only simulate fixed income access via ETFs.

And for sophisticated investors who do things like cash secured puts in IRAs - RH accounts are incredibly inefficient because they don't support cash equivalent collateral. So that 1% match is useless when rates are high.

I presume that they have effectively determined that the cost of customer acquisition coupled with the vast amount of free press and social media coverage will cover the 1% match.

It's the same tactic that Robinhood used with their bank sweep program.

I personally think that the 1% match can be a great idea. And it's a neat way to return cost of customer acquisition expenses back to customers.
