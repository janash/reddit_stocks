9,GME," Friendly PSA:

Because of End of Quarter, today WILL be a bloodbath, in possibly either direction, and likely not just GME.

Be prepared to stomach anything, good or bad, at any moment.

Godspeed apes, see you on the other side.

&#x200B;

Edit:

Im glad this didn't go as crazy as it could have. If there was a day to go hard today was one, with likely re-balancing of portfolios happening to hopefully reflect end of quarter trends, data, and announcements after today's close. So the not so severe day speaks to how careful the short side is forced to be. Another piece of their hand is shown.

GME now officially prints +1000% from the $15 January print to this $189. This doesn't guarantee people and institutions piling in and re-balancing to buy GME, but it certainly bodes more confidence.

Guys. I do not think any of these hedge funds are anywhere close to being out of the woods yet. They have basically ‚Äúmortgaged‚Äù their shorts for later in the year. Meaning yes they have paid millions if not billions in premiums because the pain of actually having to get the short called would be unbearable to them. But at some point in time they will have to call all their shorts because mortgaging the future will become too expensive. Most likely bailed out or go chapter 5 or 11 depending on what they want to do. Once a company is shorted with a large amount of synthetic stocks and it gets called out for an extended period of time (first time in the history of the world) with too much interest in buying...

Now the part that makes all of this even more sweet is THEY CANNOT GET OUT OF THE POSITION REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEY DO IF WE HOLD.

They will need to buy our shares and at that point in time we will deem what the price is. The math is simple as long as you hodl....

:::Original post:::

Guys. I do not think any of these hedge funds are anywhere close to being out of the woods yet. They have basically ‚Äúmortgaged‚Äù their shorts for later in the year. Meaning yes they have paid millions if not billions in premiums because the pain of actually having to get the short called would be unbearable to them. But at some point in time they will have to call all their shorts because mortgaging the future will become too expensive. Most likely bailed out or go chapter 5 or 11 depending on what they want to do. Once a company is shorted with a large amount of synthetic stocks and it gets called out for an extended period of time (first time in the history of the world) with too much interest in buying...

Now the part that makes all of this even more sweet is THEY CANNOT GET OUT OF THE POSITION REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEY DO IF WE HOLD.

They will need to buy our shares and at that point in time we will deem what the price is. The math is simple as long as you hodl....

I would like to hear everybodies opinion on this matter the way I see it.

I am going to eat a crayon and remember to tell you all this is not financial advice.

I want you to know that I am just like you but a little different. I have a profit on GME and I plan on selling when I can maximize the profits. Unlike you, I see long term value in GME and know betting against the retards holding is a bad bet. Im also different from you in the fact that I've been poor and don't have to worry if I'm able to buy my 2nd yacht or give up one of my 5 homes. You might think that I will eventually give in at a low price but that won't happen. Anyway, while you're trying to jack off to poors, I hope you won't be able to get it up knowing that your indeed fucked. Thank you for you time.

He does both. His contracts for the April 16 $12c are half as big as they were earlier this year.

IMO I would wager a guess that the reason why you don‚Äôt see any purchases from him in the last month is because he intends to exercise the remaining 500 contracts. And that might be his last purchase until it is post squeeze.

He did the work. He invested when others didn‚Äôt see it. He stayed patient and picked up some nice profits along the way.

It‚Äôs up to us now to see this across the finish line.

207,GME," Look up options. He is saying that he wants to be able to buy 100 shares of GME for $12 a share, for each contract. The $20 per contract he paid is for locking in that commitment.

208,GME," It's a contract.  He paid someone $20 for a contract that at any time of his choosing, the person selling him the contract is obligated and required to sell him 100 shares of GME for $12 a share.  The contract expires on April 16th, 2021.  The value of that contract is $0 at any time GME share price was below $12.  If it remained below $12 the entire length of the contracts term, the seller made the profit of $20 per share and walks away with the money.

However instead the price skyrocketed as you know.  So at any point, DFV can exercise those 500 contracts that he paid $10,000 for, and force the seller to sell him 50,000 shares of GME for a total of $600,000.

DFV now owns 50,000 shares of $GME, with a current fair market value of ~$9,500,000 at the time of this screen shot.

You can also just sell the contract itself to someone else.  They will instead just directly pay you the difference between the ""strike price"" of the contract ($12/share) times the current stock price (~$192/share at the time of the screenshot) and you just walk away with the cash instead of the shares to sell, without having to come up with the $600,000 cash to buy the shares.

355,GME," I believe in the stock (GME company as a whole). Transition to mostly online model is the way. However, I believe the company will have success in its hybrid approach (brick and mortar being around 20-30% of the revenue). Physical locations can be a wonderful opportunity to build gaming hubs where gamers can interact physically. We know that the virtual/augmented reality field is expanding, and I believe that the company‚Äôs partnership with Microsoft will not only bring efficiency in the update retail technology, but may have huge potential for providing unique meet-up destinations where gamers (as well as other interested users) can experience newly developed VR/AR games, experiences, implementations.
I may be off in what physical spaces may provide, but I would not want to see the physical spaces close. They won‚Äôt be as much store (even though you will be able to make purchases there as well), but more of experience-driven centers. Plus, after this whole pandemic here even more under control, I sure as heck would love to go to a GameStop hub, have a beer and snacks, meet up with friends and enjoy some new digital gaming experience.

368,GME," At some point during a turnaround a shitty company becomes a company worth buying. Apple in the first couple years after Jobs went back. It takes time to see the impacts.

The question about value is definitely answered by ‚Äúwhat people are willing to pay for it‚Äù. Sometimes that number is lower than fundamentals suggest  and sometimes it is higher.

For example when DFV was pounding the table that GME was not fundamentally valued correctly, GME was ‚Äúworth‚Äù (being traded at) $4 / share. Was this pricing by the market accurate? Was it accurate to the future? Was it accurate to the fundamentals?

Somewhere between fundamentals and make-believe moon-land exists a realm where enough people believe in a story that it becomes real.

The make believe land is proven to be a fantasy when sales and profits regularly  don‚Äôt meet expectations. The DFV land is proven when sales and profits regularly exceed expectations.

Apple was severely fundamentally over valued during multiple extended periods during the 2000-today run up. Or was it?

I eat crayons, but in my head Ryan Cohen et al have a story in progress and GME fundamentals could catch up to the current price fairly easily. Many people may not think so. This is fine.

392,HUGE," I used to work in animal care and you are severely underestimating the spending power of lonely old people who have 30 cats and 10 dogs because their grandkids dont come visit them

It's an industry that's been absolutely booming, especially since younger generations seem to be having kids less and treating pets like children. Which means spending LOTS of money on fancy specialty toys, clothes and other novelty accessories, specialty treats, raw whole diets that cost more a month than you or I probably spend on groceries, etc etc

and edit to add: I feel that while yes Chewy and Gamestop are both companies that operate their own marketplaces within a specific industry, unless Gamestop can REALLY change their game plan and step up, Chewy will be on top. There are a ton of gamers as well as pet owners, but honestly Gamestop just isnt where most people buy their games or consoles anymore. But with Chewy, they were easily the biggest name in the online pet supply game, even to the extent most vets Ive worked with had some kind of professional partnership or promotion with them. That's HUGE, especially when it comes to them getting the prescription food orders. And they are owned by PetSmart now, and they are one of the two biggest retail pet chains in the country. Plus with the pandemic people are adopting pets more than ever, which means buying more pet supplies than ever

394,RH," >just too easy buying the games straight off the respected console

And also too expensive, the leasing part is nice but in the end not everyone has the money to buy everything new off the shelves, GameStop is still biggest in second hand and for the people for whom games and their new prices are still a luxury to afford there is an ongoing and huge market for second hand. You just can't sell a download linked to your account and creditcard neither take it to use at someone else's console.

I believe GameStop with their monopoly with big vendors in gaming industry for being only seller of certain titles, with their experienced team of people who want to work at GameStop and with RH and transition into digital market (like recent introduced [2 hour delivery](https://i.redd.it/f4g99q2zn9q61.jpg)) have great potential to increase their current market cap even above current price",Obvious_Equivalent_1,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mgqjlt/chewy_chwy_exceeds_2020_fiscal_and_q4_predictions/gswj73z/,0.0,0.81,0.19,0.9828

451,PLTR," I mean, you are missing the part where if PLTR crashes to 10 dollars and you sold a put at 20 dollars, you have to buy those shares at 20 instead of 10 which is a 100% increase in price and a huge loss. And the person to whom you sold the contract makes a shit ton of money of course.

The wheel is a good strategy, but you have to understand that there is risk. If somebody bought your contract is because they think they can make a lot of money like this at your expense, it‚Äôs not because they are dumb (well, there are actually very dumb people buying options so that may not be true, but you get what I mean lol)",DantehSparda,14,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mgxfim/have_5000_shares_of_pltr_at_239_cost_basis_about/gswc573/,0.149,0.777,0.075,-0.9

455,DM," Mhmm I'll try to explain. If you BUY a PUT, yu can sell at tht determined strike price. If you write, or SELL a PUT, as the writer of the contract, you have to buy the shares since the other person is the one selling them. Does that make sense?. Just like if you buy a call and exercise,  you are buying the shares from someone who wrote the call, in which case that someone is selling the shares to you who exercised. 

In this case, if I have $2,200 in my account, I can write a PUT and SELL it to you for premium. If pltr goes to $20 at expiration date, you can sell me 100 shares at $22 and I have to pay the $2,200 for them, even though at tht time it's only worth $2,000. So you, who bought my put, just got $200 profit. 
If PLTR is $23 at expiration, I still get to keep your premium and I don't have to buy at $22. And you lost out on what u paid for the contract. 

>I believe what you're saying is, because he holds the shares, he can sell a put option to another ape

**becuase he holds the cash**

If you already have 100 shares, than you can write a covered call against your shares and sell to someone else. If personA wrote a $25 call expiring tmm to personB, and tmm it closes at $26, personA would have to sell the 100 shares for $25each to personB.

The market makers and hedge funds who are trying to remain delta neutral when your friends gamma squeeze on February 24th and March 25th are buying the dip.

 DJ Goldman, Morgan Limit Losses With Fast Sale of Archegos Assets 7:53 PM ET 3/29/21 | Dow Jones  By Maureen Farrell, Margot Patrick and Juliet Chung    
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley  were quick to move large blocks of assets before other large banks that  traded with Archegos Capital Management, as the scale of the hedge  fund's losses became apparent, according to people with knowledge of the  transactions. The strategy helped limit the U.S. firms' losses in last  week's epic stock liquidation, they said.   
 

Losses at Archegos, run by former Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang,  have triggered the liquidation in excess of $30 billion in value. Banks  were continuing to sell blocks of stocks linked to Archegos Monday,  traders said.   
 

""This is a challenging time for the family office of Archegos  Capital Management, our partners and employees. All plans are being  discussed as Mr. Hwang and the team determine the best path forward,"" a  company spokeswoman said in a statement Monday evening.   
 

Archegos took big, concentrated positions in companies and held  some positions in a mix of stock and swaps. Swaps are a common  arrangement in which a trader gets access to the returns generated by a  portfolio of shares or other assets in exchange for a fee.   
 

Losses threatened to spill over into the so-called prime brokerage  businesses that have been handling the firm's trading. The group of  large Wall Street banks includes Goldman, Morgan, Credit Suisse Group AG, Nomura Holdings Inc., UBS Group AG and Deutsche Bank AG, said people familiar with the firm's trading.   
 

On Thursday, Archegos asked banks handling its business to meet to  hash out a strategy to liquidate its holdings, said a person familiar  with the meeting. The firm's largest positions had turned sharply  negative following a long run-up. A proposal emerged for all the banks  to hold off on large trades and to talk further over the weekend, but  the call ended without any agreement.   
 

On Friday morning, banks started seizing Archegos' stock, and  Goldman Sachs started selling in size. It quickly became clear there  would be little to no coordination among the banks.   
 

Goldman and Morgan each raced to liquidate positions tied to Archegos.   
 

The discussion among so-called prime brokerages was extremely  unusual and has happened only a handful of times in recent memory, in  some cases averting liquidations.   
 

The decision to sell early helped insulate Goldman from losses that  have hit other banks. Goldman expects the results of the Archegos  account to be ""immaterial"" to its financial results for the first  quarter ending this week, according to a person familiar with the  matter.   
 

Morgan Stanley sold 45 million shares of ViacomCBS Inc.  Sunday night, marketing the blocks to a select number of clients and  responding to big investors who called to ask about additional blocks of  stock the bank might be unloading, said traders.   
 

Banks on Monday sold blocks of stocks worth several billion dollars  in companies that also saw selling late last week. They included blocks  of shares in Discovery Inc., U.S.-listed Chinese tutoring company GSX Techedu Inc., Chinese e-commerce platform Vipshop Holdings Ltd. and ViacomCBS, again.   
 

Wells Fargo, which on Monday sold blocks of stock, including in  ViacomCBS and GSX, also told clients Monday it had finished liquidating  its exposure.   
 

Credit Suisse and Nomura weren't major sellers Friday, traders said.   
 

Credit Suisse said Monday it was too early to quantify the exact  impact it faced, but that it could be ""highly significant and material""  to its results for the first quarter, which ends this month. Nomura said  it was owed about $2 billion by a U.S. client. A person familiar with  the matter said the trades in question were related to Archegos.   
 

Shares in Nomura fell 16%, a record single-day drop. Credit  Suisse's U.S.-listed shares tumbled 11.5%, the biggest decline in a  year. In New York on Monday, Goldman fell 0.5% and Morgan fell 2.6% on a  day when the Dow Industrials rose 98 points and the S&P 500  declined modestly.   
 

The Archegos episode is the latest in a long history of blowups to  reveal that while Wall Street banks bill themselves as second to none in  gathering information relevant to investing, they often struggle to  know what is going on next door. That shortfall is germane to the  Archegos liquidation because it seems clear that the banks didn't  realize until too late that they were holding similar positions, with  malign implications for efforts to keep markets in those shares from  falling further.   
 

""You can have a suspicion that maybe this person is doing this  trade with a bunch of other people,"" said Jay Dweck, a former trading  and risk-management executive at Goldman and Morgan Stanley and now consults for banks and hedge funds. ""But no one knows the aggregate.""   
 

The steep losses at Archegos come as a council of top U.S.  regulators known as the Financial Stability Oversight Council is already  scheduled to meet on Wednesday to discuss hedge-fund activity during  the pandemic-triggered crisis. The meeting is the first for the risk  council during the Biden administration, which has pledged to scrutinize  financial weaknesses revealed by the pandemic-triggered market tumult  from March 2020. The council is made up of the heads of the Treasury  Department, Fed and other agencies.   
 

Mr. Dweck, the consultant, pointed to a case that many on Wall  Street are hearing echoes of this week: Long-Term Capital Management, a  massive hedge fund that blew up in 1998. Firms learned the full extent  of the hedge fund's problems only when government officials summoned  them to Long-Term's offices to pore over its records, he said.   
 

""The upshot is, you're going to have stuff like this happen,"" Mr. Dweck said.

On Friday morning, banks started seizing Archegos' stock, and  Goldman Sachs started selling in size. It quickly became clear there  would be little to no coordination among the banks.   
 

Goldman and Morgan each raced to liquidate positions tied to Archegos.   
 

The discussion among so-called prime brokerages was extremely  unusual and has happened only a handful of times in recent memory, in  some cases averting liquidations.   
 

The decision to sell early helped insulate Goldman from losses that  have hit other banks. Goldman expects the results of the Archegos  account to be ""immaterial"" to its financial results for the first  quarter ending this week, according to a person familiar with the  matter.   
 

Morgan Stanley sold 45 million shares of ViacomCBS Inc.  Sunday night, marketing the blocks to a select number of clients and  responding to big investors who called to ask about additional blocks of  stock the bank might be unloading, said traders.   
 

Banks on Monday sold blocks of stocks worth several billion dollars  in companies that also saw selling late last week. They included blocks  of shares in Discovery Inc., U.S.-listed Chinese tutoring company GSX Techedu Inc., Chinese e-commerce platform Vipshop Holdings Ltd. and ViacomCBS, again.   
 

Wells Fargo, which on Monday sold blocks of stock, including in  ViacomCBS and GSX, also told clients Monday it had finished liquidating  its exposure.   
 

Credit Suisse and Nomura weren't major sellers Friday, traders said.   
 

Credit Suisse said Monday it was too early to quantify the exact  impact it faced, but that it could be ""highly significant and material""  to its results for the first quarter, which ends this month. Nomura said  it was owed about $2 billion by a U.S. client. A person familiar with  the matter said the trades in question were related to Archegos.   
 

Shares in Nomura fell 16%, a record single-day drop. Credit  Suisse's U.S.-listed shares tumbled 11.5%, the biggest decline in a  year. In New York on Monday, Goldman fell 0.5% and Morgan fell 2.6% on a  day when the Dow Industrials rose 98 points and the S&P 500  declined modestly.   
 

The Archegos episode is the latest in a long history of blowups to  reveal that while Wall Street banks bill themselves as second to none in  gathering information relevant to investing, they often struggle to  know what is going on next door. That shortfall is germane to the  Archegos liquidation because it seems clear that the banks didn't  realize until too late that they were holding similar positions, with  malign implications for efforts to keep markets in those shares from  falling further.   
 

""You can have a suspicion that maybe this person is doing this  trade with a bunch of other people,"" said Jay Dweck, a former trading  and risk-management executive at Goldman and Morgan Stanley and now consults for banks and hedge funds. ""But no one knows the aggregate.""   
 

The steep losses at Archegos come as a council of top U.S.  regulators known as the Financial Stability Oversight Council is already  scheduled to meet on Wednesday to discuss hedge-fund activity during  the pandemic-triggered crisis. The meeting is the first for the risk  council during the Biden administration, which has pledged to scrutinize  financial weaknesses revealed by the pandemic-triggered market tumult  from March 2020. The council is made up of the heads of the Treasury  Department, Fed and other agencies.   
 

Mr. Dweck, the consultant, pointed to a case that many on Wall  Street are hearing echoes of this week: Long-Term Capital Management, a  massive hedge fund that blew up in 1998. Firms learned the full extent  of the hedge fund's problems only when government officials summoned  them to Long-Term's offices to pore over its records, he said.   
 

""The upshot is, you're going to have stuff like this happen,"" Mr. Dweck said.

 DJ Goldman, Morgan Limit Losses With Fast Sale of Archegos Assets 7:53 PM ET 3/29/21 | Dow Jones  By Maureen Farrell, Margot Patrick and Juliet Chung    
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley  were quick to move large blocks of assets before other large banks that  traded with Archegos Capital Management, as the scale of the hedge  fund's losses became apparent, according to people with knowledge of the  transactions. The strategy helped limit the U.S. firms' losses in last  week's epic stock liquidation, they said.   
 

Losses at Archegos, run by former Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang,  have triggered the liquidation in excess of $30 billion in value. Banks  were continuing to sell blocks of stocks linked to Archegos Monday,  traders said.   
 

""This is a challenging time for the family office of Archegos  Capital Management, our partners and employees. All plans are being  discussed as Mr. Hwang and the team determine the best path forward,"" a  company spokeswoman said in a statement Monday evening.   
 

Archegos took big, concentrated positions in companies and held  some positions in a mix of stock and swaps. Swaps are a common  arrangement in which a trader gets access to the returns generated by a  portfolio of shares or other assets in exchange for a fee.   
 

Losses threatened to spill over into the so-called prime brokerage  businesses that have been handling the firm's trading. The group of  large Wall Street banks includes Goldman, Morgan, Credit Suisse Group AG, Nomura Holdings Inc., UBS Group AG and Deutsche Bank AG, said people familiar with the firm's trading.   
 

On Thursday, Archegos asked banks handling its business to meet to  hash out a strategy to liquidate its holdings, said a person familiar  with the meeting. The firm's largest positions had turned sharply  negative following a long run-up. A proposal emerged for all the banks  to hold off on large trades and to talk further over the weekend, but  the call ended without any agreement.

562,DISCA," Well in general different classes of the same stock grow and shrink at the same rates.  Look at GOOG and GOOGL for example.  What happened today with DISCB is a total freak anomaly situation that could just as easily have happened to DISCA or DISCK....it was just dumb luck that DISCB happened to have a short squeeze.

Recognizing that they would typically grow or shrink at the same rates, the reason you would go for the cheaper stock class is because you're getting more value for your money in the event of a dividend or a buy-out.

Edit- like say you sell 1 contract of something and the premium is $1 a share. When you write a covered call and it goes through, you will have $100 added to your account that you can use for whatever you want if you wanna buy shares with it or whatever.

1161,TV," From your article:

But the day after the interview, Psaki said something different. A reporter asked for a definition of anybody: ‚ÄúTo clarify, did he mean individuals or households? Because it wasn‚Äôt very clear.‚Äù
‚ÄúFamilies,‚Äù Psaki replied.
This response was puzzling, to say the least. Her response raised the possibility that individuals making less than $400,000 would face higher taxes.

But at another point, Yellen also referred to families. ‚ÄúPresident Biden has stated that he will not ask families making under $400,000 per year to pay more in taxes,‚Äù Yellen wrote.

Meanwhile, Heather Boushey, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, sidestepped the question in a recent interview with Bloomberg TV about the level of income that would affect individuals. ‚ÄúAll the details are still to be worked out,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis is an ongoing conversation, so I can‚Äôt speak to specifics at this point.‚Äù",ducknibble,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mgxtqv/tomorrow_bidens_infrastructure_plan_i_was/gswotx6/,0.01,0.99,0.0,-0.1027

1194,RKT," There are multiple points that stick out on RKT. The first is the CEO, Jay Farner. He is a driven and out spoken CEO who truly cares about his company. He has publicly warned against anyone who is taking a short position against RKT. Many other reason why I like him, but that is mainly opinions so I will leave it up to you whether you agree with me or not. 

Second, and more importantly is the diversification of RKT as a company. They have been buying stakes in app development companies and actively developing better platforms for subsidiary companies of RKT to use in both the home mortgage and car loan markets. This is why a lot of people are make the arguments how RKT is on the way to be classifieds a Fin Tech company. They are actively try to develop an app to directly compete with the app platform Zillow (another plus). This would allow RKT to have a stake in the entire process of buying a home (searching/research, acquiring a loan, purchasing and closing). 

Thirdly, RKT has announced and gotten approved a 1 billion dollar share buy back last Nov (which has not taken place yet). This would decrease the share float and could trigger a short squeeze If there is a large enough percentage of the float shorted (haven‚Äôt checked the most recent numbers). 

Finally, RKT‚Äôs have been blowing earning out of the water. Interest rate will most likely remain low and the most active time for home to be bought and sold is during the spring and summer months, which will most likely increase earning evening more for the Q1. 

These are a few of the reasons why I am buy RKT for the long terms I also like the stock so that too... hope this helps!",90bills,31,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mgsdex/doubling_down_on_rkt_when_it_was_on_sale_today/gsvfeir/,0.03,0.798,0.172,0.9932
1195,IMO," Its a modified YOLO.  Often times I've seen bio-tech stocks spike then drop back to their pre spike price.  Then, afterwards there will be another spike, as institutions get into it.  Or, nothing, and the stock will continue the downtrend from the spike.    


RKT has shown buying pressure supporting the pre-spike gap of around 22.50 +- 50c.  IMO, assuming no Covid-type risk-off market, the downside is a low of \~18.  The upside is a squeeze above $40-45.  


Ultimately, the play is against rising yields and the number of refis.  If rates continue to rise, despite the feds push for lower rates, RKT will see less refis and will drop in price, relative to it's revenues.  If rates drop, due to either fed reserve yield control curve or just the market rising to ATH's again, the price of RKT should rise.  


Again, IMO, betting on RKT is betting that TLT (and other bond funds) will rise in price, due to either YCC (yield control curve) by the fed, or by the natural function of stocks always going up, and bond yields will continue to decline.

1226,AMC," Problem is that amc was losing money before covid, and that's because it's biggest supplier, Disney, is now it's biggest competitor. I see that as being a huge problem for it going forward, and exactly why I see covid creating a k shaped recovery.

Some stocks recover, while covid actually seems to spur the further decline of already failing businesses, and maybe even spur the development of new stocks as well.

In this case, AMC went from losing $150 million a year to losing $4.5 billion in 2020. Not only that, but look at what AMC did during this time.

They fired all of their best employees - ones who were keeping them competitive on a product enjoyment basis - and gave their executives massive bonuses for supposed jobs well done.

All while losing almost $5 billion dollars.

Now, if those executives demanded they get little or no pay, then I'd be singing a much different tune here. It would've been a respectable move and showed a dedication to making it work.

But as it stands, this was a resource grab, one that allows the executives to walk away at huge gains during times that are otherwise a gasoline fueled dumpster fire.

If the CEO was a captain at sea, this would be equivalent to jumping ship with all the valuables after tying up all their best shipmates to the sinking ship.

The company was simultaneously paying off debt as well keeping things operational. The stock price started its decline at q1 of 2017. Until that point it was on a steady uptrend. The 2016 year was when they spent $2.3B to acquire Carmike and Odeon. Then also from 2017 to 2019 they spent $2B to $3B to improve infrastructure and quality of their theaters.

Im bullish but frusterated. Every piece of good news drops us more. 

We need blackberry to be hacked by a 4 year old with an abacus then announce their pivot to manufacturing bowling pins in order to have a green run. 

Im ($4700) in the hole with over 500 shares. Multiple positions on it. 
It already takes up over 30% of my portfolio. And boy is this dip looking tasty . 

EOY target realistic $12-15 

EOY Target  to make me happy dance. $20+

EOY Target for me to get a BB tattoo. $75+

Disclosure: im a novice, who spent most of my life savings based on what memes made me laugh the most.

I've been holding Crispr since IPO along with Intellia, and Editas. I have a background in molecular biology, and can confirm the crispr is indeed revolutionary tech. What typically gets left out of DD posts is the [ongoing patent battle for who owns crispr](https://mk0labiotecheugl43g7.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/CRISPR-patent-licensing.jpg). Each company lists this as one of their biggest risks in their 10-K filings, and there business models rely on licensing as one of their major anticipated revenue streams. IMO I think Editas has one of the best chances since they have the an academic ""dream team"", and there has been a decent amount of insider buying as of late.

I'm personally waiting for Caribou to IPO since they'll have the rights to crispr in non-humans. I think there is more money to be made in biotech outside of just medicine such as bioengineering, agriculture, and other applications. Yes, medicine makes bigly money, but it's a very long process for approval that is not guaranteed.I also have a strong bias towards biotech. 

Crispr as a technology is a huge deal so my advice is to buy a little of all 3 claiming the patent. As a sitting play I think it's great. I see this as a similar situation as buying a share of every tech IPO in the 80's, and sitting on it. The gains from the winner(s) will dwarf the losses. That $20 in Apple would be worth $50k today.

Basically two patents were filed for crispr in gene editing around the same time. But, the founder of NTLA used it in eukaryotic cells (basically anything not bacteria), and filed a patent for it.

Now that conference call was catastrophic. They could have made the exact same strategic choices but present them with a better light.

+ positioning for global expansion
+ eliminate IP leakage and low margin contract engineering 
+ Domestic market appetite is high
+ confidence behind skateboard engineering, capable/validated to meet demand and efficiently iterate with tophats
+ study leadership hires. Industry vets being on boarded

Neutral

+|- No hype approach. Announcements to arrive with signed contracts

Negatives
- investor relations non apologetic, no plan to fix
- lots of weak leadership language, not confidence inspiring that he‚Äôll be able to successfully rally employees to deliver on his vision

1.  Shorting a company on moral grounds sounds risky af.  I wouldn't, but that's your call.
2. Comparing anything to pre-covid levels means nothing.  Almost every index is well above pre-covid levels and we know the economy isn't as strong as it was before.  Some of that is just more money in the market.  
3. You haven't really laid out what, if any improvements were done during Covid.  Many of the entertainment companies took the extended time being down to improve their facilities.  The one thing they normally don't have to do major rehabs is time.  They had it during Covid.  Casinos are a good example.  Many of them sunk huge money into upgrades during Covid.  If SeaWorld did the same they could have big numbers soon.
4. We still don't know how to gauge what consumer demand will be like this summer.  It's anecdotal, but the wife and I have hopped on a plane on a whim a couple of times already this year just to go somewhere.  Nothing planned, but we spent money when we got there.",chiefoogabooga,12,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mh6rkc/free_the_whale_a_brief_wsb_history_lesson_and_why/gsx1g9m/,0.034,0.837,0.129,0.9604

1664,FOR," 1. The moral part is only the start, I‚Äôve been clear that this stock is not worth $50 right now based on when they are projecting to get back to normal, I‚Äôm not even sure this stock should be 50 if they were open the entire time

2. Comparing to pre-covid levels is important, gives context to growth prospects before pandemic, what investors were valuing it at and yes there is more money in the market now but that still can‚Äôt justify a massive run-up like this in two months. There is still wayyyyy too much uncertainty about the pandemic/end of 2021 for this to be priced like they already re-opened. 

3. I don‚Äôt think there were any major improvements made that will cause a massive increase in revenue/attendance after reopening, the only thing I can say is that they have done a pretty good job of losing the minimum and staying afloat. 

4. Agreed that consumer demand will be tough to gauge but regardless, unless there is an extremely large increase in attendance (I‚Äôm talking 20% more attendance than pre-covid levels), I don‚Äôt think this valuation can be justified right now. And keep in mind SeaWorld is not projecting revenue to be at pre-covid levels until 2022 FOR NOW.",BoldOwl11,12,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mh6rkc/free_the_whale_a_brief_wsb_history_lesson_and_why/gsx3ysm/,0.054,0.777,0.169,0.9777

For those who doubt. Check the '07 market where a flooded mine caused a full blown bull market sending the worse U stock 22x. This setup is so much greater. We have increased demand, less supply, fewer long term contracts, carry trades instead of LT who scooped up all supply after Fukushima in '11, now that's not much left. We got mining companies buying their own product from the spot market so there's nothing left for utilities. Mines are closed, like 8 of the 10 largest and won't start producing untill 40-55 $/lb.  

I'm 90% uranium stocks atm so heavily biased, it's a long term play at least 2/3 years to see the real fireworks. Do your own DD and check some of Mike Alkin interviews.

I will concede PRLB is a longer term play in the sense that small machine shops will be able to compete, but I think their time is limited to a few years. If inflation really picks up this year, and we're already seeing minimum wage get ticked up (CA just went to 14 from 12), the rising cost of doing things at small machine shops will contribute to exponential increase in demand from PRLB",robbinhood69,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mh8oy2/69_calls_110k_on_prlb_protolabs_part_1/gsxlqr6/,0.064,0.878,0.058,-0.17
