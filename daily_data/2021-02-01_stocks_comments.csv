0,CME," ~~Just a small correction~~, FYI you can short SQUEEZE silver, especially silver futures, which will impact the price of silver ETFs and stocks dependent on the price of silver.

Shorts on silver futures is arguably more transparent and can be seen on CBOE, CME, and other futures exchange websites.

Some forex & economic calender's will provide CFTC's report on net positions for gold, oil, and s&p 500 futures which can be used as a general market sentiment for a wide range of stock sectors not just commodities.

**update** obviously you can short squeeze silver, what are hedgers & speculators supposed to do when their shorts are nearing margin calls?  lol

**update2** yeah I'll admit there's **probably a coordinated effort into manipulating traders into buying silver thinking there will be a squeeze, don't believe it and probably the worst squeeze strategy**

5,GME," Guys. The media has been saying a ton of stocks are ""Reddit Stocks"" since last week. I won't mention the tickers. 

SLV seems to be a big concern because Citadel owns some. 

It's does. Between 0.5% and 0.93%. It's nothing.

SLV is owned and operated by Black Rock.

Guess who owns 13.2% of GME? Black Rock.

If this stock gets hyped it matters zero fucks. 

At worst, it puts more $ in Black Rock's hands and they are currently out side of the GME equation.

If you're a MM short GME likely you are short other high-short interest retailers. You likely blew up and so you're forced to buy these retailers. This causes the retailers to go up, making your short book even worse off than it otherwise would be. 

Keep in mind the multi managers are pretty levered. So let's walk through an example of a consumer/retail pod at Millennium (MLP) specifically. MLP has an un-leveraged AUM of $40B but I think they lever their book up at least 5x, probably more so they have a GMV of $200B+. I really think the number is 10x but we will act like the number is 5x. They have something like 200 portfolio managers so each one is managing $1B. Lets say you are a typical consumer/retail PM at MLP and you have a 1% short in GME which is worth $10M and then GME goes up 10x. You bought the GME for $10M but now you have to buy back $100M of GME to repay your shares, so you've lost $90M on a GMV of $1B, which contributes to a drawdown to your PnL of 9%. Keep in mind that MLP levered the money 5x before they gave it to you, so to MLP you really lost 45%. (Note that these funds are down something like 10% on the year, which makes sense if you think that 20% of the funds were in consumer/retail pods; down 45% \* 20% = 10%+). MLP has drawdown limits of something like 5-10%. My understanding is you basically are fired if you hit these drawdown limits. Simple put: if you were short GME, I imagine you probably had a tough conversation with the fund.  

The great thing about the multi-manager model is that it looks amazing to LPs. The LPs I know all talk about how the sharpe ratio is excellent at Millennium and how it is essentially a money making machine. The same is true for Citadel GE. It's unsurprising how much money has flowed in this direction. The size of these funds today if you include leverage is MASSIVE. P72 manages $20B. Not sure what Citadel GE manages, but let's say its similar. Not sure about leverage here but I am guessing it is 5-10x, much like Millennium. So adding up the size of these funds including leverage equates to a MASSIVE amount of money in this strategy. If you include all the smaller multi managers, you start to see how it adds up. For each of these funds, your book size may have been cut if you were short GME. In these cases, you are forced to de-gross your book. 

How likely was it that you had to de-gross? Well, it turns out multi-managers are a tough model. You have a limit menu of what you can be short, since it is limited by industry. In theory, this helps you better capture idiosyncratic return (which I believe is true). That said, it means your menu of shorts is limited. If you were a consumer/retail PM, you probably thought shorting GME was a good idea because it was among the shittier retailers out there. 

OK, so if you were short GME in one of these multi-manager funds and you are told to de-gross your book, what trades do you have to do? You have to buy your shorts and sell your longs. What does this mean? It means you have to buy your shorts higher and sell your longs lower. The accumulated affect of many disparate actors doing the same trade at the same time means that the typical short book goes up and the typical long book goes down. This includes the entire book, not just GME. So this means that other high short interest retailers are just going to go up in value, even if they were not targeted by WSB.  

What happens next? Well, it turns out the Tiger Cubs are generally long internet short retail. So they are unfortunately squeezed here. You can see this plainly evidence by their recent performance numbers. Some of them now must de-gross because their retail trade has worked against them. To de-gross, they have to buy retail and sell tech; this unwinds the trade they have had on for many years. What makes matters worse is they all copy eachother, so they are concentrating this trade in the typical basket of ideas they all mimicked from each other. In particular, they must sell some of their favorite tech names, concentrated in FAANMG stocks. 

You know who else is long tech? It turns out the index funds are very overweight tech. They are market cap weighted so it turns out they heavily are weighted towards FAANMG. When the Tiger Cubs are forced to sell FAANMG, this causes the overall indices to print down. 

You know what is modeled off of the indices? Individual stocks. If the indices print down, so will the constituent stocks. 

As you can see there is quite a lot of contagion that is possible from even a single squeeze. Excessive leverage and mimicry has created a fragile ecosystem amongst hedge funds. I am personally very concerned.",metallikoh,5,/r/stocks/comments/l9rdrq/why_is_noone_talking_about_a_possible_market_crash/glkxlet/,0.067,0.845,0.088,0.9649

MLP has an un-leveraged AUM of $40B but I think they lever their book up at least 5x, probably more so they have a GMV of $200B+. I really think the number is 10x but we will act like the number is 5x. They have something like 200 portfolio managers so each one is managing $1B. Lets say you are a typical consumer/retail PM at MLP and you have a 1% short in GME which is worth $10M and then GME goes up 10x. You bought the GME for $10M but now you have to buy back $100M of GME to repay your shares, so you've lost $90M on a GMV of $1B, which contributes to a drawdown to your PnL of 9%. Keep in mind that MLP levered the money 5x before they gave it to you, so to MLP you really lost 45%. (Note that these funds are down something like 10% on the year, which makes sense if you think that 20% of the funds were in consumer/retail pods; down 45% \* 20% = 10%+). MLP has drawdown limits of something like 5-10%. My understanding is you basically are fired if you hit these drawdown limits. Simple put: if you were short GME, I imagine you probably had a tough conversation with the fund.  

The great thing about the multi-manager model is that it looks amazing to LPs. The LPs I know all talk about how the sharpe ratio is excellent at Millennium and how it is essentially a money making machine. The same is true for Citadel GE. It's unsurprising how much money has flowed in this direction. The size of these funds today if you include leverage is MASSIVE. P72 manages $20B. Not sure what Citadel GE manages, but let's say its similar. Not sure about leverage here but I am guessing it is 5-10x, much like Millennium. So adding up the size of these funds including leverage equates to a MASSIVE amount of money in this strategy. If you include all the smaller multi managers, you start to see how it adds up. For each of these funds, your book size may have been cut if you were short GME. In these cases, you are forced to de-gross your book. 

How likely was it that you had to de-gross? Well, it turns out multi-managers are a tough model. You have a limit menu of what you can be short, since it is limited by industry. In theory, this helps you better capture idiosyncratic return (which I believe is true). That said, it means your menu of shorts is limited. If you were a consumer/retail PM, you probably thought shorting GME was a good idea because it was among the shittier retailers out there. 

OK, so if you were short GME in one of these multi-manager funds and you are told to de-gross your book, what trades do you have to do? You have to buy your shorts and sell your longs. What does this mean? It means you have to buy your shorts higher and sell your longs lower. The accumulated affect of many disparate actors doing the same trade at the same time means that the typical short book goes up and the typical long book goes down. This includes the entire book, not just GME. So this means that other high short interest retailers are just going to go up in value, even if they were not targeted by WSB.  

What happens next? Well, it turns out the Tiger Cubs are generally long internet short retail. So they are unfortunately squeezed here. You can see this plainly evidence by their recent performance numbers. Some of them now must de-gross because their retail trade has worked against them. To de-gross, they have to buy retail and sell tech; this unwinds the trade they have had on for many years. What makes matters worse is they all copy eachother, so they are concentrating this trade in the typical basket of ideas they all mimicked from each other. In particular, they must sell some of their favorite tech names, concentrated in FAANMG stocks. 

You know who else is long tech? It turns out the index funds are very overweight tech. They are market cap weighted so it turns out they heavily are weighted towards FAANMG. When the Tiger Cubs are forced to sell FAANMG, this causes the overall indices to print down. 

You know what is modeled off of the indices? Individual stocks. If the indices print down, so will the constituent stocks. 

As you can see there is quite a lot of contagion that is possible from even a single squeeze. Excessive leverage and mimicry has created a fragile ecosystem amongst hedge funds.

While prices will fall when supply increases, I still think with the quality of Zen 3 and the seeming benefits of pairing AMD CPUs with an AMD GPU, as well as the next gen consoles using AMD hardware, this should be a good year for them.

156,GME," In most situations, there is normally some numerical due diligence you can do. For my long term investments, my own personal due diligence starts with financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, etc). I am by no means a financial expert, but having a general of how to read these and interpret the figures is a valuable skill to have. Numbers are harder to for your mind to manipulate based they come at you in the same tone of voice. 

In relation to something like GME, a good due diligence would have been looking through multiple sources to confirm the Short %, research comparable situations, a breakdown of institution shares held, and keeping a close eye on Sell Limits.

Also investing in industries where you have at least a solid general knowledge can help filter out the extra noise and honestly I think is one of the best innate edges that not enough people take advantage of. Using both of these in conjunction with the outside noise will help you gear your mind better.

Shorts could have not escaped this much while volume was so low.

**Look at futures, look at Nasdaq - how come they are still going down? GME goes up if they go down.** A lot of this data is inaccurate and hard to collect. **EVEN if the % drops, this does NOT eliminate short squeeze**. Until it's above 30% or amongst these lines it is still up. Why do YOU think they are STILL restricting trades on robinhood? Why are they telling lies publicly?

This is media cover-up shit. Now for the S3 partners they said the data takes times to get collected. EVEN if they covered a part of their shorts, the CRUCIAL part is still deeply fucked and bleeds. Old positions went out, new entered. We STILL hold the shares and we have the pace.

EDIT2: to the boomers that tell me bolding and wsb terms are dumb. What has that to do with anything..?

177,GME," It's possible that Melvin had 30% loss on Monday, then they took another 23% hit in Tuesday because GME double the price that day, which might actually due to Melvin covering during the day and premarket Wednesday.

On Friday Ortex estimate the short float has decreased to 38m, now S3 also gives a 30m number. If the official number out on Monday(or Tuesday?) is close to this range then we could finally assume the main squeeze is over. (Edit: apologies, it would actually come at 2/9, so still a week out)

Hedge funds are greedy fuckers but they are not stupid, I wouldn't be surprised to know that they quickly saw things don't go their way and gave up. I would actually be more surprised if they still decide to gamble their client's money with enthusiastic retail investors after this whole thing blows up. Makes no sense in a risk management standpoint.

180,ABC," Pretty bad understanding of the situation that is actually happening and how short squeezes originate. Here is an explanation.

First of all, I want to start by saying that some hedge funds are shady fucks. There are a lot of things they did that were shady. Here are a few examples:

[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp)

Now I want to address some of the misconceptions that new traders have about the markets.

1. **I was not allowed to buy shares on RH, did they wanted to drive the price down!?**

DTCC, the clearinghouse for WeBull, RH and other brokerages, recently raised the collateral requirements for GameStop transactions to nearly 100%.

When RH takes a buy order it goes to it's clearinghouse to exchange it's clients money for shares. The shares are immediately and conveniently transferred to the client, but the funds aren’t transferred for 2 days. There's this gap between the broker and the clearinghouse for these unsettled trades that the clearinghouse will require some cash upfront (margin) for but otherwise accepts exposure for the rest.

If the stock being bought is extremely volatile, expensive and has a huge amount of recent volume and therefore unsettled trades, the clearinghouse will eventually realize they are floating quite a lot more to the broker than they are comfortable with on the back of a very risky equity. GME fits all these characteristics. It's this point in the GME scenario where DTCC sets margin requirements to 100%. They tell their brokers, ""Hey if you want to get GME stock from us, we will not accept your word that this trade will settle in two days. Instead we need the money upfront since we are already way too exposed to this one ticker from you.""

Now, if RH wants to continue filling buy orders for it's clients it needs to come up with ALL the money for each trade. RH does not have nearly enough cash on hand to handle this, hence the recent draw down from of RH's credit lines as they try to get enough liquidity to keep buying shares for their clients. Eventually the brokers just don't have enough cash, throw in the towel and stop accepting buy orders until they can settle more trades or the clearinghouses release the margin requirements for these stocks.

The concept that RH would fuck over basically their entire user base on purpose to help a minority investor's minority investment in a hedge fund that already closed their fucking short position doesn't stand up to even the smallest amount of scrutiny. It's just a boring case of the market plumping going wild because it's not built to handle pumps of this scale.

**2. But I was allowed to sell!**

Of course you were. Selling is exiting an already created position. The liability that RH would get if you were not able to sell and the price went down would be insane. They can not stop you from selling an asset that you own. They can, however, block the purchasing of new assets through their platform.

Updated Information:

The DTC only requires collateral on the buying side of the trade. That is the side at risk because the buyer might have bought on margin or with funds that haven't fully settled in their brokerage account (like RH's instant deposit). There is no guarantee that the buyer actually has all the money to complete the trade until it clears 2 days later.
On the sell side, however, you're sending stock to the DTC which doesn't have the same sort of questionable backing. They can accept that stock with a high level of confidence and debit the broker's clearing firm whatever the stock was to have sold for. So selling is pretty easy for a broker because they can debit you and get a reliable debit from DTC which clears the immediate credit risk for the broker.
DTC is the one left holding the bag if the buyer fails to come through. [I'm not 100% sure about the next part, but I think it's right.] DTC will then keep the collateral payment as well as sell the orphaned stock at market price to recoup part of the loss and write off the rest (or they might make a profit if the stock rose in value during the clearing process). This is where another risk to DTC comes in - if the buyer defaults and the orphaned stock drops steeply in value during the settlement period (as $GME is very likely to do), then they have to rely on the collateral for most of their coverage. That's why they raised collateral for $GME.
Back to the original point, Robinhood didn't shut down selling because of liability risk - but because they simply didn't need to do that. DTC was only making buys difficult to complete.


**3. But Fidelity and ThinkorSwim allowed people to buy and sell.**

Thinkorswim and Fidelity own their own clearing houses and have enough shares to satisfy the orders. Also, they do not need to pay collateral since they are a clearing house.

**4. Okay, but what about the 120% short interest, Melvin will be closing their position soon, and a short squeeze will happen.**

Melvin claims that they closed some of their positions. There was enough volume for them to do so. 

The short interest are just estimations. Short interest information gets released on 15th and 30th of each month. Next week we will be able to see the short positions.

Hedge funds keep taking short positions and are much better prepared for now, because there is more money to be made on riding a stock down to 40 from 400, then from 5 to 1.

The whole assumption for a short squeeze incoming is built around the assumption that there is still short interest of over 100%, however, there is not confirmed data, as it comes out on 2/9.

Many hedge funds are also riding the wave up, and have long positions in GME. Blackrock, one of the biggest money managers already made insane profit, and will probably ride this on a way down.

**5. But a short squeeze will happen!**

It could, or it could not. The interest in not high to a point were they will go bankrupt or have to buy back the shares to cover. They can comfortably hold for 6-12 month as long as they don’t get margin called, which I don’t expect them too, tbh. The payoff makes sense, think about it this way. The interest is I think 30% yearly. Let’s say you short a billion dollars worth GME. You pay annual interest of 30-40%. Hedge funds definitely have enough money to pay that 300 million a year. Now, let’s say in a year a price goes down from 400 to 40. A fund will make essentially 900 million dollars minus the interest fee and etc. it is a no brainer for some bigger funds to take this position and enjoy their easy 40% profit.

Considering many funds have insane amounts of collateral, they will not get margin called from this.

**6. But if options expire in the money they have to sell their shares!**

A lot of options expired ITM on Friday, so why did the price not go up?

Well, how many retail investors that were holding their options actually had enough money to buy 100 shares at a strike price? Not too many.

Additional information:

Assigned/exercised options move stock between people/institutions. However, this movement does not affect the current stock price. (UNLESS someone sold uncovered calls).
The volume of calls or puts being assigned does not matter.
Example: stock ABC closes at $11 on expiration. Investor A owns a $10 call, and it is exercised. The seller of the call (investor B)  already owns the shares (or owns another call at different strike). The following transaction occurs: Investor A gives B $1000, Investor B gives A 100 shares of stock ABC.
IIRC, no volume is reported for ABC, neither a buy nor a sell occurred, and ACB price does not change.
IF they were uncovered calls (not really allowed, its significantly more risk than naked shorts), then Investor B would need to by 100 shares of ABC at current price, prior to the call being exercised.

**7. Okay, but Hedge funds are still bad and evil!**

Sure, I agree. Some are. Some hedge funds get their funding from managing pensions and endowments funds.

**8. But Citadel was manipulating the markets!**

Citadel and Citadel securities are two separate LLCs. They are only allowed to open long positions, they can not short a stock. One is a market maker that processes option orders and has no say in the markets. In fact, the more volume there is, the more money they make on the spreads. Would jot be surprised if Citadel made a lot of money on market making in the past week.

**9. But Hedge funds are insane investors with 50% annual return.**

Not necessarily true, an average hedge fund has been underperforming for the past 20 years. You probably had better returns then them just by investing in index funds. Don't get me wrong, a lot of smart people work in the funds, but their main goal is to hedge, in other words, be safe from market movements in any direction.

**TL;DR**

Hedge funds are bad, but they are not retarded (except for Melvin, who overextends on a short at $5)

But many of the rules that came in play were written decades ago, they were not taken from thin air. Battling against hedge funds is okay, but throwing different theories that will be easily disapproved once they file 13F will not take them down.

That is the side at risk because the buyer might have bought on margin or with funds that haven't fully settled in their brokerage account (like RH's instant deposit). There is no guarantee that the buyer actually has all the money to complete the trade until it clears 2 days later.
On the sell side, however, you're sending stock to the DTC which doesn't have the same sort of questionable backing. They can accept that stock with a high level of confidence and debit the broker's clearing firm whatever the stock was to have sold for. So selling is pretty easy for a broker because they can debit you and get a reliable debit from DTC which clears the immediate credit risk for the broker.
DTC is the one left holding the bag if the buyer fails to come through. [I'm not 100% sure about the next part, but I think it's right.] DTC will then keep the collateral payment as well as sell the orphaned stock at market price to recoup part of the loss and write off the rest (or they might make a profit if the stock rose in value during the clearing process). This is where another risk to DTC comes in - if the buyer defaults and the orphaned stock drops steeply in value during the settlement period (as $GME is very likely to do), then they have to rely on the collateral for most of their coverage. That's why they raised collateral for $GME.
Back to the original point, Robinhood didn't shut down selling because of liability risk - but because they simply didn't need to do that. DTC was only making buys difficult to complete.


**3. But Fidelity and ThinkorSwim allowed people to buy and sell.**

Thinkorswim and Fidelity own their own clearing houses and have enough shares to satisfy the orders. Also, they do not need to pay collateral since they are a clearing house.

**4. Okay, but what about the 120% short interest, Melvin will be closing their position soon, and a short squeeze will happen.**

Melvin claims that they closed some of their positions. There was enough volume for them to do so. 

The short interest are just estimations. Short interest information gets released on 15th and 30th of each month. Next week we will be able to see the short positions.

Hedge funds keep taking short positions and are much better prepared for now, because there is more money to be made on riding a stock down to 40 from 400, then from 5 to 1.

The whole assumption for a short squeeze incoming is built around the assumption that there is still short interest of over 100%, however, there is not confirmed data, as it comes out on 2/9.

Many hedge funds are also riding the wave up, and have long positions in GME. Blackrock, one of the biggest money managers already made insane profit, and will probably ride this on a way down.

**5. But a short squeeze will happen!**

It could, or it could not. The interest in not high to a point were they will go bankrupt or have to buy back the shares to cover. They can comfortably hold for 6-12 month as long as they don’t get margin called, which I don’t expect them too, tbh. The payoff makes sense, think about it this way. The interest is I think 30% yearly. Let’s say you short a billion dollars worth GME. You pay annual interest of 30-40%. Hedge funds definitely have enough money to pay that 300 million a year. Now, let’s say in a year a price goes down from 400 to 40. A fund will make essentially 900 million dollars minus the interest fee and etc. it is a no brainer for some bigger funds to take this position and enjoy their easy 40% profit.

Considering many funds have insane amounts of collateral, they will not get margin called from this.

**6. But if options expire in the money they have to sell their shares!**

A lot of options expired ITM on Friday, so why did the price not go up?

Well, how many retail investors that were holding their options actually had enough money to buy 100 shares at a strike price? Not too many.

Additional information:

Assigned/exercised options move stock between people/institutions. However, this movement does not affect the current stock price. (UNLESS someone sold uncovered calls).
The volume of calls or puts being assigned does not matter.
Example: stock ABC closes at $11 on expiration. Investor A owns a $10 call, and it is exercised. The seller of the call (investor B)  already owns the shares (or owns another call at different strike). The following transaction occurs: Investor A gives B $1000, Investor B gives A 100 shares of stock ABC.
IIRC, no volume is reported for ABC, neither a buy nor a sell occurred, and ACB price does not change.
IF they were uncovered calls (not really allowed, its significantly more risk than naked shorts), then Investor B would need to by 100 shares of ABC at current price, prior to the call being exercised.

**7. Okay, but Hedge funds are still bad and evil!**

Sure, I agree. Some are. Some hedge funds get their funding from managing pensions and endowments funds.

**8. But Citadel was manipulating the markets!**

Citadel and Citadel securities are two separate LLCs. They are only allowed to open long positions, they can not short a stock. One is a market maker that processes option orders and has no say in the markets. In fact, the more volume there is, the more money they make on the spreads. Would jot be surprised if Citadel made a lot of money on market making in the past week.

**9. But Hedge funds are insane investors with 50% annual return.**

Not necessarily true, an average hedge fund has been underperforming for the past 20 years. You probably had better returns then them just by investing in index funds. Don't get me wrong, a lot of smart people work in the funds, but their main goal is to hedge, in other words, be safe from market movements in any direction.

**TL;DR**

Hedge funds are bad, but they are not retarded (except for Melvin, who overextends on a short at $5)

But many of the rules that came in play were written decades ago, they were not taken from thin air. Battling against hedge funds is okay, but throwing different theories that will be easily disapproved once they file 13F will not take them down. Knowing how markets work, and being vigilant is how you make more money than hedge funds.",MichKOG,51,/r/stocks/comments/l9p5ve/s3_alleges_significant_gme_shorts_were_covered/glk1drv/,0.069,0.81,0.121,0.9982
184,RH," Pretty bad understanding of the situation that is actually happening and how short squeezes originate. Here is an explanation.

First of all, I want to start by saying that some hedge funds are shady fucks. There are a lot of things they did that were shady. Here are a few examples:

[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp)

Now I want to address some of the misconceptions that new traders have about the markets.

1. **I was not allowed to buy shares on RH, did they wanted to drive the price down!?**

DTCC, the clearinghouse for WeBull, RH and other brokerages, recently raised the collateral requirements for GameStop transactions to nearly 100%.

When RH takes a buy order it goes to it's clearinghouse to exchange it's clients money for shares. The shares are immediately and conveniently transferred to the client, but the funds aren’t transferred for 2 days. There's this gap between the broker and the clearinghouse for these unsettled trades that the clearinghouse will require some cash upfront (margin) for but otherwise accepts exposure for the rest.

If the stock being bought is extremely volatile, expensive and has a huge amount of recent volume and therefore unsettled trades, the clearinghouse will eventually realize they are floating quite a lot more to the broker than they are comfortable with on the back of a very risky equity. GME fits all these characteristics. It's this point in the GME scenario where DTCC sets margin requirements to 100%. They tell their brokers, ""Hey if you want to get GME stock from us, we will not accept your word that this trade will settle in two days. Instead we need the money upfront since we are already way too exposed to this one ticker from you.""

Now, if RH wants to continue filling buy orders for it's clients it needs to come up with ALL the money for each trade. RH does not have nearly enough cash on hand to handle this, hence the recent draw down from of RH's credit lines as they try to get enough liquidity to keep buying shares for their clients. Eventually the brokers just don't have enough cash, throw in the towel and stop accepting buy orders until they can settle more trades or the clearinghouses release the margin requirements for these stocks.

The concept that RH would fuck over basically their entire user base on purpose to help a minority investor's minority investment in a hedge fund that already closed their fucking short position doesn't stand up to even the smallest amount of scrutiny. It's just a boring case of the market plumping going wild because it's not built to handle pumps of this scale.

**2. But I was allowed to sell!**

Of course you were. Selling is exiting an already created position. The liability that RH would get if you were not able to sell and the price went down would be insane. They can not stop you from selling an asset that you own. They can, however, block the purchasing of new assets through their platform.

That is the side at risk because the buyer might have bought on margin or with funds that haven't fully settled in their brokerage account (like RH's instant deposit).

if the reason brookers closed the ""buy"", is so simple and easy why none of them said that during interviews ? We all saw the many Vlad RH interviews he was just babbling around, why not tell the reason above ?

In acting as a middleman, the clearinghouse provides the security and efficiency that is integral to stability in a financial market. In order to act efficiently, a clearinghouse takes the opposite position of each trade, which greatly reduces the cost and risk of settling multiple transactions among multiple parties. While their mandate is to reduce risk, the fact that they have to act as both buyer and seller at the inception of a trade means that they are subject to default risk from both parties. To mitigate this, clearinghouses impose margin requirements.

270,DD," I commented this in another thread, will post it here as well.

The way I see it there are several questions that need answered.

•	⁠what is the short interest right now?

•	⁠What is the cost basis for the shorts, do shorts that entered at 4 dollars still need to cover (unlikely) or are the shorts mainly made up of people who entered between 200-400 (likely imo).

•	⁠Is the Ortex and S3 short data true (bad for you) or false (maybe good for you).

•	⁠Do the shorts care about paying borrowing fees when the penalty of covering all at once is so big, unlikely I think.

•	⁠Do shares need to be bought because of options that expired itm on Friday or were they all hedges before Friday, I would bet they were hedged before Friday.

Depending on your thoughts on those questions you can probably find your answer. For me, this is now outside my risk tolerance due to the fact that we have exceeded what is imo a reasonable value for GameStop and the amount of uncertainty surrounding all the data. As such I have fully exited my position as of 9:15 this morning.

“While long shareholders are looking at significant mark-to-market gains, shorts are now down -$13.38 billion in year-to-date mark-to-market losses,” he wrote. “Both fundamental and momentum short sellers have found opportunities and price exit points to trim their positions in the face of these losses as the GME short squeeze is in full force.”",new_patriot_david,0,/r/stocks/comments/labfji/over_5_million_shares_of_gme_failed_to_deliver/glnhiiu/,0.038,0.853,0.109,0.7964

Do they work just like day orders, just in the morning?

I have a limit order for 8 shares at 15.50, set to extended AM, but it'sjust sitting there even though it's dipped below 15.50 a couple of times..

Any idea what's going on with that? Or am I not understanding how that works?

The Fidelity help I talked to this morning said they've never had such call volume and it's an ""all hands on deck"" day, ""pretty wild."" So I think it going down a lot today is just today while so many people (like me) are  joining the game. 
2. Much more fun to watch today, than GME, lulz (because it's staying green/going up - so far this morning). While I got this for the fun, I figure it's a long-term thing and, if it does drop drastically after all this, in a few years it'll do OK as theaters re-open and we ""get back to normal.""

**Question about downward trend on Gamestop Puts**

I've been watching this GME insanity with a good deal of interest, and am of the belief that the stock is highly overvalued. It seems as though short interest has gone down significantly as well - seeing varying numbers, but far below the \~130% short interest at the beginning of the saga. As such, I would have guessed that there would be a lot of interest in purchasing puts - betting that the stock will drop much close to its original levels in the next few months, certainly by January 2022 and 2023. However, most put options seem to be down today. Does anyone have any guesses as to why this might be? I am tempted to buy puts <$40 or so for middle of this year and the January strike points, but thought I'd ask for feedback because of the put prices being down.

TLDR: tempted by GME sub $40 puts because I believe the stock is massively overvalued, but am surprised those puts aren't climbing in value. And trying to validate my theory that they should indeed climb significantly \*if\* GME continues its dive in the future (give or take time value/picking the right targets, etc).",MaterialSituation,4,/r/stocks/comments/l9y3e7/rstocks_daily_discussion_monday_feb_01_2021/glmt6md/,0.041,0.832,0.128,0.9583

Most rich people are just as greedy/not greedy and risk averse/risky as anyone of any other income level. 

The difference is they have greater means to access parts of the market we don't where you can make far, far greater returns.

A short squeeze is possible if the SI % of float is high (ideally > 100%) and people are holding (extremely low volume). SI % of float is only ~53% now and the daily trade volume is more than the float. So I just don't see how a squeeze is possible.

And there's no denying what the restrictions did to the price compounding and compounded by the reduction of competition to buy at that discount. Also, when they said the volatility was too high, it wasn't.  Finally, TradeZero was one of the brokers that clears that Apex, and they refused to restrict trading which means that some aspect of this was/is voluntary.

716,GME," That's my understanding of it. 

Keep in mind this is not financial advice and I barely have any clue what I'm talking about, and if anyone sees anything wrong with what I'm saying please correct me.

The short hedge funds could have made an off market (AKA Over-The-Counter) trade with an institution holding GME shares. Essentially they pay the institution for the shares, the shares are transferred to them, and none of this is recorded on the trade volume for GME. 

So while it looks like there is no possible way trade volume occurred for GME shorts to have covered down to 50%, it's because the trade that allowed them to cover was off market and doesn't actually show up on the trade volume. 

I'm starting to get a bit fearful of the WSB echo chamber. I've seen multiple people trying to bring this to light and get downvoted into oblivion while the new narrative seems to be that they covered using counterfeit shares or something similar. 

The general mentality of the sub has gone from ""the data is on our side"" to ""the data must be wrong/falsified.""

I've been on reddit 10+ years and this blows everything out of the water. I take all major articles on this with a MAJOR grain of salt.  But I don't think it's malicious per se as wsb thinks.

719,GME, This sounds like desperation. A minute of scrolling through Reddit would tell you it's false.

720,GME," IMO holders are actually shooting themselves in the foot because they aren’t factoring in “self interest” and SEC into their calculations.

Holding is diametrically opposed to the psychology of self interest. Holding requires solidarity despite what is financially advantageous to you individually. Contrary to the prevailing rhetoric, most new WSB don’t give a shit about the political elements of WSB vs Wall Street (contrary to what they say) they want to make money. So, if they are looking for profits and they pay a premium (over 200) for a ticket to “infinite”profits they will get scared when they see the share price fall from 325 to 250. They start to do the math. They start to wonder if tomorrow the share price will fall under 200 and then they will lose money. So eventually they have to decide if they will tap out after “only” making a few hundred or if they will take the chance and lose money. Most rational people will take their profits.

2. If the SEC limits trading of $GME shares for 1 week holders are screwed. They are screwed because $GME’s valuation is purely hype now. A few days of no $GME chat would tank this stock. When the moratorium is lifted the shares will automatically trade lower as holders would be looking to offload their “rotting” assets.

Extra variable: $GME releasing more shares and or releasing an earnings report that isn’t rosy.

Second, the source does not confirm your original comment of Ford being a finalist for a yet-to-be-determined contract. It’s merely the opinion of a columnist for Motley Fool. 

Ford does do the well in government contracts. But they have been for years. This is nothing new that points to a shift in market share. 

What is important, imo, is the battle for Tesla’s market cap. There is a lot of skin there. And that is from consumer sales. 

The reason I favor GM is because they have committed to a 13 car line. Ford has plans for 6. Also, in 2020, Tesla had the largest gain. GM had the second largest. 

That said, I don’t think anyone could go wrong with either GM or Ford. I just prefer GM. Those two are definitely way ahead of other rivals.",TheGourmetHotDog,3,/r/stocks/comments/la8gtx/fords_partnership_with_google/gln5def/,0.1,0.801,0.099,-0.2644

As a newbie that's the conclusion I reached after setting up and funding a Fidelity account Thursday night, fully intent on buying a share or two of GME the next day.  I calmed down and realized that if people like me were finding out about this through hype and mainstream media, then I'm way too late to the party to actually make big gains.  It might still keep going up, but the return I'd get is nowhere near worth the risk at the current price - and I don't have nearly enough knowledge or experience to take advantage of the instability we might see come this next week.

I got in early, when it was in the $30s.. been following it since it was $18... i sold 2 call options early that would be worth around $50k had i held it. Also sold my shares on thursday and honestly I'm kicking the living shit out of myself over this whole thing.. I sold when the news got crazy.. I was skeptical it would take off but had a feeling it would.. and when it did I knew there would be a ton of controversy, but Ryan Cohen does provide alot of potential.. A big reason I feel that GME was mostly failing was because of all the shorts. People value their analysis, and therefore dont buy into GME, thus creating a loss in share value.. its almost as if they were trying to make GME tank. And Andrew Left live stream, he didn't really provide any good analysis why it would fail, he just seemed scared and trying to convince people it would fail.. They'd been shorting it for years. Had they succeed they would've made billions.. thus being the bad guy and manipulating the market for their gain..  but now with all the media attn, the public hating the short sellers, and seeing it as a saving a company.. with Ryan Cohen and switching to primarily e-commerce, and gaming being a multi billion dollar business. Gamestop can really capitalize on this opportunity and become a very big name in the gaming business.. plus selling shares from their treasury and gaining capital to help it grow... it can potentially fucking rocket and stay there after the squeeze in my very amatuer skeptical opinion.

889,GME," WSB really got out of control. Literally out of control. It went from 1.7 million members to 7.7 million members in the span of around 10 days. Those 6 million new members were not part of the original group who bought into this and started the ball rolling. They are parroting things they, at best, vaguely understand.

This thing has become a bizarre mixture of greed and populism which has really driven people into an echo chamber. If you buy any stock other than GME then you must be a bot trying to pull people away. If you don't believe GME will get to $5000 then you are a shill. 

And in the meantime, many of them are looking for the next GME already. They think this is just what happens when 7 million people buy a stock, that everyone gets rich. Many of them are really buying into the idea that WSB is basically a hedge fund now. But what they are failing to realize is illegalities aside, if 7 million people pump up a stock those are the 7 million people who are holding the stock when it starts to sell too. A pump and dump only benefits the earliest people pumping it, not the people who do it near the top.

899,NGD," The first thing you need to do is learn the very basics, revenue, free cashflow, net income, earnings per share, cash on hand, debt, and PE ratio (that one is a waste of time in my opinion). Also all options are is a way to leverage returns on a specific stock, but if have you no idea how to value that stock then why the hell would you be buying a call or put right? So learning how to value a stock is the first step, and yes I mean actually putting a price on it that it should be trading at. The model is simple, estimate forward revenue and cost, to either get an income number or a free cashflow number. Once you do that translate that number into a stock price. 

Real life example: A gold and copper miner I own called NGD is currently trading at 1.92 a share. Now Based on guidance and my revenue estimates for this company, I know that their free cash flow in the next 12 months will be roughly $300 million. Now NGD has 676 million shares outstanding so I’m going to use that number to get the cash flow per share multiple. So I will divide $300 million by 676 million shares which gets me a price of 0.444 a share. Now I will then divide the current stock price by that number to get the forward free cash flow multiple which is 4.32. Now what does that number mean? It means the stock trades at 4.32 times their free cash flow. Now given the fact that the industry standard free cash flow multiple in the gold mining sector ranges from 6-12 That immediately tells me that NGD is significantly undervalued when compared to its competitors. Now how do I value the stock to get the fair value? Easy, I use the multiple I got and say to myself, what should this multiple be? Now given the fact that the industry standard ranges from 6-12 and NGD has a fairly strong balance sheet I say that it should be 10. Now I’ll use that multiple and multiply it by NGD’s free cash flow per share which gives me a stock price of 4.44 which we can round to 4.50 (fair value estimate). 
With that information I then determine that NGD is significantly undervalued and I’ll make a trade. Depending on my risk profile I might just buy shares or buy 50% shares and 50% calls (options) to leverage my gains. Obviously I take into account a few more factors but that is the very basics of it.

916,GME," The VW ""Infinity Squeeze"" situation is completely different than what's going on now and people need to stop comparing them.

The VW Infinity squeeze started with a short interest around 12.8% of outstanding shares. At that time, about 55% of shares were held between Porsche and several other funds, Porsche alone having a 30% stake. Then, in a surprise move no one really expected, Porsche increased their stake in VW by abut 44%, putting over 70% of VW stocks in control of 1 company, and leaving about 1% actively being traded on the market. Also important to note the #2 largest owner of VW was a Government Index Fund from the home province of VW, holding about 20%. So that's over 90% of the stock held by 2 entities that have little to no reason to dump and run during a spike.

Essentially, finding out there were barely any shares available to cover shorts, investors panicked to cover their positions and Porsche held all the cards. Porsche squeezed the shorters and made out like bandits.


Now let's look at GME. Of the float shares, Blackrock and Fidelity own about 25% between them, if you expand that to the top 10 holders, all investment funds, that goes up to 60% of shares. All companies with no personal tie to the company itself and solely looking for profits. My guess would be the remaining 40% is mostly in the hands of other investment funds, and not retail.

I'm not going to change your mind, you're not going to change mine.

I think having cash on the side to buy the dip is exactly the same as trying to time the market where you'll just miss out on any growth that happens while you're waiting. And, if there is any inflation whatsoever, you are, by definition, selling your dollars for a loss every time. But for some reason the magical $USD ticker throws the logic applied to all other tickers out the window and allows for some distorted reasoning about why it's fine to sell this ticker for a loss when it's a good dip to buy other tickers, but selling $JNJ for a loss when crispr is on sale with an even bigger loss is ""emotional"" ""uphill battle"" ""lose money because of it.""

We do exactly the same thing, only you put your ""powder"" in $USD, I put my ""powder in stable stocks. Then you act like selling your USD is somehow different than me selling my JNJ.

The only wrinkle I added in my first post is that, at the top I like more money in $JNJ, and at the bottom more money in dunno $ARKG. And as the market shifts, I rebalance. ie. take profits.

958,DD," An opinion of someone who got in early last week and exited today:

The likelihood of a squeeze is now virtually non-existent.

I got into this when there was still some decent DD on WSB early last week, including >$120% short interest.

Notice how that's all dissipated and it's now just ""HOLD THE LINE!!"" with nothing to back it up.

Statistically and rationally, there is no data to support a bullish position/short squeeze right now.

Short interest has gone down drastically (\~50% range), and the only ""DD"" that is on WSB now is to plug your ears and go ""NOPE, EVERYONE IS LYING!""

If that's the hill you want to die on, go for it, it's a free country, but I think a lot of people are going to be left with heavy bags when this thing falls back to earth this week.

What troubles me the most is that the only ""rationale"" that the squeeze is still on is complete garbage bro-science, and is predicated on the most ridiculous point

Basically, since $GME was shorted 138% early buyers (people who spend less than 50 per share on GME) figured out they could raise the price of GME by holding their shares since there weren’t enough shares if a margin call happened. That play was solid and made them a TON of money. Things changed when GME became politicized and new hype investors came in. They were paying 200, 300, and even 400 per share to try to get a squeeze.

I believe GME is worth 15 per share NOT 300 per share and the price correction has started",bladerunner2088,10,/r/stocks/comments/la7tqw/coherent_explanation_of_gme_anyone/glmlh5u/,0.028,0.843,0.128,0.9797
961,CAN," Honestly, it's not worth bothering with. Even if it does happen, is the risk worth it? Maybe if someone is fine wasting a ton of money on a stupid gamble or if you didn't put much money in the first place.

I bought late (3@325 on Wednesay) knowing the risk, but I was a little jaded/brainwashed thinking it was more likely to happen than it is. And maybe it was. I bought in a bit before Robinhood and other brokers put a stop to buying. If they didn't do that, who knows what price the stock would be at right now? I might have been able to actually make a decent profit. But sadly that's not what happened and that's all there is to it. And now it has the added downside of, like others have said, shorts already covering their positions and how they have a million tricks to make sure it just stays lower and lower until it fizzles out.

I just now sold my shares at 235 for about a \~365 dollar loss. It's a fun gamble, and that's purely it. At one point you have to say ""enough is enough"" and pull out, and I'm not so stupid that I'm going to lose 1000 dollars over some ""message,"" even though I CAN if I want and be fine. I'm new to investing jumping in with this, and all it was was a crash course in what not to do. So I can't be mad over losing 360 dollars because it taught me a lot of information that I'll utilize for future investments.

Even if it WERE to magically squeeze, I'd have no regrets pulling out because it was equally as likely (or maybe actually MORE likely) that the stock would've just continued to plummet until it reached 20 a share. It would take a miracle for it to suddenly spike back up to 350, 400, 500 a share.

It was a fun 360 dollar ticket to possibly one of the craziest situations for the stock market ever, but that's all it was. If any of my friends were to ask me ""should I buy in now while it's 230-235 a share?"" I would tell them not to, with an added ""stay the hell away from it.""",KansaiKanpai,4,/r/stocks/comments/la7tqw/coherent_explanation_of_gme_anyone/glmt70u/,0.135,0.746,0.119,-0.6029

Watched it all week, lost sleep got pumped about potential gains.
Seen it rise on Thursday, my account was 9.5k profit, and hour later was 1.8k

Tried to find any shread of hope on stocks over the weekend and you guys really grounded me, thank you!
Sold out today @236 for 4k profit. Mainly because after watching wsb turn into what could possibly be all the qanon knobheads who need their next fix I got fed up listening and reading about it and wanted out.

Don't even care if it pops anymore I made 800% profit and learnt a shit load along the way so I count myself one of the lucky ones.

I just want my old wsb loss porn back, im obv not rich or anything I just loved the humour and crazy ideas those bastards had.

But now I have a nice fund to build my investment portfolio on and I have r/stocks to thank for alot of that even though it was wsb that got me to pull the trigger.

There are some stocks whereby I am able to tell myself to hold for years and ignore the short term movements and not take a single cent in profit (e.g NET avg $38 and MWK avg ~$20 after averaging up) because I absolutely trust the company to do well and is a market disruptor. 

There are some whereby I got taken by surprise and sold to get back my cost after it ran up too high (e.g. NIO (bought at $15 when it wasn’t super meme and CHWY (I love this stock but the current valuation is a little out of my expected range)

I actually bought BBBY after their last ER, it was a no brainer. 2.2b cash and equivalent but 2.6b market cap, with positive earnings and a great new leadership. Immediate buy. Didn’t think it ended up getting a part of the short squeeze and I sold at high 40s because I don’t think BBBY is worth double what I got it for. Am also not interested in investing in a company for ‘short squeeze potential’, this will hurt a lot of people in the long term.

Thats not what is happening. You can short more stocks then there are because you can short a stock multiple times . You can buy and sell stock multiple times you know.

>My assumption is they weren’t anticipating this Reddit fiasco to take place and now they’re fucked since they shorted shares that aren’t real. 

Last year hedge funds lost 300 billion in shorting stock. It sometimes fails spectacular. Didn't stop hedge funds from making more profit then ever in 2020 .

Did they expect reddit? No but that doesn't mean they can't find a solution that doesn't entail making everyone one reddit rich. There are plenty of solutions they can do that will cost them money but keep it limited and manageable.

> Truthfully idk how this plays out but I’m in too deep now I put all my profits from GME calls that I sold a week too early into shares (missed out on 80 grand) so it’s championship or bust

Yeah its clear you dont know, be careful with things like this plenty of people want to pretend its ""a sure thing"" but most of the time they either just want you in to get higher profits themselves or dont know what they are talking about.

I don't understand the negativity of the other posters.

CCL has had ZERO REVENUE for 10 months.  Even if they start out at only 10% capacity, that's a lot better than zero revenues.

CCL doesn't need to to have a record year in order for the stock to go up, they just have to do better than what they are doing right now.

I only see 2 scenarios where CCL stock doesn't rise:

&#x200B;

1. The COVID vaccine doesn't work, period.  The positive infection rate a year from now is the same as it is now.  If that happens, we're all screwed.
2. CCL doesn't have enough cash on hand to outlast COVID.  But all the press releases claim that CCL has enough cash to last another 12 months with no revenues before they go under.

1089,CEO," https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/former-chewy-ceo-ryan-cohen-urges-gamestop-to-become-the-amazon-of-video-games.html


>Ryan Cohen, the former CEO of Chewy, thinks the maligned video-fame retailer can turn itself around by shifting its focus away from physical stores in favor of a building robust e-commerce platform. Cohen thinks GameStop can use its brand and large customer base to make that transition. He has taken a large stake in the company to try and push it in that direction.


It was the plan since ryan cohen bought 9 million shares earlier this year, and that plan gets a lot easier if they have billions in capital to aggressively go after growth opportunities imo. 


I'm not saying ""GME is definitely a hold right now"" I'm just bringing up a discussion point nobody is talking about, anything is possible right now, but any way it plays out, this has been a godsend for gamestops future.


If they have 6 billion in cash, and zero debt, it is a **fundamentally** different company than the failing brick and mortar retail business of a year ago. 



Blockbuster went bankrupt, but before they did what if they got a sudden 10 billion dollar cash infusion to work with, and pivoted into online rentals / streaming and became the netflix we know today? See what I'm trying to get at lol.

That's a really arrogant and dumb thing to do regardless of what you believe will happen. Buy anyway, these new shorts Citidel sold last week won't start being squeezed for another month or so. Interest takes time.

TL;DR People are saying ""HOLD"" because while holding costs the long positions next to nothing, the Hedge Funds must pay 18% interest to hold.
