0,AC, I love M1 and I’ve used this before actually. My AC blew right at the start of the lockdown last year and I was laid off. Just borrowed a couple grand to fix it while collecting my unemployment. I didn’t take much out so my interest was only a couple bucks a month and once work resumed I paid it all back immediately. Just didn’t want to use all my cash until I knew what my schedule was.,nuffin_stuff,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/mtc0p7/is_there_a_difference_between_borrowing_margin/guzhn9i/,0.036,0.816,0.148,0.835

8,RH, You could always do a brokerage transfer and pay no fees on it because you wouldn’t be selling. And I’m not sure if there is any downside I did use Robinhood but mainly for options before I moved to TD. You could ask support but knowing RH you’re gonna be waiting a while. On a side note fidelity offers zero Commission funds that might be worth looking into for you. Personally I have some in my IRA,bagel_boy_potatoman,2,/r/RobinHood/comments/mt0ia5/is_there_a_downside_to_buying_index_funds_on/guxpe1e/,0.075,0.848,0.077,0.48
