\- I read this morning that retail is only 10% of traders/investors, if true who TF is he kidding? This is BS and manipulation.

\- Predictions of ""another leg down"" and ""another crash"" were written/promoted in MSM since Mar. 2020. If anything, that has produced poor results and ""crashophobia"" for many individual investor/traders.

\- My opinion, Burry likely dealt with overwhelming guilt and probably worse after his big ""win"" I think he has ongoing mental health issues due in part to that, or perhaps he's just flat out as mature as a 12 year old.

80,GME," Agree that he is often wrong, and there are probably 7.5 billion factors for that.  But he also has a penchant for being right too early.  His ""short the housing market"" efforts started in early 2005, and the crash didn't happen for almost 3 years.  He bought a bunch of water/utilities and farmland after that, a few years before the Flint water crisis, and years before Bill Gates decided to buy farms.  He bought GME at least a year before the big squeeze (credit though - he bought GME after DFV did).

91,IMO," he never accounted for asset inflation in response to the issues he was raising IMO.  All of his comments are true, the problem is the federal reserve and government will keep socializing the losses of private entities because corporations have been so irresponsible and the entire country would potentially collapse if they stopped supporting these markets. This is because they have kept the faucets on for years and have only pumped more money in instead of being smart and forcing these freeloading corps to actually make some fucking money. 

Until the treasury unloads its positions and the fed stops pushing interest rates down and starts raising the bubble will continue to grow.

93,IMO," Being early works well enough if you are making a short bet. You can make that bet a few times over, and make huge amounts of money when it eventually pays off.

&#x200B;

Being a few years early and trying to warn investors is worthless. Historically, big crashes seem to wipe out around 3 years of growth. If you listen to his prediction 3 years early and pull out of the market to be safe, you end up losing money unless you can then perfectly time reentering the market at the bottom.

&#x200B;

He was at least 4 years early at predicting this next crash. So if it does not happen by the end of this year, and reduce the market by at least 50%, it's another worthless prediction, IMO.

&#x200B;

I know he'll be right eventually, and I don't think that will just be random chance necessarily.

If you are in business you know prices don’t go down. For the simple reason that you can’t scale up creating more expenses and having the same amount of margin. You have to ⬆️ the price in order to supply the demand and stay in business.

Remember people consume WAY more than a decade ago. So yes prices continue to go up with or without “inflation”. The real question is how many people can keep buying? Thats where in my opinion inflation comes in play. Scarcity not abundance.

576,IR," Some random thoughts from me who holds 8xxx. 

Institutional money got in back in March. Sure, a squeeze might be on the menu but I don't care about the short interest. In fact, this stock deserved to be shorted after what was a pretty disastrous beginning of 2021. Things have improved since, slowly but surely. I also think they got caught up in the nasty tech rotation and exit out of EV plays generally that we saw back in February/March. 

March institutional filings: https://i.imgur.com/e9v8MbX.jpg 

Comments I've made on the SEC investigation which is often brought up in discussion: https://i.imgur.com/QrzxjNn.jpg 

I was also pleased to see them take their time with the manufacturing site selection. Rather than rush to throw investors a bone, they seemed to have selected a state with the right incentives and a Governor with a hard on for supporting them. Some additional comments I've made on that: https://i.imgur.com/v7dVfAO.jpg 

During IR day, some interesting comments were made about their app. Tony Aquila's previous experience in software makes me intrigued about this.

With the current share price around $10, all these shorts are underwater, not including the exorbitantly high interest they have been paying for the last 3 months.

Since then, GOEV had nothing but great news. They've secured a contact manufacturer (VDL Nedcar). They've obtained $300m in incentives from the State of Oklahoma.

This should be noted as a major risk for any of these companies, as some will fall from favor fast. And if there’s anything in the world that will drop a company’s pipeline fast, it’s medicine.

You can laugh at me, I deserve it, but also I seek advice if you can offer it.. wtf should I do here to minimize my losses?

I actually didn't realize I was trading on a margin account.. it was just a normal investing acct before I applied to trade options.

I put in 2k cad and when I made the order for 20 contracts it quoted me roughly 1k CAD.. I was fine with possibly losing 1k as a learning experience.

I'm now seeing this is a potentially much bigger mistake 😂 I still don't fully understand what happened.. I made an order that cost more than the amount of cash I had in my margin account? Is that it?

How much $ could I lose here... Ruh roh.

This thing needs to fly past the $21.5 strike price for you not to lose money on this trade in 3 days, and if it doesn't even make it to $21.5 you'll lose it all (your calls will expire worthless).

Also, very important, every day that passes theta will eat away at the premium you can sell them for faster and faster, and you might see that their value still goes down even if the price of the stock slowly moves up to the strike price, so decide quickly if you want to bail or bite the bullet and hold them until they potentially expire worthless.",Notoriolus10,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oaja5q/36k_sofi_72_195c_yolo/h3jldw0/,0.118,0.833,0.048,-0.9129

1080,AMC," Some people day trade it, some people are selling to apes that aren't already fully invested in bags. There are no new buyers, people still playing options are mostly losing due to high premiums. If the stock goes up then bagholders will flee, there is no chance of a squeeze as the short interest is low, liquidity is high, and shorts closed early positions a month ago meaning current shorts are holding averages over $50. Market cap keeps retail investors unable to move the price up. If the stock falls there is no outside interest in buying until it hits single digits besides those who may try to profit off of a bounce. So there is a strong ceiling in the 60s and the floor is under $10 as the actual company wasn't trading at the equivalent of $10 even back when it was profitable five years ago. Streaming services and movie production companies are killing their business. Theaters, like airlines and restaurants, only profit when capacity is very high, and it's not, AMC will likely close some of it's theaters at a loss to move customers to fewer locations to reduce expenses.",BDSBDSBDSBDSBDS,-3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ob11s1/why_amc_is_ready_to_go_rocketmode_very_soon/h3lmod9/,0.084,0.802,0.114,0.7624

1101,AMD," AMD is in the logic gate design industry, NOT manufacturing. 

Intel kept their foundries which is why Intel has worse PE ratios compared to AMD and NVDA. Manufacturing is very capital intensive and low margin (generally). Obviously when they are all running at capacity, margins are great. Capacity is industry secret so nobody will ever know what capacity is and whether anyone is lying. There is basically no reason for foundries to advertise free capacity unless they are stupid. 

TSMC are killing it now though and gaining know how with EUV which is very valuable. Its also a strategically important industry which the Taiwan government will protect at all costs. Probably another reason why the US would go to war if PRC tries to invade. They want to keep China out of this bleeding edge technology. TSMC seem to be pumping chunks into Capex for plants in the US. God knows why they pick Arizona when they need water but hey ho. That said, I think there are better investments than TSMC. More on that later. 

AMD's main advantage is in CPU over Intel in x86. To this day, I cant allocate how much this is due to AMD being better in R&D than Intel vs Intel giving up on EUV with ASML. Either way, Intel screwed up huge and looks to be about 2 years behind in tech. I read somewhere that Intel has got ASML lined up to provide some hardware for Intel in 2023. They may or may not regain competitive products around there since my gut is they prefer monolithic vs chiplet design and they need pellicles for that (yield reasons) and EUV/Pellicles seems to work now. Nothing to concern me for near future but long term, we will need to see what AMD has lined up for 2023 vs new monolithic dies from Intel. Their latest product stack (Emerald Rapids) slipping into 2023 is great for AMD. Still stuck on 10nm. KEK

What the fuck is ASML? They produce the EUV machines for foundries. They have a monopoly on this. All foundries that want to use EUV must buy from ASML. ASML is printing money and cant invest it fast enough so gives dividends. ASML price has gone bananas but its probably still a decent buy imo. Their margins are huge because... they can be. Who else are foundries going to get EUV tech from? Exact entry price? I am going to wait for a small dip and then buy into it. I am late to the party for sure. Applied Materials also a supplier for foundries. No monopoloy like ASML but still very important supplier. 

So why dont I like TSMC as much as ASML and Applied Materials? In the end, they are still a manufacturer. At the mercy of supply demand. Its cyclical. Decent investment but I prefer to invest into monopolies. 

NVDA? Priced too high for my liking but prob just still goes up like TSLA for unexplained reasons. They are KILLING it in GPU and datacentre. AMD exists in this space but NVDA just has the superior tech and mature software stack with CUDA. 

So anyway, whats the TL:DR?

Semi conductor market can only go up imo. Up chunks. Like more than analysts estimate. 

You can capture this better through AMD and ASML than vs Intel (bad tech for now), NVDA (over priced for me but might still just go up). 

I am long AMD. Looking to hold for 10ish years. Maybe this bitch hits 400 a share or something once AMD holds 60% of datacentre CPU.

1108,AMD," i am an AMD fanboy since i started building PCs in the late 90s, and i hold AMD stock for a while now

but remember history... 

AMD was at the top of the CPU world in the early to mid 00s with the K8 CPUs (first 64bit and dual core). they were completely kicking intel's ass in the desktop and server markets. then intel simply pulled some anti competitive shit to undercut AMD with secret deals and rebates with computer manufacturers. AMD won the lawsuits, but the damage was already done.... AMD share price didn't start to recover until the release of ryzen, and then really took off when it achieved meme stonk status.

AMD is winning, and i'm over the moon right now. but i would still be wary of intel",29da65cff1fa,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oazs4f/why_i_believe_in_amd/h3lcapu/,0.126,0.765,0.109,-0.5416

https://imgur.com/LIify0s  
>SKEW is an interesting indicator. Usually ranging from 100 to 150, the former suggests normal perceived market returns and trends toward the latter suggest volatility ahead. Friday SKEW closed at it’s ATH, ~170. While historically it’s not been a good predictor of realized volatility as can be seen in the chart, it’s interesting in that it’s a measure of perceived risk in the markets, basically elevated expectations of a black swan event. So while you probably shouldn’t trade on it, it’s a view into market sentiment for the next 30 days.

Amd is gaining massive ground in the server space. Server stuff moved slow. Amd finally beating into is massive. They are also in Xbox and ps consoles for cpu and GPU.

Nvidia has the best gpus on the market and are market leaders and command prices to match. Nvidia still can unleash their special move of dropping prices if amd ever catches up. The problem with Nvidia to me is they are already too expensive. Imo over valued. But, I still think they will go up.

Intel has fallen far from their perch atop the cpu market but they dwarf AMD in terms of size and budget. I wouldn't touch Intel options though. Intel is years away from coming back imo. I would consider shares but shares only exist on wsb if it's to fuck shorts. Wait a year or 2 then buy leaps in Intel.

That's my opinion. I gave a couple amd shares as disclosure that expire in August. But don't take what I say as financial advice because I'm dumber than a rock at the best of times",usrevenge,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oaxwox/intel_amd_and_nvda/h3l6fmr/,0.074,0.815,0.111,0.7506

1732,TSLA," So you want to point out how everyone should be aware of how the CCP will try and push Chinese EVs over TSLA, and that this will have a material affect, as will an increasingly crowded US EV market, but not willing to short a share or buy a put??

1733,REAL," I understand, you over sold your Atlanta Tesla Service station as being the TITS when in reality they never did any work that required physically replacing any parts. Everything was done with software (same as I can do on all my cars since the early 90's with a laptop). I consider all software diag issues and software update issues as a trivial task, wrenching on a car where you need to take apart the entire dash to get at a stupid sunroof gear because someone engineered a simple issue in a complicated place as being a bonehead product design.

But hey, let me know how it goes when you need REAL service on your car and the TITS service center tells you to go take a flying leap like my friend Ken Sickler @ the Seaside, CA Tesla Service Center. I consider them the ASS not so much the TITS.
