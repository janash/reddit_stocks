6,KBNT," KBNT is still a little under $5. Imo this is a really good deal because this stock took a disproportionate bearing during the recent weeks it has felt. I started buying this at ~$7 or so and have DCAd down since then.

Also I‚Äôm really hoping agtc continues its recovery run. It‚Äôs been nice having good days from it but I still have a little ways to go before it is green again. My avg is 4.50 so it‚Äôs close!

Edit

UEC is so far my best performer today... at 2% lol. A uranium penny stock that doesn‚Äôt get much talk. 3.17 right now is pretty good to have some uranium in your portfolio, I am still buying it personally but I‚Äôm biased because I love nuclear shit

And for non penny shit maxn is down despite getting some great contracts government and private. I suppose because earnings is soon. Solar energy has taken a hell of a beating so with these new contracts and the dip... It‚Äôs a holding I‚Äôm watching most in case anyone may be curious",OurOnlyWayForward,4,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/nhf6oz/daily_discussion_thread/gyxb4cc/,0.127,0.694,0.179,0.8412

16,HUIZ," It is a triple digit growth, single-digit price to sales, Insurance online brokerage, that is positioned itself and the fastest growing insurance marketplace in the world. China insurance marketplace grows at 14 to 16% per year. Compared to the rest of the world 2 to 4% per year. China still has 600 million people not on the Internet, has the fastest growing middle class, it is in a position to reap the rewards of the expenses of that industry. Insurance companies themselves have to pay HUIZ commission. It is a B2B2C biz model. And management Owns about 25 to 30% of the co shares outstanding.

18,RH," RH is just a criminal enterprise. If I were invested in RH, I'd jump ship quick. Fidelity's customer service is amazing.

27,ID," I literally just switched to Fidelity. I suggest you get your account unlocked and do the same.

It's likely because you didn't verify your ID. If you don't have much money in there I would just cut losses and go. Keep the account for when they get sued.
