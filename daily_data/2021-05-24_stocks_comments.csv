24,ALL," This is as simple as it will be.

You contact your institution of choice and tell them you want to talk about managed brokerage accounts. If it is something that they'll ""take over"" on an existing account, they'll typically liquidate ALL your positions and convert everything to cash. You will pay taxes on your gains with this conversion. And then they will open entirely new positions with the available cash and it will be up and running. Paperwork is clearly involved btw. But it's easy and fast.

If you are wanting to open up a brand new account from scratch (like, without any account that already exists with the firm), then you'll typically need to do the manual work to liquidate your positions and transfer the cash into the new account. And then in a day or two, you'll see them take it over and they'll invest all that cash into their ""boiler plate"" tickers based on your risk profile.

Ask them about the 403B. Is that basically a 401k but from a nonprofit (or something like that...?). You'll have to explain your accounts to them and they'll ask you want you want to do. They shouldn't be trying to ""sell"" you anything. They should be straightforward with you. I have Schwab and they've been good so far. I've had other firms manage money before as well. And they are all generally the same tbh. You'll probably be looking at a 1% management fee (meaning they take 1% of your account value every year as payment for their services....so just know that's around the industry standard in terms of management cost).",Don_Julio_Acolyte,0,/r/stocks/comments/nk1757/i_made_my_first_200_dollars_on_the_stock_market/gzb0rwb/,0.014,0.9,0.086,0.9549
25,NIO," People outside China don't realise exactly what they have going on. They have innovative new solutions to range anxiety (hot-swap batteries, provided as a service for example, although some people I tell this to are arguing that no one wants an old battery. They don't seem to realise that you can swap the battery any time you want, since you don't actually own the feckin thing, which also means the initial buying price is more realistic), plus they have good products, probably on par with Tesla, but with less quality issues. Just compare their stock prices and EPS figures. NIO has a lot of room to grow in comparison. They're probably the biggest Chinese EV Co right now, and will be nipping at the heels of Tesla in the next few years.

No, they couldn't. This is why surgical robotic tools are manufactured in Mexico, clothes in Indonesia, drugs in India, and electronics in China. It's not because the mexicans or chinese or indians are better or equally good at manufacturing as the USA.

164,DD," Pretty much everything I've done DD on for them has just been looking up articles and reading up on graphite. I know their biggest backer is The Pallinghurst Group, and their biggest hurdle to production in Canada was achieving a permit for mining which they got a few months back. The Canadian Government have also expressed support for them as well.

My understanding is that something like 90% of the world's graphite currently comes from China but with NMG being based in Canada they would be a far more reliable and affordable alternative to auto-makers in NA. Anodes are one of the four main components of lithium-ion batteries and are made with graphite, and NMG serves not just as a mine for graphite but also a production factory for the anodes specifically for use in lithium ion batteries. 

They have a youtube channel that they have put out a handful of advertisement videos on which are pretty funny and kind of show off the culture/humor that the team in charge has. While I've never contacted them myself my understanding is that the CEO and a few others engage with people on twitter and investor meetings.

They were an OTC stock for a long while until recently, and they just went through a reverse-split which scared a bunch of people away and tanked the price for a while. It was a 10-1 spilt when they were around $1.70/share, and after the split it dropped to as low as $10/share until recovering recently to get back up around $16 before today. I believe the highest I've ever seen it was around $2.05/$2.10 before the split shortly after the permit announcement.

People also point out that technology is changing and the graphite part of lithium-ion batteries, or lithium-ion in their entirety, might change over the next ten years, but the CEO has ensured they have taken such things into account. I also believe there were some protests after they got their permit from a local tribe or something but my understanding is that the tribe doesn't actually live anywhere close to the mining site itself and NMG has been very open and accommodating to them, even offering them employment.

Full disclosure I am pretty new at the stock thing and NMG are the first company I ever really did DD on, and they seem like a pretty good bet and I just got lucky, even if I don't have a huge position in them or anything, at least relative to the kind of numbers I've seen thrown around elsewhere. 

TL;DR, they are basically the number one player in a growing market and offer far more accessibility to that market than the main players in it now. They also market themselves really well and seem to have good people up and down throughout their company. The drawbacks would be jumping in on a stock that is so fresh to a major exchange and still two years or so away from reaching full production, and potential technological changes that might effect their future.

183,IMO," This is the perfect time to load up on Pinterest IMO. You might not see these prices again if the broader macro economic status stays put. I have listened to their last few ER calls  and read their  ER reports and I'm very bullish. Here are my takeaways:

Business is conservative with their Guidance as always, hence the selloff after the last ER call.  BUT they are guiding **105% growth** next quarter

*"".. ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other factors. Our current expectation is that Q2 revenue will grow around 105% year over year. ""*

*""...In Q2, we expect global MAUs to grow in the mid-teens and US MAUs to be around flat on a year-over-year percentage basis.""*

Total revenue was **up 78% y/y to $485M**, steady growth. MAU was 478M, less than 480M expected but it was **up 30% y/y** . This was another reason of selloff, which I think is way more exaggerated.

Pinterest is intentionally slowing the ads shown in order to grow the users. There is a price to pay if you monetize the users too early before the network effect is fully realized. This is the sole reason why Pinterest has low ARPU compared to Snapchat. FB's ARPU is on it's own league so let's not talk about that here. 

 Pinterest has almost double the active users but the market cap is less than half. It's growing faster than Snapchat. They can double from here just by monetizing their current users.

They have not realized their e-commerce potential yet, it has not even started, I think they have just dipped their toe to see how it goes. It will be huge even if their user growth stalls  or even shrinks from current level. They have partnered with Shopify and it has been successful so far. Also as of today they have partnered with IKEA.

Users go to the Pinterest with the intention of shopping and they don't mind the ads. It's the only platform where the ads actually complements what you are looking for. From my own experience I like how I get different full bedroom setups ads with an option to buy.

CEO and founder Ben Silbermann owns around 6% (I think, don't quote me on this) of the shares. I like how founder has heavy skin on the game.  Also I like how the management is executing on the roadmap year after year.

Here is what I'll like to see going forward:  I want to see them go full force on the better social media strategy with inspirations and e-commerce. I like them to partner with more companies like Shopify, IKEA, etc. and also keep on working on the native e-commerce experience. Focus on the growth of e-commerce aspect while slowing down the ads aspect though it's incredibly tough at this moment.

212,DAL," > The odds of the strongest carriers like DAL going bankrupt are very very very low, especially at this point.

You are missing a very key phrase here: **If nothing else goes wrong**

Yes, if nothing else goes wrong the airlines will likely limp along for the next few years and perhaps even start paying back some of the massive amounts of debt that they have accumulated.  The airline industry has been notoriously vulnerable to world events, and they seem to get hit by a bad large scale event every 10 years or so. There are even much more frequent minor events like plane crashes and strikes that can affect their bottom line significantly. There are dozens of things outside of their control that could happen to hurt the airlines industry and very few windfall scenarios that could happen that would actually help them.

Another important fact that I found when digging into their financials is that Delta Airlines book value right now is close to **ZERO**. That means that their liabilities are roughly equal to their assets. If anything goes wrong to tip them off the razors edge that they are balancing on to return to profitability, their creditors are going to come calling. In a best case scenario the shareholders are going to get diluted, in a worst case scenario they could be wiped out.

The final nail in the coffin for airlines at their current valuations is to look at the return on investment potential for these stocks. Even if they were to go back to pre-pandemic levels of business (which is no guarantee) and interest rates stay low, they are looking at much dimmer outlooks because of all the interest they will be paying on the giant piles of debt that they were forced to take on.  Debt isn't necessarily a bad thing when it is being used to expand, but when it has been used just to survive that is a lead anchor that is going to weigh on these stocks for years to come.  Many companies in the past have limped along for decades under large burdens of debt, only to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy during the next big recession.

Even in a best case scenario, the airlines are looking at 5-10 years of pre-pandemic level profits just to repay the debt that they took on in the last year. That is 5-10 years of operating fiscally responsibly with nothing going wrong before an airline can start returning value to its shareholders in the form of dividends or share buybacks. Hopefully nothing goes wrong in that time, because if it does shareholders are going to be the ones feeling the pain.

What I'm trying to say here is that there is a lot of risk (both known and unknown) still associated with airline stocks, and the potential upside/reward is not nearly enough to justify that risk. There are much safer companies to invest in to get similar or better returns than we might expect from an airline company operating in optimal conditions, so there is literally zero reason to throw money at an airline company that has a much higher risk profile.",Visinvictus,2,/r/stocks/comments/njpdhh/are_airlines_undervalued_my_analysis/gza8al5/,0.096,0.794,0.111,0.8714

215,JNJ," I started actually getting into stock stuff this year; up until then I just put money into SPY in an ira I had through my company and thought nothing of it.

I went from ""I don't even look at the market, I just buy SPY when I can"" to manically checking the price of a stock over and over again. I lost roughly $650 chasing trends, had a few days where I felt sick watching money evaporate, and changed my course after a week. I think I have a better relationship with stocks/investments now; I took up blue-chip buy and hold investing, with a focus on dividends and compounding interest, here's a list of all the things I've changed my outlook on, or learned, in the past few months:

1) every penny in the market is ""lost"", I'll never see it again; I don't expect my investments to fail, per say, but I do only invest what I can stomach never using again. Especially this for the fact that I'm expecting to eventually subsist off dividends alone, I don't expect to ever sell what I've bought unless they cut or stop paying a dividend entirely, so that money really will never go back to me in theory.

2) green days are nice, but red days are better. Since I'm buying as holding for the long run, a stock going down in value isn't the worst thing ever; I get to look at the news around why is dropping, if the news is insignificant and the drop seems to be driven by FUD, it let's me buy the stock at a lower price. If there's actually a good reason for the price to drop, it let's me evaluate the stock to see if I want to bounce or not.

3) look at overall values, not day to day. Today a stock investment of mine is down by about 3 dollars, but the total value is up by around 70 dollars. Temporary dips are fine, and worrying about them is foolish.

4) take comfort in an entire market crash; a week or so ago we had a huge correction in the market, I lost a lot of my unrealized gains from it, but I was fine with it. If 1 stock goes down you might worry that it's a bad play. If every stock, either in a sector or across sectors, goes down? That's just a crash, it's not based on fundamentals changing, or problems with my stocks' company, or anything that justifies the stock losing value, it's just a sale.

5) pay attention to the news, but only act on the important stuff. All the previous rules rely on this, if I hear JNJ comes out and says ""it turns out our products cause mega death cancer and also our CEO kicks puppies and orphans for fun. We refuse to apologize and will continue to do this."" That might be a good time to sell; the red day isn't just a regular dip, the fundamentals I trusted changed, the overall values are now important to pay attention to too see the reaction, it's different now, so it's fine to act on it. If you see class action lawsuits or a pipeline gets shafted during planning or some controversy about a training video circulates, it'll be a blip on the company, so don't sweat it. Don't worry about the small stuff, just act on the big issues.",SurfaceToAsh,1,/r/stocks/comments/njmeaw/looking_for_input_on_how_you_have_worked_on_your/gza5rv2/,0.131,0.75,0.118,-0.8558

224,AAPL," Depends on your goals if you want to continue being 100% specialized in a good stock like AAPL or if you want to diversify to minimize risk while still maintaining some exposure to AAPL through an ETF.

Honestly, AAPL is a pretty safe company to invest in because of their increased dividends, massive profits, and growing subscription services which might warrant their higher P/E. I think AAPL is doing the right fundamental changes to their business like the Apple M1 chip to their Mac products, weareables, and growing streaming services like Apple Music and Apple TV. Sure, they might not be as popular as their competitors but Apple is certainly diversifying their influence across their user base to provide more consistent revenue in the future.

I think AAPL is also objectively a long term hold due to their massive influence in most ETFs like the SPY, DIA, and QQQ. Their massive market cap makes it difficult to swing up or down too quickly and should be a stable long-term hold for investors. The fact that AAPL hasn’t done much since August 2020 is actually bullish given the stock could be ready for a massive move upwards since investors could look for opportunities for more upside from Apple in terms of technicals and fundamentals. I believe AAPL’s financials look extremely strong and any more weakness in the stock price will actually lower their P/E ratio substantially to look like a value play for a growth stock.

227,TV," The main reason I continue to hold 90 shares of Apple is I'm a bit worried about a stock market crash and I figure with the $90 billion buy back program, that should protect me from much of the impact of a broader crash. That, combined with the fact the stock is likely to continue to grow, makes it a fairly safe place to store some safety money.

On the downsides, I don't think most people are going to continue to be willing to pay $1000 for smartphones every year when you can get great smartphones for $250 that will last you several years. But people may continue to surprise me.

Also, I feel like I increasingly hear about problems with Apple products that I don't experience with the similar products that cost 1/5 as much. I'm a software developer and very technical so I don't recommend discounting my opinion there.

I don't see how the M1 chip is going to be a game changer when computers are already much more powerful than people need. The processor is almost never the bottleneck anymore, it is usually the hard drive for most tasks or the graphics card for gaming.

Apple TV by most accounts is lame except for Ted Lasso. Apple Music isn't as good as other options.

Will we get a drawdown at some point? Likely IMO but you cant time the top or the bottom so I thinks it's generally wise to just stay long.",steveste1,3,/r/stocks/comments/njm5y9/get_out_or_go_to_sleep_for_now/gz89dzm/,0.051,0.761,0.188,0.9113
261,USA," Are you in the USA or somewhere else like in Europe? In the USA, you can sign up with E*Trade, Interactive Brokers, Schwab etc. etc. or you can get an account with Fidelity or Vanguard. All these allow you to invest in US total market or SP500 index funds without transaction fees.

It sounds to me like you are relatively young and also based on the other things you said, I think you should just keep saving and investing in low cost index funds in a temporally diversified manner (dollar cost averaging). Think about it like this: if you intend to keep investing for a long time, then the amount that you will buy in the future will be much greater than what you have so far. Your current buying so far, will eventually contribute < 10% to your total portfolio in the end (when you're 60+ or whatever). So it really doesn't matter in the long run even if the market crashes from here and stays low for 10 or even 20 years, as long as you stay employed and retain purchasing power to keep buying stocks (also just imagine how much you'd end up earning from dividends alone in a scenario like this).

So that's the baseline. From here, if you want to do anything, I would say start learning (and I mean seriously learning) about investing in stocks. I recommend index funds as a safe way to get started, but you need to get it out of your head that only ""smart professionals"" can make intelligent investments in individual stocks. This topic has been discussed extensively on this forum and elsewhere, but let me just mention that it has been shown that just by mechanically copying Berkshire Hathaway 13Fs and equally weighing their public stock portfolio investments, you would have beaten the SP500 over time. So it is not impossible. In fact it's simple, but it's not easy and your own knowledge of investing and about yourself and your own psychology will determine whether you'll do better or worse than average.

To summarize: don't sell. If you don't know anything, keep buying total market / large cap index funds in a temporally distributed manner. If you want to do better, start learning and studying investment and accept that this will take years (or longer) but that is fine because while you learn, you can keep sitting on your index fund investments.",snake250,2,/r/stocks/comments/njm5y9/get_out_or_go_to_sleep_for_now/gz9t1yp/,0.043,0.869,0.088,0.9457

298,KO," If you're 16 years old you should be investing in things like VOO and VTI.. Long term growth that will yield a lot more, then as you get older you should start taking profits on portions of those and shifting into less risky dividend kings. Right now you can afford some risk in your life, its not like you're gambling away your retirement savings yet.

Also if you want to determine how much you need  to earn 1K a year off of just KO dividends just do the math. Without factoring in growth of dividends or a DRIP strategy you would need to have \~32,900 invested if you bought today.
