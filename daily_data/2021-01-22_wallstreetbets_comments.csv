Then I held it as it bounced between basically a $1 and $1.50 for years because I figured I had nothing to lose and eventually it would rebound because it's a solid company and renewables were the future.

I would watch it move and always considered increasing my position, maybe picking up an additional 5000 shares at a buck, even for a quick flip at $1.50. I don't have a ton of money though, so I didn't want to risk it. I'd just hold onto the shares I had.

As the pandemic started straining my finances, I decided it was time to liquify some things. I sold some stuff I didn't need, and finally said ""fuck it, sell SOL."" It had a little uptick to $2 in Sept that I missed, then fell, then I unloaded it at $1.65 to make a few hundred more than I was used to it being worth at a buck.

And then it started rising. At $4 I said ""welp I missed that boat."" At $8 I said ""welp I *really* missed that boat. At $14 I said ""fuck I missed that rocket."" At $22 I said ""fuccckkkkk *crying* I really missed that rocket.""

Today it hit $35. Basically a 2500% increase in four months, and I dropped the ball literally *days* before it began. A ball I had been holding for years before that. 

I honestly don't know how you guys deal with these kinds of things on a regular basis. Thinking about this easily missed opportunity has been keeping me up at night and generally occupying about half of my thoughts on any given day. 

Maybe this will make you feel better...I think it was good to vent, even if just out into the void.",0.097,0.81,0.093,-0.3134

I used chewy.com for my dog food, it came in the mail bi-monthly. 

I unexpectedly had to put down my best friend. The next day a bag of dog food showed up. I called them explained what happened and asked if they could take it back. 

They told me to donate the bag of dog food and returned the money to my account. Then several days later a vase full of flowers was delivered to my house with a nice personal card. It was from Chewy.com. I cried, hard. I’ll never stop loving them for what they did for me.

We know GME with some major changes has the ability to pivot and make money.  This isn't about the squeeze but saving our childhood gaming stores.  We can do this.

The rocket up in GME and other commonly shorted stocks was a margin call on a fund that was short. By being margin called on gme, they had to buy back the shares sending the price skyrocketing, triggering the halt because of the 10% up in 5 mins rule. 

Buying back their gme shares then triggers their other short positions in a chain reaction of short covering. So why did it go down? They closed their short position, that means those shares are shortable again, and you can bet you ass there was a broker calling a short fund during the stop asking if they wanted the position. 

Nothing has changed, that was the first of many short fund margin calls as gme continues to experience buy pressure based on the renewed business model under daddy Cohen.

376,GME,"That was a margin call The rocket up in GME and other commonly shorted stocks was a margin call on a fund that was short. By being margin called on gme, they had to buy back the shares sending the price skyrocketing, triggering the halt because of the 10% up in 5 mins rule.

Buying back their gme shares then triggers their other short positions in a chain reaction of short covering. So why did it go down? They closed their short position, that means those shares are shortable again, and you can bet you ass there was a broker calling a short fund during the stop asking if they wanted the position.

Nothing has changed, that was the first of many short fund margin calls as gme continues to experience buy pressure based on the renewed business model under daddy Cohen.

I never really intended to buy GME at first... I just didn't really believe in it, too much risk for me. I like to buy stocks that have at least some kind of decent valuations.

Andrew's rant yesterday is what really convinced me to buy in. He just looked like a poor desperate old loser who just cannot understand why he's wrong and talks to himself trying to convince himself he can still get out of this shit.

I almost had pity for him, until he started boasting how big his institution is and how we should fear him for that. Man this guy deserves no pity. He's so used to manipulating the market easily, it makes him truly believe he's entitled to it and can win no matter what Mr. Market says.

Well guess what Andy,  “the markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent”.

If you make WSB private and drop/lose the noobies, then I guarantee most will sell out of fear and lack of encouragement to hold.  This could really blow the front line in the group effort.

If not for the collective DD into GME I would not have invested heavily into GME, which I believe has long term potential. (obligatory: 🚀🚀🚀)

The value of the twitter handle, and how it was being used seems to be a step too far. Are we the next collective group like anonymous? No. But it's easy to create fake sentiment and perception often dwarfs reality.

So the question of what the future holds? I don't think there's much wrong posting gain/loss porn and fanboy meme stocks.

That's not to say you are shielded if you post something that violates SEC / local laws.

His 2020 results were like 155% so he may attract more money.  But who knows.  Apparently he doesn't have to disclose the fund size.  I'm sure if it was big, he'd disclose it.

Again, this was a year ago.  See his prediction on Pelaton which is now at $158

BOSTON (Reuters) - Andrew Left, who has long targeted companies that he thinks are over-valued through his work at Citron Research, told investors on Monday that his new hedge fund returned 43% after fees in 2019, its first year in business.

Left also made a prediction that home furnishing company RH, one of his winners last year, may make a tempting takeover target for someone.

""In 2019, our first full year of operation, Citron Capital, LP (""Fund"") generated a gross return of 56.4% and net return of 43.3%,"" Left wrote in the letter seen by Reuters.

While the fund bet that certain stocks would climb, Left also bet that certain ones would drop, writing ""the Fund's average exposure during 2019 was 75.8% long and 80.3% short.""

Left said that winners on the long side included Bausch Health <BHC.TO>, RH <RH.N>, and Snap <SNAP.N> and on the short side included Ligand Pharmaceuticals <LGND.O>, Jumia Technologies <4JMAy.F>, and Grand Canyon Education <LOPE.O>.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Andrew Left, who has long targeted companies that he thinks are over-valued through his work at Citron Research, told investors on Monday that his new hedge fund returned 43% after fees in 2019, its first year in business.

Left also made a prediction that home furnishing company RH, one of his winners last year, may make a tempting takeover target for someone.

""In 2019, our first full year of operation, Citron Capital, LP (""Fund"") generated a gross return of 56.4% and net return of 43.3%,"" Left wrote in the letter seen by Reuters.

While the fund bet that certain stocks would climb, Left also bet that certain ones would drop, writing ""the Fund's average exposure during 2019 was 75.8% long and 80.3% short.""

Left said that winners on the long side included Bausch Health <BHC.TO>, RH <RH.N>, and Snap <SNAP.N> and on the short side included Ligand Pharmaceuticals <LGND.O>, Jumia Technologies <4JMAy.F>, and Grand Canyon Education <LOPE.O>.

Shittron is a dumb boomer. He probably genuinely believed GME was a good short line lots of other people.  So he's dumb, but not dishonest.

998,GME,"Here's a /r/options kind of tip:You won't make your profits if you exercise, just buy the shares at $35, but you will need the cash to do so. Your shares will be worth the current price of GME (currently $62.05) so your account will instantly have a profit. But then you're subject to the fluctuations of GME. I'd take that profit as cash, maybe put half into more GME if you want, hold some wins, don't fall for the gamblers curse.

Further, the calls still have Extrinsic value. Option price = Extrinsic + Intrinsic. Intrinsic would be (62.05 - 35), and Extrinsic is the value of remaining time. Exercising now will throw away the Extrinsic value, waste of money. Selling will get you the full value, then you can do what you wish with your cash.",0.062,0.711,0.226,0.977

with GME, there were more shorts (borrowed stocks) than actual stocks in existence.  Not really a big deal unless the stonks go up in which case everyone with a short needs to either hang tight and hope it crashes back down or gtfo while they've only lost $1m before they lose $1b.

As all the shorts shitting their pants get out it obviously drives the price up...  especially when there are more shorts than stonks i.e. even cutting your loss becomes harder.

[$109k loss](https://imgur.com/a/E583KGf)

This screen shot is only part of the loss - I was desperate to recoup my losses and started spending the 100k I told myself I would not spend.  

I never recouped that money.  But, it caused me to make a few new rules for myself. For example, I now withdraw money I’m not willing to risk right away. I can always deposit more money into my trading account if I make the intentional decision to do so later on.  Also, a small amount of money is set aside for FOMO adventures, not the majority.  And no weeklies! (unless it’s from my FOMO budget).

Ultimately, I’m still up all time but only a fraction of what I had accumulated at one point.  It sounds like you already have learned a lot from this experience.  You can always take a break, come back in with a small investment (500 or 1k) and start again.

I think you were right to pull out what you could, that’s something I should’ve done back when my investment was being decimated. It hurts to take a loss but I can tell you, I held mine until the end and took a massive loss.  And in hindsight, I would much rather take a 50% loss than 100% loss.  Of course, at the time I kept saying it could still turn around. 

Panicking into another trade to catch up is the emotional response that burned you, and has burned me as well. But that’s why it’s important to establish some trading rules and stick to them. Know what your exit strategy is if things go bad, and if things go well also.  

TLDR - That sucks.  You can come back, slowly and methodically.

It hurts to take a loss but I can tell you, I held mine until the end and took a massive loss.  And in hindsight, I would much rather take a 50% loss than 100% loss.  Of course, at the time I kept saying it could still turn around. 

Panicking into another trade to catch up is the emotional response that burned you, and has burned me as well. But that’s why it’s important to establish some trading rules and stick to them. Know what your exit strategy is if things go bad, and if things go well also.  

TLDR - That sucks.  You can come back, slowly and methodically.

I found it was a tricky game because it's difficult to distinguish the signal from the noise. How much was due to your edge vs due to luck? It can take a lot of trading to sort that out, and is **especially** risky over the long-run if you're a net-buyer of options. The data I have seen show that options sellers come out ahead in the long-run, although it's obviously a slower and less glamorous journey.

Also, the shorter the timeframe, the harder it is: the more of an edge you need, the more the commissions eat into your bottom line, the more time it takes, the more your mental health suffers, and the more disciplined you need to be.

Don't get me wrong, there are people who successfully day-trade, but I'm not one of them. I think what the whole GME episode illustrates is that quality > quantity.

The data I have seen show that options sellers come out ahead in the long-run, although it's obviously a slower and less glamorous journey.

Also, the shorter the timeframe, the harder it is: the more of an edge you need, the more the commissions eat into your bottom line, the more time it takes, the more your mental health suffers, and the more disciplined you need to be.

Don't get me wrong, there are people who successfully day-trade, but I'm not one of them. I think what the whole GME episode illustrates is that quality > quantity. I suspect most people are probably better off doing a lot of DD and going with the top 1-2 choices and avoid the mistake of being over-diversified.",0.067,0.854,0.079,0.3965

That's why the dream for many retirees has been to get enough dividend-paying stock (e.g. AAPL) to pay living expenses, and you can live tax-free (qualified dividends are taxed at the same rates as long-term capital gains). Also when you compound the value of tax-free investments, it simply does not compare.

Consider also  /u/DeepFuckingValue and the value of leaps. If he purchased his leaps before 1/15/20 (i.e. 1 year prior to expiration), then the \~$2.7 million he made will be taxed at long-term capital gains rates. At the federal level, he's looking at the difference between a 37% marginal tax-rate (ord income) and a 20% marginal taxrate (LT cap gains). That amounts to a difference of roughly $459,000.

And of course, he also has GME shares he hasn't sold yet. That's even better from the tax perspective, because he can effectively defer taxes on those gains for as long as he holds those shares. In other words, he doesn't get a tax bill until he decides to sell. (Whereas with options, you are forced to have a realized gain or loss by expiry, even if you rolled them to a later expiry.)

So as boring as it, the best tax-minimization strategy is buy and hold. You can still sell covered calls in this situation, as long as your shares aren't called away (in which case, you'd be forced to realize a gain/loss). You could avoid this however by buying-back any covered calls before they go in-the-money, although even if they do it's not likely your shares will be called prior to expiration.",0.058,0.814,0.128,0.959

Where the last peak happens is hard to guess. It's completely up to the company and institutional holders to decide when they're happy with it.

The company's valuation at a fair comparison to its peers could be anywhere between $100 and $200 without a squeeze, so I can see that as a bottom and the squeeze pushing way beyond that.

So if someone shorted on margin, the broker can force them to buy back the shorts to close their position.  When the broker does this, if no one is selling GME at ""market price"" then they will have to go to limit orders.  The closer limit price is to market price, those will be chosen first.  Now imagine that everyone either sets no limit price, or if they do set a limit price, it is for $500/share or more (just a scenario).  When the broker forces the short sells (margin) to close, they will have to buy whatever they can, even if the lowest limit price they can find is $500/share, they have to buy it to close out the short.

VW short interest was 12.8% and GME is over 100%. Hedge funds lost $30 billion covering just 12.8%. What do you think 100% covering with an estimated 6 days to cover based on stock circulation will look like.

12.8% is only the tip of the iceberg on why VW squeezed

>Prior to October 2008, Porsche alone had already controlled 30% of VWs shares.  Next, the government fund of Lower Saxony (the home province of VW in Germany) owned an additional 20% of VW as a strategic stake.

>In addition, various index funds owned around 5% of VW due to VWs large weighting in the DAX index.  These index funds were required to hold VW in proportion to its weight in the DAX, such that they would not be able to sell simply due to changes in the price of VW.  Volkswagen alone made up 17% of the DAX index at the time.

>Looking at the above, it is clear that heading into October of 2008, around 55% of VW shares were already unavailable in the market for any realistic purposes.  As a result, when Porsche increased its stake by an additional 44%, it meant that the true available float went down from 45% of outstanding shares to around just 1% of outstanding shares.  Suddenly the seemingly “low” short interest of 12.8% turned in to a massive supply and demand imbalance.  Millions of shares needed to be bought immediately even though there were simply no shares available to be sold.

collectible growth is bananas and the margins are better than systems and games combined.

E-commerce was already growing before Covid and they were already withholding popular skus from stores to sell straight to people’s homes.

This did hurt stores and will end up closing quite a few, and while it sucks for employees it will reduce their overhead by a lot by reducing payroll and shipping costs. My god did we get sometimes an entire UPS truck full of stuff that will never sell, mall leases are too expensive to work as a warehouse.

The company definitely wants to restructure around esports and gaming lounge type stores, it just requires so much cash that the company never had laying around, and the demand for the social aspect of gaming could be so much more and GameStop already has the physical locations to make cool events like local tournaments or just social gaming experiences.

None of this should be new information as it’s been a consistent trend in their earnings reports and press releases, but between the GameStop nostalgia and their actual gaming market share they could just pull off something really cool if the boomer leadership would stop forcing warranties as the holy grail.",0.058,0.803,0.139,0.9664

I don't think if it's just confirmation bias, but I plan to play GME in both the short and long term.  In the short term I've sold cash covered puts after dips to milk that crazy 200-300% IV and if a massive squeeze becomes evident I'll sell my shares.  Long term I do plan to buy shares if a pullback occurs.  My biggest fear is if GME issues new shares, but if they're limited to $100mil I don't think it'll make much of a difference.

What rumors. There was the EV platform rumors but that’s all. EV have sensors so sure. Automation as in self driving? Sure but QNX IVY isn’t about self driving and would be very late to the game if it was. So industrial automation?

Sources. Links. Spacex - for what ? QNX rocket?  Zoom? For what? Data integrity when it already has a China backdoor? Qualcomm? For what ? 


BB has worked with some gov historically but specifically on what? 


Sony partnership. Cool. Sony doesn’t make cars. They made 1 and said they weren’t selling it. BB also gets $5 a car fee. 


> This all depends if $BB is capable of hiring great salespeople to execute on their job. Only time will tell.

Nobody wants to work there. They have lots of job postings for that reason. Would you rather work at BB and get paid less $ and get worthless options or work at GOOG and get valuable options and paid more $? 


The way I see it is it potentially was overlooked and revenue is growing. That’s the only possibility for it’s up value to be real. 


Stocks are overlooked all the time. 


Maybe no profit last 4yr because reinvesting and research expenses etc. and accounting write downs (non cash). But cash flow from ops is also negative I think, or not great. 


EV or not, car sales are probably not spiking any time soon so nothing changed on the sales front for BB IVY, unless these new deals are guaranteed revenue. We’d have to know their details. 


Tech price to sales is 5-10x. MSFT is at 10 P/S. Is BB on par with MSFT? 

BB was at 3-4 P/S and now is at 7.5 P/S which is more reasonable for them. (TTM - trailing 12mo) (https://ycharts.com/companies/BB/ps_ratio)


P/S doesn’t factor in growth of the future. If sales growth then the ratio will go down unless the stock goes down.


 If we can confirm based on the items above that BB sales will increase (which, without the details to confirm it I would argue yes; how much, unknown) then there is room for BB price to increase. 


BB price is fair to increase a bit from its current price as well to perhaps 8.50x P/S. That would put the stock at $14.11. 


Throw in some growth there and in a year it wouldn’t be unreasonable to see **$18.43 share price. **

I'm asking because QNX is the dominant (by far) OS in current vehicule with more than 50% of the market and their partnership with new EV manufacturer is extensive.

The whole point of Ivy and this Amazon partnership is them entering the IoT and Big Data fields... To develop self driving vehicules, you need large amount of data and a cloud connected service like Ivy will allow for real time feedback about the cars, the weather or the driver. That is pointed out in official info releases. Again, not super difficult to find...

And like you said... 2020 revenue was up. Revenue mainly based on automotive software was up during a year where car sales went down 22%.

This was very unlikely, or so the call option seller thought. So to ""entice"" someone to buy that contract, the call seller made the premium be $0.0577 per share. So 1 contract = 100 shares. 98 contracts = 9800 shares. 9800x0.0577 = $565. 

So OP spent $565 for the right to buy 9800 shares of GME at $60. 

Again, the contract seller thought he'd make a pretty penny on a 1- day contract. If it skyrocketed to just $59.99, that entire $565 would be down the drain for OP. And of course, the seller keeps that $565 anyway. 

I'm sure the seller thought he'd offer a bunch of those calls and then make easy money on premiums.

Then it went up to $69. Well above the strike price of $60. So those contracts went up in value because he has the right to buy from the seller at $60 then immediately sell at $69.

Call: buy shares at a set price (higher than current market price, but lower than what you predict the price to be). Purpose: to speculate and gain if price goes up.

Put: sell shares at a set price (lower than current price, but higher than what you predict it will be). Purpose: hedge against your shares going down.

Keep in mind there's more purposes.

When you sell a call: You are guaranteeing to the call buyer that you will sell to him at the strike price. If you have the shares already, that is called a covered call. 

You keep the premium you sold the call for. Your loss is your shares you must sell. And if the difference between the strike price you agreed to and the new higher price is large, you lose 'implied' money, or whatever.

If you don't have the shares already, that's called a naked call. Your possible loss is unlimited. Because you must buy back the shares to sell them to the call buyer. If it goes from $40 to $60 like today, that's a huge loss if you sold 100 contracts (10,000 shares you must buy).

When you sell a put: you are guaranteeing to the put buyer you will BUY his shares at that lower than current price. Here, the limit of your risk is if the stock goes to $0. In which case you must buy stock from him at the strike price even though the stock is worth nothing.

So max loss on buying calls: Premium 
Max loss on buying puts: Premium
Max loss on selling covered call: Stock you own 
Max loss on selling naked call: unlimited cuz you must buy back stock at whatever price.
Max loss on selling put: Big but limited cuz stock can only go to $0. 

Also, this doesn't factor in the stock movement. For example, the movement of the stock may counter the gains/losses on your options, and vice versa. Like if you own stock and want to hedge against it going down, you can sell a covered call at very high strike price b/c you think it won't get hit. Then you collect a premium for that. Even though the price of the stock you own went down, you gained a little bit through premium.

2473,AIG,"The capital of $500+

Calls are like leveraged trading except instead of having a loss proportional to price movement downwards, your loss is capped. 

The tradeoff is that it cuts both ways because if it doesn't hit the strike price ($60) within the day, you lose all your capital, whereas in regular leveraged trading you'd still likely make money

Think of calls as an insurance premium, the guy is selling an insurance to OP that OP can claim only if the stock hits $60, and claim he did. Just like AIG selling insurance on derivatives during the GFC",0.09,0.85,0.06,-0.4819

AGL Linux is already a competing open platform with significant buy-in from the major car manufacturers. QNXs advantages over it are that it’s real time and you can sue QNX when their software makes a mistake. I doubt QNX is actually more secure than Linux because nobody is trying to hack QNX at scale yet. 

If AGL can get regulatory approval and momentum, then QNX becomes the thing that runs on the critical components only. AGL already has Audi, Ford, Toyota, Nissan, Mercedes and Honda on board. Tesla is already running their own Linux. 

If QNX increases prices which are currently $4/vehicle that could make a lot more money, but they could also lose their market share to AGL if they get too greedy. 

Could QNX win? Yes. Will this skyrocket their revenue? My guess is not 12x. They’d have to massively increase market share to get to $100B, and they’ll need to take a huge chunk of the revenue from car manufacturers who are ahead looking pretty stingy.

My earlier guess about how much QNX needs to grow was actually wrong, estimates are QNX is 1/5th of BB revenue, so they need to grow revenue by 60x to reach your price target (excluding the rest of BBS offerings).

As far as traders failing due to luck. When something like black Monday happens. Or the mortgage crisis of 2008. If you’re in the market and either aren’t aware of or not knowledgeable about the overall conditions that were there for everybody to see that a huge bubble had formed, I tend to disagree that it’s bad luck. If you’re in the market on the precipice of a huge bubble or an election or a huge piece of news or during political instability, that’s not exactly bad luck to suffer from said bubble popping. You are in the game, ignorance of macro conditions and the fall out of blatant moral hazard is not an excuse. If i had a huge position in Exxon and BP, is it bad luck if joe Biden outlaws fossil fuels with an executive order and I lose big? I think not, considering he has said we need to get off fossil fuels. If I didn’t know that, it’s not bad luck. The information is out there.",0.159,0.663,0.178,0.5224

Taking advantage of that luck is reading that post, taking it with an open mind (rather than laughing about it being Blockbuster or whatever), doing your own DD, putting your money in it early, and then holding with confidence in your thesis.

I wanna know where OP or professor Taleb thinks the hard work ends and the luck begins? Is it the fact that the price went to $65? Was I lucky when it hit $8? At the end of the day I applied my skills and my experience to make an informed decision on a stock that I found should increase in value, which it did. What’s the luck? Am I lucky the CEO didn’t get hit by a car? Am I lucky hydrogen wasn’t made illegal? Somebody explain the luck part.

The one thing Andrew Left seems to miss completely is Ryan Cohen's mission to turn Gamestop into a Chewy. In simple words: make it primarily e-commerce and focus on customer experience/journey optimalisation. He didnt even mention that Ryan and two (three?) other Chewy Chads joined the management board in his video, just that RC is an investor but not the influence he has. The source he mentioned in the video about the $20 target (HedgeyRetail) even replied that they have switched expectations to $100+ value with the Ryan Cohen turnaround and without counting in a potential squeeze ([https://twitter.com/HedgeyeRetailJM/status/1352384990542229504?s=19](https://twitter.com/HedgeyeRetailJM/status/1352384990542229504?s=19)).

Jokes aside, I think of all the rebuttals I’ve seen to his video, this puts the best counter-points out there. The only hiccup is the revenue. 

Numbers were still not as good as they should’ve been, but weren’t bad. The Lemon is right to point out that the numbers don’t support the rise in valuation. But you’re absolutely right that he is still thinking GME is going to be brick and mortar... after Ryan Cohen came on board and literally blasted management for not pivoting to e-commerce. What a dope. 

Oh yeah and also they have a good amount of cash on hand (500M) so they aren’t going under anytime soon.

In case y’all want some numbers:

Based on that snapshot of GME
quick ratio is 0.50
current is 1.05

Industry averages for retail trade (2019)
quick: 0.32
current: 1.10

**Their D/E is pretty bad though, depending on what Ryan wants to do to turn the company around I can see them issuing that 100 million. EPS and other metrics wouldn’t be as affected at these prices.

the .5 multiple you mentioned would imply we could see 800/share if being valued as venture with a 10x if we are at .5x - which doesn't seem sustainable for GME but maybe as an end goal a couple years away

So then what about from point #1 where you mentioned the megathread stating to hold through a squeeze...what effect does that have on price post squeeze if most folks hold? Little to no price drop I assume.

Citron mentioned their $25 estimate in his video, saying that was *if* they meet HedgeEye's estimated revenue and that was unlikely.

RC has more money than he could possibly ever spend and a dog he's happy with. GME isn't just an investment for RC, it's his project. He will put a lot into this to turn this around because he'd be bored if he retired. He could just play gold all day, hedge his wealth and live in his mansion but those are boomer dreams. He wants to get shit done. 

He even mentioned RC's letter, then complained that Sherman hasn't implemented it and that the leadership is still the same so GME will stay a retail business with no future. Technically RC is not in the board of directors yet but that's like saying ""Today the sun will stay up. It has been up since this morning and still not gone down, I'm betting it will stay up. And the closer it gets to the horizon then I'll bet even harder.""",0.113,0.768,0.119,0.4606

2. That is a valid point. Until GME or Cohen release any actual plan for this digital transformation we don’t know where they stand. One thing that was floated by both Cramer and Left is that GME could capitalize by offering new shares at this high price in order to pay down debt or expand the business. This is a legitimate possibility that could mess this up for everyone, but I would like to think Management has an understanding of the situation? I actually don’t think an additional offering is a bad idea, but if they let this squeeze to $100 first they can make double the $$

Really think it's a good buy, I don't give a shit if it trades sideways, people are going to sell, they see a huge return and decide to dump them, that's their loss, keep the chump change. In it to fucking win it.

So he finds someone who owns stock X (brokers) and says, let me sell your stock today, and I’ll pay an agreed interest on what they are worth.  later, when the price of Stock X drops, I’ll re-buy them back and give them back to you.  Short dude profits the difference between the initial sell and the re-buy minus the interest paid.  broker profits the interest and still has his position of stock X at the end.  If the stock never drops, short dude has a tough decision to make, hold out longer and hope it eventually drops or re-buy at the higher price and close the position.  At some point, it’s possible the broker says to the short dude, you done fucked up, close the position now (margin call).  If the short dude is a hedge fund or someone with mucho $$$, the broker will never force close their position and that hedge fund will continue to report some tiny (relatively) ongoing interest charge until they change their thesis and close the position, or until the stock drops.  I know Melvin are the bad guys in our story but they have been making bank on shorting GME over the years (look at a 5yr GME chart) so they have so much inertia behind their thesis, a couple weeks of pop from the internet autists is unlikely to force them to close.

It's a pipe-dream WSB can be responsible for 20-45 USD price action and 50-144m of daily volume. GME was discovered here, but now it's a fistfight between the sharks. WSB on the other hand serves a useful role of a scapegoat in boomer narrative, hiding impotence of their financial advice.

We also don't know plans of GME management in that space, similarly MMs or different market participants agenda is unknown and that's just a tip of the iceberg. So if you're in for these sweet short-term gains, effectively you're making bet on an unpredictable phenomenon (roaring kitty stream discuss squeeze quite often) that can reward your greatly but may or may happen.

Long term wise, if you think a stock that has doubled in 2 weeks has only upside from now on, oh boy the market will have a surprise for you.  Thus far we are winning but what does future hold? Sherman/RC devastating power? Unexpected share dilution? Lower than expected console allocation? None of us is a prophet.

GME is a turnaround story in the making - there are plenty of transformational risks ahead of RC in a very competitive market, hence is hard to assess if $45 a fair price that will only go up. I like the bull thesis but things do not always work out do they?

GME is probably one of the more high-risk reward investment I've seen. Low risk would be Microsoft or Apple, not a struggling retailer on a verge of achieving profitability after 3 years of loses. Nevertheless I wouldn't score 100% gains in two weeks with low risk stocks, would I? Also, truth to be told - bear thesis seems to largely misguided at this stage but still has its merits. Otherwise GME wouldn't be most shorted stock in history (I think). If RC doesn't pull off his digital transformation vision, GME is indeed fucked when current console cycle ends. Stock price will steadily decline in such scenerio.
