I would watch it move and always considered increasing my position, maybe picking up an additional 5000 shares at a buck, even for a quick flip at $1.50. I don't have a ton of money though, so I didn't want to risk it. I'd just hold onto the shares I had.

As the pandemic started straining my finances, I decided it was time to liquify some things. I sold some stuff I didn't need, and finally said ""fuck it, sell SOL."" It had a little uptick to $2 in Sept that I missed, then fell, then I unloaded it at $1.65 to make a few hundred more than I was used to it being worth at a buck.

And then it started rising. At $4 I said ""welp I missed that boat."" At $8 I said ""welp I *really* missed that boat. At $14 I said ""fuck I missed that rocket."" At $22 I said ""fuccckkkkk *crying* I really missed that rocket.""

Today it hit $35. Basically a 2500% increase in four months, and I dropped the ball literally *days* before it began. A ball I had been holding for years before that. 

I honestly don't know how you guys deal with these kinds of things on a regular basis. Thinking about this easily missed opportunity has been keeping me up at night and generally occupying about half of my thoughts on any given day.

I used chewy.com for my dog food, it came in the mail bi-monthly. 

I unexpectedly had to put down my best friend. The next day a bag of dog food showed up. I called them explained what happened and asked if they could take it back. 

They told me to donate the bag of dog food and returned the money to my account. Then several days later a vase full of flowers was delivered to my house with a nice personal card. It was from Chewy.com. I cried, hard. I’ll never stop loving them for what they did for me.

We know GME with some major changes has the ability to pivot and make money.  This isn't about the squeeze but saving our childhood gaming stores.  We can do this.

The rocket up in GME and other commonly shorted stocks was a margin call on a fund that was short. By being margin called on gme, they had to buy back the shares sending the price skyrocketing, triggering the halt because of the 10% up in 5 mins rule. 

Buying back their gme shares then triggers their other short positions in a chain reaction of short covering. So why did it go down? They closed their short position, that means those shares are shortable again, and you can bet you ass there was a broker calling a short fund during the stop asking if they wanted the position. 

Nothing has changed, that was the first of many short fund margin calls as gme continues to experience buy pressure based on the renewed business model under daddy Cohen.

376,GME,"That was a margin call The rocket up in GME and other commonly shorted stocks was a margin call on a fund that was short. By being margin called on gme, they had to buy back the shares sending the price skyrocketing, triggering the halt because of the 10% up in 5 mins rule.

Buying back their gme shares then triggers their other short positions in a chain reaction of short covering. So why did it go down? They closed their short position, that means those shares are shortable again, and you can bet you ass there was a broker calling a short fund during the stop asking if they wanted the position.

Nothing has changed, that was the first of many short fund margin calls as gme continues to experience buy pressure based on the renewed business model under daddy Cohen.

I never really intended to buy GME at first... I just didn't really believe in it, too much risk for me. I like to buy stocks that have at least some kind of decent valuations.

Andrew's rant yesterday is what really convinced me to buy in. He just looked like a poor desperate old loser who just cannot understand why he's wrong and talks to himself trying to convince himself he can still get out of this shit.

I almost had pity for him, until he started boasting how big his institution is and how we should fear him for that. Man this guy deserves no pity. He's so used to manipulating the market easily, it makes him truly believe he's entitled to it and can win no matter what Mr. Market says.

Well guess what Andy,  “the markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent”.

I always thought of WSB as about 10% sharp options traders that were simply board, and this gave them a place to vent & joke around, because options trading is incredibly stressful. Now that # is significantly less. GME hit, but what % of WSB can even explain the theory behind a short squeeze?

If you make WSB private and drop/lose the noobies, then I guarantee most will sell out of fear and lack of encouragement to hold.  This could really blow the front line in the group effort.  Not everyone fully gets it, but the hype and excitement is getting new investors to even go buy 5 or 10 shares.

If not for the collective DD into GME I would not have invested heavily into GME, which I believe has long term potential. (obligatory: 🚀🚀🚀)

The value of the twitter handle, and how it was being used seems to be a step too far. Are we the next collective group like anonymous? No. But it's easy to create fake sentiment and perception often dwarfs reality.

So the question of what the future holds? I don't think there's much wrong posting gain/loss porn and fanboy meme stocks.

That's not to say you are shielded if you post something that violates SEC / local laws. Everyone should remember that they can type whatever they want, but others can respond to that in more ways than just hitting reply...

I believe the biggest threat to WSB comes from blatant disregard of collusion / inflammatory speech (which will become more regulated).

Even from when I first browsing WSB about 2-3 months ago to today there's been an exponential increase in what some view as ""spam"" posts regarding a single topic (i.e., GME). In recent days I have seen (I think) an attempt to control that by focusing the majority of that content to a single thread. I feel that is the right approach. The real challenge is to make sure users do not directly or indirectly violate any SEC laws / regulations.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Andrew Left, who has long targeted companies that he thinks are over-valued through his work at Citron Research, told investors on Monday that his new hedge fund returned 43% after fees in 2019, its first year in business.

Left also made a prediction that home furnishing company RH, one of his winners last year, may make a tempting takeover target for someone.

""In 2019, our first full year of operation, Citron Capital, LP (""Fund"") generated a gross return of 56.4% and net return of 43.3%,"" Left wrote in the letter seen by Reuters.

While the fund bet that certain stocks would climb, Left also bet that certain ones would drop, writing ""the Fund's average exposure during 2019 was 75.8% long and 80.3% short.""

Left said that winners on the long side included Bausch Health <BHC.TO>, RH <RH.N>, and Snap <SNAP.N> and on the short side included Ligand Pharmaceuticals <LGND.O>, Jumia Technologies <4JMAy.F>, and Grand Canyon Education <LOPE.O>.

After investing only his own wealth for roughly two decades,Left in 2018 began laying the groundwork for Citron Capital, his hedge fund. By raising outside capital, Left has more firepower to go after some of the biggest U.S. companies.

Citron has not disclosed the size of its hedge fund.

For this year, Left said RH, whose stock price closed at $212.77 on Monday, may be bought. ""We believe the company has matured to a point that we might see it acquired in 2020.""

**He also said he is sticking by his bet that shares in Peloton Interactive, whose stock closed at $29.75 on Monday, will fall. ""Citron put a one-year price target of $5 and we stand by it as $5 makes this still a $1.5 billion company.""**

Neither RH nor Peloton responded immediately to emails seeking comment.

Left also gave investors lessons that he learned last year; reminding himself and others to stay away from what he calls ""big story 'cult stock'"" companies and sticking with what he does best: exposing fraud.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Andrew Left, who has long targeted companies that he thinks are over-valued through his work at Citron Research, told investors on Monday that his new hedge fund returned 43% after fees in 2019, its first year in business.

Shittron is a dumb boomer. He probably genuinely believed GME was a good short line lots of other people.  So he's dumb, but not dishonest.

1001,GME,"Here's a /r/options kind of tip:You won't make your profits if you exercise, just buy the shares at $35, but you will need the cash to do so. Your shares will be worth the current price of GME (currently $62.05) so your account will instantly have a profit. But then you're subject to the fluctuations of GME. I'd take that profit as cash, maybe put half into more GME if you want, hold some wins, don't fall for the gamblers curse.

Further, the calls still have Extrinsic value. Option price = Extrinsic + Intrinsic. Intrinsic would be (62.05 - 35), and Extrinsic is the value of remaining time. Exercising now will throw away the Extrinsic value, waste of money. Selling will get you the full value, then you can do what you wish with your cash.",0.062,0.711,0.226,0.977

You cannot say “Cohen can make it translate” because Chewy is same product/like product on a monthly subscription base whereas GameStop customers are not having FIFA21/Madden21/ insert any video game delivered on a monthly basis.

[$109k loss](https://imgur.com/a/E583KGf)

This screen shot is only part of the loss - I was desperate to recoup my losses and started spending the 100k I told myself I would not spend.  

I never recouped that money.  But, it caused me to make a few new rules for myself. For example, I now withdraw money I’m not willing to risk right away. I can always deposit more money into my trading account if I make the intentional decision to do so later on.  Also, a small amount of money is set aside for FOMO adventures, not the majority.  And no weeklies! (unless it’s from my FOMO budget).

Ultimately, I’m still up all time but only a fraction of what I had accumulated at one point.  It sounds like you already have learned a lot from this experience.  You can always take a break, come back in with a small investment (500 or 1k) and start again.

I think you were right to pull out what you could, that’s something I should’ve done back when my investment was being decimated. It hurts to take a loss but I can tell you, I held mine until the end and took a massive loss.  And in hindsight, I would much rather take a 50% loss than 100% loss.  Of course, at the time I kept saying it could still turn around. 

Panicking into another trade to catch up is the emotional response that burned you, and has burned me as well. But that’s why it’s important to establish some trading rules and stick to them. Know what your exit strategy is if things go bad, and if things go well also.  

TLDR - That sucks.  You can come back, slowly and methodically.

It can take a lot of trading to sort that out, and is **especially** risky over the long-run if you're a net-buyer of options.

1396,GME,"Yes! That's why the dream for many retirees has been to get enough dividend-paying stock (e.g. AAPL) to pay living expenses, and you can live tax-free (qualified dividends are taxed at the same rates as long-term capital gains). Also when you compound the value of tax-free investments, it simply does not compare.

Consider also  /u/DeepFuckingValue and the value of leaps. If he purchased his leaps before 1/15/20 (i.e. 1 year prior to expiration), then the \~$2.7 million he made will be taxed at long-term capital gains rates. At the federal level, he's looking at the difference between a 37% marginal tax-rate (ord income) and a 20% marginal taxrate (LT cap gains). That amounts to a difference of roughly $459,000.

And of course, he also has GME shares he hasn't sold yet. That's even better from the tax perspective, because he can effectively defer taxes on those gains for as long as he holds those shares. In other words, he doesn't get a tax bill until he decides to sell. (Whereas with options, you are forced to have a realized gain or loss by expiry, even if you rolled them to a later expiry.)

So as boring as it, the best tax-minimization strategy is buy and hold. You can still sell covered calls in this situation, as long as your shares aren't called away (in which case, you'd be forced to realize a gain/loss). You could avoid this however by buying-back any covered calls before they go in-the-money, although even if they do it's not likely your shares will be called prior to expiration.",0.058,0.814,0.128,0.959

The company's valuation at a fair comparison to its peers could be anywhere between $100 and $200 without a squeeze, so I can see that as a bottom and the squeeze pushing way beyond that.

When the broker does this, if no one is selling GME at ""market price"" then they will have to go to limit orders.  The closer limit price is to market price, those will be chosen first.  Now imagine that everyone either sets no limit price, or if they do set a limit price, it is for $500/share or more (just a scenario).  When the broker forces the short sells (margin) to close, they will have to buy whatever they can, even if the lowest limit price they can find is $500/share, they have to buy it to close out the short.

VW short interest was 12.8% and GME is over 100%. Hedge funds lost $30 billion covering just 12.8%. What do you think 100% covering with an estimated 6 days to cover based on stock circulation will look like.

12.8% is only the tip of the iceberg on why VW squeezed

>Prior to October 2008, Porsche alone had already controlled 30% of VWs shares.  Next, the government fund of Lower Saxony (the home province of VW in Germany) owned an additional 20% of VW as a strategic stake.

>In addition, various index funds owned around 5% of VW due to VWs large weighting in the DAX index.  These index funds were required to hold VW in proportion to its weight in the DAX, such that they would not be able to sell simply due to changes in the price of VW.  Volkswagen alone made up 17% of the DAX index at the time.

>Looking at the above, it is clear that heading into October of 2008, around 55% of VW shares were already unavailable in the market for any realistic purposes.  As a result, when Porsche increased its stake by an additional 44%, it meant that the true available float went down from 45% of outstanding shares to around just 1% of outstanding shares.  Suddenly the seemingly “low” short interest of 12.8% turned in to a massive supply and demand imbalance.  Millions of shares needed to be bought immediately even though there were simply no shares available to be sold.

I don't think if it's just confirmation bias, but I plan to play GME in both the short and long term.  In the short term I've sold cash covered puts after dips to milk that crazy 200-300% IV and if a massive squeeze becomes evident I'll sell my shares.  Long term I do plan to buy shares if a pullback occurs.  My biggest fear is if GME issues new shares, but if they're limited to $100mil I don't think it'll make much of a difference.

What rumors. There was the EV platform rumors but that’s all. EV have sensors so sure. Automation as in self driving? Sure but QNX IVY isn’t about self driving and would be very late to the game if it was. So industrial automation?

Sony partnership. Cool. Sony doesn’t make cars. They made 1 and said they weren’t selling it. BB also gets $5 a car fee.

Nobody wants to work there. They have lots of job postings for that reason. Would you rather work at BB and get paid less $ and get worthless options or work at GOOG and get valuable options and paid more $? 


The way I see it is it potentially was overlooked and revenue is growing. That’s the only possibility for it’s up value to be real. 


Stocks are overlooked all the time. 


Maybe no profit last 4yr because reinvesting and research expenses etc. and accounting write downs (non cash). But cash flow from ops is also negative I think, or not great. 


EV or not, car sales are probably not spiking any time soon so nothing changed on the sales front for BB IVY, unless these new deals are guaranteed revenue. We’d have to know their details. 


Tech price to sales is 5-10x. MSFT is at 10 P/S. Is BB on par with MSFT? 

BB was at 3-4 P/S and now is at 7.5 P/S which is more reasonable for them. (TTM - trailing 12mo) (https://ycharts.com/companies/BB/ps_ratio)


P/S doesn’t factor in growth of the future. If sales growth then the ratio will go down unless the stock goes down.


 If we can confirm based on the items above that BB sales will increase (which, without the details to confirm it I would argue yes; how much, unknown) then there is room for BB price to increase. 


BB price is fair to increase a bit from its current price as well to perhaps 8.50x P/S. That would put the stock at $14.11. 


Throw in some growth there and in a year it wouldn’t be unreasonable to see **$18.43 share price. **

Tech price to sales is 5-10x. MSFT is at 10 P/S. Is BB on par with MSFT? 

BB was at 3-4 P/S and now is at 7.5 P/S which is more reasonable for them. (TTM - trailing 12mo) (https://ycharts.com/companies/BB/ps_ratio)

 If we can confirm based on the items above that BB sales will increase (which, without the details to confirm it I would argue yes; how much, unknown) then there is room for BB price to increase. 


BB price is fair to increase a bit from its current price as well to perhaps 8.50x P/S. That would put the stock at $14.11.

The whole point of Ivy and this Amazon partnership is them entering the IoT and Big Data fields...

This was very unlikely, or so the call option seller thought. So to ""entice"" someone to buy that contract, the call seller made the premium be $0.0577 per share. So 1 contract = 100 shares. 98 contracts = 9800 shares. 9800x0.0577 = $565. 

So OP spent $565 for the right to buy 9800 shares of GME at $60. 

Again, the contract seller thought he'd make a pretty penny on a 1- day contract. If it skyrocketed to just $59.99, that entire $565 would be down the drain for OP. And of course, the seller keeps that $565 anyway. 

I'm sure the seller thought he'd offer a bunch of those calls and then make easy money on premiums.

Then it went up to $69. Well above the strike price of $60. So those contracts went up in value because he has the right to buy from the seller at $60 then immediately sell at $69.

But mostly people just chose to sell the contract itself. But it's all timing. Now the price is $58.",0.015,0.871,0.114,0.9551

But since OP bought the calls, his maximum loss is just the premium he paid, which was $565. Which is criminally low. 

When you buy an option, you pay a premium for the RIGHT to do something:

Call: buy shares at a set price (higher than current market price, but lower than what you predict the price to be). Purpose: to speculate and gain if price goes up.

Put: sell shares at a set price (lower than current price, but higher than what you predict it will be). Purpose: hedge against your shares going down.

Keep in mind there's more purposes.

When you sell a call: You are guaranteeing to the call buyer that you will sell to him at the strike price. If you have the shares already, that is called a covered call. 

You keep the premium you sold the call for. Your loss is your shares you must sell. And if the difference between the strike price you agreed to and the new higher price is large, you lose 'implied' money, or whatever.

If you don't have the shares already, that's called a naked call. Your possible loss is unlimited. Because you must buy back the shares to sell them to the call buyer. If it goes from $40 to $60 like today, that's a huge loss if you sold 100 contracts (10,000 shares you must buy).

When you sell a put: you are guaranteeing to the put buyer you will BUY his shares at that lower than current price. Here, the limit of your risk is if the stock goes to $0. In which case you must buy stock from him at the strike price even though the stock is worth nothing.

So max loss on buying calls: Premium 
Max loss on buying puts: Premium
Max loss on selling covered call: Stock you own 
Max loss on selling naked call: unlimited cuz you must buy back stock at whatever price.
Max loss on selling put: Big but limited cuz stock can only go to $0. 

Also, this doesn't factor in the stock movement. For example, the movement of the stock may counter the gains/losses on your options, and vice versa. Like if you own stock and want to hedge against it going down, you can sell a covered call at very high strike price b/c you think it won't get hit. Then you collect a premium for that. Even though the price of the stock you own went down, you gained a little bit through premium.

Calls are like leveraged trading except instead of having a loss proportional to price movement downwards, your loss is capped.

2528,BB,"BB/QNX is already in millions of cars, more than 50% of the market, why is this materially different to the tune of >12x growth?

AGL Linux is already a competing open platform with significant buy-in from the major car manufacturers. QNXs advantages over it are that it’s real time and you can sue QNX when their software makes a mistake. I doubt QNX is actually more secure than Linux because nobody is trying to hack QNX at scale yet. 

If AGL can get regulatory approval and momentum, then QNX becomes the thing that runs on the critical components only. AGL already has Audi, Ford, Toyota, Nissan, Mercedes and Honda on board. Tesla is already running their own Linux. 

If QNX increases prices which are currently $4/vehicle that could make a lot more money, but they could also lose their market share to AGL if they get too greedy. 

Could QNX win? Yes. Will this skyrocket their revenue? My guess is not 12x. They’d have to massively increase market share to get to $100B, and they’ll need to take a huge chunk of the revenue from car manufacturers who are ahead looking pretty stingy.

If you’re in the market and either aren’t aware of or not knowledgeable about the overall conditions that were there for everybody to see that a huge bubble had formed, I tend to disagree that it’s bad luck. If you’re in the market on the precipice of a huge bubble or an election or a huge piece of news or during political instability, that’s not exactly bad luck to suffer from said bubble popping. You are in the game, ignorance of macro conditions and the fall out of blatant moral hazard is not an excuse. If i had a huge position in Exxon and BP, is it bad luck if joe Biden outlaws fossil fuels with an executive order and I lose big?

""I know, everyone on reddit is a genious and every trade is a win"" - Has he ever heard about GOURDS? Never have I seen people posting with such a pride that they were willing to risk everything for a better life and they may have lost everything but at least they gave it everything they had. And everyone here claims or is retarded so it's hard to get that even more wrong.


""We're not in the middle of a short squeeze, the shorts are still very high"" - bitch how is that an argument to not go long?!? The borrowing fees are low _for GME standards_! It's still at 30% per annum. If your credit card provider raised their fees to 30% you'd probably try to sue them, boomer! And the stock being heavily shorted has always been one reason to go long. The shorts will eventually have to cover and probably lost over one billion dollars by now. At some point they will cut their losses and I don't give a damn if GME has the right to sell stock for 100m USD. That's diluting the share value by less than 5%, we gained over 10% today so that's nothing. 


""RC holds 9m shares, he could sell them! Even if the shares went to 0 he'd be richer than me or you!"" Well the last part is right but that boomer doesn't understand how this works. RC has more money than he could possibly ever spend and a dog he's happy with. GME isn't just an investment for RC, it's his project. He will put a lot into this to turn this around because he'd be bored if he retired. He could just play gold all day, hedge his wealth and live in his mansion but those are boomer dreams. He wants to get shit done. 

He even mentioned RC's letter, then complained that Sherman hasn't implemented it and that the leadership is still the same so GME will stay a retail business with no future.

2. That is a valid point. Until GME or Cohen release any actual plan for this digital transformation we don’t know where they stand. One thing that was floated by both Cramer and Left is that GME could capitalize by offering new shares at this high price in order to pay down debt or expand the business. This is a legitimate possibility that could mess this up for everyone, but I would like to think Management has an understanding of the situation? I actually don’t think an additional offering is a bad idea, but if they let this squeeze to $100 first they can make double the $$

They have some great partnerships in the works, and you might think of them as something like MS was to hardware in the 90s when it comes to big data and automotive.  

One example - if TSLA is like Apple - a company that wants to build their own hardware and software so that everything is tightly integrated, and if it's difficult for a hardware company to simply ""get good"" at software (it is), then it makes a lot of sense for a company like BB to step in and fill that void.

150 million cars have embedded the QNX platform now.  So if TSLA gets to self-driving by having a lot of their own cars on the road, imagine how much quicker these companies can get there using collective data mining from ALL the cars they're making.  

Right now - they're making use of QNX for other purposes - but the software is already there.  The connectivity and interoperability and the _contracts_ are there.  For a company that's good at software, it's a simple thing to build more functionality to support new needs.  For a company that's good at hardware, you just keep making good hardware and win customers as you always have.

Recall that MS rose to prominence because Gates and Co. saw a path to making great software that worked on any hardware - while these hardware companies were trying to make their own software suites to compete with each other.  Only Apple really survived in the PC space (you could argue Sun went the distance, perhaps you can argue it for IBM and Oracle, though I think they were players in hardware / software to different degrees).  

There are some big challenges that need solving in the next decade.  For the automotive space, TSLA isn't going to solve those challenges for all drivers.  Mercedes isn't going away.  Toyota isn't going away.  There are entire cities in Germany where I haven't seen anything else but BMWs.  So who is going to step in and augment those companies with software expertise?

My post was viral, hit the top of WSB. The twitter account was created a day after I warned that they would try and portray WSB as a coordinated group of manipulators, and the twitter account started tweeting dodgy stuff and basically said it had control over the markets. After all this shit I decided to write an expose in WSB. Now, the Melvin shillers are trying to call it fake when the mods said it was true. Other mods who supported the twitter account got my post taken off WSB and all other subreddits related to finance.",0.082,0.861,0.057,-0.7311

So he finds someone who owns stock X (brokers) and says, let me sell your stock today, and I’ll pay an agreed interest on what they are worth.  later, when the price of Stock X drops, I’ll re-buy them back and give them back to you.  Short dude profits the difference between the initial sell and the re-buy minus the interest paid.  broker profits the interest and still has his position of stock X at the end.  If the stock never drops, short dude has a tough decision to make, hold out longer and hope it eventually drops or re-buy at the higher price and close the position.  At some point, it’s possible the broker says to the short dude, you done fucked up, close the position now (margin call).  If the short dude is a hedge fund or someone with mucho $$$, the broker will never force close their position and that hedge fund will continue to report some tiny (relatively) ongoing interest charge until they change their thesis and close the position, or until the stock drops.  I know Melvin are the bad guys in our story but they have been making bank on shorting GME over the years (look at a 5yr GME chart) so they have so much inertia behind their thesis, a couple weeks of pop from the internet autists is unlikely to force them to close.

We also don't know plans of GME management in that space, similarly MMs or different market participants agenda is unknown and that's just a tip of the iceberg. So if you're in for these sweet short-term gains, effectively you're making bet on an unpredictable phenomenon (roaring kitty stream discuss squeeze quite often) that can reward your greatly but may or may happen.

Long term wise, if you think a stock that has doubled in 2 weeks has only upside from now on, oh boy the market will have a surprise for you.  Thus far we are winning but what does future hold? Sherman/RC devastating power? Unexpected share dilution? Lower than expected console allocation? None of us is a prophet.

GME is a turnaround story in the making - there are plenty of transformational risks ahead of RC in a very competitive market, hence is hard to assess if $45 a fair price that will only go up. I like the bull thesis but things do not always work out do they?

GME is probably one of the more high-risk reward investment I've seen. Low risk would be Microsoft or Apple, not a struggling retailer on a verge of achieving profitability after 3 years of loses. Nevertheless I wouldn't score 100% gains in two weeks with low risk stocks, would I? Also, truth to be told - bear thesis seems to largely misguided at this stage but still has its merits. Otherwise GME wouldn't be most shorted stock in history (I think). If RC doesn't pull off his digital transformation vision, GME is indeed fucked when current console cycle ends.

At the end of the day, what PLTR offers is more sweet than freedom, more safe than safety, bigger than bigly, and more comprehensive than could be comprehended.

Data. There's a lot of it. 

What Palantir delivers is the ability to fly a metal balloon over a dessert and minority report all the Jihad Johnnys before they can get their Sambas on. It's the ability to move oil like you're playing Chutes and Ladders but its all ladders and you'll get shot if you fuck with the flow.

Data. Big fucking data. Dark pools. Money. Cost savings. Aggregation. Predictive analytics.
