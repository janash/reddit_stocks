0,GDP," You’re absolutely right. Inflation isn’t going to hit that fast. 

However, for people challenging the notion that inflation isn’t real out there. We increased the money supply drastically. 

The difference between now and 2008-2010 when we used quantitative easing, was the velocity of money. When the fed increased the money supply banks were stingy at first, but once they started loaning out money, people spent it incredibly fast. Money supply increased but soo did velocity. That didn’t happen this past year, money supply only increased and velocity has stayed the same, if not decreased from pre-pandemic. 

There’s an argument to be made. That once this economy opens. GDP is going to be massive. Sparked by the massive amount of money supply, but ignited by how fast the dollars are spent(velocity). I could easily see our economy shaking off a lot of inflation worries with an amazing few quarters.

3,IMO," Inflation will take time. While the money supply was boosted roughly a year ago, the money has not been spent. Household savings rates hit record highs.

Once things fully reopen, people travel, etc, that's when inflationary pressures really kick in. But even then, it will take months before a surge in consumer demand actually leads to higher prices. Historically inflation is not instant.

I think the real difference between the stimulus now vs stimulus during/after the GFC is that during the GFC there weren't supply pressures, whereas during covid there has been a significant impact to supply. So whereas during/after GFC there was spare capacity for stimulus to boost the economy, during Covid we've seen scarcity of just about everything. First it was toilet paper and food, now it's semiconductors.

IMO all the leading indicators for inflation are lining up. Rising treasury yields, higher inflation expectations, shortages, rising commodity prices.",skilliard7,0,/r/investing/comments/m1ynqd/the_cpi_report_didnt_just_reduce_fears_of/gqh5irp/,0.05,0.893,0.057,0.2732

For inflation to pick up in a meaningful and sustained way, there HAS to be demand that can not be easily met.

This part is probably true, and I get why a bunch of people working retail/entry level service industry jobs making <$20/hr frame their economic analysis as such.

But there's also an enormous bias on Reddit for people working in IT and software engineering, where the salaries are pretty good. Where I always run into trouble is in failing to square why a bunch of people who presumably make at least middle-class incomes also believe the 'CPI is fake' junk. My current theory is that the people in IT/software also tend to be disproportionately left-leaning, so there's some sort of pride in appearing to be woke to the plight of the poor.

11,GDP," So I mean the first problem is YouTube is a terrible place to learn about these concepts.  It's usually just some random person offering their unqualified thoughts on something they probably learned via YouTube videos or reddit comments. 

CPI, and inflation, is necessarily an average.  So like saying ""CPI is a bad measure because Education has risen faster than CPI"" is the same as saying ""The S&P 500 is a bad measure of the market, because TSLA has risen much faster"".  Sure, TSLA has risen faster, but there are a ton of stocks that have risen slower - and with inflation nobody sits there and talks about deflation in auto costs, in consumer goods, flat inflation in grocery until recently, etc.  Just focusing on the top end of the average is not a good way to discuss averages. 

Also, many people like to pick apart certain aspects of CPI based on either misunderstandings or just bad faith interpretations.  Here's a great piece if you have the time, I promise you'll understand more about CPI than 99% of this sub if you read this: https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2008/08/art1full.pdf

Also, CPI isn't the only measure of inflation.  There's PCE which is measured and calculated by an entirely different entity and uses an entirely different methodology.  There is also the GDP deflator which works by measuring GDP in last year's prices.  All of these tend to track very closely to each other.  To make an analogy, if someone told you a ruler was inaccurate, but you checked the measurement with three other devices and it came out roughly the same would you still think the ruler inaccurate?

OP explained their moat, at least partially, but didn't seem to realise they did it. PLTR works with big companies with huge and complicated data analysis needs. Implementing something that meets those needs can potentially take 6 months or more. The PLTR strategy is to target the biggest, most complicated customers and effectively install the software for free, only properly charging the customer once the software is up and running. This creates a niche in the market and a massive price barrier for competitors. Its also why PLTR is going to take a while for its revenue to get up to speed.",Nemisis_the_2nd,16,/r/investing/comments/m1nu6b/the_case_for_palantir_technologies/gqfqr7d/,0.016,0.859,0.126,0.9209

50,PLTR," There seem to be a few reasons for the discrepancy. I would say the complete opposite of you and think he biggest that snowflake could just be massively overvalued. With the same number of shares available PLTR would be struggling to break $140/share.

* PLTR has 1.47Bn shares outstanding, compared to snowflakes 220Mn.

* Snowflake has competition that PLTR doesn't have, thanks to its focus on cloud-based data storage over integrating into customer computer systems. 

* Snowflake also appears to go for the easy contracts while ignoring the whales. Basically the opposite of PLTR.

* Because of the previous 2 points, Snowflake will likely have higher initial revenue, but in a much more saturated market and competing against industry giant's like Google and Microsoft. This could hurt their revenue in the future. 

* By focusing on whales, PLTR creates an effective moat for itself, with the high cost of taking on a customer creating a steep barrier for competition to pass before taking them on. Snowflake has a much smaller moat for reasons already mentioned. 

* PLTR has more experience and this seems to show. Before Snowflake was even an idea, PLTR were playing Minority Report for the US military in Afghanistan and Iraq.

* There also seems to be the sentiment that PLTR simply provides a much more user-friendly and effective service, which can go a long way.",Nemisis_the_2nd,10,/r/investing/comments/m1nu6b/the_case_for_palantir_technologies/gqftnit/,0.05,0.837,0.113,0.9135

72,USA," >yields are rocketing on inflation expectations

You don't even need inflation. Currently Real Yields are negative (10y breakeven inflation - 10y yield). This is rather unusual from a historical perspective, so the 10y rising another % or two, could be considered simply a regression to the mean.

Also I doubt the Fed will Act on inflation **Expectations** but only actual inflation. They even already stated that they would let actual inflation stay above 2% for some time, so that it averages to 2%. And they believe that this inflation is likely transient anyway. Whether that will be the case remains to be seen.

>Is that not the exact opposite of what they should do?

They have a dual mandate of low inflation and low unemployment. So what they should do, especially in a stagflationary scenario is not really clear, even on paper. I think they already indicated that they would put more emphasis on the unemployment part going forward.

And while the Fed may be independent on paper, that does not mean it is immune from politics/public sentiment. After all congress can always pass a new law and change the fed, as they did with the unemployment mandate.


Right now everyone wants more spending, more stimulus, etc. I expect that this sentiment will only change once the pain of inflation outweighs the benifits of keeping the party going, which will probably take some time. In essence, I expect that the can will be kicked down the road for as long as possible. How long that will be, depends on a number of things, and is arguably next to impossible to predict.

Lastly, there is also a historical example of the fed doing exactly this, namely the yield curve control during and following WWII. Nominal yields were kept very low, while inflation hit double digits. This was of course to inflate away the war debt. Whether something similiar will be done with the ""corona war debt"" remains to be seen. The USA, and most western countries for that matter, were in a very different situation back then (demographically for example).",Leetle_Monkey,6,/r/investing/comments/m1nxdy/stimulus_bill_treasury_bond_sale/gqfqv7e/,0.135,0.841,0.024,-0.9922

90,WMT," Bought a few hundred shares of the stock a year ago, not sure if it was a wise (bull) investment as it hasn't kept up with the market.

As a frequenter of Walmart, the establishment and online sales, they have problems:

* The purchase of whatever company they decided to manage their online shopping experience
* Lack of payments experience
* App design (I keep having to select 'retailer ... Walmart')
* Lack of fulfillment in the store, sometimes >1 hour wait
* Employee satisfaction
* Lack of management direction (heard the VP give a speech 2 Novembers back in SF)

So sorry, but I am not bullish on this stock.  They have several problems and issues regarding their management, employees and technology stack.

Edit:  I paid attention when some folks from India educated me about how markets (retail) operate in India, along with product delivery.  This mostly pertained to the payments area.

98,NAV," They're interesting (especially after 2020) but I agree with others most people shouldn't bother with such vehicles.

If you buy company stock you're already buying a leveraged vehicle (provided the company has any debt). Very different things but similar enough to if a company has its borrowings called, say, in disaster, which happens to financial entities. Companies can usually manage leverage ratios. This fund cannot--at all.

I do find CEFs to be interesting. Many of them also use leverage or even issue preferred shares. Drawdowns can be hard (see PTY), but the good ones recover and track NAV closely enough. With the added benefit of very high yields after the drawdown which you can take advantage of. I'm more comfortable with that than a leveraged ETF.",ThemChecks,-1,/r/investing/comments/m1hspa/a_case_for_leveraged_etfs/gqed5o9/,0.049,0.749,0.202,0.9698
99,MSCI," It does have something to do with leverage actually.

Sure, you could argue that a more volatile index or stock would suffer from the same problems. And that's partially true. But what mathematical decay refers to, is the fact that levered up daily returns will *always* cause decay relative to the underlying unlevered benchmark. This isn't true for just any high-beta stock or index. Why? High-beta stocks or indices are usually not perfectly correlated with well-diversified indices. In other words, the daily return of the MSCI IT doesn't equal 1,5 times the daily return of the MSCI USA just because the beta of the MSCI IT would be 1,5 (I mean, that isn't even how beta works but let's apply it like that). This is because the MSCI IT is not perfectly correlated with the MSCI USA.

In the end, higher volatility stocks don't even necessarily have a higher beta. When they have low correlations to the underlying index, their beta's could be lower than 1, even though they are way more volatile.

The decay thing should be seen as ""decay relative to the underlying unlevered index"". 

I get what you are trying to say though, but decay is a real thing. And even if decay applies to more volatile stocks in the same way that it does to leveraged, well-diversified indices, it's still a problem that also specifically relates to applying daily leverage. At the end of the day, the leveraged index will show decay relative to the unleveraged alternative.",ChengSkwatalot,4,/r/investing/comments/m1hspa/a_case_for_leveraged_etfs/gqfdnsv/,0.154,0.815,0.031,-0.9864
100,MSCI," I wouldn't advise to leverage investments in indices like the NASDAQ 100 or the MSCI IT. As I state in my original post, it is crucial to lever up in a well-diversified index or portfolio.

142,GME," Why did it go down, an attempt to drive the share price down was made - and failed?

If you check out iborrowdesk for GME, you'll see that the amount of shares capable of being borrowed to sell short has decreased slowly over the past few days to weeks.

Today, iborrowdesk / GME indicated over 350,000 shares available at market open (3-10-2021.9:00).  At market close yesterday (3-09-2021.16:00), there was nearly more than 850,000 shares available.

Right now, (3-10-2021.16:00) we are seeing 150,000 shares to borrow.  That means more than 700,000 shares could have been borrowed to try and short the stock, driving down the price since yesterday.

As fewer shares are available, such attacks become rarer.  As more shares are available at low rates, the (my) expectation of fluctuation remains high.

146,GME," While leadership changes and short interest is helping drive the stock, they are NOT the main reason for the stock price going up

GME is experiencing pattern after pattern of gamma squeezes. It's a actually a very simple trend to follow. At each multiple of 50, there's anywhere from 50k to 100k options that are suddenly ITM. MMs are hedging, which means shares are being bought as options come closer to being ITM. Thus, a gamma squeeze. For example, resistance today at 300, then once it breaks through, it immediately shoots up to 330, and reestablishes a new resistance. There'll be a new resistance at 350, which if it breaks through, will send it to 370+ very quickly, and so on

Just look at yahoo fiancee option chains for expirations dates for 3/12 and 3/19. There are 10s of thousands, most strike prices closer to 100 thousand, of options at these strikes. The price action is actually very easy to see. You can see the intraday gamma squeezes resistances and then squeezes all the way back when GME was fighting resistance at 130, and then 150, and then 200

Edit: Now, the reason everyone bought these options in the first place was due to the short-interest, which has been hypothesized to still be high, and some of these options now might have been hedges by short-sellers and MMs",UncleZiggy,7,/r/investing/comments/m1ymyl/gme_thread_wednesday_march_10th_2021/gqgrxou/,0.029,0.926,0.045,0.5859

[https://www.icm-mhi.org/en/pressroom/news/colchicine-reduces-risk-covid-19-related-complications](https://www.icm-mhi.org/en/pressroom/news/colchicine-reduces-risk-covid-19-related-complications)

showed that Colchicine (gout medication) had a significant effect on reducing/reversing covid-19 symptoms. The study was released in January this year and at the time TAK was trading in the mid $18.00. TAK in the same range today. A subsequent study by the Quebec Government published early February this year found the initial Colchicine study lacking in its disclosure, TAK continued to trade in the $17-18 range:

In mid February The Government of Alberta and Government of Canada gave approval in for a Colchicine trial in Calgary:

It's hard to say where this will end up. Colchicine is getting attention. TAK Pharmaceuticals owns URL Pharmaceuticals whom currently have the rights to Colcrys in the United State. Colcrys is a brand name of Colchicine Gout medication. TAK has been moving up in the last week on daily morning buys. There are also many articles on the value Colchicine in fighting heart disease. I don't mean to tie the movement of TAK to Colcrys and the Gout situation, TAK is a big company. This is a small piece of a large company that has some global potential.

SPTM can be relatively stable, not buying and selling stocks often, which means almost all gains are unrealized. On the other hand, for VTI to continue tracking the CRSP, it has to adjust its portfolio year over year, which means stocks are sold and therefore realized.

217,DD," So, before I get into my ideas, I'm going to recommend some educational resources for you incase you need them. So first is investor.gov, which has a great getting started section, aswell as being all round a great website for investing ""safe"", next is investopedia, which is like the Wikipedia for investing, but also as a great education section full of great articles. Finally the one I recommend the most is khan academy, which has some really spectacular videos on all things related to the stock market. Ok so now for my ideas, what I would do is split your money (not necessarily evenly) between three different stocks/ETFs, so the first one would be your stable stock/ETF, (example VOO)where you just set it and forget it. Next is your dividend one, where it should be sort of stable but with high dividends (example VYM), and now with your new found dividends I'd reinvest back into your stable and the following. The following is what usually is a individual stock, but could be an etf. So the following would be something that you really believe in, something that you think is undervalued and will grow. This doesn't necessarily have to be 100% safe, as you have your stable stock and to a extent your dividend stock to rely on. So an example would be Sony, which is a company I feel really passionate about on which I  made a DD that I can share wit you if you would like. So , in summary, my strategy would be a very low risk etf, low risk dividend stock/etf and sort of risky stock/etf which you believe will grow faster than your stable and the market in general.

But from all this factual information that you and I are not aware of, they deduce an insane fantasy conclusion.

261,ACB," #**When is Adjusted Closing Balance calculated for Roth IRA excess contribution earnings withdraw?**

**Short version:**

Can someone help me find a source for when the Adjusted Closing Balance (ACB) for earnings on excess Roth IRA contributions are calculated? None of the examples I can find online are specific enough to answer what I’m looking for.

**Long version:**

I’m trying to understand the scenario in which I make my $6,000 Roth IRA contribution in January and then later (let’s say April) become ineligible to contribute to a Roth IRA (due to increased income from, say, a new job that pays more). If I realize it sooner than later, can I calculate ACB now (March) and fix the excess contribution and associated earnings then? Or do I have to wait until tax filing to calculate ACB and to fix the excess contribution earnings?

To put some numbers on it and make it a more concrete example:

-	1-Jan-2021 - Roth IRA balance is $24,000 (of which $18,000 is contributions)
-	2-Jan-2021 - Contribute $6,000 for 2021
-	1-Mar-2021 - Accept new job that pays more and will make me ineligible to contribute to a Roth IRA
-	xx-Mar-2021 - Roth IRA balance $40,000

So if I understand correctly...

-	Excess contribution: $6,000
-	Adjusted Opening Balance (AOB): $30,000
-	xx-Mar-2021 Balance (ACB?): $40,000
-	Earnings on excess: $6,000 x ($40,000 - $30,000) / $30,000 = $2,000

Can I withdraw $8,000 today and be in the clear? (If so, will it all be considered coming from “contributions”? Or will I have to pay income taxes on the $2,000 that was from earnings from the excess contribution?)

Or... do I have to wait until the end of the year to calculate my ACB? (And then pay taxes throughout the entire year on whatever earnings I make?)

I simply cannot find this information anywhere!

265,GME," > It is obvious that GMEs price is not backed by any reasonable sort of fundamentals, and is being driven by froth

Some buyers of GME actually believe the company can pivot to an E-Commerce model of some sort and carve out a market share big enough to justify a $15B valuation. So I would say that while most of the price appreciation is driven by meme hype, many shareholders are actually in for the value. Whether that has any chance of materializing is up for debate.

> My question is, when does a stock like this correct itself?

You might as well ask a magic 8 ball this question. Stock hype can keep prices elevated quite a while.

> What type of event would cause the plummet? I just don’t see how that would happen if everybody is just continuing to buy. Months, maybe even years.

Several earnings reports in the future that don't show the company successfully transitioning into their new business model would have an effect. A fizzle out of the hype could cause a fall as well. You're correct, if retail investors keep buying en masse, the stock will stay priced high.

> Actually good stocks are making a fraction of the movement that meme stocks like GME are. Not rooting either way, but I’m just curious.

So first is investor.gov, which has a great getting started section, aswell as being all round a great website for investing ""safe"", next is investopedia, which is like the Wikipedia for investing, but also as a great education section full of great articles. Finally the one I recommend the most is khan academy, which has some really spectacular videos on all things related to the stock market. Ok so now for my strategy, what I would do is split your money (not necessarily evenly) between three different stocks/ETFs, so the first one would be your stable stock/ETF, (example VOO)where you just set it and forget it. Next is your dividend one, where it should be sort of stable but with high dividends (example VYM), and now with your new found dividends I'd reinvest back into your stable and the following. The following is what usually is a individual stock, but could be an etf. So the following would be something that you really believe in, something that you think is undervalued and will grow. This doesn't necessarily have to be 100% safe, as you have your stable stock and to a extent your dividend stock to rely on. So an example would be Sony, which is a company I feel really passionate about on which I  made a DD that I can share wit you if you would like. So , in summary, my strategy would be a very low risk etf, low risk dividend stock/etf and sort of risky stock/etf which you believe will grow faster than your stable and the market in general.

286,IRS," I am not an accountant but I'm pretty sure this can get tricky fast if you trade heavily in the same stock.  The IRS has Publication 550 as a resource for calculations.  Generally, the method used for stock transactions (as opposed to bonds that are way different) is FIFO.  The key here is stock owner is responsible for this calc and being sure it's accurate. Each buy/sell needs to be carefully tracked using this method.  Again not an accountant, but as I understand the wash rule, your question above regarding XYZ stock would produce a gain of +$10.  The IRS wants the tax on the gain, but you can't write it down the gain with the loss due to the wash rule.  You have to track each purchase lot individually and offset by the subsequent sale (FIFO).",Mommafed,1,/r/investing/comments/m1u6jc/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gqgnvqp/,0.031,0.786,0.183,0.9773

Fact is, if you go through the SEC presentation, you'll notice that they don't really have that much going for them. And that is why the market is valuing them at 6x *current* revenue.

295,PH," Will dig a little deeper. I’m fairly bullish on the Canadian miners at the moment BITF, HUT.TO and HIVE. They are all severely undervalued when compared to riot and Mara. 

Numbers are from January: 

“RIOT had about 830 bitcoins in its treasury at last count, and a current mining capacity of 842 PH/s (petahashes/second), while Hut 8 has 3007 bitcoins in its own treasury at last count and a current mining capacity of 1031 PH/s.”

Hash rate vs market cap (Argo is included there as well)

296,ARGO," Well I know RIOT actually lose money on mining whereas ARGO have 80% margins currently which are increasing month on month.

I'm not sure on their current debt but they do keep it low. There is an argument they would be better taking more debt on to buy more BTC but I don't think that's what you want from a long term investment.

I think from memory they own around 500 bitcoin but they bought 170 of them.

They keep their produced bitcoin but they do pay salaries with it.

298,POW," Well thats part of the reason I wouldn't invest in BTC directly but don't forget that Bitcoin is projected not be completely mined until 2140 and I expect prices to keep rising for the next few years at least. 

Investing in bitcoin miners is a safer bet as they switch to different crypto currencies relatively easily. 

If there's a complete move away from POW currencies in however many years time, that could be problematic but again that's why I'm more comfortable with Argo as I could see them diversifying into a computational data center of some kind a bit like coreweave did at the start of the pandemic.
