So do your own DD. I just can't make up my mind on this one. I'm leaning towards it being a Pump and dump.

You 5 preexisting businesses involved, an accountant firm, lawyer firm, PR firm, Core state holdings, and now an investor relations firm.

This is a businesses decision, civil liability decision and a criminal liability decision. If they are found to have participated in a criminal enterprise they stand to lose on all three fronts. 

Is it possible, yes but IMO very unlikely. Each time you fold in a new criminal partner you risk exposing yourself and the others to investigators.

Robotic Assistance Devices Publishes Case Study Regarding Security and Cost Savings at Client Citrus Construction
Henderson, Nevada, March 15, 2021 — Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions, Inc., (OTCPK:AITX), today announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary Robotic Assistance Devices (RAD) has published a case study featuring RAD’s client Citrus Construction, a subsidiary of The Richman Group, the seventh largest rental apartment owner in the US. This case study outlines how the deployment of RAD’s ROSA has had a positive impact on the company’s job sites. Greg Van Haute, Vice President at Citrus Construction states “…we’re paying a fraction of what we were paying before. More importantly, we’ve seen a drop in crime”.

Construction companies, property managers and contractors are repeatedly plagued by the costly and dangerous instances of theft, vagrancy and trash dumping on their active job sites and properties. RAD’s ROSA is a breakthrough in autonomous security devices, complementing and at times outright replacing traditional security guards. “ROSA is doing the same or better than having a security guard in place,” Van Haute concluded.

“This case study is absolute validation towards everything that we have built into the RAD ecosystem,” said Steve Reinharz, President and CEO of RAD. “The cost savings and enhanced security profile that Citrus Construction is experiencing with just a few ROSAs is what we envision for every business, large or small.”

The Richman Group has indicated that they plan to share these successful results with its 100+ managed residential properties and their other construction projects. “RAD is just scratching the surface of the massive US construction market. There is so much potential in the construction services industry, and we expect that ROSA and the other RAD solutions will be warmly received as they were with Citrus Construction,” Reinharz concluded. According to Statista, in 2020, new construction in the United States was valued at just over $1.36 trillion.

Hello, I am not able to post DD so I will try this comment:

I just want to share with one company what I found. I found a few before and after a feew weeks I saw a post about them, so I want to share this one with you in advance.

**Water Ways Technologies Inc. (WWT.V)**

Company provides water irrigation solutions to agricultural producers in Israel and internationally.

Why I invested into WWT:

low amount of outstanding share: **89.59M**  
low float: **36.15M**

(Basic rule: more shares less probability of price grow /demand supply effect)

Tradable company just since 2019.

ATH: 0,26 (to be honest not interesting)

They keep cca. 60% of stock inside of company.

They generate profit - they have real product and real customers

219,SP," One of the easiest mistakes a penny investor can make is confusing ""potential"" with reality. The reality is that if SNPW really had this much potential, there would be a bunch of other co's doing the same thing. Obviously there are a ton of other solar companies. The med recyling thing is not nearly as simple or cost effective as they try to make it seem. The bus shelters are their best product so far, and obviously that has limited range as far as growing the company goes. There are others in the outdoor advertising/solar fixtures space as well. As others have said, they have a bunch of debt and hype, but not much real to show yet.

Did you read who the CEO is friends with and what the Secretary of Commerce job is?

221,LAWS," Just 20 of the pyrolsis plants will be $1B revenue.  That would be a 10x revenue trading.  The lease they have on the plant in RI is 20 year.  Assuming the leases will be similar or the same.  That will be a $20B in revenue.  At $50m revenue per plant for 20 years.  Then you have patents on solar that are cheaper, lighter and stronger than the rest.  Not sure what the market size for solar sound barriers and solar highways but I can safely assume its over $1B.  Then you have the solar panel bus shelters that will be used for data mining and use blockchain technology for state/federal security uses. Again, part of the secretary of commerce job.  If you see the amount of money Gina has to work with to enforce through law it favors every single aspect of this company.  Look at the budgets for commerce.  Multiple sectors the secretary of commerce handles.  One in particular you can look at is the REGULATORY LAWS budget.

224,NEXT," 200 a week is 800 a month and 10400 a year. Honestly, don't waste it on pennystocks. Take secure ETFs or similar that show an average growth of 10% a year.

I won't go into annoying math that takes max weeks - current week x 10%, so I'll just use 10400 per year.

I will use year 0 as first year where you pay in 10400 and not apply 10% to it.

After 30 years + the year 0 where you pay in your first 10400 you will end up with $1 881 8111, or in other words nearly 2 million.

Edit: And 312k of that is your own money, so you made a 600% profit.

Considering your comment it doesn't seem like you know a lot about investing, and most people here don't know more than joining the first stock that reads ""THE NEXT 50x STOCK"", even after doing that 5 times and making a loss every time. If that's true, take the safe approach and bet on the entire market. What you can do though is diversify into good future ETF, like space and electric energy. 2 more could just be 2 basic ones that existed since forever.

A lot of people see huge gains and aim to become a multi-bulti-millionaire, and while seeing that are not aware that this screenshot is 1 good trade the OP made among tens or even hundreds of barely profitable/negative trades. Or he just did good, but on the good trader come 99 others that do badly.

A lot of people fail to see this. I don't mean this negative. The market doesn't generate money, it loses money. It loses money on fees and conversions of brokers, and the money that is put in is not generated but invested. If 100 people invest $100, then the market goes up by maybe $9980. Maybe less, maybe more, but never the initial investment - and impossible to exceed it. And on each future trade, it will decrease further due to fees. If you see someone making money, it means that others lost money. If you have a safe steady income and not a one time 2k investment, then go for a safe steady play.",oodex,18,/r/pennystocks/comments/m5bg5c/200_a_week_strategies/gqzywu4/,0.08,0.816,0.104,0.4629

241,BIOC," My English is not good, the content is too much, the following is machine translation: Hello everyone, I am from China. Today I will share a stock with you, not investment advice. The stock is called BIOC, a cancer diagnostic company that focuses on the development and sales of proprietary blood sample tests. I like this stock based on the following two considerations, please don't miss it when you pass by. 1. Although this stock has been declining for a long time, it has even fallen into gross votes, its performance has been sluggish for a long time, and it has been at a loss. However, last year, due to the new crown epidemic, it began to attract attention, and during the period, it has exploded several times intermittently. In the two days when the third quarter financial report was announced on November 12, 2020, the stock price rose by 30%. If you carefully study the financial report, you will find that the operating income in the third quarter was 6,586,100 yuan, a year-on-year increase of 330%. This is only one quarter's revenue. You must know that the company's operating revenue in 2019 is only 5.5286 million yuan. The current total operating income for the first three quarters is about 8.95 million yuan. Why did the operating income suddenly increase like this? It turned out that the company started to operate a new business in August 2020, testing COVID-19 samples. For each sample tested, the government subsidized 100 US dollars, so operating income skyrocketed. . The following are the relevant data: 7000 samples were announced on August 3, 2020, 21000 samples were received on August 31, 35000 samples were received on September 16, and 35000 samples were announced on October 29. To 80,000 samples, it was announced on November 12 that it had received 100,000 samples (the financial report was announced at this time, and the revenue in the first three quarters had reached 8.95 million yuan), and it was announced on December 14 that it had received 150,000 samples. It was announced on February 3, 2021 that 250,000 samples had been received. Therefore, the key point is that based on the number of samples tested above, in the next annual report to be published on March 24, 2021, I predict that operating income will increase (150,000-100000) X 100 US dollars = 5 million income. In other words, the total income in 2020 will be at least 8.95 million + 5 million, and there will be at least 14 million in income, which is an increase of 153% relative to the income in 2019! In the two days when the financial report was announced on March 24, I hope to see the stock price also double. The above is based on the view of the financial report, let's talk about this company. 2. Due to the raging new crown epidemic, this testing business is expected to continue for a long time, and Cathie Wood once mentioned that her fund company will focus on cancer testing companies in the next step (you can find this information yourself). Therefore, I am very optimistic about the prospects of this company. Writing these words in a hurry during working hours is not investment advice.

And if it should double any time soon, the stock would get exposure from YouTubers, social media etc. Like any nano and microcap, it's the early days it will 10x, not when they've already reached a high market cap.

But, in this stage, you would have to buy the stock on BELIEF. No doubt about it. Belief and sentiment, not earnings call catalysts.

This does not in anyway aims to go against of what you said. Excellent DD, really liked to read, full of details and all of the necessary information. In the end it left me interested

Nevertheless while I was reading I though of that video that I saw a few time back and it makes me think how these types of brands will actually be able to out-grow whats for me a very niche market.

I know that the main target of companies that sell rugged phones don't watch youtube videos plus its a youtube video... its worth what is worth. But it still makes me wonder!

Phones are getting more and more resistance, and we are getting to a point where you don't even have to go to high flagship phones to see that. And what about the price? Are the prices competitive enough? After all we are talking about a target consumer that most likely will not have an amazing financial situation. I've seen on their website that they have partnerships but I really don't understand at all the US + Canadian phone market and networks. Here in Europe is sooooooo much different xD

This said it should have an upside of 20% on today’s value of $8 and as BTC rises this will only go up (should)

299,RIOT," Yes, but I'm speaking from an investment and valuation standpoint. The stock is moving as a result of uneducated speculation. There are more risks involved with owning equity in a mining company than there are with owning a cryptocurrency. For instance, the price could double, but if the difficulty rating also increases (which it is), the mining company might see no net change in profit, or even a decline, whereas owning the currency would mean a 2x ROI. 

As an example, RIOT is not worth it's $4B market capitalization. Even with the monumental price action in cryptocurrency, RIOT has been unable to generate profit. Mining companies have no unique innovation or moat, and their revenue can be heavily affected by outside forces, such as other mining companies.

I'm not sure what this means. My comment pertains to a realistic market evaluation. You're suggesting a speculative system based on hype and hope. 

> Stocks are worth what people are willing to pay for them regardless of the capital, revenue, management etc of the company.

The sky is above and the ground is below, yes? This is merely pointing out the obvious. Price is what you pay. Value is what you get. I don't think this is the point of debate. 

What you're suggesting is to buy stocks solely on the greater fool theory. What I'm trying to explain is that the value proposition for owning equity in a cryptocurrency company is poor, and the risk is higher. The possibility that a stock may pump as a result of meme power is solely gambling.

It's more reasonable to invest in exchange related companies if your goal is to have exposure to cryptocurrency without holding an actual coin. SOS has never generated a profit. It's stock price has continued to decline, while the price of cryptocurrency has continued to increase.",thirtydelta,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/m5ju58/sos_analysis_breakout_incoming/gr23uqj/,0.095,0.792,0.114,0.6301

For me, I just see it as a good value at this price.  If they get the patent in China and Israel (they’ve got most everywhere else in the world already covered), the patents alone are worth $$$.  And the drug and delivery have shown promise.  

They just really screwed managing the company back in 2018/2019.  Which is why it tanked so hard.  It wasn’t the drug.  But there’s just not a lot of info out there.
