As a graphic designer who has been using Photoshop / Illustrator for years, and you've watched 100's of hours of tutorials, learned ALL the tools you need, and you deliver great work using the software...

14,GDP," Adobe makes some good products and I agree they have more of a moat than Netflix. One comparison on Adobe and Netflix that falls short is on the audience though as Netflix has a substantially larger audience but makes less per user. I wouldn't assume Adobe can reach Netflix user levels as professional tools are only limited to being purchased by that profession.  


Another issue is the price, wouldn't you rather buy something that is cheap than something that is expensive? The tech companies can only see higher valuations if they continue to grow indefinitely and that just doesn't seem like a reasonable assumption considering how much of tech already makes up the stock market's overall valuation or when compared to the GDP.  It just seems like a massive disadvantage to buy them today as you're paying for valuations that assume they'll continue to deliver at an amazing rate for many years to come while reality often throws up roadblocks.",DollarsBackedByAir,1,/r/investing/comments/ov1ml8/adobe_vs_netflix_compared_and_faang_debate/h77b07t/,0.068,0.872,0.06,-0.3248

That being said, these could be possible reasons for many choosing NFLX over ADBE:

1. If you ask a 6-year old what NFLX is, then they would probably be able to tell you. If you ask the same 6-year old what ADBE is, he/she would not have a clue. So, conditioning for the NFLX product starts at a much earlier age. It becomes part of the culture norm.
2. Whatever profession you are in (blue collar to white collar), you are able to use NFLX products with little to no education as NFLX is entertainment. Not so with ADBE. ADBE products require education and are marketed to white collar professions. Meaning...NFLX's TAM is far greater.
3. NFLX generates more revenue (almost double) than ADBE
4. NFLX can pay off a greater percentage of their current, long term debt (with their cash on hand) than ADBE can. NFLX would need 3.8 times their current cash to pay it all off while ADBE would need 6.2 times their current cash....making NFLX safer if the company experiences an economic downturn.

I’d go as far to say Adobe is extremely hostile if you want to do any collaborating whatsoever.

As you mentioned it’s also extremely expensive, especially if you’re a smb. But the greatest risk is losing a generation of new designers due to being priced out.

You use what you’re familiar with and Adobe had the benefit of it’s first few decades as being very easy to pirate. Use pirated software in a school, then when you start working your company will pay what you’re familiar with. If you’re a UI student or self learner, you aren’t going to chose Adobe.

So even if other companies are offering better bonuses, bigger vested stocks, etc. the work life balance is what matters most after a certain age. Also it's amazing to see people (engineers) who stayed in Adobe for 10 years +, while in most companies people stay for maximum 3-4 years.

32,IP," I think with streaming platforms their IP cache/library would be the best indication of their ability to retain users. We've seen how Netflix changed the game when they had a broader access to IPs/contents from other studios/companies back in the day. Now we've also seen how Netflix got fucked raw by the other studios/companies developing their own streaming platforms.

I think Disney is in a great position since their acquisitions, but yeah we'll have to see if any of the studios/companies can constantly pump out great new contents in the future.

With Adobe products you might have to retrain yourself and get used to new products, which might just be the tallest wall to climb over if you want to not depend on Adobe. I'm now just learning how to use GIMP (the open-sourced app, not the other one lol) and it's still taking quite some time to get used to. Photoshop was just easier to use cos it's what I've been taught and used for a loooong time.

Though from a user perspective, I think the shift from having the option to buy a one-time purchase license to periodic subscription is pretty shit (I know you still can do it, but it's definitely harder to do now). From a financial perspective, I think Adobe knows what's up lol. It'll take a massive amount of capital and integrated education promotion to get people to use alternative software (think Chrome OS with students & schools today vs Microsoft Windows as default elsewhere).",arafdi,6,/r/investing/comments/ov1ml8/adobe_vs_netflix_compared_and_faang_debate/h76naxc/,0.029,0.852,0.12,0.9731
33,IT," >And paying $240 in the scheme of things for a full time professional is still minimal.

That's what people don't understand about businesses - and adobe is a business product. 

The company is paying $80k for the designer (depending on the country), thousands of dollars for the workstation, and thousands more for other ancillary expenses to support the business. 

The deductible $240 doesn't matter ... that might be one hour of billable design work per year. 

A similar (although not identical) scale applies for freelancers as well; a slight improvement in functionality *or* efficiency makes the cost worthwhile. 

As an individual, if I have issues with my home computer, I might spend hours troubleshooting it. At work, if I have a problem with my laptop, I'll call IT and they'll immediately give me a new laptop and then try to figure out the problem with my old one; it's a loss for me to spend time futzing around when I should be doing other work.

If the ""cycle"" he references is ""extreme market inefficiency causing a bubble followed by a crash"", he's *still* ignoring the truly massive effect of QE.

53,IMO," Having access to cheap capital helps immensely. You can just leverage up and wait it out since you’re not bleeding money on interest. 

Traditional hedges are done in the market, real estate, gold you’re right. But gold in my opinion isn’t a great one just from a liquidity ect standpoint. Real estate only works IMO if you can have the capital, and deal with the asset/cash just sitting for a bit. Which only rich can afford. 

Market hedges are the most interesting/accessible IMO. Properly hedging is rough, and expensive generally. Commodity producing companies are my favorite, inflation hits, we devalue dollar, and they’re loving it. Forex is not a bad option either. If you’re looking for a hedge, I’d suggest getting margin on a brokerage account, and leaving it alone until shit hits the fan. Then start buying on the bounce back up and wait. 

Hedges should bleed money for as long as possible though, and only save you when it really hits bad. Just like insurance. Hope that offered a bit more insight.",DJfubz,20,/r/investing/comments/ovdc9m/what_do_the_ultra_rich_do_beforehand_to_prepare/h78hczp/,0.036,0.743,0.221,0.9907

They also can have money sitting in businesses and realestate that may be making a profit, but if not, is good for tax management. . As others mentioned, much of the purpose of hedge funds is to guard against major drops (capital preservation) not to make money.

56,ALL," I don't think he's suggesting that they're timing the market.  They have capital in low/no-yield assets that they then convert to high-yield assets when everything goes on sale.

It's like me having a rainy-day fund in cash, crash hits, i don't have any reason to believe that I'll be laid off or need the rainy-day fund in the immediate future, so I take some money out of that and buy equity on sale.

It would be dumb of me to have ALL of my money in the stock-market because I don't have anything to fall back on in the event of an emergency and if that emergency is in the middle of the stock market crashing, then I'd have to pull out money that has lost significant value rather than essentially retaining the value it had pre-crash.

87,BP," You probably know already from the other comments that your portfolio is extremely one-sided and risky. There are 2 main approaches to diversification: 1) diversification is the only free lunch in investing and 2) diversification is not needed if you are really familiar with the few focused investments you make.

I personally have been moving from the 1st to the 2nd approach lately. I have over 20 years of experience as an investor and I think I have improved during that time. You are just starting up, but if you are really good at retail, tech product development and long R&D projects and internet marketing and some other areas then I kind of see what you are going for. I cannot really tell you how well your portfolio will fare in the future and I cannot know your financial situation and how badly you would react to market downturns. I can tell you that there is huge correlation between your stock picks (with the exception of a few of the smaller choices) and they will generally almost all move at the same time to the same direction.

A few suggestions for you:

* take 10% of your portfolio and allocate that in some way to your best ideas in consumer discretionary/brands (you have a few stocks in that area)
* Decide how to allocate next 10% between your best choices for e-retail
* Put 30% to that global index
* Put 10% to your best idea in the energy sector (I guess it is BP in this case)
* Put 10% into your best ideas in healthcare
* You seem to be interested in the automotive sector, allocate 10% into your best ideas there
* Allocate 20% into your mixed ideas that do not fit above and to some new investments that you want to start a small position for to follow them better.

This is not a perfect allocation, but it is somehow structured and it kind of forces you to think which companies you see as the most promising investments in each of these sectors and it has a bit less internal correlation (it is far from perfect on that front). It also creates a framework that you could use in the beginning to rebalance towards with new money (do not sell anything to rebalance towards this once it is setup, use new money for rebalancing).

OP asked if he is well diversified, he isn't. All of his assets are highly correlated because they are all paper assets (and even the same subclass, tech stocks).

Different asset classes have different risks and rewards, you need to know what you are doing. I'm still amazed how everyone accepts that it takes years of learning and experience to be a good doctor or lawyer or engineer, however when it comes to investing people expect to be a good investor after a year. To just buy stuff on a hot tipp from someone they know, discussed while drinking a beer or two during a BBQ...Or they hide behind the word ""retail"" as if it's an excuse to be average, no time or wish to put in the effort to learn investing (in different asset classes).

96,USA," Kind of an odd one here but I wanted a few opinions about my strategy. Had a windfall of about $750K from my fathers life insurance policy which I'm planning on putting aside for my retirement. My timeline would be for the money to be invested for the next 20 to 30 years. Hoping to retire in my late 50s or early 60s.

I was thinking of investing it in a blend of mutual funds, 35% Total Market 30% SP-500 Index, 20% International, 5% Emerging Markets, 10% Total or investment grade bonds. 

\- 31 years old, USA, married, 2 kids

\- Employed making \~$100k, 2 incomes, increasing over the next three years

\- Only large debt is my home with a loan of about $215K but interest rate is 2.875%

\- Other investments are about $300K between my wife and I of both retirement and taxable accounts largely in a variety of funds 95% stock, 5% bonds.

Any other thoughts on how this could be invested aggressively or if there are any core components I should add? Should it be simplified further to just Total market and total bonds?

97,UK," I'm considering using Interactive Broker UK with leverage and wondering if their margin rates are for the original loan amount or based on the current value.

1. I buy a stocks with £50 and they loan the other £50 for a total position of £100. If **maintenance margin** is 20%, would I get a margin call if the value of the stock goes down to £80 (20% of £100)?
2. What happens if the stock price goes up from the original £100 to £200.. can I still safely hold until it goes down to £80 or would I now get a margin call at £160 (20% of £200)?

If you can explain like I'm 5 that would be great. Thank you.

101,MSCI," They take a base index, like the MSCI US Index for example. Then 
 they start constructing the MSCI US Minimum Volatility Index by screening for the stocks with the lowest volatility in that index. But when they do that, it might cause other factors besides volatility to become different than the MSCI US Index. For example, maybe many of the lowest volatility stocks are also so-called 'value' stocks with low P/E. If they don't correct for that, the resulting index would be a low vol + value index. They only want to focus on the low vol aspect, so instead, they're going to correct for that by adding more of the low volatility stocks that are more 'growth' style with higher P/E. That way the only factor that is significantly different from the parent index is the low vol factor.  

Barra Equity Model is a model that measures eleven or so different style factors plus sector weights and those are the ones they are correcting for. Co-variance means that when they adjust the weights, they take into account the ways in which different factors often group together.",kiwimancy,1,/r/investing/comments/ov3vj4/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h78mkrk/,0.093,0.875,0.032,-0.9032
