200 x 14.53 = $2,906

2,DD, Thanks for sharing. Just for clarification does DD mean due diligence?,coastal_neon,32,/r/stocks/comments/o1jm8m/a_note_to_young_investors_or_new_investors/h2189nd/,0.0,0.612,0.388,0.6908
3,DD," Great story, and the key in all this, is:

> Do your DD and hold onto what you're confident in.

The reason you were able to buy Consol at $9 and sell at $55, and Nvidia at $24, and hold until now, was because you picked stocks that were reasonably priced & had great up side potential. Now, with Consol, you probably just got lucky since the stock has since crashed from its high. But even still, you did not buy at $90 and then sit on your butt hoping for the day it goes to $180. That would've been a futile dream and you'd be down over 80% on your money today.

Many people on Reddit don't realize this. Or they do realize it but cannot get over the other advice - which you yourself gave - that ""time in the market is better than timing the market."" The problem being, while that is *generally* the case, it is *not* the case if you buy at market highs on fundamentally bad stocks, funds, or sectors. As your own story illustrated, Consol never returned to $90. Or even the $55 you sold it at. This isn't necessarily because it was a bad company when you bought it, but is rather because the sector it's in - coal - has since crashed over environmental concerns.
 
So without due diligence, and without paying attention to the market, I'd argue that the market isn't nearly as forgiving as the old saying goes. You could well buy high into a stock that *never* recovers or goes bankrupt, taking your money with it.

Consequently, I think to your advice, I'd add the following - ""time in the index is better than timing the index"" and ""only buy individual stocks if you are willing to not only do due diligence, but manage your positions over the long-term."" Because company and industry fortunes can change, as shown by the collapse of, for example, video renting retail stores and the coal industry. With actual stocks, you *can't* just assume ""it'll come back.""

If you're a buy and forget type of person, buy the index and hold it until you need it. There's better and worse times to enter the market, to be sure, so always keep cash on hand, but you're better off investing now than grow old waiting for the market to crash.",EtadanikM,59,/r/stocks/comments/o1jm8m/a_note_to_young_investors_or_new_investors/h21d3tb/,0.096,0.813,0.092,-0.6965

11,CAN," Nice post but i would like to add (you already kinda said it with „nothing you cant afford“..) that this kinda tactic only works if you are rich or if you actually CAN leave your money there, essentially „forget“ your money there without worrying each second what will happen. 

If you are poor, these 1000bucks are ridiculously important.

Next year i have to pay back 10k € (student loan). I have around 6k atm. Iam trying to invest smartly, i unfortunately dont work anymore, and iam trying to reach 10k so i can get out of Uni without a debt. But also, i will have 0 bucks in my bank account.

Wtf should i do ? I see ppl gaining with options, ofcourse losing ones aswell. 

Iam currently thinking to take all 6 and invest in a good options call, 1-2-3% would equal around 20-30%. But this Fed thing yesterday and the general concern (inflation) makes me really worried.

And cause all of this is not enough, my father told me that they are not working 40h weeks anymore but 35. which has a huge effect on us. I kinda have the pressure to do something. Ohh man..... iam tired honestly. And then i see ppl yoloing 2million.

13,GME," The market is not a get rich quick scheme.  If you treat it as such, you’ll be treated like a casino patron.  

My father’s timeless advice: the longer you stay in a casino, the more likely you are to lose.  The longer you stay in the stock market, the more likely you are you win.

Forget the stock picking.  Half of all mutual funds fail to beat the S&P 500.  To repeat, most people that have this as a day job can’t beat a boring index.

Think in decades, give up on DFV level expectations of returns, and you are guaranteed to retire rich.  Or... you can put it all on Red (AMC, GME, Bitcoin, whatever) and prepare to get comped a room, a buffet, and a realization of your inner most self.

Variety of products now on their website including PC parts, plushies, collectibles, arcade machines and more and one day delivery on items.
They have a YT channel going.
They have a partnership with Xbox.
NFT token in development and they have like 1b in bank to transform the company after they already paid off all of their debt.

I think if RC does what he did with Chewy, he could easily make Gamestop a big company again and while I know its extremely controversial, I generally see it as a good long term play. It seems like a stock that if it keeps getting good news in its transformation, I'll be able to hold it for ten years.

103,AMD," intel has changed leadership and is focusing on new architecture for their cpus which can be a game changer. 

AMD is making a lot of positive moves but AMD is also fractured with a lot of fingers in many different cookie jars. Their platform is schismed between all of their different endeavors - CPU & GPU. That's great to get money but that means the majority of their time is beholden to partner R&D. Chips for tesla, chips for sony, chips for microsoft, but nothing to push themselves to #1.

- Buy some McDonalds chicken nuggets
- Donate the leftovers to a homeless guy, be their lottery
- Buy some hexagonal Ray Ban sunglasses, like Travis from Taxi Driver wore
- Buy Scarface 3 for me lol, I’ve yet to watch and don’t want to pay
- Save it in a safe
- Burn the cash
- Eat it
- Donate to the r/stocks mods
- Buy a bunch of Reddit stickers or whatever they’re called
- Fundrise, other crowdfunding platforms, and REITs, to diversify into real esate on a smaller scale than Graham Stephan lol
- Tape it to the wall and call it art
- Best, but not least, donate to Wikipedia, and keep the information age rolling

Invest in silver! 

Silver is not just a shiny rock. 70% of all silver is used for industrial purposes - the electronic device that you reading this on uses silver - YOU HAVE SILVER IN YOUR HAND RIGHT NOW, whether it's a phone, mouse, keyboard, you are currently holding silver. And there is a shortage of it. 

Gold and silver are known as inflation hedges, however, they have these huge spikes that are tremendous buying opportunities.

Famous investor, Warren Buffett bought 130 million ounces of silver in 1997!

There is only about a billion ounces of silver mined every year, so it’s an incredibly small physical market.  It's easy to see how a small change of 130 million ounces could affect the price.

Some online dealers have said that they have done a whole years of business in only 3 months.

Online sellers are running out of stock, (have a look yourself) they are hiring more people, working 7 days a week, and it is still taking 2-6 weeks for orders to arrive.  There are a few websites that say 20 day shipping delay, etc. 

There are reports of mints running out of silver. (Poland, Mexico, and the Perth Mint) and then to pour some more gasoline on this fire, 2 silver miners have decided to not sell their silver right now because they know they can sell it for more money in a few months. (Endeavor, First Majestic)

Silver is actually an incredibly small market, and the prices are set on the margins (an increase or decrease in retail demand) There is less than a billion ounces mined every year, and with 70% of that going businesses like Tesla and Apple, only around 300 million ounces worldwide are available for investment.

Solar panel production uses a HUGE amount of silver and it is going up.  China just went “all in” on solar panels - and most people know about the United States' ""New Green"" aspirations. Solar panels though, omg. As if the increase in electronic devices, EV's, and personal investment wasn't enough to drive the demand of silver up.

Right now, China is undoubtedly realizing that silver is a critical and strategic metal. China is more involved and protective of their corporations than America, and their military will need silver for all their electronics. IE, if they run out, this affects their national security. It's also a strategic metal for American military manufactures. China, Tesla, or any other corporation could easily buy up the worlds annual supply.

Silver is so limited that there's only about a half an ounce of silver per person on the planet.

We can’t just turn on new silver mining like a light switch! It takes about 5 years to bring a mine from the silver explorer to the silver producer - supply will not be able to rise to meet demand.

The price of silver is currently artificially suppressed due to the paper silver market. 

Our economy is walking on thin ice. The government's ONLY tool is to print more money, which is what caused the problems in the first place.

Silver and gold are the best hedges for inflation. Silver wins in any scenario though, even a perfect economy.",legitchurro,-5,/r/stocks/comments/o1i21v/how_much_of_my_money_should_be_invested/h212kna/,0.032,0.887,0.081,0.9816

Price likely to exceed $30, considering SOFI is so undervalued compared to other fintechs..
just one example: larger earnings and growth forecast than Robinhood, which is set to go public with a $40B valuation this summer (which will likely grow $60B off a first day of trading 50% jump).
Even at $40.. SOFI would have a market cap below $35B.

250,AE," Just exited a sizable position fully in Fast Retailing (FRCOY) which I've held since May of last year.

Going to put that money to work in American Eagle (AEO) for a couple reasons.

&#x200B;

1. Fast/Uniqlo offerings more winter focused (thermals, sweats, activewear, tech) while American Eagle/Aerie more summer focused (lounge, swim, underwear) and we are set to have the hottest summer on record
2. Uniqlo's business is primarily Asia focused. We are seeing hiccups in vaccination/reopening efforts currently in Asia, foot traffic has actually declined, while America is reopened fully and consumer spending is way up, and foot traffic is WAY up. Uniqlo heavily depends on foot traffic for sales, while AE has really beefed up its online business, especially in Aerie. It now makes up 40% of sales, increasing over 150% yoy.
3. I see momentum in Aerie's underwear business, and give them a **really plausible shot to overtake Victoria's Secret for number one in market share in seven years,** assuming a 50% growth rate and constant decay thereafter. Uniqlo has a very weak underwear business
4. I see momentum in AEO's jeans business, and **we are entering the first jeans ""supercycle"" in 20 years, as skinnies are going out in a big way, and relaxed/flare/boyfriend/mom/wide leg styles come back for the first time since the 70s.** Remember since the last time more relaxed styles came back, they dominated for around 25 years, as jeans focused brands Gap/A&F/Aeropostale/Express etc. had their first heyday. AEO has a good selection of more popular styles today, while I see Uniqlo is still focused on skinnies, even as skinnies = new mom jeans. I see a jeans retail boom coming and lasting for the next decade as styles rapidly change.

273,AMD," I am swing trading Nvidia, while its a risk i already did capture insane profits on it on selling. Problem it is that it also rose with the stock split announcement which would make it irrational rise, it also participates in all tech rises and is currently way above valuation than their tech peers.

Problem with AMD is that its all time high is 	99,23, sure it might reverse from insane increase today, but it also might slowly go even higher and start scratching its ceiling, if it does that i would be stuck with dick in my hands.

What i wanted to say is i would gladly swing all big tech i have, but i don't have a case on any but Nvidia. For example any other tech could start releasing news in tech bullish times and that can send a stock to the moon, missing out on these news would be the biggest risk, that is why long term holds in big tech are long term holds mostly for me, unless something gets seriously out of line like Nvidia.

Of course if the stocks yeet up and stay there, there is no satisfying buying back into them.

382,AMC," You aren’t doing anything “wrong”, per sé, except maybe one thing: your mindset appears to be focused far too much on the short-term.

Real money in investing is made over the course of years, or even decades. Judging your own performance based on short-term price movements over the span of mere months is a fool’s errand. Anything can happen to markets in the short-term; they can go up, down, sideways, or in fucking circles, but in the long-term, they can only really go up.

Continue to do your due diligence and invest in stocks and funds that you have researched and understand. Do not get discouraged by short-term underperformance, and do not chase outperformance by throwing your savings at failing companies like GameStop and AMC. If you have the patience, your discipline and sound decision-making will be rewarded eventually.

388,DOW," It seems you're moving late on things or moving incorrectly. The market moves quickly. You said you were getting killed in tech. Why move out? You have to identify stocks that you believe in or have an investment thesis. In downturns on those companies, if nothing fundamental has changed with the core business and it's just market noise, then that's a strict discount, you should be buying more not clearing out. I think the market noise is guiding your moves versus finding companies you understand. Play a few good companies and you will come to understand what is on discount vs what isn't. If you are chasing market news you will continue to get pushed around. If you are holding etf's just consistently buy as it doesn't matter long term what's happening now. You either buy into a rising economy or you get discounts. 

As for the economic analysis, you'll come to refine your understanding. Everyone thinks inflation = bad, not necessarily. Runaway inflation is, and the feds indicated that they will control inflation so that it doesn't get out of hand. With rates still near zero, and future rate hikes pushed out to what looks like 2023, that is still 2 yrs of growth runway for growth/tech etc. Because reopening / inflation fear plays had a good runup, the street likes to find alpha elsewhere, and given the new fed direction, the alpha is in the beaten up tech sector which has seen some recovery. DOW and S&P stocks can only be so richly valued, tech can be richly valued too but there is a larger case for their valuations. In short, for the near term, the daq is back. In order to ride out these sector rotations and stuff however, you really need to find good solid companies you enjoy, so you dont lose sleep. Meaning if the price drops, that's a discount buy, if it rises, great. You should be winning either way with your picks regardless of the immediate dollar P/L reflected in your portfolio.

390,NET," I find it helpful to know what percentage each investment makes up of your portfolio, and whether you’re comfortable with that percentage. For instance, if you had 5 stocks with the same amount invested in each, you’d have 20% in each stock. Then let’s say one of those stocks shoots up 300%. Now it makes up 28% of your portfolio. You could either sell off that 8% to bring it in line with your other investments, or decide that you want to stay at that higher percentage. 

If NET is your only stock, or makes up a large percent of your portfolio, you need to decide whether you’re comfortable with that risk. Diversification reduces risk. So i’d suggest trimming back to a percentage you’re more comfortable with and try to maintain that percentage. If the stock goes up, trim.

414,PHD, Fed announcement yesterday that rates will rise twice in 2023 usd strengthened  all commodities are in usd meaning they went down. Don’t panic it’s not that inflation isn’t a real issue because it is. If people start to see it increase pace more people like you will buy gold / silver that demand should push it up. Also as more stimulus is announced usd should soften meaning commodities will go up. I am using this as an opportunity to add to my position personally. Once usd stops appreciating or levels off might be a good opportunity to add as the trend in usd is down. Follow DXY it’s the USD index. Don’t panic sell at a loss I would add personally. I don’t think the commodity boom is over just fed policy has created expectations that usd securities in the future will provide higher returns driving dollar demand.

415,PM," I bought Silver at 36$/oz back in 2009 before it tanked, so don’t feel too bad.

Precious metals correlate more to macro volatility than to inflation expectations. You’d only see silver and gold take off if there was doubt Central Banks could get things under control, like a hyperinflation scenario or a deflationary event.

If you really wanted to hedge against inflation, you should just short TLT, there’s so much going on in PM markets it’s exhausting.

416,JP," So first of all, JP Morgan collects the shit out of those ETF's in fees. Even if we had inflation jump to 5% you'd get fucked because of it. Also, and this is *super* important, but JP Morgan owns all the silver and gold. And in the contract, they *always* have the option to buy out 'fair market' value for the metals. Practically, this is like what happened in the US with gold. The US locked in the exchange rate which disconnected it from the market.

A way to envision this is imagine a time where we get a massive inflation spike. Lets say after the spike it says $1000 for an ounce of silver. But no one will sell you an ounce for $100 even though that is the 'market' price. The true price is infinity because existing dollars are now considered worthless. The market has disconnected. What JP Morgan can now do is pay off every SLV holder $1000 for each share of SLV they own, which is meaningless when the $1000 buys them nothing.

Of course that's an extreme example and the odds of the US currency collapsing like that is basically impossible. But a less extreme version of this can happen where holders of SLV still get fucked, just a little less fucked.",orderfour,1,/r/stocks/comments/o1w396/my_inflation_hedge_broke/h24hk32/,0.117,0.759,0.123,-0.3579

446,CHPT," Since no one is giving you exact examples but rather just broad generalizations. Here is a good idea. You want to invest 100? Well you clearly can’t afford an Amazon stock lol. And don’t do “fractions of shares” shit. Eff that. So now you know you’re limited to stock prices less than or equal to 100. 

Then just go based on companies that are solid or have good growth potential (if you have the timeframe). For example. GE V. O  is a solid stock. 8 bucks a share now. Will easily grow to 20 bucks by end of year. Almost a 300% return. I highly doubt that X this year will go from 24 to 100. You won’t see that most likely.

447,GE," Since no one is giving you exact examples but rather just broad generalizations. Here is a good idea. You want to invest 100? Well you clearly can’t afford an Amazon stock lol. And don’t do “fractions of shares” shit. Eff that. So now you know you’re limited to stock prices less than or equal to 100. 

Then just go based on companies that are solid or have good growth potential (if you have the timeframe). For example. GE V. O  is a solid stock. 8 bucks a share now. Will easily grow to 20 bucks by end of year. Almost a 300% return. I highly doubt that X this year will go from 24 to 100. You won’t see that most likely.

500,NL," Depends what you are comfortable with. A friend of mine is going to be in the same situation, he has no experience with investing so I told him to buy some books and start with etf's, maybe dividend stocks.

I'm gonna sell my appartment in NL to live in a poor country, cause said friend has his girlfriend there, and can live from what he is getting. I'm going to buy stocks with it, cause that's what I do with my current savings.

You could take more risk with 10k than with a million.",SuperSalmone,0,/r/stocks/comments/o1w6h4/you_come_into_a_relatively_large_sum_of_money/h230yja/,0.055,0.828,0.117,0.8614
