23,RE," That's of course true. That's why I say they lost less. But:   
REITs are not people, they can disregard inflation caused by real estate price spike  
REIT can also outwait market dip, which some houseowners can't   
REIT can absorb higher reconstruction and maintenance cost brought by higher RE prices (as they usually purchase at bulk prices)  


A houseowner is now frequently tied into his place, because he can't sell the house and buy a similar quality house elsewhere without significant investment to refitting etc.

And since they were soooo wrong in 2021, we have no idea whether their rate hikes, which screwed regional banks, will be on the right side of that.

Anyway, these shares sit in a Roth account. I've a feeling MU will pop after earnings tomorrow. Maybe it will trade between $65-$70. My idea was if we do get a pop, I was going to sell covered calls at the $70 strike price and if my shares get called away - I would then buy back in when MU does its inevitable fall back to lows $60s. For instance, If I can buy back in at $62, I could reduce my cost basis from $86 a share to $78 a share ($70-$62 = $8 per share reduced cost basis).

89,ATVI," I think the deal is going to go through, but I also think that if it doesn't the immediate impact is going to be much greater than the impact after some time (let's say 3-6 months). The reason for this is that for anyone who bought ATVI after the merger announcement, as well as people who have held throughout, the investment thesis boils down to the probability that it will go through (so, let's say a 24% gain discounted for risk). If the risk that this gain doesn't occur becomes 100 % there is going to be an overreaction, because few if any investors are in it now for any other reason than the merger.",draw2discard2,1,/r/stocks/comments/12399a3/activision_proving_doubters_wrong/jdw536c/,0.038,0.831,0.131,0.9136
90,EA," I'm in that camp to the extent that I had bought some not very long before the acquisition announcement and have bought more after. I do think that it would gradually recover from the overreaction, but I don't think it is in any way guaranteed that its price point would be pre-announcement since others in the industry (e.g. EA are down since that time).",draw2discard2,1,/r/stocks/comments/12399a3/activision_proving_doubters_wrong/jdwleml/,0.022,0.978,0.0,-0.09

92,DO," With all the fuckery we are working through I don’t know for sure.   Your assumptions are correct me thinks.   Here are some trust me bro numbers.  

In July 2021 took all bond (All) money out of 401k.  Fact saved money.  

Put 555 back into a 401k bond fund Feb 6th.  Started losing money not much but some as the interest rate rose.  Down to 545.

Once these banks started failing and the interest declined as of Friday settled at 565.

So here’s the deal.  The market says bond prices will be about 3.9 or something and the Fed says FU the prices will be 5.2 or something.  

Somebody has to blink.  If the market is correct yes buy your bonds now.  If JPOW is correct DO NOT buy your bonds now and sell your stocks too.  

Ain’t this fun.  Currently 50 bonds 30 stocks 20 cash in the investment decision account.",Whythehellnot_wecan,3,/r/stocks/comments/1235c9h/bond_outlook_for_the_next_few_years/jdtg5dv/,0.079,0.792,0.129,0.7693
93,AAPL," Here's how I see... There's a very high chance bonds will appreciate in price over the next few years as inflation drops and the US potentially enters recession. That is unless you believe ageing demographics and technology is suddenly inflationary or something because there's really no good reason to believe inflationary pressures will be structurally higher this decade than it was over the last. This is just my opinion though, there are people who disagree and think bonds yields will continue to rise, I just think their arguments are poor.

But that said, I think there are still risks. Again, this is just my opinion, but in my opinion bonds are not as safe as people believe they are. If you buy treasuries you're basically guaranteed to get the nominal value of your investment back, but this is very different from a real return of capital. I think people need to think about the risk of treasuries from a debt/GDP perspective in that should the US ever be in a position where it can't reasonably service its debts, then inflation would be used as a policy tool to repay bondholders without default as it was post-WWII when debt levels hit similar levels to today.

Realistically with US debt/GDP at something like 130% we're in a situation where the US simply can't afford to continue to run the kind of budget deficits it has been over the last couple of decades. But the solutions aren't straight forward, because cutting spending or raising taxes will slow growth which makes it even harder to solve the debt/GDP issue. And ageing demographics will only exacerbate the problem as more of the population retires increasing the burden of social security spending, while the taxable workforce stalls out.

But with a stock like AAPL if the US ever does decide to use inflation as a weapon to fight national debt then great companies will simply pass that inflation down to their consumers and they should act as an inflation hedge as their nominal earnings increase. However bond holders in real terms will effectively be ""wiped out"" in such a situation, or at the very least you will not see a positive real return on your investment.

This is an edge case scenario near-term, but one which will happen eventually as Munger has pointed out himself, https://www.youtube.com/shorts/oLTlZ0Xd3e8

So yeah, 90% chance it's a good time to buy bonds, unless you're worried that there will be another pandemic or war and the US will be forced to let inflation rip to fund a large deficit. Right now at 130% debt/GDP the US can just about manage it, but another shock to the system and I personally wouldn't want to be owning government bonds.",kriptonicx,1,/r/stocks/comments/1235c9h/bond_outlook_for_the_next_few_years/jdv3524/,0.131,0.766,0.103,-0.9016
94,LSI," There's about a 2/3 chance that lump sum beats DCA. And if you are for example saving money each month for years, you shouldn't likely be DCA but just put them in right when you get them.

You can [try it out here](https://www.chooseinvesting.com/calc/historical-index-returns/) if DCA or LSI would have been the best option in any year for about 100 years.

If you receive a huge windfall I get it if you want to DCA since its scary with that amount but if your saving it up yourself you should probably be just putting it in as soon as you get them.",EmmaTheFemma94,1,/r/stocks/comments/122zky6/dollar_cost_average/jdt20sz/,0.039,0.853,0.107,0.7506

98,HR," You will not get double taxed no.  I’m sure your employer will give you the proper tax documents at the end of the year.  It will
show what was taken out in taxes and then the tax program will calculate the accurate tax amount, like you said it could be long term gain, and would adjust so you probably get some of that $3k back next year.

If overly concerned I would just contact HR and ask.
