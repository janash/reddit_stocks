One thing to keep in mind is that you need to have a long enough timeline. During a market crash, it could take several years to recover.  I would think 30 years is a long enough time frame.  

Also, no one says you can't take profits off the table.  Once this fund hits a $1,000,000 or more, it's going to be spitting off tens of thousands of dollars per day.  You can easily cash that out, live on it, invest in RE or other lower risk entities.  Lots of options here.

There are a few risks. If US economy can steadily grow in the next 20-30 years, this strategy will reward you very well. If japan like contraction happens, well, not good for any investors, and this portfolio will be affected more. 

There is also a liquidity risk associated with these LETFs. You know, even though the value cannot be wipe out in a single day, in a steady bear market there will be lots of money outflow. And at some point the management company might call “that’s it” and liquidate the entire fund.

7,RSI," I just pushed my algo live a couple weeks ago, so we'll see what the performance is like.   
I am using UPRO, although TQQQ would produce even better results.  Strategy is simple, compound as much as possible, but the implementation is a little more complicated.

1) Buying opportunities.  This is optional, but I use RSI - triple exponential hourly and look for opportunities to buy.  

2) Covered call opportunities.  The intent of this is to scrape a little off the top and buy back more shares with the premium.  I use the RSI again, but look for overbought opportunities.  Then I sell a call with a low probability of hitting (eg. delta < 10%).  I then use any premium to buy back in 1).

3) Add protection against a massive downswing.  I use a combination short EMA - long SMA crossing + negative momentum percentage indicator to basically decide to 'get the hell out'.  This is essentially a kill switch set to liquidate everything.  

4) Wait out any potential recession.  This is just a simple short EMA - mid SMA cross to the upside.  

The backtesting will obviously not yield real results, but they were very encouraging.  There were a few shorter periods where it under performed UPRO, but still outperformed SPY.  But over longer periods of time you saw significant compounding. Eg. 2016-2021 saw 1800% vs UPRO 530% vs SPY 120%.

Where this will likely underperform SPY is when you see 1) a really long downward environment (eg. Japan).  But it should still outperform just holding UPRO due to selling of the calls.  2) If there were major false positives of the downside protection.  Eg. Liquidating and then buying back in at a higher price.  There would need to be several significant movements to the downside followed by a quick recovery - spaced months apart for this to happen.",funktacular,5,/r/investing/comments/ol6tza/does_tqqq_break_leverage_etfs_are_not_long_term/h5d4rqo/,0.089,0.801,0.11,0.4649

10,DTE," Just some food for thought:

* Unclear what you mean by DCA. You DCA back in after you liquidated? Over how many periods? There's been many studies that show DCA actually underperforms lump sum. Here's the YTD performance of 50/50 UPRO/TMF lump sum start of the year vs legging in every Friday: [https://imgur.com/gallery/PAYNURL](https://imgur.com/gallery/PAYNURL). So DCA for sure missed the big TMF drawdown at the beginning of the year. But, if you can stomach the swings (which you need to with a leveraged strategy), it's better to lump sum.
* There are also many studies that show time in market > timing the market, and big rebound days occur shortly after big drop days. If you miss those big rebound days, you miss out on a lot of return. EMA/SMA upside crossover is most likely too slow. I would consider not 100% liquidation. My own backtesting shows going to cash only 40-50% outperforms 100% cash.
* 2020 w/ the V shaped recovery is an outlier. I wouldn't consider any backtest that includes 2020 as indicative of anything. If a 2020-like crash/rebound happens again, great, it was a huge buying opportunity, but I would discount 2020 as it completely skews the results.
* What DTE is your covered call? How much of your position do you sell? I also sell +1 month 20 delta calls, but limit to 30% of my position. Again, time in market > timing the market.

15,DTE," Great points, and aligns well with what I observed.  

The DCA I refer to is just available new funds, dripping in over time.  The 'buy' signals assume time in market > timing the market, so it actually targets maxing equity so that it can take advantage of the calls.  That is, at any buy signal it will try to utilize all the cash in the account - a small buffer for fees (data subscriptions etc).

The EMA/SMA cross over is really only used in the case of a major drawdown, so the hope is that it shouldn't happen often.  My killswitch only triggered 6-7 times from 2014.  Definitely an area for optimization though, so I'll play around with the 40-50% cash (or even a leveled approach).

Totally get the point of discounting 3/2020 -> now.  It does offer some great insight into the advantage of limiting the drawdown, and the power of the compounding though.

The DTE is approx 2-3 weeks.  My entire portfolio is covered to try to max the premiums.  My current call strategy is a little odd, but we'll see how it goes.  I'm using the delta and a minimum % coverage to identify the strike, but also putting in a 5 day fill limit order at least $0.20. Right now this seems to limit the number of times that the contract is actually exercised, which is the ideal.  From my backtests rolling out the options to the same or higher strike underperformed just letting it exercise and buying back in with my signals.  It also complicated things which brings more edge cases and potential for issues. In the end I felt it was a much better decision to optimize around selling a contract that doesn't execute, over trying to manage an existing contract that was going to execute.",funktacular,1,/r/investing/comments/ol6tza/does_tqqq_break_leverage_etfs_are_not_long_term/h5ff991/,0.016,0.881,0.102,0.9733

Even if you invested $1,000,000 in QLD riiiight before the dot-com bubble burst, you'd still be outperforming QQQ today. By about 200%. Yes, you would have lost a lot of your initial investment and lagged behind for quite a while. And if it weren't for the COVID rally, you wouldn't be outright ahead just yet. But these are all things that absolutely did happen and cannot be discounted.

QLD ≠ TQQQ, in order to crash QLD like TQQQ we would need a massively improbable bubble of unheard proportions. We can argue all you want if we will ever see a bubble of this size, but in all honesty, we can't know.

In any case, OP is talking about TQQQ and you said:

>I can only imagine that 3x would be even greater.

To which I'm replying that no, it's not greater, it's actually terrible. TQQQ would have been wiped out in the dot-com bubble, in the real world a fund losing 99.99% is dead.

But even playing pretend and assuming that TQQQ wouldn't have closed down, it would still be at like 60% of its January 2000 value (not its pre-crash ATH, because obviously it would be dishonest to take that specific value). We are in 2021. More than 20 years and you still wouldn't be even. Doesn't sound like a great long term investment to me.

Your DCAing argument **only** works because the crash is at the beginning of your calculation period. But that's a fluke.

Assuming that you invest in TQQQ for 20 years (from 25yo to 45yo let's say), can you confidently say that no crash will happen in the second half of your investment period? If so you're a market wizard, and TQQQ is indeed a fantastic long term investment. If not, then you are running the not-so-unlikely risk of wiping out 10+ years of DCAed investments.

>But even playing pretend and assuming that TQQQ wouldn't have closed down, it would still be at like 60% of its January 2000 value (not its pre-crash ATH, because obviously it would be dishonest to take that specific value)

Unfortunately, we're just not going to see eye-to-eye on this. I admit that TQQQ is too much (and not ideal) leverage to simply buy and hold and never rebalance your portfolio or not keep an eye on while just passively DCA'ing into it.

It's not comparable to the dot com for TQQQ. It's honestly ridiculous to even suggest such a thing.

TQQQ would have fallen to 0.07% of its ATH during the dot com. It would have fallen to 7% of its pre-GFC ATH in 2008.

Meaning that you would have had 100x more money after a GFC-level crisis compared to after a dot com-level crisis.

So yes, the GFC is definitely overshadowed by the dot com bubble (as far as TQQQ is concerned) because of how LETFs work.

>Did you even effort this? Or did you just make an assumption? 

You can easily check for yourself. TQQQ would now be at 60ish% of its value in January 2000 had it existed.

Lol.

>and you held the line and kept DCA'ing

How many time do I have to tell you that this comment is completely braindead? The fact that you make money **later** doesn't erase the fact that you lost money **before**... A 99% loss is a 99% loss, it doesn't matter how many times you repeat that you'll make it back later by DCAing, you still lost 99% of your investment.

>you're sitting on 5600% ROI today. Compared to 544% in QQQ

Total return is that good only because we are 20 years away from the last >99% loss crisis. You can't make that assumption for the future.

Assume that two investors invested the same amounts in TQQQ/QQQ respectively. According to your numbers with DCAing, we can say that the TQQQ investor has $5600 and the QQQ investor has $544, right?

- Hands on price shopping: As you’ve said, lots of people want to touch and feel the product before they buy, however MANY will still go shop online for better prices and delivery after viewing the product. BBY does not offer competitive incentives to ‘stick with them’ to the register.
- Almost half of their business comes from PC and Phone related sales yet those usually take up less than 1/3 of a store footprint and this revenue stream has STRONG competition from large, online, and boutique solutions.

So let's think about this a moment.

  
People who want to make a Green Energy play are investing money in basically the national equivalent of Netherlands. And they are Expecting Netherlands to defeat an Imperial Japan in WW2.

  
Let me tell you what happened to the Netherlands in the Pacific in WW2. Another time.

  
The point is, Big Oil has massive power, massive. Political power, financial power, huge treasuries, cash flows. Collectively the Big Oil industry has more money to piss away on research than the entire value of the Renewable Sector.

  
Right now an Oil company spends a $1.00 to get oil, and make $1.20 on that oil.

  
Right now a Renewable company spends a $1.00 on their respective renewable, and makes about $1.15 on that productivity.

  
Renewables can't invade the territory of Big Oil, but WHEN THE PRICE IS RIGHT Big oil can, AND WILL invade the Renewables' territory.

  
See where I'm going with this?  
Big Oil will:  
\- Wait until oil vs. renewable margins are closer.  
\- Invest in renewables.  
\- Use their political power to shut out anyone else  
\- Use their massive treasuries to shut out anyone else  
\- Use their propaganda machines and sheer weight to reduce the value of renewables and buy and absorb those companies into them when the price is right.

  
I therefore think the actual renewable play is Big Oil.

  
**Today's Big Oil is the future's Big Green.**

  
The Green Energy stocks of today are simply going to be gobbled up or shut down by the weight of oil companies when the profit margin of oil becomes closer to the profit margin of renewables.

**Because when EVs become popular, they will face massive headwind from energy grids and power production prices rising in response to new demand.**

63,CAN," When should I transition into using **MARGIN**?

I had a plan of how I want to go forward on moving from cash only, to margin, and I just don't know what criteria I should use.

Let's start with the basic criteria. If my portfolio choices earns average market returns, is margin right for me?

I would answer the con to that question, if I'm earning less than market returns then no, definitely not.

But when does margin impact your timeline?

Right now for instance, I have my money locked into a trade that wasn't the very bottom, fine, I have to hold it until I meet my targets. But the stock loses ground, let's say pulls back 4 or 5% in the time of my holding. **HOW CAN I TAKE ADVANTAGE** of a pullback when I believe the general trend is upward?

Margin comes to mind, but what if I'm wrong and it retrenches another 1 or 2% before finally climbing out of the retrenchment?

At what point do I get margin called, etc?

Does the margin call for me to sell the stock, or to add money to pay off the loss of value, and how do I determine what that costs me if the retrenchment is just temporary, a matter of days?

Thanks for any answers, it just helps me to formulate better questions later on.",DarthTrader357,1,/r/investing/comments/old2x9/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h5fxpca/,0.057,0.848,0.095,0.8261

If you're coming in to a field 10 or 20 years behind in research, just being big doesn't mean you're going to catch up in tech just like that. Look at what happened to IBM in the face of upstarts like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc.

Even if big companies can fund their own research later, that will put them a decade or more behind. Meanwhile, another big energy competitor could buy up several successful startups and quickly become the dominant player.

I see most people use ""5%"" for index fund portfolios, but I want to calculate it myself.

I see for example the [Canadian Couch Potato Model Portfolio](https://cdn.canadiancouchpotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CCP-Model-Portfolios-TD-e-Series-Dec2020.pdf) report do this for 2020, but it for the 10/15/20/25 year marks it only gives you the cumulative average.

97,CAT," > Solving this problem on a longer-term basis would include a lot of the policies the Liberals are pushing

In my opinion, this post toes the line of the political posting guidelines, and may cross them. I'd like to offer some counterpoints to the above statement, in hopes that we can keep the discussion relevant. I'm sure there is more nuance to this discussion than I am able to provide.

 - Increasing capital gains tax on the wealthiest does not, by itself, prop up the markets. There's an argument that it may reduce monetary velocity by increasing incentives for the wealthiest to never sell their holdings. At best, increased capital gains taxes may provide the government more money to either balance the budget or fund other initiatives. In the context of this sub, it's more interesting to discuss specific initiatives that could improve the economy.

 - Reducing the pay gap within companies could refer to several different things. I assume you mean the gap between executive salaries and entry-level wages (as opposed to gender pay gaps). If so, this has surprisingly small benefits. Taking CAT as an arbitrary example, eliminating the entire CEO's compensation package and dividing by the number of employees gives you an average of a $133/yr raise. Sure, there's more than one executive - but it's also unfair to take away the CEO's *entire* compensation. The current worker shortage is driving up wages for many factory positions by a larger amount than you're likely to achieve from cutting executive salaries. 

 - Are we sure that middle-to-lower class spending is down? It actually seems to be surging, driven by pent-up post-pandemic-lockdown demand. In my lcol area, there are plentiful entry-level jobs paying high $20's per hour. That's not riches, but in a low cost of living area that is enough to support a decent middle-class lifestyle. [Edit to clarify: I intended this to contrast with the ""keep doling out stimulus checks"" point. Many people seem to be finding higher-paying work instead of relying on stimulus checks.]

The market is down a little right now, but I see this as a healthy pullback. It may be nothing more than a brief correction during an extended bull market.",FinalDevice,1,/r/investing/comments/olpst2/a_simple_reason_why_the_wheels_are_falling_off/h5g0qbb/,0.059,0.835,0.106,0.9055

100,ESI," They’re in a market dominated by monopoly powers: ESI, Caremark, and Prime. Paying cash for generics is great but they’ll find it hard to incorporate high margin drugs where pharmacies make the most money. Volume is there though. If Amazons PillPack reaches the buying power discounts that GoodRx has they’ll have stiff competition there. I personally stay far away from retail pharmacy.",acihux,8,/r/investing/comments/ol94lk/possible_unicorn_stock_found/h5d2381/,0.044,0.895,0.062,0.2732
