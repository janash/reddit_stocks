56,AAPL," Wait, I thought we are here to lose money?? ;)
At this stage, that would be a tough calculation for me (although I’d say if I could do it over I’d go stocks)... but I think the more helpful way to look at it is from your perspective. What is the total amount of money you are talking about and assess some plausible options. Let’s say you have 150k for a down payment (around here you might be able to get a condo and then would get enough rent to cover mortgage and HOA, hopefully property tax and insurance - but let’s keep it simple and say it covers expenses and you build equity until the house is paid off). What can that same 150k get you in theta gang land? Over a thousand shares of AAPL and selling covered calls would probably allow you to make more money and then you can via rent and you can continually reinvest and grow that. Sure taxes are higher, but paying taxes really is a privilege. I will say that the covered call route does require some discipline though - and it’s a good idea to set up a mechanical approach to it (eg every Monday I sell weekly calls at x% above price; if I get assigned so be it; I dick around too much sometimes trying to time a pop/ increased IV/ etc a long term I don’t think it has paid off and is too much time investment). Does aapl beat house value increases long term... Who knows!",4chonkybonk,1,/r/investing/comments/opa3e5/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h654t55/,0.03,0.852,0.118,0.9732
57,IMO," Not really. You could try doing research, reading articles about the company but really trying to play earnings reports is IMO not a very good idea and definitely not something I try to do. Additionally, stock could run up into earnings and get to a point where it's priced for ""great"" and goes down because earnings were merely good. 

Or earnings are good and the forward commentary isn't great so the stock goes down (people are concerned more with forward-looking statements vs the quarter that just happened.)  Or maybe the market is ""risk off"" broadly during a period and people are more demanding and what looks like a good quarter on the surface might get sold off.

So many people come on here and go ""WHY IS MY STOCK DOWN EARNINGS WERE GOOD!?!?!"" and they're just looking at the headline that their co beat earnings, they didn't read the commentary or look at the guidance. 

Personally, earnings for me are sometimes a chance to pick something up if I think a negative reaction to earnings is overdone and it's a time to basically check up on how a company I own is doing and listen to the conference call.

59,CSCO," So what happened to you is called ""getting stopped out"" and it's a dumb risk that you never have to expose yourself to. I had fun in my last post but I'll explain more about what you ***probably should do.***

1. Buy 100 shares @ reasonable stock and price. If you like Amazon, CSCO may be reasonable alternative though it's in the 50s price range. Tech sector - strong - good dividend. Yatta yatta.
2. Sell a covered call @ strike price  you're willing to sell. Ideally put it in the expected move range. Delta = About 30. Or if you think the stock will go down (hence you want to sell out of it), sell a call at a strike somewhere in the money.
3. use the covered call to buy a put.
4. Using JPM as an example: Sell a covered call at $150 strike for $275 and buy a put for $117 dollars. You get paid $158 dollars to lock in a price between now and $149.
5. If the price is going to drop below $149 you simply buy back the covered call (Buy to Close) which will now be cheaper or if it falls out of the money you don't even need to worry about it, it expires worthless.
6. Exercise the put and sell your shares for $149, a price close to the top you wanted to sell out at anyway.

61,OUT," Why use a trailing limit order when you can use a put option? Sell a call at the price you want to sell at and the premium covers any down side as if a limit order is in place. Rinse and repeat if the price goes up by less than the strike at which you sold the call.

Collar it with a bought put order beneath a loss you can't afford, and roll-out and-up if price goes up.

You'll literally be punching money bags out of your stock and laughing the whole way to the bank at fools and their ""trailing limits"" while they sit and hope their stock does something and it just consolidates doing nothing for a month.

It's not so much that SPACs are robs, but investors should do DD regardless of IPO or SPAC unless they want to feel ""screwed over"".

There area many IPO mechanics such as the pre-ipo stage investors getting lower prices, ipo dilution to fill up company coffers, and the post-ipo lock-up period which serve to create an artificial floor for the stock's valuation which is often new, volatile, and not as ""set"" when it's new.

Back to SPACs. It really depends on the company. DFKG was a ""SPAC"" until it left that image behind. SPCE was a ""SPAC"" but can't seem to shake that image (imo because it's now a meme stock). You'd be up if you bought either early on. Doesn't mean there aren't SPACs like CLOV or the lordstown one which burned investors.

I think it's less about the way of going public but the company itself. The dilution and other factors are things to consider but that is something you do regardless of the way they go public. Those investor prospectus PDFs are readily accessible and exist for a reason. I didn't participate in either the ABNB IPO or the Sofi SPAC. I waited and bought ABNB after the lock-up period. Avoided Sofi because I read the prospectus and was concerned about the heavy dilution AND the number of early investors, Chamath, founders, early SPAC investors, and PIPE investors who all got in at or under $10. Avoided COIN despite liking the company because of their DPO wasn't reinvesting money back in, crypto was too hot, and COIN's valuation too bonkers. Others like DASH, I wouldn't buy regardless of IPO/DPO/SPAC/ICO/etc.",zxc123zxc123,3,/r/investing/comments/oph0bs/so_do_spacs_screw_over_equity_holders/h65ihvn/,0.047,0.91,0.044,-0.4784

The stock was trading at bankruptcy levels at $5 a share. The bull thesis was that the next gen of gaming consuls would have an optical drive thus giving GME several year more life.  The stock was priced near bankruptcy at $4 per share but hey if it had 6-7 years more life trading used games there may be some value there. What was the value ? Probably something like 10-20 per share what if you think about it is pretty great value a 100-400% gain.

So then ~~hedge funds~~  DFV started ~~pumping~~  promoting the stock on this realizing a few things. One there was actually value there when the stock was trading at $4 per share. Two it was very heavily shorted and much of the float was locked up making it a prime target for a short squeeze . So again the ~~hedge funds~~  DFV and crew started ~~Pumping~~  promoting the stock to retail and it did short squeezed

Then the stock took on a life of its own. Pumpers fed a whole slew of misinformation and conspiracy theories to retails trader that ate it up half truths and strait up lies about market makers, dark pools, how much of the stock is actually shorted and conviced a whole lot of people all they have to do is keep buying the stock and never sell and they will end up rich beyond their wildest dreams... sound familiar? Yea every televangelist scumbag does the same thing. They have convinced a large number of people their way to salvation is just keep buying GME an never sell, while laughing all the way to the bank.And just the the Televangelist they have true believer followers that they have duped.

Ok now lets talk about your specific questions

>Hedge funds have naked shorted GameStop and the “meme stocks” to oblivion, the entire float several times over.

This is now false. At one point maybe it was over 100% of float but most places now know its so volatile they need to hedge

>Retail (and some Institutions) have been buying and holding since January, owning more than the actual float.

Well this is half true retail has been buying a shit ton and holding but the whole float thing is way mis represteated

>Price is manipulated through dark pools, so even though these past days buy orders ounumber sell orders 7 to 1, it trades sideways or dips.

Pure mis information on people who do not know how ATS work

>These conditions have set up $GME to have the Mother of All Short Squeezes. If and when the short positions must close, their losses are theoretically infinite.

Pure mis information the short squeeze already happened. Melvin, the MM, Citadel do not have huge short positions they are scrambling to cover, its not going to go to 13 million a share.

88,GME," Saying you're learning more about markets from GME ""DD"" is like saying you're learning more about the universe by joining Heaven's Gate. That said, props for putting the topic out in this subreddit where you'll probably get nothing but contradictory views. Getting out of the comfy echo chamber from time to time is a good thing any way you slice it.

To start, there is no mother of all short squeezes on the horizon. The short squeeze already happened. Take whatever money you made on it and get out, there is no moon here. If, for whatever reason, you want to own GME for the future, buy back later when the price isn't insane.

Many of the things postulated on short squeezes are extremely ill-informed these days. There are those that are mechanically impossible -- these short numbers are high, therefore short squeeze, even if the volume outstrips it. There are the fabricated tactics, like the short ladder attack, which does not actually exist. There is a misunderstanding of how short reporting works, like how often it is compiled, the lag in which the numbers are gathered, and the criteria by which it's reported.

For example, a firm can complete a long sell order for a customer by shorting with another firm in order to manage inventory and lock in a price before purchasing the shares from the customer. This transaction is not really a short in how it's typically understood, especially by people who just started trading this year, yet if you ask FINRA, that's reported as a short transaction. It's also intentionally not offset in the reporting in order to keep overall volume consistent. That's also not accounting for things like synthetics and the countless other techniques that don't involve directly naked shorting -- something which is a lot more exclusive and less prevalent than people think.

As far as dark pools go, they're ultimately about block trading with the benefit of locking in a price so you don't get devalued securities in the process. Yes, there are some sketchy elements like HFT front-running, but that really has nothing to do with GME here. The buys relative to sells also aren't relevant. If there are excess people trying to buy, they simply aren't being filled.

Being bearish on GME =/= you think they're going bankrupt soon. The momentum play is over, GME will fall to a more reasonable valuation. On the reason why I'm bearish, it's because many of the talking points for why GME will be so great in the future are things similar companies have been saying for years. GME is not uniquely positioned to take advantage of things that others are not. Right now what they have is a second chance and some brand recognition, but that alone doesn't secure anything for them, especially since expectations are so high from supporters for their fundamentals. When I can see a GME DCF model and be impressed, I'd look at them closer. But certainly not right now.

In short, GME was a one-time thing. For those who took advantage of it, nice work. But I feel like too many people are now in the ""get rich quick"" boat and think they know far more than they do. There is an omnipresent meme collective right now convincing everyone they have it all figured out, and a lot of what it's based on is either very basic, or misunderstood.",BuzzardBlack,12,/r/investing/comments/op00jd/your_thoughts_on_gme_thesis/h62p3re/,0.057,0.813,0.13,0.9931

Full disclosure: I am also not a day trader. My own DD methodology for non-startups is a bit... antiquated?

Maybe in the future we will have official news the development of new revenue venues or acquisitions and It'll be more attractive.

96,GME," Run away, Let's look at what happens for your investment return if you sold today, or in 10 years:  


Today's market cap: $13.4 Billion

If you sold $100 of GME today, and invested it into the total market or the S&P500, your expected return is roughly 10% a year (8% with inflation), so 1.1\^10 = 2.59 \* $100 = $259  


GME would have to raise its current market cap to \~$35 Billion in that time. 2.5X current overvalue today. They're in the gaming space, so let's look at a wildly succesful game company: Nintendo. Their market cap? \~$78 Billion.   


Do you think gamestop can get to 1/2 of Nintendo's market cap from games/branding/etc in ten years?   


If so, great! You've just **matched the market**. To be a great investment, you would expect it to *beat* the market in that time. So gamestop has to approach the value of nintendo as they are today. Nintendo has a theme park. Part of the pokemon brand, consoles, mario, etc. Gamestop has a bunch of work to do, and it's going to be darn near impossible to do that in 10 years....  


So I would argue: Pull out, they aren't worth holding as of this very day. If it dropped another 50% at some *future date*, then *maybe*.",exe_virus,4,/r/investing/comments/op00jd/your_thoughts_on_gme_thesis/h62n4u4/,0.02,0.918,0.062,0.904
97,GME," I made an account just to join WSB around the time GME blew up, people betting on tattoos or eating crayons cracked me up and I wanted a front row seat. That said, it's one of many meme stocks now. They tend to have great volatility for scalping but have a short shelf life as well.

Is the long term thesis valid? Perhaps, but I see nothing compelling to say it is. My position was exited at a slight loss because it crossed defined thresholds for when to cut it loose. IMO a well defined strategy, followed strictly, should beat the latest tulip mania any day. In time I may be proven wrong but, again, I doubt it.",T0asterFork,1,/r/investing/comments/op00jd/your_thoughts_on_gme_thesis/h625tf0/,0.142,0.783,0.075,-0.859

99,GME, $15 would put the company valued less then the cash on the books. It’s ok not to like GME but please don’t claim x stock is worth y on feels.,AtrumCanis,1,/r/investing/comments/op00jd/your_thoughts_on_gme_thesis/h62celr/,0.047,0.689,0.265,0.7427
100,GME," Sure, but the problem with that is I can go and place an order right now to buy 1,000,000 shares of GME at $0.01 and all of a sudden there are a million more buy orders than sell orders.

All those buy orders mean nothing if they're nowhere close to the actual current value of the stock. A lot of them are buy orders at say $15 a share.

Also pretty much every one of the ""shorted greater than float"" arguments have been debunked many times over.

The real question is can they change their business model enough to survive, but no one has really come up with a compelling business model they are going for. There's about a dozen different ways that different people have put forward, but imo that's even worse. A bunch of fragmented ideas is far worse than no idea.

Also Ryan Cohen knows he's getting paid no matter what. Plenty of business people have been one-hit wonders, just because he made it big with Chewy doesn't mean he's a golden god.",AmbitiousEconomics,6,/r/investing/comments/op00jd/your_thoughts_on_gme_thesis/h623qkc/,0.12,0.759,0.121,-0.4118
