3,AMD," From [Seeking Alpha](https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/news/3724985-xilinx-deal-spread-with-advanced-micro-devices-widens-to-highest-ever):

The deal spread between Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) had widened to $65/share, or about 45%, the highest since the deal was announced in October. Xilinx fell 3.7%, while AMD rose 5.9%. Several other technology deals that also need Chinese antitrust approval also saw their spreads widen today.

One reason for Xilinx's (XLNX) move down may be that risk arb investors can't handle the potential downside for Xilinx (XLNX) if a deal with AMD (AMD) were to fall apart as AMD's shares continue to rocket higher, according to CNBC's David Faber. CNBC's Jim Cramer also said he believed that AMD (AMD) has become a meme stock at this point. AMD shares have jumped almost 25% in the past two weeks.

In addition a Dealreporter column from last night may be contributing to weakness in the spreads. The opinion piece points out that China's leaders appear to have changed their tone about the importance of technology in late May and may have put the country on a ""technology war footing."" The U.S. and South Korean's announcement to fund multi-billion dollar semiconductor factories may also have contributed to China's potential slowdown on approving the U.S. deals.

As far as Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) planned purchase of Maxim (NASDAQ:MXIM), the Dealreporter column says the timing is uncertain. Last month traders circulated a report that the timing for Chinese approval had moved out as some customer have issues with export controls, though the deal was still likely to be approved.

Risk arb investors may also be ""de-risking"" due to heightened antitrust risk after Aon (NYSE:AON) and Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW) abandoned their $30B deal last week after the U.S. sued to block the deal and after a report from The Information last night that the U.S. DOJ is considering filing a lawsuit to block UnitedHealth's planned $8B purchase of Changed Healthcare (NASDAQ:CHNG).

Last month MLex reported that the AMD's (AMD) purchase of Xilinx (XLNX) is expect to see a Phase Two review by Chinese antitrust regulators. China's State Administration for Market Regulation or SAMR is believed to have reached out to industry participants a few months ago to find out their views on market definitions and market shares.

Other deal spreads that are wider today include Maxim (MXIM)/Analog Devices (ADI) and Coherent (NASDAQ:COHR)/II-VI(NASDAQ:IIVI).

Also last week it was reported that China's review of Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) planned purchase of Arm Holdings (ARMHF) was said to be delayed. China's antitrust regulatory hasn't started its formal review of the deal for Softbank to sell Arm to Nvidia, according to a report from The Information.",az2123,31,/r/investing/comments/oxuz0n/xilinx_is_now_trading_at_about_a_thirds_discount/h7p4bdq/,0.066,0.886,0.048,-0.8074

Whether or not you'd still have the foreign ordinary shares (BABAF on the OTC) I dunno but not something I'd count on. Delisting is delisting as far as I'm aware, not delisting from major exchanges. Luckin was delisted not because of a regulatory ban it was delisted because it was bankrupt and a fraud.

Additionally, with OTC there are rule changes that will take place by September that will stop trading in anything not current in terms of filings (and the specifics - IMO - are not entirely crystal clear.) We'll see how things go in the months ahead but at this point investing in international names via OTC is something that I'm somewhat concerned about.

58,IMO," There wasn't much unexpected in this talk. Almost no movement in markets yesterday. 

I don't think there was an expectation for him to ""take a very soft line"". In his MIT Blockchain course he's openly positive on ""Satoshi's innovation"" but a strong proponent of regulation particularly with alts and this talk was in line with that. If you watch any of Hester Pierce's interviews she's been saying the same thing out of the SEC. 

My biggest takeaway was how much he stressed many altcoins are at risk of being ruled securities. This is a big risk to them but neutral to positive for the majors.

61,CHPT," Tritium makes charging hardware and is going public under the DCFC ticker symbol (SPAC). I know very little about them.

CHPT - Chargepoint - Their business model relies on the sales of cloud services to partners that provide colorful reports on charger utilization. The partner provides the power and in many cases the maintenance as well. Each charger nets them at least $300/year in revenue, with more if the customer buys a maintenance plan.

EVGo - EVGo builds the infrastructure and pays for the power, and profits based upon how they bill customers. Their primary revenue source is customers using the network. Their prices are a bit high, but they are working on getting really valuable locations.  


BLINK - They revenue share with the site hosting the charger and are mostly installing low-reliability chargers at usage prices that make gas look dirt cheap. Without a major change in their business model, I don't see this going far, but the upside is that low information site hosts (often in the hospitality industry) find them appealing.

VOLTA - Advertising based free charging. The way I see it, these guys have figured out a way to buy billboard space in high traffic areas for <$100/month in operational costs. Its a really clever business model. Not sure how sustainable it is, but maybe?

Electrify America & Tesla Superchargers - Automaker subsidiaries, so not independently traded. Probably closest business model-wise to EVGo, though with slightly different pricing strategies.

83,USA," 25F USA

Interested in buying an ATM as passive income, looking for insight/information on it. I am employed, just looking to start some passive income that can get me a couple hundred a month thats pretty low maintenance. Risk tolerance- I'd ideally like to make back the money I put into the machine. I have no big debts.

So I'm looking into it as a passive income source. My understanding is the prices of an ATM vary from 1.5-10k. You fill it with your own money. Charge a withdrawal fee. Share a part of the fee with the business owner who's store you put the machine in. Apparently can make you 200-700 a month based on the traffic it gets. 

I'm curious about more of the details, but don't really know where to look. For example, what are features I should look for on an atm machine, or what should I avoid? How is it taxed? How do I approach a business and ask to put an atm in there store? What type of businesses should i consider asking? How do I transport the atm? What sort of precautions should I take to protect the money I front to put into the machine? Is there insurance for it? What happens if the machine malfunctions? What happens if my machine has an atm card skimmer put into it, would I get in trouble or owe money?

So theoretically the 220k is your max loss on the contract assuming SP500 goes to zero and you have the cash in your account. However, once you run out of cash to cover your positions they will liquidate you.
