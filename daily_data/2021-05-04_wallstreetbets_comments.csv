151,RH," This intuitively makes sense for a larger account, but not smaller.

If standard commission to place a trade is $5 and I'm instead buying $250 of stock on RH, I'm gonna notice if it fills at $255.  So the PFOF price fucking has to be pretty small.  [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-free-trading-on-robinhood-isnt-really-free-1541772001) gave an example of $5 for a $20k trade.

If I find the time and energy, maybe I'll look into the SEC report and see what the % findings are.  But I believe RH is much, much cheaper for accounts under ~$50-100K.

How would they hedge your trades? You think they’re selling you the calls themselves? Or shorting the positions you buy? Or buying puts on what you’re trading?

That’s so asinine I can’t believe I’m responding to this 

Casinos don’t make money by being on the opposite end of every bet. That would be the quickest way to fold. They make money by getting a tiny piece of the action. RH does that through payment for order flow. 

If you’re making $50-100k and up trades, the small price improvement some can offer might make them better. But for the majority of people flipping meme stocks or momentum plays in relatively small accounts, you’re saving money with this business model versus paying $5 per trade. And if you’re trading more like an institution where the price improvement matters more than the commission per trade, you’re a fucktard for trading like that on RH to begin with

203,REAL," 20,000 shares and warrants accumulated since May 2020. I've ridden this wave up and down several times. Could I sell for a very healthy profit sure. Have I seen its value swing down 50k from its high yes. I'd rather let this company do its thing rather than try to time things. 1 year in and there hasn't been a single bad thing that's come out of the company. Actually it's all been great news. 

Yes the price is volatile but thats showbiz baby. The potential gains by holding are astronomical and I would be kicking myself for selling out. I'd rather see that 20k burn to 0 than get out before REAL catalysts for short term profit. 

The money right now isn't life changing and nor do I need it right now. Thats called proper risk tolerance and analysis. But if they even hit on 1 FDA approval, then the money starts to become life changing. They get several approvals and breakthrough status...I'm probably considering retiring before 40.

If price blows past short strike, you wont profit much, but you just close out the entire position for net even or small profit and repeat cuz lol NOKIA is range bound AF. As you lock in more profits from the CC, it hurts even less to close out entire position. 

Nokia - IV is pretty shit right now, so premiums aren't great, but it's cool. This is death by 1000 cuts. If I can make 3-5% every 6 weeks, that's still a decent 20%-40% per year.

516,CLOV," Calls are options, a derivative of the stock.  Its a contract where the buyer of the call is buying the right to purchase the stock at the strike price by the date of the contract.  So if a call is listed at .60 5/21 $12 you are paying $0.60/share (calls are contracts of 100 shares, so it would cost $60) for the right to buy the shares for $12 by 5/21.  On 5/22, if the price of the stock isn't at least $12.01, the contract expires worthless.  Also consider that you paid a premium of $0.60/share, so your breakeven wouldn't be until it's above $12.60/share.

If the stock went to $13/share, you'd be getting a discount of $0.40/share and could immediately sell the shares for $40 profit.  Most people that are interested in the quick money like that won't even buy the shares, they'll sell their contract as it would then be worth like $2.00/share if it goes well above the strike price before expiration.  Then you're looking at a profit of $140 for example.

I think only like 8% of contracts are actually exercised.  23% expire worthless and 69% are sold/closed before expiration.

&#x200B;

If you already own shares of CLOV (at least 100) you could write a contract that would obligate you to sell your shares if the contract went into the money.  The reason most people do this is because they don't think it will actually hit that price within that timeframe and they pocket the premium up front.  So the writer of our call from the above example gets $0.60/share up front = $60.  If the contract expires worthless, they keep the whole $60.  Most people will buy to close the contract as it gets close to $0, so maybe they buy to close for $10 and pocket $50.

If the contract does go into the money and they don't close out, they keep the profit on the shares, up to the contract price, plus the premium they received for the contract.  So again, using our above example, if the stock was at $10 when they wrote the $12 call, but it goes up to $13, they sell 100 shares at $12 each, plus the $0.60 in premium, so $2.60 profit per share ($260 total profit).  They miss out on that extra $0.40, but hey, profit is profit.

EDIT: Also, if you're able to sell multiple contracts over a few weeks or months, you're indirectly bringing down your cost basis.  So if you pocketed like $0.60/share 4 times and you had bought in at $12.00, you're really at like $10.60/share without having bought more shares to average down.  Then you can sell for profit at like $11, even though you bought in at $12.

in the world of moonshot spacs, I actually think OPEN had a shot. Their concept is pretty simple - buy houses fast via the web and flip em. clear business model, clear profit model. platform that actually works.

in terms of other weird meme-ish shit, I'm interested in seeing how BB will do. the people who keep saying they have $3B worth in patents are nuts. Some of their cell phone tech is from a decade ago. It's not worth shit anymore. That said, they do have a nice enterprise tech for cars. Maybe it'll be a big market player. They need to reinvent themselves. At their current valuation and share price, it's might be worth checking out. And they're liquid enough to wheel options on if you caught bag holding.

In terms of healthcare/pharma:

I'm interested in Kempharm: approved ADHD drug, reaching early sales/licensing milestones. Upside if the drug takes off. It's nothing revolutionary, but its a pro-drug platform that delivers longer lasting active metabolite. Smoother curve, maybe less addictive.

EOL - approved for competition to botox. Overcame a major import/trade dispute allowing them to start sales in the US. Just recently diluted shares majorly at 9.50, so I expect price will hang around there until a quarter or two of earnings, etc. Might be a good time to enter though.

SIEN - they make breast implants. They're decently cheap right now simply because COVID shutdowns and a number of pre-covid issues really hamstrunged them. Price is low enough to consider entering and seeing how it cosmetic and reconstructive breast surgery will recover.

ENDP - they have a decent pharmaceutical compounding business, a number of fun random proprietary drugs for stuff like dupuytrens and cellulite. However they also selling narcs and are getting sued. that's their major headwind and their stock has gotten pounded by it. It's at 5-6 dollars. I'm in simply on the bet that they will settle their liabilities, survive/get acquired/sell off assets, and price will gain at some point.

None of these companies is perfect, but they have a reasonable valuation and business models that can actually achieve profit. I'll take my chances with them, if I'm going to be doing a wallstreet bet.

2)You are \~33$ below ATH, which does give you visible upside.

However, it is not the worst one I have seen so far. Taking a 2nd mortgage on your house (if true) for Twitter is pretty stupid BUT you bought shares and not options so you will be able to save value (probably).   


Honestly, there are WAY better plays out there for a YOLO. TWTR really hasn't done much since debut, their PPC is not as cost-effective as rival platforms, and companies are worried about the toxic content so are wary of advertising.

If I were to YOLO (and I do) I would go for something like the Proterra/Arclight merger (buy shares but 6/18 call options are for the REAL tendies.....and losses).

XLNX shareholders are getting 1.7234 shares of AMD in exchange for their XLNX shares. XLNX has 245.77m shares outstanding. This means 423.56m shares of AMD will be issued to XLNX shareholders. This equals an increase of $33b in market cap in regard to AMDs current price. 

BUT here’s the kicker. AMD gets about $31b worth of stuff (namely all of XLNX’s assets/their market cap). AMD probably reaps some benefits in the form of synergies as well. 

How much? Who knows. Maybe AMD is overpaying a tad maybe they are getting a good deal in terms of the savings they reap with consolidation. But any move upward in XLNX should at least allow AMD to follow.

BUT here’s the kicker. AMD gets about $31b worth of stuff (namely all of XLNX’s assets/their market cap). AMD probably reaps some benefits in the form of synergies as well. 

How much? Who knows. Maybe AMD is overpaying a tad maybe they are getting a good deal in terms of the savings they reap with consolidation. But any move upward in XLNX should at least allow AMD to follow.

736,AMD," "" Current shareholders of AMD own less of the company now. That’s simply a fact. ""

What you're not seeing is the share dilution will be equal to the acquisition. So once the merger is complete the value should more or less be the same.  

It's like borrowing money to build an extension to your house. Yes, you pick up greater debt but that debt goes into the value of the house. So sure, on the surface it looks like a loss for current shareholders if you don't include the value of the acquisition to the acquiring company but that would be an oversight.

And they would just throw money at you in the form of gifts; like iPads, expensive jackets, gift cards, etc. It was also impossible to get fired.

998,OR," Follow the math:  you’re in at ~$21, current prices ~$12.50, down $8.50.  You obviously feel the shares are going to go up, so here goes:

You SELL 73 (or as much as you want to try, 50?) June 4 $12.50 CALLS and collect ~$7600, you also SELL the August 20 $10 PUT collecting ~$11,000 so you bring in $18,500.  Now you hold your shares with 2 option short posns. One covered the other (Put) naked but limited risk.

Scenarios 
1. Stock moves up to ???  $20
You KEEP the $11,000
You must sell your shares at $12.50 getting $91,250 minus the premium you Rec’d of $18,500 from puts.  Your net loss $47,500 which gives you the ability to take the loss and deduction but also allows you to buy it back at a much lower cost basis OR temporarily buy calls OR sell puts to reestablish the posn.

2. Shares drop to $7.50, you still receive the same $18,500 and u must BUY the shares at $10 (strike price of the puts) on August 20, ~60 days later with a net cost of $75,000-$18,500=$56,500 a net cost of ~$7.75/share.  


$157,000 + $75,000= $232,000  - $18,500 + $100,000 =  $113,500   New cost per share after all trades settle is $15.50 down from $21 and you still hold the same number of shares 7300 with the ability to hold or $$$ but if you are correct and the stock does go up you’ll make more due to $6 lower cost, it reads complicated but it’s not if you write numbers and do math in chronological order.  If you feel the shares will move up $3-$4 points before June 4, 30 days, this isn’t the perfect scenario for you, any other share price it’s good.",Thestockbroker22,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4q0ye/fsr_yolo_may_update/gwx92ae/,0.06,0.812,0.129,0.9638
