151,RH," This intuitively makes sense for a larger account, but not smaller.

If standard commission to place a trade is $5 and I'm instead buying $250 of stock on RH, I'm gonna notice if it fills at $255.  So the PFOF price fucking has to be pretty small.  [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-free-trading-on-robinhood-isnt-really-free-1541772001) gave an example of $5 for a $20k trade.

If I find the time and energy, maybe I'll look into the SEC report and see what the % findings are.  But I believe RH is much, much cheaper for accounts under ~$50-100K.

Casinos don‚Äôt make money by being on the opposite end of every bet. That would be the quickest way to fold. They make money by getting a tiny piece of the action. RH does that through payment for order flow. 

If you‚Äôre making $50-100k and up trades, the small price improvement some can offer might make them better. But for the majority of people flipping meme stocks or momentum plays in relatively small accounts, you‚Äôre saving money with this business model versus paying $5 per trade. And if you‚Äôre trading more like an institution where the price improvement matters more than the commission per trade, you‚Äôre a fucktard for trading like that on RH to begin with

203,REAL," 20,000 shares and warrants accumulated since May 2020. I've ridden this wave up and down several times. Could I sell for a very healthy profit sure. Have I seen its value swing down 50k from its high yes. I'd rather let this company do its thing rather than try to time things. 1 year in and there hasn't been a single bad thing that's come out of the company. Actually it's all been great news. 

Yes the price is volatile but thats showbiz baby. The potential gains by holding are astronomical and I would be kicking myself for selling out. I'd rather see that 20k burn to 0 than get out before REAL catalysts for short term profit. 

The money right now isn't life changing and nor do I need it right now. Thats called proper risk tolerance and analysis. But if they even hit on 1 FDA approval, then the money starts to become life changing. They get several approvals and breakthrough status...I'm probably considering retiring before 40.

If price blows past short strike, you wont profit much, but you just close out the entire position for net even or small profit and repeat cuz lol NOKIA is range bound AF. As you lock in more profits from the CC, it hurts even less to close out entire position. 

Nokia - IV is pretty shit right now, so premiums aren't great, but it's cool. This is death by 1000 cuts. If I can make 3-5% every 6 weeks, that's still a decent 20%-40% per year.

516,CLOV," Calls are options, a derivative of the stock.  Its a contract where the buyer of the call is buying the right to purchase the stock at the strike price by the date of the contract.  So if a call is listed at .60 5/21 $12 you are paying $0.60/share (calls are contracts of 100 shares, so it would cost $60) for the right to buy the shares for $12 by 5/21.  On 5/22, if the price of the stock isn't at least $12.01, the contract expires worthless.  Also consider that you paid a premium of $0.60/share, so your breakeven wouldn't be until it's above $12.60/share.

If the stock went to $13/share, you'd be getting a discount of $0.40/share and could immediately sell the shares for $40 profit.  Most people that are interested in the quick money like that won't even buy the shares, they'll sell their contract as it would then be worth like $2.00/share if it goes well above the strike price before expiration.  Then you're looking at a profit of $140 for example.

I think only like 8% of contracts are actually exercised.  23% expire worthless and 69% are sold/closed before expiration.

&#x200B;

If you already own shares of CLOV (at least 100) you could write a contract that would obligate you to sell your shares if the contract went into the money.  The reason most people do this is because they don't think it will actually hit that price within that timeframe and they pocket the premium up front.  So the writer of our call from the above example gets $0.60/share up front = $60.  If the contract expires worthless, they keep the whole $60.  Most people will buy to close the contract as it gets close to $0, so maybe they buy to close for $10 and pocket $50.

If the contract does go into the money and they don't close out, they keep the profit on the shares, up to the contract price, plus the premium they received for the contract.  So again, using our above example, if the stock was at $10 when they wrote the $12 call, but it goes up to $13, they sell 100 shares at $12 each, plus the $0.60 in premium, so $2.60 profit per share ($260 total profit).  They miss out on that extra $0.40, but hey, profit is profit.

EDIT: Also, if you're able to sell multiple contracts over a few weeks or months, you're indirectly bringing down your cost basis.  So if you pocketed like $0.60/share 4 times and you had bought in at $12.00, you're really at like $10.60/share without having bought more shares to average down.  Then you can sell for profit at like $11, even though you bought in at $12.

SIEN - they make breast implants. They're decently cheap right now simply because COVID shutdowns and a number of pre-covid issues really hamstrunged them. Price is low enough to consider entering and seeing how it cosmetic and reconstructive breast surgery will recover.

ENDP - they have a decent pharmaceutical compounding business, a number of fun random proprietary drugs for stuff like dupuytrens and cellulite. However they also selling narcs and are getting sued. that's their major headwind and their stock has gotten pounded by it. It's at 5-6 dollars.

736,AMD," "" Current shareholders of AMD own less of the company now. That‚Äôs simply a fact. ""

What you're not seeing is the share dilution will be equal to the acquisition. So once the merger is complete the value should more or less be the same.  

It's like borrowing money to build an extension to your house. Yes, you pick up greater debt but that debt goes into the value of the house. So sure, on the surface it looks like a loss for current shareholders if you don't include the value of the acquisition to the acquiring company but that would be an oversight.

998,OR," Follow the math:  you‚Äôre in at ~$21, current prices ~$12.50, down $8.50.  You obviously feel the shares are going to go up, so here goes:

You SELL 73 (or as much as you want to try, 50?) June 4 $12.50 CALLS and collect ~$7600, you also SELL the August 20 $10 PUT collecting ~$11,000 so you bring in $18,500.  Now you hold your shares with 2 option short posns. One covered the other (Put) naked but limited risk.

Scenarios 
1. Stock moves up to ???  $20
You KEEP the $11,000
You must sell your shares at $12.50 getting $91,250 minus the premium you Rec‚Äôd of $18,500 from puts.  Your net loss $47,500 which gives you the ability to take the loss and deduction but also allows you to buy it back at a much lower cost basis OR temporarily buy calls OR sell puts to reestablish the posn.

2. Shares drop to $7.50, you still receive the same $18,500 and u must BUY the shares at $10 (strike price of the puts) on August 20, ~60 days later with a net cost of $75,000-$18,500=$56,500 a net cost of ~$7.75/share.  


$157,000 + $75,000= $232,000  - $18,500 + $100,000 =  $113,500   New cost per share after all trades settle is $15.50 down from $21 and you still hold the same number of shares 7300 with the ability to hold or $$$ but if you are correct and the stock does go up you‚Äôll make more due to $6 lower cost, it reads complicated but it‚Äôs not if you write numbers and do math in chronological order.  If you feel the shares will move up $3-$4 points before June 4, 30 days, this isn‚Äôt the perfect scenario for you, any other share price it‚Äôs good.",Thestockbroker22,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4q0ye/fsr_yolo_may_update/gwx92ae/,0.06,0.812,0.129,0.9638

1001,IMO," KKR is selling a block of shares it already owned, this is not dilutive, it will however increase the float.   This not unusual for private equity,  they typically IPO a decent chunk of the company, and then slowly whittle the size of their position down through block trades or secondary offerings so that they can focus on other opportunities.

Management has indicated a willingness to buy back up to $100m of stock.  Why, I'm not sure, I guess to reassure investors that they're bullish.  IMO, they should focus on paying down debt and getting their credit rating back to investment grade.

High margins on ammo right now is helping their profit margins.  Whomever said guns and ammo was only 10% of sales, can you point me towards what call that was on?  Didn't see it in the earnings transcript.
