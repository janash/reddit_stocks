I just wonder about their monetization. Actually surprised by how many people shell out for the nitro already. share larger files? Meh, I’ll just upload to streamable and link it.  Boost someone’s server so they can have more emotes? meh. there’s some other features but it’s not worth $10 to me. And for those who do get it, probably the first thing they cut when rebudgeting. 

Just seems like a lot is being left on the table from a monetezation standpoint. It’s massively popular but completely free and the paid benefits simply aren’t at all enticing to most people.

72,AAPL," To answer you question, OP, these are block trades typically made by large hedge funds with terms agreed on well in advance and off the main exchanges.

It's possible that yesterday (or earlier) two funds agreed to exchange 3.5M AAPL shares (that's the volume I see on ToS) at precisely the Mar 22 opening price (or any other agreed-on price). This trade could happen any time (including after hours), but it's not true liquiditty that other traders could take advantage of. The block trade just happened to be reported after-hours when AAPL was trading at a different price.

73,GP," Things in private equity/venture capital do not work the same way as public markets. There is no standard of reporting and “accredited investor” is a proxy for financial literacy. Projections can be extremely rosy and the assumption is you have the ability to dig into things enough to test their projections and push back. 

You’re going to need to understand exactly what you’re buying. Are you buying into a fund (partnership) that owns the company stock? If so, what are the costs, incentives and rights the GP have (could they keep the partnership open even if the stock goes public so you never actually get the shares)? If you’re getting shares directly, where do you sit in the cap structure? Employees are typically granted common stock but each VC round is typically a class of preferred equity that has a liquidation preference above each previous round and all are above the common. If things go well, all the preferred gets converted to common so you need to understand how the dilution works. If things don’t go well or even just ok. The VC firms could potentially sell the company for a value that leaves little to no value for the common equity. 

How do these platforms make their money? Is it a fee to broker the transaction or are they also making a spread (they bought the shares from the employees at $10 and you’re buying from them at $15)?

77,MSFT," I’m a MSFT bull. I feel like they have still a lot of room to grow in long term with Azure and LinkedIn like you said. I think you have underrated the Xbox and gaming segment. They have seen more growth than LinkedIn in the most recent quarter when looking at yoy growth.

Also you are under estimating the Office 365 segment in my opinion. **It hasn’t never been about consumer, it’s been about the 365 commercial and providing it to other businesses.** Office 365 is super popular in a work environment and they hold a strong market there. Don’t see anyone cutting their market share significantly. Their revenue growth has been very good in the Office 365 consumer segment. 

Microsoft’s balance sheet is also a thing that impresses me alot. Their credit rating is AAA, the highest possible (which is very rare) and their huge cash holdings can cover all of their  long term debt.

One other factor that you didn’t take in count is their management. Satya Nadella is a very intelligent person who has turned Microsoft entirely. He has been there since the 90s and know the ins and outs of the business.

So with these factors and the possible acquiry of Discord with also the boat load of cash, I sense more value in Microsoft than you do.",juaggo_,15,/r/stocks/comments/mbjr24/microsoft_msft_dd_sitting_on_a_gold_mine/gryii2t/,0.027,0.797,0.176,0.9876

I have no experience with Saleforce, but I haven't personally met any fans.

Regarding Xbox, I would like to see you expound on their position compared to Playstation. My understanding is that MS has moved beyond just consoles, arrogantly claiming they aren't in the same industry anymore, and are building a Netflix-like game subscription service in their GamePass Ultimate. Many of these games offer cross-platform capabilities between Xbox, PC, or even mobile with the Xcloud technology. I also saw articles today that MS is looking to acquire Discord, a multiplatform voice and text chat software, for $10bn. I get the impression MS is willing to put an Xbox app on the Playstation console if Sony will allow it.

I will acknowledge that historically Playstation has led the console wars with a more expansive selection of exclusive AAA titles. Microsoft's acquisition of Zenimax Studios was just made official and brings in a significant selection of AAA intellectual property. Zenimax seems to be the capstone on a buying spree of studios over the last two years. It seems like Xbox has already positioned itself to give Playstation a run for its money in the near future.

I don't think netflix should be in this crowd , even tho it's FAANG, it's a younger company (comparably) and it's expected to reinvest more money into the company.

134,IMO," Fujitsu just put in docs with the FCC for approval of their tri-band remote radio heads (RRH) that covers 5g n26 (800MHz), n29 (lower 700MHz), and n71 (600MHz). That means they should be delivering them to Dish soon if they haven't already started.

Dish hasn't bought n26 from the new T-Mobile yet, but it also acts as further confirmation that they plan to since there's no reason to include it otherwise.

Good sign to not expect further delays in their network build IMO.

EDIT: Correction-the FCC just APPROVED their application, so from the FCC's perspective they can deploy whenever they want.

Some of these companies might never see these highs again, but more realistically this was ""a"" top and will look miniscule compared to another ""top"" in the future (5-10 years later).",tmillwr8,1,/r/stocks/comments/mbfao4/playing_catch_up_sucks/grz5let/,0.0,0.846,0.154,0.9643

191,APR," The bond yield increasing is not bad for the market! It is actually a very good thing for our whole system. The problem is that a ton of people are leveraged into speculative plays that are not profitable (which is why there is a bunch of negative sentiment). These companies have to borrow money in the debt market to continue operating - they do this through corporate bond offerings (or share dilution in the equity market), this comes with the promise that the company will pay their creditors back in a few years at a certain APR. If interest rates in the medium/long-term go up, then it becomes more difficult for these companies to grow, since they’ll have to pay more of their income in interest payments, rather than continued growth. They can avoid this by writing shorter dated bonds, but they’ll have to be able to repay the entirety of the loan sooner, rather than later, which has it’s own slew of issues.

The bond yields also affect a lot more than just what companies can borrow money it, it also affects - student loans, mortgages, savings accounts, margin loans, basically any loan you can get in the US.",ABA61,26,/r/stocks/comments/mayx8s/can_someone_explain_whats_going_on_with_bond/grv0j0d/,0.066,0.848,0.086,0.4703
192,FB," The rise in yield not only give investors an alternative to stocks, but also raises capital cost for companies (ie cost more to borrow), therefore it's terrible for growth companies that reply on borrowing to grow. 

The bond market is dynamic, in the long run, the yield will obviously rise. In the short run though, the yield may experience a pullback and this may trigger another tech run.

You see, fed signaled no rate increase til 2024, even with our fast economic recovery. But the bond vililantes (yes that's an actual term, go look it up) protested by selling bonds and FORCED the yield to rise. They protested because when economy recovers, you are supposed to signal increase in rates (Econ 101). But fed didn't do that. However, as the yield rise, many bonds investors, such as the Japanese gov, will jump in and buy the bonds, which will lower the yield. 

Fed can also jump in and buy bonds but it may not work because in order to buy bonds they have to print even more money, which is obviously inflationary (ie, fed losing control of the bond market). Nasty stuff.

In other words, we are in unchartered territory and its kind of scary. You just don't know. But in the short run, tech (especially high tech - FB barely has any debt) should have another run. Enjoy the ride.",ajna6688,3,/r/stocks/comments/mayx8s/can_someone_explain_whats_going_on_with_bond/grvywq0/,0.119,0.816,0.065,-0.937
193,AI," Sometimes that is a glitch, sometimes that is an order that is canceled, sometimes it's algorithms.

E.g., a computer may sell and then buy the stock to itself (or it's buddies) in a nanosecond. There is a lot of wonky shit that happens with FTD's, AI, etc. It might put in an order then immediately cancel it to ""probe"" the market or for some other trick. 

Remember though, it isn't the volume that changes the price. The price is changed based on supply and demand, what people are willing to pay.

So if the price is 3$ and you are willing to buy it then it's just an exchange of the stock for 3$. Volume increased BUT the price hasn't. But if you are only willing to buy for 2.99$ then something has to give. Either you have to go up(the price increases) or the seller has to come down(the price decreases).

Volume really has nothing to do with it except it sorta measures how often this ""bargaining"" is occurring(not telling you in which direction, that is the price).

The price can change drastically with just one share. If, say, you will only pay 1$ and the seller comes down to 1$ then the price dropped 2$! Even with just one share. Of course it really depends on what every one else is doing. If no one else will sell at 1$ then it will rise back up.

You can think of the stock price as the price at which people, on average, are agreeing to buying and selling the stock. When there is a disagreement the price changes but it depends on all the buyers and sellers as a collective. You can go sell a 100$ stock for 1$ and it will be bought up real quick, you will lose 99$, it won't change the price much because no one else is going sell it that cheap. Now if you sell a large number of stock(e.g., naked shorting) you can drive the price down because now there is plenty of supply to provide to people.

So, also you have to take in to account supply and demand. But it's very complex because you have all the traders with their different ideas of what it they are doing. The stock price is the ""average"" overall price at whcih all this takes place. It doesn't mean it is the correct price and it doesn't' mean it can't be manipulated or weird stuff can happen. It simply means that this is the price at which pretty much everyone is working off of more or less, at least in theory.

As an individual all you can really do is figure out what you think the stock is worth buying or selling for and buy or sell it at that price. This is why fundamentals are so important, this is what tries to help you understand the market rather than just flip a coin. You can get lucky, sure, but you can also get unlucky.

I don't think it is all that important to know why the stock price is what it is, because the reasons are myriad and too complex(it is good to have some idea but not critical). What is more important is to figure out what the stock is going to do(predict the future). This is suppose to have to do with how well a company does or other factors... it doesn't' always, sometimes it's just purely manipulated and you will be burned by corrupt billionaires. Some companies are purely used to manipulate stock and take peoples money. Bots can be used to drive and up a price to make it different than what it technically should be to give a certain impression. It's all a game, a very flawed game.

Basically you can't predict from the stock price and volume much of anything. In one moment volume could be high and the next it could be nothing(usually there is a little bit of continuity).  You can get a feel for certain events like rallies and dips and all that to some degree but no matter how good you are at predicting you will always fail too. If you have fundamental understanding of why something is taking place then you have context and can make a better estimate of what might happen next. E.g., if an IPO just started you know that hype is going to drive the price higher and then the institutional investors will sell to profit. Pretty much every IPO works this way. It's a way to fleece people that don't understand. Of course if the corp actually wants to do it's think it can work to reward those investors by making profit. A lot of times though it's just a scam where the IPO was specifically created to take money then fail(just another pump and dump).

I don't know what all the spikes are, but clearly they are not legitimate if someone is offering to sell or buy a huge number of shares and it immediately is traded with no change. I would imagine almost all of them are computers doing the trading with other accounts to shift around stock. E.g., they know they can make a trade at time X, they box it just right, and have their other account buy it at time X+0.000000000001. (possibly they do this internally so there is no risk). It's reported that a huge trade went through, and it did, but it was just ""book keeping"". Maybe on their side they have a ""macro"" that makes it all happen but on our side we see the spike and it looks spurious. It could be, in some cases, a glitch such as one wanting to sell 10 share but the 0 gets stuck and one sells 100000000000 shares and the order is immediately canceled by someone upstream.",EternalDissonance,2,/r/stocks/comments/mayajr/large_volume_zero_price_movement/grvfrjy/,0.041,0.858,0.101,0.9962

The takeaway was that dividends shouldn’t be so critical in picking “winning stocks” but is still important to returns. I don’t disagree with his summation at all. I wouldnt only pick a stock simply because it pays me a high yield (per T) but if we assume capital appreciation is also why we’re investing, it’s not that dividends cant be pursued if your DD validates your choosing of a stock.

230,DCF," One way is to use a discounted cash flow valuation to find out the intrinsic value of a stock. This is what I do.

If the share price rises above the intrinsic value per share that you get then it makes sense to sell. Now this only makes sense to do a DCF if you fully understand the company otherwise it can give you confidence in the wrong numbers.

If it's hugely below then it makes sense to buy (margin of safety).

I like Prof. Aswath Damodaran's spreadsheets the best for this. You can use his spreadsheet here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9GfXJ-IrSA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9GfXJ-IrSA)

232,IMO," >I was considering the following investment strategy until I feel educated enough to make smart investments:

>25-40% SPY

>25-40% VOO

SPY and VOO are exactly the same thing, both ETFs tracking the S&P 500. SPY is managed by State Street and VOO is managed by Vanguard. there's no reason to have both, so pick one based on whichever has the lower fee or is available through your brokerage. 

otherwise, you're on the right track IMO. I would not classify Wells Fargo as high-risk, the others probably are relatively high-risk, but if you didn't know anything about Wells Fargo that's a form of risk. 

as you know from reading the book, Lynch is the exact opposite of a FOMO investor. he had a preference for boring or unglamorous companies, something that seems superficially dull or even mildly disgusting but is actually a low-debt, well-managed, money-printing machine. not sure which of his two books it's in, but he talks about how Crown Holdings was one of his best stock picks ... they make bottle caps and cork stoppers. Not exciting. Everyone was chasing high-tech in the 1980s, just as now, but he made a killing with Dunkin' Donuts, Taco Bell and various regional bank stocks. Boring is good. Most people don't want to invest in boring, they're chasing trends and over-paying for the privilege.",harrison_wintergreen,7,/r/stocks/comments/mayizi/i_think_im_experiencing_fomo_can_i_get_your_guys/grv6i2w/,0.159,0.782,0.059,-0.9694

Your goal is to have a modest growth strategy until you've completed your education and feel more confident in your ability to pick individual stocks.   

Since SPY and VOO both track the S&P500, there is no reason to own both of them.  Either EFT is fine.

328,DCF," Here’s a quick cursory overview of the basics to intermediate: 

Most important thing to learn from the start is that the foundation of Investing is not profits, it’s Risk Management. 

You need to learn to be able to keep it, before you can grow it. 

Also, assess your investment objectives (are you seeking safety, income, growth) or secondary objectives like (tax minimization or liquidity)?

Then pick your investment style: Value, Growth, combination of value and growth known as (GARP - Growth at a reasonable price), income or Momentum investing. 

Are you interested being a Passive investor (replicating the performance of an index) or Active investor (trying to outperform the market). 

Also understand different types of investments strategies: Dollar cost averaging, Dividends reinvestment plans, scaling in and scaling out, pyramiding etc.

With regards to psychology: learn about what’s known as “second-order thinking” and build a habit of thinking in probabilities. 

Remember 2 things: that inactivity in a stocks price is not a negative factor and the market rewards patience. 

Macro-economic factors: Ask yourself how the Political, Economical, and Social factors you learn and see will affect the Market, the economy, and more importantly, your investments. 

Learn about DCF models, they are excel models that calculate the intrinsic value of a stock in order to quickly asses wether they are overvalued, undervalued or fair valued by calculating the present value of a share price today relative to the amount of returns that it can potentially generate in the future. 

Fundamental and Technical analysis are not mutually exclusive as most think, you can apply them in unison to be a more effective investor or trader by using fundamentals to value stocks and using technical analysis to assess your entry and exit (buying and selling points). 

Learn about financial ratios to asses the overall financial health of the company (ex. Working Capital, Debt to equity, Gross profit margin, net profit margin, dividend yield, inventory turnover, EPS, P/E ratio. Etc.) - more useful for comparing companies position in the overall industry or sector. 

Diversification (Not putting all your eggs in one basket) by diversifying into different asset classes (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETF’s) or into different sectors and industries etc. and learn about negative asset correlation. 

Lastly, learn the inter-related relationship of how interest rates, inflation, stocks, bond-prices, currencies and commodities interact with each other and influence the overall state of the market, the economy and your investments. 

Depending on how much hours you generally put in a day on learning and research.. 

understanding and applying these concepts above should save you days if not weeks or even months of research and education. But never stop learning and you’ll become an even better investor/trader with experience. 

Hope this helps! :)

338,DD," There is absolutely no doubt that autonomous freight trucks is a big deal, and the question is which company/ies to invest in.  Have you done a full DD on TuSimple yet?  I would be very careful to see how they stand relative to competition.  The competition includes Tesla and these other companies (which I found in a [July 2020 Gearbrain article](https://www.gearbrain.com/autonomous-truck-startup-companies-2587305809.html)), and probably more:

* Embark.
* Daimler.
* Einride.
* Waymo.
* Volvo.
* Ike.

In my uneducated opinion, autonomous trucking is *definitely* something worth investing in.  It's just a matter of finding the right stocks to buy into.

I would also be interested in any ideas about related companies (i.e. not the trucks themselves) that will be affected by the inevitable transition to autonomous trucks.",snowmanuel,3,/r/stocks/comments/mb5b0c/tusimple_the_autonomous_truck_maker/grwve6a/,0.057,0.881,0.063,-0.0717
339,UPS," Good morning. I believe in the tech, as well.  You make very good points on the competition, so here's my 2 cents: I've been a truck driver for 10 years now and my older brothers before me. At first, I laughed at the thought. Then came Tesla, and my mind opened. First, let me say that TuSimple has been the most successful so far and AF is all that they do. They've got trucks going to UPS, Budweiser, Amazon, US Express, etc. 
Daimler is Frieghtliner and they're so big, if they fail, it won't really matter. Their stock is up there already. Something went wrong with Waymo last year, I can't remember what, but I recall it was bad. Tesla was concentrating on electrification of trucks first, but are having problems with battery costs for trucks and have delayed production. Their stock is also pretty expensive.  Volvo is in the same area as Daimler,  Ike I haven't heard of yet and Embark is just getting to us news-wise. (Sorry about lack of spacing in this,  I'm on my mobile this morning). 
TuSimple looks like their launch is going to be this ninth or next, and priced low.
Anyway, as I said before, I'm a truck driver 10 years, investor for only 2. I definately think they have huge potential and wanted input from those more experienced in investing. I'm going to put my 400 bucks house money in it, to be honest. May sell some other stuff, in order to invest more, depending on input Iexa receive.  I thank you very, very much for yours.

Every sale has a buyer and by your own admission you have less experience than the person on the other side of the trade. That gives you really high odds of loosing your 5k. If you are really serious, you should start out by paper trading and make sure you know what you are doing before you put any money up. Unless you don’t mind loosing every single bit of your 5k. If you really don’t mind to lose it, go ahead. But this isn’t December or January anymore. You probably aren’t gonna 10x your investment by buying what everyone else is. Most people blow up their account (lose ALL their money) multiple times before they see anything resembling success. You asked for friendly advice, this is about as friendly as it gets.

I like many others, are in the same boat as you. I've personally lost 33% since I began in late January. 

I didn't fall too hard into GME, but as a Reddit lurker, it is what got me interested (through RH, no less). I've since move to M1 and have been enjoying that, so I'd say you're on the right track going with Fidelity. 

The thing I've been told and is important to remember is why you started investing in the first place. If it was to make money off the GME craze, then I guess we're all finding out it's not that easy. Plus there's plenty of other, more straight-forward ways of gambling money away. I myself live in Michigan and simply CANNOT. GET. ENOUGH. of the MGM/Draftkings/Fanduel ads. 

Likewise, whether or not you want to keep your current postions may be a matter of why you entered them to begin with. If it was a gamble, maybe it's time to chalk it up as ""Market Tuition"". 

But if you entereded the market and your positions bc you wanted to invest long term, then try as hard as you can to not sweat the red. View this as an opportunity to establish a healthy amount in your account before the market begins to grow organically. Over enough time, this has always been the case. 

In my head, as an eternal pessimist, I know that had I entered the market and it immediately went up, I'd be bummed that I wasn't able to put more in, and missed the train, so-to speak. I'd be afriad that future allocations would have been made ""past the prime"". At least this way, I know I'm building a base and awaiting better days.

So its not just negativity I'm sending your way, I was listening to the audiobook of Technical Analysis for Dummies. There was some information I liked (and it sounded good as I listened to it). But like I stated above, the author was constantly talking about how nothing was inherently reliable, so I was turned off. You may feel different.

432,TA," Technically it's not inverted but an ordinary H&S. People here are programmatically against TA (even though they never studied it) but some technical patterns *do* occur often in the market, even though they need not be reliable.",Ahrideva,1,/r/stocks/comments/mbiaaf/tesla_could_be_forming_an_inverted_head_shoulders/gryrehw/,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
433,MA," That's partly why they do work.

Certain patterns have been shown to correlate with certain price moves.  No pattern is a guarantee.  But some patterns are more likely to lead to certain outcomes.

Moving averages are the most widely known and basic element of technical analysis.  The reason why so many investors and traders use them is because so many investors and traders use them.  And that makes them effective tools.  Let's take a simple example: suppose you look at a yearly chart of a particular stock and you notice that 3 times over the past year the stock has pulled back to the 50 day MA and then bounced off and resumed its uptrend. Now the stock is in a short term downtrend and is approaching the 50 DMA.  A lot of people out there in the world notice the same thing you did and will be watching, planning to enter a buy order around the 50 DMA.  The 50 DMA then becomes a demand level for the stock, increasing the likelihood that the stock will bounce off again and continue upwards.",SirGasleak,3,/r/stocks/comments/mbiaaf/tesla_could_be_forming_an_inverted_head_shoulders/gryee4c/,0.02,0.917,0.063,0.7717
434,TA," I didn't ask for your opinion though and I don't care.

My remark was addressed to the OP, who did seem to care about TA to some extent, for reasons that shall remain forever mysterious to more knowledgeable people such as you -- who for some reason feel the need to shout their intellectual superiority at everyone who may think differently.",Ahrideva,1,/r/stocks/comments/mbiaaf/tesla_could_be_forming_an_inverted_head_shoulders/grz1qnf/,0.08,0.834,0.086,0.1139
