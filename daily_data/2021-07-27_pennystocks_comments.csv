0,SPRT," This is great and I do think there's still growth left in the price action, but I recommend buying shares for SPRT instead of calls for those who are wary of squeeze DDs.
The upcoming Bitcoin merger news when announced will be a huge catalyst for SPRT, so if you buy in here and a true squeeze doesn't happen you aren't stuck bagholding for long.

You can never time the top of a squeeze, but you can play it safe with shares or scalp with options. Remember to scale out positions on the way up and squeeze plays will be a lot more profitable for you in the long run.",938961,8,/r/pennystocks/comments/osik93/happy_new_data_day_to_you_to_update_july_26/h6p94dm/,0.015,0.708,0.278,0.9859

Good news doesn't make companies run up. That's a misconception. DESIRED news is what makes companies run up. It's just that often the 2 go hand in hand. Desired news often immediately signals this company is about to level up or some crap is about to go down which triggers the buying frenzy. But people aren't patient and if the news in their eyes just kicks the can down the road, they'll pack up their bags and leave. 

A good example is what happened to CTXR. The news was technically positive as the Phase 3 was going well. But unbeknownst to me at the time, the reason for the big run up was that folks didn't just want a smooth going Phase 3. They wanted Mino Lok's testing to get straight up halted and fast tracked and when that didn't happen it tanked by half.
