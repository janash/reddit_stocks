15,GM," >All too accurate. Everybody is ramping fast 

Funny, people have been saying that for a decade now, and we have Toyota with no electric cars and trying to push back the transition to EVs, VW with cars riddled with software issues, Chevrolet with self-combusting cars, GM with a huge investment in vaporware (Nikola) and a battery system that looks impressive but we don't actually know how well it will perform, and while Ford has some good EVs, they don't have many nor do they plan to produce a ton.

>Tesla doesn’t have a working design group that can spin model refreshes at the rate other brands can

I'd rather have a good EV with the same design for a decade, than shitty EVs that can't even run right. 

>That’s part of the reason the semi is delayed - PACCAR and Daimler already have their semis in production.

This is fair, but I think also another huge reason the semi production is delayed is Tesla just doesn't have enough batteries. With battery production in Giga Berlin and Giga Texas when they're done, that might change, but maybe the 4680 isn't quite finalized yet, who knows.

>It’s kind of amazing that they made it through S3XY, now time will tell if they can do a major model refresh - customers will only let you make the same body for so long.

Given Tesla literally cannot produce enough vehicles to meet demand, and consistently tops the charts in pretty much every country, I don't think that's a problem, not for a long while yet.

Meanwhile, none of the other car manufacturers can produce cars that approach either the quality or the quantity of model 3's and model Y's being produced. 

OEMs better hope Tesla doesn't come out with a 30k EV anytime soon.",BCRE8TVE,84,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/osc8je/tesla_vs_everyone_else/h6o3hmv/,0.04,0.818,0.142,0.9874
16,ICE," > 2024 really will be the year that tests how much of the market Tesla can hold on to.

That's fair. I'm looking forward to seeing how it all ends up, I certainly don't know for sure but I'm pretty confident in Telsa and will keep diamondhanding my shares.

That being said Tesla has what, 2 factories operating ATM, one in Shanghai and one in Fremont? With Giga Berlin and Giga Texas, they're going to what, double-triple their manufacturing capacity? 

>Yes Tesla is battery limited and it makes no financial sense to dump all of them into trucks that will eat up all their margin to try to fight in a market that is extreme hard to compete in.

I also know very little about how hard it is to compete in the BEV semi market, it seems to me it's a growing market that still has lots of room to grow for industries around the world to replace their ICE fleets of short to medium range semis. Then again I'm kinda talking out of my ass because I really have no idea, it's just an educated guess on my part.

>Tesla blazed the path and now the rest of the industry can walk on in with a fraction of the capital investment with enormous established customer bases.

Tesla blazed the path, but most other OEMs still have a lot of issues with their software and batteries. The path Tesla has blazed, has been to the benefit of Tesla, and they're not sharing how they did it. All the other companies know it can be done, they just have to figure out a way to do it. So far it's been rather disappointing with lots of promises and few high-quality products delivered.

Tesla blazed the trail, they know how to make cars, and now they're going to produce massively more. The other OEMs know how to make ICE cars, they're still struggling to catch up to Tesla, and Tesla is going to keep blazing ahead with giga-casting, 4680 (when they're ready), [getting their own lithium supply from Nevada clay,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mej1erLgCIs) and more.

Scaling up isn'T easy, the model 3 production hell showed that, but Tesla has better products and is in a better position to scale up EV production than pretty much all the competitors. 

I hope we get lots of great BEV options from many different manufacturers, but I don't see Tesla getting dethroned anytime soon.",BCRE8TVE,19,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/osc8je/tesla_vs_everyone_else/h6o68gq/,0.098,0.801,0.101,0.5502
17,IBM," I am from Germany and my work and a lot of others in my area is heavily dependent on German car manufacturers. So I know a little how things work here.

  


That being said, with all positive spin, let's not forget that VW was close to fire their CEO because he pushed hard on electro.

The story here is as old as IBM, Kodak and ""insert any old industry"" here. The thinking you are to big to fail, have to many assets and too much ""true"" knowledge of how things work is the problem.

We are talking about a industry that has dealers that are required to sell certain numbers, have a certain look to get some benefit. Now where most of the local dealers make big money is services. That's where there is a lot of jobs and does make the bread and butter daily money. Most of it, if not all will go away! Do you think the big manufacturers, that have divisions within, struggling to hold on to power care changing much of the structure for the local guys? 

The beauty of electric is a fundamental shift from lots of little things that are going to break to very few things that end up being simply replaced.

Now as ""fast"" as you think this shift is going to happen... with structures and jobs that become insignificant or obsolete in a well entrenched industry, it will be way to slow. Stifled bypeople that don't know or want to know better.

Most of these German brands will exist in name only and it is not going to be Tesla but some Chinese companies that have been hiring German brains for the last 10+ years from German companies because they don't see the light.

  


And aside from all of that... People make the huge mistake to think of Tesla as a car company. Which is just part of their business. So far I have seen nothing, absolutely nothing, that would indicate a steady decline on Tesla over the competition.

Yeah not gonna deny they've been fucky a bit to try and qualify for incentives for sure. Per 30k car I'm pretty sure it's going to be iron phosphate for cheaper batteries and lower range, rather than nickel-based.

>Hyundai has a better chance, they have a legit EV in the kona EV that’s sold for less than the handicapped TM3. And GM’s incentives on bolts have brought it closer to 30k.

The Kona is definitely a strong contender, let's hope they solve their battery issues so they don't have to do recalls. Per the bolts, it's definitely a good budget EV, but their batteries catch fire, so they need to figure out batteries even more urgently than Hyundai.

The Ford F-150 EV isn't on the market yet (I think) but good on them for getting the first EV pickup out there, and I hope it'll be a great vehicle. The Mach E, along with the Porshe Taycan, are to great EV cars as well.

No, VW hasn't surpassed Tesla with the ID3 yet. They're certainly coming closer, but they haven't yet. If things keep going as they are, maybe they will, but this is also while Tesla is production constrained. Giga Berlin should be operational before the end of this year, or early next year, and that's going to solve Tesla's production limits.

>Their larger ID4 for US market should do similar once their US production is going next year. This year is mainly German made (higher cost) and going to be smaller quantity while they sort out software.

I certainly hope they solve their software issues, the ID4 doesn't look bad at all. It's a shame some ID3s and ID4s can't recharge when you plug them in, and that the software can't be updated unless you bring the cars to the dealerships. 

More EVs and more competition is good, it helps everyone get an EV and get them away from ICE vehicles. I just don't see Tesla getting dethroned for at least say a decade, unless something seriously wrong happens at or with Tesla.

Lucid on the other hand is like Jaguar/Lambo.  Nobody needs these cars.  Just for flexing, just for show.  

Rivian is at least useful.  They're signed to become maker of Amazon's new delivery vans.  These are custom designed to maximize space for packages.  Take out the engine, put the driver where the engine was, put some cargo room where the driver used to be, etc. 

So in this sense, Rivian and Tesla are not direct competitors.  Why buy a Lucid air when you could get a Plaid S+?

H2 made from sustainable clean energy (nuke, hydro, solar, wind), is just electric battery with less efficiency, more cost, and roughly the same energy density delivered to the wheels. Why bother?

Porsche will sell about 10,000 Taycans this year. 

Mercedes sells about 60,000 S-Class sedans per year and will start selling their own luxury EV, the EQS.

Tesla usually sells less than 60,000 Model S sedans and will sell less this year due to downtime refreshing the model. For comparison, they’ll probably sell ~800,000 Model 3/Y this year.

Even if every potential S-Class buyer switches to electric starting now, Lucid would have to take a third of that pie to reach their goal of 20,000 units next year.

159,AI," Except TSLA has a 15 year head start and they were doing this when nobody else was which made the competition extremely small. 

Now not only is TSLA so far beyond Lucid in terms of having a head start but so is every single major manufacturer in the world.

15 years ago TSLA had no competition. If you wanted a nice EV you had to pick a Tesla. Now literally every single manufacturer has a nice EV model not to mention the amount of newcomer competition. Even if Lucid was literally the only newcomer on the block I just dont see how they can make it in such an oversaturated market and they'll completely get demolished in terms of how far ahead TSLA is in terms of AI and the pure data they have.


Not a TSLA fanboy, but ffs comparing this to TSLA 15 years ago is a complete fucking joke and pure WSB copium. Again, even if they were literally the only new kid on the block i still dont see them making it long term with amazing valuations, now we have NIO, LI, XPeng, Fisker ect... (not that those are any good) but the whole ""I want a car that isnt from an established brand"" demographic is already extremely fucking low, the people who want a Lucid car and wont settle on anything less is pretty much nonexistent and I dont see that becoming a big demographic anytime soon with just how similar/inferior it is to other models on top of the fact that they don't have decades of history to back them up.


6 new EV companies during a time when literally every single major manufacturer is pumping out and perfecting their own version. Lucid has no advantage in this space other than the look of their car and it's really not even that special, and is it worth buying a car from a company where not a single person can tell you about the cars longetivity or reliability? 

People gave Tesla a shot at the time because it was extremely unique combined with being backed by Musk. Lucid will sell a few cars but can they survive for 100 years after coming in this late into the game and bringing absolutely nothing revolutionary to the table?

He also told me when Jack Ma dissapeared that he will come back because a similar case happened, when he was in China, to a public person that was too 'loud'. He was right about that.

He said you can build a scam in China and get away with it because there is no repercussions from the Chinese government. Also USA doesn't follow you in China.

219,FOUR," ""You are so out of touch making that comment I can tell you never advanced a socioeconomic class""

""At one point when I was younger my family lived in a trailer park.""

At one point when I was younger, my family lived in a three-bedroom apartment. A family of 9, my older brother slept in a closet.

2015-2016 I was working full-time for $11/hr and taking online college courses full-time in the evening. Graduated in early 2017 with a degree in Software Engineering - $25k in student loans. Paid it off in two years. In four years I went from $11/hr to making six figures (currently at 135k/yr or $70/hr). Work for an employer with health benefits that covered FOUR surgeries for my spouse.

We are currently debt-free and sitting on some cash for a down payment on a house (just waiting for the market to cool down).

So my original comment stands - I didn't get a worthless degree, I made good financial decisions, and made sure I had great health insurance to take care of my wife. Didn't go broke when she got sick, and not drowning in debt from college/student loans.

Eastern District of New York  
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Defendant Forfeited His Interest in the Album, “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin,” Following Conviction for Engaging in Securities Fraud Schemes

Proceeds from the Sale Will be Applied to Forfeiture Money Judgment Against Shkreli

Earlier today, the United States sold the sole copy of the Wu-Tang Clan album “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin” (the “Album”) **which had previously been ordered to be forfeited as a substitute asset in connection with the approximately $7.4 million forfeiture money judgment** (Forfeiture Money Judgment) entered against Shkreli at his March 2018 sentencing.  Proceeds from the sale of the Album will be applied to satisfy the outstanding balance owed on the Forfeiture Money Judgment.  The contract of sale contains a confidentiality provision that protects information relating to the buyer and price.

Jacquelyn M. Kasulis, Acting United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, announced the sale of the Album.

“Through the diligent and persistent efforts of this Office and its law enforcement partners, Shkreli has been held accountable and paid the price for lying and stealing from investors to enrich himself.  **With today’s sale of this one-of-a-kind album,** **his payment of the forfeiture is now complete**,” stated Acting U.S. Attorney Kasulis.  Ms. Kasulis acknowledged the significant efforts of the U.S. Marshals Service and, in particular, the work of the U.S. Marshals Service’s Office of General Counsel and the Complex Asset Unit of the agency’s Asset Forfeiture Division, as well as assistance provided by the Department of Justice’s Civil Division, Commercial Litigation Branch.

Shkreli **was** the founder and managing member of hedge funds MSMB Capital Management LP and MSMB Healthcare Management LP and the former Chief Executive Officer of Retrophin Inc. (“Retrophin”), a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company.  Following a six-week trial in federal court in Brooklyn, Shkreli was convicted in August 2017 of two counts of securities fraud and one count of securities fraud conspiracy for orchestrating a series of schemes to defraud investors in the hedge funds and to manipulate the price and trading volume of Retrophin’s stock.  United States District Judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto sentenced Shkreli to seven years’ imprisonment, to be followed by three years’ supervised release, and ordered him to pay the Forfeiture Money Judgment, approximately $388,000 in restitution and a $75,000 fine.  **Judge Matsumoto also ordered Shkreli to forfeit the Album and other substitute assets to satisfy the Forfeiture Judgment.**

Shkreli’s conviction and sentence, including the imposition of the Forfeiture Money Judgment, were affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in July 2019.  **Following the U.S. Supreme Court’s denial of Shkreli’s request for further review of his conviction and sentence**, **the government seized the Album and other assets owed by Shkreli.**

At the time Shkreli purchased the Album in 2015, it was marketed as “both a work of art and an audio artifact.”  The Album includes a hand-carved nickel-silver box as well as a leather-bound manuscript containing lyrics and a certificate of authenticity.  The Album is subject to various restrictions, including those relating to the duplication of its sound recordings. In September 2017, **just weeks after his conviction but before the district court-imposed forfeiture, Shkreli attempted to sell the Album through an on-line auction**.

Forfeiture matters related to Shkreli’s sentence were handled by Assistant United States Attorneys Laura D. Mantell and Claire S. Kedeshian of the newly formed Asset Recovery Section in the Office’s Criminal Division.  Acting U.S. Attorney Kasulis and Assistant United States Attorneys Alixandra E. Smith and G. Karthik Srinivasan (now an Assistant United States Attorney in the Western District of Texas) were in charge of the prosecution of Shkreli, and defended his conviction and sentence on appeal.",Mjbishop327,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ossxhs/united_states_sells_unique_wutang_clan_album/h6qnmhd/,0.042,0.867,0.091,0.961

In other words, the stock is free-falling due to rumors (not concrete actions) towards regulating (not banning) for-profit education businesses (an industry that has literally nothing to do with BABA).

341,AAPL," Is the BABA price drop an overreaction? Only time will tell ig, but think about it this way. Let’s say the US government announces their intent to regulate for-profit healthcare industries, with the ultimate goal of turning them into non-profits. 

If this happened, you would certainly expect to see steep drops in healthcare stocks. What you would not expect, is for companies like AAPL to start dropping by 5% each day.

I don't think Uber drivers' jobs suck because of the driving part. I think it sucks mostly because you have to deal with idiots who don't respect you or your car.

Now imagine 5 of them for each suit (Treyarch, Infinityward, High moon studios, Toys for Bob, Activision Publishing), and the fattest women (Activision Publishing) with their own, yet smaller fat women that represent independent subsidiaries.

3. I've learned alot about stonks since the GameStop saga, I assume most you all have to. Essentially, the stock market is fraudulent and AMC and GME are the only real plays.

Then Citadel LLC abusives market maker privileges with its hedgefund arm and naked shorts all the companies it wants. Directly violated Reg SHO 203b with pitful fines.

We are also liable for premiums, borrow fees, etc. Huge amounts of Gamers between this sub, r/wow, and other subs would have to join in and all short activision stock together.

Then Citadel LLC abusives market maker privileges with its hedgefund arm and naked shorts all the companies it wants. Directly violated Reg SHO 203b with pitful fines. No intention to cover phantom shares and FTD's as much as they want.

4.  If retail decides to short a stock, we need legitimate shares to borrow. Hedgefunds and abusive MM don't. We are also liable for premiums, borrow fees, etc. Huge amounts of Gamers between this sub, r/wow, and other subs would have to join in and all short activision stock together. I might change my mind if I see a bunch of 'tards short sell Activision here, and convince former WOW players to join us.

803,BABA," I have one 2023 call on it but I gotta say…people have never been more spooked about Chinese investing. It’s half of what people are talking about on Bloomberg these days. Xi Jinping’s recent crackdown is pretty alarming — and it’s been vast. 

The most alarming thing is that there’s chatter of him making a move on VIEs and curtailing capital outflows. While I don’t think it’ll be so severe as disallowing them, any change to the investing structure could cause a massive panic and outflows.

Also tons of noise about data sharing policy, American firms blacklisting Chinese firms (even those in Hong Kong) to protect user data, etc. Xi doesn’t really care about the equity markets as much as he cares about absolute control. 

Finally, the Evergrande debt roll off could get dicey and cause contagion. Look into it — this isn’t an immaterial risk and only equity research analysts are paying attention to it. 

Retail has been blind to most of these issues. Hence the smart money selloff. And I’m not convinced this is a “blip”. It’s all contributed to a structural shift in the investing landscape in China.

851,RIDE," The ""funding deal"" is a fancy way of saying public equity offering at a 3% discount.

I read the SEC filing with this funding deal and it is nothing special.

Here are the key points of the deal.

1. RIDE can sell up to 1/3 of the prior day volume or $30M to YA.
2. YA can sell the shares at anytime, including before they buy them
3. YA's cost of these share is 97% of the 3 day average using VWAP on the following three days.
4. In total there are about 35M shares available to be sold under this agreement

So in sum, YA will periodically get a batch of shares from RIDE that they can sell for a 3% profit with minimal risk.

At the current price of $7.4 per share, at most RIDE can receive about $250M under this offering.

This is not opinion what I am saying, but fact. In short this is not some magic funding deal, this is simply share dilution trying to raise money on the stock market. If this is how you need to raise funds, and we are talking at current market prices about $250M, not $400M how much confidence should this inspire that others want to give them money?",aka0007,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/osa3to/the_hated_ride_but_hear_me_out/h6o685a/,0.014,0.867,0.119,0.9633

856,RIDE," It is 35M shares at a 3% discount based on 3 day VWAP following, so minimal risk. YA simply will take the shares and unload them over the next few days. They are very unlikely to maintain a position and have exposure to RIDE.

If you do the math at current share prices at most RIDE can raise about $250M. This assumes the price does not tank as these shares get unloaded (YA has zero incentive to hold, rather they would want to sell in the  three days to try to mimic the VWAP average and make their 3%). Also, it is capped at $30M per day or 1/3 of prior day volume (YA would not want too many shares at once  which can destabilize the price too much as they unload and have them risk selling below the 3 day VWAP average).

Wish people would be honest about how they present numbers. This stuff is all on paper in the SEC filing.
