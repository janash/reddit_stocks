32,III," The Mino-Lok is an antibiotic and a mineral/metal chelator.

It's used to flush and clean catheters that can otherwise become infected and can be very costly and harmful to remove.

44,UTI," Be careful, it might not be the total slam dunk it is being painted as, or it probably would've already taken off:


https://parade.com/1084176/leighweingus/what-is-phexxi/


“With ideal use, where there is adherence to the recommended time frame for administering Phexxi, efficacy can be as high as 93%,” says Sekhon. “It can be used concomitantly with a diaphragm, condoms, or other barrier methods, to maximize efficacy of contraception.”

""Like most medications, Phexxi does have side effects—and some of them are unpleasant, to say the least. “The most common side effects reported in clinical trials were vaginal burning and itching,” Sekhon says. “Less commonly, users might experience a urinary tract infection, or UTI. Male partners may also notice local discomfort (burning, itching), most of which are mild.” It’s also worth nothing that the vaginal burning and itching is a pretty common side effect: Nearly one in five women experienced it, according to van Dis, as compared to one in 10 men who experienced it.""


93% effective if used perfectly, and causes burning and itching in 20% of women and in 10% of men. Like, if used PERFECTLY, there is still an almost 1 in 10 chance she's going to get pregnant?

It looks plain basic just like most chinese websites but i DONT see the US address that op is mentioning. The investor tab has financials of the old company, SEC filings and a bunch on 6-K i think.

So they are trying to be transparent with the company details. Far better than other companies.

104,HEPA," We need to have a conversation about the state of this subreddit.

It is quickly becoming the new /wsb and I think is suffering immensely for it. There are more memes and more posts about stocks that not only are not on RH, they're not even below $5.

I also believe that we're getting pumped more than ever by bots and/or farmed accounts, and we need to be extra vigilant **in our own DD.** *Being vigilant does not mean baselessly accusing newer accounts of being bots.* If you don't do DD, you have no one to blame but yourself for buying at the top of a pump. I've done it, you've done it. Nobody wants to do it twice.

Most of us are here to get into the next big stock early. Some are not sure if they're trading or investing, so they're trying to do a bit of both. I think people need to understand that most of the tickers being shared are not new, have probably already been pumped, and don't have much hope of going higher without major news. HEPA, ZOM, CTRM, come to mind. A lot of these stocks are years old.

Their revenue has been down recently due to COVID, but there is potential for treating other cancers that sounds promising. I loaded up on some more shares this morning.

I also think that GTE will take off at some point. The price of Brent crude keeps soaring above their recent ""high"" projection, I don't see how the stock price doesn't catch up eventually.

They used to be called [ContraVir](http://ir.contravir.com/news-releases/news-release-details/contravir-pharmaceuticals-announces-name-change-hepion). Have never brought a drug to market. 

With this new drug, it’s so early and lots of things can go wrong in clinical trials. Most drugs don’t have successful phase 2, even fewer drugs go on to have successful phase 3.

If everything goes as they project it to, NDA isn’t expected until 2025 or 2026 per their own estimate. So that’s 4 to 5 years of clinical trials until they even file for FDA approval. There also aren’t any other drugs in the pipeline as far as I can tell.

453,DD," “Once the IND is submitted, the sponsor must wait 30 calendar days before initiating any clinical trials.  During this time, FDA has an opportunity to review the IND for safety to assure that research subjects will not be subjected to unreasonable risk.” -FDA.GOV

Tell me if I am wrong, but, the way that reads to me is that they are able to begin clinical trials as of 30 days after the IND is submitted unless the FDA finds reason to stop them from doing so.

So from what I am seeing they submitted the IND for their Covid treatment on the 21st of January. My math says that’s 28 days. But, who knows I am standing on a ladder working construction and looking into this at the same time. 

Zimhi is another drug that they are looking for FDA approval on that looks like it should be getting close. The more I read into this I am even more confused that more people aren’t jumping on the low price with a lot of potential. Outside of not yet having FDA approval yet, what is holding people back. Again I am new to this and learning. This is the most DD I have ever done on my own. So if nothing else I have learned a bit about doing that.

467,DD," So I've only been trading a few weeks now but can offer some advice on what I've done recently to turn things around. Here are some things I look for when I want to invest on a stock and do some DD:

1) **Catalysts:** Is there a reason the stock will go up in the near future? Are there any catalysts on the horizon or news on what they are doing? I'm a pharmacist by trade and like to look into the biopharmaceuticals sector. So I do some research into drugs in the pipeline and results of trials. There are typically 3 phases of drug research and development and I try to see if there is anything promising in phase 3 trials after looking at their earlier trials data.

2) **Volume:** I look into the trade volume, I've learned that stocks seem to go up and down with trade volume and interest. If a stock is over the average volume I'm more keen to buy into it than one that is below average volume.

3) **Price Targets:** Looking into CNN, Yahoo and Barcharts for estimated price points and analyst information. If the stock is below the ""Low"" price target and has potential of booming more than 300% in the future at the ""high"" price target, I'll look into it more. Analyst ratings can also reassure me if they're positioned all into the ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" rating. 

4) **Insider buys:** If the owners of a security are pumping their own money into buying more shares it's a good indication they think they'll make some money out of it. Openinsider is a great website to see the latest SEC filings and even breaks it into penny stock filings too.

5) **When to sell?:** I've learned quickly that sometimes taking a 20-30% profit and selling a stock I was holding is much better than getting burned on it and becoming a ""bag holder""

This is all just what I've learned in the last few weeks that has turned my trading around recently. Throwing money at meme stocks without doing DD burned me but helped me to learn how to do things more thoroughly.
