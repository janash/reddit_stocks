2.) They have rock solid finances.

3.) They are acting more and more as a marketplace than an actual vendor. Why build your own website or rent commercial real estate when you can setup in a factory and sell your shit through Amazon?

4.) As the world gets more digital they will become more prominent.

5.) Their only real competition comes from Chinese and Indian companies who are essentially doing the same thing, and neither are likely to gain traction in the USA due to Amazon's already prolific infrastructure.

6.) They have a P/E of 48.96. This is high by value investing standards, but it's much lower than other hot companies. TSLA has a P/E around 1400-1500 at the moment. If AMZN had a PE of 1500 it would have a price of like $100,000 a share. This was calculated using the Dr. Parik Patel methodology.

7.) Almost nobody is shorting them (0.77% float). Hedge funds, retail investors, boomers, etc are happy to buy and hold right now even though the price is well north of $3000 / share.

2.) They have rock solid finances.

3.) They are acting more and more as a marketplace than an actual vendor. Why build your own website or rent commercial real estate when you can setup in a factory and sell your shit through Amazon?

4.) As the world gets more digital they will become more prominent.

5.) Their only real competition comes from Chinese and Indian companies who are essentially doing the same thing, and neither are likely to gain traction in the USA due to Amazon's already prolific infrastructure.

6.) They have a P/E of 48.96. This is high by value investing standards, but it's much lower than other hot companies. TSLA has a P/E around 1400-1500 at the moment. If AMZN had a PE of 1500 it would have a price of like $100,000 a share. This was calculated using the Dr. Parik Patel methodology.

7.) Almost nobody is shorting them (0.77% float). Hedge funds, retail investors, boomers, etc are happy to buy and hold right now even though the price is well north of $3000 / share.

8.) Announcing a dividend or a split could be the catalyst to send it to the moon. Just look at TSLA earlier this year.

AWS, launched in 2006, provides services to businesses, government agencies and academic institutions to store information and deliver content. Amazon says AWS provides an ""infrastructure platform in the cloud,"" for a variety of ""solutions"" such as hosting applications and websites, providing enterprise IT, and content delivery. Amazon's AWS segment generated net sales of $45.4 billion and operating income of $13.5 billion in FY 2020. Net sales grew 29.5% while operating income rose 47.1% compared to FY 2019. Although net sales from AWS are below net sales for the North America segment, AWS's operating income is substantially higher. The AWS segment accounts for about 12% of total net sales and 59% of operating income for all segments.

173,DD," So for example take apple. Apple is a great stock. Great company. Makes lots and lots of money. Huge profits. 

But if I offer to sell you a share at 10000 you say no. Yeah it's a good stock. But that doesn't really mean anything. If I offer you a share of apple at 30 you should bite my hand off. 

Value that's the watch word. A lot of the DD posted on Reddit is completely devoid of any discussion of value. That huge new contract a company signs means nothing if that value was already baked into the price. 

Talk to people with huge gains and they'll tell you the dumb shit they made it on. It's better to buy a failing company for 3x less than it's worth than a successful company for 1.5x it's value.

I was invested in GME before the hype, sold for profits, and every share that I have now is on house money. Nonetheless, I fucking put my money where my mouth is...

You on the other hand...are you shorting? Are you buying puts (down to $10?) 

4/16 $20P were only $370 at close today, I hope you bought 10 of those to make good on your thesis that GME is going bankrupt / is going to single digits. 

So unless you are willing to fucking put your money where your mouth is, you don‚Äôt need to express your opinion. 

There is a group of investors who will never sell and will buy up if it ever gets to single digits for any reason. But it won‚Äôt get to single digits, because Ryan Cohen will buy more shares if it ever gets close to $16 (his last purchase price).

I believe Cuban was right in stating that *we* need to learn from the mistakes of this and carry on, hoping we don't make the same ill fated decisions. In other words, if we had been trading on a platform with a decent balance sheet (Fidelity, Vanguard, etc.) and perhaps not gambling with money that wasn't ours, perhaps we'd all be millionaires from this.

I‚Äôm also avoiding jumping on hype trains now - I was late to the weed stock party and managed to overcome the fomo...thank fuck I dodged that bullet!!

If and when GME does go back up, I‚Äôll be able to either celebrate with other holders, or at least have lost a way lesser percentage. There‚Äôs no reason to sell at such a loss, so I‚Äôll continue to hold with the rest of you!

516,EV," I agree and here's my take (GME can also take advantage of exclusive digital content sales):

Cohen [sold](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewy_(company)) chewy for $3.3 billion, when it had $2 billion revenue. This was before infinite money brrr valuations, in 2017. 

GameStop has an EV of about $4.4 billion (not counting receivables, inventory, and factoring debt) with pre-COVID revenue of $8 billion. This is before they became a worldwide symbol of sticking it to the man.

Assuming Cohen can only accomplish at GameStop what he accomplished at chewy and has no new tricks, he can easily get us to a $14-20 billion market cap with $8-10 billion in future revenue. That yeilds a post-turnaround share price of at least $200.

If we go further than this and assume Cohen can permanently increase GameStop's gross margins (digital sales of exclusive content) the sky is the limit. GameStop [already sells](https://www.thegamer.com/video-games-exclusive-gamestop-value-worth/) exclusive games, so this is not a huge stretch.

Amazon Google, Steam, Facebook, and Apple are also trying to become digital game distribution hubs with far greater volume than the console makers/studios. These companies have much larger platforms with several times the loyal users and they gave hoards of cash. They can simply add the same game titles and undercut prices to monopolize the market. 

GameStop suffered competitively and still does. Cohen is here to change that. With console makers and game studios facing the reality of being out-hubbed by much larger hubs, they will listen to proposals by an independent retailer like GameStop to diversify their distribution channels in a way that gives GameStop an edge (exclusive content, etc.).

The fact that GameStop is competitively outmatched right now doesn't determine it's value 5 years from now. Cohen beat Amazon in the pet business and I trust he can do it with GameStop. With all this in our smooth brains and given our shareholder loyalty, think of how long this squeeze will last. This is probably the next Tesla.

Also, they should get liquor licenses, snatch up cheap additional retail space, and allow people to play old games in house for a small fee. A bar near me has been living off this business model for years. Turns out people love to drink and drive, as long as it's in MarioKart. GOG is proof that people will shell out for nostalgia, but there's only so much GOG can do for really old games. That's where GameStop could come in. Hell, they could even let people bring their own games in and play them on whatever systems meet the requirements. And it doesn't have to stop with nostalgia either. How about $1 or $2 to demo a new game before you buy it? Most other gamers I know miss the option of trying out a game before buying it.

They could do all this stuff and also expand to digital, and they could undercut Steam by only taking 20 - 25% of revenue of all games sold on the platform. Valve is not publicly traded, so anyone who wants to buy stock in gaming retailers would be funneled to GME. And then... we die a glorious, horrific death, crushed under the sheer mass of tendies.

591,ARE," The reason why DFV was saying that digital sales are way overblown is for many reasons.

1. Here in America, many people still don't have access to decent internet and video games today are FUCKING HUGE. These people are going to get physical copies.
2. Some people just like holding the physical item. Card games, movies, books. All are digital as well as physical. Physical is NEVER going away (Sony figured out they can charge people 100 dollars extra for the privilege).
3. For over a decade we've been hearing that digital sales will make physical go the way of the dodo. And this still isn't the case. For the PC market, I would say this is MUCH more prevalent. But consoles? Animal Crossing was Nintendo's best selling game of 2020 and just about half of it's sales were physical. In the middle of a pandemic.
4. Even though physical sales ARE slowing down, it's not as fast as people predicted for reasons 1 and 2, and the gaming market continues to expand anyway. So while the physical market is shrinking, the physical sales are relatively the same because of market growth.

It's all of these factors that will guarantee Gamestop doesn't go under in the near future buying them more time for their transition. Plus if utilized correctly their B/M stores can be used to create unique experiences that helps insure customer stickiness. Oh wait! That's what they're doing. Gamestop bears be damned.

2. Some people just like holding the physical item. Card games, movies, books. All are digital as well as physical. Physical is NEVER going away (Sony figured out they can charge people 100 dollars extra for the privilege).
3. For over a decade we've been hearing that digital sales will make physical go the way of the dodo. And this still isn't the case. For the PC market, I would say this is MUCH more prevalent. But consoles? Animal Crossing was Nintendo's best selling game of 2020 and just about half of it's sales were physical. In the middle of a pandemic.
4. Even though physical sales ARE slowing down, it's not as fast as people predicted for reasons 1 and 2, and the gaming market continues to expand anyway. So while the physical market is shrinking, the physical sales are relatively the same because of market growth.

It's all of these factors that will guarantee Gamestop doesn't go under in the near future buying them more time for their transition. Plus if utilized correctly their B/M stores can be used to create unique experiences that helps insure customer stickiness. Oh wait! That's what they're doing. Gamestop bears be damned.

631,GME," And when it reaches $100 it would become the new bottom for you. The reason people always talk about losing money in this sub is because regardless of how high a stock gets, they think it will still go up. So they refuse to sell  because their expectations change because of the graph, not because of any change in fundementals.

Can GME go up? Yes but not with their current fundementals. The company needs to pivot to digital and they need to build the infrastructure for that. They need to have a plan, execute on it, be successful at the execution all while the rest of the industry will wait for them. 

They basically need to act like a new company, succeed at becoming a new company and then start performing like one. It is possible but it will require a lot of hard work and actual results to warrant a 1000% increase on the company's original value to be considered a floor (granted the original stock price was undervalued).

To clarify, I actually expect great things from Cohen for the future of GME. I also think that all the publicity is a good boon for them. But for the evaluation to go higher, things actually need to happen; things which will likely need a lot of set up and will require time to play-out. That's why I am a bit confused when people tell me that GME is still undervalued at its' current price. Personally, I expect price of $20-25 in the coming 6-12 months. Maybe even a bit lower. The publicity might sustain a higher evaluation for a while by itself but I think it will eventually dip weeks or months from now when people remember that it is still the same good old GameStop.

912,GME," The way bubbles work and the reason they are so demoralizing is because it doesn't just crash and then stabilize and we're all good. It plunges, then appears to recover and assuage your panic with a bull trap, then it plunges again. Eventually when you think it's over and has stabilized, might start going up again slowly, etc., but after a while it drops *again.* Maybe not a rapid plunge, could just be a sloooooow decline where there's green days and red days but the red still outnumbers the green. That's the point when most of you buying back in at $50, thinking you have diamond hands, will lose your resolve. It's an emotionally exhausting rollercoaster and there will come a point when it seems like it will never recover, that the bleeding will never stop.

GME is still overvalued at $50 and while no one *knows* what's gonna happen, there is still a lot of room for downside. 1 week is a very short timeframe and let's not forget that GME was less than $15 just two months ago.

936,TLRY," Yeah,  but TLRY revenue has consistently increased while SNDL's revenue is almost half of what it was for Q1 '20. They had a -554% profit margin in Q3. Personally, I feel SNDL's stock is way overvalued and the only reason it's so high, pun intended, is due to the 1B in volume. Once the volume settles I suspect it will drop back down closer to $1.

971,AMD," I FD'd some CRSR calls a few times.  Sometime it works, sometimes it doesn't.  Schizo stock for schizo traders.  3 things worth pointing out that have me now getting on this trade with you

1) as we return to normal, people are going to want to get out more.  That means less time in front of their computers.  I'm placing bets on travel, not more gaming peripherals

2) CRSR isn't a chip play.  They make rgb gear and water-cooling radiators and shit.  Buyden isn't going to help with the chips they consume.  Hell, he thinks the shortage is affecting Ruffles and Utz.  Hopefully sometime in his cabinet realizes that it's supposed to be centered around the auto industry.

3) and this is the big one: they had a blowout year last year because everybody and their dog built a computer last year due to the new gpu's and consumer chips from AMD combined with everyone getting imprisoned for a year.  Which means they needed corsair fans and RAM and psu's.

.... Those people aren't building another computer this year.  It's cyclical, we won't see them again for at least 3 years.  And they'll recycle their fans and power.

Anecdotally, the lines at my local Micro Center were routinely 100 people deep last summer, and are 20% of that now.  And my dd on that was, over the summer it smelled like soap and perfume, but now it smells like nerd again, so the normies are gone.  That's science.

1009,CRSR," CRSR itself indicates a slowing sales growth (projecting 1,75-1,90B revenue for 2021) and in the investor call they said H2 is very uncertain for gaming demand, if lockdowns get lifted.

I think they are conservative in their forward projections (as they were in Q4) and hope to underpromise and overperform.

Current price level looks to bounce between support and resistance. 

I think shorts may have gambled on the fact that share lock-up will end soon and there will be some cashing out. After all, the price is already 3x IPO price. On the other hand there already was an opportunity to cash out in January.

1017,AMD," CRSR doesn't really sell anything with high end chips. Even state of the art DRAM (one of their most technically advanced product lines), is using older processes, 15nm and up. Admittedly not as old as the ICs in other product lines, but still not high end. And even though they don't break it down on thr earnings call, I'd be surprised if RAM of all things is a big factor in Corsair's sales, they have quite a bit of good competition there.

The high end processes are something like TSMC's 7nm and below. There's a shortage there as well, but not so prominent, as big players which need it (Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, etc etc) have reserved capacity well in advance anyway, and these chips are expensive, so not a lot of places where they can be used, except when you need the absolute best in performance per cm2. This is basically just PC/console CPUs and GPUs, maybe some motherboard ICs and SSDs (have no idea about the manufacturing of SSDs so). 

On the other hand, PSUs, DRAM, headsets, keyboards, mouses, stream decks and all the other shit CRSR sells uses cheap legacy nodes for its ICs, because they're not really very complicated or compute-intensive chips and so it's much better if they are cheap than efficient. These categories are a race to the bottom anyway, no matter how high end your brand is. This is what the automotive industry needs as well, and what Biden wants to relieve. 

The shortage there is a much bigger problem, but also easier to solve, as there's a metric fuckton of fabs doing these old nodes, even in the US. A bit of capital injection to build more capacity (where it makes sense) can go a long way.

Now the risk of being bullish on CRSR just because of that is that the admin might do the absolute minimum to unblock automotive and related boomer industries, and it might still take some time until CRSR finds some capacity for their stuff even after your gov steps in.

I have purchased REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts), medical, tech, electric car, green energy, and a variety of other stocks. But one thing I almost always buy for is long-term growth.

Find industries that you can see a bright future in, but a few shares then hold them for at least a year.  This timeframe helps to avoid the short-term capital gains taxes AND gives the stock a chance to truly grow and show it's potential.

I had Apple a few years ago and sold after 2 years, didn't see much gain then, but had I waited another year or two I would have seen bonkers returns. I recently bought a fractional share of Tesla and it goes up.

The best long-term stocks for me have actually been OHI (a REIT that pays awesome consistent dividends AND has grown), SPCE (Virgin Galactic), and finally, my biggest winner is AXON (they make tasers and bodycams). AXON has gone up 393% since I first purchased it 4 years ago.

Short-term stock bets can be awesome, but they are very hard to predict unless you are closely following the business, what they are doing, and their economic fundamentals as reported in their 10K and 10Q filings.

* In order for things to reopen, we have to achieve herd immunity. Donald Trump, whether you like him or not, helped our pharma chads get their big fuck bualls, and they produced us a couple of fine vaccines in the scope of 9 months. Nice.

* Right now, we have about 20% of the population vaccinated. I know all of us REEtahds are sitting inside with our tendies and binky blankets trying to stay warm, since we lost our fuckin' bill and lunch money on GME, but the vaccination per day rate is 1.5 to 1.6 million. Now, that puts us on pace for herd immunity, which is around 60~70% of the population sometime in July or August. Right in time for summer block busters.

* They paid off like 600 million in debt thanks to our retardation and squonking, which gives them survivability for the next six to seven months.

* The movies are one of the most romanticized things in our culture. They are an outing. A thing to do. A place to take a date. No woman wants to go to your smelly ratty fuckin' neckbeard nest, and dive over mountains of diet coke cans, pizza boxes, and jizz rags/socks to watch a movie with you for the first time.

* Democrat governors immediately rolled over when Biden got elected, and opened businesses again. Don't think for a moment these nozzle gobblers won't trade your ass for economic gain. Dead men tell no tales, ya fuckin' neuro-divergent.

* At least you have a chance of coming back, and fucking making a PROFIT on AMC if you stay in and pray for recovery.

They could include in the streaming fee live viewing in cinemas for select movies or series, the gamepass idea but actually viable and not on all cinemas. Imagine a hit series the caliber of Game of Thrones with weekly episode releases and having the option to view the episode in the cinema on release as it's included in your streaming fee. For other streaming platforms such a move would cost them alot more money and time to open locations than it would take for AMC to go on streaming. Holding 200 at 5.5.

You made both the right and the correct choice but let's assume by some twist of fate AMC just kept going up and up and up. The correct choice would obviously be to hold, however, the right choice was still to sell, because you made the money you wanted to make. 

Realizing gains is never a mistake. The correct choice is obviously to always hold until the very peak, buy at the very bottom, and bet on the number that's about to come up on the wheel. But because we don't know what those are going to be we can only estimate and set a jumping of point.

It is no coincidence that this round happened after the Ryan Cohen board settlement. There are just too many shares owned by too many people that, if enough are recalled, are going to leave someone being forced to deliver a share that doesn't exist. Remember this happens even if float 50% short = float is 150% owned and if 101% shares recalled the last 1% of shorts to figure out they're fukt are really fucked.

1684,GME," I bought GME in November before I read about The Big Squeeze^TM  Some news came out about Cohen moving to revitalize GME and Michael Burry buying large holdings in it. The squeeze was just the cherry on top. Sometime in January, I sold a chunk of shares at $100 to cover my holdings and make a little profit. Later, I put in a sell order for $300 that I didn't set as GTC, only day expiration. Oops. It missed that trigger. I should have reused that order, but then greed got the best of me and I watched it rise even more then come crashing down. 

In hindsight, I should have sold when the stock price was still high and lock in those profits, but I intended to hold onto this stock at least until I saw what Cohen and gang were going to do with the company. Either way, even if the stock crashes down to basically nothing, I'll still make at least some profit out of it. At the price I bought into, GME would have to come down to bargain basement prices for me to realize a loss with my remaining shares. At that point, I'd likely buy some more.

1714,CMPS," Anyone who has experienced psilocybin knows the potential for this medicine in the mental health space.  It‚Äôs far beyond anything current anti-depressants offer in terms of efficacy and long-term results.  It‚Äôs treating the root cause of the thoughts which produce many of the undesired negative effects, instead of simply numbing people to the world.  It envokes a greater empathy, appreciation, and understanding for the world around us.  These feelings persist long after the psilocybin has gone.  Cannabis treats some physical ailments, but does nothing for mental health and actually interacts negatively with most current anti-depression medicines.  Studies on ketamine are well documented and have blown current depression medicines out of the water.  Psilocybin results are the same if not better and and now only have to complete the regulatory hurdles required to prescribe.
The companies working on these medicines have the best doctors, scientist and researchers in the pharmaceutical and mental health space currently because they know this is big.

From what I have understand from others it is just another number based one. I am not saying it won't go through after all super harmful meds go through all the time these days. 

I think shrooms are a great way to treat depression, anxiety and ptsd. I feel like for smoking it is probably as affective as hypnosis. Which means it will get approved for it just for the money probably.

1734,CEO," Good question.

I have a target sell price of $3.50, then I'll return to mutual funds.  The best advice is probably the same from anyone - do your research.  The trend up started in November 2020 when main stream media started speculating on new ideas and stocks to invest in, and there's a great article over at investopedia about how each of the shroom companies are positioning to disrupt big pharma.  

I didn't want to buy in the bubble, so I picked up SHRMF specifically because of the BCSC trading halt and the price freeze - there's a lot of active chatter on Yahoo Finance about some pretty respected shroom investors calling the BCSC for details, trying to find out what the deal was / when the halt would be lifted / if Champignon is cooperating, and it was all encouraging; combined with them opening a new clinic in the last month, hiring a new CFO to sort out their filing paperwork ... its a pretty solid story for me.   Having a doctor as a CEO who does research and starts a company to explore new treatment options, finding your company is outgrowing your preparation for expansion, then your stock takes off, and you're not prepared for it...not really surprised.

Keep in mind that its perspective though.  $40k is a decent amount of coin, but its my ""play"" fund.  If I lose it, that sucks, but it won't cripple me.  I was either going to go to Vegas and YOLO $40k to martingale the European roulette table at the MGM grand (1:1 bets, $25 - $10,000 outside limits), or do this; and between my work schedule, Covid, vacation planning, tightening comps in Vegas, the need to hit the table off-peak...meh.

To differentiate themselves, what a lot of these companies are doing now is making novel compounds, like with Mindmed's 18-MC compound or what Cybin is doing with their patents - making a psychedelic substance similar to the uncle ben's stuff, but slightly altered. Either that, or they are trying to obtain first mover advantage into the psychedelic therapy space, such as what CMPS and FTRPF are doing.

1807,OPEN," The reality for a lot of you is this: Welcome to the real world!!! Did you really think a game played by the mega wealthy was something you were going to just pick up and understand in a single week by joining a subreddit? God I hope not, but some of you seem to have honestly believed that. 

Let me be clear: THIS GAME IS RIGGED. And it ain‚Äôt in your favor. Hedge funds have thousand dollar Bloomberg terminals with real-time data on everything you could possibly imagine. You got shitty mobile graphs with timing delays and Bid-ask spreads wide enough to buy a dollar menu meal. Don‚Äôt know what that means? You just proved my point above! You ain‚Äôt beating the Melvin Capitals of the world, they‚Äôre beating you. You bested them one time and look what they just did to everyone on weed. Why? How? Because billions are on the line!! They aren‚Äôt gonna let a fucking OPEN FORUM CHAT beat them! They‚Äôre data-mining the ever loving SHIT out of this sub, and planning five steps ahead of you and laughing their rich assess off while they write call options so far above market price they‚Äôll never be triggered even if you had 100 years to wait. But you bought them anyway!!!

So, now the Final Jeopardy question: what does this all mean and what should I do? Answer: *LEARN*.

Don‚Äôt come on here asking which stock to buy or when to enter a price. That ain‚Äôt anyone‚Äôs business except your own risk appetite. And if you are asking these questions, YOU ARE GUARANTEED TO LOSE MONEY. Because it means you aren‚Äôt learning, you‚Äôre looking for an easy gain. And if that‚Äôs what you really want, go to a fucking casino (hint: the house always wins there too!!!). Come here and learn the strategies, learn the metrics that matter to investors, learn the lingo, learn how options pricing ACTUALLY WORKS, and above all, learn WHY a stock is moving (memes and popularity is usually a huge red flag). The only way we win and make a true change to the market is by us collectively educating ourselves on the market and how the major players use it.

1811,GME," We don‚Äôt control the fizz that comes out and we most certainly don‚Äôt control the market.

22 billion got pumped into GME from supposedly the people on here.

That‚Äôs a lot of money but ultimately it‚Äôs diddly squat to what those controlling the market can summon.

The 1% stay the 1% because they control the companies, hedge funds, trust funds, governments and who knows what else that control the markets and 22 billion whilst being a lot of money isn‚Äôt going to stop them.

I‚Äôd love it to be different.

I‚Äôm editing this post and continuing on from what I said above.....

The truth is... we the 99% do actually have the power to stick it to the 1% but in order to do that it would take co-ordination.
 
For starters... no one ultimately really knows who makes up the 1%, it‚Äôs most likely corporations for the most part (which are owned by shareholders), we often think of the 1% as being greedy hoovers of money, but think about it... what does a corporation want to do? 

Make money for its shareholders, which means top to bottom the emphasis is on doing just that and not always in the most ethical manner.

If we really want to make a difference here we should start by figuring who / what really is the 1%.

Then we should look at who/what are being ethical about it, of course that‚Äôs a scratchy subject and everyone has their views.... my take would be if it‚Äôs not good for future incoming generations then it‚Äôs not ethical. 

Once we did this.. we could look to set some targets.

22 billion + of investment isn‚Äôt a lot against a massive hedge fund. 

However against one single billionaire entity targeted in the right manner it could just give us the 99% control and we can then build on from that. 

We‚Äôre not going to be able to take over Facebook, or Amazon, or Apple, Tesla or any other mainstream company worth hundreds of billions, we‚Äôve got to look within our means, however we just might be able to find one out there that looks like a good bet, coordinate a combined attack and who knows maybe even take it over. 

The Uber rich have been staying that way for generations because they never let go, they set up trusts for their families who all work for said trust and more often than not generate further wealth for said trust, these trusts frequently own very large corporations. 

Ultimately there is nothing to stop the 99% combining their power and doing the same. 

If we buy the companies then give those companies our dollars by buying things from them essentially we‚Äôd be keeping our money, that‚Äôs what the rich have been doing for eons.

If people here really want to be a force and make a difference, create caos and fear, then let‚Äôs organise it in the right manner.",Nutisbak2,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhx77s/ok_everybody_needs_to_take_a_few_deep_breaths_and/gn00tbf/,0.054,0.811,0.136,0.9932

But its not illegal to post the name of a stock.  Imagine the amounts of money we could make.  Fucking scary actually.  This would be a coordinated attack.  Every month.  

Seems like a fantasy, but it is as simple as that.  One poster/Leader. Not 1000. 1 stock a month.  Everyone together.  I just blew my own fucking mind.  It is kind of what happened to GME.  I feel terrible for those who lost money. I bought at 400.  But this way every month everyone would have a solid chance to make a fortune.

1975,RH," Robin literally sells the order flow; they don't execute a trade themselves.  That means 1)you aren't getting the best price.  If you say ""buy market order"" you'll get a little higher than ""market"".  If you give a specific price that you thin is market (best option BTW if you use RH, you might now even get executed.  2)They also publish your stop orders, so the MM or funds can see where you want to sell or buy and can get a sense for here the buy/sell pressure will be.  That helps them, and also might hurt you by letting the stock drift to your sell/buy, and then drift back.

2014,ABC," Let's say you try purchasing 1000 shares of ABC for $10.00.

In Robinhood, your limit order of $10.00 each will probably fill at $10.00 each.

In Fidelity, your limit order of $10.00 each might fill at $9.97 each.

Robinhood is letting firms 'scalp' that difference from you behind the scenes (hence why it got sued). So just from buying at 2 different brokerages, Fidelity gives you $30 more on just the buy side.

And when you sell, say there's huge spreads. You decide to sell at market order for fast sell. At Robinhood, you might be selling each at $11 while at Fidelity, you might be selling at $11.04 each. So basically, you got $70 more at end of day just by using a better brokerage.

So ya... you get the idea. And since Fidelity is also free trading, just shows how bad of a brokerage Robinhood is.

&#x200B;

And for options contract, since each contract is 100 shares, you can see how much better it is to pay $0.65 per contract than opting for Robinhood's free path. That said, Fidelity does sell option order data (still miles better than Robinhood at filling) unlike stock orders. If you don't want that and you really need better price, then you generally opt for like TastyWorks/IBKR Pro for options trading.

Imagine on more extreme cases when Robinhood 'scalps' 1 dollar difference a share on a contract (because huge spreads due to meme stock effect). That means 1 contract (100 shares) is $100 stolen from you for 'free options trade' in which other brokerages would have given you if you were just willing to pay $0.65 a contract up front.",Fwellimort,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhzfk6/fidelity_sells_your_options_order_data_too_only/gn30i8q/,0.036,0.845,0.119,0.9735

I sold my TSLA and AMZ stocks to fund my weed stock craze, because those were silly and speculative, but this weed thing was a sure thing.  Fuck sake.  Need a retarded person?  I‚Äôm your man.

It feels good to be back in the black.

2157,ACB," Bro!  How can you say weed is not a long term play?  I think some of us have different definitions of long term.  Long term by definition is over one year, but in the grand scheme of things, one year is a very short investment.  A lot of us are making money really fast, so we look at something 6 months down the line as a long term play, but its not.  Long term means five years minimum, but really 10-20 years.  I have had Netflix and FB for 6-7 years and have made amazing money over time.  They have good periods and bad periods, but over time they always win.  Significantly.

2191,THC," they acquired did acquire a small craft brewer in the US. 

The issue is that neither Aphria or Tilray owns a single license to grow or sell recreational cannabis in the US. On top of this, when decriminalization occurs, it's highly unlikely they will allow importing a recreational drug from Canada into the US across international borders. It may happen eventually years down the line, but highly unlikely it's immediate.

States that have gone full legal like California and Colorado are matured and heavily saturated markets that will be difficult to penetrate. The money will be in limited license states like New York or New Jersey.  They will need to either invest and spend money in order to enter into the US or they will need to merge with or acquire a US company. Otherwise, all they will be able to do is sell beer that does not contain THC. This will prove to be difficult for them as once the merger is completed their combined cash to debt position wont be pretty and they will most likely need to dilute shareholders or do raises in order to remain competitive. 

Ask anyone who has been investing in this sector for years what the general consensus on Tilray was before Aphria offered to merge with them. They were considered one of the worst companies to invest in.

These two companies are merging for survival and the headlines about them being the ""the biggest cannabis company in the world"" are pumpy at best and everyone is falling for it. Once the US passes cannabis reform, Aphria/Tilray will be lucky if they are even in the top 5. 

Their saving grace may be international/Europe, but those cannabis markets are still several years from being developed. The money in the next 2 years will be in the US.

The hype for Aphria/Tilray will will be short lived as reality will eventually set in that they are NOT well positioned to take advantage of US decriminalization.",qwertysac,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/li13n1/weedstocks_destroyer_of_wealth/gn2sru2/,0.07,0.845,0.085,0.5771

\-Drones could minimise net carbon emissions, reduce reliance on fossil-fuels and STAFF COSTS ON DELIVERY SERVICES.  


In 2021 they ordered ¬£100,000 built-to-spec electric vans from Rivian.  
Shit still needs someone to actually deliver the package.  
\-Drones would reduce STAFF COSTS ON DELIVERY SERVICES.  


Drones, if developed correctly, would provide quick, accurate, low-cost delivery services for the majority of Amazon's client base.  It could expand their same-day delivery service across the globe.  It would cut staffing costs and reliance on contractors substantially.

2335,MSM," Both ends of the extreme of this have it confused.  On the one end you have the ""Fake News"" crowd, they are full on ""the MSM lies, you can't believe anything they say"".  Then on the other end, like you mentioned, there are those gobble up MSNBC or Fox as if what they say is holy gospel.

As usual, the truth somewhere is the middle.  Facts are facts, the MSM can't just make things up or outright lie.  When they do occasionally try this they get called out pretty fast and have to make a retraction (whether or not people ever see them get called out or ever see the retraction is another issue entirely). 

As long as media business models are profit motivated there will always be bias.  Being an informed consumer of information involves recognizing those biases.  The bias will motivate them to only tell half the story, or tell half truths.  Or they put the lie off onto another organization to cover their own ass.  They are engaged in a conspiracy where in the participants never need to talk to each other about their conspiracy.  Their goals and desires just happen to fall in line with each other.  It's the most air tight kind of conspiracy out there, there's a lot of them going on too.

Before I ramble too much, this financial and investor news is completely foreign to me.  I have never really dealt with it, so I don't know how far they push their lies.  But it's seems pretty fucking far, which makes sense, there is A LOT of money behind these lies.  It seems to me that if RobinHood hadn't stopped gamestock buys that Thursday, there would have been a small market implosion.  The market fuckery gave them time to cover their asses more affordably.  I dunno, I am still sitting on 12 shares, because I never got to see the moon, I hadn't been following the stock for 2 years waiting for this to happen.

The executive team has talked about the price coming down to $40,000 with enough volume over a few years which should broaden the market. But more importantly as the technology proves itself the accessibility of this changes the game from space tourism to practical hypersonic travel and hopefully price becomes even more comparable to, say, flying the Concord.

2433,AMC," It‚Äôs not a pump and dump when trying to get visibility in different investor forums for a company trying to save lives with their pipeline of life saving drugs. DNA medicine is coming into its own and leveraging the power of supercomputers and sophisticated algorithms to provide remedies that rna and mRNA cannot or are too slow to provide. Masses get behind dying stocks like AMC, GameStop, and Blackberry... why not get behind a company that is trying to provide stable cures for the planet?! Shorts like Citron, Muddy Waters, and others have been keeping downward pressure on this company. Big Pharma is afraid of Inovio and the seismic shift it will bring to pharmaceuticals.

Other things to think about:
- No cold chain required and is thermally stable at room temperature over a year
- Proven efficacy, +94% effective 
- Has gone through rigorous peer review, something Pfizer and Moderna have not done
- Tested in animals (ferrets and Macaques), proving effective while offering at least 4 months of T cell memory when the virus was reintroduced 
- Side effects essentially amount to slight redness to the injected area, nothing severe has ever been reported
- INO-4800 is boostable, Pfizer and Moderna are not

2434,DD," It‚Äôs not a pump and dump when trying to get visibility in different investor forums for a company trying to save lives with their pipeline of life saving drugs. DNA medicine is coming into its own and leveraging the power of supercomputers and sophisticated algorithms to provide remedies that rna and mRNA cannot or are too slow to provide. Masses get behind dying stocks like AMC, GameStop, and Blackberry... why not get behind a company that is trying to provide stable cures for the planet?! Shorts like Citron, Muddy Waters, and others have been keeping downward pressure on this company. Big Pharma is afraid of Inovio and the seismic shift it will bring to pharmaceuticals.

Other things to think about:
- No cold chain required and is thermally stable at room temperature over a year
- Proven efficacy, +94% effective 
- Has gone through rigorous peer review, something Pfizer and Moderna have not done
- Tested in animals (ferrets and Macaques), proving effective while offering at least 4 months of T cell memory when the virus was reintroduced 
- Side effects essentially amount to slight redness to the injected area, nothing severe has ever been reported
- INO-4800 is boostable, Pfizer and Moderna are not
- Billions of doses can be manufactured with the consortium of plasmid developers Inovio has assembled 
- Innovative Cellectra administration device provides electrical stimulation to open cell pores for improved vaccine uptake

Aight I was just going to throw in my $0.02, but I don't have anything to do today beside a meeting in 45. So I have my undergrad in molecular biology, and frequently talk to my relatives who are physicians that teach at medical schools about biotech developments.

I come from a science background so I'm going to use clinical data, or peer-reviewed sources when I can. 

>DNA medicine is coming into its own and leveraging the power of supercomputers and sophisticated algorithms.

Literally everyone is leveraging cloud computing, and using machine learning to develop for discover/develop drugs. [This isn't new, or exclusive to them](https://emerj.com/ai-sector-overviews/machine-learning-drug-discovery-applications-pfizer-roche-gsk/).

>to provide remedies that rna and mRNA cannot or are too slow to provide

So DNA, RNA, and mRNA are made of molecules called nucleotides. Information moves from gene to protein through DNA -> mRNA -> protein. Think of it like a blueprint for a house with DNA being the master blueprint, and RNA being the one the foreman uses. As long as the foreman has a copy of the correct blueprint it will be built correctly. You can get the exact same treatment with mRNA. There is nothing slow about it. 

>No cold chain required and is thermally stable at room temperature over a year.

This is true, but has nothing to do with an innovation produced by them. DNA itself is very stable because it is double stranded. That's it. 

> Has gone through rigorous peer review, something Pfizer and Moderna have not done.

GME had so many people saying why it would continue going up even after trading was restricted. Do I believe it was manipulated hardcore? Yes. Is it my fault I didn't sell? Yes.

I think anyone involved in these massive spike ups should 100% take their profits when they have them. What is going on isn't a value play where you will see it keep going up without large drops. It's going to drop massively soon and then that would be the time to get back in if you truly believe it will be a good play longterm.

Finished the day up huge, I immediately called a friend and said, ""This is bizarre... are we in a short squeeze?"" Then came to WSB and saw APHA trending and thought, ""Oh, shit.""
Next day, huge gains.  I figured, worst case, it comes back down to where I bought in.  Let's see what happens.  Part greed, part me ALWAYS buying and holding.  I never day trade, and wasn't comfortable selling so quickly.

I don't agree with you, about that being boomer only advice.
I'm 47.  I've been doing the same strategy as my family has taught me for 30 years...
I could retired this year. 
First time I could say that. 
It's BECAUSE of those buy and holds.
But let me elaborate? 
Buy and hold isn't dickies. 
It isn't 'action' less.
Buy and Hold means, when you find yourself using a new product, a lot, and you love the product, and you go find out it's a public company, you dig deep and you put a fucking STAKE in that product.  You put your money where your mouth is, and you back away. 
Or sometimes, you get that feeling from a BIG COMPANY that does something new.  Like when Facebook bought Occulus - I saw (and still see) exactly what they want to do there, and I was 100% all in. 
And when AAPL misses earnings?  And craters?
It takes giant size balls not to sell. 
And when your friend tells you GME is going to take off, and it starts to, and EVERY DAY it's going higher and higher, and your finger is on the trigger to buy...
But you remember...
You don't buy games at GameStop.  You buy them on Amazon, or on Xbox.  
And the few times you've gone into Gamestop, it's been 'okay', but not great.  Smells a little funny.  
So you have the fucking discipline to sit on your hands and not invest in the trend. 
That takes some character too.
So for all these reasons, I think my family's variation on buy and hold isn't just for Boomers, but for me personally, as a Gen Xer.
Now if you like day trades, and exit strategy, and options.  Fine!  There are plenty of games in the casino.
But when I go the casino?  I walk right past the table games, past the slots... right to the poker room.  That's my game, that's what I know, and there's plenty of money to be made.  

Yes, I should have taken the gains but I was caught unaware, and I WASN'T playing a day-trade, so I was really taken back.  A stop loss would have been a good idea too once it took off.

1) didn't buy at the top of a meme stock; not a reading major either I see

2) didn't blame them for my move: told them to fuck off, because they are manipulating the market.  Better?  90% of them don't even fucking realize.  It's literally like watching lemmings go over a cliff..

Problem is, they are landing on the little guy.

This may come as a surprise, but 'ignorance' when you are fucking around with other people's money doesn't work as an excuse.   The only thing happening right now is that this is all so new, the SEC and frankly the market itself doesn't know how to react.  Well, they didn't at least.  Now they do. They are squishing every newbie like they are little fucking bugs, which they are.  

I'll be fine.  In fact, I'm already back to within a grand thanks to the push today. 

But you need to seriously wake the fuck up and take a look at what's happening.  The people on this sub certainly don't understand.  My post is to get people thinking:

WSB is actively manipulating markets like a hedge fund.  But the only amazing thing is, 90% of them literally don't even realize they are doing it. 

Truly historic times.  

I suggest everyone check WSB at this point before making ANY stock purchase, to find out if you are inadvertently run into one of their 'unintentional' market manipulation.

2775,DD," I like the DD and I am on your same thought train, went long on value in May (Aegon was one of my favs, very similar financials to this stock). However my main issues are (i) in the short term (1-3 years) growth stocks will outperform by a big margin. The most common valuation models are in their favor. (e.g. CAPM - risk free rate is lower, required market return is higher simply because of higher volatility. This is contrary to normal market expectations because of the FED stepping in so damn hard. FED is influencing all the components in the equation)
(ii) inflation is picking up speed, break even rate clocked in 2,22% in the last days and as you said, we are far from being out of stimulus + QE. That is why I‚Äôm banking hard on high leverage equities based on commodities. In short: great safe and value play, but I kinda got bored of it, I want some action.

2809,HD," I had offers from Open Door, Offer Pad and Zillow.

Offer Pad's inspector was NOT qualified to do inspections, she took pictures on an ipad and they concluded the inspection at the office. Came back with a bunch of bullshit, they wanted to replace the south facing front door because the paint was fading, they wanted to replace a bathroom sink because there was a small stain on it, they wanted to resurface the less than 10 year old pebble-tech pool because it had some fading, etc. I don't remember the exact figures, I can't find the documents, but they wanted something like $35K in repairs. And their offer was lower than Open Door to begin with. Zillow's offer was a non-starter, it was lower than Offer Pad's final price without even quoting me any repairs.

Open Door's inspector was an experienced home inspector and explained a number of things to me, he told me they have a buffer built into the offer price for repairs so small things he's noting I won't even hear about, and that was true. He told me I didn't have to leave the fridge behind, which I didn't realize because it came with the house, so now I have a garage fridge. They also sent out a roofing company to inspect the roof, and a pool company to inspect the pool

He told me that if he came in after I moved out and found ceiling fans missing, he'd just put a cap on the wires and call it a day, I wasn't a total asshole, I went to HD and bought the cheapest fans and replaced my fancy ones.

They finally requested $880 credit for repairs (pool pump, siding, paint for my office that had a non-neutral paint). And they allowed me to leave my storage pod in the driveway for a few days after the sale as we were still finalizing the next house. I went back to get the pod and the pressure washing guy was there, and then I went back a few times to get the mail that hasn't been forwarded properly yet, and sure enough the pool pump was fixed (raised off the ground, leaky pipe fixed, broken valves replaced), the siding was replaced, and from the listing pictures I see that they repainted the office and bathroom, and they patched nail holes in all the walls.

So final amount transferred to me was Offer price - 5% service charge - $880.00 repairs.

Mind you you don't have to deal with any realtors, so that 5% (6% even) service charge would have been spent on realtors going a traditional route anyway. I didn't have to worry about showings or bargaining with buyers, they sent a notary to my house with the paperwork that needed to be wet signed, everything else was signed electronically, and I had my money wired to my account the next day.

In the back of my mind I'm hoping there's another squeeze, but I accepted it by Wednesday this week that it prob won't happen. I will hold this stock forever though, so that when GME goes bankrupt, they will have robbed me of 60 bucks one last time. I will shed one manly tear for them.

2917,OR," Disclaimer: I own 100 shares at around 19.50, I chew on sharpies in my free time, and I have no training as a financial analyst.  


First and foremost, you are retarded. It definitely is a risky investment but you my friend, may be even more retarded than me.   


Their company is not propped up around battery cooling. Their main product/service is converting the entire drive train on an existing Semi resulting in a carbon-negative Hybrid truck that runs on existing infrastructure, aka diesel fuel and compressed natural gas(CNG).  


They are also accepting preorders for their ERX truck which is again a Hybrid that runs on existing infrastructure. AKA, no need to install chargers at the headquarters of your fleet.  


For example: You have a business with 100 Semis. You can sell your fleet, which might be hard considering the whole world is pivoting to EVs, and buy 100 Tesla Semis at a base of price 150,000 each, or $150,000,000 for the entire fleet not to mention the FUCKLOAD of chargers you are going to need.

OR you can ring up Hyliion and pay to convert your existing fleet into Hybrids at roughly 30k(Not confirmed, I heard this number somewhere last year around the time I bought) a piece, or $30,000,000 for the entire fleet. 1/5 of the price and your semis can still refuel at existing stations.  


Also the company is aware they are losing money and don't expect to turn a profit until this year. While there are definitely risks, there is also an upside. Also if you dig around for half a second you'd see that their Hypertruck actually works and doesn't just roll down hills.

2956,VFF, thats not true of the 6 top growers in the world half still have big out door fields. with most growing in agriculture greenhouses not indoor warehouses. The only companies that are hard focused on warehouse growing (which is massively more expensive then outdoor or greenhouse) is Canadian companies like aurora and canopy growth. Also Canadian companies are going to have a hard time interring the us market due to states laws with licensing. The legalization of weed in the US will have a small impact on Canadian growers unless they have already set up systems in the states and have the licensing. Take VFF for example while I think they have room to grow after legalization they may never be able to get the product out of Texas totally killing most profitability of the land they just got out there.,boomboom4132,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liiuko/exposing_sundial_growers_ticker_sndl/gn3lio1/,0.065,0.829,0.106,0.6506

2981,GME," OP's thesis is not a good use of your capital.  Even GME (pleas fly again?) has better odds.

Odds of the Biden administration, Congress,  or SCOTUS doing anything that materially changes Fannie/Freddie's conservatorship status is as close as you can get to absolute ZERO.  Why?

Politicians:  
With Dems controlling all Executive and Legislative power, they will be doing what they do best: engaging in profligate spending to be paid for by future generations.  Fannie/Freddie are significant cash inflows to the US govt.  If that money doesn't come in and goes to greedy capitalists/shareholders instead, then not only does their hard left support base eviscerate them, but that amount of spend now has to come from somewhere else...i.e., more debt or higher taxes (which Dems don't have the slightest qualms about, but why go down that road if you don't have to?)  Politicos will choose the path of least resistance every time.  

Judges:
The newly-minted conservative-leaning Supreme Court is mindful of its power and its reputation, and will be very careful about how majority decisions are perceived.  They want to avoid the appearance of political/idealogical decisions, and will likely go to great lengths to avoid that and pick their major battles carefully.  It might be a bit different if Fannie/ Freddie were true private sector companies...but they've always been quasi-governmental entities, so SCOTUS will (as in past litigation involving them), probably defer to Congress/Treasury in how they want to manage the cashflow from these companies.  This is not the hill the conservative Justices choose to plant their flag and fight to the death.

2982,GME," You youngin's rang the old timers?

You kids are killing it out here.

Congratulations to you all. This recent WSB saga reminded me of the days of $SRPT and the Bio Catalyst Calendar. 800% IV. GME didn't even hit that Vol.

If WSB was really looking to do something fun with this trade, staking out a position in the preferreds for the 96,000,000 reasons I've laid out for like a decade.

Now, because of the capital structure, the Senior preferreds are essentially Preferred Equity, Jr. Preferreds are essentially common stock with a ceiling, and the common are like options. Then there are the warrants. 

Since Treasury owns both the Sr.'s and warrants, the fulcrum security are the Jr. preferreds.

Think of this like a seesaw.

If you own the fulcrum on the seesaw and begin buying the common stock enmass, it pushes the seesaw to its limits. By raising the price of the common, you raise the price of the preferreds, AND, you drive up the value of Treasury's warrants.

If WSB ran this like you all ran $GME, you would make the United States Government $300B, you would force a settlement between the government & litigating shareholders (because the government could exercise their warrants and the sell common stock during a secondary for recap, but only after the Jr. Preferreds were made whole), and you would shift $6T in mortgage guarantees from the taxpayer to private shareholders!

If you want to stick it to the man while doing your country a public service, buy $FNMAS, then start buying $FNMA & $FMCC.

If they haul me into to testify like /u/deepfuckingvalue, it won't be my first rodeo.

This is how it will go:

I have to testify, I will submit my opening statement, as is customary. 

Then I will will go off script detailing all of Congressional trades with information they had prior to the public's knowledge, the Billionaires pumping & dumping on Twitter, and end with, ""Now what do you want to do with this information? It's not part of the Congressional Record until you gavel it in. If you don't accept it, then our time is done together and you can't call me again to testify on this matter. If you enter it, all of your dirty laundry is now enshrined for eternity. End the hearing and pretend it never happened? Great. 

Nance? 

See You Next Tuesday, sweetheart.

3114,UK," I've been in the automotive industry longer than Tesla have been making cars, I mostly do chassis development, but obviously that ties in with everything, so I've had a decent amount of exposure to multiple commodity owners across many OEM's. For all you know though, I could by lying, but I don't have any automotive stock, because I'm not allowed due to insider trading laws in my country, so I don't have a horse in this race.

Legacy OEMs have been testing autonomous driving on the roads for years, they're not risk takers like Tesla. In fact, Tesla's autonomous driving testing is rarely approved outside the US because it's not developed enough, where as Daimler, R/N and Toyota have been approved across the board.

Tesla being in the US has the advantage of being the most basic road network in the world, very easy roads for very simple drivers, Tesla essentially release all of their software in beta, and use their customers as testers. The US government allows this, no other nation does, which is why it seems Tesla is ahead, if you're simply a consumer.

You really need to look at the wider world. The US isn't a particularly good country for automotive technology. Japan, Germany and the UK are years ahead, and have larger talent pools and experience.

Tesla has psuedo-data, it has miles of logs, but only around very similar, simple network system. There is a reason Tesla autonomous systems aren't being widely operated outside of the US, and Tesla are doing a lot of R&D in the UK, Finland and Spain, as soon as a simple road network stops, Tesla's autopilot system truly can't understand the road network. 99% of roads aren't city, or highway, in the UK for example, Toyota can only has a 65% success rate of a 10 mile planned drive in rural Saitama.

If you take a similar test case: Tesla model X 2020MY, it completed ~6% of the testing in rural Wales.

I think Tesla are market leaders in battery technology, or at least, in the top 3, but they're not even in the top 5 when I comes to autonomous driving development. Remember, autonomous driving and electric cars aren't mutually exclusive.

I'll bet 90% of the people that bought or spammed the daily thread didn't read that press release.

Also I have read the press release listened to the interview with the ceo and read various release docs.

It doesn't even matter how good the story is, it's rapid boom & bust cycle. I missed calls on the way up because it seemed so minute that I couldn't see it going the extra 2 it did from when I saw it. But, I have a very strong idea what happens next.
