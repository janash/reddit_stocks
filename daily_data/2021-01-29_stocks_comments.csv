I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.  Disclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: **We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market.** Do I have your attention?  Here goes:

1. Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.

2. Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.

3. Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

4. Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

5. At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

6. Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

7. The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: **The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.**  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital.  They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.  I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said **a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him.**  Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true?  It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to [this remarkable (if infuriating) interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM) where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  **DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""?** Hello!

10,A," **Sign the petition here: https://www.change.org/p/u-s-securities-and-exchange-commission-sec-retail-investors-demand-market-transparency-please-sec-amend-form-13f-requirements**


Retail Investors demand more visibility into institutional trading and borrowing. Anyone investing over 1 billion dollars (i.e. hedge funds and other investment institutions) is required to disclose their holdings to promote transparency in our markets - it's called Form 13-F. **But did you know that they only need to disclose it 4 times a year? And did you know that they don't need to disclose all of their positions?**


We the people are asking for a re-evaluation of transparency requirements for Institutional Investors. We have access to technology and data gives us new sophistication - and are beginning to understand there is a tremendous disparity in access between retail and institutional investors, and are concerned that this access is being used against us, in ways that we genuinely worry could be in flagrant violation of Securities Laws. We believe that with better access to institutional trading data, retail investors can better participate in the market when making buying and selling decisions.


**According to Form 13F (https://www.sec.gov/files/form13f.pdf), Institutional Investors only need to disclose their positions 4 times a year. Why?**


*Filing of Form 13F. A Manager must file a Form 13F report with the Commission within 45 days after the end of each calendar year and each of the first three calendar quarters of each calendar year. As required by Section 13(f)(5) of the Exchange Act, a Manager which is a bank, the deposits of which are insured in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, must file with the appropriate regulatory agency for the bank a copy of every Form 13F report filed with the Commission pursuant to this subsection by or with respect to such bank. Filers who file Form 13F electronically can satisfy their obligation to file with other regulatory agencies by sending (a) a paper copy of the EDGAR filing (provided the Manager removes or blanks out the confidential access codes); (b) the filing in electronic format, if the regulatory agency with which the filing is being made has made provisions to receive filings in electronic format;*


**In your FAQ (https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13ffaq.htm), it is clear Institutional Investors are not required to disclose short positions. Why?**


*Question 41
Q: What about short positions?
A: You should not include short positions on Form 13F. You also should not subtract your short position(s) in a security from your long position(s) in that same security; report only the long position.*

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.

29,GME," It's truly fucked up, they must have really been in deep shit if they pulled something as obvious as this in order to get the price back down.  This is one step away from just going into the system and changing the price to $100, or sending out an email notifying every that due to a glitch in the system we sold all your shares.  You realize these ideas were probably brought up at some point.

What would be the full impact if they didn't slam the brakes?  I know everyone wants to say 'a few hedge fund billionaires would lose money' but that's being a bit dismissive.  We saw what happened in the market yesterday and, well, it wasn't good.  We need to realize there may be a larger consequence to this than rich people losing money, it could crash the entire market.

As much as I want the little guy to win, if it means bringing down the house and wiping out my entire portfolio I am not so sure.  I think no matter how this ends a lot of people will be very hesitant before they shoot off a lowball target price so they can short a company.

Why the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: 

Take a look at this link ( https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme

If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on.

Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!!

Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. There's room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.

41,A," I'll never forget the only time my job was threatened.

I worked in a financial data provider. We provided many investment firms, funds, banks, etc with their data. Currencies trade constantly. The close price for a currency is the last reported trade for the day, within a specific timezone. The year end close - i.e. the last trade of the year - is especially important as it is used in a lot of different calculations and valuations for offshore funds.

One new years day I received a call telling me that the year end close for one currency was wrong. WTF does that even mean? I logged on, and had a look at the logs and timeseries. Everything looked mostly normal. There was a bit of volatility, which was unusual to happen leading up to midnight, but not unheard of. I checked our competitors and other sources and saw the exact same figure. 

I replied back saying that the data was correct, provided trades leading up to and after the trade used for the end-of-year close. There was like a percent spread over a time period. Nothing worry some at all. Except to the fund manager. 

Their fee was based on their fund's performance. And their fund had underperformed to a point that the 1% difference in the close they wanted versus were given meant that they couldn't pay themselves that fee (and also had to explain to their investors). 

I couldn't care about their issues. The data was correct and I closed the issue. An hour later I received a call from my boss. I explained the situation. I could have changed the data (I was one of 3 who had the rights), but correcting data was done rarely. A half hour after that, I received a call from my boss and his boss. We spoke about it. I was asked how quickly I could change the data. I lied and said it would take many hours, but it took me a few seconds. If we changed the end of year close, we'd have to notify all customers of the change. And explain why we had to do it. And get them to redo all of their calculations on their models, valuations, etc.

The third phone call included the c-level. And I was flat out given a choice: Change the data or change my job. 

That fund manager bitched and whined and moaned to our company owners enough that the execs got shat on, and of course we know in which direction shit flows.

So I changed it. And I let all our account managers know. And they spent weeks apologizing for all the additional work that the change that created a load of work for all our other clients who used that data.

So that's how I learned to hate fund managers.",lovethebacon,5,/r/stocks/comments/l7awnp/today_is_a_dark_day_for_traders/gl7yr7o/,0.073,0.899,0.028,-0.971

But here is the big problem, all that money they control isn't just those individuals, it is money from pension funds, it is money from massive amounts of families....

56,CEO," From a layman perspective (me) it looks very suspicious that rh is enacting on a policy change that resulted massive benefit to a client that its getting 40% of revenue from (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25946480) which is a clear conflict of interest

But at the same time Anthony Denier, CEO of Webull https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RS4JIEVyXM&feature=youtu.be is claiming that the clearing house (DTC) is increasing the fund requirement to prevent market crash like 2008

75,PNC," I had something similar happen to me: my mortgage escrow went up $20 while I was out of the country and I didn't notice, so my auto payment was $20 short each month. My auto payment was being *received* by PNC, and they were depositing it while issuing me a refund check for the *full amount*. After 4 months of this they put my house in preforeclosure and when I returned in month 5 I only had 2 weeks left or I would've lost my house to foreclosure from underpaying them a total of $80.

From my view of my bank account, it looked to me all along that I was paid up and my brother in law who was checking my mail never told me I had scores of notices from PNC, but it's still crazy that they can make this happen over such a small amount.

2. They could, that's always a risk, but things are so volatile right now that I don't even know what that share offering would look like.

when you short a stock, these are the literal steps:

- you borrow the stock now and sell it for $20
- you buy it later for $5
- you keep the profit of $15

if the time between borrow, sell, and buy is quick then it doesn't matter.  but if it takes a long time between and buy, the actual end of it, you have to pay an interest payment on it.  like you would any loan thing.

- borrow the stock and sell it at $20
- wait and............stock goes to $500?!??!?!? fuck what?
- ok so do i sell it now or try to wait more and see if it goes down to 5 like i thought it would?

so if you sell NOW, you lock in that you lose $480 per share.  OR, you keep the share AND you have to pay interest on this ""loaned"" out share that you got in the first place.

so all these hedge funds that shorted the GME stock, and have not sold the share yet, still have the loan, and are getting charged an interest on this loaned share.

so reddit users just sitting here owning this piece of stock, doing nothing the fuck else, is costing wall street tons of fucking money.  so as we saw this single bad overreach that brought down this one hedgefund already, it could have lasting affects on other funds too.  that's the big ripple effect he's talking about.",aManPerson,5,/r/stocks/comments/l7awnp/today_is_a_dark_day_for_traders/gl734k2/,0.078,0.79,0.132,0.9564

149,ALL," SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD UPVOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD HOLD HOLD! DONT GET PAPER HANDS DURING THE LAST HOUR, ITS WHAT THEY WANT!

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you’ll see today!!!

They didn’t exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold —> price goes down —> the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place —> price drops even more —> they keep doing that —> price drops lower every time —> but as long as we hold they weren’t able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don’t believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don’t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‘m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

• ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. • ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

• ⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. • ⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

They didn’t exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold —> price goes down —> the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place —> price drops even more —> they keep doing that —> price drops lower every time —> but as long as we hold they weren’t able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don’t believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don’t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‘m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

• ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. • ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

• ⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. • ⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

238,ALL," Fidelity. Here's how to transfer - this post was removed by the mods in w.s.b, and I don't know why:

# Transferring from RH to Fidelity

This process is actually very simple. Earlier, I used to move ""mature"" positions from RH to Fidelity. I moved all my positions today. This is how I did this:

1. Log on to your Fidelity trading account on a browser.
2. In a different tab, log on to your RH account. Go to your info, and copy your RHS account number. Focus back on the Fidelity tab after copying this number.
3. In the top right of the Fidelity home page, type ""transfer asset"". Click on the link, and you should be in the Transfer of Assets (TOA) page.
4. Click on ""Start a transfer""
5. In the ""Select your current firm"" field, type ""Robinhood"". It should show up as ""Robinhood Securities Llc."". Select that to go to the next step.
6. In the next screen, paste the previously copied RH account number, and select ""individual"" in the account type.
7. In the next screen, you can select a specific equity or the whole account. Like I mentioned above, earlier I used to transfer single equities, but today, I selected ""entire account"".
8. I know that this works as I have transferred other accounts into Fidelity in the past without an issue (once I had an incorrect cost-basis, but that was taken care of with a phone call).
9. Wait 2-3 days for your RH account to show nothing, and a day or two after that for everything to pop up on Fidelity.
10. Now, you may shut down the RH account. Make sure you download ALL transactions before you close out the account. Who knows whether RH will even exist by the time it's the next tax filing season.",shantired,393,/r/stocks/comments/l7tc1x/would_like_to_take_my_business_elsewhere_since_rh/gl95htk/,0.0,0.943,0.057,0.8957

The fidelity interface is nicer; does better job of filling in the number of stocks you own when selling.  Saves you from having to do math or track a number.  
TDA basic mobile is bad.  basic web interface is good and fast.  thinkorswim mobile and web are far better.  Hoping the basic web interface will improve this year because of them being aquirred.

TDA is better for research and the free training they provide.  Lots of free courses.

Fidelity takes longer to clear profits if I purchase stocks on margin.  tda gives me my money almost immediatly, with fidelity it can take days for the funds will be pending for a few days.  This is for withdraw purpose not additional funding of stocks.

342,RH," Not sure about USA but when you do transfer the assets, it is not instant in Canada.

Several platforms tell you it can take up 20-30 business days.

What it means is that you are able to trade right away but you cannot take the cash out until after 30 business days.

355,A," I'll try my best to explain!

Let's say I want to buy a toy from my friend John for $10, but I don't want to buy it right now. So we make deal that if I give him $1 (known as a premium), he'll hold onto the toy for me so I can buy it anytime I ask for $10 until the end of the year.


A month rolls around, and the toy is now worth not $10, but $20. Because you made that deal, you can still buy the toy from John for $10. Now you have a $9 profit ($20 minus $10 you payed john minus $1 premium for him to hold it for you). That's known as a ""call option""


What's known as a ""put option"" is the opposite (selling the toy instead of buying). 
You own a toy and you think it's going to go down in price. You make a deal with John that if you pay him $1, you can sell your toy to him for what it's worth right now ($10) whenever you want until next year. 

Let's say the toy is worth $3 now, you can sell the toy to John for the price you agreed on ($10), and profit $6 ($10 minus the $3 for the toy, and the $1 premium).

381,AMC," Note that the following does not work for AMC but for GME due to the insane short interest. For AMC it accounts to a certain extend, but the unique position of GME appears due to it being shorted over 100%. So even if you want to cover every short it's physically impossible because so many shares don't exist. The only way is borrowing shares but you can't reserve shares.

And keep in mind, it's very unlikely they can buy all (all meaning not the 140% or the remaining 121%, but all of their own, as it's most likely split up) at once, meaning if they buy a big portion of stocks it will skyrocket the price and make it even worse for their other shorts. That also means everyone else has to buy on that increasing price and usually its just some major capitals invested in it (in such a game) and they wouldn't allow the other just to buy stocks and make it worse for the others. They work together and instead sell around in between them to lower stock price, but as long as people hold this has no effect (as in, yes it will bounce down, but go back up again).

Note: This gets even worse in puts since every put is worth 100 shares needed. These are options which expire today, which will force the person holding the options to exercise them. Or rather, it's exercised for them. That means if they have a put on 10$ and now it's on e.g. 200$, then they have to pay...I don't even know how puts are calculated since they have their own value. But it's a heck ton.

Shorts on the other hand do not run out.

388,A," But why would they buy it an invest?

Its a bad investment. Yes you can bankrupt the short sellers and ut some compedition out of business. But most people at some point often look for a retrun on their investment.

I don't know much about the USA specifics since I am UK but currently there is a lot of similar things going on around the world in the retail sector. The entire industry / sector is completely unstable. People simply do not shop in the malls and shopping centers any more. Why would they? You can buy the item on the internet and it turns up 24-48 hours later and often its cheaper. Covid mostly has actually just massivly accelerated this process.

Even for more major items. Like I walked into a TV shop to try to actually buy a TV... They didn't have any in stock of any of the TV's I would have accepted. Their answer was ""We can order it for you and it would be here in 2 weeks"". No as a customer that is not acceptable since I can order it myself and it would be with me in 2 days and the whole process would be faster, cheaper.

So if you simply buy / invest into a failing market sector. The sector is still going to be failing. The people won't actually get a return on their investment. Yes it would prop GME up for a while longer but ultimatly its still going to fail in a business model. Look at it from a different perspective... What services do gamestop actually offer than other places don't.

Also I have a completly different take on the entire thing. I don't see anything that has happened with GME anything but a pump and dump. What I actually see is the people who think they are currently doing the manipulation are actally the manipulated. Effectivly somebody came up with a good back story and played on people emotions (hate the rich). I think the following happened

1. Identification of a creditable backstory (Mervin was spotted to have a large amount of shorts)
2. A few key people buy as much GME as they can afford (You can see this before the story hit)
3. Let the story out... Play the people tell them they can bankrupt mervin.
4. People really buy into the story based on emtion and irrational decision making. Cause there has beena  real narrative of ""hate the rich"" being pushed the last few years.

Its a bad investment. Yes you can bankrupt the short sellers and ut some compedition out of business. But most people at some point often look for a retrun on their investment.

I don't know much about the USA specifics since I am UK but currently there is a lot of similar things going on around the world in the retail sector. The entire industry / sector is completely unstable. People simply do not shop in the malls and shopping centers any more. Why would they? You can buy the item on the internet and it turns up 24-48 hours later and often its cheaper. Covid mostly has actually just massivly accelerated this process.

Even for more major items. Like I walked into a TV shop to try to actually buy a TV... They didn't have any in stock of any of the TV's I would have accepted. Their answer was ""We can order it for you and it would be here in 2 weeks"". No as a customer that is not acceptable since I can order it myself and it would be with me in 2 days and the whole process would be faster, cheaper.

So if you simply buy / invest into a failing market sector. The sector is still going to be failing. The people won't actually get a return on their investment. Yes it would prop GME up for a while longer but ultimatly its still going to fail in a business model. Look at it from a different perspective... What services do gamestop actually offer than other places don't.

Also I have a completly different take on the entire thing. I don't see anything that has happened with GME anything but a pump and dump. What I actually see is the people who think they are currently doing the manipulation are actally the manipulated. Effectivly somebody came up with a good back story and played on people emotions (hate the rich). I think the following happened

1. Identification of a creditable backstory (Mervin was spotted to have a large amount of shorts)
2. A few key people buy as much GME as they can afford (You can see this before the story hit)
3. Let the story out... Play the people tell them they can bankrupt mervin.
4. People really buy into the story based on emtion and irrational decision making. Cause there has beena  real narrative of ""hate the rich"" being pushed the last few years.

400,ALL," SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD UPVOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD HOLD HOLD! DONT GET PAPER HANDS DURING THE LAST HOUR, ITS WHAT THEY WANT!

407,DD," Yes. Once the shorts have covered upward pressure stops. 

This trade works both ways. The shorts are in a crowded theater with a small exit right now and are all rushing for the door driving the price up.

Same principle on the way down. If you hold for the peak then the script flips and the longs are in a crowded theater with a small exit. Everyone rushes for the door at once. 

The other thing to consider is once it starts to descend there are not going to be a bunch of buyers in the higher levels. Once people realize it is tanking and the squeeze is over the price can descend at a crazy rapid pace until there are buyers. 

This is actually the piece that the media has right about it being dangerous for retail. If you do not recognize how the exit on this trade happens you can go from 400+ to 14 dollars very quickly. 

This is not advice purely educational. Do your own DD plan your exit. I pulled the trigger on my sell orders too quickly and left money on the table. ( I also bought in early December so my cost was lower) but I am also out safely and don’t run the risk of being caught in the collapse.

It’s essentially a game of prisoners dilemma. Too much profit taking ends the squeeze but no profit taking and you could just watch your position implode with no exit in site

418,GME, So the hedge funds borrowed the ability to purchase millions of shares of a stock like GME back when it was maybe $10 or so with the plan that they sell those shares immediately and then repay the borrower when the price of those shares drops. Of course their entire strategy relies on the prices of GME becoming lower than whatever they had purchased it for. Now if that price never happens they still have to pay back the person they borrowed the stocks from and the only way to do that is by buying the stock are whatever price it currently sits at.

435,GME," What I don't get about this idea is it ignores that shorts don't have an expiration like options do (at least to my understanding). Hedge funds shorting the stock pay interest on the shares they've borrowed based on the current price of the stock. These hedge funds can afford to pay high interest. It sucks, but they've got money. And paying interest is a lot cheaper than actually buying the $500 stocks to cover the short. 

In the meantime, they might make some money themselves on this squeeze and cover their shorts once the price drops dramatically. I imagine that various brokers halting GME purchases yesterday contributed significantly to the price drop. Some of those shorts might have been covered at a \[relatively\] low cost yesterday.

Evidently they were able to short 140% of outstanding shares so I see no reason why they can't keep open a new short position or keep their current short positions.

456,GME," >shorts don't have an expiration like options do (at least to my understanding). Hedge funds shorting the stock pay interest on the shares they've borrowed based on the current price of the stock. These hedge funds can afford to pay high interest. It sucks, but they've got money. And paying interest is a lot cheaper than actually buying the $500 stocks to cover the short.

>In the meantime, they might make some money themselves on this squeeze and cover their shorts once the price drops dramatically. I imagine that various brokers halting GME purchases yesterday contributed significantly to the price drop. Some of those shorts might have been covered at a \[relatively\] low cost yesterday.

>As the saying goes, ""the market can stay irrational longer than one can stay solvent."" But hedge funds have the money to stay solvent for a LONG time. Lord knows they're taking advantage of this situation in some kind of way. I don't think it's the David v Goliath scenario that it has been made out to be.

468,PS," I think you cannot go wrong with boring tech stock like Apple and Microsoft. App stores and subscriptions bring in a lot of money and haven't reached their full potential.

Not as boring; I just increased position in TSMC since it's currently dipping, probably because Samsung announced it's planning to start producing chips themselves. However, it will take Samsung time to build factories and start producing, TSMC is way ahead, so I think TSMC will be fine. TSMC is currently at full capacity and expanding.

Sony is also going through a dip, they're now in between console generations. I think they'll recover when PS5 is more widely available and the numbers come in. People are ready for a new console because the PS4 is 7 years old. PlayStation is Sony's cash cow and all PS consoles have been a success.

528,BB," Pure speculation with almost no fundamental DD outside of EPS and analyst ratings but I bought some GM right before the afternoon dip (love that). I think their 2035 all EV move could end up doing well in the longer term, especially since I don’t see Biden’s Fleet change (whatever that means) being Tesla’s or Mustang SUVs. 

Something else that could be promising is eBay - they’re cutting out PayPal and doing all transactions in-house - I don’t have the exact numbers off the top of my head but basically their fees will go up around 2.9% while net seller fees will go down (if you factor in the 3.4% PayPal fee). So by the end of 2021 their top line revenue will be increasing by a proportional amount no matter the volume now that the middleman (PayPal) is cut out. Of course the actual amount will probably be lower than the total fee increase if they have to pay credit card/Apple Pay fees - however they wouldn’t be making the switch if they didn’t see it as a profitable move. Of course we be in a tech bubble and who knows if it’ll be a good long position.

659,GME," The clearing houses take on the counterparty risk. Even though we do everything on the computer, trading is not instantaneous and why a settlement date is still a thing. When you put in an order to buy a stock, it's funnelled through the exchange and someone on the other end will say sure I'll fill that, but they might not actually have the stock, especially if they are a market maker. This is ensure the market is liquid, and they will work to make sure all the books balance out in time to make delivery. When balancing the books, on some transactions they will make a few ticks others lose a few ticks, normally a non-issue, prices don't fluctuate that much throughout the day. However there is a chance the other party might not have the stock, in which case they default (fail to deliver). The clearing house takes on this default risk and will buy stock at current market prices to ensure delivery. 

When it comes to this week with GME, there was a lot of frantic buying, finite number of shares and huge price volatility. The risk of delivery failures became large, according to WSB we aren't selling, and with the huge prices swings the house doesn't know if they will be paying $150 or $450 on your $300 order if the otherside defaults. To hedge against counterparty risk, they need to have a certain level of capital on hand so they are liquid enough to fulfill all orders placed on the platform. As volatility and probability of default increase, the capital requirements will increase.

This is why platforms put the restrictions on buying certain stocks, to protect themselves from large potential loses if delivery failures occurred. However, this created an inefficient market which still continues today.",conspiracyshittank,2,/r/stocks/comments/l7fmk6/eli5_gamestop_retail_investor_buy_restriction/gla6yeh/,0.084,0.761,0.155,0.973

[WSB will not allow me to post since I’m less than 45days old on their sub. If you think this makes sense, please feel free to repost]

I love you all and this group. And I still hold a large proportion of my GME and AMC positions. That said, I do want to call out that the short squeeze we were all expecting may now not materialize. Here’s why:

There were 50M trades today. Retail investors couldn’t buy much due to restrictions. So very likely that majority of the buys were done by short sellers covering their position. Total short was around 60M as of Jan 15. Assuming they accounted for 80% of the buys today, that’s 40M positions closed. Only 20M shorts likely left, if that. High enough - but not enough for the kind of squeeze projected. Daily trading volumes are 100M - 200M and these shorts can easily cover their positions without moving the price much in these volumes.

Does that mean the price won’t go up? No - the price can still move if enough people buy. But at that point, it’ll be no different than a pump and dump - we will just be taking money from a fellow retard who’ll be left holding the bag. Not from the hedge funds who’ve likely already exited their positions.

This is all theory. I hope I’m proven wrong and the hedge funds were fools to short even more. I don’t think they’d want to play with fire again after getting burnt though.

Welcome your thoughts. But please don’t pile on without rationally thinking through this. A lot of people’s money is at stake here.

PS: I intend to hold the GME and AMC positions I have right through the end of this (wherever we end up). For me, this was as much or more about the cause as the money. And so, I’m prepared to lose the money as well if it so happens.

686,OR," I learned today that there exists a such thing as a clearing firm (ie. the clearing firm behind WeBull who restricted WeBull's gme transactions).

Why does buying/selling a stock need two different entities in the middle?

When I first started investing, I was very annoyed by the fact that I have to go through a middle man a.k.a the broker.

In physical goods market, such as when buying a clothing, if I want to buy a Nike product, I can directly go to Nike website to order OR go through a middle man such as Amazon to buy Nike product. I did not get why I can't just directly go buy a stock like that.

However, if I think differently, it kinda makes sense because Nike's job is to sell their product so they spend time setting up their website and stuff to sell directly. However, companies' job is not to sell stocks so it'd be inefficient for them to set things up but rather just delegate to a middle man (broker) to do the job.

However, now that I realized there is one more middle man (clearing firm), I'm now not getting why stock market needs two different entities rather than just having one entity dealing the whole flow of buying and selling.

Is that just the legacy of old way or is that actually something that has to stay that way even in the future? (To elaborate what I mean: How things are done change over time when people realize the old way is inefficient and new technology/knowledge can be used to do things in a more efficient way. I'm wondering if having two middle man is actually how things have to be done or is just an old way that is legacy but should be changed to a more efficient way now/future.)",whiteSkar,8,/r/stocks/comments/l7mzx9/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_jan/gl7tipc/,0.013,0.943,0.044,0.8459

693,GME," Man, WSB -- usually a weird place anyway -- has become downright unlivable.  Unless you're screaming HODL Diamond HAnds! at the top of your voice, you get downvoted into oblivion.  It's tulip mania over there, with everyone convinced that the price *has* to keep going up.

Here's what I don't get, if someone on here could answer it for me:

What is the exit strategy for these guys?  At some point, the price *will* come down.  I'm not saying that the price crashes today or next week -- but it will, at some point, come back down to reality. Eventually, either the short interest all gets covered, some hedge funds go bankrupt and simply skip out on their obligations, WSB loses interest in this and people pull their money either because they are bored or they want the cash, and/or the regulators intervene and put a stop to it (whatever that looks like). In any event, it's safe to say that GME does not stay at ~$300 in perpetuity.

Meanwhile, the only way this works is if people continue to buy -- and the reality is they are paying ~$300 for share in a company that has a non-sustainable model and is on a slow, inevitable march to bankruptcy and a stock price of $0.

So a bunch of people are going to be left holding the bag. I just don't see how there is a long-term strategy to unwind this without a bunch of people, from retailers to hedge funds, taking the hit.

What's your idea about GME and r/wallstreetbets? Many people in there are motivated like crazy, everyone says hold and they think it can go up to 10k-20k. There are some serious screenshots of losses but still, everyone says hold.

Could these massive amounts of loss screenshots be fake and make people just lose money? I don’t think so, but...

Why GME pumped up like crazy while it's just a normal company?

Right now I’m in loss of ~£1000 in my strategy (fake money, trial, no real money) account. This started to concern me because I wouldn’t be happy if this was my real money.

795,UWMC," Fundamental comments below. Cup and handle question: Could a cup and handle apply to a company going through a SPAC merger and is a 1yr chart long enough to identify? I've seen criticism of using short term charts. Looking at the UWMC 1yr chart, it looks like the end of the handle right now, but is the recent merger a variable that would negate looking for something like this?

Edit: merger is complete. This WAS a spac and listed as UWMC on 1/22

On fundamentals: UWMC reports earnings next week. [UWMC is the number one wholesale lender and sitting on cash from the merger](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210121005895/en/United-Wholesale-Mortgage-LLC-and-Gores-Holdings-IV-Inc.-Announce-Closing-of-Business-Combination) and Ishbia.

On volume: We all know [the refi boom continues](http://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/consumer_rates/960651.aspx) but UWM is strong on purchases, even offering a [10 day appraisal guarantee](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/uwm-will-partially-refund-borrowers-for-late-appraisals/)

Catalyst for increase: upcoming earnings will be juiced by the [IPO pricing incentive](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.housingwire.com/articles/uwm-offering-61-bps-on-conventional-loans-through-march-8/amp/)

804,CEO," I learned the hard way awhile back that as long as Tim Cook is CEO, Apple stock is going to fall after every earnings statement.

It doesn't matter how good the earnings statement is, Apple always drops afterwards.  Apple could report a 1 trillion dollar quarterly earnings, and Apple would still drop like a rock afterwards.

Why?  Because Tim Cook refuses to give guidance on the next quarter.  He likes to play things conservatively, and he probably worries that if he gives expectations and Apple doesn't meet it, their stock could drop by 25-50%

So instead Tim Cook gives out awesome earnings statements, but stays silent on guidance for the next quarter.  Wall Street hates that, and as a result Apple stock always falls after an earnings statement is released.

Tim Cook has made the the decision that he would rather not give guidance and cause a 5-10% dip, rather than give guidance and run the risk of a 50% dip if Apple doesn't meet their targets.

So my strategy for Apple is to immediately short the stock a day before the earnings statement comes out, wait for the stock to tank over a week or two, and then buy more on the dip.",platon20,6,/r/stocks/comments/l7mzx9/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_jan/gl969vk/,0.075,0.887,0.038,-0.6747

813,GME," Its not so much about the company or how well its doing. Its now about taking advantage of a unique situation. The reason it is thought that this stock will continue to rise over the coming days is the fact that all those who shorted it (originally over 90% of the shares held were shorted) have to buy back in to cover at some point. The remaining shares have been bought up by WSB and other investors and many are holding or even buying more. So, essentially, there's very little opportunity for those big shorts to buy back in unless they pay more, and when they do so... guess what? The share price just continues to rise each time. So its a massive snowball effect. Yes someone will get burned and left holding the bag ar some point, its kind of about how greedy people are going to be and timing the exit right.

To add fuel to the fire, other big investors are still piling money into GME. Justin Sun for example is planning to buy $10 million worth of shares when the Asia markets open (https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1355163433700745220?s=19)

895,IMO," Anybody who follows Apple knows that a dip always happens after earnings release.  EVERY SINGLE TIME.  

Doesn't matter how good the earnings report is either.  Always a dip.

The reason for this is Wall Street doesn't like the fact that Tim Cook won't provide guidance on the next quarter.  Since he refuses to provide them with this info, it causes the street to ""lose confidence"" that Apple can continue their record gains.

It's quite absurd IMO.  If Apple came out next quarter showing it to be the first company in history with a trillion dollar revenue quarter, the stop would drop 5% because Tim Cook refuses to speculate on the next quarter.

So I recommend that everybody short Apple stock a day or so before the next earnings statement and the cover your short over the next few days as Apple takes a 5% dip.

941,GME," The reason it is thought that this stock will continue to rise over the coming days is the fact that all the big traders who shorted this stock have to buy back in to cover their short positions at some point. Over 90% of all $GME shares at the start of all this were shorted.

~Quick Guide to Shorting Stocks~

1) An investor borrows a security (stock) and sells it on the open market, planning to buy it back later for less money.

2) Short sellers bet on, and profit from, a drop in a security's price. This can be contrasted with long investors who want the price to go up.

3) Short selling is high risk, high reward. If the security happened to go up in price and not down, then the short sellers can no longer profit by buying back in, instead they have to buy in at a higher price therefore losing a lot of money, or they may trigger a margin call on their broker account.

4) Margin Call happens once you reach a certain threshold with your broker account. The broker will perform a margin call, and if you don't deposit more funds or if the price moves further against you, then the trade will automatically close and you'll be left with 2-3% of the account's original value.

Back to $GME - much of the remaining 10% or so shares were bought up by retail investors like those on WSB, plus other investors, who are all holding onto their shares and even buying more. So, essentially, there's very little opportunity for those short investors to buy back in unless they want to lose money. And even if they do buy in, it causes the share price to actually rise even further. So they are all locked into this massive snowball effect.

Now, someone WILL get burned and left holding the bag at some point, it just depends on how early people sell their positions and how quickly it all moves. But basically Wall Street traders are locked into this, and the price is only increasing. It closed today far higher than it did yesterday, and it's thought that it will really take off early next week.

To add fuel to the fire and what makes WSB so confident is that other big investors are still piling money into GME. Justin Sun for example was planning to buy $10 million worth of shares when the Asia markets opened: https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1355163433700745220?s=19

1. Shorts who are really effin' screwed right now
2. The (huge) institutional investors who have bought to supply/foment the squeeze
3. Retail investors who might account for a fraction of a fraction of (2)

The people who win when (not if) GME comes crashing down are (1) and (2). The former wins because they cut their losses or will be bailed out; the latter because they'll be the ones driving the sell-off (at prices higher, sometimes much higher, than they bought). Retailers lose because they will have bought high and sold low.

$900 - $300 = $600 profit.  Now, take out like 25% for short term tax gains (less than a year) = $150.  So your 1 share got you $450 in net profit, and that assumes the GME stock TRIPLED in value.",majorchamp,3,/r/stocks/comments/l7zr2y/jan29_gme_discussion_thread/glapf0g/,0.0,0.723,0.277,0.9571
984,GME," it could go to $1000, it could go to $10.  

Basically, stocks can be shorted which just means someone expects the price to fall and they make money off it falling.  hedge funds have spent millions, billions on betting Game Stop will go down...so much, they bet 140% of the floated shares will be shorted.  That is 40% more than what should be the max and even then 100% is ridiculous.  

So what has happened here is the community came together to keep the price from falling, which forces the shorts to lose money and thus not make money because their price targets are never reached. They have lost $70 billion in a matter of days because of this. and it will be over $100 by today IMHO.  Maybe $120b. 

IF the shorts cover their position, which means they have to pay out at the current stock price of $300 or whatever it is, it will close out their short position but at a Massive loss and it will cause the stock price to rise. 

IF a bunch of people started selling GME, the stock price will slowly fall, making it easier for the shorts to recover their money or at least lessen the damage. 

but nobody knows wtf is going to happen, because we don't know what elite forces will start getting involved (SEC, govt officials, etc..) or what bailouts will happen.  That is why if you want to buy it...I'd buy a couple shares if you can afford it and just hope it goes up.  and assume it will go down and you will lose the money.  

It's gambling, plain and simple.  Gamble what you are willing to be fine losing. 

As of right now, something like 100% of the shares are STILL shorted, which means...they have NOT been covering, which means they are still bleeding a fuck ton of money.",majorchamp,4,/r/stocks/comments/l7zr2y/jan29_gme_discussion_thread/glaon47/,0.105,0.829,0.066,-0.9052

As a result, they demanded much higher collateral to offset the risk.

Thing is, brokerage firms cannot use customer funds to pay this collateral, it's against the law. They have to use their own money to do it. A lot of brokerages looked at these stocks and decided that allowing people to buy would impair their cash flow too much, so they suspended trading on these stocks.

Realistically I don’t see Melvin shorting more than 10% of the stock. It was probably a few funds/ investors doing it and collectively the shorted more than 100%.

I do have a bad feeling about the way WSB pumped GME. Stock markets are not really made for these targeted buys and holds. Read up on bear raids from the 90s and how they were ruled illegal. This is pretty much the same but in a different direction. I think WSB had a good intention, but then just got infiltrated by people wanting to pump the stock and some other ones saying that they are just here to make a statement.

Point is, this is triggering bubbles everywhere. Now they are pumping Doge (coin) which is not shorted by anyone, and does not harm Wall Street at all.

1047,AMD," Simply because something is mentioned a lot does not make it into a meme, and I suppose that also depends on your definition of a meme stock.

IMO: Meme stock/crypto is anything with a lot of hype that goes up in price sololy based on demand and not the value of the thing you're holding.

Example: AMD. I've been long based in research in the market, the company, the competition and it rewarded me. Sure it was mentioned a few times but it wasn't a meme. There is actual value here with items you can purchase and items that power servers.

1048,NOW," Simply because something is mentioned a lot does not make it into a meme, and I suppose that also depends on your definition of a meme stock.

IMO: Meme stock/crypto is anything with a lot of hype that goes up in price sololy based on demand and not the value of the thing you're holding.

Example: AMD. I've been long based in research in the market, the company, the competition and it rewarded me. Sure it was mentioned a few times but it wasn't a meme. There is actual value here with items you can purchase and items that power servers.

That's just one guy's opinion, but one who is ""in the industry"". Streaming is doing damage to theaters, [exclusive release windows](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/28/amc-strikes-historic-deal-with-universal-shortening-number-of-days-films-need-to-run-in-theaters-before-going-digital.html) are dropping, and the ""hype"" is video on demand. There is a bit of convenience to staying at home to watch something (No overpriced concessions! You can pause for bathroom breaks!) and home televisions are much, much better than they used to be at the height of the strip mall peak era (all complete with new, shiny cinemas of course) in the early 1990s. So it is very possible cinema will have to reform even more around offering a total experience (more Alamo Drafthouse-ish than what they were before).

That being said, people will be going out more after coronavirus plays out. Maybe the cinema is one of those destinations. if you want to put a little bit in cinema, AMC previously was not the greatest one to play outside the memes due to a lousy balance sheet (although [the memesters are helping here](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amc-entertainment-to-issue-444-million-shares-as-investors-opt-to-convert-600-million-of-convertible-debt-2021-01-28) so we'll see what happens).

1179,DD," Eu investor here. I am invested long in RR on the LSE. The reason why I took it over other listings is the fact that I believe that the Pound as been really weak at this time (granted: Brexit + Covid). I expect, and this is my personal belief, the pound to recover in the next few years. Therefore amplifying my profits if/when I decided to sell or re-balance my portfolio.

On another note, I don't expect Rolls-Royce to go bankrupt (although is always a possibility) due to their involvement and importance to British economy, the government won't let that easily happen (but nothing is guaranteed). Also, RR is making changes (energy, defense,etc), its evolving, so expect a very turbulent (pun intended)  year at least. It is my personal belief that it will get worse before it gets better. In any case, I keep buying dips and playing for the long game.

Everyone is expecting a recover from travel at some point in the future, although airline companies need to sell tickets to create revenue, RR does not. It does not matter to RR if the plane is full or if it has only 1 passenger. What matters is that those engines are rolling. Therefore I expect a quicker initial bump on RR when air-travel starts putting planes in the air. And the to trade sideways until planes are getting full and more are needed in the air and bumping it some more - unlike airlines, which will see revenues growing with number of tickets in a more smooth linear way.

1182,DD," Ok, I am going to answer you from memory cause I am on my phone and out for the weekend. You should definitely research this, the Rolls Royce website has information on this matter.

There are many forces driving this, but I assure you that the market (almost) always corrects itself instantly for any arbitrage. Hence is usually really hard to take advantage of this.

Each stock has different rights and that is explained on their website. Therefore they are valued differently (voting rights, etc).

I also remember that in 2007 1Pound was roughly 1.6 € I think. Therefore the stock should automatically be 60% higher when in €. 

Other thing is volume, bid-ask spreads and liquidity... RR LSE is the most liquid if I am not mistaken. 

Then there is the dividend that has different rules for each stock (if I remember correctly) . On LSE I can chose to receive money, I can chose to receive RR stocks or I can receive a different, low tier stock if I want too (all explained in their website) 

I read a lot about this, but I don't remember all the specifics and some details might be a little fuzzy... but at the end of the day I went with RR.LSE and I am trusting my previous DD CD

and with consideration to the current climate, it's prudent to look for opportunities in stocks with abnormal short interest, but which are fundamentally good stocks. These provide secure price floors while offering upside opportunity.

The majority of GME's movement has been due to high volume call option purchases and gamma squeezes, not short squeezes. The short interest has remained astronomically high, and additional short positions have been opened throughout the past several weeks. Markets predominantly move based on forward thinking (anticipation). 

A volume/float ratio of 33x is a positive indicator for this trade. When making speculations of this nature, the ideal entry is during a high volume/float ratio, not a small one. A small ratio indicates increased price action, which means most traders have already arrived to the party. 

You don't require a proverbial ""squeeze"" for high short interest companies to move. If the climate dictates substantial risk, which it does, and the underlying company indicates positive growth, which it does, it becomes asymmetrically risky to maintain a short position. 

Regardless of these ideas, it's likely that over the next few weeks, we'll see a large influx of retail traders seeking out anything with an abnormal short interest, and this drives price action.",thirtydelta,5,/r/stocks/comments/l7yg4u/when_short_sellers_are_wrong_opportunities_with/gl9m6s8/,0.019,0.772,0.209,0.9938

1264,SI," I'm getting conflicting answers on what happened today when it dipped 

Some said that yes the MMs did close their naked shorts and then others say that SI % float is still 129% or 98% or something and that they still have not been squeezed if its 98% then I would assume that yes they did close a portion today.

Of course when short sellers close the price goes up, which made sense assuming they closed at $113 > causing stock to go back up 

And as you said what stops them from doing this tomorrow well it just depends on volume. I think they were able to do it today because of the dirty stuff they pulled with multiple stock halts and telling brokers to not sell anymore so whether they do something similar tomorrow is definitely interesting to see how they would do it.

It was weird how it went up like crazy AH which didn't make sense cos most volume and retail investors are low during that time and so you would think the big dogs want it to go low, but its kinda sketch cos possibly they playing both sides as someone was explaining to me essentially hiking the price up AH by putting in calls but once its hiked they sell new shorts > next day market open they start their scare tactics as they been doing > driving the price down allowing them to close those new shorts > now they put in new calls to spike it AH and do it all over which really does kinda make sense in regards to what happened.",mateyman,1,/r/stocks/comments/l7ldq3/quick_question_about_calls_that_need_to_be/gl7i9kt/,0.056,0.893,0.051,-0.3612

1302,AAPL," I posted this in /r/options, but I'll post this here for those wondering.

 Here's why this was a great day to buy NASDAQ/Tech.

First, I hope you're familiar with the concept of max-pain, and today is the essence of max-pain trying to kill off every written option to maximize returns.

For example, this is a [list of FB calls expiring today](https://ibb.co/YWBKzFk), nearly 57,000 options with rights on 5.7m shares. Every last call owner until 250 will be massacred today, a good thing if you wrote 275 (covered or naked) calls a few weeks ago instead of buying them.

Then here is the [same story with FB puts](https://ibb.co/8zgsFgs), with nearly 40,000 of them being massacred out in the open. The max pain area for FB for the day will be between 250 and 257, the lower it goes, you should pick up any option expiring next month or later.

The story is the same for AAPL, AMD, and MSFT where everyone is getting slaughtered regardless of their position's side. For AAPL the max pain area seems to be $130 to $131, AMD's is $87-$88, and anything above $88C or below $87P is well butchered. MSFT's max pain is around $230 to $235, anything above $235C and below $230P is wrecked. Again, puts will be up today, there is no doubt about it given the market bleed, but they are only up relative to yesterday.

I can see us trading for the rest of day within those thresholds, and personally, it's a great time to pick up cheap calls for FEB. I welcome all criticism and thoughts... also, not financial advice.

## Free riding violation

**What is it?** While the term ""free riding"" may sound like a pleasant experience, it's anything but. A free riding violation occurs when you buy securities and then pay for that purchase by using the proceeds from a sale of the same securities. This practice violates Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board concerning broker-dealer credit to customers. The following examples illustrate how 2 hypothetical traders (Marty and Trudy) might incur free riding violations.

**Free riding example, Marty:**

* Marty has $0 cash available to trade
* On Monday morning, Marty buys $10,000 of ABC stock
* No payment is received from Marty by Wednesday's settlement date
* On Thursday, Marty sells ABC stock for $10,500 to cover the cost of his purchase

A free riding violation occurs because Marty did not pay for the stock in full prior to selling it.",Artistic_Gap2203,1,/r/stocks/comments/l81222/day_trade_with_unsettled_funds/gla2zqb/,0.148,0.677,0.175,0.5859

GME was the huge opportunity at making crazy money with squeeze potential. It reached a price per share people no longer wanted to to invest despite the squeeze not having happened yet.
