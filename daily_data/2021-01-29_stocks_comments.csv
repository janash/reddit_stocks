0,SP, Are you saying you have a contract expiring 2/5 with SP at $180 that is *currently* worth less than a contract expiring 2/5 with SP at $300? I don't understand your question really.,0.0,0.939,0.061,0.2263
1,GME," Look at the ""Greeks"" I dont know what stock you're looking at but a fun one is GME. Open those up and look have obnoxious the Greeks are.",0.123,0.74,0.137,0.1154
2,TD," TD Ameritrade is a solid broker with good customer service. There aren't really any best stocks for beginners, but ETFs might be a good option if you're looking for relatively low risk and potential for steady gains",0.166,0.612,0.223,0.3845
3,A," Fidelity. I have my 401k right next to my personal investments and ""playground"" account. I also just downloaded their free Active Trader Pro computer software and it's pretty damn good. A little overwhelming but I like it.",0.047,0.679,0.274,0.7938
4,GME," I bought into GME not looking for profit. I’m fine if GME goes to 10 dollars (it won’t, but still). Hedge funds shorted more than the available float. Yahoo finance, S3 partners, and ortex all support this claim. This is about burning their money. I’ll gladly lose 300 bucks if it means the funds lose 30 billion (marketwatch estimate).",0.128,0.755,0.117,-0.1909
5,DD," I completely agree, but tell that to DFV.  Speculation is okay sometimes (if you're willing to take the risk) and I actually allocate a certain % to speculative stocks.  But if you're just joining in, you're riding the hard work of those that got in early and are just trying to make a quick buck which will likely turn out the other way around.  It's so deep into the squeeze at this point, the reality is we have no idea which direction it's going to go or when.    


I guess, the point being if you're joining into a squeeze like this late, then just don't risk what you can't afford to lose.  For future speculation, do your own DD and figure try to make your own risk/reward stocks.  I find it to be academic and when it works out, satisfying.  Just know though, the guys reaping the rewards on GME got in last year and they held.  They were committed to their positions and their intuition.  It doesn't always go right, but in this instance it went REALLY right.",0.023,0.832,0.145,0.9692

7,BB, It is going to happen on Monday. That is when you need to sell. They lowered their interest after blocking people from buying on Thursday. So the stock won't go up 600. It will shoot up to 500 on the open but i would sell in the first hour. By Tuesday the stock will start to have a sell off. On the otherwise BB got shorted today so the stock is on at bargain price.,0.062,0.884,0.055,0.1154
8,AMC," This may not be a popular opinion, but 3mil + new users on WSB and all the media attention, you have to know that there are bots spamming the AMC & GME stocks.  When you read through some of the posts you start seeing similarities in the rhetoric and information that just doesn't add up, or information that is more emotions based and not based in reality.  Some of the information just comes off as conspiracy theories, similar to the campaign of disinformation we saw during the elections.  I think the sub has been bombarded with a pump and dump campaign of some sort.  Imagine, everyone's emotions are high and you keep feeding it to drive up the cost, until one day it just dumps.",0.131,0.869,0.0,-0.9543
