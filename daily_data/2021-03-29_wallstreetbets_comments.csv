Until the pandemic, a sustained negative beta was only hypothetical. Basically, a negative beta means a stocks moves in the opposite direction of the market. If you have a stock with a beta of -0.5, then if the market goes up 10%, the stock can be expected to go down ~5%-ish. Zoom was the first real example of a negative beta stock. While the market crashed in March of 2020, it skyrocketed.

And small gains can be seen as significant losses. Basically, if GME and AMC shoot off to the moon, it's likely that the rest of the market will be collapsing at the same time.

262,AMC," I voted against it only due to the timing. I would love to see a re-vote, leading to a post March 3rd (the original share count date) count. 

I firmly believe that the shorting is now at an astronomical level and that hedges used the March 3rd date as their start date to begin massive manipulation and shorting, knowing the hard cutoff for the count. If AMC would just put out a PR that the share count will be recounted next month, I believe we would see an ungodly amount of short covering to fix the bullshit they've done. 

I know so many people who have doubled, tripled, etc. their position here since March 3rd. I honestly wonder how many public shares we really hold right now.

263,AMC," If you don't have the funds to buy into GME sure... No other reasons to go for AMC instead.

Edit: Oh, got downvoted by the AMC crowd... Here's the long version then. 

AMC has diluted its shares by more than 400% since the begining of the pandemic, they are holding a vote to more than double it again, so let me ask you guys this question, what is a safer bet long term if the hedge funds find a way to prevent a squeeze, GME or AMC? The company that hasn't diluted its shares at all during the pandemic or the one that keeps diluting it to stay afloat when there's a third wave of covid coming with younger people being affected more than ever by the variants? Which of the two has the most potential to renew itself as a business?

Let's take Cinemark for a comparison, it's share price was fairly stable before the pandemic when looking at the 5 years chart, right now they trade at 20$ which is about half its pre-pandemic value. They have a market cap of 2.4B and have 4566 screens to make money from. In comparison AMC has 8218 screens so to keep things proportional that's a 4.3B market cap, they're at 5.1B at the moment, fair enough there's hype around the stock compared to CNK. People are suggeting they should be valued at 20$ or more under normal circumstances, this would double their market cap but it fits with CNK going back to its pre-pandemic value too (let's ignore the fact that AMC's stock was going down in price since January 2017). The elephant in the room? They're most likely going to double the number of shares they have on the market with a vote taking place to issue 500M shares! That's enough to save hedge funds if they shorted the stock over 100% and that's enough to make sure the stock price comes crashing down to recover at the level it's at at the moment... And that's without having done anything to change the business itself to increase it's revenues!

364,GME," That's exactly what I was saying yesterday in another post, they have insider information and all, when we have to wait for it to make the news.

Then I was told that ""nope, it doesn't matter"" , ""it's not true, they didn't make money on it"" 

They knew shit, they bought puts on it, while retail was buying long.  
Sold the assets leading the price down, making money on puts.
Then they bought calls, continuing to make money as the market was recovering.

And it's exactly the same thing that happened to GME Thursday and Wednesday, I'm sure of it.  
But because it's GME, we will know only in weeks, because Market Makers + their media puppets

442,GME," True. A poster was bragging last week about how he knew he would make money on his call options expiring on Friday. I explained to him that the time has passed for options for GME and if he took the 1200 he paid for the option, he would have several tickets to the moon, help the MOASS , and not give money to Hedgie fukers. We know we didn’t reach 250 Friday and now we have a ape holding his hand on his ass out his money. Buy and Hodl is my way. By the way I did buy call options after the dip in Fenbuary with a strike at 47. I paid 1200 for April 16 calls, with plenty of intrinsic and extrinsic value, which I executed already, but the time for those deals have passed.

Don't learn about options with GME. You're not DFV, you're late to the Game.

So you literally could not make that bet right now, probably because almost everyone would if they could lol. I’d honestly recommend buying a few shares, then learning options with less pricey and risky options. You can still decent money off other volatile stocks and their options right now, I just think GME is a brutal learning ground when it’s being so manipulated and swings so much. You would most likely watch it expire at zero.

614,GDP," 🤣 Retail traders are a corrective force on the Fed's inflationary market policy. The Fed is responsible for inflation in the markets since before 2010. They print into the market raising prices while controlling the CPI inflation at 2%, artificially creating wealth through the market. In fact, the rising prevalence of retail traders and the mania in the market is an effect of the policy, along with the COVID relief, both the stimulus and the aid given to companies and banks through lax Fed policies.    

Edit:    
Actually, this is quite similar to the situation in Japan. However, Japan has better tax policies in order to prevent the resulting inequality in addition to cultural differences that frown upon lavish displays of wealth. The US, however, is an independent, individualistic culture, meaning everyone strives for their own wealth... Meaning that equality will come from individuals being industrious and shifting to the market of their own volition in order to capitalize on the opportunity. However, that will see the inflation that's been happening in the market, the inflation the Fed controls and ensures is disconnected from the CPI, flowing into the CPI as retail trading gains more traction.    

In general, the USD is backed by the GDP of the US as opposed to gold and other hard currencies. Which means that every cent is worth a portion of what is produced in the United States, whether it be services (employees) or food made in a diner or exports like crops. Because the United States produces a shit-ton, the USD has become the reserve currency so it his intrinsic value as a means of trade as well. Well, when more money is issued the value of other money is diluted. Though, this can be controlled by various monetary policies that control who gets the money, etc., and generally a healthy rate of inflation (meaning that a part of the GDP, the CPI) of 2% is the target to meet. How does the Fed print and dilute the value of money without inflating the price of bread to thousands of times? They put it into the market instead of giving it to consumers, who would start buying things as they get more money, increasing demand and therefore cost. The market digests the money and ensures that consumers only get enough to keep inflation in check... trickle down economics (filtered down economics). The money goes into growing companies, the wealthy, and perhaps a bit back to the government. Then, the companies try to ensure maximum profit by increasing (or controlling) production to meet demand, ensuring that their work-force is of capable quality and quantity, and growth (which is reflected in the markets).",PM_ME_CLEVER_STUFF,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfoi1w/ok_ok_inflation_is_caused_by_small_traders_ok_well/gsp4069/,0.01,0.848,0.142,0.9948

801,AMRS," Fair observations. The company didn't really turn around until 3Q 2020 - November of last year was the inflection point. 4Q 2020 earnings were an absolute blowout - look at the market reaction. Earnings call transcripts are very telling, I recommend reading them if you have time. They also don't have much in the way of real equity research coverage, so the quality of the estimates is suspect. More to the point - this isn't a business that can be benchmarked on EPS (yet) - it's still an early stage growth company and earnings predictability is challenging, which the company fully acknowledges. I'd personally pay more attention to revenue and EBITDA estimates through 2021 (I expect the company to be EBITDA positive by YE 2021 and EPS positive by YE 2022, but these are just educated guesses)

On my April calls - been accumulating them over the past two weeks or so, and they've been all over the place which is par for the course with this name.

807,AMRS," Partially answered in other responses, but quick summary - the share price was never $500 - the company had to do reverse stock splits. Prior to 3Q 2020, this company had incredibly valuable technology but no sustainable business model. Think of it as a science project but without a real business. This is very common for early stage companies, particularly in frontier technology. Developing new technologies is expensive, and there isn't always an immediately obvious business application. Trial and error has led AMRS to where it is today.

When a company doesn't generate sufficient cash flow to cover its operations, the only way to stay alive is raise new money, diluting existing shareholders. The strategic transactions they will announcing this week validate that they've finally found a business model that is sustainable and generates enough cash that they can operate their business without issuing significant dilutive equity. This is so important. Sure, it is possible, even likely that they will raise some new equity going forwards, many companies do this, but management has confirmed that the days of significant dilution are over thanks to the new transactions (as well as the cash generated from their high-margin consumer brand portfolio)",SubjectDiscipline,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfc86c/amrs_the_ultimate_dd_deep_longterm_value_with/gsphlqk/,0.046,0.83,0.124,0.9573

810,VERY, Extremely dated? That article is from about 2 weeks ago and it's not because they missed earnings it's because they incorrectly reported $12 million more in revenue and $7 million less in losses than actually occurred or about a $20 million swing for a company that was barely pulling in $25 million in revenue last year. Also $880 million is VERY material to a company with this kind of revenue,fed_smoker69420,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfc86c/amrs_the_ultimate_dd_deep_longterm_value_with/gsnigyp/,0.035,0.937,0.028,-0.1365
811,DD," You can’t say hardly any debt it is 2.1 billion dollars. Direct quote from latest 10k

>The Company has incurred operating losses since its inception and expects to continue to incur losses and negative cash flows from operations over the course of at least the next 12 months following the issuance of our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had negative working capital of $16.5 million (compared to negative working capital of $87.5 million as of December 31, 2019), and an accumulated deficit of $2.1 billion.

The report then goes on and says that they have $56 million due this year and if they fail to pay that there will likely be a chain reaction of defaults resulting in liquidation of the company. Read the 10 k if you don’t believe me. 

Not tryna spread FUD or anything I was just thinking of buying in and did a little DD. Still might buy cuz I like the tech and the fact that they have revenue is big but it’s still risky af.

In my experience, usually these hedge fund driven selloffs have a temporary impact on the whole market, which then snap back pretty quickly. There is always a tiny risk of contagion (one fund collapsing brings down another fund, which brings down another, etc) but I view that as pretty remote.

As I said, the Lavvan lawsuit is real, but it’s claims are specific to cannabis, which so far has generated almost zero revenue for AMRS. The chances of AMRS being found liable and paying an $880 million judgement are ZERO. It will likely be settled out of court for a tiny fraction of that amount

The NASDAQ was around 9,576 pre-COVID.  It went to 14,051 ATH.  It is presently 12,995.  The pain we have all felt happened with the NASDAQ not even going down by 10 percent. I personally lost 383,000 dollars of 813,000 dollars profit in the last two months with the NASDAQ declining only about 1000 points.  The NASDAQ could easily drop another 1000-2000 points with a market correction.  This is why I'm largely cash gang right now while the market has switched from easy mode to savage mode.  I have no idea where the lows are, but suffice it to say the market is still really frothy right now given the huge run-ups we have seen the last year.",Sea_Ring971,22,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfm3fg/daily_discussion_thread_for_march_29_2021/gsp98ye/,0.088,0.841,0.07,-0.128

1012,SI," well first of all your broker shouldn't be able to lend out your shares (unless you're using margins).  But lets just assume they do anyway.

A has 1 share, B shorts said share and sells it on the market to C.

B has an open short position while C owns 1 share, so where leaves that A?

Well i believe the moment A's share gets shorted, his postition turns into a type of CFD where he just gets paid the price difference if he were to sell.

Now the broker transfered one share through 3 parties without duplication, there's 1 long position, 1 short position and one debt obligation from the broker to A.

this is how i believe the system should work, clearly with some SI we've seen this isn't always the case.",blutch14,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfluqr/why_the_archegos_story_is_just_the_beginning_with/gspguus/,0.018,0.814,0.167,0.946

Since then they've taken on hundreds of millions of dollars in debt at high interest rates, issued tons of new stock to (hopefully) fund business through 2021, and given themselves tens of millions of bonuses. It's a slowly sinking ship.

1075,GME," You mean the bonuses in their own stock? The class B shares that can't be traded? I love how this ""millions in bonuses"" keep coming up based on a Motley Fool article, lol. Aron actually received a liquid bonus 2/3rds of what he received in 2019, the rest was $15 million in his own stock, which was valued at the time of issuance, the value of that stock fluctuates based on what it is at market. 

&#x200B;

$GME was struggling just as bad during the pandemic and they didn't have to close business. They still had to end up closing almost 700 stores. Look at the $GME price last year, and then look again at the price of $AMC this year.  Here, I'll even link it for you. Look at March 2020.

1144,TD, Yeah Robinhood is admittedly nice looking and easy to buy at market price. But it is a bit uneasy to buy or sell in limits since they don't provide a number of how many bidders and askers there are. So you'd probably be paying a little bit extra per stock at market price. Never tried Vanguard but I may look into it. I'm also very into Penny Stocks that are on TD Ameritrade and Fidelity.

1145,RH," I moved from RH to Vanguard.  Honestly I wouldn't recommend them based on my experience.  First, they won't reimburse the $75 ACAT transfer fee, if this was my only issue then I wouldn't hold that against them. Two, it took a full week to do the transfer, and when it was completed, all my stocks appeared in my account as margin. This was a pain in the ass to get fixed (and was probably Robinhood's fault), the first time I called Vanguard, they told me the transfer should have never gone through the first time and that they were suggesting we reverse the transfer and do it again (I hung up once that was suggested as I didn't want to go another 7 days with my assets frozen).  

I called back later in the day, talked to a different rep, explained my issue and he was able to resolve it (took 24 hrs, finally resolved, no asset transferring needed to be done).

Throughout this process, I wired some money to my account so I could have some capital to trade with (as my previous assets were on hold during the transfer process).  Even though the money cleared my account, it was still put on hold for 7 full days before I could begin using it due to having a new account.

I'm not sure if Fidelity or other brokerages work like this, but it was a lot of work to do something simple.  If you're transferring from RH, please be careful if you're transferring any options.",Bhavin411,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfp1kh/i_was_advised_to_post_this_here_did_not_know_pltr/gsq06cm/,0.04,0.89,0.069,0.6432
1146,RH," When you move assets as ""in-kind"" (which is a typical transfer), you get to keep the shares you bought at your cost basis. Bear in mind that your RH account will be locked for the duration (standard procedure), so you can only buy/sell in your new brokerage account. RH charges a $75 transfer fee, but Fidelity and Vanguard typically (I think) cover it on their end; either way make sure you have $75 ready in your bank account just in case.

The additional issue is that Robinhood is on a backlog of sending brokers your cost-basis (apparently too many people transferred out, so they are behind their work), so your cost basis will be wrong for a while. They are legally obliged to send your broker the correct cost basis in time (up to a month iirc), though.

I believe (someone correct me if I am wrong) however, that the information reported on your tax form 1099 should be correct in the end, but the information on your new brokerage account will be incorrect for a while until RH gets off their asses. It's a small downside for peace of mind though, I think.

You can manually request an update to your cost basis, but afaik you'll have to provide Fidelity and Vanguard with the exact cost of all the shares (each share has a unique ID).",d1nner4lunch,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfp1kh/i_was_advised_to_post_this_here_did_not_know_pltr/gsow5dz/,0.035,0.875,0.09,0.8979

1246,RKT," this is what limit orders are for. 

If you go ahead and setup your ""10% gains"" orders as limit orders (or whatever percentage you're content with), then if it spikes while you're at work, it'll sell it for you, so you don't miss out. I actually did that on RKT today, funny enough. Been sitting on calls for 3 weeks, at -$800 the whole time...today they barely scraped the line of +$250 this morning as I watched it climb and I was like ""Okay, go ahead and setup a limit order, so that if this dings +$500, I can go ahead and get rid of these."" 

Lo-and-behold, while I was focused on work, it just barely pinged +$500 profit. It triggered my limit order, and then 5 minutes later, RKT started heading back down. It happened fast enough that even if I were watching it, I probably wouldn't have gotten the order price picked and setup quickly enough to sell it at that price.

1321,DD," From what I’ve seen the past few days, the consensus in the industry is that UWMC won’t win this fight. I’ve watched countless analysts go on talk shows and give countless reasons. This gives me hope for the same reason you have hope.

I personally think wholesale mortgage will become much more popular IF interest rates rise.

Trends in the industry are having people buy homes for way above asking price.
Supply is going to ramp up and prices will drop to match.
Meanwhile, interest rates may go up. Don’t forget there’s a lot of liquidity floating around ready to be pulled back by banks.

I think if interest rates go up along with supply, then homeowners will be more prone to look for cheaper rates and not be able to put down a lot of cash to get it... in comes wholesale lenders.

They’re also trying to corner the market and make it so that UWM will be the biggest and best wholesaler with strong negotiation power. Quicken is nice and easy but people prefer cheap over easy imo.

Frankly, I don’t think there will be a winner or a loser. Just a bigger gainer. 

Also, rocket is more than just a retail mortgage lender. So, sure, they may do well apart from quicken; but I’ve seen some DD suggesting quicken is their largest income stream (please verify) and if I think that’s where they’re going to get beat out then... 🤷‍♂️",datdernasteroidminer,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfnydm/uwmc/gsp91r7/,0.037,0.811,0.153,0.979

5G tower builders are going to provide an operating system for EV’s? Seems like significantly remote possibility. Hardware providers are now going to start providing software? 

The Android OS is the most likely competitor, but they are open source & struggle with security.

Also, BB bungled their cellphone business under different leadership.

1370,RIG," 1st, thank you for the post.

2nd. RIG was my first ever stock I bought and that was in 2015. I still have it, to today.

3rd. I worked for TSF on a rig, I know them, love them, a great company, clever and a market leader.

4th. Do not forget, they took the beating in the oil collapse in 2016 and the oil and gas industry actually never recovered from that. Then COVID, then this manipulation going on behind the curtains, they fight politicans, corruption and whatever destructive forces is out there and they still survive.

YES, RIG is here to stay and for any individual or any company to break down a company that provides for thousands of families and 100,s of thousands of families from the spin off effect, should just take 3 minutes to think about the hardship they create purely because they cannot accept the fact that they were wrong, they should have believed and rather supported a great company like RIG.

RIG and everyone that is covered in grease and drilling mud, sweating day in and day out to make the SHORTS and HF's fancy cars run, just do it to put bread on the table put kids to school and earn an honest days wages.

1611,SAFE," The SAFE banking act won't change anything about the state line laws. Cannabis still will have to be grown and sold in each state not crossing lines. That's why MSO'S have an advantage. They have a huge head start setting up in each individual state they sell in. Canadian companies have to either buy existing probably smaller MSO'S at a premium or build from the ground up in each individual state. Not saying it can't happen. Just saying it's going to take huge capital to do that. Only 2 I think could afford it and Tilray is not one of them. Constellation owns a big chunk of Canapy Growth so they have the money to grow in the US. The other is Cronos which is backed by Altria (Phillip Morris). Those 2 have the capital. Other than those 2 the 4 major MSO'S ( CURLF , GTBIF , TCNNF , CRLBF) are growing fast. Trulieve will probably end up merging because as you mentioned they are a one state operator. The other 3 are positioned all over the Country. It's complicated but small steps like the SAFE banking act really do help the MSO'S while keeping the Canadian companies from expanding into the US easily.

This usually leads to a dump, but that is also often associated with a decline in the stock price starting several days before the lock-up expiry. ASO has been climbing the last 3 days, so if ER is strong, the price should climb instead.

1644,TC," This is Canada friend. You should be very sceptical of inclimate weather testing. You need serious weather systems to fly in the north with any regularity. Icing would be a big issue to deal with, same with pressure density, and wind shear. It's not simple and I have looked at the drones they have, they need a few huge technical advancements to even come close. If they can only fly in good weather a small airplane is more economical as it can carry much more.

 If it is labeled as an aircraft they will need to change the current rules for aircraft with TC. A government agency who's speed makes geological timeframes look short. Making it an ""aircraft"" isnt a good thing. Anytime a drone crashes, millions will need to be spent on investigations by TC. The drones themselves would require certified aircraft parts making them 1000x the current cost.  They would also require a complete new set of standards for Canadian aircraft.
