0,SO," As someone whose child spent some time in a children’s hospital while ill, THANK YOU. Seriously, thank you to anyone who is doing this. This is going to mean SO much to those kids, many whom can’t get out of bed while they are there. It’s so hard to keep a little one quiet, in bed and calm while they are in the hospital. You guys are amazing!!",MrsG293,119,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mf0msr/gamestop_gear_going_to_the_new_home_at_the/gskwtht/,0.082,0.759,0.16,0.7936
1,GME," These are piling up on me and literally making me cry, I can barely see what I'm typing😭 between these kinda posts helping these poor kids and helping the apes and other endangered animals im so fking flustered. 

THIS COMMUNITY IS SO WHOLESOME!! 

Who knew a bunch of fellow smooth brained apes could do so much good in the world! 🥲 I put every spare penny I have into GME but after it hits the next galaxy cluster and Melvin and shitadel are living in boxes yelling at stop signs on wall street, or once I start seeing significant unrealized gains yall can bet I'll be following in the footsteps of the apes before me. Those whomst blazed the trail of making an impact because lambos are great, but making the world a better place one ape a time is how we can truly die happy knowing we use our wealth for good unlike the leeches on Wall Street. 

I cant donate much rn but ill be picking up trash on the beach weekly so I can hop on this helping train w my tiny contribution. It ain't much, but it'll be honest work. thank you guys for the inspiration. Ape together strong 🥲

2,TV," When I was a YOUNG child, I had to stay in the hospital to get surgery and observation and some tests they told me because I had skin cancer. EVERYTHING about the stay was absolutely terrifying and awful. Everything except one awesome memory. I remember them wheeling in a TV and a N64. I had IV's in and I couldn't even play without making myself feel sick. I remember teaching both my mom and a nurse how to play mario and telling them one step at a time what to do and each of them beating their first ever levels in Mario. I remember it so fondly I'm tearing up now thinking about it. All the memes aside this will make MANY childrens' days and stays much better. I remember the feeling of getting to ""play"" that game in the middle of all the awful more clearly than I remember all the awful now. It has been a long time since then and I am STILL very thankful for the person whoever they were that donated the system to the hospital. I know it was donated because I've been back there and gone through the same office to donate myself. Anyone that does something like this for children in need gets instant great karma in my eyes.

My daughter has had two stays in a children’s hospital.  It is honestly one of the saddest places to be in the world, and I wouldn’t wish a moment in there on my worst enemy.

11,DVD," Had to take both my kids to Choa when they were around 1 month old. They both some some kind of stomach bug and kept spitting up and having diarrhea, which is incredibly dangerous at that age since you can't really give them water, so they had to be hooked up to an IV and we couldn't leave the hospital until they were able to keep a certain amount of formula down over consecutive feedings.

The staff there is beyond amazing, whatever their hiring process is, they really know how to pick the people that truly care about working with and helping children. On top of that, the entire hospital is so cool. They have a DVD and book library with options for kids and adults, a bomb-ass dining area with actual good food, play areas for kids, and beautiful gardens and statues outside for you to walk around in.

He first started working for Julien Robertson who gave him 25 million to start his own fund back in 2001, he averaged 40 percent return until 2008 and was charged with insider trading later.

A symbol perfectly correlates to the market. If you took every single publicly traded stock in existence, and put them all together into a fund, it's beta should be pretty close to 1 (if not exactly at 1)

#Beta > 1

If the Beta is greater than 1, any motion in the market is exceed by the symbol with a beta larger than 1. Market goes up by a 10%, a stock with a beta greater than 1 goes up by more than 10%.

If the beta is exactly zero, it's the Joker of stocks. No predictions will ever hold true, and it will do whatever the fuck it wants. There is no correlation between a stock with a beta of 0, and the rest of the market

#Beta < 0

Until the pandemic, a sustained negative beta was only hypothetical. Basically, a negative beta means a stocks moves in the opposite direction of the market. If you have a stock with a beta of -0.5, then if the market goes up 10%, the stock can be expected to go down ~5%-ish. Zoom was the first real example of a negative beta stock. While the market crashed in March of 2020, it skyrocketed. 

#Extreme negative betas

In the case of GME and AMC, their motion is so strongly inversely correlated with the market, that a small loss in the market can usually be seen as significant gains in GME and AMC. And small gains can be seen as significant losses. Basically, if GME and AMC shoot off to the moon, it's likely that the rest of the market will be collapsing at the same time. Functionally, this week be because hedge funds will be forced to sell all their other positions to cover their shorts of GME, collapsing those position's value.

122,TD," Get a cash advance of all available credit on all your credit cards, talk to friends and family about getting some loans,  next talk to “payday lenders” (super easy to work with),  then talk with your bank about a $25,000 “working capital” line of credit.  Once all that is done open a “margin” account on fidelity or TD Ameritrade (easy interface, perfect for beginners).   Robinhood offers immediate 100% leverage but they’re assholes so don’t even talk to them unless it’s to tell Vlad he’s a crook simp bitch with a stupid haircut. 

If done correctly and under the strict advice of an online gambling forum, you should have anywhere from $5,000 to $50,000 in “dry powder” to begin day trading.  

Beginners should start with iron condors, butterflies and selling naked calls to get a handle on market movements.   Do these for 3-4 days, a week at tops, that should get you ready for day trading TQQQ and Tesla with your entire account.

127,GME," Youre misinterpreting the data. A negative beta simply means that there is an inverse correlation between the market and GME. It says nothing about a causation. Beta is just the covariance between GME and the market divided by GME's own variance. Its a backwards looking value, and you really cannot use it to predict future values without context. 


As for why the beta was so negative; it probably has more to do with GME's initial gigantic rally happening  during a market downturn. That one massive spike in price was probably enough to throw off all beta figures, looking at charts alone. (Im too lazy to run any numbers to calculate statistical significance.) You could make the argument that GME caused that correction with its rally, but I have serious doubts and dont think thats the case. There were other market concerns (speculation with interest rates and treasury yeilds among them) that were shaking overall investors confidence. Unless you can provide some solid evidence otherwise, Occams Razor makes that the most likely scenario. So, no a market upturn does not mean GME is 100% gonna see a downturn (or vice versa)",PM_ME_CATS_420,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mf4qpj/watch_out_for_april/gslv4m9/,0.095,0.826,0.079,-0.036

Edit: Oh, got downvoted by the AMC crowd... Here's the long version then. 

AMC has diluted its shares by more than 400% since the begining of the pandemic, they are holding a vote to more than double it again, so let me ask you guys this question, what is a safer bet long term if the hedge funds find a way to prevent a squeeze, GME or AMC? The company that hasn't diluted its shares at all during the pandemic or the one that keeps diluting it to stay afloat when there's a third wave of covid coming with younger people being affected more than ever by the variants? Which of the two has the most potential to renew itself as a business?

Let's take Cinemark for a comparison, it's share price was fairly stable before the pandemic when looking at the 5 years chart, right now they trade at 20$ which is about half its pre-pandemic value. They have a market cap of 2.4B and have 4566 screens to make money from. In comparison AMC has 8218 screens so to keep things proportional that's a 4.3B market cap, they're at 5.1B at the moment, fair enough there's hype around the stock compared to CNK. People are suggeting they should be valued at 20$ or more under normal circumstances, this would double their market cap but it fits with CNK going back to its pre-pandemic value too (let's ignore the fact that AMC's stock was going down in price since January 2017). The elephant in the room? They're most likely going to double the number of shares they have on the market with a vote taking place to issue 500M shares!

We place our money and trust with the change we want to see in the world, from that money the company can pull from to achieve their (our) goals. 

Although it seems we've already given AMC an endless supply of money from which they have not served us well with over the years, we are now at the crossroads. More often than not I enter trades at crossroads. It's where I'm most comfortable that exponential gains will happen.

So, it's very much just a race between the shorts, the shareholders, and theatre reopenings and the plethora of blockbuster movies coming out this year (and the enthusiasm related to the stock because of those factors) that I feel this is still a sound investment.

225,GME," My broker doesn't even allow for option trading, but I'd like to understand them. Can someone explain the workings behind a $350 call with 4/23 expiry, 3 buys @ $17.53 as in this post? I assume that if the value of GME goes above $350 at any point between now and 4/23 you get 300 (3\*100) shares for a price of 3\*100\*$17.53? Is there any benefit in it going further up in value, or would you exercise the second it hits that price or above? 

Next, let's say it never hits that price. I guess you still have to pay 3\*100\*$17.53, but you don't get any shares.

247,GME," True. A poster was bragging last week about how he knew he would make money on his call options expiring on Friday. I explained to him that the time has passed for options for GME and if he took the 1200 he paid for the option, he would have several tickets to the moon, help the MOASS , and not give money to Hedgie fukers. We know we didn’t reach 250 Friday and now we have a ape holding his hand on his ass out his money. Buy and Hodl is my way. By the way I did buy call options after the dip in Fenbuary with a strike at 47. I paid 1200 for April 16 calls, with plenty of intrinsic and extrinsic value, which I executed already, but the time for those deals have passed.

248,GME," You need to check out the actual option chain. You are saying you’d basically want to bet 5.00 on a 220 contract. They’re going for 10.00+ right now. So you literally could not make that bet right now, probably because almost everyone would if they could lol. I’d honestly recommend buying a few shares, then learning options with less pricey and risky options. You can still decent money off other volatile stocks and their options right now, I just think GME is a brutal learning ground when it’s being so manipulated and swings so much. You would most likely watch it expire at zero.

275,USA," get your tin hats on boys.  he sounds like he could be of Chinese origin?  he's deliberately sabotaging the US on behalf of the motherland!!1!1

ok so i'm mostly joking but... am i?  we already know winnie the pooh asked Chinese-Americans to buy up all the PPE they could find and send it to the motherland before China let the rest of the world know about coronavirus.  i do not put it past them to deliberately sabotage competing nations like this

imagine you're china.  you're kind of sick of everything being back by the dollar and by the US throwing it's tremendous weight around.  you've been buying up gold and working on your own commie-creeptoe which you'll eventually issue out to citizens (as long as they're loyal to the party).  What's stopping you doing things that are massively leveraged against US assets and either (a) profiting massively, or (b) *fucking* up the system?  what do you care if you make the wrong bet one day and end up owing $10tn when you then turn round and go ""lol sorry USA today is the day we rug-pull geopolitics.  we're the big dog now""

the dollar is fucked long term either way, so once you've got your replacement plan in place, why not do everything you can to either profit or tank the competitor?",nolitteringplease346,-2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfi0dt/bill_hwangs_firm_just_went_tits_up_prime_brokers/gso3j3j/,0.07,0.82,0.11,0.8445

They knew shit, they bought puts on it, while retail was buying long.  
Sold the assets leading the price down, making money on puts.
Then they bought calls, continuing to make money as the market was recovering.

371,OR," Yes, basically. In theory. Remember the shorts are able to artificially increase supply though which allows them to dilute the shares. If they cannot drive the price down enough(using whatever means they can, even illegal/unethical) then they end up making the problem worse. Shorters lose when the price goes up. When people come in to buy the price guys up(demand)... shorters do not actually increase supply though except through FUD. What happens if people don't fall for their bluff.

&#x200B;

E.g., No different than in poker with a guy with a pair of 2's and goes all in trying to bluff and gets called on it and loses everything. That is what has happened unless the shorters can somehow fabricate enough FUD to drive people out, but if you know they are bluffing then how will they drive you out? (now, if people start selling to take profit they end up helping the shorts and that could end up creating a problem, but if there are enough buyers they will just come in and buy up the stock knowing they are going to bank in the end).

It all comes down to how long the shorters can keep this up vs the buyers. If the shorters have more money they can keep playing this came and eventually drive the price down enough to either cover(possibly at a loss but not terrible but they probably hedged enough to make a profit) OR the buyers have enough money to keep buying the shorts bullshit and once the shorts can't continue the stock will moon and all the money the shorts put in is now taken by the buyers.

394,GME," Although the short interest is much much lower, I am seeing cyclical patterns in OPEN charts and shorting pattern from iborrowdesk similar to what I've been seeing with GME. I believe that someone is cycling FTDs on OPEN similarly to GME. I believe shorts have been unsuccessfully trying to drop the price since the recent IPO. This is mostly speculation but it looks to me that they tactically covered a significant portion of their shorts in February (probably at a loss) allowing the price to spike before reshorting heavily on earnings (3/4) and again recently after letting the price recover a bit. The shape of the graph reminds me of gme in late January (connect the OPEN earnings tank to when they turned off the GME buy button) just before the panic selling set it and we plummeted to $50. I believe that the next week will be telling in OPENs ticker price whether the stockholders are holding or if the short tactics are working and there is a sell off. 

With the added pressure on manipulative short sellers from the new DTCC rules I wouldn't be surprised if someone (probably a smaller fish as I only saw <3% SI) got caught out while in a red short position and cycling OPEN FTDs, possibly over leveraged.

421,ALL," A housing shortage and a seller's market aren't necessarily the same thing.

In a seller's market, a seller can make a killing (houses get offers incredibly fast and as there are many offers, the bid is usually much higher than what the seller is asking for).

In a given market where there's a shortage in housing, that means that there is literally not enough housing for people to buy.  I could name 15-20 real estate markets in the US that have housing shortages with pre-qualified buyers but nothing in their price range.  When there's not enough housing for too many buyers, the bubble forms.  These are all incredibly hot - top real estate markets that we do business in (please read, we do business in all markets but no one wants to do business in the middle of Iowa (no offense Iowans)).

So how is this different?  In a housing shortage, the only way to get more houses on the market is to build them.  No ibuyer sells new houses - those are ALL sold by the builder in retail fashion.  The people that sell houses for builders are not real estate agents but they are employees of the builder.",Jb1210a,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mf6jig/cathie_woods_ark_purchased_more_than_1_million/gsmnglr/,0.088,0.899,0.013,-0.8997

Now it looks like Muddywaters or his friends have been shorting Archegos levered long positions causing a massive margin call. Blowing up Archegos and creating massive risk for Goldman, Morgan, prime brokers. Also suspect Cathie is being targeted by shorts since Muddywaters announced his synthetic short on ARKK in a podcast.

682,AMC," This is the pure confirmation bias and it's going to ruin people! The initial squeeze caught the institutions off guard, but that hasn't happened since and has only had increasingly smaller gamma squeezes as retail investors wise up to these BS Qmeme stocks that have burned so many emotional investors by talking about going to the moon and lambos. 

AMC has been diluted multiple times since the pandemic to just keep them out of bankruptcy with the fundamental share price in the low single digits with some analysis calling it a PENNY STOCK!! On top of that, it is about to be DILUTED AGAIN to the tune of 500,000,000 shares! A company doesn't just vote on increasing their shares by 100% unless they are in a truly dire situation.

This stock was tanking all last week and was below $9 a share because it's a trash stock thats share price will be cut in half when they dilute it. The only reason it popped up at all and the only reason anyone is talking about it now is because it had a dead cat bounce that didn't even take it as high as the previous peak, let alone the first! AMC will continue to drill until dilution and then and only then will it truly have a chance to rebound, but this is a long term play. Think 5+ years and that is assuming it doesn't go belly up. 

Stay the fuck away from this stock if you like your money and this is coming from someone who made money off the first two peaks as I was holding calls. This is not the same entry as before. This is not a younger GME. GME can pivot and has strong fundamentals.

684,AMC," You must not understand the massive built up demand for going out to the movies after this year. 

Yes you can stream movies at home but it’s going to cost $30. Wtf would I spend that for at home ( I just wait till Redbox has it for $2 ) if I’m going to spend 30 then I might as well go see it on the big screen.

Besides some of the people in this echo chamber, retail has showed it is over these plays. Sure, they have their own threads now, but everytime they are mentioned in the discussion threads they are downvoted to hell because nobody care/ they already got burned an know better. 

The largest investor group in AMC made the decision to lose money by limiting their exposure to their own company.

The shares have been so heavily diluted since Covid that even if demand returns, which it hasn't because most states are still only allowing partial reopening, the price will be a fraction of what it was pre-covid.

Besides some of the people in this echo chamber, retail has showed it is over these plays. Sure, they have their own threads now, but everytime they are mentioned in the discussion threads they are downvoted to hell because nobody care/ they already got burned an know better. 

The largest investor group in AMC made the decision to lose money by limiting their exposure to their own company.

The shares have been so heavily diluted since Covid that even if demand returns, which it hasn't because most states are still only allowing partial reopening, the price will be a fraction of what it was pre-covid.

I’ve watched every panel about the future of IVY from BB Execs, and they are purposefully being vague about everything. One thing I liked a lot though was that after they announced their plan for IVY, they mentioned there was a significant number of OEM’s showed a ton of interest with one OEM asking for a workshop on how IVY is planned, prior to xmas 2020.

Considering how they dominate their market in 19/25 of the major EV producers, I think IVY could be MASSIVE. Obviously nothing is set in stone, but I really think there’s some deep fuckin value here.

814,AMRS," Fair observations. The company didn't really turn around until 3Q 2020 - November of last year was the inflection point. 4Q 2020 earnings were an absolute blowout - look at the market reaction. Earnings call transcripts are very telling, I recommend reading them if you have time. They also don't have much in the way of real equity research coverage, so the quality of the estimates is suspect. More to the point - this isn't a business that can be benchmarked on EPS (yet) - it's still an early stage growth company and earnings predictability is challenging, which the company fully acknowledges. I'd personally pay more attention to revenue and EBITDA estimates through 2021 (I expect the company to be EBITDA positive by YE 2021 and EPS positive by YE 2022, but these are just educated guesses)

On my April calls - been accumulating them over the past two weeks or so, and they've been all over the place which is par for the course with this name.

819,VERY, Extremely dated? That article is from about 2 weeks ago and it's not because they missed earnings it's because they incorrectly reported $12 million more in revenue and $7 million less in losses than actually occurred or about a $20 million swing for a company that was barely pulling in $25 million in revenue last year. Also $880 million is VERY material to a company with this kind of revenue,fed_smoker69420,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfc86c/amrs_the_ultimate_dd_deep_longterm_value_with/gsnigyp/,0.035,0.937,0.028,-0.1365
820,DD," You can’t say hardly any debt it is 2.1 billion dollars. Direct quote from latest 10k

>The Company has incurred operating losses since its inception and expects to continue to incur losses and negative cash flows from operations over the course of at least the next 12 months following the issuance of our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had negative working capital of $16.5 million (compared to negative working capital of $87.5 million as of December 31, 2019), and an accumulated deficit of $2.1 billion.

The report then goes on and says that they have $56 million due this year and if they fail to pay that there will likely be a chain reaction of defaults resulting in liquidation of the company. Read the 10 k if you don’t believe me. 

Not tryna spread FUD or anything I was just thinking of buying in and did a little DD. Still might buy cuz I like the tech and the fact that they have revenue is big but it’s still risky af.

As I said, the Lavvan lawsuit is real, but it’s claims are specific to cannabis, which so far has generated almost zero revenue for AMRS. The chances of AMRS being found liable and paying an $880 million judgement are ZERO. It will likely be settled out of court for a tiny fraction of that amount

Similarly, though I didn't look into it much, I was initially impressed when I heard she was in the coin in 2016 and sold out close to the top. Then I heard she was forced to close out for regulatory reasons. She seems smart but I feel as though she's a better saleswoman. My gut tells me the public style of her focused investments with more or less immediate public disclosure will work really well for her on the upside and turn hard on the downside. The new predictions for tsla seem fairly bonkers. While it's possible she's right it's more of a macro condition thing to bet on imo.

$GME was struggling just as bad during the pandemic and they didn't have to close business. They still had to end up closing almost 700 stores. Look at the $GME price last year, and then look again at the price of $AMC this year.  Here, I'll even link it for you. Look at March 2020.

973,IT," No. In a way it’s the same thing. During the buildup to the housing crisis banks and lenders got too greedy. Loans were cheap and they were giving them out to anyone with a pulse. Once people started defaulting on their loans, the domino effect started and banks and lenders started to go under. Now, again, HF’s got greedy, they shorted this stock into the ground, and it was a dying company, with shit management, and no new plans or outlook. But a big investor comes in, with a whole new vision for this company. He has a vision to turn this dying company into something that could be really huge. But... whats this?

The main reason there is such a great opportunity with United States MSO’s right now is because of the way the markets are structured and they have to trade on the Canadian stock exchanges while the Canadian weed stocks can trade on the American exchanges... its fubar.

And I clearly explained how the US legal marijuana industry could look like New York's. So yes, 99% of people (those who can read) **DO** have an idea of how it's going to play out. 

Also, CAN companies aren't trying to ""take over."" Their best case scenario is thousands and thousands of new stores with shelf space, and open borders. 

Per an MSO themselves (Curaleaf), open borders allow them to open a few manufacturing and production centers so service a massive region of people. Without the vertical integration model, it's very cheap to expand. 

This is what LPs are positioned for. Also if NY is a model for national Legalization, then there will be an unimaginable amount of stores opening across the nation. All will be targets for CAN companies after reform. Much cheaper expansion.

1139,DISCA," I worked in film/tv for ten years on the production end, and I have some in-depth knowledge on the production process. This is good analysis by you, and I wanted to add another perspective.

DISCA is reality tv, which means it is extremely cheap and incredibly popular when it hits. 90 day fiance is a great example of this, but that same show isn’t airing on DISCA. They don’t have the rights back yet to fully stream individual episodes like their other shows, ao they have a workaround of a 90 day fiance channel. This is an issue, but one that should clear up. 

Viacom has lots of scripted television, which means writer’s guild is involved, SAG actors, the works. So while Viacom is spending 2-3 mil for a 1 hour episode of a show, DISCA is spending 200-500k, which is why there is so much content and spinoff possibilities. I think DISCA wins in the next 5 years, since their price point for the app can stay much lower than others since the cost is so cheap for their productions. I made some solid change on DISCA puts when it hit 100 because I had it valued optimistically at 30, and I got puts for which I never do. But that is my perspective on this, since DISCA has such an advantage on price",That_Armenian_Guy,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mf30uw/battle_of_the_fallen_giants_viacomcbs_vs/gsnpava/,0.012,0.856,0.132,0.9795

I am aware that just like any product, Cylance has mixed reviews (I can say the same for Crowdstrike, Windows Defender, SentinelOne, FireEye etc. as well). But one thing I can say for sure, Blackberry and Cylance have an excellent track record, as evidenced by the recent SolarWinds hack where Blackberry has successfully defended all its clients. In my opinion, the integration of Cylance's AI engine in QNX for security enhancement is a welcomed addition, especially as vehicles get connected to the internet and become a hackable surface remotely.

Yeah and I work at a company with actual benefits and makes money. Also I'm 100% positive its more ""highly-selective"".

How did they defend anyone? They didn't upgrade solarwinds? Congrats not hard to not patch your servers.

I've elaborated enough.

The fact the first part of your DD is around ""hypervisor can hypervisor multiple OS"" is dumb. Not really sure what useful hypervisor out there can't hypervisor multiple OS's. Also what car would need multiple different OS types?

The second part is they use Cylance? I'm not sure if your 2 person garage company has ever worked with Cylance, but we implemented it on over 700k servers. It is a shit software, and we quickly replaced it. I'm also not really sure how Cylance is going to work in a car with limited amount of computing and ram..
