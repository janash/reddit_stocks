If a team loses a game, that's it, you lose your ALL money. Once the whistle blows or whatever and the game ends. That's it.

With stocks you can hold for a long time and maybe get back your money, you can average down, set stop losses so you only lose maybe 200 out of 1k investment, set take profits once you're in green etc

There are more ways to mitigate risk than with simple sports gambling.

Pennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

You can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day.

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies.",NPRjunkieDC,119,/r/pennystocks/comments/liyryi/am_i_doing_this_right/gn81o6e/,0.046,0.798,0.156,0.9957

2) Andrew Left published a biased report burning Namaste Technologies $NXTTF $N almost to the ground;

3) $NXTTF received their processing licence so they can manufacture cannabis 2.0 products (edibles); and

4) $NXTTF $N received the TSX's approval to enter the USA market.

If you're telling me that for $30 or $40 I can watch the latest kids crap in the comfort of my own home eating pizza that costs less than movie theatre popcorn instead of paying for two kids and two adults to go sit in a movie theatre only for one of us to get up every 15 minutes to take one to the bathroom or go get refills, you bet your sweet ass I will. Oh, and did I mention that children's movies account for 20% of ticket sales? 

You say that someone is going to dominate in the post pandemic market, and I don't disagree, but why people jump to the amc, the weakest player pre pandemic, as being the one leading the pack coming out of this, I don't know.

238,SOS," I tried posting some dd the other day but for some reason the automods deleted it! Thanks for posting yours and i'ld like to add to if you dont mind!

I'd like to add that SOS LTD is a chinese company. Why would that be important? It is because **China mines 60% of the WORLDS BITCOIN**! So they know a thing or two about bitcoin mining. Those pc mining rigs will be shipped, and they will work great.

They  received their first shipment already, their next two shipments of 5000  mining PCs are scheduled for Mid March and Mid April. Expect news  released each time these are received, and expect operational updates as  they come online. I feel like these news releases will **further create momentum** in the share price and interest many new investors.

They aren't just a crypto mining company, in fact they do a lot more than that.

They generate profits by being a technology company who provides  marketing data, technology, and solutions for emergency rescue services  to corporate and individual members.  It operates SOS cloud emergency  rescue service software as a service  platform that offers basic cloud  products, such as medical rescue, car rescue, financial rescue, and  mutual assistance rescue cards;  cooperative cloud products, including  information rescue center,  intelligent big data, and intelligent  software and hardware; and  information cloud products, such as News  Today and E-Commerce Today. The company serves insurance companies,  financial institutions, medical  institutions, healthcare providers,  auto manufacturers, security  providers, senior living assistance  providers, and other service  providers in the emergency rescue services  industry.  (Pasted from yahoo finance)

Are they broke?

From  this screen shot taking from stockanalyst, you can see that they have a  good balance sheet. They are holding over 50M in cash and have very  little debt.

Volume and momentum:

I  put the volume of each day traded since the beginning of the year onto  Excel and made a graph with trendline. As you can see in the graph, the  trendline is moving up steadily which shows that this stock is gaining  interest and may be breaking out hard anyday now!

Also  we all know that Tesla purchased 1.5B worth of Bitcoin just last week  and will be accepting bitcoin as payment for their cars as well. Bitcoin  is here to stay whether you guys believe or not. whether it was $10,  $1000, or $48000. And as it goes up, these mining companies will be  worth more and more. It isnt going away.

Kevin o leary also shows support for the company. This obviously looks endorsed, but i thought it was cool nonetheless.

239,SOS," They were mainly in the fintech business called China Rapid Finance (Ticker: XRF) in 2017, offering consumer loans/credit. They subsequently pivoted to emergency rescue services after merging with SOS, and changed their ticker symbol to that just last year. I did some digging but its hard to find anything concrete, but found some news about a massive bout of share dilution after the IPO lock up period on Oct 2017 which eventually crashed close to 50% from $100+. They reported terrible earnings throughout the years and coupled with more dilution from offerings which explained the gradual decline in share price.",Aggressivestonk,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/lizedx/sos_will_explode_to_30/gn8drla/,0.07,0.857,0.072,0.0516

That has pretty aggressive growth. I dropped another $1500 in 6 cryptos. That got me another $3000 in the last month. When I first started with penny stocks I decided to use another $1000 that got me $1800 in gains over the last month. I messed around with debit spreads and call options. Using those methods I turned $150 into $1000. Now I’m using options on penny stocks with RH with the same $1000.

GS stated they want to be the biggest name in renewable energy in america. Already started installing massive solar fields.

349,DD," Exactly... basically a reverse merger similar to the 90's dot com craze. The description of the company is not correct and will be updated in time. The marketing company they hired will deal with all this and position CATV properly.

Look at the press releases instead as summarized in my DD.  

I like that they are more focused on pivoting the business and sales and are strategizing on brand positioning instead of hastily updating a description.

Market cap (what’s an ideal market cap 1mil-1bil?)

Outstanding shares (if there are a majority outstanding is that bad?)

Volume (what is a trending volume with say a 500mil market cap company)

Positive there are other factors but would just like an example of what are good indicators to buy in BESIDES the DD on a company?

386,DD," This is also a lite DD about EWLL. It's an incorporation with a company called phzio.com, which is an online physical therapy company that does training remotely. The potential is pretty obvious for even after the pandemic, and this company has some solid software, albeit a pretty small team of about 15 employees, spread out America and Canada. They are fairly active on social media, have a good looking website and seems like a company with some upside IMO. Am I saying it's going to be a winner? No, but I know several people who are using software similar right now with physical therapist to stay healthy, and this is a billion dollar industry. EWLL has some upside in that they have the skeleton of a working software and a catchy name phzio for their app/website. That's pretty much all I got. It got up to .004-5 earlier this week and then dropped all the way down to the low .002's before bouncing back to .0029 for the day. Is this a great company, no, it's a sub penny but I do think it's more like .05-.10 company, and that gives it incredible upside at the current price IMO.

The potential is pretty obvious for even after the pandemic, and this company has some solid software, albeit a pretty small team of about 15 employees, spread out America and Canada. They are fairly active on social media, have a good looking website and seems like a company with some upside IMO. Am I saying it's going to be a winner? No, but I know several people who are using software similar right now with physical therapist to stay healthy, and this is a billion dollar industry. EWLL has some upside in that they have the skeleton of a working software and a catchy name phzio for their app/website. That's pretty much all I got. It got up to .004-5 earlier this week and then dropped all the way down to the low .002's before bouncing back to .0029 for the day. Is this a great company, no, it's a sub penny but I do think it's more like .05-.10 company, and that gives it incredible upside at the current price IMO.

Pros: New CEO is a workhorse. He’s cut operating cash expenses by half. He’s working down their large debt (one of the cons). Even with large debt, they have strong assets leaving 100+ equity. Additionally, they’ve received their GMP certification to move into the EU Market. 

Cons: Shares are already diluted with many warrants outstanding. Large debt, but only a third is short term. 

My hope is that they stay on path to fund annual activities with cash whilst utilizing the large increase in estimated profits for ‘21 to work down liabilities. 

Long hold: 5000 @ .12. Will increase each month so long they stay par for the course.",Hymdol,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/lit3gn/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gn5bo3p/,0.069,0.768,0.163,0.9217

if you don't have $25K you may think about splitting your money into different accounts with one or multiple brokers depending on your frequency of trading. Then you can avoid PDT.

also, there are are brokers outside US who offer you account and you can avoid PDT rule. Because they are not US regulated you need to be careful with opening accounts with them.

4 or more day trades in 5 business days. 

A trade is considered day trade only if it is opened and closed on the same day.

Also, to avoid PDT you can ask your broker to have a cash account instead of margin account. so if you have $10K account you can buy and close as many times you want. 

But there are limitations with cash account. You cannot short at all with cash account and say if you have $10K account you can buy stocks worth upto $10K, your broker won't provide you 1:4 day margin and 1:2 overnight margin. Also,  say if you have made a profit of $2000 after closing a position that additional cash will be available to trade only after T+2 business days when the cash is settled. (date when the position was closed + 2 business days).

&#x200B;

You can check out Yahoo finance, prnews, and Fintel for verification.

441,DD," Not really lol. I've had a few decent ones lately. [TRIP.CN](https://TRIP.CN) went from 20 to 60 cents and I pulled half my profit out, but that one was a longer hold (4 months). I was in some dumb greek shipping company at like 0.005 and it went to 0.01 and I doubled my money and bailed. 

I would focus on quick day/week trade gains, or do some DD/read others on companies with actual earning potential that'll grow over the course of a year or so. I wouldn't straight gamble on a 0.00X and hope it'll hit a dollar. You're better off playing roulette. 

[EAT.CN](https://EAT.CN) I'm quite bullish on. I sat on them at a penny & 2 cents for like a year, and now with good news they're starting to climb and at 4.5 cents.

Pennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

You can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day.

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies.",NPRjunkieDC,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/lixmox/first_week_trading_pennies_up_564627_off_original/gn8yjlz/,0.046,0.798,0.156,0.9957

Pennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

You can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%.

Pennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

You can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day.

592,DD," Yup! Screeners can give you an idea of what to keep an eye on. I like seeing how a particular stock is closing out it’s day and what it’s chart has looked like. Past isn’t predictive but it’s prelude to the next day.

A scanner is something you can use in real-time to see what’s going on. Especially if you are into a scalp trade, you can see what elevator is shooting up and get on and then off after a few floors. You won’t get a 100% gain, but if you’re looking for a couple of percentage points without having to do intensive DD, it’s pretty effective.",AtomicCroce,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/lim912/stock_screener_suggestions/gn46i0u/,0.0,0.851,0.149,0.9505

Definitely a fun lotto with some interesting fundamentals, if they become current and financials show they have the bitcoin they claim, definetly gonna see some extra gain.

- The CEO seems very forthcoming and optimistic with the pending FDA rules for OTC hearing aids, re-claiming good standing and a Fortune 25 partner in the channel.

608,DD," I was in at .0001.....I’ve been watching this for awhile and I’m the one who got the Stocktwits page started there bc I was touting it and people were making fun of me bc it didn’t even have a “Stocktwits page” ...I’m the only one laughing now 🤑.

People have actually thanked me from several different sites bc they made life changing money when they saw me tout it. 

With that said:

 I sold today. 

The reason I sold is I was up so much and too many negative things were coming out. I wanted to secure my winnings (they are in my account officially now) then I’ll decide if I want to get back in later. To be clear. I think this stock hits 12-17 cents and likely peaks around 23-25 cents. But I couldn’t risk if I’m wrong and it drops because each penny it goes down I lose over $10,000.(10%) 

Reasons I sold:

1. Go on their Twitter and scroll down to tweets from 2020 and u will see a lot of mad people. You will also see the same if u go down the Yahoo Finance message board to the 2020 comments. And on investor hub u will find pumpers but u will also see a lot of skeptics. Also on their Twitter from 2020 and 2019  you will see some of these same promises and a lot of pumping. Then large gaps of no communication when the shit hit the fan and investors lost a ton of money. One guy on yahoo was upset he lost ($90,000). 

2. Lawsuits against the family for their business dealings. This is not a good sign when it seems like they are pumping and encouraging their stock price with no shame. 

3. They aren’t current w filings and I know they said March 31 but the SEC is cracking down on this and in a few cases have halted trading on certain OTC stocks not current. I think INND needs to be extremely careful bc what they are doing could lead to some major lawsuits and possible arrest considering a lot of what they are saying is misleading. 

4. They have zero revenue for 2020. They haven’t reported anything bc they were wiped clean by Covid. When they do “legally” file financials people will see that there is nothing there. And INND won’t report ANYTHING to do with real finance until they have pumped this stock to its peak and are forced to show their cards. And I’m not talking about a tweet about “what we might make off this deal” I’m talking about legally binding forms filled out thru the SEC. Not “hopes and dreams” . Also I know they reported a “growth” in income last March (I’ve seen that tweet) but read the actual filing not a tweet and u will see that was a few hundred thousand dollars of “revenue”, INND also had a ton of debt and not enough money to keep the business going, they needed and RS bc their investors fell thru. 

5. They are tweeting some real shady stuff. The Moon Market YouTube video says they are gonna list on NYSE but in reality what INND said was they were going to do business with a company listed on the NYSE. So even the DD here about them up-listing is simply not true. They are also tweeting “OMG this” etc what “multi million dollar company” puts out tweets like this and even misspells (bases instead of “basis”). Even the tweet just now they make their company sound like a pump and dump. They said “buckle up” meaning their stock is going to rocket? They make it seem like it’s some game they are cheering people on to invest bc they seem desperate. 

Now I realize so many people are joining the madness of “what might be” and that will drive the stock. So with that said as long as people are drinking the kool aide I’ll gladly jump back in, but I secured my bag of money no matter what now. I’ll likely re enter and play with about $3000 bucks and see if I can double it. If not I’ll cut my losses if the stock continues to drop but I won’t be losing over $10,000 per penny anymore. 😂

I hope everyone makes money here but be careful and get out w profits. Don’t just “let it ride”. 

BUT They are gonna continue to pump this so as they say “buckle up” but I’ll say be careful to not hold the bag! Someone is holding the bag come end of March Or April.",Forward-Tip-2174,4,/r/pennystocks/comments/likx3k/innd_the_stock_for_short_term_players_and_long/gn42kqc/,0.094,0.807,0.098,0.6569

613,USB," Hypochlorous acid in saline solution is not proprietary, and their Avenova product is available without a prescription, so I see no long-term value here. If they are truly the first to market then MAYBE they will get a jump-start on the competition for a while, but then others will simply copy them and compete them out of business.

Their cleaning product does not impress me either. Once again it is not proprietary, and many other companies are already making and selling their own versions of  hypochlorous acid based cleaners:
