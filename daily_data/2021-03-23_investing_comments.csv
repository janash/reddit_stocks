1,DD," **PLEASE READ: Folks, I appreciate the ad hoc responses to my questions, but my aim is to have OP flesh out this DD.  Please do not post answers to my questions.  Let him figure it out.**

**To those who awarded this post, thank you.**

&#x200B;

>Corsair also has a relatively healthy balance sheet. Over the last several years, Corsair's debt to equity ratio has gotten gradually better, now at roughly 74%.

Some quick questions:

1. Why did their COS & SG&A rise 22% QoQ into Q4 2020, but operating income only rose 18%?
2. What's the $313 million in goodwill on their balance sheet?
3. Why do they suddenly have $121 million in accrued expenses? What are they for? Where are they deferred to?
4. Why did working capital increase for two quarters straight?  Is their supply chain efficiency weakening?

These things may or may not be problems but they have to be picked apart in good DD.  It took less than two minutes looking through their financials to spot them, but there's no commentary in your DD on those or other material changes to their Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

What concerns me is there's not enough scrutiny of their financials but a lot of regurgitation of company earnings call talking points which makes your post read less like due diligence and more like an advertisement.",th3cr1t1c,162,/r/investing/comments/mbfyx6/crsr_dd_a_compelling_growth_story/grxooc2/,0.035,0.806,0.159,0.9847
2,CRSR," Big fan of this stock, bought in a little prematurely at $38 having now seen it dip further, but I’m still really confident in the long term potential . To add to your bullish case, a point which made me very keen to buy in is interestingly the current shortage of computer chips. Over the last year Corsair has benefited from lockdown, and one of the biggest bear cases against it is that the numbers this year have been a fluke due to that. I think this coming year though could also have high numbers though, as many people (myself included) have been holding off building new PCs until GPUs become less hard to get a hold of at a reasonable price. I think once GPUs eventually come back to sensible prices CRSR will have a bumper season selling cases coolers etc for people who have gotten into gaming through lockdown but have been holding off building a gaming rig due to gpu and cpu shortages.",NorthWal,25,/r/investing/comments/mbfyx6/crsr_dd_a_compelling_growth_story/grxolbh/,0.043,0.876,0.081,0.8526

12,CRSR," Great DD. However I think you just convinced me not to buy CRSR or anyone else for that matter. I agree the gaming space is poised for HUGE growth for a long time to come, but I find it hard to justify picking one company as a market leader. Your risk point about brand loyalty is spot on. I personally have a logitech mouse, a CRSR large mouse pad, a steeleseries keyboard and a non ""gaming"" headphone/mic. If I had to pick I'd say I like logitech gear most, but by no means do I have any sort of brand loyalty to anyone, and I can't imagine I'm alone here. Even f CRSR is the market leader they would be sharing that TAM with a dozen other companies all with low margin products. At least when it comes to the consumer goods side of things I think I'ma do an ETF strategy instead. Just seems safer than hooking my wagon to one particular pony in a race this close.

This sounds more mean than I intend it to. This really is good DD and I took it as valuable input. Hopefully I'm wrong and CRSR makes great money for you.

30,PS," I like the company and its products. They're far better quality than Razor's for example. However, I don't see their push towards Streaming as valuable in the long run. Let me explain:

1. First of all, streaming is growing exponentially, but at the same time, streamers that make it big and have some exposure is declining. Their streaming products are quite expensive. A Streamdeck is upwards of $150dlls, which makes me think that a streamer that is just starting out will probably place that cash on a better CPU first. Once a streamer has a steady # of viewers, they'll invest in a StreamDeck, but it's definitely not within their top priorities.
2. Their RAM is of great quality. I may be mistaken but my guess is that it's their biggest profit maker. The thing about RAM though, and I've built a couple of computers, is that it's a product that no one really cares about the brand THAT much. It's not like a CPU or a GPU. You look for the best deal on the RAM speed & quantity you want and go from there.
3. Scuf Gaming - I do believe that SCUF Gaming will bring in additional growth & revenue but like their streaming products, I do believe that they'll hit a sale wall. I'm 30 years old, I love gaming, as long as my Xbox or PS ships with controllers, I'm not going to buy any new ones.

That being said, I like them as a company and I like their growth POTENTIAL. BUT, Since they specialize in ""niche"" products within a segment, I would much prefer owning a bit of Logitech instead. That way, if Esports or Streaming takes a hit, their Consumer-based sales aren't affected and they'll still profit.

39,CPA," >What's the $313 million in goodwill on their balance sheet?

Previous acquisition where the purchase price exceeded the FMV of the net assets acquired? Not super important in terms of valuation, except for maybe an amortization tax shield (I'm not even sure if you can amortize unidentified intangibles for tax purposes either)

>Why do they suddenly have $121 million in accrued expenses? What are they for? Where are they deferred to?

I imagine that's a December month-end expense accrual which, for a retailer during holiday season, I'd imagine would be fairly large. Again, just like goodwill, another accounting convention that doesn't move the valuation needle much beyond NWC changes

I don't disagree with your thesis here, just a CPA pointing out some not-so-important items to dig through in filings. Honestly, I'm of the line of thought Corsair received a non-sustainable earnings uplift from guys like me - I work in a job where I need to move between multiple +10MB excel workbooks without crashing every ten minutes, so I upgraded my home office with a hodgepodge of hardware and peripherals from Microcenter (which I probably won't be replacing soon / putting a ton of wear-and-tear on the hardware since it's looking like we're going back into the office soon)

41,CRSR," >how many PC gamers will build a PC more than once every 5 years

A counter point is how many console gamers will open it up and upgrade parts every few years and keep the same console for 10+ years while still playing the latest greatest games? 

PC gamers do this regularly. And it's cost effective to not have to get new accessories with each new generation of console as well. 

Do you have an raw data or studies showing that console gaming is growing faster than PC? Because all I've seen anywhere is that, up until the card shortage that started a few months ago, PC gaming is taking of in comparison to console.

I'm all for counter arguments, and in fact I'm bearish on CRSR in my gut and don't hold anything.

As you know, goodwill represents the price paid above NAV and specific intangibles - the balance therefore represents what is, in theory, the consideration attributable to future cash flows from that acquisition.

If they get hit with an impairment, and the underlying assets aren’t driving it, then it implies the outlook for that acquisition had negatively changed.

57,USB," They are advertising it like it is fully released and ready to use. It is not. It is in a beta, which ceased to be updated in summer 2020 with no further official announcements about it on their own forum dedicated to the topic. Having to create a support ticket and install an old version of a beta release branch of their drivers in order to use a marketed feature of their product is ridiculous.

What's more, without this incomplete Multipoint feature, each Corsair Slipstream device needs it's own USB dongle. If multiple of these dongles are too close they experience crosstalk, making them useless. This effectively limits the number of peripherals you can use with Corsair Slipstream to 1 unless you have USB ports far enough away from each other.

It's a relatively minor issue in the grand scheme of the company, but it's a big fat res flag staring you in the face. There are angry forum users and Corsair will not own up to their own miscommunication and misrepresentations. I swear there was another larger thread on the forum which was deleted, I remember it clearly because it was talking a out a class action lawsuit. I think it was deleted, and I can't find a backup so I can't prove it of course. Believe that piece of information or not.

Bottom line, I'm the consumer they want.

This is a pretty bad take. Xbox has been one of their strongest growth drivers in 2020 and as someone who follows the gaming industry very closely, Xbox has been gaining serious ground with their games as a service, Gamepass. Gamepass is the premiere gaming service right now, and there really isn't anything remotely close to the value proposition that it offers. It's absolutely massive and a huge selling point to the Xbox brand, and is growing like bananas (i think we're at 18 million subscribers already). Looking at actual console sales is a huge mistake--consoles are often sold at a loss for both Sony and Microsoft. 

On top of all that, recent acquisitions (Bethesda + a bevvy of other studios) as well as the direction that Phil Spencer is taking the company, i'm more bullish on Xbox than ever.

120,LMT," LMT is about 10% of my portfolio and I have high hope for it, but there's really no guaranteed easy money. I initially bought at 370 and keep buying more and more on its way down to 320s, so now I just broke even.

* According to Bloomberg, the defense budget proposal for next yr is flat compared to this year, or slightly down from last year if compared in real term. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/pentagon-crafting-next-budget-close-to-this-year-s-704-billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/pentagon-crafting-next-budget-close-to-this-year-s-704-billion) And the budget might be flat for a while because of the ballooning debt.
* LMT is facing serious pressure in reducing the cost of their F35 program. It still has a lot of issues/flaws to address before entering full-rate production. The full rate production approval had been delayed again and again. While I think it's unlikely that the F35 program will be cancelled altogether, the margins will probably be lower than anticipated because of all these cost reduction measure and all the political pressure.

On the bright side:

* if its acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne is approved, then that'd be a boost to its space division. However, Raytheon and a few other companies are contesting that acquisition. Many analysts are expecting the deal to go through with some conditions, but if you buy LMT, then you need to be aware of this.
* Another bright point is that LMT's backlog is bigger than its current market cap. So there'd still be plenty of work even with the flat budget.

If the F35 full rate production phase is delayed again, or the acquisition is denied, then be prepared for a drop. Overall, I bought it because i think it'd be a great loooong term hold (i'm thinking 5-10 yrs), so I'm ok with the volatility.

On the launch side, ULA (a joint venture with Boeing) will likely lose market share to SpaceX in a big way over the next decade. The Atlas program is contracted for lots of DoD launches, yes, but a recent Space Force launch contract was split 50-50 between SpaceX and ULA. 

On the air-breathing side of their defense business, you’ve got the JSF contract, sure. But the DoD was so thoroughly burned by the cost overruns that it’s literally changing how it builds and designs military aircraft. To stay competitive LMT will need to change its engineering culture from a waterfall model to rapid prototyping. The dog days of cost plus contracts are ending. 

That said, I think they can get some big wins if they make progress on overhauling their culture. I just don’t think it is the rosy picture OP presents.

The two companies boards have also agreed on the terms and currently already have tons of overlap in terms of what they do and they actively work on projects together so the merger would be smoother than most. My money is on it going through. You’re dead on about the F35, costs are astronomical. But the program has 8 international partners and 6 other countries procuring them. Arms sales also serve as a form patronage or tribute towards us as well, meaning they keep buying, we keep protecting. I also was just informed on another comment about an increasingly toxic corporate culture, high turnovers, no promoting from within, hiring unqualified people, and mass charging for work that is not being done. All things on the con side.

But the potential upside if/when another large scale conflict happens, or if they score this merger and position themselves as the leader in space security and defense, is simply too large to ignore. The fact that their financials are rock solid as well tips the scales firmly towards the bullish fro me.",QuentinTarancheetoh,9,/r/investing/comments/mb7dzn/some_dd_on_lockheed_martin_lmt_or_how_to_play/grwflkn/,0.064,0.809,0.127,0.891

TSM was pumped to kingdom come for months, so investing in it at this point is sheer madness. Generally it's a terrible idea to invest in something once it hits the mainstream news (the semiconductor shortage story being a perfect example).

Samsung and the South Korean economy as a whole are highly correlated to China and Japan. Moreover, Samsung is *the* Korean company par excellence that Western investors love to overbuy (because most Western retail investors know next to nothing about other SK companies). As for the index funds and ETFs, they buy Samsung because it's a South Korean blue chip, so it always turns out to be overweighted in their holdings. Most funds and ETFs offering investment in SK seriously overweigh Samsung and a few other major SK companies, which tend to be overvalued as a result.

200,ITP," Hi guys, 

I am 36 and i finally, finally - want to try investing. 

I work good corporate job, but until may be couple of years back the focus has been to get my head above the water. It included emigration, buying a place to live, etc, getting some emergency fund  saved up, etc. Now i feel like i'm ready to invest and have started to educate myself by taking online courses on financial markets, refreshing my memory on economical theory, etc. 

I live in Sweden, my income is circa 50K EUR yearly after tax, whereat health insurance is provided by state, pension as well. 

I have a mortage and owe an apartment. The cost of having this:  is roughly 500 EUR per month  (minus amortization, plus utilities/bills ), on top i amortize the loan 350 EUR per month

I have life/home insurance, circa 25 eur per month

I'm investing 200 EUR monthly in ITP fund (bucket of stocks+bonds following market basically), medium risk, via my bank. 

I'm investing roughly 400 eur monthly into company/my work stock share program. Company adds up 50% on top, but i have maturity 5 years of every investtment made by the company.

I have e-trade account setup by my work to manage stock ownership programme descibed above

&#x200B;

Q:s

Would you reco to contunue with ITPs and diversify a bit or try out to do staff myself, i'm a bit afraid seeing how many things i have to take into account (like taxation, processing fees, etc)

What about day trading, can one make an extra income out of it?

It is a quarterly dividend payment to you from RKT. A company can do two things with profits - reinvest it into the business and pay it out to the company owners. Since you are an owner of the company, that is your share of the profits paid out to owners this quarter. You'll get 3 more this year if you hold the company through 2021.

Did some background checks - most of the operators had worked in similar countries before, or performed similar investments on a project basis (one by one) for some of the existing investors in the Car-Af Agri Fund.

&#x200B;

Fast forward 10 years later, the fund liquidated earlier this year (the original time horizon). NAV per share declined 80% of par value (we invested at call it $1.00 per share, worth $0.20 now). That's NAV (based on their internal estimates), realistically, we are only going to get $0.05 to $0.10 per share.

&#x200B;

Lessons:

&#x200B;

* Agri investing is long term in most developed countries (let alone developing), 10 years is not enough in some cases
*  Meeting operators/finance guys are always great, but the key questions we did not ask/aware of at the time included the following:
   * Hiring plan - if you are to create a commercial farm in developing countries, how are you going to hire X/Y people? If neighboring farms are employing 10-20 people, and you create a gigantic commercial farm, you need to hire 50-100 people - at a reasonable market rate - and get them to move away from their families 
   * Who are the LOCAL managers? Operators are great, but the guys we met had run big projects, how are they going to execute if they live in London/South Africa/USA/Lagos with a farm in Ghana? Are they going there every week?
   * How are products going to get from Point A to Point B? What is Point B? Can we process the raw products? Are they ready for export? Are they for domestic consumption? Are we selling to a wholesaler? Are we selling direct to retail? What are our pricing terms to them? Is it annual? 
* A whole host of other shit I can't write atm - but basically, agri is tough enough in developed markets (technical expertise etc) or at least it is for me, let alone in fringe markets.

There are better ways to get exposure to this than rely on the underlying.

226,MC," >  I am really considering learning Monte Carlo model that Ark Invest is using to produce these numbers.

MC isn't complicated nor does it provide some sort of high insight.  It's simply a statistical tool that utilizes repeated random samplings of variables to construct a probability distribution.  In this case the variables would be various growth/volatility figures and the distribution would typically be a bell curve (other curves can be used) of expected returns/outcomes.

The secret sauce isn't in running the math, it's in determining the variables with which to start.",MasterCookSwag,9,/r/investing/comments/mbh8pc/never_underestimate_the_man_who_overestimates/gry0oyh/,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
227,MC," MC is just a statistical simulation method, you wouldn't ""include"" competition per se.  You would first start with several cashflow scenarios, build the various impacts of market segmentation, competition, overall EV growth, whatever in to those scenarios.  Then import the growth results and expected volatility ranges in to a MC engine to calculate probability distributions.  

Think of it this way, in very simple terms I can build an asset spread report using MC that will show me my expected portfolio value over time.  I'd throw in something like 7% market growth, 15% volatility, and $X portfolio value.  And Monte Carlo will spit out a range of expected values over time.  There's some issues here in terms of the tails being wider than reality but bootstrapping or just understanding what MC is doing will fix that.  But that output is only as good as the 7%/15% figures are.  Let's say I do the same thing and assume 30%/0%.  Obviously the output would be nonsensical.  valuation models have a lot more than just one variable included, but conceptually this is the same, and you wouldn't necessarily be including directly something like a competitor - you'd be reflecting that in your median growth figures.",MasterCookSwag,1,/r/investing/comments/mbh8pc/never_underestimate_the_man_who_overestimates/gryzl2c/,0.0,0.881,0.119,0.962

229,DD," I don't think it's particularly worthwhile to argue over something like this, especially since you don't seem interested in gaining any further understanding of the subject.  But you said: 

> If the plebs do it, it's pump and dump and it's illegal. If they do it, it's visionaries having done well researched DD and showing us how it's done.

And that's really just a completely false statement, DD cannot be a part of market manipulation unless it explicitly contains material false statements about a company that impact the market value.  I feel like I was as straightforward as possible there and you're insisting on arguing that you said something entirely different.  

>What's the real difference between 5 million redditors memeing one stock and 5 million retail investors putting their money in Cathie's hands so she can ""meme"" the stock for them? legally, lots, in practice, potatoes and pota-to-es :)

Neither of these are illegal under any stretch of securities laws.  So again, you're not showing a strong understanding of the law and you're still insisting this narrative exists.  I don't care to argue with you on this any further, you could either take it as an opportunity to learn more about what actually constitutes market manipulation or a ""pump and dump"" - which was the hope of my original comment, or you could just decide to argue over a subject you don't seem to have much knowledge in.
