Phase 3 results coming up Q3 2021.

Management has previously built multiple billion dollar businesses and sold 1 of them to J&J. Management are founders of Remicade, 4th most used drug in the world.

Most of management are not getting paid directly, but instead through rise in equity value (share price increase).

Company was completely under the radar for some time, but is now gaining attention fast!

If you look at the graph, the drop from 11 - 2USD was due to SPAC problems and has nothing to do with the company, the problems are behind them now.

They reorganized in October and took on all the technology associated with their new drug RT-AR001 and the delivery system, market cap ($2.79M) just seems silly low to me for a new first in class cancer drug. Float is also really low.  65mil of 150mil outstanding shares are held by a private biotech firm, and they ain’t selling.  So there’s a limit to what’s available, which makes it spike hard.  They’re prepping for IND application, getting all their patents in place globally, and looking for potential buyout/licensing/partnerships.  

I think a lot of people have been burned before by the past mistakes/mismanagement, which is the only reason I can figure it’s so low.

204,DD," Those are all great points.  From what I’ve seen.  

1. Cash flow.  They recently issued a debenture in January for $500k that matures in January 2022.  So I believe they have enough capital to get them into the 4th quarter.  But cash is definitely a risk with them.  I’f they don’t get acquired by then, I expect them to issue another debenture.  That may change if the stock price is at a level that would make sense to be able to raise real capital.  But nothing points to that.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inspyr-therapeutics-secures-500-000-120000532.html

2.  They have only 1 employee.  The CEO/Jack of all tradesmen. It’s absolutely a skeleton of a team.  Their relationship with Ridgeway Therapeutics was their lab.  By reacquiring the technology and rights from Ridgeway in October of last year, they’re on their own now.  

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inspyr-therapeutics-acquires-novel-immuno-200000477.html

Which is exactly why this feels like they’re setting everything up for a buyout.  They can’t pay for clinical trials/manufacture/distribute this drug.  But the technology and drug has shown promise.  

3.  Where did the money go.  From what I can tell, it seems like that’s being spent on patents.  They’ve been building their portfolio for months now.  And paying for their one employee.  It’s not a lot o money.  So I’m sure it goes quick.

4.  Information is scant.  Absolutely.  I think that’s one of the big reason it’s at the price point it’s at.  It’s taken me more than a month to get comfortable with this stock.  And honestly, I won’t be truly comfortable until I see the QE come out and get to read their year end report.  That’s going to tell me a lot more about where they’ve been and where they are headed.  So I’m a bit uncomfortable right now.  But if it comes out this week (which would be another data point for consistency in PR/keeps them pink current), and the approach is the same as what their recent PR has pointed to, I’ll be able to breathe easier about this investment.

https://microcapdaily.com/rt-ar001-the-rise-of-inspyr-therapeutics-inc-otcmkts-nspx/128157/

In respect to proceeding with caution.  I absolutely agree with you.  There’s a lot of risk right now in this.  It’s just coming out of the dark, not a lot of cash, not a lot of data points for us to analyze.  This is in no way some slam dunk.  

I’m not an advisor.  Do your DD.  Analyze what is available.  Ask folks questions.  I’m still analyzing/finding nuggets of data.",adudereadingthings,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/m50yiq/alright_its_been_two_weeks_lets_see_how_your_10x/gqxuy56/,0.032,0.876,0.092,0.9767

Shares under 0.005 are charged differently but as I have only spend loose change on this types of shares, so far I haven't paid it much attention. If memory serves it's around 1% of the transaction. Not sure if there is a maximum.
