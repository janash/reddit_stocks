0,HRC," Adding to this, my main worries is on commodity prices.

If you look at HRC (Hot Rolled Coil) prices, which are the basis of most steel manufacturing. Plus, the prices of lumber (which yes, they're coming down, but not as much as they should). HRC prices are hitting $1800 a tonne. The guidance for those should be around $900/$1000. We are at above $1000 up to summer next year, which means that steel will remain hot (pun intended) for a long time, causing housing prices to go up with it.

If you can't keep the cost of the material to build a house at bait, there's no other solution but to keep real estate prices. Not until, someone who's over leveraged on it, can't pay the price anymore and fold.

Don't want to be alarmist, but I don't really see an easy solution. Nor many way out.

28,CCS," Two stocks I’m about to add to my portfolio, I’m curious what people think. Not taking huge positions in either, but I like both of them. 

1. CCS. 

Short thesis: CCS has undergone massive growth in sales, profits, and cash flows while currently trading at p/e 7 and ps .8. There is a housing shortage right now, about 5.5 million homes. Wall Street forecasts home builders to do well and forecast this company to continue to grow. I already own Lennar and I’m gonna add a smaller amount of CCS. Stock price is way up over the last year but down 18% the last month. So it’s either a buy the dip or shitty momentum stock, pick one. I’m leaning toward it being a dip since overall momentum is still positive. 

Now, housing demand and prices will either slow down or decrease within the next year or two, I don’t expect crazy growth from CCS forever, but  at p/e 7 and p/s .8, they don’t need insane growth to be undervalued and a good buy. 

2. GRWG

77,IMO," A bit of advice on Crypto:

1. We're still in the midst of a crypto hype/bull cycle. There could be some more rallies, but ultimately I would hold off investing until we see things stabilize at a new floor for a few months and we see new investors (such as yourself, no offense) cooling their jets on crypto markets overall.

2. Don't invest more than you're willing to lose. We still have no idea what the governmental or regulatory future of crypto could entail. It's still prone to manipulation and wild swings caused by single individuals and institutions. Market funds are still significantly safer investments, IMO. 

3. Don't just get into crypto because everyone else is doing it or because it's ""cool"". Have a plan. Hold for a few years. If/when you reach the point of profitability, start to take gainz. Could very well go higher, but it could also go lower. I made a hefty profit selling coins between December and April that I've been holding for 1-3 years. The people buying right now are nuts IMO, although I am certainly thankful they were willing to buy my bags.

I’m not brand new to crypto but am new-ish. I actually bought into BTC and ETH last year when the market crashed, threw my stimulus $ and a bit more of my own that I wasn’t afraid to lose, at it. This last year’s bull run was totally unexpected, the plan going in was to hold for 10 years+. Well it was too hard not to take profit when there was a clear turnaround from 60k to 46k which is when I sold. Still made way more than I’d have dreamed of. However I hate not having exposure to those two coins at least, since we can’t predict how far this sell off will go. My plan was to take stock $ that has made like 75% gain in the last year as well and buy the crypto dip with it over the next few months, dollar cost averaging every couple weeks.

Edit: Were the Microsoft and VOO holdings originally included? If so, my bad I thought the TQQQ and ETFs were the whole thing.

The issue IMO becomes having an entire portfolio devoted to hot theme ETFs and what has worked exceedingly well for a decade+ (3X Nasdaq ETF)  Additionally, last year was a year where these sorts of themes worked spectacularly well to a degree that hasn't been seen since the dot com era.

A ton of new investors came into the market earlier this year and most of them seemed to pile into what worked ridiculously, unsustainably well last year...only to see those things proceed to stop working shortly after. And when ARKK cratered about 30% in a month earlier this year, if you were entirely speculative growth/tech, you did not have a good time.

There was a point last month where 55% of ARKK's shareholder base was at a loss, because 55% of that fund's AUM came after November of last year - after the fund was already up insanely for the year. People performance chased late last year after the fund was already up an insane amount and then in Feb there was a huge rotation out of speculative growth.

Morningstar did an article earlier this year about fund performance after a fund was up over 100% in a year - https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1017292/what-to-expect-from-funds-after-they-gain-100-or-more-in-a-year-trouble-mostly (""What to Expect From Funds After They Gain 100% or More in a Year? Trouble, Mostly"")

I'm not saying no growth by any means, but 3X TQQQ and a bunch of ""hot theme"" ETFs  is not a reasonable portfolio and when that portfolio isn't working, it's going to not work enough that you're going to possibly get shaken out. You're talking about higher risk investments - the entire portfolio is a higher risk investment. 

Again, it's definitely okay to have growth - I don't think young people should be totally conservative, there's a happy medium between allocating to high quality/durable names and more speculative growth - but you have zero buffer for when growth is out of favor. The goal is to find a point where you're satisfied with the risk but a period like March 2020 or what growth had earlier this year isn't going to have you running to hit the sell button or even coming on here to post, ""OMG WHAT IS GOING ON?""

""return chasing? ""

See the above example (more than half of ARKK's AUM came in late last year after the fund was already up well over 100% in a year - and funds being up over 100% in a year is a rare thing, which you can see in the Morningstar article.)

Peter Lynch had unbelievably spectacular returns (and for a long period of time) when he managed Fidelity Magellan, but:

""Peter Lynch, who formerly managed the high-flying Fidelity Magellan Fund from 1977 to 1990, is a legendary investor. Under his management, **the fund averaged an astounding annual return of 29%**. It would seem all you had to do was ride along with Lynch and you would earn phenomenal returns. But that didn't happen. According to Fidelity Investments, **the average Magellan Fund investor lost money during Lynch’s tenure there**. How does this happen? In achieving an average 29% annual return from 1977 to 1990, **Lynch had exceptional years of overperformance and some years of underperformance. For instance, in 1980, the fund had a 70% return. The next year, he underperformed the sector. Investors who hopped on board as the fund was soaring in 1980 may have been disappointed with the fund's performance in 1981, jumping ship to look for another ""market winner."" In doing so, they would have locked in their losses. Had they stayed with the fund for another 10 years, they would have averaged more than a 25% return.**"" (https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2021/06/02/how-investors-are-costing-themselves-money/)

How many people chased Magellan in 1980 and as a result of the excitement over performance had huge positions, making the underperformance in 1981 less easier to tolerate? If they had a more reasonable position, might they have stuck with it?

Additionally, I'm not comparing Ark with Magellan, but Ark's massive money flows not really coming until later in the year after the funds were already up 100%+ for the year is performance chasing. We'll see how the funds do this year and if it underperforms, will be interesting to see how much patience Ark money has before fleeing elsewhere.",dvdmovie1,3,/r/investing/comments/o9geig/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h3cd7ic/,0.047,0.854,0.098,0.9906
85,FA," Robo-advisors are a relatively new concept which is intended to provide a low-cost and low-barrier product to individuals somewhere in-between a mutual fund and SMA (separated managed account). SMA's are managed discretionary accounts which can offer some tax harvesting benefits and support compliance restrictions (ie. if the account holder doesn't want to ever own sin stocks, etc.)  SMA's also have account minimums (normally 100k) and usually slightly higher fees.

The benefit of a robo-advisor is that you may benefit from the same active discretionary management as an SMA but without the higher fees and minimums. 

But the performance is generally dependent on the model manager. SMA accounts usually have a lot of models available to the FA and rebalancing can sometimes be done more often. In a robo-advisor - I suspect that there are less models available and I have no idea how often different products perform rebalancing.",greytoc,1,/r/investing/comments/o9geig/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h3cpv3n/,0.061,0.875,0.064,-0.1308
