0,DD," A bit of DD on this DD - I just want to balance this out: 

Atos is up 25% pre market. It rallied 16.5% yesterday. There was no news to trigger this. 

It's current price is 2.91. That puts it just above it's first support point of 2.61 and just below it's first resistence point of 3.16. 

In terms of its products - they are not close to market. While the covid spray is promising now it has not entered 2nd phase trials yet. Phase three trials could be difficult to do if the vaccines drop the incidence of the disease in the real world. This is a risk.

There is only one stock analysis and it's also bullish, strong buy with a target of $5.00. Insiders haven't sold their positions for a long time. 

So imo:

Pros - it's a real company with a ten year history. 

It's science is pretty strong. 

It has a bit of buzz in the trading news. 

It has an analyst rating with a target of $5.00

Everything op said

Cons - is this information about their products already priced in?

Why is the stock doing so much movement without news?

By the time their product is ready for market, will there be any other nasal products? Will there be a high demand? 

This information isn't meant to sway anyone one way or another but to show the kind of thing I might look at before buying. Is anything fishy going on? Google it.

14,MA," The recent run up is based off of zero news or catalysts.  Running on pure speculation.  I had a position from a month or so ago at $2.34.  Sold yesterday at $2.99, when I saw it pulling back.  With no news to drive volume, the stock doesn't have the power to test new highs.

I think Atossa has potential for a long term hold.  Short term, I fully expect the stock to retrace back around the 200 MA.  Looking to re-enter the stock around the same place I bought the first go around.

49,CTXR," Reading these comments makes me realize how Ill informed people in general are about the medical field. Foley caths are a daily use item in every hospital. Meaning CTXR isnt some crazy company trying to revolutionize some ground breaking idea. They are literally creating a product that if successful will be purchased by just about every hospital across the country and possibly the world. They arent trying to cure cancer or revolutionize cellular medicine. They're trying to create better technology to manage foley caths. Not an insane idea. Like I said every hospital would need one.

""nuRSeS AreNT TrAInEd To AnaLyzE rEseaRCh""  
There's some truth to that. At the same time nurses, especially hospital nurses, can tell you what actually has potential to be a daily use item. Foley caths are a daily use item. If you've ever been close to anyone who works in a hospital you know damn well what a foley cath is and probably hear that term way more than youd like to.  


If anyone isnt qualified to analyze medical research its retail investors. Hospital staff nowadays is so buried under NDAs and HIPPA mainly to keep the general public in the dark.

57,BSN," I’ll chime in, though I’m not sure if this will necessarily be negative. I’m a nurse, and my bedside experience is adult Medical ICU, and pediatric Medical/Solid-Organ Transplant ICU. 

Every unit I’ve ever worked on, and hopefully most units I haven’t, take CLABSIs (Central Line Blood Stream Infections) very seriously. As a result, there’s always at least one staff-driven initiative to track and prevent them (Scrub the Hub, Chlorhexidine Caps, et cetera), along with a lot of staff education. Given all this focus, CLABSIs didn’t happen as often as you may be thinking. My units routinely went several months without one, and there was always at least one unit in the hospital that had gone over a year without one. 

This is just my anecdotal experience, and doesn’t take into account non-critical care areas like dialysis, or complex-care patients being treated in an outpatient setting. I personally like the stock, and anything that prevents sepsis!

Edit: Responding to some of the research comments. BSN degrees require an entire course over research methodologies, and what even constitutes actual research. Most major hospitals either have, or are pursuing, Magnet status, which requires certain benchmarks for nurse-driven research. 

Be careful with your assumptions about other professions. In my experience, there’s a vast gulf between what social media thinks research is, and what it actually is.

A general research methods course often includes medical studies and examples as they are the most common areas for control groups and traditional experimental designs as well as various sampling methodologies.

I'm a health scientist, and I teach a more generalized version of the same course (not nursing, but within a health bachelors program) with fairly similar content to the one my wife took in her BSN, and it just doesn't give the level of expertise where I would feel comfortable with someone making judgments about this type of research.

IMHO, and I can be wrong, you're full of it on this point which you use to bolster everything you say as ""next"" or to give an idea of ""soon""

A quick glance at the Biden/Harris campaign's major promises shows (in order)

* Beat COVID-19
* Jobs and Economic Recovery Plan for Working Families
* Affordable Health Care

""Clean Energy"" and ""Climate Emergency"" are lesser points peppered about (sure, near the top) of 40+ other issues...

[Source being Joe's website](https://joebiden.com/joes-vision/)...

So why do you think ""green new deal,"" a term Biden distanced himself from and instead proposed a similar but different plan ([outlined here](https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/)), comes before health care? And why nuclear before all the other preceding bullet points?

158,DNN," Looking at competitors such as Cameco which are trading at $16 a share today. They have reserves with around 458 million pounds of Uranium in them. Their EPS is at -0.11 due to inefficiencies within their mining process.

DNN is mining nothing and has EPS at -0.02. This is due to capital injections as well as [IP's they hold for cheaper mining processes](https://www.denisonmines.com/news/denison-reports-a-year-of-significant-project-and-122727/). DNN has around 240 million pounds of Uranium in it's reserves.

Based on just reserves and ignoring technological ability, DNN would be evaluated at $8.2 a share if they had access to their deposits today. If we look at EPS growth, they can hit 1.7 EPS due to their tech. This gives us an adusted share price of $14 a share. 

My valuation factors in that Uranium prices are trading just above their lowest point in 10-years at $25/lb.

Given that the Green New Deal (and deals like it globally plan to cut out oil and gas completely) demand very well could reach beyond 2007 levels where Uranium futures traded for +$50/lb.

This doubling in price with no added additional costs could result in a $50 share price for Cameco (historically their share price was $54 in 2007) while DNN could hit $28 a share (2,800% in growth from the current price today). This does not factor in grants and initiatives by the US government where they will help subsidize these endeavors and aid in increasing the cost of shares.",rayrayrex,7,/r/pennystocks/comments/m2cl4v/dnn_nuclear_power_and_the_green_new_deal/gqism32/,0.048,0.816,0.136,0.959

E.g.

1. ""BUILD BACK BETTER: JOE BIDEN’S JOBS AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN FOR WORKING FAMILIES""

Biden is planning on creating a bunch of new jobs through what exactly? 

Well he says so right here:

""Mobilize American ingenuity to build a modern infrastructure and an equitable, clean energy future. We’ve seen the need for a more resilient economy for the long-term, and that means investing in a modern, sustainable infrastructure and sustainable engines of growth —  from roads and bridges, to energy grids and schools, to universal broadband. Biden will soon release updated proposals to meet the climate crisis, build a clean energy economy,  address environmental injustice, and create millions of good-paying union jobs.""

""In a Biden administration, America will lead by example and rally the world to meet our common challenges that no one nation can face on its own, from climate change to nuclear proliferation, from great power aggression to transnational terrorism, from cyberwarfare to mass migration.""

He goes on to mention a leadership summit (which is happening in April) - with the main focus being the climate catastrophe.

3. ""THE BIDEN PLAN TO ENSURE THE FUTURE IS “MADE IN ALL OF AMERICA” BY ALL OF AMERICA’S WORKERS""

Again this is paired with the Biden clean energy and infrastructure plan to accomplish this feat...


4. ""THE BIDEN PLAN FOR A CLEAN ENERGY REVOLUTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE""

Here he notes:

- Biden will make smart infrastructure investments to rebuild the nation and to ensure that our buildings, water, transportation, and energy infrastructure can withstand the impacts of climate change.  Every dollar spent toward rebuilding our roads, bridges, buildings, the electric grid, and our water infrastructure will be used to prevent, reduce, and withstand a changing climate (creating American jobs)
- Rally the rest of the world to meet the threat of climate change. Climate change is a global challenge that requires decisive action from every country around the world (American leadership)
- Vulnerable communities are disproportionately impacted by the climate emergency and pollution. The Biden Administration will take action against fossil fuel companies and other polluters who put profit over people and knowingly harm our environment and poison our communities’ air, land, and water, or conceal information regarding potential environmental and health risks (tackling racial inequality in the US)

Granted this is factoring the testing time for newer models that are being designed and deployed for 2021-2022, that does not necessarily mean all nuclear power plants going forward will take as long as the first iternations of these newer models to construct.

The [CANDU](Bruce Power New build Project Environmental Assessment – Round One Open House (Appendix B2)) for example takes 60 months because it's tried and tested.

What this means is future construction should take place in half the time as all the theoretical stress tests and limits have sufficient bench marks and data for them. As such new plants can spend far less time on R&D and focus moreso on safety testing and feasibility requirements.

2: Literally every DD is speculative unless you are committing an SEC violation. It is literally common sense (which clearly you do not have) that this is a DD and not a prophecy.

3: Biden literally uses the term \[""Green New Deal""\]([https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/](https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/)) on his website: ""Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face."" Why won't you just read for God's sake.

Cool. If a policy is about changing climate, economics and ""other social issues"" it is *a* green new deal. Got it. That is so helpful to be so broad.

Drone delivery is going to be huge in my humble opinion. Company partnered with Air Canada, who is looking to expand its income diversity after what happened 2020-2021. So they have big backers. 

Still a small stock (less then 2 cad) so monke brain over here can by a decent amount of shares for bargain bin prices. 

Share seems to be below a good evaluation, considering that they are still a relatively new company in a very new industry. 

The industry prospects seem to be far more greater than just delivery (ie Amazon and Fedex) but could expand into farming, the oil industry, security sector, recreation, and maybe even flying cars. 

Company has some decent financials (not profitable) but last time I checked they have a few million in cash to keep them afloat. Minimal debt as well (most of it is invested in land or machinery, so dissolvable assets) and the operational costs are minimal.

They just got their first job. And I think they are sending supplies to a remote indigenous community somewhere here in Ontario. 

Stock has grown from 0.88 cad to 1.87 cad over the past few months.

It’s China. I’ve lived there, have been visiting there since I was like 12, and even studied Chinese for several years in high school and uni - so I’m coming from a place of personal experience as a non-Chinese person with some real Chinese experience. 

The government changes pace overnight with decisions made at the speed of light. It’s not like the west, where decisions are made after weeks or months of discussions. 

If the party decides coal is out, coal is out. You’re done. 

If the party decides your mine belongs to them, they’ll determine a valuation and hand you a check and take the keys. That’s it. No conversation. 

If the party decides your mine is no longer considered clean, you can’t mine anymore. You’re done.

269,AUMN," Guys, AUMN is going to be a winner this year, next year, and maybe even the year after that. I own 48,000 shares that I put together over the course of 2020, average price around $0.70. In January it took me to $1.15 before dropping down to mid $0.60s about a week ago on, as far as I can tell, general market panic. That is an insane discount. They transitioned from gold and silver exploration to becoming a producer at the beginning of the year (the jump happened around the same time). 

They’ve got multiple mines in various stages of readiness, but the big two right now are their Rodeo and Velardena mines. They started production at Rodeo in January (probably 15-20 million worth of revenue in the year), and they’re using that to fund the cost of re-starting their Velardena mine, including re-tooling their on site mill for better yields. They will be generating pretty steady as growing cash flow for the next few years at least. Hopefully that buys time for them to finish exploring and then open a mine with tens of millions of ounces of silver already identified in Argentina. If not, they’re still profitable for the foreseeable future. 

Similarly sized companies that are in production cost anywhere between $1.50 to $2.20 but these guys are sitting at $0.69. There’s even relatively worthless miners that cost more! By comparison, Northern Dynasty Minerals (NAK) is priced at $0.72 and they are, at best, decades from ever making money if the sole property they own (Pebble Mine) ever makes it through the red tape of every environmental protection the US can dream up (even Republican don’t like their mine plan). 

Unless you believe gold and silver will not make money in the market of 2021, I think this one is a real gem. I might be biased though because this was my first real DD I ever did way back when I first started tinkering in stocks a WHOLE year ago lol. As always, you do you, this is just my opinion.",broccoli0302,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/m2l134/daily_plays_march_11_2021/gqknndv/,0.037,0.857,0.106,0.975

496,DD," I actually made money on this stock because I threw some fun money at it based on a tip from a friend - went from .02 to .1 (started last summer), looked to accumulate this year (and of course I do my DD on any stock I want to throw serious money into).  Normally DD will show that it isn't a good investment or it is, this time I really felt it was a scam.  I HATE SCAMS.  So after calling and emailing the supposed:

Alternet Systems, Inc. Contact:Randell Torno[**info@lithiumip.com**](mailto:info@lithiumip.com)\+1-800-713-0297

And I got no response - multiple times, multiple people trying to reach this company.  NOTHING.

Go ahead and bash.  I'm here to help, ask me any question you'd like - I have done a LOT of DD.  Time for ALYI to shit of get off the pot.",stopscammers2021,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/m2vhyh/more_proof_alyi_is_all_talk_another_announcement/gqlm5d6/,0.153,0.75,0.097,-0.8771
497,DD," I think [lVlisterquick](https://www.reddit.com/user/lVlisterquick/) meant that [bluecgrove](https://www.reddit.com/user/bluecgrove/) was as bad as ALYI pumpers - correct me if I'm wrong.

But bluecgrove - You'd think differently if my warning save you from losing money.  I'm not bashing - more like exposing.  How about you ask me questions about the company or help me with DD rather than question my integrity - my knowledge on this topic will reveal I am telling the truth.",stopscammers2021,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/m2vhyh/more_proof_alyi_is_all_talk_another_announcement/gqlob68/,0.199,0.67,0.132,-0.671
498,DD," The amount of pumping press releases outweigh the amount of tweets/posts/info to warn people of this company.  I'll do what I can.

If you don't give a crap then why are you replying to my comments?

Not meant as an actual question since I'd rather discuss the company than go back and forth with you about my mission to expose them.  So I wish you well and if you do some DD let me know!",stopscammers2021,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/m2vhyh/more_proof_alyi_is_all_talk_another_announcement/gqlquxk/,0.039,0.861,0.101,0.7034
499,DD," Ok, so here is my DD on lithium miners.

The future of lithium miners are dependent on drilling extraction technology solutions. There are many parts of a successful DE lithium mining operation:

•	⁠Mining Resources
•	⁠Drilling technologie solutions

The drilling technology is responsible for producing 99.9% pure lithium. This is considered Tier 1.

But... there are steps towards making 99.9% lithium industry ready. Testing the end product to make sure battery manufacturers can make industrial sized car batteries etc.

An example of a lithium company that produced 99.9% lithium that passed the testing phase was Lake Resources/Lilac Solutions and Novonix (battery maker) tested the product for approval.",PM_Me_Accounts_rGay,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/m2uwcn/lithium_is_up_huge_today_check_your_portfolio_for/gqlbp6k/,0.0,0.817,0.183,0.9538

503,DD," I think it is a cannabis company that is jumping into the next hot thing. To be honest, they look like one of those companies that re-invents themselves to try to pump the stock up for personal gain. Could have value but buy the dip. I will be honest ABML has the same history. It would take a while with DD to see if it is a long or short play so for now I would treat it as a trade.",ToastTurtle,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/m2uwcn/lithium_is_up_huge_today_check_your_portfolio_for/gqlfg3a/,0.0,0.78,0.22,0.9509

507,ACRX," With ACRX its the opposite. The bearish people are long bulls who are just dissapointed at the management for offering shares to shortsellers at 1.76 when the stock hit 2.94 dollars.

509,CBD," PHBI. I’m honestly not sure how I feel about it, but their focus regarding cannabis is tissue culture starts, and CBD extraction. If legalization occurs and big tobacco starts growing, which I feel they will, companies in the agriculture supply chain will be well posed to benefit.
