0,TV," Stop looking at graphs of stock prices from the past. Historic prices have no correlation to future prices.

Calculate ranges of actual target prices for companies based on metrics that actually matter. Is there sufficient demand for the product being sold? Is the company able to secure the necessary supplies? Can they control costs such that they can deliver products at a profit?

If they’re losing money right now, why are they doing that? How much runway do they have left until they’ll need to do another round of funding? How long will it take them to start generating a profit instead?

If they’re profitable, how profitable? How quickly can they raise those profits? When will they start paying dividends?

If they’re paying dividends, how much? How long can they continue to pay those dividends? Will the dividends go up in the future?

Typical price targets are to have the market cap be 3x annual revenue, or 10-30x profits, or 10-50x dividends.

Typically a discount is applied based on how many years away those future values are, say 10% per year. Come up with a range of values based on today, next year and five years from now.

Take all those numbers to come up with a price target range. Buy companies that are below that price target range. Hold if they’re within it. Sell if they’re above it. Whatever you do, commit to it for at least a year or you’re just gambling. Certainly commit for at least 2 months - no way something material happens more frequently than that.

Use Yahoo Finance. Look at balance sheets and income sheets for the revenue and profit numbers. Look at investor calls for guidance about what companies are doing to improve their processes and how long different initiatives might take.

Edit: The above is what to do if you want to be a professional like Warren Buffet and actually beat the market. With the market so badly beating you, you could do what others say and just put the money in VOO, and bam, you’ll instantly do as well as the market (but no better than it.) Which is better than 60% of professionals who are trying to beat the market. But a lot of those “professionals” are on TV and YouTube and doing what you’re doing - watching past stock prices as if it can tell them anything about the future. Discount those people (the Jim Cramers and whatnot) and only look at the other professionals who are doing stuff like what I said and I’d guess most of them probably beat the market.",ArtOfWarfare,11,/r/RobinHood/comments/122fuan/i_have_never_won_its_been_three_years_and_ive/jdqom39/,0.034,0.877,0.088,0.9533
1,ELF," I have reoccurring buys for VOO and VTI.  I just looked they are both down for one year but look great if you click over to the 5-year tab. I have a set amount that I can easily afford that spend to buy more of each month.  I'm not planning on selling until much later, years from now hopefully.

This is a very boring way to invest, sure.  But even with the way the markets are now (Hands in the air now!  Wheeeee!) I haven't been losing money hand over fist.

Course, now that I am looking at my portfolio, I'm having a hard time not talking myself to go hard into ELF beauty.  I own 3 shares, and that is by far the best performing asset I own.  E.L.F. is a good company.  I use the products myself.  Maybe I should buy more of that...",Annie_Benlen,2,/r/RobinHood/comments/122fuan/i_have_never_won_its_been_three_years_and_ive/jdr5cwo/,0.039,0.699,0.262,0.9913
2,RH, The market is crap this year. I cashed out most of my stocks. RH gives 4% interest in cash. I’m also looking at 9 month CD’s for 2023.,MakingChanges77,2,/r/RobinHood/comments/122fuan/i_have_never_won_its_been_three_years_and_ive/jdrn07m/,0.088,0.811,0.101,0.1027
