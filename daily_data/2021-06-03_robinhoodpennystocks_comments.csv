4,AMC," I'm just guessing based off what I saw with AMC yesterday. Apparently the SEC halts any trade for at least 5 minutes when there's rapid and large fluctuations. Given it shows its up 94% on the day, I'd assume thats why. I know nothing of this stock though and could be 100% wrong. Best of luck, hopefully trade resumes soon for you!",Odinsson69,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/nrc6ax/bctx_halted_pm_reason_code_t1_no_end_time/h0h22rf/,0.045,0.805,0.149,0.7959

15,DD," Actually trying to step away from Reddit to do my own research in companies. Not that I‚Äôm particularly privy to doing it lol. I considered making a DD post for some things but think I want to work on my own capabilities a bit more first.

That said I invite any thoughts or criticisms. But I‚Äôve added some new things to my portfolio 

-	MFA ($4.37) is a real estate investment company with a strong outlook. I landed on this company by looking for which companies were most rated ‚Äúundervalued‚Äù and found it a consistent popup within the real estate sector. They‚Äôve been doing great in recent earning reports too

-	cresy ($6.64) not sure if this is in penny range or if standards have been lowered since feb. this is another real estate management company, with a stronger focus on agriculture/ranching. But they dabble in a lot of stuff in Brazil

It seems like these are both really strong small companies in the real estate and finances game, which are both sectors poised to perform above the sp500 average

Edit

I also moved over ~50% of my VOO into XLF which is a financial sector etf. Also since it‚Äôs expected to perform better than S&P",OurOnlyWayForward,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/nr0150/daily_discussion_thread/h0fc58i/,0.03,0.819,0.151,0.9804
