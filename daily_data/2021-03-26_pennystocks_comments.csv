A) stocks you think will move,
B) stocks you plan to buy,
C) stocks you plan to sell,
D) stocks you are holding long term.

From my experience lately, anyone going in looking to buy a particular stock (instead of at a particular price) is likely going to be in a poor position. It seems like you should be focused on only buying on the red days when people are demoralized in here.

It also seems like (D) is an odd post for this thread, as it isn't a daily move. Like I own a lot of CTXR and see people post it here periodically, but it's not a ""daily play"" until May or whenever we get the results.

So that leaves (A) and (C), and I welcome anyone sharing that they are looking to sell soon (meaning the stock is overvalued).

33,EFF," $RNWR announced another acquisition. It's hovering around .40 today, so I am holding (and buying more) as I think this one is primed to move. 

Bradenton, Florida--(Newsfile Corp. - March 26, 2021) - 808 Renewable Energy Corporation (OTC Pink: RNWR) (""808"" or the ""Company""), today announced that the Company has reached an agreement with CustomsAlley (a reverse-trike vehicle manufacturer) to acquire the majority and controlling interest along with all the I.Ps., composite molds, assembly jigs and all the production EFF (equipment and fixtures) of three reverse-trike models from CustomsAlley. 808 Renewable Energy Corporation will ship all the production assets of these three reverse-trikes from Quebec to a new production facility located in Florida.

As Florida has warmer climate and ample composite material work force locally, it is an ideal place for 808 Renewable Energy Corporation to relocate the reverse-trike operation from Quebec to Florida and combine the existing gyrocopter composite material production operation together to further increase the productivity and increase the profitability. 808 Renewable Energy will roll out its gas engine models first (equipped with a 1200cc motorcycle engine made by the OEM manufacturer of BMW in Chongqing, China), then followed by a series of electric models in the second half year of 2021. The electric models will be equipped with the most advanced dual Hub-Drive Motors (In-Wheel Motors), Dual-Controllers, lithium-ion battery pack (10 kwh). It will qualify the $7,500. Federal Tax Credit for the consumers.

The Company will soon start its international advertising campaign to target the global market with the help of its newly-joined Spokesperson - Lynn Aronberg Capra.",EidoStarFi,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/mdiqno/daily_plays_march_26_2021/gsayyv3/,0.0,0.864,0.136,0.9843

GLOBAL TECH INDUSTRIES GROUP, INC. AND 40 YEAR ART WORLD VETERAN RONALD CAVALIER SIGN LETTER OF INTENT
Mentioned:
GTII
(GTII: OTCQB) Global Tech Industries Group, Inc. (""GTII"" or ""The Company""), www.gtii-us.com, a Nevada Corporation, signed a Letter of Intent (""LOI"") with Ronald Cavalier. Mr. Ronald Cavalier founded Cavalier Galleries Inc. in Stamford, Ct. in 1986 www.cavaliergalleries.com., a world-renowned group of four art galleries, with locations in Greenwich, CT, New York City, Nantucket Island, and Palm Beach, FL. The contemplated collaboration with GTII will allow him the platform to utilize his decades of experience in the art world to bring together the most respected curators and artists, both internationally acclaimed and emerging, to participate in this exciting new marketplace. He is very excited to be part of this new venture to create a Non-fungible Token (""NFT"") www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token marketplace for museum quality curated art. Mr. Cavalier is currently in the process of choosing and further developing a social media platform that will allow him to continue representing his world-class roster of artists in the digital art space where their work will be sold exclusively on the Cavalier platform. The Letter of Intent, the details of which have not yet been publicly disclosed, will give both parties sixty days to perform the necessary mutual due diligence to finalize the details of the new business structure.
The Cavalier Family has a long and distinguished history and connection to the world of fine art. Mr. Cavalier, Sr. was responsible for restoring the sculpture at the Hirschhorn Estate, prior to it being delivered to the Smithsonian Institution's new art museum. Mr. Cavalier developed his passion for art and art collecting at a young age watching his father work, and in 1986, opened his first gallery with the premier exhibition 'Seven Woman Artists'. He followed with many notable exhibitions over the years, which led to the creation of the Cavalier Sculpture Garden, and in 1993 the nationally acclaimed exhibition Stamford Sculpture Walk, a program dedicated to public interaction, education, enrichment and enjoyment. Cavalier's involvement with the Stamford Sculpture Walk culminated in 1999 with the exhibition, 'Important Sculptors of the Late Twentieth Century', which included major works by artists such as Moore, Botero, Smith, Oldenburg, Segal and Nevelson. Over the following two decades, Mr. Cavalier developed relationships with a world-class group of painters, sculptors and photographers. Works by the artists represented by Cavalier Galleries Inc. today, collectively, have either been exhibited at or are in the permanent collections of most major museums in the United States, Europe and Asia.
GTII's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. David Reichman stated, ""This may be the company's most exciting potential partnership and business combination yet. GTII can afford Mr. Cavalier the depth of our understanding of the public market as he moves forward into the digital art space, using the NFT's which we believe are at the forefront of the digital currency industry.""
Ron Cavalier, Founder and President of Cavalier Art Galleries added, ""We are at a historic time in the artworld, as a new artform supporting the collectors' market has emerged. It's a generational opportunity for artists and we are excited to work with GTII to create the platform that will allow them to present their NFTs to world"".

I think otherwise, as health care professionals could face malpractice suits if someone does have a complication that Mino-Lok could have prevented.  I'm bullish on CTXR.

If they can indeed recycle nickel, cobalt, cadmium, lithium (all proven at 96%+) and graphite (think he let that slip but still waiting on those results it only makes sense the company HAS to do well.  Demand for those minerals are only increasing.  The supply is constricted.  This is the CHEAPEST, FASTEST, and GREENEST option of increasing that supply!

 If you go to their website and look through the news releases section there will be 2 that will answer your questions (both from this 2021 year).  One was the initial results and the second results using REAL current EV batteries (2 from tesla models).    The first one is depth so will probably be the one you will be most interested in.

The original work to verify the effectiveness was at a third party lab published around ?6/2020.  It is linked to my original DD a month or two ago regarding the company.

In the interview linked he does mention that the way everyone else does it is DIFFERENT then how they do it.  It is a quick comment so will have to listen careful.

81,DD," They have used their tech on EV batteries and commercial ""regular"" batteries.  If you read the news releases it tells you which ones.  It is 4-5 EV batteries (2 are from tesla) which is what the last NR was about.

Before that they did tests on both EV and commercial grade batteries.  That is the earlier PR this year.  It was a small blurb in the middle of that PR where they stated 99% nickel and cadmium extraction calling it a ""disruption"".   This interview confirmed how big of a deal this will be. 

Think FULL battery results on EV and commercial batteries will be out later this month.  The are running out of time for that so maybe next month.

To be honest, I am not sure why you are so lazy you can't just go to their website and under news releases just look up the 2 PR I keep telling you about??  Why is that? Also the original work was sent out as a PR last year (that one is linked to my original DD as I have mentioned).

Reason its still higher price than CIDM is you said it yourself, So many bagholders since june that bought at $10, all those poor investors are now waiting for it hit 10 again so that they can atleast get their intial investment.

Now I'm trying to figure out what to do with this investment which is looking like a pretty poor mistake. I purchased this stock at 0.16, and it has since halved.  what happens at ""10.11.21""? Does it just expire and i lose the investment if i don't sell it for a loss? through my online brokerage i don't see any way to turn this into a full SHIP holding.

110,SHIPW," So you have a warrant. You will most likely have to call your broker to exercise a warrant. A warrant is the option to buy a share from the company at a given price by a set date. You'll have to look up the issuing information in the SEC filings most likely, or just search around for SHIPW on google or something to see what the exercise price is.",Suspicious__Man,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/mdfnz4/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gsbjybg/,0.0,0.966,0.034,0.296

117,DD," There is no reward. It's a company with no revenue in the OTC world. Who is basing it's product on research and science. Meaning FDA style approval. This would be a 4 year thing. Not to mention they need a product first.. You know how many mushrooms they've grown? 0.  

You know the land they bought to produce their mushrooms on? It was sold to them by a shipping company in Jamaica. The owner of the shipping company is the CEO. The revenue of said shipping company? Also 0. None of his companies are revenue companies they survive purely on share price and dilution. It's why the share structure is atrocious.

My point is if you're DDing and doing 'research' and this is what you find and go with you're doing your research wrong. In OTC world look for things that are wrong before things that are right. If you find things you can't explain that look shady, they likely are. Then you move onto the next one. Always another one around the corner.
