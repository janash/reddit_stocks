1,RH," It wasnt just robinhood. They took the brunt of it, but T.O.S, WEEBULL, and CMEG all restricted buying and created restricted lists. So to blame RH only is to understate the problem.

2,RH," Y'know, I have no particular love for RH, but every broker I've ever been on has been a piece of shit at one time or another.

OptionsHouse used to just go down for no reason.

One time with TDAmeritrade some connection to the NYSE went down, but only one way, so I submitted an order for S&P eminis like 4 times in a row and it *appeared* nothing went through. Nope, it went through. Four times. TDAmeritrade couldn't even figure out what my position was, let alone close it. It took like a fucking hour for me to be able to close this position of unknown size.

I traded with the ninjatrader brokerage (whichever it was, phillip capital?) and their shit would crash too. Sometimes the data would get wonky and update slow during real shit.

Was it cool? No. But well within their ethical right considering it was their own money at risk.

Not even remotely the same situation as deactivating the buy button for a stock people were already holding in the midst of a squeeze.

I can't really make a probable case that Robinhood colluded with Citadel. There certainly appeared to be a conflict of interest. The Clearinghouse raising requirements explanation does make sense.

But they were not properly funded for the level of risk they took on and had to know something like this could happen. Gross negligence at best.",duplicatesnowflake,237,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oxwuiw/it_absolutely_blows_my_mind_that_so_many_people/h7pk46b/,0.105,0.725,0.171,0.9276

233,GME," Cut your losses on SQQQ and don't look at it again, SQQQ is designed to lose value over time even if QQQ trades sideways

for everything else, sell the next time they rally above your cost basis DO NOT SELL NOW.  Then buy then at their next dip.  From now on if you miss a rally, realize you missed it.   Track the stocks that regularly swing bwtween swing highs and lows each quarter and buy them at their lows.   There are easy 20% gains (and I think even 80%) to be had each quarter.

You're where I was a couple quarters ago, I cut losses on 10k$ worth of facebook at 280 and look where it is now.   I did the same with several other stocks, even GME a week before its second pump.

The next quarter I had too high of a cost basis on what I had left and focused on selling everything at break even - turns out I sold a lot of things too early, but I got my money back, and at the end of June I had 80% cash and hadn't lost anything for a couple months (except the failed calls I let ride just in case)

July I bought a tonne of stuff as their swing lows approached..heck today, mvis and sklz both reached the point I've been waiting for for a long time - 12.50 and 13.50.  I'm convinced they will both swing back to 20+.  I have 4200 Palantir at 22.30 and am convinced it'll go back to 27+.   This time ill sell and buy back in at the low.  These stocks swing EVERY QUARTER.. Generally the exact same cycle, before or after their ER.

Now, for the part 6 with consolidated DD:

DD part 6:

Before I talk about Microvast, I have to talk about how Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) came about. It is the only way anyone will truly understand any of the following DD. CATL was founded in 2011, IPO'd in 2018 for $2.1 Billion, and ended that same day at a valuation of $12.3 Billion. Today, it's worth $120 Billion. How did this explosive growth happen with a company where 99% of its revenue was only coming from China? Well, you have to go back before 2011.

CATL was spun off of Amperex Technology in 2011, with Amperex and CATL both being founded by Billionaire Zeng Yuqun. Founded in 1998, Amperex's growth was driven by its ability to manufacture batteries for consumer products (e.g phones, laptops, etc.) based on licenses they acquired from American institutions and companies like Valence Technology. It was such a success and they started producing batteries for top-tier companies like Apple. Eventually, Amperex was bought out by the TDK Corporation in 2005, becoming a subsidy ran by Yuqun.

Then in 2011 CATL was spun off by Yuqun, based on the same exact strategy of purchasing advanced R&D licensing to manufacture superior EV batteries. However, it wasn't without help. They rode the coattails of the CCP's investment of over $60 Billion USD in electrifying China. To be eligible for any of the money on the table, everything had to be domestic, including the battery supply. On the supply side, there was little competition, with large Chinese automotive OEMs deciding to only produce batteries for themselves. CATL filled in the gap, their first big break being with BMW in 2013, eventually, CATL became the largest battery manufacturer in the world, in the world's largest EV market.

Microvast, spinning off a chemical and material science company sold to DOW Chemical, sustained itself in a competitive industry. Unfortunately, it did not have as much success as CATL. Why that is, is for another post but major factors include high internal R&D costs, being too ahead of their time in regards to fast charging, and generally how subsidies were constructed for heavy vehicles in China despite making the most economical sense.

With all of this out of the way, now we can actually talk about Microvast and its latest technology.

But one more thing, it's best that I clear up relevant concepts relating to battery technology. While I expect most here to have a general understanding of how a battery works, I don't expect most to understand the underlying intricacies and nuances relevant but important to understanding battery technology. Below comment on a small fraction of concepts, I have noticed that is poorly understood among retail traders.

1. Battery technology is a multi-criteria optimization problem

No one battery chemistry is perfect for all applications. Typically you are looking at several different characteristics of a battery such as energy density, power density, cost, safety, cycle life, efficiency, internal impedance, etc. Hopefully, you get the point. The end all be all is not energy density. More often than not an improvement in one metric causes a worsening in others. knowing the application at hand is very important. Even across EVs, there's a vast difference in needs when it comes to battery performance requirements.

2. Energy density (or any metric per mass) differs between levels of manufacturing

If you're not specifying energy density by the level of subcomponents, cell, pack, module, or system, in my eyes it is meaningless. Below, courtesy of Löbberding et al. shows the vast difference you can get at the cell level (Blue) and system-level (orange).",DeMayon,76,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oxirt8/mvst_morgan_stanleys_adam_jonas_is_at_it_again/h7muxqz/,0.03,0.832,0.138,0.9975

*""The only reason we went to the public market was to raise enough capital to the orders we currently have in place. We won more business than we have capacity for. And seeing our pipeline going forward, we see that continuing.""*

$MVST will soon see its current FAIR VALUE -- which should be around 10b$ = 30$ SP.

It's not uncommon in public forums to see individuals unknowingly comparing the energy densities of different commercial products at different manufacturing levels. Most battery data is reported at the cell level so any references made in regards to the energy density in this article is the energy density at the cell level.

**3. Not all NMC cathodes are equal**

The term ""NMC"" refers to the nickel, manganese, and cobalt particles embedded in the batteries' layered oxide cathodes. Typically it is followed by three numbers, e.g NMC 532. This signifies the ratio of nickel, manganese, and cobalt respectively, adding to the whole number 10. [More nickel is associated with higher energy density but worse thermal properties and stability. Manganese is crucial for stability, and cobalt is needed for extended cycle life and good charge/discharge rates.](https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/6/1/8/htm) Market needs for increased battery performance and cost demands are forcing manufacturers to increase nickel content and reduce the need for cobalt. Most EVs on the market today are utilizing NMC-333 (or 111), NMC-442, and NMC 532. Next-generation of NMC will continue to lower costs and improve energy density by reducing cobalt and increasing nickel content.

**The role Argonne National Lab Plays**

While all the hype has been centered around solid-state batteries, a lot of progress has been made in less vaporware-like technology. One of those technologies is full concentration gradient (FCG) cathodes. To understand the impact of this we have to go back and learn about the business and technology aspects of NMC in general, and how we got here.

Research work relating to NMC batteries originated all the way back in the 80s, but it wasn't until 2000 that it was in its final form and patented by Argonne National Lab employees: Christopher Johnson, Michael Thackeray, Khalil Amine, and Jaekook Kim. It was a quantum leap in technology that made EV's less of a fantasy. Surprisingly the technology garnered no interest, as no one was licensing this technology from Argonne until 6 years later a small startup called Envia contacted Argonne about this technology. Envia made big claims about revolutionizing the battery industry, targeting car manufacturers like GM. They had a media effect like that of Quantumscape. Millions were invested, but Envia turned out to be a fraudulent venture, with claims of IP theft, misleading ""validated"" data, and exaggerated claims. They were more invested in selling the company at a high valuation than making a viable product. It's a story Quantumscape investors should read as their story is eerily similar to the claims being made against Quantumscape and was not that long ago. It's a story that didn't end well for Envia, with hype in the market they sought an IPO, but their fraudulent claims were exposed soon after. [The exclusive license to NMC technology ended up in the hands of BASF](https://catalysts.basf.com/products-and-industries/battery-materials/licensing-agreements). It is not known how lucrative this has been for Argonne but it definitely has been lucrative for BASF , when they sued Umicore for utilizing it [they alleged they lost out on billions of revenue. ](https://www.greenpatentblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/BASF-complaint.pdf)

The Department of Energy released a report summarizing research from battery makers and Microvast has two different studies published in that report one of which mentions their success in 15 minute battery charging.

They obviously have a Chinese factory becuase they have been making electric buses for China for a decade, but the German factory is done and will be operational before the end of the year. A few months ago they had hundreds of job openings on their website. 

The Tennessee factory is under construction and will be ready mid 2022. The R&D facility in Florida was announced. Both of these claims are easily verified by a quick search. 

From Microvast's own promotional video we can see their electric powered mining equipment. For me this was a huge update becuase if you want an ev revolution you need a shit ton of mining. If you start applying for mining permits and you mention that all your mining equipment is electric its going to be harder for the environmentalist hippies to put up a fight.

315,GM," One of the biggest goals for the R&D Argonne conducted at Argonne labs is to have their research commercialized, for the benefit of society, funding future technology, incentivizing their employees, and essentially paying back taxpayers. After a screening process that involves financial, R&D, and manufacturing capabilities, eligible private entities have the right to first non-exclusively license advanced technology from Argonne during a testing period, before signing exclusive IP agreements for manufacturing purposes.

How this is all relevant to Microvast is because of Argonne's full concentrate gradient technology.

**Microvast's Full Concentration Gradient Cathode**

With NMC cathodes already previously described, in layman terms we can describe what the FCG NMC is and where it will take us. The cathode in this instance still has NMC material but instead of being a bulk core of metal, or multi-shelled material that forms interfaces (instability), you can form a full gradient of NMC metal material. The image below shows the transition from conventional NMC to FCG particles

The gradient allows for high levels of nickel in the core which will increase the battery's energy density while higher levels of manganese in the outer shell increase thermal and life cycle properties, with further increased stability and fast charging as there are no interfaces. There is also a significant reduction in costs relating back to the reduction in cobalt requirements. This will potentially make moves by Apple, Tesla, and Geely pursuing lower density cobalt-free LFP batteries obsolete if cobalt-free ""NMC"" comes into fruition.

This FCG technology will enable mass adoption of NMC 811 batteries, as well as NMC9, NCMA, etc., and eventually cobalt-free batteries, which Microvast has mentioned in their merger details. Their patents and research details have shown they have been capable of achieving nickel contents over 90%. 

The entire purpose of Microvast's efforts working with this technology was that they were tasked by the US DOE with not just making fast-charging batteries, but they had to be **extremely** fast charging, as to match parity with ICE refueling. This was to be accomplished while still maintaining high density, cycle life, and safety which was a part of another battery initiative with GM and Ford. 

It is clear through multiple comments from Microvast and the work being conducted, that Microvast has some form of global exclusive licensing deal for FCG cathodes, like that of BASF and NMC.

This is the result of teaming up with the original inventors of NMC at Argonne along with BMW to further develop FCG technology. They have patented novel manufacturing processes that seek to solve issues with FCG such as creating reproducible gradients across particle samples, as well as testing them in the prismatic form factor.

328,MVST," I honestly think they are being thrown into the China mess because although they are 100% a US company (partnering with the DOE, HQ in Texas etc) they have considerable history of manufacturing and selling in China.  There are some risks there if China decided to play hard ball and use Microvast or other battery players as a bartering chip with US.

In addition, they have been grouped into the SPACS that were over valued and have no revenue.  Microvast has 100 million+ revenue in 2020 and expects 230ish in 2021 and they anticipate being ebitda positive in 2022.  There are hardly any spacs let alone battery companies with this type of performance.

The only way to see this is to dig into their defm14a because they just converted to MVST (from THCB) and they have yet to do a quarterly report.  The defm14a contains the companies financials and other info.  In addition as you can see from the mod taking the posts down constantly here that the sites like yahoo finance and others don’t have the correct updated information yet, so when someone looks it up they see the float and the market cap of the SPAC on most sites (not MVST), so you have to dig into the DEFM14A which contains tons of information.

Like an actual true ape retard my first experience with that stock was buying shares at $55 in June while smoking a joint and watching the market do all kinds of crazy things. Sold the next day at $70 (I got lucky) which I then put into $46 monthly puts and puts on some other meme stocks we won’t mention here. Sold those back in Jul when it crashed to $42. Bought back in when it shot back to $50 at $30 strike price exp EOY. Added to my position on a couple bounces, and I’ve been 💎 ✋ and cuddling with these puts for about month now in my 🌈 🐻 cave.

Today might be the day I finally reap the rewards. Either crash or moon to $90 so I can double down and go back to sleep for 6 months. Just fucking do something because this bear is getting bored and wants to come out of hibernation and eat these tendies dipped in 🍯 made from the tears of bulls. Where my circuit breakers at?

Ok real talk now.

I’m still holding GME shares and the profits I made on AMC made that position a little bigger because I personally believe in RC and the future direction of GameStop more than AMC or any of these other shit meme stock companies. (I’m with you on some things apes, but sometimes you guys truly are retarded IMO). The longer this takes the bigger it gets. Your move wallstreet. I’m a patient ape. 

Kudos to those with shares you bought at the top and still have the balls to hold. Don’t let other apes or the news influence you. There’s also no shame in selling if you realize you actually need the money and losing more would hurt your financial situation and bring more stress into your life. Nobody truly knows for sure how this is going to end or if it already happened. What we do know is one side doesn’t play by the same rules and have an advantage over us. Always remember that. Signs point that this is far from over, but it could also be them seeing how long they can manipulate retail into the next “squeeze” to recover some of their loses before the music stops. You’re a smart ape, figure it out and come up with your own theory. 

Don’t worry about those getting rich or those blowing their entire savings on risky plays. If it feels right to sell, sell. If it feels right to hold, then hold or buy more. Just be confident in your decision and accept the potential risks if it doesn’t play out the way you thought. Think like a logical Ape, not an emotional Ape.

**Stick to the plan that doesn’t keep you up at night and take care of yourself first. That’s what’s most important.**

As long as you’re still making money and improving your situation who the fuck cares what people think about the plays you are making. Always remember that this sub ridiculed DFV in December. I was one of them until I opened my mind to differing opinions that GME wasn’t just a dead brick and mortar store. I had missed and never bothered to even look at all the DD which probably would have made me buy when it was around $20 and I thought no way it could go higher this just had to be a pump and dump. Luckily my wishful thinking limit order ended going through at $69 on one of the dips that day in Jan (again I got lucky, figured I had missed the boat, but I could be sitting at a much better cost ratio right now had I just kept an open mind and listened to what he had to say). Always be thinking two moves ahead and open to all possibilities. Echo chambers is where people get in trouble. 

Listen to the Bulls, but also listen to the Bears and make a smart Ape decision. Nothing in life is guaranteed except death and taxes, not even the MOASS. The best advice I’ve ever seen given on here is “If it’s big enough to take a screenshot, it’s big enough to sell.” You can always buy back in when it feels right. There will always be another play. Especially on options that expire soon. 

Sometimes you make a smart play, sometimes you make a dumb play, but get lucky and recover as long as you’re patient. Sometimes what you think is a smart play at the time turns into the dumbest shit you’ve ever done. Do what feels right for you and accept that it could go either way. The most important thing is not to overextend yourself into $ROPE territory. There have already been suicides over this. 

TLDR: **This isn’t worth your life.**

Nobody here truly knows shit. Doesn’t matter if we’re bear apes or bull apes, deep down we are ALL poor apes compared to the 1% pigs. We are all just trying to make money in a system that is designed for the rich and rigged against us. We all just need to stick together and focus on good quality and properly sourced DD to kill the misinformation. Great things have come out of here and other subs in the past as long as we work together. Personally, I just come here to shit post because fuck you that’s why. 🦍

880,AMC," Here’s my journey with AMC. Like an actual true ape retard my first experience with that stock was buying shares at $55 in June while smoking a joint and watching the market do all kinds of crazy things. Sold the next day at $70 (I got lucky) which I then put into $46 monthly puts and puts on some other meme stocks we won’t mention here. Sold those back in Jul when it crashed to $42. Bought back in when it shot back to $50 at $30 strike price exp EOY. Added to my position on a couple bounces, and I’ve been 💎 ✋ and cuddling with these puts for about month now in my 🌈 🐻 cave.

Today might be the day I finally reap the rewards. Either crash or moon to $90 so I can double down and go back to sleep for 6 months. Just fucking do something because this bear is getting bored and wants to come out of hibernation and eat these tendies dipped in 🍯 made from the tears of bulls. Where my circuit breakers at?

1194,AI," Idk about the other stuff, but placing such high confidence in WALL-E taking everyone's jobs is fundamentally wrong and undermines your whole thesis.

""AI"" is a buzzword that is hyped by media to be something far more powerful than it is. Your post contributes to this disinformation.

The only jobs being automated now and in the next 10 years are the jobs requiring a bare minimum of intelligence and simple rote physical activity -- food service kitchen workers, transportation drivers, warehouse fulfillment, sales clerks, inventory -- the jobs you pay someone minimum wage and 19hrs for so you can do better things with your life.

Fact is, robots are severely limited by both narrow intelligence AND unimpressive physical manipulators. The current __and foreseeable__ state of the art limits robots to doing pre-specified simple mechanical tasks. Headway in advancing both of these areas has made only mild progress over the last three decades, and since those areas are mostly limited by a lack of big idea breakthroughs researchers have instead been focusing on other areas that should tie in to these two missing puzzle pieces -- namely computer vision, natural language processing, imitation learning, and improved hardware specs. They've just been toiling around doing other shit waiting for some genius to come along and figure out the rest.

You commented about Terminator being able to take your job and not making a mistake in the interview... The best we've got coming up are the new animatronics at Disney Land.

So it's false to think that an AI and robot revolution is going to come sweep up the jobs leaving hundreds of millions unemployed -- the vast majority of jobs involve some level of customer service, general labor, or general intelligence, and those are at very low risk of being automated. Same with specialized labor (construction, mechanics) and most creative or human-centric roles (marketing, sales).

1216,GME," I really hope this works out for you but the GME stock is so highly manipulated I dont know what will happen.
-good earnings stock tanks
-transfer from s&p 600 small to s&p 400 mid (like victoria secret and another stock did and went up) and gme went down.
-the stock on rsi is reading as oversold to more than before the jan run up.
-second quarter earnings will be announced and I bet they tank the stock again. 

Edit:

If you've been paying attention then you'll know that the shorting hedge funds will try to keep the market cap lower than the allowed for the s&p 500. If that doesn't work they will probably pay off the persons responsible for voting a company in/out of the s&p. I know that gme is going to smash earnings but there's enormous funds working against this whole situation because it is literally a life or death struggle for their livelihood and company. 

You do have other things working for you which is the end of the eviction moratorium coming up. The debt ceiling being reached and if it is extended that reduces the credit rating of the u.s. Lastly, to my knowledge, you have the delta variant putting the world in lockdown 2.0.

Pulling for you but this is box or Bugatti situation. If this works out you will have earned billions if you can play it right. Honestly hope this happens before October but again life or death.

Editing further:
I would go as far as to say that the market maker would proceed to continue to sell short the company despite it going into the s&p 500 because they have nothing to lose. They have already lost their business so they're just building a larger and larger bomb by doing what they're doing. Ryan cohen has the capacity to nuke this though by releasing an NFT dividend, cusip change, or something that would require a share recall. So, I'm hoping we get an NFT dividend before your calls expire because if we do I could see you easily owning 500 shares for one of your calls. 

Also, why in the fuck is my flair 3 stupid fucking monkeys? I would at least want a hear no, speak no, and say no monkey rather than 3 crappy gorillas.

Last edit:
In fact speaking with others when the IV is low it would be good to buy 1 year plus otm calls for 6.6k I think they were.

AMD powers both PS5 and XBox X, and will be powering the steam deck, which means game designers will be optimizing for AMD hardware heavily which could break Nvidia’s longtime leadership in GPU hardware.

Su Bae is dumping tons of money into R&D while maintaining or gaining leadership in nearly every performance metric and use case, not resting on their position like Intel did post Skylake. 

Tesla is using AMD power as well for their vehicles, so the infotainment/set driving vehicle space seems up for grabs. 

The only downsides or questions hanging have to do with Fabrication- now that TSMC is being used by Intel, Apple, AMD, and anyone who needs 5nm, it may be difficult to keep up with demand until the new TSMC fabs come online.

1285,AMD," Hypothetically if you were making chips, you start with one gigantic wafer of silicon, and you ""cut"" pieces of it off , these pieces are then analyzed and tested to see how much of the circuitry inside the wafer is usable, if the whole wafer is usable this will be used to create one high end sku,  if only half of it is usable then it might be used to make one mid range sku, and so on. This is the traditional monolithic way of doing things. Now with MCM design (multi chip module) let's say you need to fulfill inventory of a high end sku but you only have a bunch of pieces of silicon that can make mid range sku's, now all you have to do in an oversimplified nutshell is take 2 or 3 of those mid range wafers and connect them together, they'll act as one high end wafer. Which man's you didn't have to throw away silicon at a lower end and lower profit margin component.


Edit: the process I describe here is called chip binning and the way AMD bins their chips they have far greater flexibility to create higher end components using multiple mid end components. Generally speaking the highest end components are exempt from this process as it usually requires the full silicon wafer to be functional but this opens the door to drastically increase yields for everything beneath the highest end sku's.",matrixzone5,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oxty90/amd_is_going_to_revolutionize_the_gpu_computing/h7oqy5s/,0.022,0.894,0.083,0.9231
1286,AMD," Good analysis. A few slight clarifications:

> They acquired Xilinx so they are well positioned to kill it in the ARM server market

XLNX makes FPGAs, not ARM server chips. FPGAs do lots of different thing (they can and will be used in servers but they are so much more). And they bring a deep software engineering bench that AMD has often lacked over the years, so the tie up ought to work out well along several lines. 

> now that TSMC is being used by Intel, Apple, AMD, and anyone who needs 5nm, it may be difficult to keep up with demand until the new TSMC fabs come online

Apple will always get first crack at the new stuff because they essentially pay TSMC a premium for it and subsidize its R&D for the newest nodes. Intel has announced a need to turn to TSMC for fabrication of at least some of its leading edge chips, due to its own technical problems. 

However, between AMD and Intel, AMD will be given preference. The reason is simple. Intel has declared open warfare on TSMC with the announcement of its “IDM 2.0” initiative, which aims to open Intel’s fabrication facilities to third parties — essentially, they want to take a chunk of TSMC’s foundry business. As a result, while TSMC will supply Intel to a reasonable extent, they will almost certainly give AMD preference over Intel, as a way to check Intel’s ambitions. 

In other words, TSMC says if you want to cut into our core business (foundry), we will enable AMD to cut into your core business (x86 server and laptop CPUs) by making sure they have whatever they need on the fabrication side of things.",Maximus_Aurelius,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oxty90/amd_is_going_to_revolutionize_the_gpu_computing/h7ptqrj/,0.071,0.867,0.063,-0.5207

1288,AMD," When you ""cut"" the wafer each piece is a whole die (monolithic GPU in your first picture, GPU module in your second). If half of the wafer is usable that doesn't mean you have a midrange part. That means 50% of your dies are getting thrown out.

Binning your chips for speed is a different thing. I would guess smaller dies would mean more dies per wafer, but you would also need 4 dies per package. I could imagine it improving yield, but it doesn't seem all that cut and dry.

By the way, I sold AMD at $12.50, so I am a paper handed bitch and you probably shouldn't listen to me.",carpetedman,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oxty90/amd_is_going_to_revolutionize_the_gpu_computing/h7ovfc7/,0.09,0.877,0.032,-0.765
1289,AMD," You nailed it. I would also like to note that TSMC's preference for AMD also extends to R&D collaboration on packaging, which is evidenced by Zen 3D (V-Cache) and the rumored Milan-X. The bigger AMD gets and the more market share they can take from Intel and Nvidia (the latter of whom have temporarily went to Samsung) the more they will grow and thus need to order from TSMC.",HerpDerpMcChirp,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oxty90/amd_is_going_to_revolutionize_the_gpu_computing/h7q4nk5/,0.0,0.909,0.091,0.6682
1290,AMD," that's what intel is going for. Integrating 14nm+++ architectures with 10nm try to only use 10nm for the parts that actually benefit from it.

btw, on your original question: you expect a certain error rate per unit of area on your fabrication process. Bigger the ASIC, the higher the probability a single chip has a mistake.

Depending on the mistake you could potentially reserve that piece as a lower performing part by disabling the part of the chip with an error.  As you mentioned.

What you can't do is disable it for the high-end parts. The high-end chips, the i9s the 3090s, these are A++ parts. Often in the largest die that is feasible. Feasibility comes from yield. How many fully working chips come out of a wafer given a chip size.   Most of the production cost is per wafer processed, so you want to balance the number of chips you can get out of a single wafer and how much you can sell each one of these chips in that wafer for.

Then there are other market considerations, companies will never drop their flagship price too much even if they have the yield, just because they can make a larger margin on those parts.  Often you see mid-range chips that would be capable of  operating as a more expensive part but were hardware locked cause the company rather do that than to drop the price of the higher tier part.

Anyway, long story short: AMD gets a higher yield by making smaller chipsets which have a higher chance of being a higher end part (instead of a mammoth one with lower yield). They then have to pay the manufacturing step of actually getting these chiplets working together.  You'd think that post processing is expensive, but given the price of a single wafer at the smallest node in TSMC, they're better off with that strategy.

You're right, nationalization wouldn't surprise me either given the purpose of this new regulation was to improve education accessibility and birth rate.

1. You should plan to exercise ***some*** of those options. Especially if those are under 1 year. Because you'll be taxed at Short-Term capital gains rather than LT cap gains which is lower (assuming you're in the US). 

2. When you exercise your calls you don't pay taxes because you're just buying at a lower price. In fact, it reduces your taxable amount because you paid out premium.

3. You can follow the suggestions of your fellow apes and try ~~losing it all~~ rolling the dice one more time before the end of the year.

4. You can reduce your taxes with IRA/401k on your wages, donations to causes you like (it's underrated you'll get perks, good IRL karma, you can post about it on reddit if you adopt some apes for internet karma, or just feel good about it), and finally you can just pay your fair share to the tax man.

Arbitrageurs (smart Harvard/wife’s boyfriend material types) bought XLNX shares after AMD acquisition of XLNX was announced and bought puts/sold calls on AMD. Make free money when deal closes sometime in 2nd half 2021.

August 2021 
Buyers (including smooth 🧠🤳like myself) buy AMD causing price to go up from $70 to $120.

Arbitrageurs  that hold AMD short positions are now under water. 😬 Some arbs unwind/close out by selling XLNX to pay off the short AMD positions under water.

1619,CB," Indeed. I believe some of the shares just came out of lockup on the 26th, and that was when I bought the ""dip"" with a CB of $36. In hindsight all the signs are there that it was a scam, and I was aware of the possibility but there was no way to know that it would play out like this. Very well executed fraud and they will probably get away with it, because what can retail do?

These hedges are beyond too greedy. The synthetics and dark pool movements are now being confirmed to be preventing the short squeeze by the SEC themselves and they're investigating it.

The current price is significantly undervalued for the short squeeze. If you look at the minor amount of shorts they covered in June you can see the major movements that can happen when they cover even a small portion of their short positions.

You hear ""I want to buy this thing and I don't have a shipping date"" and think ""that's amazing, they're selling faster than they can get things.

&#x200B;

What you're missing is the 90% of the iceberg under the surface.  Supply chains are disrupted, inflation is fucking with margins (which is why $CRSR's numbers were so weird with one big beat and one big miss).  And $CRSR sounded the alarm on not only these issues, but also a forseen slowdown in demand as people focus their wealth on things other than buying components that keep them trapped in the house.  Earnings beats say what they already did - everybody knows that everyone went out and spent the last year building computers and home offices.  What's important is what they're going to do next year.

The buyout deal is a stock swap conversion for 1.7 AMD shares to 1 Xilinx share. The monetary value can fluxuate because it's paid in shares, not cash. No one said Xilinx should be worth what AMD is, but the deal is based on that hinge of 1.7 AMD shares per.

The 35B is the value of the 1.7 stock swap from when the deal was announced, but it's fixed on the stock swap, not the cash amount.
