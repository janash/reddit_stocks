4,COST,"  Do not be fooled! 
Apple hasn’t mysteriously become altruistic. 
Do you think the same company that forces their own devices into obsolescence so you can buy more on a yearly basis is in your corner? Devices mind you that are made with rare earth metals and questionable labor. 
No no no. This is competitive- not charitable-behavior. They have not disallowed tracking on their own App Store and within the iOS platform. 
Facebook played this so badly too. 

I’ve spent actually HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of dollars on FB ad spend (I’m a small fish too). Since April of last year, ad inventory has gotten like 5x more expensive. Ads on Facebook get inflated by a lot of factors but the one affecting CPMs (cost per thousand impressions) was VC funded companies that sell things nobody wants. The next was the election. Even with all the sophisticated tracking - people would comment “is Facebook reading my mind?” on our ads every day - ads have already been getting way too expensive. Our performance on ads is unusually good. Still, Facebook has steadily raised the price of ad space. They want you to give them every profit dollar knowing you’ll continue to pay for break-even “customer acquisition.” They even say that in their literature  to ad buyers. I’ll search for that link. 

This is actually the perfect smokescreen for Facebook to say, “see it’s apple hurting your business.” Facebook serves a warning on the ad console saying something to that effect. Except Facebook sets the CPMs!! This is not some perfect market where there is no centralized influence. Facebook warns me “your ads will be less effective because of... reasons.” You know what would make ads more effective? LOWER THE COST OF YOUR INCREASINGLY INEFFECTIVE AD SPACE! The iOS14 stuff could not have come at a better time for them. 

I don’t know why Apple is doing this. Maybe to sell more iPhones? Honestly that seems like the naïve explanation. I’m sure it’s something more nefarious. I promise they do not have your best interest in mind. 

You are still going to get ads guys. They will simply be less targeted. Is that good? I don’t know. If anything the day has been won by VC funded zombies -that only look like businesses but whose charge is to sell their equity not their product. Because they don’t care if produce a profit on ads. They don’t care is they ever generate a financial profit. So they spend on ads regardless of return just to drive their topline. So if getting more ads for the next Casper clone sounds good, then you are in luck my friend. 

I support privacy measures. I’m using them myself on iOS14. I browse with brave when I remember to. The real privacy is not exposing us to marketing images - we all know that Is never happening.

Most other companies, FB, Twitter, Google, provide free to use services first and foremost. They need to make money to keep providing those free services. 

If users are willing to move to a subscription based system where they pay for FB, Twitter, and Google (Gmail, YouTube, search), then these companies wouldn't have to collect user data to sell to advertisers.

11,FB," If you all want a serious answer I've been a media buyer for a decade and now run an adtech startup. I'm intimately familiar with the space. 

Winners I think will be legacy media companies, Google, and companies that primarily deliver content through mobile apps that require a sign in. (As they have first party data they dont lose as much targeting power) think Spotify, Pandora, YouTube, Hulu, etc.

Losers will most likely be: companies that rely on banner ad sales (mediamath, trade desk, etc). Local publishers, niche blogs, etc. The longtail is going to hurt. Also I would bet shopify takes a beating. The only reason those stores got so popular was on the back of FB ads. 

The death of the cookie is not the death of the ad by a long shot. People will continue to spend more on ads as markets get more competitive. Looks for money to move into sandboxed experiences where they hold first party data (social media), legacy and more intteruptive ads, look for a revival in things like OOH and audio.",jeromysonne,12,/r/stocks/comments/n7eybf/96_of_us_users_opt_out_of_app_tracking_in_ios_145/gxezqx9/,0.097,0.8,0.103,-0.1859

13,GPS," > just two of us on the couch talking. Ten minutes later, I pick up my phone and see an ad for the very thing I just mentioned

Facebook doesn't listen to your conversations. It isn't technically feasible and it would be easily detected by anyone with the skills to jailbreak the phone and would be major news. Not only that Apple and Google would be able to detect it and Facebook would be kicked off their platforms so fast. On Apples platform at least if any app is using the microphone in the background you have a red banner on the home screen.

Here’s a really basic example: using your mic, an advertiser can find out what you’re watching on TV by fingerprinting the audio. For instance, I watched the hockey game tonight on NBC and saw a nationally televised ad for Geico.  If I buy Geico insurance, then the advertiser is able to attribute my purchase to the ad I saw on TV.

Think about your argument like this: an advertiser is willing to go through a lot of trouble to collect data on you. They’re also able to collect your audio, but for some reason they choose not to do it?

You can use a VPN, Linux, encrypt your data (.zip files conveniently offer this which are useful for sending over the internet already) DuckDuckGo.com and some other means I’m sure I’m forgetting to help get around all the tracking.

Now we report this as expected pre-income to per-collateralize it via intra-margin without actually incurring a margin by pre-day trading.

Then carry it over to the corporate projections graph using a thick sharpie making the pre-projection have a standard deviation of another 2%.

Now that gives us a ceiling of 31% yoy pre-gains... but we cant have a ""1"" in the single digits because that will seem like a double buttcheek rimjob pattern, so lets post-floor it to 30%.

I have at least 10+ year hold objective with $VTI. I'm looking forward to seeing what the next few years bring for $VTI. They contain all my favorite growth stocks plus some more.   
$SPY has witnessed seven red daily ricks that haven't moved the price at all, but I still do believe that this will prove to be a safe and profitable stock in the long run.   
$ZKIN, on the other hand, is a relatively new stock that's a monster in the making. Their price recently bounced off the $5.18 level to move to $5.45  after finding strong support.

SpaceX and Blue Origin both have vertical launch infrastructure. Not nearly as accessible to the general public, nor proven to be as safe as horizontal. Not to mention horizontal launch is exponentially more efficient and cost effective for sub-orbital travel over vertical launches. That's all to say, neither SpaceX or BO have proper business models in place specifically for tourism and accessibility, or at least certainly not in the niche that SPCE is/could dominate.

437,LMND," Thanks for the write up. Reading that was the most time I’ve spent looking at this company. I also know nothing about the insurance business so I go on gut feelings.  

TBH renters & pet insurance are probably the only things I would ever use them for because of the simplicity of signing up.   But I no longer rent and wouldn’t bother signing up since they don’t offer auto/boat/etc.  (auto doesn’t show up on their site so maybe that was an error?).  Getting a customer in with renters and hoping that they eventually jump to homeowners makes sense but it’s safe to assume the retention would be limited to people that don’t own vehicles.  I think the niche for them is in the renters market.  Small and minimal claims seem like an easy way to be successful as an app based insurance provider. 

Alright now watch how dumb i am...Renters insurance is a 3.4B market, lots of players in this game and googling puts them at 7th on the list so even if you give them 1/7th of the market it’s still a rough P/S ratio.  I honestly would not have heard of LMND if it wasn’t a hot stock for awhile.

440,ALL," The part I can't make heads or tails is what is driving that growth. Are they growing faster than legacy insurance companies because they're a new player that are offering rates that have driven an initial jump in subscribers. Or do they offer something truly unique that is retaining subscribers, driving down costs which they are then passing on to subscribers? I find that most subscribers will just pick the cheapest option?

If you are PGR, ALL or TRV, and you already own 90% of the market, its very hard to grow new customers. If you're a new player, it makes sense you're growing new subscribers faster than the incumbents. But then again, in their shareholder letter for Q4, they said they hit the same number of subscribers as USAA (1M subscribers) in just 4 years whereas it took USAA 47 years. But this doesn't feel like a fair measurement because USAA is restrictive in their model.

For LMND, I would love to see subscriber growth far outstrip the TAM growth. Their current revenue projections don't align to the subscriber growth that justifies their tech company multiplier does it? I'd love to know more if you believe in their growth numbers.

They're projecting 317M in premium for CY2021. This means they expect either 1.7MM customers at premium of $213 per customer (their 2020 rate) or they need to juice their premium per customer to offset their subscriber growth.

In there Q4 earnings call they said that they hit 1M subscribers with $213 of premium per subscriber: https://s24.q4cdn.com/139015699/files/doc_downloads/2021/Q4-2020-LMND-Shareholder-Letter_vF.pdf

They're projecting 317M in premium for CY2021. This means they expect either 1.7MM customers at premium of $213 per customer (their 2020 rate) or they need to juice their premium per customer to offset their subscriber growth.

Either way, I think the Q1 numbers will set the story for which direction this is going. If they have to increase their premiums, I could see downward pressure as it becomes harder to maintain their customer base. Insurance is a fungible resource, and I don't know if there is as much customer loyalty in insurance as other markets.",radarbot,6,/r/stocks/comments/n7mz6p/lmnd_an_over_valued_insurance_stock_pretending_to/gxdqlwg/,0.027,0.842,0.131,0.9886
444,AI," Where I'm really getting caught up is behaviour in the insurance industry by subscribers. LMND is betting that they'll be able to gather and retain customers, specifically younger customers, who want a more personalized and streamlined experience in insurance. Focusing on renter, pet and auto insurance, they're trying to create an ecosystem that is leveraging sell through. But at what point does price start to matter? What does LMND need to do to maintain high subscriber growth because they are already seeing it slow down. And if they see it slow down, will they start increasing premium?

Also, insurance is regulated as it requires the underwriters to be able to pay out claims so they can't be over leveraged. Which fundamentally means that margins tend to be low.

The problem I personally made for myself is that I don't know the insurance industry well enough to know how LMND's AI and customer service can overcome macro factors in subscriber behaviour.

That was my initial impression when comparing the two. I liked PGR’s current business more than ALL, but the latter was better priced (plus a nice div). With their current cash flows I feel pretty safe putting some money in there.

Edit: I’m also highly skeptical that a company like Tesla is going to eat up significant market share (at least in the next 10+ years).

I give them a year or two before they have to deal with that bugbear.

\- Brand Dilution: GW's branding has been overall better then it's competitors, with Hasbro (Magic the Gathering, Dungeons & Dragons) having overall better managed branding then GW. GW has books tie-in, IP licensing for videogames, and been playing with other ventures like collectibles. The hurdle for GW is dilution, as GW is willing to pull pieces of IP apart and give them to developers to play with, with little regard to quality control. This gets you duds like 40K Space Hulk: Deathwing or 40K: Regicide, or failing to keep up quality for well regarded series like 40K: Dawn of War.",BagFullOfKittenBones,1,/r/stocks/comments/n7hr9d/my_top_holdings_and_why_i_hold_them/gxf4qi5/,0.049,0.817,0.133,0.9571

If it’s done correctly then it can pay off. However the point of rebalancing is to reduce volatility/risk, not to increase gains. You’re in individual stocks and crypto...that’s about as risky as it gets and now you’re wanting to add speculative high growth stocks? Yikes. I’d step back and figure out why you’re doing what you’re doing.

This entire comment isn’t financial advice....I think it would be better to sell Tesla and buy VTI or VOO.


> I don´t want to argue about Teladoc here, it´s just an example......In my opinion, Teladoc has a very bright future, it has really good fundamentals, high growth curve and will (again in my opinion) exponentially grow in the next years/decades. Since e.g. Teladoc is down by 50% from ATH, what do you think about that?


You don’t want to argue about teladoc...but then give bad reasons on why you should buy it. 


IMO. There’s typically reasons why stocks fall 50%. That isn’t normal for stocks to fall 50% for no reason. You’re missing information and I think it would be wise to avoid such stocks you don’t understand.

This right here shows your lack of knowledge. TDOC is not profitable, management has said growth in the company will be very little in 2021, and by some analysts they might experience negative growth. I think it was their Q1 results, analysts set a target of -$0.50 a share and TDOC ended up with -$1.30 something. In other words they lost a lot of money. You’re also forgetting that TDOC operates in a space with no business moat, what’s stopping a competitor from doing the same thing they’re doing? I’ll give you a hint, there are bigger competitors starting to enter the telehealth space. Also what’s stopping doctor’s offices from providing their own teladoc like services for cheaper?

491,ATH," Valuations for some of these high growth names weren’t just “pretty high”, they were (and honestly still are) completely detached from their fundamentals. 

As for teladoc, what in their cash flow, income statement, or balance sheet tells you that they are currently under/fairly valued? I couldn’t care less if a company fell 50% from ATH if it’s still overvalued.

While I think the bulk of FAANG is still overvalued, it’s much more reasonable and you’re invested in better companies than ones like teladoc.

On top of that, there is quite some dilution going on right now, so that is causing some selling pressure aswell, which makes it harder to maintain the current SP. People that work for the company have had their shares vested for years, so makes sense that they take some profit now.

I do believe it will be a better performer than the S&P 500 going forward. Time will tell. I am willing to make it one of my larger positions in my port for long term.

531,BAC," At the most basic level you’re selling a call against the shares you own. Realistically, the goal is to pick a strike price where you don’t think it’ll hit before expiration so you keep the premium and keep the shares so you can turn around and do it again.

Worst case is that you collect the premium, the call gets exercised and you have to sell them for the strike price.

Ex: I have 500 BAC shares I bought at $22.50 last March during the COVID tanking. Recently I was going to liquidate some of them to diversify elsewhere but decided just to sell calls against a couple hundred of the shares. Figured I would collect the premium and if they for exercised I was fine with it since I wanted to sell some anyway and I would have made a good profit on them.

What you’ll also find is that the more volatile the stock the higher the premium usually. So BAC’s premium wasn’t bad. Better than, for example, T, but definitely not rolling in the dough on the premiums.",NativeTxn7,2,/r/stocks/comments/n7fa04/covered_calls_baby/gxej82q/,0.051,0.819,0.13,0.9337

IMO investors should have a core position of something low-feethat covers the entire market or a cross section of the market. there's nothing wrong with augmenting that with some speciality/sector funds or active management or other strategies. there are many roads to heaven, to paraphrase Warren Buffett. there's research showing the most important thing is just saving money into whatever options are a available. 

In a taxable account, ETFs can have an edge over index funds/mutual funds. ETFs are usually structured to minimize capital gains.

561,AMD," I have a lot to say on Intel, a lot of good, a good amount of bad. I already made a long comment about them in another thread, but I probably need to make a longer post.

My biggest concerns aren't AMD, or even ARM, they are if Intel can actually execute their promises for once in the last 5 years, and if the market actually cares, because if you look at Intel, even when they were at the top of their game, when AMD was nearing bankruptcy, and ARM was just for mobile chips, the market didn't care. They are treated like a blue chip, not a tech, and when the market actually shifts to blue chips, they don't shift to Intel. It's like the market hates Intel and just let's it trade sideways.

I'm not sure if I'll go long on Intel, they will either be a hidden gem that will double value in the upcoming years or you'll get your 3% dividend and have no other returns from them.",Put_It_All_On_Blck,1,/r/stocks/comments/n7u1c0/for_those_who_keep_asking_for_value_options_in/gxfbe4a/,0.08,0.795,0.125,0.8082
