Not saying it to be critical, it‚Äôs literally how we can do this. As a general rule, we either have faith in the company or faith in the technicals/DD of the company so we don‚Äôt care when the price dips 20-30% or more in high volatility. We‚Äôre reasonably certain that, given enough time, it‚Äôll come back. Or, best case, a catalyst will hit that brings it back even faster. 

In the meantime, panic sellers are having anxiety attacks over $18 and we‚Äôre buying your shares for cheap and holding them (along with our initial, probably more expensive shares so you actually probably just helped us average down....thanks!) until the next time when we do this whole thing all over again.

But that was stupid, I should have just been doing 8 CCs with a strike price of $1.50.  If the stock gets to $1.50 and the contract gets exercised, great, I *wanted* to sell at $1.50.  If not, I get to keep a small premium every month, and keep my stocks. Lather rinse repeat until the stock gets to $1.50, or goes down so low that I get comfortable selling @ $1.00 instead and do CCs for that amount.",Agentbolt,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m84bsc/i_think_a_lot_of_you_are_missing_the_easy_money/gribmxm/,0.062,0.782,0.156,0.9145

34,CC," Correct on both counts* and your parenthetical aside!

*Slight asterisk that you can't lose money on that single trade if you sell the CC out of money, which is usually what's meant. This is an important asterisk though, as if you're wheeling and the underlying goes down then you might not lose money on that specific trade but lose money overall as you continue to CC.

Example:
You own a stock at 10
You get CC premium of 1 for a strike of say 12
However, the underlying drops to 5. You keep the 1 premium and try again.
You CC again with a premium of 1 with a 7 strike
Underlying jumps to 10 again, but your strike was 7
Stocks are called away at 7
You've ""won"" both CC but still net lost 1 (stocks sold for 7 plus two 1 premiums for a total of 9 to the original 10)

You've won two battles but lost the war. You could certainly keep your strikes above original cost, but the premiums could rapidly diminish as that price is further out of the money. If the stock bounces back, great. That may be a week, a year or never. One day, you realize you're sitting on a stock worth a buck fifty getting 10 cents of premium",RiceSautes,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m84bsc/i_think_a_lot_of_you_are_missing_the_easy_money/grfj5km/,0.099,0.773,0.128,0.7742
35,ASRT," Selling a put.  I said selling a put.  

When you sell a $1 put on ASRT, you receive a $20 premium.  At the end of the month if the stock price is under $1, you are forced to buy the stock at $1/share.  This ends up with you buying 100 shares at about 80 cents per share.",rage-fest,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m84bsc/i_think_a_lot_of_you_are_missing_the_easy_money/gri2vml/,0.053,0.869,0.078,0.1027

AGTC is exactly what I like in a swing trade stock. 1) long-term potential, 2) barely any hype, at the moment, 3) regular swings of 5% to 10% on a weekly and sometimes even a DAILY basis.

Bombardier i think has potential just fyi. I was thinking about getting into em for a while.

140,ATNF," 1. This was a very old SPAC that started in 2017 and took forever and ever to complete merger
2. Because of delays, lot of shareholders ""redeemed"" their shares (You can do this in SPACs)
3. This gave a false impression that the company might not be good
4. This SPAC had 12 million rights that automatically convert into 1.2 million shares after the merger.
5. Most of the right holders bought them between .10 and .30(which equates to $1 to $3 in price)
6. After the merger, most of the rights holders dumped their shares to lock in profit or break even rather than wait for the common to go up
7. Hence the big drop from $11 to $2
8. The fundamentals of this company and team are world class. So it's just a matter of time it's true value is reflected in the share price. 
9. SPAC managers are NOT involved in the operations or management of ATNF in any way shape or form. They have nothing to do with ATNF anymore.
