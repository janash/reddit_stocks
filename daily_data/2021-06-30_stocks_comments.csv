Cloudflare - imo the best CDN and has a large customer base. Cyber security will just be get even more important as time goes on.

Funko - huge play into nerd culture that is just growing and growing. They are expanding into the children sector and to me kids and nerds spend the most amount of money. NFT is nice but i am not banking on that for Funko to grow

STEM - A SPAC but imo it's the best play into renewable energy sector. The way I see it the only way for our electric generation to be 100% renewable is through virtual power plants (in short you save electricity when it's easily generated (ie windy days or sunny days) and use the saved electricity when it's harder to generate. Some areas may generate more electricity than others so you sell from high generation areas to low generation areas) Mix and match renewable sources for maximum success. The weather related failure of the power grid is just showing the problems with a centralised power grid that STEM can solve as well. 

Kroger, Unilever, Proctor Gamble, Kimberly Clark - recession proof, for UL PG and KMB the range of products and brand power will almost ensure that they will thrive in the future. Kroger imo the best grocery stock.

Huya/Douyu - streaming is the future, Huya and Douyu individually are bigger than Twitch and they have a better monetization structure. Being Chinese (although not from China) I know how much mainlanders love their eSports and Huya has that sector on lockdown. Imo the death of traditional sport channels in china will be at the hands of Huya but even if they don't, the gaming industry is big in China and is getting bigger. If Douyu and Huya merges, it's practically a monopoly. It's already profitable and the YoY growth is amazing.

Edit: I think all mentioned will be big in 10 years time but I think some of them are extremely overvalued.

343,FB," ""They aren't going anywhere"". Big disagree. They aren't going completely away, even myspace is around today, but I don't think they have a future 10 years from now with a strong valuation. Facebook did a lot of things right that Myspace didn't. However, FB made a lot of the same mistakes that Myspace did. Ads, clutter, and other revenue stream activities. Great for the stock, on the short term, but plenty of things that the users themselves dislike. 

In January this year, a report came out noting that daily active users in the US has stalled. I've also noticed a trend personally with people not using it. Back in 2010, I had a campus life university job. I had countless new freshmen talking about how they only use FB for keeping in touch with their parents/grand parents, and that Instagram was what was cool. I have friends who are teachers (K-12) and that trend is even more prevalent today, except even IG use is declining (which is bad for FB as well since they own it). 

Privacy concerns, ads, complexity, and user experience are all reasons that younger generations are not on board with it. It's more cumbersome to share thoughts or videos compared to TikTok (which I hate). Photo posting, organization, and viewing just feels antiquated. And I think it will take company doing what Facebook did: creating a more trendy, user friendly, clean, and youth-focused platform to accelerate an exodus.

486,AMD," Idk, I entirely get what you’re saying and would agree that this is somewhat true for any company; but while AMD is becoming increasingly competitive, the disparity within the game development scene is still apparent, or atleast it was when I left the industry just before the pandemic. 

Firstly, while AMD is unquestionably good, the Nvidia products still outperform AMD’s implementation on many features, including but not limited to, Ray-tracing, which is something that’s been spoken about in the games industry at length with next generation consoles.

Now the logical conclusion is ‘better performing GPUs=more capability for developers= their card of choice for development’- this thought process is entirely justifiable, however, it is also completely wrong. A lot of GPU choice in big development companies, and sometimes smaller ones, is related to ‘devrel’ (developer relations)- in bigger companies, GPU manufacturers will approach the developers and offer to pay to have their GPU as the primary one- ever seen the opening cinematic to a game and it comes up with NVidia/whichever manufacturers logo? Now of course that company didn’t develop the game, but they did provide the processor under the impression the game would then be associated with it. 

Nvidia are far more influential in this respect, even when I was working for a smaller studio with one relatively successful game, Nvidia contacted management and provided them with top of the range GPU’s for free, as long as the studio heads agreed to have their game primarily associated with Nvidia, and be featured in their ‘Game ready’ drivers on the GeForce App. 

Essentially, Nvidia is a Titan, AMD is an Olympic God.

518,AMD," A lot of people do! It’s a logical thought process, albeit logic isn’t always ‘right’. 

https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/what-does-it-mean-when-a-game-has-amd-or-nvidia-branding/

This article does a somewhat adequate job of explaining it (if you shift through the irrelevant tech breakdown content that’s painted as a fact, but is actually highly situational)

there’s a line toward the end that does say, ‘I’ve seen AMD branded games that ended up running better on Nvidia GPUs, or Nvidia promoted games that end up performing better on AMD GPUs’- this is so amazingly accurate, it made me laugh. 

Here’s one of Nvidias options as a developer looking to work with them, so you can get a rough statement from the horses mouth- 

https://developer.nvidia.com/indie-spotlight

Note how it specifically refers to ‘GeForce marketing channels’- just because a game doesn’t come up in your GeForce supported section, or doesn’t have its own reference in a game ready driver, doesn’t mean your GPU won’t run it! 

That link is about applying for partnership, but they do also reach out to successful games, as I’m sure AMD do too, but my personal experience is limited to Nvidia. Of course it’s highly unlikely that one will take you on if their competitor already has, they want the guise of exclusivity, rather than cooperation

570,CRWD," As a whole industry, absolutely. But coming from someone who's been in this industry for well over a decade, it's really hard to determine which publicly traded cybersecurity companies will not only stay afloat but thrive. New companies form in this industry all the effing time. I'd see it every year at RSA Conference in San Francisco. Some will grow into large companies, even public ones; others will see growth but get acquired by large corp, and others will see growth then fizzle out. The kicker: you don't know who it will be.

Let's take Crowdstrike, for example. Their protection capabilities are nothing stellar. To be honest, I can think of a few other vendors I would pick first before deploying their stack. But they're crushing it with their numbers, but not in a good way. I have current coworkers who worked there and former coworkers who currently work there, and they over-work their sales team to the bone, Wolf of Wall Street style. They have an insanely good LTV:CAC ratio, which means not only do they find new business, they renew a ton of that same business each year. But what happens when a lot of the sales staff are tired of constantly rising quota's without increase in pay? What happens when new hires get fed one thing and then experience another? What happens when multiple competitors, who already provide better protection, scale their sales teams? If we go by how good the products and services are, Crowdstrike is not one to invest long term in.

If I was confident in a company in this industry, believe me, I'd already be investing in them, I'm privy to a lot more info in this industry than most. But there isn't a single publicly traded cybersecurity company that I'd vouch for. All the ones that I would vouch for are all private. Perhaps if Crowdstrike starts to acquire the best technology from the hottest cybersecurity start-ups, I'd invest then, but until that happens, I'm staying away. And look, I'm not a short term trader, when I buy, I hold. I personally think CRWD is way too overvalued and I think that over the next couple years, customers will see that their security stack is not as good as some competitors (if they don't acquire new technology, of course).

And SentinelOne. They don't even generate $100 mil in revenue yet they have an $11 bil market cap??? Are you fucking kidding me? The private security company I work for does a quarter billion yet if we had the same 110 P/S ratio, we'd be worth $27 billion, and my options would be worth well over a million bucks. And that's not even considering their security stack. They don't offer sandboxing for analysis (pretty big), their prone to false positives (per contacts of mine), reports of quality issues due to rapid releases, and a minor issue that customers have to deploy updates in batches of 50 at a time. So I don't get why people even deploy that fucking company, man. We beat them out on deals all the time.",Ok-Self-2273,1,/r/stocks/comments/oav9mb/what_are_your_projected_growth_sectors_over_the/h3lvc75/,0.044,0.858,0.098,0.9842

Same with AR (I don't believe in VR, too closed-in), maybe that will pop a bit sooner. I can see Apple pulling an AR play in 2027 but if they released something next year, it would probably disappoint. This technology still has to mature.

My personal favorite bet that's in a similar category is lab-grown meat, I see that being the norm 30 years from now.

As soon as there's a company that's crystallizing as actually figuring that space out (think Tesla and electric cars), it's certainly worth jumping at.

601,EA," EA is going to be a monster in the coming years (although it already is).

Continuos revenue stream through Apex Legends (and growing YOY), FIFA generates a stupid amount of money, Ultimate Team especially (all of its variants generated  $1.49bn just in FY 2020) and growing YOY. 

The new Battlefield game is launching later this year, the expectations around it are unreal and, although there are no pre order data yet, just based off general hype and the gamer-groups I know, it may very well be the best selling BF game (and also it seems EA plans to give it the Apex treatment, making it a live service game with at least a 5 year life cycle, which means another great constant revenue stream for them).

Rumours on DICE (an EA studio) starting development on Battlefront 3 (a Star Wars multiplayer game similar to battlefield) and Respawn (creators of Apex) working on the sequel for Jedi Fallen order (the first game sold 10M copies in the first 4 months).

Pot has effectively no entry cost.  There are other barriers to grow your own but $$ isn’t one of them.

I believe 40% of the money supply was creating from this COVID money printing stuff they did recently. It would be embarrassing to say damnit guys we messed up and now we need to tame inflation. Even Janet Yellen hinted at the fact that they are aware this is ALOT of inflation, and this FED member: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/feds-jim-bullard-sees-first-interest-rate-hike-coming-as-soon-as-2022.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/feds-jim-bullard-sees-first-interest-rate-hike-coming-as-soon-as-2022.html)

There is a great divide within the FED\`s central planning right now. They are just kind of going along with what Jerome Powell says publicly.

&#x200B;

c) I saw that states are literally rejecting the extra federal unemployment benefits because its causing people to not want to work and just collect a paycheck. There are a ridiculous amount of jobs right now everywhere. People sort of or kind of just dont want to work right now (I am not sure why for this one).  So the ""unemployment"" is more transitory than the inflation in my opinion.

AMD is also neck and neck with Nvidia for GPUs, but unlike Intel i see them as strong competition in the future so i doubt they will end up being the un questioned leader in the GPU market.

Would this get through a monopoly style approval?  Comcast owning the content is one thing, but owning the hardware side could be difficult without some separations enforced.

Been using ROKU personally forever and was an early investor.  Clearly should have purchased more shares.  What I do hold is up significantly.

Would this get through a monopoly style approval?  Comcast owning the content is one thing, but owning the hardware side could be difficult without some separations enforced.

Currently business is booming and they were brought down with the other transports but they always rise to the top in the long run.

I strongly encourage you to start listening to their quarter reports and you will hear during the conference calls that they are running an absolute Superior business to other companies.   Their operating ratio is unreal and their cash on hand is awesome and they carry very little debt.   

They've been managed by the same family for several decades and our growth potential is still very high.

835,IMO," It's not pundits that are saying inflation is transitory, its Jerome Powell and other members of the Fed

I agree with you, prices are high right now no denying that. Though IMO that is due to mostly due to disruptions stemming for the pandemic and ""base effects"" as prices recover from the collapse last year

As the economy continue to reopen, I expect the disruptions caused in the supply chain and labor market to lessen, and with saving-laden consumers finally emerging, I dont see higher prices as too much of a negative right now.

To be clear I am not saying inflation is not going on and by transitory it doesn't mean a few weeks or months. Higher Inflation will likely continue for at least the rest of the year. That said, I think it is very unlikely we are at the beginning of a problematic, multi-year inflationary cycle.

Moreover, after the SPY fell 4% in mid-May following panic after the release of the April Consumer Index, stocks have powered ahead despite more, higher than expected readings coming out since then. So I would say it is fair to say fears have tempered as of now",psychotrader00,3,/r/stocks/comments/ob5k2v/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_wednesday_june/h3loqht/,0.122,0.843,0.036,-0.9509
836,GDP," 1. Im confused by what you mean by interests. The Fed has a dual mandate: maintaing inflation stable and maximum employment. Powell has consistently reiterated he sees current inflationary pressures being transitory and will wait for the labor market to imprive before doing any adjustments. Of course he isn't going to come out and say he thinks it's doom and gloom, that makes no sense. Also you know the infrastructure bill is in Congress, the Fed has absolutely nothing to do with that.

2. Food is a bad example to use given it's a staple and price is always volatile. This is why food and energy prices are not included in core inflationary readings. Inflation is measures year-over-year and during this time last year we were in the height of the pandemic and prices collapsed across the board. Now they are rebounding. Using your example (though it's not a very good one for the purpose of inflation) if the price of meat fell 20% last year last year, of course a burger would be worth 20% more comparatively now that it recovered.

3. It is simply a fact Americans today have a very high level of savings due to stimulus. Why would that money not be spent on goods and services? Consumer spending accounts 70% of consumer GDP. Using personal experience doesn't apply to macro trends.",psychotrader00,2,/r/stocks/comments/ob5k2v/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_wednesday_june/h3lrmrm/,0.09,0.875,0.035,-0.9205

872,TTM," There are many ways to calculate PE ratios. Most of the time, they are likely using different Earnings amounts. Some people like to use TTM earnings, some people like to use earnings from fiscal year end, some use average earnings over a certain amount of years, forward earnings, etc. 

Price also sometimes vary, I see some people use average price over a year, current price, day closing price, fiscal year end priced, etc. 

There is no one correct way of calculating a PE ratio because at the end of the day, all methods they use, use a variation of “price” and “earnings”. This is why you should calculate your own PE ratios.",WonderfulIngenuity95,3,/r/stocks/comments/oahrio/websites_show_different_pe_ratios/h3hmx2p/,0.02,0.917,0.063,0.5994
873,TTM," Different websites don’t take into account that you’ll use other websites to compare companies. One website one prefer one way to calculate PE over the other because they believe it’s a more reliable measure. 

For instance, TTM PE vs Forward PE. One website might prefer TTM PE more than the other because they might believe it’s a more accurate measure of what the “true” earnings are for a company because it’s already earned (past tense - achieved). While another website might prefer a Forward PE because they believe companies are valued for their future earnings hence, using projected earnings is a more accurate depiction of whether or not a company is undervalued. If a company has a historically inconsistent earnings, you might choose an average PE over a TTM for example. 

Is one right or wrong? Not really, they both have their own arguments supporting their own calculation of PE. This just really goes to show that not one metric can be reliably used as a base measure for all industries/ companies.   

Investing isn’t really about getting it numerically correct. You want to be “just about” correct than absolutely wrong. If investing and figuring out a company is over or undervalued is a complete numerical game, computers would already be invented for it and there would be no jobs in the industry besides the mechanical/ maintenance staff. 

You don’t necessarily have to calculate it yourself, you can use a website if you really want, but like I previously mentioned. Websites typically just use 1 way of calculating PE since it’s typically run by software programs. That one way might not necessarily be the “best” way of valuing a company. Again, Forward PEs might be better in growth companies and TTM PEs might be better for more stable companies.

Besides my long winded explanation above, the other comment actually answers your main question about industry averages more accurately as well.

884,AMC," You’d be okay if they sold your car? I guess I have a moral and ethical problem with selling something on loan.  But the issue is that it creates a fictitious supply by someone who’s not the title holder, who loaned or stole it from someone who is not a willing seller, otherwise he/she would have sold it, not loaned it. The act of selling something entails conveying ownership, you shouldn’t be able to convey ownership of something you don’t own, that makes it a fictitious supply.  The proof is in the next part of the supply/demand definition, it that neither party should be acting with a “compulsion”. When you are forced to buy something because you sold another that was not rightfully in your ownership, you create a compulsion to buy, at whatever price regardless of how fair the value, that is why squeezes result in sky high prices. If AMC did not print another 11m shares, it’s price would have sky-rocketed even further, because of the “compulsion”.  Short selling breaks the system, plain and simple.

900,ABC," When you sell a covered call it will show up as a negative position. So it would be like -1 contracts for example. 

You can’t force the owner of the call you sold to exercise when you want, but you can close your covered call trade but then buying the same option you sold to close. So if you sold a call for ABC co on july 21, you’d sell to open, and collect the option premium. If you decide to sell you shares you’d still have the liability of the call option you sold, meaning you still owe ABC at the strike price on July 21 if it were in the money. 

To end you liability you’d find the same option you sold to open, but instead on the order ticket you’d select buy to close. Which would replace the option you sold and you’d be free to move on.

901,ABC," Well yeah if your strike is 55 and the stock is trading at 60 you’re 5 dollars in the money, meaning you’re right to buy at 55 is giving immediate value of 5 a share, you know? That would make the options worth probably 5 per share minimum, plus the other factors which price options like time/volatility. 

Covered calls are great if your goals are aligned. What’s worth it or not is each investors opinion. So I can’t say. 

What I’ll say in my opinion is covered calls are a great strategy for a high yielding portfolio if your goal is to yield 6-10 percent in a lower risk type way. You won’t be  owning many multibaggers this way but you can yield solid. By selling covered calls on dividend paying stocks at slightly higher strikes than you own you can guarantee either yield, or capital gains. If ABC pays 4 percent, and you periodically sell covered calls, and collect the option premium, you’ll get to collect the premium and dividend, and if the yield is 4 percent, you can collect 4 percent in option premium, which would be a yield of 8 percent. If the shares get called away and sold at the strike, by choosing a strike that’s a bit slightly higher you may get called but maybe at a 6 percent gain, which can be redeployed into more similar stocks. The key is finding good safe ones, not ones that could collapse 60 percent, as in a fad company running out of steam, 

 That’s kind of the strategy with covered calls really I think you want to employ.",castor_troy24,5,/r/stocks/comments/oatpyr/question_about_coveted_calls/h3jnwrm/,0.053,0.786,0.162,0.9782
