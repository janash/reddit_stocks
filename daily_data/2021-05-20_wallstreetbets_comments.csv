42,IRS," > Do Americans have to manually work out how much they have to pay?

For day job income, no.  But with investing, if you realize a gain in the short term, it's taxed at your nominal rate.  Some folks, not being aware of this, will take all the gains from a single big YOLO, and spend it on additional investments, a home, lambo, etc.  The following year at tax reporting time, the IRS says ""hey based on how much you made last year, you either owe us more or we owe you.""  If they're a standard W2 employee, taxes are automatically deducted from one's paycheck so that come tax time, they aren't manually figuring out tax amounts owed from their job.  However with a large YOLO gain like this, no taxes are automatically deducted.  That gain will be reported to the IRS by one's brokerage as is standard, and during tax prep time, you have to report all your investment gains/losses.  Those investment gains/losses are added to your day job income, and that final number (minus any deductions) is the amount you will pay taxes on.  

All this to say, if you're not holding back some additional cash to pay the capital gains tax on a yolo gain like this, you're going to be in for a surprise come tax time the following year.",NewPairOfShoes,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ngl64i/yolo_8k_into_spy_puts_yesterday_and_sold_this/gytiggw/,0.035,0.785,0.18,0.9909

44,FOR," >  and spend it on additional investments,

This is not actually a problem. If OP reinvests this money and loses it all, he will not owe anything on taxes. In fact, he'll get a deduction since he lost his initial investment as well.  

If OP reinvests this money and wins more, then he will have more to be taxed and more to pay it with.  

It becomes a problem if he continues high rolling 'til the end of the fiscal year and then the next fiscal year comes, he YOLOs and loses it all, and now he can't pay taxes on _this year's_ winnings because it he lost it _next year_.

68,UWMC," That should work, and you probably won't have to buy as many as you think. During Monday's rally it was only about 15k shares of excess volume that drove the price up by about .50. So to cover the 1.76 you need to break even you only need to buy around 52,000 shares for about $437,000. But realistically if you put in a big order it will most likely start a rally so I bet on the low end you could buy half that many split up a bit and still break even. So best case you are only buying 26k shares for around $219,000.

So for the low, low price of a quarter to a half million dollars you can save yourself 14 grand.

Unlike stock, if you just buy options, you can at least limit your downside without having a stop loss that can get triggered and then the stock rockets without you.  


Selling options is a bit more tricky.  


OTOH you can't YOLO stock.  Like if I buy $100k of TSLA - it tanks, down 30%.  I still have $70k.  Of course I could use margin, but I'll keep getting margin called as it goes down, limiting my losses.  


Instead I buy $100k of calls, it tanks, I lose $100k.

77,UWMC," u/The-Protomolecule

I'm tagging you to add some bear points, and then counter those points with the bull thesis:

Bears say:

1) GOS is suffering huge compression due to companies trying to net volume and the RKT-UWMC price war. UWMC is guiding for Gain on Sale of between .75%-1.15% which is a very significant decrease from Q4 2020 or even Q1 2021.

2) Refinance is slowing down due to higher interest rates.

Bulls Counter:

1) GOS nosediving after booming is natural as it's cyclical. People want to retain as much volume as possible. However, it then goes back to its historical medium of between 1.15%-1.85%.

2) Even at 75BPS, the company is profitable.

3) MSR's value should rise as interest rates rise, and can go high enough to cover expenses for the company as well as the dividend. 

4) They are lowering margin to acquire market share instead of doing acquisitions because it's cheaper for them and more efficient. Other companies don't have the systems they do, and UWMC's systems are the best in class.

5) Interest Rates are still the lowest they've ever been and below 2019. It's only ever been lower last year. 

6) They are purchase oriented, and have been except for 2020. 2018 and 2019 were more purchase heavy than refinance heavy. They also do better in a higher interest rate environment, because they can offer mortgage rates at roughly 15 BPS lower, and as they margin expand through technology it will increase. Home purchases are also complicated while refinance isn't, so time to close is heavily important. They are more than 2.3x faster than anyone else.",Hani95,10,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ngzq1l/uwmc_dd_sizzle_and_steak/gyujj67/,0.052,0.787,0.161,0.9831

289,RIDE," I'm not bearish overall on $RIDE, but my long-term outlook on the brand is being weighed down by the incredible surge of hype around the F150 Lightning.   


I think it's already priced in for Ford, the only way that will cause a surge on their end will be if fleet sales go in an unexpected direction. Which I don't think they will. Because that's what unexpected means.   


However, I do see that hype as deflating RIDE a little bit.   


I got out yesterday with like a hundred bucks' profit. I got in late April for around $9/share for like $300 invested.   
Rule of three. If something's been going well for you three days in a row, consider taking profit.   


I'm not even pretending there was anything more to it than a superstitious impulse. No math, no logic, no patterns. I just felt like it was about to go the other way because it had gone the green direction for too long.

As far as working product, that will be addressed with an update on betas during the next earnings call. Given the recent announcement everything is trending up as expected.

297,GM," There is an SEC investigation that likely lead to the week delay in earnings from 5/17 to 5/24. Obviously if it had merit that wouldn't be good, but I think it's highly unlikely. Ride has been floating with the EV market for the last 6 months - nobody manipulated anything aside from the money flowing into SPACs in general.

The lawsuits that have been plaguing the news ticker for the last month are complete fairy tales when it comes to their claims about production and the battery fire. If you look into the engineering and current factory and beta status at all it's obviously bullshit and came from analysts that have no interest in understanding EV engineering. They just wanted a convenient target which worked out nicely for them. Now the claim about pre-orders has more teeth, but it's honestly pretty weak as a basis for any actual fraud and isn't exactly a new or novel development in the sector.

The riskiest thing about this is the fact that it's speculative EV on a deadline for production. The engineering and manufacturing risks are very real and it's going to be a serious challenge to meet deadlines and compete in the coming markets. But lawsuits? I'm not even slightly worried (which is why I intentionally used the lawsuits to invest when the price was held down)

Normally, I wouldn't even invest in speculative EV as I don't trust the industry. But in this case I think the ties to GM, Elaphe, and Camping World combined with the logistical and financial valuation of their current factory set-up gives them a significant leg up.",neutrino64575,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ngkfy8/ride_the_train_is_leaving_the_station/gys2lc7/,0.142,0.76,0.098,-0.928

322,AMC," People are counting on theaters bouncing back in a huge way as the reopening continues throughout the US. Releases have been delayed for some big movies which *may* bridge the gap as production catches up. 

AMC is the largest theater chain and is currently undervalued compared to its competitors (Regal and Cinemark). I think a squeeze is unlikely but it will climb. How long that climb is sustainable is yet to be seen. I don't have faith in AMC leadership (like you said, not a great stock from the start) and the pandemic has really expedited alternative distribution methods that I don't see going away. If AMC positions itself to be more than just a theater but a large-screen venue they could see a boost.

Things are open and there has been a very meager bump but theaters largely rely on the exclusive distribution of movies to get people in to buy their stuff. The model isn't great long-term and while a lot of people are eager to get back into theaters, there will be a trickle of movies and I believe streaming will really eat into their share. Theaters aren't dead but they aren't a spry young thing either.

394,AMC," #FUCK AMC

What really, truly bothers me is that most meme stocks, even *squeeze meme* stocks, have a bullish case to be made. Not all are likely, but many are feasible.

They have either eliminated debt, or are in line for a huge contract, or have a recovery plan to help them shed COVID inertia.

But AMC doesn't. It's propped up by a bunch of Occupy Wall Street wannabes who want to eat the rich.

AFTER their board sold even more shares to give themselves over $8 million in bonuses for ""extraordinary efforts"" during the pandemic... this company still trades higher than almost ever, with more shares than ever, and their CEO will make another offering as soon as he thinks the company's image can take it.


This shit was $6 and AMC was on the verge of bankruptcy before the virus.

My biggest concern deals with the privacy issues surrounding ad-tech, in particular these sorts of programmatic advertising companies.

Having said that, this company recently filed an S-3 Shelf Registration Statement with the SEC to sell $350M of stock at the market price, whenever they choose.  So your position is about to, if not already, get seriously diluted.  When they filed, it was trading at $9.  Now it's $5.xx.  So assuming an average of $7, that's 50 million new shares being issued.

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001411690/000114036121009770/nt10022040x1\_424b5.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001411690/000114036121009770/nt10022040x1_424b5.htm)

This is in addition to the 29M shares they issued in January. 

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001411690/000114036121000735/nt10018741x4\_424b5.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001411690/000114036121000735/nt10018741x4_424b5.htm)

So this company has shown a proclivity to issue new shares as they need to refill their coffers at the expense of the shareholders.  I'm not sure I would like being constantly diluted every time they need money.

Right now they have a market cap of $1.5B on $10M of TTM revenue, -$40M of TTM net income, and -$153M of accumulated deficit.

So, that's a hard pass from me.",Defiant_Chemistry966,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nh6256/bngo_is_his_name_o/gyuv4m8/,0.051,0.899,0.049,-0.0855

600,RH," Very likely to end in the ‘Winners Curse’. That is if you get an allocation you don’t actually want it. All the real players have passed. 

It’s hard to get an allocation even on platforms that are owned (E*TRADE == Morgan Stanley) or have strong ties (Fidelity == Credit Suisse) to lead book runners. 

They also want those who are allocated shares to hold them for some period of time, not flip them the day it begins trading. E*TRADE for example tracks its 30 days and may exclude you from future allocations if you consistently dump before then. Given the normal RH client… I can see BAML leads using RH as a dumping ground for bad deals.",JackWolfbanger,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nh57oi/robinhood_to_allow_users_to_buy_into_ipos/gyuph03/,0.092,0.824,0.084,-0.25

603,BNGO," That’s a lot of capital tied up for a long time to make $400.   If you want to sell covered calls then maybe look at 45-90 dte and roll them out if it hits sooner.   There’s nothing wrong with your strategy per se, but it’s not going to be very efficient in terms of capital usage.   It’s a safe play though and you’re locking in 10% returns at minimum.

I’ve been selling a block of puts on BNGO every time it dips under $5 and it’s done well so far, buying them back when it gets into higher $5’s - the lower support seems to be mid $4’s and $~5.15 with resistance in the high $5’s lately. it could go lower for sure, I’m fine with holding BNGO long term and see the hard floor around mid $3 right now.",rgar132,10,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nh8q8x/my_first_time_playing_around_with_options_using/gyuvxdi/,0.07,0.77,0.16,0.9234
