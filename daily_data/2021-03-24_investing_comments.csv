1,AMD," Unpopular opinion: very few are qualified or otherwise have an ""edge"" when it comes to evaluating Intel vs. TSMC. $20 billion means nothing if engineering is not able to execute. This [article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chips-political-moment-will-need-to-last-11614769382) points out that Intel's R&D spend is 6x that of TSMC (yes, not entirely apples to apples as Intel has more product lines). Semiconductor manufacturing is super technical, even companies like Google/Facebook are easier to evaluate on a technical level.

If you're just investing off the news, then IMO you should just buy both (and AMD, Nvidia, etc.): that way you are betting on the semiconductor market as a whole.

14,AMD," I'm loving this. Intel is at such a low point that any news of anything would push the stock higher.

Intel had a brand name worth protecting, capacity to take on small and large projects, and leadership in an industry with not a lot of players. They overlooked Apple when they asked them for help, and overlooked 10nm and 7nm delays. Meanwhile, AMD used the exact same method Intel used to dominate the market and the method Richard Branson uses: To dominate a market as a small player, enter with low level products and slowly build yourself. Target the high end product when your competitor can no longer respond aggressively because you've grown large enough in the market.

They pissed away their strengths and got lazy. Now we're supposed to believe they can execute? Fine, I'll bite. Let's say that Intel does get 7nm ready in 2023. No hiccups, excellent performance, excellent yields right? Are we also supposed to ignore that Samsung and TSMC are both building manufacturing factories in the US near Intel? Let's say both of them somehow hit a major hiccup and don't grow until 2023, they'll still be on 5nm, a size smaller than what Intel can offer.

All of the above is a big IFF, and even then they'll be behind. Their marketing screams ""I NEED HELP"" they operate like a company from the 90s. Using old technology in laptops, doing bullshit comparisons against Apples M1, and most tech YouTubers are calling them out.

I'll clarify the writing on the wall for you:

- Intel = Manufacturing jobs in the US in the past

- TSMC/Samsung = Similar to being in software jobs today


Which one do you wanna hold?

Until then, this bearishness on AMD is creating a great opportunity to invest, since they're likely to have incredible growth in the server marker like they've never had before. 

2021 and 2022 will more than likely still favor AMD, since like Intel cant poop out any competetive projects in the foreseeable future. Just a couple factories they're starting to build.

I'm looking forward for an Intel dip later this year when the excitement cant be stretched out until they do something worth while again

68,AMD," It is both sad and satisfying to see Intel in this situation.

I was a CPU designer during the ""processor wars"" of the 1990s.  There were so many alternatives to Intel back then that were architecturally superior.  MIPS, SPARC, Alpha, PA-RISC, all of those were fundamentally better designs.

The reason Intel was the last man standing wasn't their CPU architecture. The installed base of Windows software helped but that wasn't decisive either. It was their world-class fabs that made Intel win the processor wars. It didn't matter how good all the other designs were if Intel could manufacture at a process node one to two generations ahead of everybody else.

In my opinion Intel got fat and lazy. They owned the market for desktop and servers and didn't feel like they needed to keep their fabs up to date.

106,GDP," I agree with inflation in housing. We have been seeing an artificial supply demand imbalance. New cheap money, low rates drive up assets prices. The wealthy with more money than they know what to do with so assets are being bought. The decline in the dollar alone can cause a certain amount of asset inflation. Food is one of the things I’m talking about, costs like high oil and wages gets passed on as a last resort. To pass on costs or offset lost sales. We see slow steady rise there but not real inflation. As for electronics. We see newer and better things coming out year after year at the same or lower prices. Electronics have seen nothing but deflation measured against our currency. A 65” flat screen would have cost you $6000 dollars ten years ago, now you can get a better one for 600. We’ve continued to see inflation at a nominal GDP growth, but we haven’t seen real inflation for decades in everyday goods.

110,AI," Good list of almost every financial bubble today. You left out EVs and genomic though.

The nice thing about financial bubbles though are that they help companies raise cash and in turn lend a helping hand to the innovation. In other words they are good for society, for employees and founders of said companies. 

The bad news is the common investor chasing those bubbles tend to fare pretty badly. See anyone that invested in a tech-focused fund in 1999, you'd have been better off just long in UP (a literal railroad stock).

How do you know whether it's a bubble or not? Here's the hint...look at the revenue growth percentage (forward expectations plus backward). Now look at stock price growth. If the later is moving significantly faster than the former...well... How about this analogy for you... If you have a 50% growth in AI engineers a year in New York, but only a 10% annual growth in population...then eventually you'll have more AI engineers than people! 

Have you considered identifying sectors that actually will benefit from these revolutionary changes, rather than chasing the innovation itself?

118,IMO," A fun list. Hopefully we can add to it as time goes on. I think some of these sectors are still just getting started, so a lot of the best companies remain private. They dont want to be apart of the SPAC madness and they have plenty of ways to raise money privately. 

I think the talk of a bubble is reasonable. A lot of companies have been hot and seen huge interest. It is also a numbers game. To the point I made above, if x number of people are interested in a sector, but only 2 or 3 companies are publicly traded in that area, those companies will explode. As time goes on, you hope to see more companies coming public which will cool off the first companies to go public and better satisfy investor demand. 

The main differences between now and 1999 Bubble is interest rates and diversity of tech companies. In 1999, I think you could get a 5% risk-free yield. You get a fraction of that today. It was much easier to sell your stocks and go into bonds back then than it is now. Also, a lot of the tech titans in today's market have huge moots and good balance sheets. Some companies were in good shape back in 1999/2000, but I think it is tough to compare any to the titans of today. But no doubt in a list of 10 high growth/high valuation stocks, maybe 1-3 actually become highly successful long term. 

Of your list, I like cybersecurity and semiconductors. I like 3D printing, but I think the better play might be industries that will largely benefit from 3D printing.

Microsoft, Google, Twitter, Facebook are selling products. Microsoft literally so, with the others the consumer is the product.

Amazon is a beast of its own and may continue to cannibalize the world.

Renewables (batteries) and semiconductors/chips are also commoditizable...again not as good a business as a Google.

140,GDP," It falls 5-10% over the course of about a week, and then continues upward. Higher highs and higher lows over the last couple of months.

Yes, GDP growth tends to favor small caps, which is part of it being a new bull market. As I commented to someone else below, the Feb/March 2020 drawdown was technically the fastest bear market in history, and given that most bull markets last 3-5 years, that would mean that we're near the beginning of a new one.

That said, the last couple of months have seen a big rotation from large to mid and small caps and from growth to value and I see no reason why it wouldn't continue in the medium term. Not to mention we still haven't seen a full reopening or even this huge rush of stimulus money into the market (or economy) that everyone has been expecting.

Finally--and I didn't mention this in the post--small size is [one of the factors in factor investing](https://youtu.be/ViTnIebSzj4) that explains excess returns. Small stocks tend to outperform large stocks over time. And to be fair, I've been hearing people say that we're in a bubble that's about to pop for a year and it hasn't panned out.",z74al,4,/r/investing/comments/mbpykh/dip_buyers_its_a_good_time_to_get_into_small_caps/gs0k7g0/,0.018,0.893,0.089,0.929
141,OR," I recently saw a recommendation thread about a finance app and just thought I would share my most commonly used apps in that it may help someone else.  Of course, everyone has different needs and features they like but maybe the list will help a few people explore ideas.

Just a note, I'm a Canadian.  I bank with TD and trade on Questrade but also have some market holdings spread across three other accounts (or my wife does).  I'm a computer nerd and have looked at a lot of different options in the finance space.

**Budget and consolidated financials**: [Pocketsmith](https://www.pocketsmith.com/).  I also have Mint but have mostly abandoned it in favour of Pocketsmith.  I prefer the interface and the way I can tag and manage categories.  It has a nice budgeting feature though I don't really use it now.  I can consolidate my assets and liabilities and track where I'm at overall.  I can save custom searches which is useful for things I use often.  I can also quickly look up historical transactions easily, even things that are many years old (TD doesn't let me go back indefinitely).  *PAID*

**Trading**: [Questrade](https://www.questrade.com/home). I don't log in unless I'm making trades which is not daily.  I like the platform overall, no issues so far.  I use the online chat feature to discuss questions in real-time, though the there can be a wait.  *PAID (per trade)*

**Daily portfolio monitoring**: [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).  A lot of great features here and I have tried more apps of this type than any other.  I stick with Yahoo as I haven't found anything better.  I have an extensive watchlist but my holdings are manually sorted to the top of the list.  At a glance I can see the current real-time price, change etc.  The ""My Holdings"" view has more detail if needed, and I even have my own custom view if I want more data.  I often sort by ""Chg %"" to see the biggest gainers/losers for the day to see if anything drastic is happening.  It has a consolidated news for my watchlist, and financial details for everything as well.  My favorite research tool and the app I use the most.  Great iOS app as well, with notifications so everything is synched and easy to manage.  *FREE*

**Long term portfolio tracking**: [Wealthica](https://wealthica.com/).  Really nice portfolio visualization and tracking tool.  It allows me to link my various accounts (Questrade, etc.) and imports all transactions.  Think Mint for your investments.  I have my wife's accounts grouped differently so I can see consolidated view, just mine or hers, or individual accounts to see how things are doing.  *FREE*

**Portfolio analysis & planning:** [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/).  I have a custom google sheet that heavily uses the [GOOGLEFINANCE](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093281?hl=en) function to pull in market data.  I have my holdings listed, along with a bunch of breakdowns: stock/etf/mututal fund/cash  OR RRSP/TFSA/Open, etc.  Once all the tagging is done, I have graphs that show me how my overall portfolio is structured based on various criteria and it updates in near real-time.  I also use this sheet to plan my investments, and it allows me try various scenarios.  For example, I deposited $6000 into my TFSA in January, how should I allocate that money, how many shares of each item can I buy (based on current price) and how does my portfolio look after those trades, etc.  I can then use those numbers to plug trades into Questrade.  I have yet to find an app that does everything I want it to in the same way so essentially I had to write my own.  I have a dashboard summary tab with a bunch of charts presented exactly the way I want.  If you can't find the right tool elsewhere, I recommend you check out.  I don't trade a lot so manual update of this sheet is good for me.  If you trade a lot, there is a [paid option in Wealthica](https://wealthica.com/blog/add-ons-google-sheets-export-opening-wealthica-3rd-party-developers/) that will link it to Sheets.

In the morning of Wednesday, March 24th at 9:30 AM, if my BID was within the range of the Bid-Ask spread, there's a great chance that my order would execute, and I'm the owner of a relatively cheap Call Option for a stock who's price increased by 6.6% but who's underlying option doesn't reflect this increase.

172,NIO," I cannot believe I missed this one as an investor in Tesla!!

LK's share price has gone 22.5x since July 2020.

They are the parent company of Italian company who have supplied the European Giga presses, and LK itself supplied the Giga Shanghai Giga press.

Do you think they will still be a great investment at this share price?

+ves: 
they are supplying cutting edge machinery to arguably the most cutting edge company in the world, Tesla.

NIO is also a very good EV company, based in China, so nationalism suggests NIO would use LK as well and copy Tesla's die casting methodology.

The incumbent OEMs that are going to survive are going to need to copy Tesla, so I think sooner or later they'll copy the die casting. I think some of these OEMs will use LK


-ves
Revenue before the huge share price increase is around $400 million per year.

At 22.5x share price, how many Giga presses do they need to sell to justify the current share price?

I've enquired about the purchase price of the Giga press today.

If you said a Giga press was $100 million to buy, that's 90 Giga presses for revenue to 22.5x.

177,ATH," The general downtown in growth tech isn't being driven by Powell. Yes, they're most sensitive to his remarks, but that's a relatively small factor.

They're being pushed down for two main reasons, IMO (I don't think anyone will find this controversial unless they're a tech evangelist who bristles at any critique of Cathie & Co)

1. ""Growth"" is made up largely of tech, and tech is made up in large part by companies that don't actually turn a bottom-line profit, operate with free cash flow, or create operating profits. Their valuation is based on the promise of future cash flows, and investors have to judge how much they want to discount them (given that they're unrealized and risky). Here's the problem: these companies burn through money like it's going out of style. R&D, fancy backlighting for the office, indulging the quirky CEO's quirkiness, etc. Fundamentally, they need cheap debt to allow for runway since they're operating at a net loss. Anything that threatens the availability or purchasing power of debt is a threat to the company, and investors will factor that into their discount rate. 
2. Borrowing rates and easy money concerns aside, tech is broadly overvalued and overbought. Retail has gone absolutely nuts on tech this year, and the newer the money into the market, the more tech-heavy their portfolio. This is anecdotal but I'd happily place a wager on it; the posts you see here about people being down 80% YTD or some insane number are driven almost entirely by a portfolio that considers TSLA a value buy at 10% off ATH. WSB buys tech after a dip literally by rule. Tech share pricing has become completely detached from value and the drawdown in that sector is 100% healthy. It hurts, but it's needed in a bloated market.

Is bailing on tech smart? IDK, I'm the guy with almost zero tech exposure since January and still lost 5% yesterday (today looks like garbage as well!), so grain of salt here.

186,AMC," > Can I exercise it now or should I wait?

Puts work like this.

Person A (you) buys the put from Person B. Person A has the right to sell 100 shares to Person B at $9.50 price. Executing the Put means you're forcing Person B to buy the shares right now. 

For Puts/Calls you can Write (create), Buy (take ownership), Sell (trade ownership to someone else), Execute (act on them).

If you don't have 100 shares, you can't really execute a Put. You can sell it, if that's what you mean (it might have pretty good value now that it's in the money or close to it), or if you have 100 shares you could just...sell them. The Put only has any worth using if the price falls even further below (say to $7/share - at which point you can still force someone (assigned by the exchange - see comment below) who wrote a Put to buy your shares at $9.50). You can technically exercise a Call/Put at any time before the expiration, it just doesn't make sense to do so in some cases (for example, AMC at $12 you could still force someone to buy your shares at $9.50...but why would you?). 

So I'm not quite sure what you're asking here - if you have the shares, you could just sell them now at $9.50 if you wanted, or if the price dips even further you can still sell at $9.50 and even immediately turn around and reinvest at a lower cost basis if you wanted to.",Downside_Up_,3,/r/investing/comments/mc16go/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gs2zvcq/,0.017,0.875,0.109,0.9651

215,IMO," I thought of two things that could be causing that: as with all options, 1) theta decay is going to wreck the value of your options if the stock’s price doesn’t rise significantly before the expiry date. But you mentioned that that’s not until September, so I doubt it’s having that much of an effect.

IMO, the problem right now is that 2) established investors seem to be shying away from riskier plays right now. They’re buying up S&P companies because they’re safe — that’s why it’s going up — but they’re avoiding riskier shorter-term plays like options, even in a stable market. On the flip side, it’s probably a good time to buy!

I definitely feel your pain right now as far as options go though. I have the rare quadruple downturn doozy: 1) options in 2) a NASDAQ/tech stock, in 3) a more speculative sector (EV), 4) of a SPAC (which don’t really have the best image atm). It’s safe to say they’re not looking too hot right now, but on the “bright side” I’ve already lost nearly 66% of their original value so they can’t hurt me for too much longer lol. 

That, and I could buy more for dirt cheap, which is nice. I’m very long on the company and am confident that they’ll turn around when the company goes through with its Q2 merger, but oof they hurt real bad right now.",maledin,2,/r/investing/comments/mc16go/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gs3g88w/,0.148,0.675,0.177,0.8572

217,SOL," For a regular retail investor, what's the best way to protect yourself from violent price swings during after-hours trading?  I have a small ""gambling"" account that's fun to play with to try to time spikes in volatile stocks.  Just yesterday a position held mostly flat, somewhat down throughout the entire trading day, and then (thankfully) spiked up over 100% in after-hours trading.  This was great, but then it went 50% back down during pre-market trading, and there was no opportunity to take that profit between the up and down. 

Is there a way to protect against this, or set limits that will actually work during off hours, or are retail shareholders just SOL on that front?",emperorko,2,/r/investing/comments/mc15v0/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gs2vm0w/,0.041,0.787,0.172,0.9419

I should mention this is predomenidately on the stock that shall not be named.

260,AAPL," Hello all,

What are your thoughts on continued pullback/volatility in NASDAQ/Tech? Additionally, would welcome your comments/thoughts on my portfolio.

So I do not want to sound like a complete whiner and I am not a penny flipper or even day trader. I am just curious what are some of the reasons behind the continued pullback (about 6 weeks now) in tech. I have read everything from reasonable stuff like (1) money shifting over to reopening stock (2) investors made a ton of money on tech last year and are taking profit for taxes (3) Bond Market/Inflation worries to not so reasonable (4) Market Manipulation (big boys/tutes want your shares cheap) and (5) recession is around the corner just because we are overdue for one.

I know at least some of you are suffering with me in this pullback so may be I'm looking for group discussion or perhaps even consolation. Any thoughts or ideas (especially on the stuff coming up on expiration this summer) are welcomed.

Thank you all in advance.

264,NET," Hello all,

What are your thoughts on continued pullback/volatility in NASDAQ/Tech? Additionally, would welcome your comments/thoughts on my portfolio.

So I do not want to sound like a complete whiner and I am not a penny flipper or even day trader. I am just curious what are some of the reasons behind the continued pullback (about 6 weeks now) in tech. I have read everything from reasonable stuff like (1) money shifting over to reopening stock (2) investors made a ton of money on tech last year and are taking profit for taxes (3) Bond Market/Inflation worries to not so reasonable (4) Market Manipulation (big boys/tutes want your shares cheap) and (5) recession is around the corner just because we are overdue for one.

I know at least some of you are suffering with me in this pullback so may be I'm looking for group discussion or perhaps even consolation. Any thoughts or ideas (especially on the stuff coming up on expiration this summer) are welcomed.

Thank you all in advance.

273,GME," Theoretically, sure, but practically, no. Growth trades at premium and value traded at discount. In your example it’s simply an “undervalued” stock, not a “value” or “deep value” stock. It’s impossible that a company can be growing its top line business significantly while simultaneously be undervalued at a book level. I can’t think of any business I’ve ever looked at or heard of which is growing 15, 30, 50, 100% sales year over year, but still being valued below their book value, which is traditionally how normal value investing is defined. Deep value generally means that you can buy a company so cheap, that you can possibly liquidate and wind up the company at the current price, at any time, and still make money, all the while factoring in a control premium.

Good examples of this happening are Warren Buffett’s early railroad investments, where he purchased companies because their value on the book (land that they paid for) was priced on their balance sheet at a significant discount to their market value, since the land was acquired in the 1800s/1900s and weren’t re-valued since. Think “deep value” like going to different yard sales to try and buy extremely rare Pokémon or Yugioh cards from boomer families getting rid of their kids’ possessions, except apply it to companies potentially worth billions. 

Even with GME, the most obvious and possibly relevant example, the original thesis was based more so on the undervalued play than the growth play. There’s no growth factor to the stock at the moment beyond the fact that

280,DCF," I think you’re on the right track in thinking about which sectors you think will outperform and which companies are best positioned in those sectors to succeed.

Saying that, when it comes to choosing a stock to invest in, ultimately the best company in the world may still underperform the market if the valuation is too high. 

So valuation comes into play to help to pick stocks will outperform the market.

That’s the one, discounted cash flows (currently studying about them at university, just forgot the full term lol), we’re about to enter the part where we learn about estimating the IRR, but I still don’t see how I could apply that without some more info about the company (for this one there wasn’t that much info when it comes to cash flows, or info that I could find at least). 

I didn’t consider ROA because I assumed this company wouldn’t be making much from their NCA’s, and IIRC, advertising is a little bit icky when it comes to certain ratio’d, I may be wrong though.
