If Microsoft can give players free access to their game pass games and also sell new games they’ll be in a much better position than Google. Have you ever looked at the free games on stadia? Most of them were garbage.

I Actually prefer the Stadia business model. I have 86 games I have gotten for free by subscribing, and any games I purchase are mine to play without a subscription...for free after the price of the game. Its a free console, and I don't have to pay a monthly fee if I don't want to.   


The way I play games the ""Netflix"" model doesn't make sense to me. I don't want to log on to a service to play a game that may disappear before I'm done with it.   


Regardless goodbye to your expensive boxes. I will gladly pay each of the big companies to play their exclusives. Streaming is the way I want to play moving forward, but I loathe the idea of a cable like subscription model. If MS doesn't want ownership then I will continue to occasionally subscribe to play their first party games.

26,TV," Yep. I used to be a non-believer in game streaming. I used to think latency lag would be impossible to get over but now I think it could work. It already works in many cases.

I have a gaming desktop at home. I wanted to play some PC games on my TV, so I tried NVidia GameStream and Steam Link. My client and server were using the same local network, hard-wired to the same gigabit switch, and it worked like shit. Input lag was impossible to get used to. Even non-twitchy games felt very uncomfortable and difficult to play. If input lag was unacceptably high even when streaming from a server in the same LAN in the same room, how can input lag when streaming from a remote server ever get to a usable state?

Then one day I randomly decided to try out NVidia GeforceNow's free trial. I had no expectations considering NVidia's GameStream did not work well for me, but GeforceNow somehow worked so much better. I played twitchy games like Counter-Strike ranked and did well. There were times that I forgot I was even streaming games. It felt almost exactly like playing local. If there was lag, it was imperceptible to me, an avid FPS and Starcraft (diamond) player.

So, not sure what I did wrong with using GameStream/SteamLink and its obvious that game streaming still has a long way to go, but it's pretty clear to me that game streaming has improved much more compared to what it was during the days of OnLive.",nioformio,1,/r/stocks/comments/nws8lb/microsoft_is_developing_new_hardware_to_bring_its/h1bvmxm/,0.136,0.71,0.154,0.7565

28,GME," I work with some guys who recently took redundancy from RR.

From what they say, apparently Rolls do not make any money on selling their engines (once you include R&D costs etc), and so the majority of their profits come with the servicings plans that go with them.

Engines have to be serviced X amount of flying hours. Because of Corona, what's been happening is when a aircraft reaches those hours, rather than paying to get it serviced (because the airlines are tight on cash too), they just ground the aircraft and use the hours up on the next one, and so on and so forth.

So in theory, once air travel picks up again, there's going to be a huge amount of aircraft needing servicings and therefore more work for rolls and more money coming in.

So yes long term I think it's a good play. As soon as MOASS is done I'm reinvesting a significant amount in to RR. As others have mentioned they are a defense contractor for the military too and are very unlikely to go bankrupt, especially given their joint development and upkeep of the F-35 engine.

I might be wrong in what I'm saying, and I'd be genuinely happy for people to offer critisms!

There may be more willing buyers than sellers or more willing sellers than buyers but there will always the same number of trades/shares/dollars for buys and sells.,imnotgood42,5,/r/stocks/comments/nwtmvj/why_would_price_go_down_if_inflow_is_consistently/h1b4plr/,0.026,0.945,0.029,0.0644
43,ABC," I think you misunderstand inflows / outflows. In reality, there is no money put ""into"" or pulled ""out"" of a stock. There is a buyer and seller in every trades. Money goes from the buyer to the seller. The only thing that determines what is considered ""in"" and ""out"" is whoever is the market maker and whoever is the taker. If there are more inflows than outflows, it just means more buyers are making market buys, while more sellers are using limits / providing liquidity.

For example, I could buy 10 shares of ABC at $10, then turn around and dump the 10 shares for $9. I bough $100 worth and sold $90 worth, but the price went down. But the total money transacted is net 0, $100 from me to the seller, and $90 from the buyer to me.",Squezeplay,1,/r/stocks/comments/nwtmvj/why_would_price_go_down_if_inflow_is_consistently/h1b6hzo/,0.038,0.918,0.044,-0.0129

45,UWMC," The premium is normally per share. For UWMC, premium for a call at a strike of 11 is 0.50. Thats per share. Contracts are for 100 share. So the premium is $50 per contract.

46,CLF, I made a pretty simple python bot that scraped wsb and shows me the mentions of each stock at a given time. After studying it for a bit i’ve concluded that once a meme stock enters the top 4-8 mentioned it has a high chance of running. Yesterday noticed that CLF was number 7 or 8 seemingly out of nowhere so I bought some shares at 22.5. Right now it’s second in mentioned and planning on dumping on open today and looking for the next one.,HereComesTheMoneyyy,19,/r/stocks/comments/nwflpo/with_meme_stocks_becoming_the_new_trend_im/h19t4a4/,0.027,0.845,0.128,0.7553
47,CLF," First - short interest. It doesn't matter if it's gonna ""squeeze"" or not, if the shorts cover or anything else. You play the market not the ""fundamentals"" and the market is full of dumb apes that think ""short interest = moon"" (maybe they think it means how long they have to be interested in the stock, dunno).

Second - meme potential. If there is any catalyst to it, it has potential. I bought into CLF yesterday morning because I saw the wsb post and I saw the yt videos of the CEO berating analysts on calls and I knew there was enough ""meme potential"" behind it. Steel beams, jet fuel, chad CEO. It had all the ""meme fundamentals"".

Last - the options chain. If you really want to make money, you have to find a stock that fits the other two and has an options chain that isn't saturated yet. Call option prices SPIKE in heavy trading volume and you can see this coming to life often at market open. I was looking at deep OTM options for CLF yesterday and the volumes were already halfway to the daily regular volume minutes after market open. I bought in instantly, was 50% up within \~15 minutes and ended the day up 500% on my calls. And they are calls for july that are probably not going to strike but some poor FOMO person is still gonna buy them for a premium..

It's pretty obvious to me (keep in mind I am also a dumb person) that the options chain is the casino where people are trying to make money and the underlying is secondary to it when trading in meme stocks. Sure, you can bag a 50% profit when you buy a stock and it really moons, but the people playing leveraged games on these stocks can be taking 5000% profit in the same timeframe. All of the meme stocks have HUGE volumes on the options chain and if you find one that doesn't, that is the place to jump in. Don't play with deep OTM calls that have already gone up several thousand % for the day because that is the point where you get fucked by implied volatility and even when the price of the underlying has steady but slower gains your contract prices will likely have small growth OR they decay in value due to time/IV drop.

72,CLOV," For those asking about market surge: 
 
I have made a lot of money in just a few months by playing the list of stocks Robinhood restricted back in January, as well as WSB pump and dumps. Some of these stocks have high short interest, but many of them are simply pump and dumps being shilled by bullshit WSB accounts. 
 
The key is pretty simple: spend a LOT of time on Reddit, and get out before the pump dumps. 
 
Here’s how you do it: 
 
So basically, recently WSB has been invaded by shills. The sub has totally changed, and it’s now a pump and dump cesspool. 
 
But you can make good money from it. The key is to constantly browse by new in the EARLY morning EST hours (I’m a night owl on the west coast so I just look around 1AM PST), as well as browsing posts from weeks or months earlier. You should know every single stock being talked about on WSB like the back of your hand. 
 
I’ll use CLOV as an example. Back in March, CLOV was the hot ticket pump stock. It got pumped up to $30 and then dumped, and it bottomed out at around $9, where it stayed for several months. Lots of people were left holding the bag. 
 
But after browsing new on WSB one late night/early morning, I noticed that a bunch of **really sketchy accounts** (less than 1k karma, never invested before but suddenly posting huge YOLOs with the “WSB lingo”) were trying to push CLOV again. 
 
There’s a very specific way they do it: first, very rational, very calm posts appear that talk about why CLOV still has massive potential. (This happened around the end of may). 
 
Then, over the next few days or weeks as the stock rises, the posts get more and more manic — until they’re all in all caps, with huge (photoshopped) “YOLO plays,” DEMANDING that you BUY NOW because it’s GOING TO THE MOON. 
 
When that happens, the stock’s about to get dumped. 
 
But as soon as I saw CLOV posts start to resurface in new, I got in at market open at $9. And just like clockwork, the stock rose like crazy over the course of the next week. 
 
When the manic “all in” posts started being spammed on WSB nonstop, CLOV was at $24, and I got out. Less than 24 hours later, the pump got dumped, and now CLOV is back down to $16 and falling fast. 
 
All in all, it was a one-week play that made me 120%+, which is a fantastic return. And it wasn’t just chance. **The upside of WSB being compromised is that once you figure out how the shills operate, you can make a lot of money.** 
 
Just don’t get greedy. For CLOV, I had a limit sell placed at $25, but then I saw the price going up quickly, so I took it off. Of course, once it got to $27 it started getting dumped, so I lost out on profit by selling at $23 instead of the $25 I had predicted. 
 
Don’t try to go for a home run with pump and dumps. Try to hit a double, and if you can do that consistently, you can make a lot of money due to this broken, fucked-up shill world we live in now.",Nice-Violinist-6395,14,/r/stocks/comments/nwflpo/with_meme_stocks_becoming_the_new_trend_im/h1bcmt9/,0.094,0.817,0.088,-0.6797

I have some SHOP that's currently trading at around $1228 today and I think I'm [following the instructions to a T](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1PiUOgiYk) by finding and buying a deep in-the-money call about roughly two months out with a delta of \~0.95 and selling an out of money call a couple of weeks out. 

But the problem is the price of the buy call option with a 0.95 delta is ridiculously high ($273) that no out of money sell price will break even (for my example, I put 1270, which is selling at $11. So in the end, the spread price comes out to -$262. Here's a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/kuv3Zha) of what I did. I thought the thinking behind the poor man's covered call was that you make less than if you sold a covered call but you don't quite have 100 shares.

There's a world where someone sold a portfolio sensitive to rate raises.

They saved themselves plenty of money and missed out on what, a below average day for the broader market? 

For the record I'm not into those type of stocks to begin with, but conceptually holding up a day where the inflation sensitive stocks tank, the rest of the market is broadly albeit barely positive as proof that ""timing"" doesn't work is sort of silly.

205,FSLY," Some of the share price ups and downs over the last year have been a result of various happenings. Here's some background of those.

FSLY has best of breed technology. When pandemic started, they had instant, perfect solutions for the sudden surge in demand.  Along the same timeline, one of their customers, Tiktok, exploded in popularity and usage.  

Then there was a Trump campaign rally in which Tiktok users banded together to request tickets, creating a fake impression that hundreds of thousands of MAGAs were coming, but the true demand was only a few thousand, leaving empty grandstands.  Embarrassed, Trump waged war on Tiktok, threatening to ban it if they didn't sell the company to American interests, ultimately those being family of the Walmart fortune.  

As tiktok's primary supplier, Fastly was seen as potentially taking a hit from such a ban.  Would they lose some of Tiktok's business?  And for how long?

While his ban threat was playing out, tiktok's Chinese owners found a way to copy or replace the web serving functions of Fastly.  In a surprising quarterly announcement, Fastly revealed that they had lost 100% of the business of their largest customer, TikTok, and that loss would be permanent.  It was the worst case scenario.  Trump's weird personal vendetta had only resulted in harm to an American company, Fastly, and actually benefitted Tiktok.  

Fastly would go on to reveal high demand from other customers that might make up for the loss of Tiktok.  And they also announced some of the most advanced technology in the CDN industry.  

One knock against FSLY had been regarding security, but Fastly acquired and integrated a security company which handled that objection and gave them additional revenue streams.  

Fastly has been revealed to have a low customer count, but the customers they do have are major entities who rely on them heavily.  There have been rumors that some tech megacap might like to buy them.  

Since their fortunes did rise with the work/study from home trend, there's some assumption their business could revert as the pandemic retreats.  Their high multiple also made them vulnerable to rising interest rate corrections.",Summebride,3,/r/stocks/comments/nwjei1/rstocks_daily_discussion_options_trading_thursday/h1ato7g/,0.169,0.727,0.104,-0.9869

What's stopping me investing at the moment is the massively risen cost of shipment that has happened. I have a few orders from alibaba that haven't even been shipped from China yet and I believe that this is why.

The main thing that Baba has going for it is that it ships things that are so cheap compared to the goods you could otherwise buy.

The problem is if their shipping costs run up massively and stay high they may not longer maintain this competitive advantage.

Target has the suburban wife/mom/family on lock down, especially here in the Midwest.  People will drive further to go to Target over Walmart.

The best advice I’ve been given is know your investment.  If you believe the company you have invested in has strong fundamentals and a good chance of success in future, hold it and don’t worry too much about short term volatility.

That being said, definitely a good idea to balance between safer index funds and ETFs (I like VTI personally) as well as individual stocks.

405,RH," Depends on the type of stocks you’re wanting to buy. 

Pure hype? Check Reddit and social media (be prepared to get burned if this is you tho) 

Value? Look up dividend aristocrats and start there. 

Growth? Honestly idk, I’m not much of a growth investor aside from a few companies I know from my personal life which allowed me to apply the investing strategy of “well I like this product and it’s hard for me to get so they must be doing decent sells, let me read more up on them”

Disclosure: I started investing the end of January 2021, and I’m up over $500  combined between my new Roth IRA and my RobinHood account ($400 up in the growth focused RH account and $100+ up in the Roth IRA not counting dividends)

Honestly YouTube is a huge help. Look up the genZinvestor on YouTube for a good sample platter of value and growth stocks.",TheFondestComb,2,/r/stocks/comments/nwt4ww/should_i_expect_to_lose_money_the_first_year/h1b868c/,0.055,0.776,0.169,0.9612

415,TA," TA is not fake, if for the simple fact that so many people use it. This legitimizes it and it’s effects. Algorithms and humans are paying attention to TA and executing orders based on it.
