6,TWTR," People laughed at me when I said this a few months ago. I thought it was overvalued at $45 and I still think it's way overvalued at that. It's to Facebook what Yahoo was to google. It will survive for years to come in it's little ""breaking news"" niche, but the days of growth are long over. 

The valuation is quite ridiculous even after it's big dump this week. It's priced as a growth stock when it's clearly not growing and all efforts to grow the company have failed.

They had Vine. Vine was the same niche TikTok is today back in 2015. If they were able to make simple improvements to the app they could've had that niche in their back pocket. They mismanaged it and it failed epically. 

Anyone who has been using these apps for the pst few years can tell that it's gone down the tubes. It's a bunch of out of touch tech investing boomers who are like ""oooh tech stocks! Much growth!"" blindly buying this garbage heap.

36,AMZN," From an article I posted yesterday:  

As for SNAP's viability going forward, despite debt and lack of profit, many people may not realize there's been a major shift with respect to SNAP that kicked in about six months ago. 

Before that they were regarded as just another money-losing fad that would go away.  But to the analysts' surprise, SNAP managed to cook up viable plans to attract advertisers, and there's lots of evidence it's working.  They've had a couple of billion dollar quarters, and the inflection point of break even to profitable is coming much sooner than most imagined.  I think (?) SNAP has quietly snuck into third place among social plays.

And even the assumption that ""they're not profitable"" is superficial.  If you dig into the details of recent numbers, they could be profitable however they're putting that money into programs that attract influential content, which supercharges user growth.  And it's apparently working.  So the ""losing money"" stat is misleading, and when looked at from a different perspective, could be considered good news, not bad.  As someone who loaded up on AMZN during the final years of people saying ""but they're not profitable"" (while those people weren't noticing that profit or loss were levers controlled by Amazon) it's a familiar pattern that I find tempting.

As they've aged, it's been noted that SNAP has outlasted multiple projections of their death, by innovating.  They were considered a fad of being the disappearing messages app.  They re-invented to do filters, which continue to be inexplicably popular.  They've re-invented to do stories.  They're re-inventing now as group messaging, which is hot, and experiential, which is perfect for the now rebounding travel advertising segment.  It's becoming harder to bet on SNAP just fading away as had always been assumed.  

SNAP is also considered one of the less harmful type of social media and tech plays.  Where FB is considered pure evil, SNAP is considered benign.  Turns out that's good if you want to sell advertising.

46,TSLA," You are absolutely correct from a Car Manufacturing stand point. Tesla may have been the company to YOLO into it, and that may have been the push needed to get the other manufacturers on board. 

Where Tesla can be worth more is in their diversity into Green Energy generation and storage. While they are not the only players in the game there, they are setting the bar for consumer products in the field and it may take a decade for other companies to develop to the level of Tesla’s products and brand recognition. 

I do think that Tesla is over valued right now and that Elon Musk is someone to wary of when following for the purpose of investing. He has no shame in pumping securities and crypto to unsustainable levels and Tesla I believe is no different. I could be wrong at the end of the day, but I just have a feeling that reality will eventually hit for TSLA and I’m not going to be interested in buying in until that happens.

53,GM," I'll be honest I'm less familiar with the Chinese OEs, we have a branch that deals exclusively with them. But there are a few things to keep in kind with them:

Foreign companies working in China have to release IP to the Chinese government and have Chinese representation in their company, which can affect what is shared. Some companies like to share older tech, others will develop with Chinese OEs directly. I think this is why Ford is so small in China, and FCA is almost non-existent. GM is the only US OE really working in China and they have partnered with a Chinese company to develop tech. That being said China is a massive, massive potential market waiting for investment, dwarfing the US and the EU (as is India soon after). Any company working there with their shit sorted will explode. 

China is going full steam ahead with EV development, I'd guess because of their air quality issues but also because they recognize that EV is the future. China wants to be the leader in this, and the US is lagging woefully behind. Japan is a bit more leery and working towards hybrids, the EU seems split between both, but the US just doesn't seem to trust them, plus regulations here mean the vehicles will be more expensive, Chinese companies can develop much cheaper because they don't have to satisfy the strict rules for consumer protections or use of dangerous materials and disposing of them afterwards. 

If you bet right you will make money, but keep in kind the Chinese government can and will step in at any point. They can shut down or appropriate any company they want, at any time. These companies are a key part of Chinese diplomacy (in so much as China wants to be taken seriously abroad and wants to sell to the world like Apple or Ford or Samsung do), so it's unlikely to happen, but still there is a level of government interference in any international Chinese government that I'm personally not comfortable with for investing.

55,GM," Tesla is still in the market of luxury vehicles though. How many people on a budget do you know with an electric vehicle? I can think of two that I know personally. Yes people with $40k to spend on a sedan will get a Tesla because that's the car to have right now. For the majority of the population, they're going to get a Camry or a Malibu.

Ford, GM, VW, Nissan, Toyota all have options for EVs and will come up to meet the demand as there is actually demand. They didn't just notice they were losing out, the demand just wasn't there. People didn't and are still reluctant to pay twice as much for an EV that can't be taken on long trips and charged reliably at all in a lot of parts of the country.

Electric vehicles at the moment still only account for about 2% of the market (which those large manufacturers account for part of as well).

59,ICE," Tesla is working on (and has been very public about) a $25,000 sedan. How many of the legacy automakers have announced plans like this? Combined with the EV tax credits and the savings of charging vs. buying gas, and this puts Tesla squarely into a regular non-luxury category for many people. 

Think long term and think five years into the future. The legacy automakers are too large and have too much debt. They have to keep making ICE vehicles so they can continue paying dividends and interest from corporate bonds. They are not going dive deep into EVs until the demand for ICE fades. They are forced to move slowly into the future because their shareholders and bondholders demand profits today. 

Tesla is not shackled in this way. They hold more cash assets than debt. Their share PE is also higher than average, and that is precisely  because people are pricing in Tesla’s future potential, and not necessarily worrying about what is happening today.",rmwhereithappens,-2,/r/stocks/comments/n392a4/twitter_twtr_has_done_basically_nothing_in_its/gwosnyb/,0.062,0.842,0.096,0.7281

65,GM," > Do you really think that Ford, Chevy, Toyota won't be able to release a $25k EV when Tesla does? 

Yes, I believe that 100%. Their current EV offerings are nowhere close to Tesla in terms of price and range. And they haven't announced anything that would suggest that they are even thinking about making their EVs cheaper. They have to work on their ICE vehicles because that's where they make money and therefore what their shareholders and bondholders expect them to prioritize.

> Do you honestly believe that all of these auto giants fade away in the next 10 years and Tesla takes over?

That remains to be seen. I don't think they will merely fade away without making any noise. But their jobs are going to be super difficult over the next five years. And I also think that ICE vehicles will still exist. It will just be a much smaller market compared to EV, as far as consumer vehicles are concerned.

80,RNG," I would disagree only because as they implement better natural gas capture tech they will be able to more efficiently capture RNG and methane to sell as energy. This could open them up to becoming a hugely profitable company all over again as currently only like <10% of their current revenue comes from this. They are building more and more RNG capture facilities and have the largest of it kind in the states. Not to mention their repurposing of capped landfills into solar farms. Personally I see them as an industrial play with great exposure to the coming renewable energy boom.

83,MS," My money's on Amazon, literally. If Jassy is half as good as Bezos, their ability to succeed in any market will make them incredibly robust -- while avoiding concerns about becoming a monopoly in any one area. eCommerce is still a small fraction of overall commerce, and AWS is a profit machine.

I'm also heavy on Apple and Microsoft, but a bit less. Apple has an incredible hardware side, with innovations like the M1 chip likely to result in massive sales for years to come. But it also recognizes that it needs to transition from hardware (phones specifically) to software in order to maintain their growth rate -- their ability to diversify into a services model will be important for their long-term success. They have no cloud computing, which to me seems odd as it would be a natural extension of iCloud and an easy profit maker. I'm also a bit worried about the $90B share buyback -- while it's good for shareholders like me short-term, it implies that they have no better use for the money, like R&D. It might be evolving into a value company, not a growth company, which in tech is a dangerous thing.

Microsoft is the safest option -- it trades at a low multiple, is well diversified, and has a great CEO. Azure will keep them growing for the next several years, although it does have tough competition. The main reasons it's not my dominant position: they haven't had the same historical growth rate as Amazon or Apple, are pretty weak in the hardware department (particularly when compared to Apple), and don't have a great reputation among consumers for quality (few people really like MS Office or Windows, they just don't have other options in most circumstances).

I don't have Google or Facebook. I like Google, and I plan on adding to it if there's an opportunity. I'm a bit less enthusiastic about it, because it has less of a moat than the others and has had a recent run-up in price, so I don't think it's a bargain right now.

I'm most bearish on Facebook. They almost have an anti-moat; a ton of people younger than 40 really hate the company and its leader. Their main site will diminish in significance as demographics shift, so they need to keep acquiring the next trendy social media site to stay relevant. I view that as a dangerous game -- maybe they can pull it off, but it seems like much more of a gamble than the others. 

Warren Buffet made a good point in his recent shareholder meeting -- none of the top 20 companies by market cap from 30 years ago are still in the top 20. No one could've realistically predicted the current top 20 back then, and several of them didn't even exist then. So there's no reason to expect any of the FAAMG companies to remain dominant long-term; we need to keep watching and seeing how the landscape shifts over time.",CaterpillarWeird9087,45,/r/stocks/comments/n2we74/which_faamg_stocks_do_you_think_have_the_most/gwmfyg4/,0.083,0.72,0.197,0.9968

92,AMZN," Going in reverse order:

* GOOG: I'm skeptical on their ability to continue growing so rapidly. They're overly dependent on ads, and they dominate some of their markets (like search) so much that it's nearly impossible for them to grow it anymore without the market itself growing. The only thing Google has that I can see fueling above average growth overtime is Waymo's self driving vehicles, and a lot of evidence seems to show that Google themselves is losing confidence in Waymo (i.e. selling equity in Waymo to third parties despite having tens of billions in cash sitting around, top Waymo people leaving of late).

* FB: Too overly dependent on ads, and I don't see their non-ad revenue segments doing all that well. Like Google they also lack growth potential due to already dominating social media so much, not to mention there's *zero* chance the government is going to let them buy up another social media competitor again given all the anti-trust talk there already is around Facebook.

* AAPL: I think the Apple vs Epic lawsuit is a huge risk that could really hurt them in the next 5 to 10 years. Even if Epic loses in court, there's the legal risk of various governments cracking down on their monopoly like powers in their iOS eco-system. But at the same time I can't deny their ability to constantly defy my expectations and continue to grow. Given the mixed circumstances I put them right in the middle, with the highest probability to over or under perform based on stuff I outlined.

* AMZN: Unlike others on this list, while AMZN is huge, they aren't so big they lack any room to keep growing in their biggest markets. They're involved in a ton of different things. I think they'll continue to do well overtime.

* MSFT: The most well oiled machine of the bunch imo. They're well diversified and Azure is a beast. I think they'll continue to grow nicely overtime and outperform the other FAANGM stocks.",ShadowLiberal,3,/r/stocks/comments/n2we74/which_faamg_stocks_do_you_think_have_the_most/gwp46ze/,0.055,0.816,0.129,0.9668

121,MSFT," The case against Microsoft (10 years view)

1. On the PC world their competitors are growing faster than them (Windows --> MacApple, ChromeOS. Office --> Google Docs) 
2. On the enterprise world the same shift is happening as in the PC, just slower due to the much slower upgrade cycle.
3. Hardware would  extremely difficult for them to grow or sustain= Consoles might have reached their peak already with cloud streaming attacking on one side, and smart TVs on the other. Their rest of their hardware business hasn't gained any real momentum for years
4. Cloud is their one redemption point, especially with their revival as an open and dev friendly company (vs the closed nature of the past). However, competition is extremely competent there, so there is no reason to believe they'll gain the no.1 spot. (In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if Google overtake them).

Plus you want Jassy in the congressional antitrust hearings, you absolutely do not want Jeff there - he is terrible at it.

124,AI," I think out of all the top technology companies, Google is the winner in terms of fundamental research and development. They are at the cutting edge of many emerging industries like quantum computing and AI, and their universities collaboration is excellent. Google attracts the best and brightest out of the top graduate programs around the country - in this respect, they are far ahead of their competitors because the moon shot factories at Google really are moon shot factories. They're not just a ""practical research"" company. They are a top research company.

Whether this translates into profits, though, is a different story as we all know research is high risk, which is why traditionally universities operated at a loss and required either donations, foreign students, or government subsidies to keep them running. To the extent that Google can leverage their powerful research departments into actual profit making products and services, Google is the most promising of the big technology companies. 

But we all know what happened to IBM and Bell Laboratories - former examples of research oriented technology companies that fell on hard times when their core businesses disintegrated. To avoid the same fate, Google must do more than produce advancements. They must focus on the quality of their products & services, which until recently, I felt they were pretty mediocre at.

126,FB," On the Facebook point, I think people underestimate their moat. Let’s be honest, none of us really *like* FB as a company, which doesn’t help. That said, I love it as an investment.

While Google has a bit of a track record of failing to land innovations, it’s telling that a company as large / innovative and well-funded as Google wasn’t able to launch a successful competitor to Facebook, with Google+ collapsing. We’re not in the early noughties anymore, with multiple competing social media platforms on the same level. Which new social media platforms have the resources on hand to actually compete with Facebook? Unless they’re backed by serious money, I don’t see it.

While Facebook continues to have enormous amounts of cash on hand and successfully move into different verticals, it’ll stay ahead of any competition. Instagram remains the most popular social media platform, and its monetised very effectively. Can’t really fault Facebook’s acquisition or running of the business. Also means any new social media company is competing against both.

Slight point of pedantry with competitors: Facebook did launch before Twitter, but only just. Twitter has been around since 2006. I wouldn’t say it’s cannibalising Facebook’s market share.

Facebook is moving pretty successfully into VR gaming with the Oculus. They’re also taking a larger piece of the local marketplace pie. While at present this is against companies like Craigslist and Gumtree and therefore not too difficult, it’s establishing itself as a local marketplace. I can see it cannibalising some of eBay’s market share, particularly with partnerships like Shopify being expanded 

The biggest bear case for Facebook is that it could get broken up. As much as the Biden administration hates Facebook and big tech isn’t necessarily popular with the Democrats, it’s weathered everything so far. Even if it does get split, investors would be getting stock in some excellent individual companies.",BuffettsBrokeBro,9,/r/stocks/comments/n2we74/which_faamg_stocks_do_you_think_have_the_most/gwn1egn/,0.048,0.792,0.16,0.9887

They will have to makeup by diversifying their revenue drastically into expensive high risk areas.

160,DD," Hedge funds' underperformance is not the only piece of evidence against excessive stock picking for the average retail investors. There are plenty of literature that retail investors over the long run underperform the market as well the more they tried to pick stocks. 

Recall as well that the average retail investor command what? 500k portfolio? If you beat the market by a whopping 2X (30% as opposed to 15% of the index), you gain an extra 75k. Sounds great right? Except you have spent a lot of time and brain power on DD (and looking at price chart is not DD) to get that extra edge. If you're a professional worker like doctor or lawyer, you will easily clear more than that 75k/year. So that extra edge over the market comes at the opportunity cost, obviously unless you want to half-ass your DD and pray that you get lucky. Whereas a 1% market beat by a fund with 50 billion portfolio can afford to have legions of analyst, Phd, mathematician at their service. 

All in all, retail investors do not usually realize how much time and effort it actually take to do proper research on companies. How many people on this sub actually read carefully all the 10Ks of the companies in their portfolios? And that is only the beginning, the bare minimum, of their DD. How many retail investor will then read the 10Ks of the peers and competitors of their favored companies? How many will subscribe to and buy independent DD by professionals who do opposition research on companies?

Kevin Oleary recommends never letting one position be over 5% of your total holdings, and to never let one sector be more than 20% of your holdings. That's some good advice that I don't follow.  


A good piece of advice I DO follow is to never put more money in your brokerage account than you're prepared to lose. Seriously, as soon as it's in there, come to terms with it being gone. Much of the mistakes in the stock market are made from a lack of patience, whether its not wanting to do due diligence, or just being able to HODL for the tendies.

All I’m saying is stocks that offer good products, have good leadership, and have tangible profitability or an easily digestible business model probably won’t be subject to shorting tactics.

195,TD," So I might be somewhat qualified to answer this as I currently have accounts open at TD, Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard and M1.   Long story as to why, but a lot of it has been searching for the right account for my investing style.

What I have found is that I like each one for different reasons, but ones which are relevant to you:

If you want fractional shares, then pretty much you're limited to Fidelity or M1.   Schwab does fractional shares, but only for companies in the S&P 500 and no ETFs.   Interactive brokers is also an option but I don't have an open account over there, and they typically cater to more active traders so I can't provide much information.  I'm sure there are smaller ones out there, but I don't think I'd venture out beyond the ones I mentioned above.

Really I think the option comes down to your investment style - M1 is better for long-term investments which are 'ratio driven'.   For instance:  ""Every week, pull X dollars from my checking account, and then invest automatically to try to maintain a ratio of 60% VTI and 40% VXUS"".    You can manually trade, but the free service only has one trade window - basically all previously-entered trades (including the automatic ones) execute in a window that opens at market open each day and ends when all of the trades are done.    This is fine for long-term investing, not so great if you're trying to time the market.

Fidelity is more of a hands-on approach.  And is better if you're actually buying and selling interactive stocks.   I know some people have gotten around the transfer issue you mention by setting up a monthly schedule on say the 1st, 7th, 14th and 21st.   Doesn't make it consistent as far as which day it comes out, and there will often be a missing week at the end of the month.   Another thing to look into is whether you can push money to fidelity from your checking account (perhaps to a fidelity cash management account?) instead of pulling.",Pass_Little,4,/r/stocks/comments/n2xapg/looking_for_a_new_brokerage/gwmbwdw/,0.038,0.863,0.1,0.9692

""On May 31, 2012, the SEC approved, on a pilot basis, a National Market System Plan, known as the Limit Up/Limit Down (""LULD"") Plan, to address extraordinary market volatility.

The Plan is designed to prevent trades in NMS Stocks from occurring outside specified price bands, which are set at a percentage level above and below the average reference price of a security over the preceding five-minute period. The percentage level is determined by a security’s designation as a Tier 1 or Tier 2 security. Tier 1 comprises all securities in the S&P 500, the Russell 1000 and select Exchange Traded Products (ETPs). Tier 2 comprises all other NMS securities, except for rights and warrants, which are specifically excluded from coverage. The Plan applies during regular trading hours of 9:30 am ET - 4:00 pm ET.""

219,AMC," Short squeezes are nothing new and they certainly did not start with GME. GME ended the same way that other short squeezes have in the past. Started with a very strong, quick move to the upside. Eventually things settle and the stock collapses just as fast as it went up. If you sold on the way up, good for you. If you bought at the top, you're holding the bag.

Unfortunately many Redditors, especially those that started putting money into the market recently, caught FOMO and were left holding the bag. Now they are just angry and bitter and coming up with conspiracy theories to somehold make sense of their misfortune. It is very simple; people made a risky bet and they ended up on the losing side. Period. GME is simply trying to find an equilibrium now on its way down.

The real damage of the GME saga is not that people lost money that they could not afford to lose; it's that a bad decision taken at the beginning of someone's investing career often leads to additional bad decisions. Studies have shown that decisions and outcomes taken at the beginning of your investing career, create a bias that lasts throughout the remaining of your life. The people with a bad taste in their mouth from GME would live their lives thinking that ""the market is rigged"" or ""the hedgies are bad"" and will invest less throughout their lifetime.

It's like I told a coworker (we're both Tax CPAs with years of accounting experience). Buy a few shares for the fun of it, but don't expect much. He ended up buying $100 in AMC for $16 a share. We still get a kick out of it everyday but he still maxes the company 401k and IRA.",Reddit_Man71,9,/r/stocks/comments/n2tegg/can_trading_be_suspended_on_a_stock_violently/gwlr7wf/,0.087,0.848,0.066,-0.6698

221,GME," Yes, brokers halt trading on their end pretty frequently. I am not sure if they have been exposed as much as Robinhood was to GME though. For them to withdraw $1B from their LOC and seek additional funding sources, things must have been pretty bad.

A trading halt or suspension should not have any impact on the momentum of a short squeeze. The Limit Up/Limit Down (LULD) rule that I posted above is designed to clear all bids within a period of 15 seconds. If it doesn't do that, trading is halted by 5 minutes and resumes back. Again, these rules are made so that all transactions within a reasonable band clear the exchange but it doesn't have any impact in the movement, either up or down. A stock that is crashing because of catastrophic news or is increasing due to superb news will continue its path; regardless of how many trading halts occur.",Reddit_Man71,2,/r/stocks/comments/n2tegg/can_trading_be_suspended_on_a_stock_violently/gwlvd5o/,0.057,0.847,0.095,0.7285

228,AAPL," I’ve been feeling this exact same way. If you look at the 10Y graph for a stock like AAPL, you’ll see that the growth experienced since the pandemic started is way faster than before. It’s the same case for many other stocks.

I think this can be attributed to more people taking up the stock market as a hobby, and more people buying more shares will increase the price.

The unfortunate truth is that many of these new investors will likely sell at the first sign of a crash, so if and when we see another correction of sectors such tech, I think that’s when the true downfall will come.

I think it will likely be more of a correction than a crash, and that it may be limited to just certain sectors rather than the entire market as a whole.",maximalsimplicity,7,/r/stocks/comments/n31352/anyone_else_waiting_on_the_inevitable_market_crash/gwmvyz8/,0.069,0.805,0.126,0.762
