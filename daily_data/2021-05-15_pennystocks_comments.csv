RETC - This company has until the 18th to gain shareholder value (which is highly doubtful) or GS regains custodianship. He won it already, but forfeited it because the company said they didn't have a fighting chance and he wants to be fair about it.

MEIL - Sometime this week, probably around the say day, Sharp is going to put out a tweet about whether he did or did not win custodianship of this company as well.

If Sharp gains custodianship of either of this, it'll pump and sell off to a higher low because some people are long on his plays.",BagboyBrown,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/ncpsn4/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gy6zfdz/,0.072,0.764,0.164,0.8499

Weekly Update:

TELL investors have become much more optimistic after Charif Souki’s fireside chat at a conference hosted by Citi bank. 

Souki literally said that he has “no doubt” about finalizing commercial agreements and expects them to be finalized and announced over “the next few weeks”

Souki also said that he anticipates 12-15M tones of capacity to be sold completely through zoom indicating that there is heavy demand for the product offering. 

Good article about the interview https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/natural-gas/051221-tellurian-to-finish-commercialization-of-driftwood-lng-first-phase-in-few-weeks-souki

Here is the actual video https://youtu.be/bhmSef_1eUM

Tellurian CEO was appointed chairman of the US/Korea business council. “The USKBC is comprised of leading U.S. companies operating in Korea and is the primary U.S.-based business organization promoting strong economic ties between the two countries.” Maybe a deal with korea is on the horizon? https://www.uschamber.com/press-release/oct-vio-sim-es-appointed-chairman-of-the-us-chamber-s-us-korea-business-council

When i finally did my dd i thought 1 bil market cap was way overvalued.
Hope this thing will rocket for you someday so you can get rid of the bags.

Ask yourself how long it will take. Maybe you can make up that 5k loss quicker elsewhere.

Do your DD ctxr for example. Might help you on your way on getting some of it back.",Eslhunt,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/nd67nt/zom_bag_holder/gy979kt/,0.027,0.883,0.089,0.6369
46,ALL," I looked into that, but see some serious negatives...

1. HLOGF  is WAY riskier since it has not even started drilling.  DMEHF has already de-risked the project.
2. Its share structure is much better near 10x less (60 some million vs. 600+ million OS).
3. The fact DMEHF is in U.S. soil and has SO many end users makes signing contracts easy AND with a decreased capex since they don't even have to ship it to the buyers.
4. One big issue very specific for Helium which folks don't understand is shipping helium in ANY container loses up to 18% of the volume by escape into the environment when it is simply transported 1 DAY in ANY closed container if it is hot outside.  Being in Tanzania means A LOT of that helium will be lost in transport to the port, transported across an ocean, and then transported by truck to the end buyer.  My guess is  loss will be 20-40% EASY, if not more.  That means the demand at HLOGF will have to sell at a discount to its competitors to account for the loss of helium in transit.
5. Not sure I trust HLOGF being honest about timelines.  Both companies state q4 for selling, but by the time HLOGF even starts (June) DMEHF will have been done with 4 wells with another 2 on the way and they even admit they may be pushed back to q1.

Also,, while doing some DD on Helium One it was interesting as I found an article about them making this great find as they state now in 2018!  That exact article was just republished again this year.  Why has nothing happened in 2018?  Just was odd.  Didn't investigate enough to see if there was an actual reason so maybe folks more knowledgeable will chime in?

Helium One is a good play as well but you are wrong about being cheaper.  DMEHF has a MC of 182MILLION and HOGF of 164 MILLION.  So basically same market cap with ALL the above negatives.  The biggest being it is full risk on vs. DMEHF which has vastly derisked.  Big difference.",10xwannabe,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/ncykmd/dmefh_helium_play_summary/gy82gq0/,0.084,0.798,0.118,0.9546

51,UK," It took years to get the permits.  They have done seismic testing but only got the go ahead a month ago.  Yes they are riskier, but the helium should be easier to mine and in concentrations much, much higher.  You are correct about the market cap.  Valid point which I had forgotten.  

I think since HE1 is a British company, travel times will be less.  Most of the market will be UK and EU.  So honestly I don’t see a reason to invest in both of you believe as strongly as I do about the value of Helium.  I only had the funds for one at the moment and chose HGOLF.  I do plan on investing in both when I have the available capital.
