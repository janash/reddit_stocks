85,TA," Yes, but not for the reason that you think. Every year things change in a company. They can go through new structuring, develop new drugs, create new partnerships, gain profitability, lose profitability, etc. When analysts predict estimates they do so based on fundamentals, nothing to do with technicals. I am almost certain that these analysts make predictions once the 10-K’s (annual reports of companies) come out and make subtle adjustments when 10-Q’s come out (quarterly reports). They can get a detailed view of the performance of the companies and determine a likely price target from that information. A smart analyst would wait until they get their hands on the 10K to determine the likely outcome of the company within a year. People rely on these reports to determine where their money should move to. That being said, estimates can change quite significantly if performance is down or up from the previous fiscal year.

The green line is the avg. estimate level. The red line is the ending of the time that analysts believe the company should reach a said performance (EOY). From these two lines, a point is created from the intersection. I matched the point with another point, within the same fiscal year, that the company was at its most undervalued. From the points, the slope(cyan) that is created determines a trend that the stock will follow if predictions are correct. You can think of the dotted grey line as a different level than others believe its value will be at. In the same case as before, I connected the lowest point with the point that is formed by the EOY line creating a different slope(grey).  These slopes will be different ofc because of the differentiation of what analysts believe is its value.

I think it’s important to note that in many predictions, analysts tend to follow the pack and because of this, the average may not truly be a correctly predicted value. In this case, it’s important to dig into why the analysts that deviate from the pack do so and determine if it’s justified or not based on your own beliefs. I’ll post a link to the other slope of the high prediction in case anyone wanted to take a look at that but it's at 35$.

For the purple line. In every bullish or bearish market, there will be a support level and a resistance level. Typically, but not always, when support is lost, a bearish market occurs where resistance takes over and creates a descending channel and when the support takes over an ascending channel takes over. The support and resistance lines create slopes. That can be mapped which is what the purple line represents.

In all the lines, but one, my graph relies on fundamentals gathered from analysts and is plotted with an initial of its most undervalued point in the year. To answer your question, TA looks like voodoo to the ones who aren't TA's and performs like voodoo to the ones who don't know know how to correctly use it.

221,ALL," This was a bit of my theory

I was looking at my alerts ""many tickers I don't own"" I set at the same time.
And kept seeing the normal drop of about 10.xxx%

This was last week and this week
Also noticed how they would conveniently rise up around the same percentage.

Then this week, most of those stocks that dropped greatly last week....I was getting alerts for increase on about 25-30%

Then, I began comparing the charts.

And there's NO DAMN WAY that many tickers ""40+"" would ALL have almost the exact same charting.

So, I think it's gonna happen next week also..keep an eye out for it

And when the stimulus goes through..they will know ahead of time, and pump it up enough to manipulate the masses of sheep.

251,DNN," Exactly correct. There are only 2 downsides.

1. If DNN rockets past 2.50 you lose on potential profits but still made $160 profit. 

2. DNN only drops and the calls you write aren’t bought. 

If you plan on holding DNN for a long time then covered calls are the way to go. There is very little risk associated with losses. Even if your call is assigned and you lose the 100 shares, you can write a cash secured put and recoup the shares.

This lowers my effective cost per share to $0.91 each.  As long as SNDL stays above $1 on the expiration date later this month, I make the maximum of $0.09 per share.

256,IMO," IMO, the stimulus (which should get passed by the Senate sometime next week) could make for a few green days or even the week. But it could also be priced in as we had a pretty big green Day earlier this week already. Debating getting back into some positions that were triggered by stop losses tomorrow just to recoup some losses but timing the market is a fools game. We'll see what I do. 

Aside from the next week, it's my belief that we'll be in a red market for at least the rest of March and probably April. When everyone gets their first rounds of vaccinations (end of May is expected date every US citizen who wants one will get one) and things start to consistently open up and stay open we will be back in the green. May-September is going to be a hard bull run, the remainder of 2021 will be but the next couple months are either going to be red or sideways.

260,ZOM," This is really hard to say as the market is now adjusting to the realities of higher bond yields, higher inflation, and preparing for interest rates rising within the next two years. The institutions have been rotating their money out of tech and growth stocks and moving them back into banking, travel, and value stocks in general. Stocks like ZOM which are already incredibly overvalued (like 80% of the stock market in general) with no revenue are starting to see a massive drop in valuation to fall in line with earnings and people are starting to dump their positions as the market has been plummeting. 

Unlike what we saw in March where there was a massive crash followed by a boon in trading with a lot of first-time traders getting their feet wet and making big money, I think a lot of people who kept rolling their money into the market and are now seeing huge losses will stay out for a bit. The reopening of the economy has already been priced in, and after the stimulus happens, I feel like we’re going to be in some rough times as an era of easy money starts drawing to a close. If we see inflation hitting over 3 or 3.5%, expect the Fed to be raising interest rates sooner than expected which will be painful for everyone. I hope I’m wrong for everyone’s sake.

The reason CHEK went down isn’t because it got bad news or bad fundamentals, its because its following the current irrational market fear frenzy. Its dumb to isolate CHEK and explain why its down individually when its fundamentals haven’t changed and it received no news. CHEK is down because of the market, not because of CHEK. And yes most stocks are trading the same way right now.

EDIT: what wsb logo? What are you talking about?

EDIT 2: CHEK might have had a high short interest before the crash, but both heavily shorted stocks and non heavily shorted stocks are falling at the same rates. And speculative growth stocks are the ones taking the biggest hit. Even if CHEK wasn’t shorted at all, it would’ve fallen all the same.",Leading-Version-7671,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lyffar/if_anyone_wants_to_really_know_whats_going_on/gpsflyt/,0.144,0.788,0.068,-0.8823

302,ALL," AH reading is allowed but most stop at 8 pm and start at 4 am. But this is almost never available to retail investors for most securities. 

The main reason for this is lack of buyers and sellers at hours where people generally sleep. People people have failed misconception that the price of a stock is the average price that was sold and bought- but this is incorrect. The price of a stock is just the last bid ask transaction. Meaning it is entirely possible for someone to buy 100,000 stocks at 2:00 am where the volume is low so all limit sell orders are executed and then for him to make a single order of 1,000$ and have someone make a sell of 1,000$ at 2:01 am and now ALL of the shares of that stock are worth 1,000$. 

This is an exaggerated example but it is possible without larger volume. Retail investors rarely  have enough buying power to make these moves so markets use “market makers” (ig. Big banks) that sell and buy stocks at fraction of a second all day long to drive up the available of the stocks and to keep prices stable.",JoeWelburg,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lxwd0q/why_cant_i_trade_during_after_market_hours/gpqkbfq/,0.072,0.874,0.054,-0.5719
