14,GME," Just asking: aren't these Hedgies skilled enough to keep playing this out: sharp rise but not too high, let it coast back down and settle for a few weeks, repeat, etc.. and shift their shorts to the higher spectrum all the while? It would be helpful to see a list of all the short positions prior to the last big run-up v. the current, and some kind of accounting of who they're beholden to provide the shares sold short to. It looks like hedgies will accept low earth orbit but stop short of moon landing prices and no one is particularly chasing them down to enforce short covering and they're basically colluding to avoid the infinite squeeze. 

If this is going to rinse, wash repeat every few weeks instead of one explosive climb then it could be lucrative in a repetitious way.

IBorrowDesk reported over a  million shares were shorted between 1:45pm and 2pm EST. They were  trying to prevent GME from hitting 50, which is where peak delta hedging  would have happened. Needless to say, this didn't work.

Looking  at the rest of the options chain, there doesn't seem to be any more big  blocks of calls. The problem is that with what happened in January, GME  has strike prices all the way to 800.

69,GME," I’m a dipshit (so keep that in mind about what I say below) that turned $3K into $80K then got out at 40K once things started crashing.  I said I was done with GME, but I’m def going to buy a few deep OTM calls tomorrow at open, and then a few OTM puts with a late March or April expiration. Unless of course it tanks pre-market. So the FOMO is real.

I think we’ll have a better idea of where things are headed  before open. If it gaps down hard then it will probably stay down. I’d think that means that whatever needed to be covered was covered since the MMs and HFs probably wouldn’t wait until open to keep covering knowing that the WSB army is about to send volume through the roof. Also, if it is down big time then a lot of people are going to think twice about jumping in.

If it’s flat or up then I think it will be huge because that means the is enough institutional demand to support those prices. 

Also, nothing I just said is supported by facts (other than the part about me being a dipshit), and is all conjecture.",Mps242,10,/r/stocks/comments/lrrcdk/gme_gamma_squeeze_part_two/gontffp/,0.027,0.906,0.067,0.872

That being said, it fired me up inside and I’ve been reading, watching videos, asking questions, and overall obsessed with trading. I did well with paper stocks and then did it with money and was met with a cold rude awakening that it’s not the same lol. But I’m doing ok. I bitch about being 20% down, but I have a small account ($300), I have identified the mistakes I’ve made to cause it, have improved my risk management and just waiting for swings back up. We still have 2 GME shares sitting at $140. I should have averaged down, but I listened to people who said that doesn’t work and wish I had. Hindsight.

88,DD," u/hooman_or_whatever first off godspeed with your recovery.

Another thought for you to consider for Pt5: the implications of CFO Jim Bell being forced out. Not from the perspective of the company, but rather the shorts. 

I've seen some compelling DD connecting him to Citadel and Ken Griffin as early as the 1990s, including tenures across two other companies that were driven to bankruptcy or close to it under his time as CFO. If it happens once it's Random. If it happens twice, coincidence. If it happens a third or fourth, you begin to wonder. 

And the seed was planted in my head even before finding out about the former CFOs history when Jim Cramer tweeted out critical of the move to let him go. It seemed so odd a thing to pick on - he'd been on Cathy and Cohens case all day - especially considering the CFO didn't do much to reverse GameStops fortunes. 

And then the links. For all intents and purposes, Jim Bell has served Undertaker for these companies. Perhaps he was the unlocked door to let in the excessive shorts. It certainly paid out well for him. And if that's the case, his expulsion is end of the line for some of the implicated shorts. Their last security to guarantee bankruptcy of GME gone...time to cover. But perhaps also time to close the positions before more is made of these possible sinister links.

I don’t see anything wrong with that plan so long as it’s coming from your “fuck it“ fund. I wouldn’t advise such a risky play if it’s money you are reliant on or could be spent better elsewhere. I’m a high-risk investor but this is closer to gambling, I would like to deem it “educated gambling“. So I personally feel I would regret it more not taking some sort of shot.

Coincidently, I was watching the TV show “Billions” a few days ago, and there was a scene in which in order to get out from a short play gone wrong, the CEO of the HF negotiates a deal with another HF (a large shareholder) to buy up all their shares for 150% of market price. One of the show’s advisors is Andrew Sorkin, a former Wallstreet guy who is a host on CNBC I think, so the show’s financial plots are supposed to be somewhat realistic, which makes me think this is a common occurrence.

191,GME," Gamestop became a meme stock, but honestly the play was rational. There is a large amount of short interest, and there were FUD campaigns to crash GME to the ground. Among others, but most notably, Wall Street Bets found a way to exploit this. Buy GME, hold, and let the shorts bleed by having to pay interest. To stop the bleeding they'll slowly be willing to pay more and more to buy shares to cover their positions. This artificial reduction in supply, not letting GME crash by refusing to sell/sell low, and shorts paying interest on their positions sets up the potential for a short squeeze. There is no ""next stock"" that WSB, Reddit and/or social media is going to attack. It was never an attack. It was catching shorts with their pants down. The GME short squeeze fiasco was not a coordinated attack or coordinated manipulation attempt. Anyone pushing ""the next stock"" is just trying to make a quick buck. That's not to say that other opportunities or other lucrative opportunities don't exist, and some of them may be meme stocks, but it's not just ""okay, which stock do we flock to next. Just because a stock is being shorted doesn't mean it's a short squeeze opportunity either. Understand the reasoning why a meme stock is a meme stock, but don't buy it just because ""one meme stock went up, so the others will too."" Again. There's no ""next stock.""

221,GME," Someone big finally caved and covered naked shorts seeing how prices weren't going down and it's too expensive or impossible to postpone further? After all people at WSB are holding or even buying more GME for the sake of it, and there was a limited number of stocks available at near market price for big short holders, catapulting the prices up as soon as that pool got purchased.

Question is whether this triggers a chain reaction now or other shorts try to wait it out hoping some holders panic sell again or jump on early profits. The irrational behavior regarding GME is fascinating as many people are just.. holding the stock and not selling regardless of its price, which naturally makes the prices skyrocket like this (or more, there isn't really a ceiling as long as more stocks are held than there is demand for from those who have to or want to buy).",PastaPandaSimon,1,/r/stocks/comments/lroqne/why_are_the_meme_stocks_surging_up_again/gonn1fg/,0.067,0.847,0.087,0.5106

227,AMC," What do you mean? People are not buying the company, never were, they are buying into the opportunity of being on the winning side of a short squeeze. Shares were and still are massively over shorted and they (short sellers) have manipulated the market in ways that most people still have yet to fully uncover in attempt to dodge, delay, and cheat their way out of it. The ones holding their shares even after it dropped from $300-$400 back down to below $100 and then to $50 knew it was all a bunch of fucking bullshit and now the time is coming to force the shorts to cover once and for all. GME became a meme because it was a ticking time bomb waiting to go off. The thing is, right as the fuse started to get ridiculously close to blowing it all up, they threw a bunch of shit over it in an attempt to defuse it and create distractions to cover it up. Well, there’s still some TNT left in that bitch, ready to go. And apes are holding onto their shares hoping it will finally be set off. A short squeeze of the magnitude that $GME was/is in is a once in a lifetime opportunity. If you don’t think people aren’t willing to buy into that concept and wait to make the squeeze happen (or not🤷‍♂️) then you’re crazy. Investing is about making returns. And the possibility of +xxx% or +x,xxx% returns are enough to justify lots of purchase volume (which drives the price up in itself). Conan O’Brien even bought shares of GME. Not because he is a fan of buying used PS3 games at GameStop, lol, but because he believes in the weight of the situation at hand and is willing to put money at risk to be a part of it just like everybody else that is holding GME right now myself included. An investment is an allocation of money in the expectation of some return in the future. In this case, you’re not investing in GameStop per say, but rather the situation of another possible short squeeze, or at least a continuation of the squeeze that occurred in late January. 
As far as the other meme stocks, idk why people are still buying into BB and NOK and what not, but I definitely understand the AMC hype given that it’s a ‘pandemic stock’ that is bound to rebound after reopening and being fully operational again. If you’re investing in AMC for short term gains you’re not smart, theaters aren’t even open where I live so it should be a long term play. It’s just that GME is a stand alone opportunity with the amount of shares that were shorted at one point (~170% of the entire float) and I don’t get why everyone is constantly grouping GME in with all these other shitty dying stocks. GME is different, it’s about draining the greedy short sellers of their >100% bets that got caught red handed in the cookie jar. BB and NOK I feel were people catching on to the trend of how the masses could affect the stock price of $GME so people that missed out tried to create a pump and dump scenario with those. I even gave in and bought some shares of those stocks as well but of course regret it, as it is nothing more than a distraction away from GME.

But I mean it for both bulls and bears. People who had the means but were too scared to buy the dip at 40, when the stock was hitting 40 when WSB had still 2M members, also made a mistake.

There is an ""all or nothing"" mentality much in sintony with Ark's crazy religious statements going on.

\- that the hedge funds and the media and the social networks are all working against GME holders, or

\- it was just mass hysteria and the whole thing was a mistake and hedge funds are good and didn't cause the 2008 market crash

I think there is a lot to digest. There IS some extent of media manipulation (rather unintentional just because they speak hedge fund language, where inequality is justified and hedge funds are rich because they deserve it and retail traders are poor because they're just dumb).

There is also a purpose to holding, to this new type of financial activism. A lot of wealth distribution is going on.

285,GME," 100% agreed. Banks understand GME is the financial equivalent of a gigaton nuclear bomb and the timer is ticking down. Banks want no part of this. Market makers are  arbiters to this transaction right now, and are better prepared to handle it, that's why you didn't see crazy trading halts on the way up, their algorithms are much more aggressive this time to make sure liquidity stays intact and the bid-ask spread isn't thousands of dollars wide again. They don't make money that way, they make money through price discovery, which we saw that loud and clear today. As long as they can handle it, you won't see sudden discontinuities like we did last time.

&#x200B;

The catalyst was Fedwire et al going down. There were no lifelines to the banks if the market makers and clearinghouses couldn't handle the price action, so margin calls and hedging **had** to take place so they didn't lose their ass, because the bank was not going to be there today to bail them out. Very simple market dynamics, fren.

&#x200B;

Also, a shitton of $76 2/26 calls got executed today, all of them in float, there was only one available when I saw they were trading for .03 earlier. THREE FUCKING CENTS! Everything around it was over $20. Looks like someone with overnight access was able to buy up a few and issue some new sell orders. Suddenly 4x .93 were available.

&#x200B;

Look, I get the trepidation, but this isn't about fundamentals. It's just not, so if you are a fundy trader just step aside. You need to see the big picture in play here to appreciate what's going on. Retail has big money by the balls because of hubris, plane and simple. Until big money pays us and steps out of the way the bomb will continue to tick down and the price is going to continue to climb.

The CFO resigned, and when that news broke GME reacted positively, but no more than gaining a few dollars a share. And you're right -- CFOs resign all the time, it never results in that kind of a surge.

I have this theory that maybe they know who is being targeted for the replacement CFO, and it just hasn't been formally announced. And whoever it is falls in line with Ryan Cohen's vision for where he wants to take GME, and perhaps sheds a bit more light on his ambitious plan for the company.

343,GME," I made a bunch of money on the last GME run up, but I'm on the sidelines for this one.  It makes me think about the future though.

Should the takeaway here be that GME is a powder keg, with the short interest, calls and meme status? Like -- when the stock settles back into the 40s, it seems like it'll be a good time to buy more and get ready for the next match to drop. The formula for this one seems similar to last time...

Catalyst bumps up price, which triggers a gamma squeeze by pushing the price up over a lot of call volume.  

I suspect we'll see similar again. GME will crash back down to earth after this squeeze. Shorts will jump back in. People will buy calls to hedge and the bomb will sit until the next catalyst. If Cohen is forcing out executives, odds are the CFO won't be the last. Plus there will be earnings  in march.

Overall -- my takeaway is -- don't jump in at a stupid price point. Be patient, wait for the price to come back down to earth and then wait for the next wave to come in.",IamTheShrikeAMA,31,/r/stocks/comments/ls2ow1/gme_megathread_for_thursday_february_25th_2021/gop867x/,0.062,0.831,0.107,0.8978

354,GME," Been debating buying in since last night and haven't pulled the trigger. There was a pretty strong selloff at $200 AH yesterday, so I'd imagine there's going to be a similar wall today in the $190-200 range, if it gets that far. If GME gets past that, I think you see it immediately run to $300. Don't see this second spike ever breaking $300, as much as I'd like it to. 

The other version is that a lot of bag-holders see this spike and you have an aggressive selloff at market open. For as much as people say they're HODLing/diamond hands, give people a chance to recoup a decent portion of their losses and people will sell faster than they'll admit. 

Since this is a meme stock, your key levels are the even numbers - $100 and $200. As long as GME holds $100 through any morning dumping it'll probably see $200 today. Ideally looking to buy in around $100-110 if I can get it, but I'd probably end up being a buyer at $125.

355,AMC," Today is going to be a very weird but nonetheless interesting day for the markets. I don't think it's going to play out 100% like January 27th/28th. Something different already is that if you look at the charts, GME starting taking off near the last 30 minutes and especially soared during after hours. What I suspect from this is that institutional investors such as Blackrock are going back in to the battlefront. Let's be real here, retail investors simply don't have as much volume as they think. My analogy for those who watch Attack on Titan is think of titans battling one another on GME with the human retail investors at the sidelines doing support and reconnaissance. Of course, we love a good story and there is definitely a David and Goliath narrative being pushed of retail investors taking down the hedge funds and Robinhood to spur momentum. Though having institutional investors on the long position is not a bad thing, in fact I'd argue that the one reason we have not seen Congress or the SEC take decisive action on this is because they know GME is a nuke that is ready to go off and it's better to just look at the aftermath.

Which leaves a question, why would institutions short again after the shitshow last time, you'd think we taught those old folks a lesson? Well, GME was at $350 during the peak and held support at $90-100 for a while before dipping to $40-50. From a numbers and fundamentals perspective, it actually would be the correct move to short GME at $50-300 because in an ideal world (the efficient-market hypothesis, disclaimer: not an economics student lol), GME does not have the fundamentals to support a price of $50+. However, the funny thing about the stock market is that it's not simply fundamentals; emotions, hype, and feedback loops throw the market into chaos. What this means is that while hedge funds did make the correct move in shorting, particularly as a means to cover their previous positions, this plan could fall apart with enough sentiments.

My take is that we are seeing institutional and high frequency traders cannibalizing each other and GME became the battlefront of this showdown. However, I do find it funny that a lot of the other stocks like BB, AMC, NOK, etc. that were a part of the hype back in January are also caught in this storm with their tickers showing a similar pattern. I'm guessing there were algorithms and crawlers that managed to catch up while other investors prepare for what is another frenzy in the stock market. Odds are high that we're going to see another red day in the market as the volatility creates more fear and institutional investors cut their losses by selling off their more lucrative long positions. To a lesser extent, there might be FOMO and retail investors, at least a few on WSB are selling off parts of their portfolio to jump on the train again. I do want to know what becomes of this.... what's going to happen with DFV, how will brokers and the SEC react, and what is the conclusion to this Gamestop saga.

I painfully watched the hearing and can almost give Vlad the benefit of the doubt about that regulatory requirements for the extra margin, but he said they’ve now got more money to back Robinhood in case it happens again... so I say... show me the money or Fool Me Twice!!!

399,SI," Just posting this to get my thoughts on paper and hear any feedback.

On 2/10 I bought a 3/5 $175c for $2.55. That was the day of the SI report so I figured I would just throw a dart and see if it hit. I watched it dwindle down to $.50 and wrote it off in my head as a loss.

Then Wednesday happened and it rocketed up. I didn’t want to sell but I also wanted to ensure I made profits, so I rolled my call up to a 2/26 $140c for a $1,200 credit (net profit $945). I figured that gave me locked in profits and I still had a call.

But then I thought that it would be even safer to roll my call BACK a week at a higher strike price so I wouldn’t have the time decay destroy me. So I rolled that call to a 3/5 $250c for $50 (net profit now $895).

Which of those three would you have done? Or another strategy? I’m interested to hear if this makes sense. This is my first time rolling options and I’m not sure if my logic makes sense. I plugged them all into Option Strat to track them over the next week to see what ultimately would have been the best.",SURGE_ACME_OFF,3,/r/stocks/comments/ls2ow1/gme_megathread_for_thursday_february_25th_2021/goq9aoh/,0.062,0.779,0.16,0.9767

Fridays mean weekly gambles have to closed out, so there's some closure to the week and big chances for stocks to continue up. That will most likely happen if the stock price ends high today.

If I were you and this was 10 fun money I wanted to play with, I would sell tomorrow at a high point you think looks nice and take maybe $100 in profit. I would then wait for GME to sink again in a week or so, which is likely after this squeeze, and put that money back into GME stock.

Like piling into TSLA, a 1,000+ PE stock based off the assumption it will dominate markets that do not currently exist, won't face significant competition when the markets do exist, can find large margins in historically tight margin industries, will paradoxically grow faster as the business becomes larger and will survive and thrive through the upcoming correction (whenever it happens).

It seems if your investment strategy justifies that being your largest holding then almost any purchase of any company with lofty dreams can be justified.

And you know this.....how? You don’t know the industry. Is it because Ark Invest told you it will grow greatly in the future?

Edit: One of my favorite quotes ever. 

> “People hear a tip on a bus on some stock, they’ll put half their life savings in it before sunset. And they wonder why they lose money in the stock market. And when they lose money, they blame it on the institutions and program trading.
That is garbage. They didn’t do any research. They got a piece of junk. They never looked at a balance sheet and that’s what you get for it. And that’s what we’re being driven to. It’s self-fulfilling. The public does terrible investing and they say they don’t have a chance. It’s because that’s the way they’re acting. I’m trying to convince people there is a method. There are reasons for stocks that go up.” 

Instead of the bus. Now it’s reddit. “Dude GME is going to $1000!” Or “ARKG is the way to go. Gene editing technology is the future!” Ect ect.

I don’t mean to sound mean but I’m really trying to get through to you. Have you read any academic research on the medical ethics of gene editing? Do you know what the researchers and experts are saying about the field? You know tech like CRSPR will only be available for the rich upper class, how do you think societal pressures Inflamed by wealth inequality will react to such a technology only being available for the wealthy elites? Have you looked into any of the recent testing they’ve done? Have you looked at any academic peer reviewed research on genomic technology? Or are you buying ARKG off a whim?

You said, you've only been involved in the market for 8 months, market performance over that timeline is not 'normal'. The gains have been way above normal due to three factors.

No one really does tbh. If you're in it for the long haul (which it sounds like you are), then just turn everything off and forget it exists for the next week or two. All your holdings are pretty solid, so just stay patient. 

Alternatively, change the time frame on your charts. The last two weeks have SUCKED for me, but when I zoom out to where I started back, in August, these last two weeks are just a blip, I've more than doubled my money since and will continue to make more eventually - maybe not yesterday or today, or even next week, but I believe in what I have (I like the stocks) and I know it'll keep climbing. 

As many others have said here, if you have the spare cash to do it, times like these are like going sales shopping for your favorite stocks.

I have a feeling that many people buying right now will get hit hard with some of these stocks. I have nothing good or bad to say about NERD, but what exactly have they done since March of last year to triple their stock.

Well, for one, his public sentiment on Value Investing begins [here](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/sites/valueinvesting/files/files/Buffett1984.pdf).  But his education began [here](https://i.imgur.com/thvwQRw.jpg).

Graham was big on the concept of ""margin of safety""... implicit in his thesis statement (which should be committed to memory):

>An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return.  Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.

As Buffett notes in his preface to *The Intelligent Investor*, Graham did not consider speculation investing... and that's where I feel fairly confident I understand what Graham means by ""value"" because he was not looking at companies priced 44 or 30 or 20 or 10 times book, but 1.5 times book at most.

He went a step further, advocating that an investor grant himself a ""margin of safety"" below intrinsic value.  That is, if a company's intrinsic value of x, you would be wise to pay, let's say, 0.75x to give yourself a cushion in the event that your valuation is bloated.

To paraphrase Buffett, I'll never understand why some people want to pay a dollar for sixty cents rather than the other way around.  All else being equal, if we bought the same stock and I paid closer to fair value for it, my payday will always be bigger than yours.  And if your only answer is ""tech hasn't been at..."" then you're blinkered and awed by the bullshit of VC's and street analysts who have a vested interest in inflated valuations.

Roger Lowenstein prefaces Part 1 of *Security Analysis*:

>Coca-Cola's earnings were rising sharply in the early and mid-1990s, and the company's aggressively promotional CEO, Roberto Goizueta, was feted on the cover of *Fortune.* Goizueta was talented, but his talent was fully reflected in Coca-Cola's earnings, and the earnings were reflected in the price of the stock. Investors, however, went a further step, pushing the stock to a lofty 45 times earnings due to their faith in management to increase earnings. Graham and Dodd referred to this as ""double-counting""—that is, investors buy the stock on the basis of their faith in management and then, seeing that the stock has risen, take it as additional proof of management's powers and bid the stock up further.  In 1997, an analyst at Oppenheimer was so smitten by Goizueta, who died later that year, that he wrote Coca-Cola had ""absolute control over near term results.""

If Graham's central argument is that you shouldn't be the fool who overpays, but the shrewd investor who sells to the fool who overpays, who am I to argue?",th3cr1t1c,3,/r/stocks/comments/lrol0x/nvidia_earnings_results/gonpml5/,0.047,0.808,0.146,0.9912

2. They don't have large, esoteric Level 3 asset balances, unlike banks.
3. Given 1 & 2, you can have greater confidence in tangible book, fair value, net current assets, etc. to triangulate intrinsic value the way M&A guys do.

595,CEO," There's been news about GME, not sure how you could have missed it.  It's actually rather late.  The hedges can't buy shares because it's not being sold by retailers nor offered from the company and the interest owed on needing to fill those short orders is catching up.  The brokerages that halted the buying of those a couple weeks ago only stalled the squeeze as the debts came due.  The longer it takes those shorts to cover those positions the more the interest drives the price up, and there is an awful lot of interest, as we can see with the FUD and obscurity of real data, IE who's in and how much for.  Supply and demand + covering for all outstanding short contracts + interest and bound by the bottomless bet of shorting laws.  I'm not a professional, so this is just my interpretation of what the meme stocks say vs the networks and hedges.

TL;DR:  Go watch the hearing with Keith Gill(DFV), Reddit CEO, Melvin CEO, Citadel CEO, and Robinhood CEO.  The only guy there not even shook is the guy the networks tried to paint as a joke, he didn't even have a lawyer with him.  He backed the testimony up by getting in deeper the next day.

The people over on r/GME have been doing (admittedly, somewhat speculative) but thorough and compelling research that explains what we’re seeing today.

When the next best explanation for what we’re seeing is “there is no explanation”, perhaps it’s time to start hearing out the explanations provided by the people that have literally been predicting these movements for weeks. r/GME

608,DDD," Nothing has changed in 90 years.   Nothing.   Some small stocks go up quickly and go back down even faster.  When the bull is running everyone looks like a genius and thinks they can continue to double their money in a few months.   Then the bears have their turn,  the overall market may fall 20%, but those high flying triple baggers go down like 80% and all you paper gains are gone along with half your initial investment.   Slow and steady, big dividend stocks that over time keep going up slowly are the way you make money.   

Example,  I bought QCOM in March and may 2015 at $68.  It had a good story,  solid money,  good dividend,  5G in the future,  plus trouble with Apple.  I  bought more as it went down,  some at $60 and more in 2019 at $55.  They paid me $2.40 a share every year to wait.   When it jumped i sold 2/3 of it. It's still a decent stock but the dividend yield is low now.   I slept easy at night.

If you buy things that move fast you have to get lucky three times ( right stock, right entry,  right exit).  Some people win the lottery,  most just give the government their money every week.   I don't play.   

My next door neighbor bought DDD in June 2014 at $50, by January he was bragging that he had doubled his money and that I should have listened to him. By April he was back to even money and by June he gave up and sold at $30 losing almost half his initial money. 

Over time, bull through bear, expect to make about 7% to 10% a year average.

663,DK," From my point of view, two important factors lead to after hours trading.

First, is Market Makers. One of the most stressful parts of being a market maker is the dreaded ""DK"". DK means ""don't know"" and it happens when a market maker has submitted a trade ticket and the person they traded with doesn't submit a matching trade ticket (if you ever wondered why people who trade on the NYSE have badges with random text like ""GS69"" it's because that is their trader ID and it used to match trades).

Market Makers generally make all their money doing arbitrage and so they strive to be market neutral, so having a DK means the MM may have to suddenly buy or sell at whatever the current price is. Getting the other side to clear a DK is best, but beyond that being able to close a trade before the uncertainty of of the market open is very desirable.

Next is the rise of ECN, or electronic clearing networks that rose in the late 1980's and early 1990s (Archipelago was the first huge ECN I believe). Because these networks didn't rely on the physical aspects of the trading floors at the NYSE, NASDAQ and AMEX, they proposed to be able to make markets before and after the traditional market hours.

In my opinion, it was these two powerful forces that caused after hours trading to be approved.

It should be noted that in the majority of cases the bid/ask prices are very close to the closing price, so imo the system works very well.",nanmart,2,/r/stocks/comments/lrz748/why_is_afterhours_trading_even_a_thing/goq4o0c/,0.028,0.883,0.089,0.9396

This is a general misconception about stocks. If something has a perfectly sound business model and is making tons of money, it still isn't neccessarily a good investment. 

It's a good investment when the stock price is in line with the business. If it's vastly overpriced it really doesn't matter how successful the company is.

E.g. Microsoft in 2000. It was the major player is software and IT which was the biggest future market at the time. Yet, if you bought  at the peak in 2000 you would need to wait 15 years to just break even on your investment.

704,SCR," I'll present an abbreviated bear case, based on the financials.

1) The actual non-betting operations of SCR are not particularly worth much. That should be evident based on its historical stock price.

2) theScore seems to be sending signals that they think the stock is overpriced.

In August 2020, theScore issued 39.5M shares (3.95M now) for C$25.6.

Up until December 2020, theScore was issuing shares at C$1.40 ($14 now).

They are once again issuing new shares, at an even higher price.

3) In the most recent quarter, C$55.8M was wagered, with negative revenues earned by theScore. This is substantial growth from 2019; however, theScore has not been able to turn that into true earnings yet. It also relies on additional substantial growth in order to justify the current market cap. Even with substantial growth, theScore will still need to find a way to turn that into profit.

I'm not saying this is a disaster in the making - but it is far from a sure thing, and the worst case scenario could be pretty rough.",uncreativePFC,0,/r/stocks/comments/lrqsv3/scr_everything_you_need_to_know_about_this/gopwgqk/,0.063,0.804,0.133,0.7586

IN Q1 2021 they achieved an all-time record quarter for media revenue, generating $10.6 million, primarily driven by strong growth in direct advertising sales in both the U.S. and Canada.

Total views of theScore esports’ video content across all platforms reached a new all-time quarterly record of 357 million, year-over-year growth of 355%. It's historical stock price shows how they've had to rebuild after selling their TV company and the 3 different platforms complement each other almost symbiotically.

2.  When a company is disruptive it isn't valued on what it makes today but what it can accomplish in the future.

3. TheScore is in their growth phase. As they enter in more and more states they will incur additional expenses in connection with the expansion of their gaming operations and promotional costs. Even DKNG is not yet profitable. These costs will eventually decrease while their generated revenue continues to increase.

The BAAS model is a complete game changer and the battery swapping stations seem to be getting universal praise in China. They are amassing a cult- like following and continue to forge influential partnerships to build their swap stations on currently occupied infrastructure. To top all this off, Tencent is one of their biggest investors which means they will play a huge role in the coming years when entertainment within these vehicles will be big business the more we shift to self-driving.

You should maybe learn a thing or two about how Ark goes about their research and selection process instead of assuming it's a one person business and trashing the business and the woman who runs it because she happens to be religious. You found this out only two days ago. She's been running the fund for many years before that.

IE Pfe, BioNtech Mrna will benefit because the shift has gone to a booster model just in the past few week, so that's a stream in income going forward, so I personally went to hold though I did unload some MRNA in the $170's and even caught some at $180 in the past 2 weeks.  But now it's a hold on the rest  And I own JNJ.  I was looking to dump XL once I got to even.  I also want chargings stations exposure.  I bought BLNK for that this week but guess what?  XL just landed a big charging station deal with the Inlanders, so bingo, I went to a hold.  I knew they convert gas vehicles to electric but didn't know they were involved in the stations themselves, so perfect for me.  The other 2 things are when do they report and is there an X dividend date coming up. If they are set to have a decent quarter and have been flat, that may move the stock.  I try to be aware of that.  It's a lot of cross referrencing but I try to keep up.  Dividends, if you reinvest, and you held through the x date, you'll sell and then end up with a sliver or a few shares.  Sometimes it's better to wait and sell the entire lot at that time.  I always always, look at where it was before last March so 1 year, 5 year and Max charts are important.  UAL is a good example.  I am up 125% and most people will sell.  I want the stock back up closer to where is was and it has another $25 to get there.  Add to it the insane exuberance as people dive over each other to own this stuff, I think it will hit an all time high once we are fully open so I likely will do even better.  I bought all new holding between Mar - even the into fall.  12-13 holdings are over 100% unrealized gain.

1109,DCF," In summary there are three main reasons why the 10 year yield matters.

1. Future rate increase.  This impacts the discount factor in DCF.  Especially impacts high growth companies (i.e. companies that promise cash flows far in the future).  As rates increase, it exponentially decreases the PV of cash flows far in the future.

2. Equity risk premium shrinks.  As bond yields increase, all else constant, the risk premium that you get paid for investing into risky assets (equities) shrinks.  Hence money moves into fixed income and out of equities ... Impacting all equities.

3. Reflation.  The yield curve is steepening (and TIPS-TBond spread is widening).  This indicates strong inflation expectations.  More importantly, it's expected that inflation will be driven by demand/consumer spending.  As a result, it's becoming very plausible that companies beaten down by COVID will have a resurgence.  Money then flows from those high valuation/low earnings companies into the beaten down valuation/high expected earnings company.

* Increased volatility 

* High value/low earnings company begin to lag rather than lead

Personally, ARK is hard for me to take too seriously. They've had a lot of success for sure, but their Tesla analysis in particular has always struck me as fairly ridiculous/not based in reality. But I'm of the opinion that Tesla is in a bubble right now - if someone is a believer in their ability to grow and expect them to dominate the EV market moving forward to a huge extent (and expect them to do well with autonomous driving), then they'd have a different take on it.

1171,TDA," I think selling here is the play as well.  This thing moves slow and I would be worried about buying an end of week $25 strike.  Selling is a good strategy if you expect neutral to mild  movement

If you're mildly bullish, you can sell puts with the expectation that they expire worthless(since you expect at least a little upward movement).  You need to be ready to buy the shares if you're wrong though (or to buy back the puts for a mild loss).  You can also sell covered calls, and choose your strike at the point where you're comfortable selling.  This way you still profit even if she doesn't make it up to $25.  Buying calls will be more lucrative if you think it's really going to take off, though.

If you sell a call and it expires ITM with TDA, your shares will automatically be sold at strike after close.  You'll see it reflected in your account sometime over the weekend, and definitely before Monday.

Same thing with selling cash puts, if the stock dips and ends ITM, you will automatically be assigned (they automatically buy two shares at strike -potentislly on margin if you don't have the cash) after close on Friday, and see it reflected in your account sometime over the weekend.",holt5301,1,/r/stocks/comments/lrpetg/rkt_earnings_tomorrow/gonbycb/,0.049,0.841,0.11,0.9337

The bigger number to care about here is the fact that 95% of the available shares are owned by institutions.  That leaves nothing for the short sellers to cover with if they have to cover.  They could roll over the position but the borrow rates right now are 33% which is also a signal that there is huge risk on the short side right now.

So my theory is the shorts are manipulating the price so that when shares come online (i.e. DG sells some of his 95% stake), they can be scooped up at the deflated price. It gets even more tin foil hat when you look at the prices that the funds have been buying shares at... over half the float has been bought within $0.01 (I can't get that kind of price stability at Walmart)

1225,PLUS," I'm not really an ""options guy"" either, but I think I can answer these questions:

1. Can you sell the contract early?  Yes, in fact you almost always WANT to sell a contract early. If you wait until it expires, it loses all of its extrinsic value.  (Look up the terms ""intrinsic value"" and ""extrinsic value"" on investopedia, and it will help you understand some of this). Guys who do options a lot will usually determine an exit price. They buy the contract, watch for the value to increase to the pre-determined amount of profit they want to make and then if and when it gets there, they sell the contract. People who make money in options rarely let a contract expire.
2. Why would someone offer to sell their shares at a discounted rate?  I'm not sure I understand this 100%, but I'll give it a go.  Let's say you own 100 shares of xyz company.  You want to sell a covered call to make some money.  You think the value of XYZ stock is going to drop.  Selling a covered call is a ""bearish"" move. So, the price of XYZ is $100 per share.  You sell the calls for a strike price of $90 per share because you think the price will be $80 before the option expires.  You get the ""premium"" for the contract. The value of the premium will vary, but included in that value is the difference between the current price and the strike price, plus a little bit for taking the risk. (This is if you sell an In the Money call). If the price of XYZ company goes down, you make money. If it goes below $90 per share, the option will not be exercised and you'll make the premium PLUS get to keep your shares. Free money.  If it's above $90, you essentially sell your shares for $90 per share, but you've already made the premium, so your total amount is going to be just over $100 per share.  If the price goes up, you still sell your shares for $90 per share plus the premium, but you miss out on any increase in value that you could have made on the increased stock price.

1247,UK," I too use HL and the fees are huge although there aren't any great alternatives in the UK. I may switch to Interactive brokers but haven't had a look at the fees.

&#x200B;

With HL if you make 20+ trades in a month, the fees for next month are £5.95 a trade so that could bring your costs down. But this would cost you £240 just in trades and when your overall account value is £500 this is silly. 

&#x200B;

Unless you're investing at least £500, preferably £1000 into each stock, do not use HL. 

You could try Trading 212 (I think it has an ISA) or Freetrade but the availability of certain stocks may be limited, prices may be delayed and customer service could be questionable.

Send me a note if you want any questions answered. I have been using for years. I have 19 portfolios running with 80 plus stocks in those portfolios. 

Most of the setup is straightforward a little not. 

Is F/X an issue or is most of what you do in USF? I do half in USF half in CDN, so deciding how to do the reporting in different funds was a choice I needed to consider upfront. Stockmarketeye allows you to trade in many currencies but only allows one currency of cash in each portfolio. So I split my multi currency accounts at my brokerage into multiple portfolios in Stockmarketeye. It creates no hassle going forward only a choice you might need to consider at first entry.

Also in the transactions (buy, sell, dividends, etc) take note of the flag for “UPDATE THE CASH BALANCE”. You will want that on after your initial portfolio is entered and you are doing regular trading. But initially enter you historical data with that flag off, then enter a current cash balance, and then turn the flag on... easiest way to enter data without trying to determine your cash balances way back when.

And don’t be afraid of making mistakes, the transaction are easy to delete. And don’t be afraid of experimenting, the backup/restore function works marvellously. 

I have portfolio groups set up for each family member whose portfolios I track and portfolios in each group for each of their accounts (401k, RRSP, TFSA, LIRA, pension, etc)

I don’t use the automatic download from my brokerage but only because the don’t have that relationship with Canadian banks. Not sure I would though... I find the entry of trades, dividends, etc. to be informative.

I’ll stop here. Have fun.

1297,TD," OP just to clarify, since you're being provided some misinformation from other commenters.

A ""good faith"" violation is completely broker dependent.

If you free ride on say TD, you can call in or log in online and remove the violation. If you get caught free riding again within a 90 day time frame, by federal law the broker has to freeze your account and restrict your trades to closing positions only. Some may offer 3 ""good faith"" chances to ""reset"" violations, within a one year time frame. 


If you free ride on a Wells, Chase or other similar banking platforms, they just send you an email and your frozen for 90 days with the closing positions only restriction.

So please don't listen to people saying it's ok to do or to not worry, that is a gross misrepresentation of the facts.

Regulation T is a Federal Law, and not something your broker gets to arbitrarily decide how many chances you get. Your broker is forced to comply with Federal law. This is a highly regulated industry.

1299,ABC," Sure, I'd be happy to clarify.

I'll use your example

>Let's say I sold $100 of ABC today so I now have $100 of cash (unsettled funds). Tomorrow, I use $50 of the unsettled funds to buy XYZ. As soon as I see the remaining $50 of unsettled funds become settled, am I clear to sell my position of XYZ without violating Reg T?

&#x200B;

No, you would likely get a violation. But I'll explain why. :)

It takes three days to settle. When you sold your shares of ABC, your account is almost always credited immediately with the proceeds.

If you then used half of the unsettled proceeds to purchase XYZ, you still never fully covered the original purchase of ABC, when you bought XYZ. Even though you only used half of the proceeds to buy XYZ. That means half of your position in ABC was left unpaid for.

If you turned around and sold your position in XYZ on the day of ABC's settlement, you are still in violation. Why? Because you have now sold XYZ before the purchase was settled. You just sold shares you didn't actually own yet, again lol.

The short answer is no, because basically, you're selling the shares of ABC and XYZ before they are paid for / you actually didn't own them yet.

The reason why:

In a cash account, you don't actually own the shares you buy until the purchase trade is settled. So when you sell said shares before settlement, although the money from the sale gets credited to your account. You're selling shares of something you don't technically own yet to cover the purchase instead. Then using the proceeds to make another purchase, of something you may or may not own again lol.

The reason the Federal Reserve Board outlawed this is because when a trader freerides, they pay for the opening trade using money from the proceeds of the sale instead. Which can be problematic for very obvious reasons.  One of the biggest problems with freeriding is that many investors don't know they're doing it or that the possibility of doing something like this is illegal.",SmartMoney19,1,/r/stocks/comments/lrpoom/t2_question/goojf10/,0.072,0.818,0.11,0.9156
