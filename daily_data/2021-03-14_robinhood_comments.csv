5,DD," Obviously, not financial advice, and you should be doing your own DD before trusting anyone on the internet but-- Roku seems like a rocky investment at the moment. Keep in mind, pre-pandemic it was closing as low as 87 bucks and it seems to have soared due to streaming interest. Right now volume is super low, around as close as their ipo and nearly to the point of being underbought, and their MACD implies they're having the strongest downturn in the security's history right now. I would personally hold off on investing, as it seems incredibly volatile at the moment with no realistic reason for it to turn substantial profit anytime soon.

Again, not financial advice!",lalloisoleucine,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/m4hwgv/what_are_your_opinions_on_roku/gqwybxx/,0.049,0.798,0.153,0.9273
6,TV," The value is all thanks to their ad click-throughs.  Whatever method they're using for targeted ads has proven more effective than anyone else.  Every cheap TV seems to come with Roku enabled, too.  Roku also means 6 in Japanese.",UFA_in_Training,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/m4hwgv/what_are_your_opinions_on_roku/gqxegdb/,0.0,0.801,0.199,0.8268

8,TV," Same thing happened to me, I was looking for my first ever stock to buy and saw my roku TV, did some research and thought 40 was undervalued. So I put in 1000 and then told my grandpa to put in, we ended up selling at 160? It was a nice profit for the both of us, but kinda sad I didn't hold for the 400 a share",BlackFireOCN,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/m4hwgv/what_are_your_opinions_on_roku/gqxl64o/,0.053,0.851,0.096,0.2357
