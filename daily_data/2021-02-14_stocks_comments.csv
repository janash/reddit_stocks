0,DD," Yes. This is such good advice.

I started a subreddit to house all DD related to a single ticker so I could fully vet both the bull and bear cases in one place.  

The stock popped (maybe prematurely - on literally no news/catalyst), and a bunch of people FOMO’d in, then they left immediately when it dropped back to the slow and steady growth trend line.  

Remove emotion from your investing strategy, and lean HEAVILY on DD.  

Are you one of the total 20% of “day traders” who historically have beaten the market?  

If not, slow and steady DCA into fundamentally sound/derisked securities is probably the best way forward.  Know what catalysts are upcoming, and how they may change valuations.

What’s gonna make me rich quick? I’m gonna put a thousand dollars into weed stocks and I’ll get rich, they’re going to all go up!”. I’ve also noticed that a lot of new investors are so quick to claim that any jump in prices are “short squeezes” when if you asked them to explain what they mean they’d be at a loss for words. All this influx of new, clueless “investors” is doing is bringing more money to the big guys and making the retail investors look bad. So, if you’re brand new, please, for our sake and your sake, don’t pretend like you know what you’re doing, admit that you’re clueless( everybody is at first, I’ve been doing this for four years and still have ALOT to learn), and be open to any advice, especially here.

If you invest well for 15 years and then one of your genius plays goes south and you lose 50%, congratulations your retirement is fucked. You’d need a 100% return to make up for the 50% draw down, and what’s more likely to happen is that you’ll take on more risk and lose it all.

23,OR," Just practice and do your homework.  Then practice some more and only put a SMALL percentage in YOLO AS YOU OEARN.  Learn how to calculate leverage (TL/TNW) and always look at cash flow statements (there’s tons of accounting tricks a company can use to adjust earnings on an income statement).

P/E is a great marker too.  If a company has a P/E of 10.0 it means the price is 10x the earnings.  So if there was only 1 share in existence at a price of $10 and net earnings are $1 annually it will take 10 years to make back your $10 if the earnings stay the same every year. In other words use the P/E as investment years required.

With a stock price of $816.12 per share and earnings of $0.64 per share TSLAs P/E is $816.12/$0.64 = 1275 meaning it would take 1275 years to get your investment back IF earnings per share stay at $0.64 for that time and you bought at $816.12.  But if earnings were $64 then it would only take 12.75 years.  This is NOT A VALUATION OR EARNINGS PREDICTION for TSLA, just an example to show the math.

52,IMO," One piece of feedback for you. You didn’t identify the purpose of your investment thesis.

Is this a growth targeted investment, a capital preservation and income investment etc...   My process is similar in many aspects to your approach, however I start with this fundamental designation then some of my focus points in latter steps differs as a result.

Simple example... Does my growth target investment have desirable sales and profitability growth, and what is the market size trajectory, and investment target’s market share.  Alternatively for a dividend stock target, what is the free cashflow growth... how do market conditions and target’s position support future dividend growth.  You get the idea I imagine.

53,DD," This is basic overview. You need to go much, much deeper for a sound DD:  
  
**Revenue:**  
Revenue should be a deep analysis of the drivers: volume and price. These are the two fundamental ways to grow and it is integral to have a deep understanding of how these make up revenue. I ALWAYS recalculate revenue using the drivers identified in the 10K. Helps me assess the quality of revenue—volume and price going up? Solid revenue.  
  
**Balance Sheet:**  
Should be predominately focused on ratios and identifying risk factors. Lots of goodwill? Massive risk of write-offs. Lots of long-term debt? Might have difficulty meeting obligations.  
  
**CASH FLOWS:**  
Arguably the most important financial statement and OP left it out. Not saying OP is not to be trusted, but the omission makes me question their experience.   
On the cash flow statement it is important to grasp the cash flows from operating. We **always** want that positive. We also generally like to see cash flow from financing negative—meaning they are paying off debt and not issuing new capital.  
  
**Market Capitalization:**  
Market Capitalization is far more important than price per share. Honestly shocked OP included that in their DD. Market capitalization tells us how much a company is worth (outstanding shares x current price). This figure helps us compare companies and evaluate if there is room to grow.  
  
**Investor Presentations:**  
Tells you management thoughts and highlights the good and bad. A lot of useful information is found here.  
   
**Future outlook:**  
What does the industry look like in the future? Is there sufficient research on how big this industry can become by market cap? What are the risks? Barrier to entry, obsolescence, etc.",rCPA_ONLY,5,/r/stocks/comments/ljo7d3/how_i_do_due_diligence_on_a_company/gnfyak7/,0.079,0.768,0.154,0.9767

58,EV," Rule number one in investing is buying a stock that's undervalued... You really want to get in to one that is in the brink of something cutting edge... That will get them an advantage over others... Take Tesla for example of even apple.... Tesla one of the first EV car manufacturers.... Apple one of the first two smartphones that also has imessages which no other phone offers.... It's a gamble in a sense, cause not every new thing is going to take hold, and it's also a long term thing like bitcoin took them already a decade to set in... 
Currently you have one obvious undervalued market, and that's pot. So the question is who is best set to profit quickly from that?? Most people say American companies, but that's not true in the least. If they can sell here already then legalization isn't going to help them since they are already seeing to the 15 States allowed, and until all the others legalize then they won't see an additional profit at all.. Sure they will be able to use cash for transactions, but that's a minimal revenue increase. 
A Canadian company however will see an immediate increase, because they will get an immediate revenue increase by selling to those 15 States they couldn't sell to before. So what companies will benefit first from legalized pot in the US will be those Canadian companies that already have partners here in the states that can start selling their products to t those 15 States when it happens... That's what pot investors need to be looking into, because that companies are highly undervalued right now with LEGALIZATION going to happen this year....",Grand-Oil9984,3,/r/stocks/comments/ljo7d3/how_i_do_due_diligence_on_a_company/gnfv2tx/,0.03,0.868,0.103,0.9613

95,ANY," looking back and asking ""what if"" begs for disaster in the future.   
gains is gains. 

if you achieve returns > market, you are killing it. 

what I like to do with individual stocks: buy, set price target according to very ""conservative"" precictions. punch it my sell order and be done with it.   


if it reaches close or near this price range and I stil wanto t hold to ""ride it out, I change my sell into a stop loss. and be done with it.   
I would - if broker offers it - set up a trailing stop loss on ANY individual stock. and be done with it.   


I cannot repeat this often enough and I know it´s not sexy to say on a forum that supposedly is about stocks, trading and such.  
there are several studies that prove

97,GME," First of all, set a stop loss, so you can relax and ensure you don't lose more than you're comfortable with. 

That covers the ""what if's"" with losing. 

With winning, I'm the same. It's FOMO. What if's. 

This doesn't help you though, because you can't go back in time. What if I bought tesla stock when I was 13? 

What if I bought GME at $3 and sold and $450? 

Woulda, coulda, shoulda. 

My general rule is that at 25% gain, I'll withdraw about 10-25%. 50% another bit, and so on until I pretty much have my original investment in. 

Then I just leave that, maybe take 50% of it as profit or to try another stock, and then I forget about it ""in case"" it skyrockets. 

It lowers my gains, but also reduces the risk. Generally investing, the lower the risks the lower the gains.

123,GME," I’m new to the stock market as I started over the GME hype but after losing money, I decided to do a full, in-depth research on how the markets work so that I wouldn’t repeat the same mistake and just chase a quick buck. I’ve always wanted to get into it so what better time than now. 

With the more research I make, and the more tips I get from actual people deep in the stock market, the more I feel this is the smartest way to go about it. 

Invest into something, once you feel the time is right, sell half of your owned shares to collect profit, and hold the remaining 50%.

124,DD," I'd say do your fundamental and technical DD to set entry and exit points and stick to them. 

And be honest with yourself with your actual risk tolerance. Are you okay losing 10% for the opportunity to make 20%? Or would you prefer to risk 5% to make 10%? Once you get used to these calculations you'll start to understand the type of tickers or opportunities you feel comfortable jumping into. 

Let your risk profile guide your targets, not the other way around. If you are risk averse, then you'll have to settle for singles and doubles. And conversely, if you want to swing for the fences, then you should be okay with striking out. 

And finally - like the other folks here, you need to let go of unrealized gains. Definitely look back and see if you missed something in your analysis, but sometimes things just don't go according to plan and you just need to accept it and move on. Sometimes it's just bad luck. You can't control the price, so there's no point fretting about that. What you can control is how you approach the situation.

I'm a novice but selling at a gain (even with loss of potential profits [bc with the possibility of potential profits comes with it the risk of greater potential losses too]) is still a good strategy! Being conservative with your stocks is wise. Why take unnecessary risk?

If you feel so compelled, sell when you did and buy back a couple shares at the dip if it really bugs you. But otherwise you setting the bar at a 10% decrease is not a bad strategy and you shouldn't beat yourself up for it.",PantyPixie,10,/r/stocks/comments/lji5zb/investing_a_year_and_what_i_learned_the_hard_way/gne6xyx/,0.092,0.641,0.267,0.9729
126,DD," As someone who bought Shopify at $40'ish and sold after a 15% dip around $100 (it's now at $1400+), I feel your pain. after having several experiences like that, I revisited the ""stop loss"" strategy and shifted more to a buy and hold.

If you want to go with a buy and hold, try limiting your position size (5%??) of your overall portfolio. Do your DD before and ensure you have a clear thesis for the company and understand why you're buying. If the stock starts to plummet, you can revisit your DD to see if any fundamentals have changed or if your thesis still holds. If your thesis still works, hold. If not, sell. 

By limiting your position size, you will naturally obtain some level of diversification in your portfolio and if the one stock plummets, your overall portfolio value wouldn't be too impacted (a 10% drop would only be 0.5% of your entire portfolio assuming 5% limit). Of course, once the stock grows 100%+, you might want to re-evaluate since  the one position might become a significant portion of your overall portfolio (rebalancing) but I generally enjoy watching the winners continue to grow. It's all dependent on your risk tolerance.

131,DD," Read up on technical analysis and candlestick charts. Pattern recognition is never perfect, and past performance doesn’t dictate future, but the law of large numbers, as well as the predictability of human behaviour means that patterns will continue to form. 

In the end - through your fundamental analysis you will make a valuation for the company and set a price target for yourself. Based on that price target, and how the stock has been trading, you’ll be able to estimate the potential price band/movement the stock could take, as well as the expected duration of time it will take. 

If you can comfortably do the above, then a whole world opens up to you because you can start separating the good DD from the shills. Should always run the stock back through your own analysis to ensure that you believe in the play and determine what your specific strategy should be.",incognism,2,/r/stocks/comments/lji5zb/investing_a_year_and_what_i_learned_the_hard_way/gnfru64/,0.012,0.868,0.12,0.9542

133,IMO," My guess is that when interest rates start rising again, a disproportionate number of zombie companies are going to go belly up creating much more unemployment; this will trigger the next market downturn. 

Until then, investors are going to continue buying equities instead of treasuries and bonds, further driving up market volume and prices.

IMO, predicting when this will all occur is a fool’s errand, so it’s best to stay the course and dollar cost average your investments and retirement funds.",EevelBob,687,/r/stocks/comments/ljowe9/does_anyone_else_think_a_catastrophic_market/gneqt31/,0.036,0.82,0.145,0.8265
134,IMO," Two things to look out for: when spending starts to flow back to non-public entities. All the diverted spending from small business has moved to Costco, Peloton, Apple, etc (just examples obviously).

And secondly, crash is too broad of a term. Read a great piece in the WSJ arguing that there may be some equity value decline in certain stocks, but not a crash like 2008, that was all driven by leveraged balance sheets by the banks.

I agree with your point, crash talk is overblown. Lots of companies are making stupid profit right now.

135,GDP," I think people are misunderstanding what could potentially be a move from equity into bonds as a market crash. Right now most funds can only put their money in  equities or real estate because global interest rates are practically zero.

When interest rates start to rise which probably won't happen until next year then money will begin to move from equities to bonds again.

The zero rates we are seeing is creating a bubble in equities but only in certain sectors. This bubble will eventually burst when global interest rates start to rise. It won't be catastrophic but it'll be bubble burst.

Rates will only start to rise when inflation starts to pick up and GDP growth is back to values pre-covid. This could take a year or couple years and the rise will be gradual. Central banks understand this and don't want to cause a crash. They will slowly raise rates and allow for market corrections in stages.",Cstooby,9,/r/stocks/comments/ljowe9/does_anyone_else_think_a_catastrophic_market/gnf6ucb/,0.05,0.806,0.144,0.9465

138,HAS," Here is a personal anecdote that explains how crazy the market is right now. I’m a college educated millennial that makes 45k. I’ve always been mad at myself for missing out on opportunities in the 2008 crash.

A few months ago I realized that people on Reddit who were doing YOLOs were making cash. A ton of cash.

I applied for a 10k discover personal loan online. Was told to call them. The rep asked why I wanted the money. I was honest and said I wanted it to buy stocks. I thought for sure I would be denied after that. Nope. They sent me the money.

I opened a robinhood account and followed the YOLO stocks on WSB while maxing out my margin which Robinhood basically gives everyone for free.  It's like free money to amplify your gains.  A week later I had 30k and paid back the 10k.

I kept doing YOLOs and kept winning. I started dumping a lot of my gains into an asset that can't be talked about here.

Today, a few months later, I turned that 10k loan into 380k.

I’m not dumb enough to think I’m smart. I just threw money and maxed out margin where everyone else was mindlessly. I kept winning because the market just keeps going up and it's like you have to TRY to actually lose money. I’m still doing it.

By all odds I should be broke and in the hole 10k. I’m still in fucking disbelief myself.

The gov and fed are propping all this up. They are flooding the markets with cash. It’s intended to go to the rich who own most of the stocks. Myself and a minority of my generation are just intercepting some of this money.

This is what we should have done in 2008. Back then I would consider myself greedy and unethical. The last 10 years of being fucked by boomers though? No regrets and no fucks given. I’m taking the money and I hope more millennials join me.

I also know that this insane level of basically free money for the taking is unsustainable.  I hope I'm smart enough to get out of all of this in time, because I think a mega crash HAS to be coming.... I'm not the only one doing this.....",FunctionVoidSmall,2,/r/stocks/comments/ljowe9/does_anyone_else_think_a_catastrophic_market/gngsk70/,0.111,0.747,0.142,0.9184

142,NOW," Regardless of the fact that many ""overvalued"" companies are making good money, I think a crash is coming.  The problem, of course, is predicting when.  ""Soon"" is subjective, of course.  It could be 2 years from now.  Could be the end of the year.  Could be next week.

Prices have skyrocketed since the COVID crash.  Look at price graphs--they are practically vertical.  There are many theories why: stuck at home so free time and higher savings, people think it's safer because the crash happened to it is time to make money NOW, etc.  However, regardless of the cause, the later effect will be the same: people will be afraid to lose these huge, rapid gains, and so when it looks like the market might be dropping (whether from increasing interest rates, some big event expected to cause market drops, or even just enough people deciding to grab some profits and move it into something safer), there will be massive sell-offs and a corresponding huge price drop.

Here's the thing though: the mindset that drove this recent price surge might still be there, and once markets drop by, say, 30% you could see a massive influx of buying again.  Apple dropped to $90?  BUY BUY BUY!  Then you'll see another dilemma: is it time to buy a big dip or is it a dead cat bounce?

Dangerous times are ahead for investors.

I think the only way to avoid a crash is to have a prolonged period of lower price growth so that earnings can get caught up some more.  Basically opening a valve to ease off the pressure.  However, with the low returns on bonds and the general bullish mindset of investors, I do not think this is likely.  Future average growth WILL be lower, but it is more likely to be from rapid growth, big crash, then rapid growth again than by just slowing growth.",ptwonline,1,/r/stocks/comments/ljowe9/does_anyone_else_think_a_catastrophic_market/gnfrrm6/,0.1,0.803,0.097,0.6277

If the poster refuses to acknowledge any downsides, hasn't looked into their financials beyond ""much sales, such wow"" without looking into costs, and have no clue what the moat is or how the competitors are doing, there's a good chance they're trying to pump somthing.

261,GDP," Typically corrections happen because of some catalyst.  2020 was Covid.  2008 happened because of tons of mortgage defaults.  There was rampant fraud with mortgage lenders and buys and inflated home values, and that all cam crashing down that triggered a financial wide crisis.  In 2000/2001 it was dot coms that raised money and went public at unbelievably stupid valuations, eventually many of these couldn't meet milestones and funding dried up and many went bankrupt, causing a market crash.

BUT in 1987, Black Monday, the market dropped \~23%!!  And it wasn't clear why the market crashed.  There's tons of theories, but not a single catalyst that triggered a wide sell off.  Maybe people just felt the market was over valued?  It took a whole 2 years for it to fully recover and get back to pre Black Monday levels.

Could something like that happen again?  Yeah sure, but who knows.  There are more safe guards in place, but you never know.

For now with stimulus and economy coming back online after covid I'm betting the market is not crashing this year.  But.....

287,GE," Thanks for your comment.  I believe what you are referring to is the market for diagnostic ultrasound most likely.  The point I’m making is that I believe that this market will expand dramatically.  Diagnostic ultrasound is beyond the reach of most physicians due to the cost.  An entry level GE or Phillips diagnostic ultrasound costs approximately $40,000.  A good diagnostic ultrasound will run over $100,000.  As a physician I personally purchased a sonosite ultrasound unit for $48,000 in order to perform ultrasound guided procedures not diagnostics.  One of the things I find most fascinating about this company is the subscription model for image storage this will be recurring revenue for butterfly which will escalate dramatically with increased adoption.  I do not think it would be unrealistic to expect that most of not all med schools would require their students to purchase a point of care ultrasound for training purposes.  The butterfly unit is by far the best POC ultrasound that I have used.  Others that I have tried were either 3x the price or much heavier and much more cumbersome to use (if interested google Arthrex synergy ultrasound and you’ll see why I mean).  This is just my opinion but again as a physician I’ve seen nothing like butterfly’s product.

They are avoiding expensive growing methods by using a creative approach announcing the other day that they will be introducing synthetic cannabinoids for the Canadian market for a jaw dropping 10 cents a gram:

https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/cronos-to-sell-lab-grown-pot-products-in-canada-this-year-ceo-1.1556188

Aside from Cronos, I think the ancillary cannabis companies are the way to play weed stocks because they don't contain cannabis and hence allow listing on the most liquid exchanges such as Nasdaq and institutional money can pour into these cannabis related names now/today as opposed to being shut out of other companies that contain cannabis because institutional money usually has mandates to not allow investing in something that is Federally illegal:

Hydrofarm (HYFM) - IPOed in Dec and a leading hydroponics manufacturer and distributor

GrowGeneration (GRWG) - leading hydroponics retailer

Agrify (AGFY) - recent IPO and a hydroponics growing solutions services provider

Weedmaps (SSPK) - unique cannabis play on the intersection of tech and cannabis. A type of Uber, Amazon, Yelp and Shopify all rolled into one for cannabis products. A SPAC that will turn into WeedMaps during sometime in the 1st half of this year. This one is special.

The psychology behind this type of though and consumer action is crazy to me, but it is what it is 🤷🏼‍♂️

Many of the companies I’m looking at now have leadership with strong brand building backgrounds.  Especially as it pertains to the emerging popularity of drinks and edibles, as they are easier to build a brand around vs. flower.

There is as much push as possible from the industry for branding here as well, however strict advertising restrictions exist for the cannabis industry much the same as for tobacco.  This is controlled at both the federal and provincial levels.  I imagine should legalization occur at the US Federal level,  they might look at something similar?  In all honesty I am not up on your regulatory bodies and how they would play this.

I think you could expect to see the traditional tobacco industry shifting towards vaping products as crop cultivation is not comparable.  This would provide exposure to nicotine and THC/CBD for them.

388,TLRY, I bought a stock a couple years ago and it happened to be towards the peak and it dropped from $6 to $1 over a span of a couple months. It sat under $2 for about a year. I never thought much of it as I only had 10 or so shares. Last year it started to go up from $2 to $3 and then back down. I thought about buying 10 more shares to average down but didn’t do anything. It started to show more news and numbers. When it got up to $3 I grabbed another 10 shares and now it’s in the $4 which is my average. I’m not sure much anymore where the company is going to go. There was a lot of talks about partnering with Coca Cola which caused it to go up. There hasn’t been much movement but looking to sell when it hits $6 to get a small profit and more than likely break even. I would say keep holding since TLRY has gone up and down. If you don’t like that it does that I would sell when it gets back to the price you paid. Hold out and see what happens. You can make small investments to other stocks to sell when they go up to double your money or make small profits. Any profit is a good profit and over time you can start getting a nice portfolio together. This isn’t expert advice just things I’ve thought of and came across over the years. When you sell or miss out on a stock move forward to something else and don’t look back. These are my thoughts and experience. Happy trading and good luck in the future!,Valcenik,1,/r/stocks/comments/ljwdff/what_to_do_when_youve_fucked_up/gngr12r/,0.014,0.832,0.154,0.9926
389,DD," TL:DR Below.

Number one, I am going to assume you learned a lesson about going balls deep on a fast moving,  hyped up stock.  If not, a quick rule is don't jump on a fast train if you don't understand what is propelling it.

Without knowing more, specific advise cannot be given.  So I would say quickly do some serious DD regarding the company and it's projected future near and long term.  Good learning opportunity. 

If it's over your head, accept that.  Don't make the situation worse trying to figure out a play that you may not fully understand.   Pull out and lick your wounds, then move on.  There is no shame in admitting defeat on an investment.   If it is not going to make YOU money, dump it.

Since you're new to it, re focus on a few  long plays, avoid hype and random internet advice (even this, it's only one dude's opinion:) .  Remember that if stocks or an industry are being hyped, ask why and by who.  FOMO is a killer.  Use a few safe long plays to learn the basics first and don't  go balls deep into investing with more than you can walk away from.  Losses suck, they will happen, will always seem like a surprise, and you should always be in a position moving forward where you can say to yourself, ""that one didn't work out"" and not be shitting  yourself about it.

TL:DR, Pull out, lick wounds, learn, move on.

They've more recently put focus into cryptocurrency and stock trading, and their cash app growth has been tremendous. If I were to guess, people buying the stock at these prices believe that stimulus cheques will keep coming in and that will generate lots of trading volume for stocks and crypto making SQ more money than some analysts would project.

* In 2019 they launched a number of features which makes it easier for people to build their own stores and online checkout features. Perfect for the gig economy which is growing, and with COVID-19 demand increased.
* Their app allows for P2P transfers, buying and selling stocks and bitcoin, and make payments through their app. This service has taken off in the last year. They brought in a ton of money from bitcoin and the cash app. And these services are growing.
* In the third quarter of last year they reported a profit of $794 million. An increase of more than 59% than the previous year. Revenue was up over 140%, at $3.3 billion.
* And they just bought Credit-Karma so now you can do tax-prep for free on the app.

460,IRS," Wash sales are IRS rules, not SEC. They apply to buying a stock within 30 days *before or after* selling at a loss. You bought the 1 share you have left less than 30 days before your loss, so you have a wash sale for 1 share. If you sell the remaining share, you can claim the loss. (This is to prevent someone from buying replacement shares when a stock drops in value, then quickly selling the original shares to claim a loss.)

You can buy back in if you want. The next five shares will be part of the wash sale if you buy within 30 days of the sale date, so their cost basis will look weird. Other than that, there's no harm in wash sales (other than deferring the tax treatment of the loss).

There's nothing wrong with dollar cost averaging shares. Wash sales are triggered by selling, not by buying.

When you have a wash sale, the loss isn't allowed (yet), but it's instead added to the cost basis for the shares you hold. So, when you eventually do sell, you can claim the whole loss. That's why your cost basis looks weird.

There is no ""wash buy"" rule.",TheWizardOfFrobozz,2,/r/stocks/comments/lje12n/confused_about_wash_sale/gnfmdwr/,0.098,0.802,0.1,-0.3865

Idk where you're getting your information, but standard practice on Wall Street is 3 - 5 years. I prefer 5 years because remember your last year + 1 influences the terminal value, which should reflect a solid run-rate for your company in perpetuity. A longer DCF may be necessary if it's going to take a while for a company to mature for ex. a start-up.

DCF stands for discounted cash flow, which means you're valuing a company based on their future free cash flows adjusted for time and risk. So it doesn't matter if the company started in 2016 - 2017 because your model is driven by future fcf not the past fcf. It would be harder to project cash flows obviously due to the limited history so you just got to make your best effort with the assumptions and consider multiple scenarios such as a bull, base, and bear case.",ricke813,5,/r/stocks/comments/ljeq31/are_dcf_models_useful_if_you_use_a_5_year_forecast/gnd55yj/,0.047,0.81,0.143,0.9561

475,EDIT," Looking at its financials on LazyFA, it looks great. Looking on macrotrends, it looks totes sus. Somehow its foreign status allows its collection of SEC filings to not include a 10K or a 10Q.

On [its most recent form 20-F](https://sec.report/Document/0001564590-20-019287/#ITEM_8_FINANCIAL_INFORMATION), if you scroll down a little more than halfway, to page F-5, you see that its operating net income is solidly in the red, and they pull it into the green on their net income by way of a line item called ""Gain on disposal of available-for-sale debt investments"".

I don't know what that means, but it sounds like a finite source of income that is not sustainable.

My suggestion: read through that 20-F. Understand what it talks about. It's a whole bunch of pages and words. It seems like there's a whole bunch of nuance. You're right that there are a whole bunch of numbers on the surface that seem attractive. But there are enough strange things in play that it could be specifically engineered to appear that way.
