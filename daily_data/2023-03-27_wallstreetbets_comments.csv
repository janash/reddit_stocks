44,AI," I don’t think it will eliminate half the UX jobs in the next 20 years. If anything it’s going to create an entirely new field for UXers to thrive in. 

UX is human centric and focused heavily on human computer interaction or human and process/product interaction. AI will need to be able to interact with humans in a way that makes them feel comfortable and meets them where they are. They also need to be honed and tweaked to make sure they’re useful for the jobs humans want to get done in the way they want them to get done, which is all UX. 

Machine learning can definitely help with this but I believe we’ll still get better results faster with proper UX methods being applied. 

Also the vast majority of people are still very uncomfortable with the idea of having cameras in their homes, speakers in their homes, and other devices which track their movements, words etc…  throughout their house or at work etc… I know from UX research I’ve been doing on Wifi based motion sensing and spacial mapping via wifi. 

The other things that AI still isn’t great at and likely won’t be for some time are accurately identifying human emotion, while also observing what a human is doing, while parsing the words they’re saying, and their body language. It’s also not great at tonality of voice input and being able to read between the lines of what people say, what people do and what people say they do. Which being able to identify and dissect those things  to ask the right questions at the right time and in the right way is a huge part of being a UXer.

72,OR," I wasnt saying housing is a problem.  It's a consequence of a problem, ie, people living on credit.  When they lose the ability to pay it snowballs.  A few bills slip here or there, or get pushed.  Then late fees and reconnect fees start getting applied and before you know it youre upside down with no way to make those bills OR the mortgage and if either the bank you financed through is taking your home, or the bank you got a home equity loan through takes it.  And it starts snowballing from there.  Houses hit the market and no one is buying, values depreciate and so forth and so on.  I dont see a housing crash.  I see a credit crunch and the market flash crash on it.

Iirc, credit is still going up even while average spending goes down.  That should be a big red flag for people because it means people are taking more loans and getting more credit cards and still not spending as much (which arguably implies all that credit is going towards necessities).",VOID_MAIN_0,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/123fgpj/why_wont_this_shit_crash/jdv7qfo/,0.084,0.798,0.118,0.7661

85,RE," That's just being frugal. FIRE is two things commonly stuck together.

Financial Independence is having enough of a cash and equity pile that you don't need a specific job. You can get laid off and be fine for quite a while or just retire whenever you want. You can be FI without RE. 

Retiring early doesn't require you to be frugal at all. General rule of thumb is 15% savings rate for retirement. Contribute more and you will be able to retire early. 20% savings rate will lead to RE and will be a minimal impact on your current life, if there's any impact at all.

My retirement savings rate is 20% to 401k, 4.4% to pension, and about 10% to my house down payment fund. I am in no way frugal.

*Some* people are both frugal and FIRE oriented, and those people often have like 70% savings rates. That's a small minority of the group.

86,META," Rates higher for longer. That is what the market is scared of. If rates go higher businesses stop their growth cycles to manage their current debt. They then lay off employees to hunker down and survive. Some business lay off workers to boost balance sheets (TSLA META etc). The whole world economy has been growing based on debt nobody pays for anything in cash.

Also conveniently omitted was the Fed hike/cut info from the 70/80s when the Fed was also fighting persistent inflation.

All those things you mention are true. But the effect is not immediate. And the rate cuts are specifically to try to spur things so we don’t crash. But like I said typically it’s too late. Because the fed is always backward looking at data. So they don’t act on either side until it’s too late.

240,FC," Does anyone notice how bad the SVB balance sheet is/must be?   I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.  Sure, this probably isn't too bad of a deal for FC, but it should say something about the wider banking sector and everyone's balance sheets.  The amount the FDIC is getting stuck with is nuts. 

First of all, the actual price is ""Rights linked to the stock of First Citizens, which could be worth up to $500 million."" So... very little at most, or maybe nothing at all.  And we were told there were a lot of bidders that they needed to weed through?  What, a bunch of $1 bids?!  

Second, the FDIC is retaining $90 billion in assets?  FC didn't even want half of the fucking assets on the balance sheet?  

Third, ""The deal for the bank...[included the purchase of about $72 billion in loans, at a discount of $16.5 billion....]"".   Uh... WHAT? and the other $90 billion was left behind?  This was the 'good' $72 billion?  Is that 77% off?  This looks more and more like a bailout of FC to be honest.  FDIC said ""who needs the cash from SVB balance sheet?  we can shift those deposits over to FC and stuff a hole in their balance sheet so we're not doing this again in North Carolina next week.""

Fourth, the FDIC and FC share in losses from here 50/50 up to 5 billion, so the FDIC could still lose another 2.5 billion.

248,FC," There are non-hold to maturity, which are treasuries and MBS that are marked to market regularly.  Then there are HTM assets which are also treasuries and MBS that they don't mark to market.  Then there are loans that are by nature HTM unless the bank is unwound - which also happen to have the longest duration risk.  My guess would be that they left behind $90 billion in loans written at 2.5% because it is a waste of capital to tie it to that income stream. 

The way you compensate someone for the increase in rates since the contracts were written is to drop the price (price and yields inversely correlated).  So the HTM assets would be handed off at a steep discount (if they were handed off at all) to compensate FC for the new rates.  If kept on FC balance sheet, they will continue to gain/lose based on market rates.  Alternatively, they can be sold immediately into the treasury/mbs market which just turns to cash and is put on the balance sheet (they would realize no loss, personally, from this sale because the FDIC already took the loss when re-sold to FC).",rick_moronis,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/123lsfj/first_republic_stock_up_24_as_fr_deal_for_silicon/jdvoogb/,0.068,0.885,0.047,-0.6486

Yep. This is exactly why I made the post. It's plastered all of mainstream media that the fed will cut rates which will be a disaster for your average tax payer. To those who have access to debt, lots of it and quick, they'd balloon the supply of cash before it devalues once the fed decides it needs to stimulate the economy with rate cuts.

We'd see an massive explosion upward in the stock market and in about 4-5 months, hyper-inflation followed by a massive drop.

I'm not sure if you've taken a class on economics but we're already in a recession and people want to think we're at the bottom of it.

319,OP," The creation of money is entrusted to the Treasury, specifically the Treasury Department's Bureau of Engraving and Printing.

The Fed takes that money and shifts it to/from bank reserves as needed and as ""appropriate"" for the economy.  The buying and selling of bonds is part of that process.

The Federal Reserve system is just a multi-stage queuing system for release of capital into circulation, they do not create money. In fact, think about the exact phrasing you used... they ""Purchase"" bonds. What do you presume they buy them with if there's no money before the act of purchasing them? Seashells?

When certain types of economists (primarily monetary policy hawks) say ""the Fed prints money"" it's a function of ideology to make a claim about money entering circulation (not the same thing as creation, and that's important to how this system works).

Here's the rough flow:

Treasury -> Fed -> Banking system -> Consumers/Corporations

Treasury -> Fed: Where the money the treasury prints is actually introduced into the system.

Fed -> Banks: Where money enters the secondary reserve stage. Hawks say money is ""created"" (enters circulation) here, which is purely an ideologically-inspired falsity, it is not literally created/printed here.

Banking system -> Consumers/Corporations: Where money ACTUALLY enters circulation.

The reason why the last stage matters most is because money can go into bank reserves and never get released, due to FDIC capitalization requirements, Fed clawback expectations, or bank risk considerations.  The second stage is really conditional as to whether it influences circulatory flow, as it may or may not influence lending margins.

But in any case, in the context of the OP, the Fed does not create money, its entire job is to prime the Reserve system with capital as needed and control the flow of that money to promote economic growth and price stability. Anyone thinking it doesn't serve the liquidity needs of the banks doesn't understand the structural purpose for the Fed. (And it's OK not to understand that, most people don't... even many economists.)",Moist_Lunch_5075,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/123bvq7/how_do_we_know_if_the_fed_secretly_prints_money/jdwc968/,0.019,0.904,0.076,0.9298
320,AA," Both are already backed by existing treasury issues and come from the real economy, just prior to when the Fed steps in. Corporate bonds and MBS are still typically par-neutral margin investments for the Fed, even if they don't have guaranteed return to the same reduced risk level as treasuries.

When you buy real estate, the money for that comes from existing bank holdings, including against cash and long term bond returns, as well as return from credit holdings. The risk with MBS is more short term contraction, which is why the Fed buys them when banks become insolvent due to short term reduced valuations, but these are already balanced against existing issues.

MBS holdings are collateralized and typically go up with inflation (which the Fed has a hand in through its distribution responsibilities) and AAA and AA corporate bonds basically don't typically fail. The Fed has not bought junk bonds until 2020, and then it was only as an emergency act to shore up the junk bond market and avoid a bond valuation collapse from wiping out large portions of the economy.

But the offset for junk bond risk is higher yield, and even junk bonds typically don't just evaporate. The risk is higher during an economic pullback, but even junk bonds typically deliver on a high enough basis to suggest that this isn't just free money. And again, the Fed has a direct hand in the likelihood of that outcome, so for them the risks of taking on macro risk are not the same as for you and I.

In all, the investments which don't evaporate at lower value (which will be the vast, vast majority of them) should result in excess return to the Fed and then roll off the balance sheet without being replaced. The end result of that is actually the longer term removal of capital from the circulating economy. In other words, it's all about the accounting here.

This isn't to say that in the short term these acts don't increase money supply and cause potential inflation, it's just to say that the Fed is not actually literally printing money or creating new digital currency to do this. And because of bank risk calculations while it may sometimes have the effect of increasing lending if the other factors (like rates) are ideal (as happened with housing in 2020/2021) but in most cases won't increase bank real economy credit lending (which is what mostly happened around the rest of the credit market during that period, which is why consumer debt and spending didn't shoot up the same way housing spending did).

The reason for this is simple: If a bank is calculating loan provisions against total holdings and guaranteed return, the Fed trading out capital for bonds only creates excess capital in the sheet on the speculative margins, and that's balanced by loss of potential return for the holding when kept to maturation. Some institutions obviously do worse at predicting these fluctuations than others (See: SVB) so the net impact to current lending isn't zero, but it's not the entirety of the delta either... in fact it's probably not even most of the delta on QE funds provisions.

And that's expressly because in many cases, the FDIC requires the funds be held, and larger banks won't pass stress tests if they don't hold the capital against their obligations.

&#x200B;

What's weird is that the ideologically-driven assertion that the Fed is ""printing currency"" actually kind of hides the real, and much more interesting, problem with QE:

It's not broad excess capital that is the problem, it's the potential for margin fuckery... I.e. multi-tiered leverage. If the Fed buys MBS, even at low risk or difference to the sheet, it offers some banks the chance to stack leverage by ratcheting up the systemic cost and thus inspiring further Fed involvement.

If the problem were just the Fed printing money, then the impact to the economy would be broad and a mathematical reduction problem where wages going up negates the outcome of higher competition for goods based on capital. \*yawn\* LOL

But these speculative stacks of leverage create volatility and those resolve through deflation of the inflated asset since the capital backing them is stacked multiple times. So these inflated valuations don't stick without continuously being pumped up... but that's not creating money, that's overvaluation, and without the act of liquidity injection, they WILL come down.

&#x200B;

But that's not printing money any more than using margin in a trading account to cross-invest is printing money.",Moist_Lunch_5075,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/123bvq7/how_do_we_know_if_the_fed_secretly_prints_money/jdwx4kz/,0.084,0.823,0.093,0.6756

331,RIVN," I read these every time you post them and I still don't understand how I take that data and turn it into action. 

I'm looking at the cheap puts. Can somebody please help fix my understanding? New-ish trying to make sense of how all the pieces fit.

Stock - The stock, I got this down.  

Put IV - Looking at the stock price fluctuations over the next year, the Put IV is an estimate at the strength of which the stock might move.  (A $100 stock with a put IV of 3 is expected to stay close to $100, but a Put IV of 75 is expected to be wildly different?)  

Direction - Not sure. Positive is bullish and negative is bearish? Is the amount the strength in that direction? That doesn't seem right to me because some of the #s contradict the Put IV then.

Past Move +- - Total amount the stock has moved up and down over the last 4 weeks? If it goes up $10 today and down $5 tomorrow, would this show $15? 

Priced Down Move - Not sure on this one. Can't figure out how to apply it to all of my other guesses. RIVN for example says -44.14 but the stock is trading at 13.7. A year ago, it was at 50-ish. In both of those scenarios a move of that much seems off so I know I'm misunderstanding the data.

Put premium - I get this one, too. 

So, taking all of my definitions.. uh, fuck man I don't know. I better go back to the drawing board and read some more.",completelypositive,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/123sztz/best_options_to_buy_4_weeks_out/jdwpz8b/,0.107,0.851,0.042,-0.9684
332,RIVN," My bad guys. Let me answer this here and try to answer it permanently in the future.   


**Put IV** \- this is just a known market value that your broker would return if you went and looked at puts, for that stock, 4 weeks out. IV = implied volatility. How much will this stock move? It is implied by the price people are willing to pay for options. 

This point above is probably the single most important thing to understand in options. 

**Direction**: looking at the past price movements, and where relative strength index is, and how many more people are buying up calls as opposed to puts, and some other bullshit... I net out the recent direction of the underlying stock according to these factors. Of all the numbers represented in the table, this is the most subjective. If you have ever seen regards color lines on their charts (technical analysis) - then you can understand that this ""direction"" value is like a weighted sum of the top 5 factors leading people to color lines on charts. I just net it all out and bluntly say negative numbers are bearish and positive numbers are bullish. Keep in mind, all it knows to calculate are numbers from the ""past"" and it makes the general assumption those ""trends"" will continue.   


**Past move:** this one is a bit more complicated, but it is a ""cone of probabilities."" that is why you see a + and a - before the number. In the past, stock X has whipped up and down a shitload. The daily move say is 3% on average either up or down. Ok so what happens if in the next 4 weeks it moves up 3% every day? Then the upward bound is quite high. Same applies to the lower bound. This is a logarithmic approach to the standard deviation of returns. Big numbers = this stock moves a lot! Small numbers = this stock don't move much. ""If it goes up $10 today and down $5 tomorrow, would this show $15?"" - no. Remember this is a 4 week lookback, not ""yesterday."" it also isn't a simple x - y = past move. It involves standard deviations and some big brain things - but this is the correct way.   


**Priced move:** there are many ways to interpret the priced move, and stocks that really move a lot, like RIVN can distort these values. Sure RIVN can't move down more than the stock is worth and so that one looks a bit ""off"" but it is in fact how the match works out. 

*Implied* [*volatility*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp) *is the market's forecast of a likely movement in a security's price. It is a metric used by investors to estimate future fluctuations (volatility) of a security's price based on certain predictive factors. Implied volatility is denoted by the symbol σ (sigma). It can often be thought to be a proxy of market risk. It is commonly expressed using percentages and* [*standard deviations*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp) *over a specified time horizon.*  


Just realize... when we look backwards at historic price movements we do it in terms of standard deviations. When we look at implied vol, we have to use the same methodology to compare apples to apples and so... we do. 

The insight here is to look at if the historical vol is greater or less than the implied vol. The answer to that question, when comparing apples to apples, is used to determine if the option is cheap or expensive.   


TLDR: if you are personally bearish, buy the ""cheap puts"" on the stocks you like that you think are going down. Inverse that if you are bullish.   


Pro tip - you want to diversify your plays here so you would be better off making 4-5 trades off of this report than you would going ""all in"" on one.

333,FCNCA," First Citizens owns CIT, a middle market finance company and equipment lessor, which it acquired out of bankruptcy following the company's collapse in the 2008 financial crisis. CIT's assets are overly exposed to underperforming credit in a potential recession and FCNCA is now taking on additional bad credits with the acquisition of the SVB book of pie in the sky startup financing and troubled commercial real estate loans. Apparently SVB book of business was so unwanted that the FDIC had to accept no cash, no equity, and only future option appreciation to get some troubled bank to buy it.

345,SO," I the in-between that btc experiences (asset vs currency, and yes on the balance sheet money is an asset) is that it’s usage isn’t fully defined (practically speaking, not literally). 

For that to happen, the USD basically needs to fall in order for btc to establish itself as the global currency. That just is SO unlikely, and even in the event that it starts to happen, it will get shot down the same way Gaddafi did when he tried to switch to gold. 

So in short, two things need to happen:

Step 1: The states basically needs to not be the global powerhouse that can strong-arm the world into using their currency. 

Step 2: There needs to be consensus on the replacement of the global currency. 

I’m unsure either of those things are very likely to happen, because even if step 1 happens, step two just takes way too much power away from the big boys.",chostax-,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/123imjq/the_banking_crisis_is_bullish_for_crypto_says/jdwrp2g/,0.013,0.97,0.017,0.1779
