And premium is also less on blue chips, or any stock with relatively little volatility. There is no free lunch. The market prices premiums according to the perceived probability of them being OTM. You think you can consistently predict this better than the entire market? Why should I believe you?

66,BABA," BABA gapped up 6.3% on 2021-01-20 and up 6.5% on 2021-04-12. It's not that unusual.

It ended the day 9.3% up on the previous close 2021-04-09, up 5.1% on 2021-03-09, 5.5% 2021-01-20, 5.5% 2021-01-05 and 6.3% on 2020-12-29.

It has also gapped down by even higher numbers over the last year, it opened down 10.9% on 2020-12-24 and closed that day -13.3%. It's quite volatile.

But typically, the bounces back come after these dips. It's certainly in a dip at the moment, now it could go lower but it could also bounce higher.

5% movement in BABA, either way, really isn't that unusual.

78,RTX," Rule number 1 of the running the wheel is to only invest in stocks you don't mind holding long term. People become gamblers and convince themselves that the company they're wheeling is a good long term hold up until the moment they begin to fear assignment.  I've been running the wheel on WMT, MSFT, RTX, COST, BABA, MRK, AMD, CRWD, NET, BAC, JPM, WFC, and so far it's gone very well(not BABA lol). However my whole game plan is buy and hold so the CC I sell are usually way OTM and make $50-150 for 30 dte and I only sell when the stock is at an ATH, near it, and/or I'm up over 25-50%. The premiums aren't as juicy on BAC, WFC, and a lot of the safer companies I mentioned but I'm not in it for the premiums, I just want to be sure I'm making something rather than nothing during the process even if it's pennies. I was selling MSFT CC at 260 when it was at 235 and it somehow got there after the nuance acquisition but then it teetered off cause thats what happens after huge spikes you just have to be patient. In the case that it doesn't, always keep half your stash and sell CC against the other half.

93,AR," Approving this post because it does involve valuation discussion. HOWEVER, I'm approving it with guidance.

EV/EBITDA isn't to be given deference *over* DCF both because Enterprise Value is derived in part from market capitalization (circuitous and uncorrelated) earnings is easily manipulated, cash flow is not. In the financial analysis world, after performing several different valuation methods, we don't then simply disregard or discard the one that doesn't give us the answer we want.

When DCF vehemently disagrees with EV/EBITDA, that's a good suggestion that EBITDA is misleading or being massaged through accounting treatments to make earnings look more consistent... and that's precisely what's happening here. This is an indicator that we need to look at the financials more closely.

Their AR leaped, their unusual items doubled year over year, and their earnings are buttressed by, for the last three years specifically, enormous increases in investment (read: non-operating) income. What are these investments, exactly, and if we can replicate their returns why would we invest in GOOGL knowing that their operating margins are actually flat and the DCF analysis is therefore spot on.

We buy undervalued companies because of their durable competitive advantage. There are other companies allocating investment capital for a higher return whose stocks are trading at a discount to fair value, so GOOGL isn't particularly attractive in this regard and they are definitely not undervalued.

From a Graham perspective, GOOGL is trading at around a 10% premium. That is the antithesis of a margin of safety, which is also the reason to lean toward, not away from, DCF analysis.",th3cr1t1c,1,/r/investing/comments/ndfhbz/googl_what_am_i_missing/gyc71kk/,0.044,0.866,0.09,0.8588

Additionally, your bear case which has the business de-rating by 5x (or more) on a multiple basis with flat revenues and decreasing margins (implying EBITDA would be declining) somehow only has the stock down 9% from current levels. I find it hard to believe that is correct. Hard to see how EBITDA declines and the multiple de-rates significantly with the value staying roughly flat to what it is today.",MMcDeer,1,/r/investing/comments/ndfhbz/googl_what_am_i_missing/gyd2ask/,0.069,0.845,0.086,0.79

144,DCF," Thanks for the post. I have worked in corporate finance for a long time.  Intrinsic value still has a lot of benefit when investing, but it’s just one pillar of analysis a well rounded investor should consider. 

DCFs are great if you trust your assumptions or have a sensitivity range to gauge various margin assumptions. It’s also predicated on you being able to accurately calculate a company’s WACC, which isn’t always easy. But if you have a robust DCF and understanding of how a business will invest in capex, it can be quite useful in determining present value to investors. The problem is we don’t all have inside knowledge of a company’s plan to, say, open a new production facility, so it’s hard to forecast many of these items. Terminal values are also a bit tough because the wrong assumption can throw your present value askew. 

That’s why various valuation approaches should be considered. Looking at comps is helpful because it shows where others in the industry are trading. Looking at rates is helpful Because the value of a company’s earnings are seen relative to other investments. 

If you want to talk more about what goes into a good DCF and focus on that methodology, there are a lot of debate points to be discussed.",IcyYachtClub,33,/r/investing/comments/ndd7oo/calculating_intrinsic_value_personal_price/gya0tzi/,0.046,0.73,0.224,0.9921

147,ALL," Well this is a potentially explosive post. 

A well crafted DCFs will give some indication of the intrinsic value of a company.

I'm a CPA and about a year ago I started doing a Msc. in Finance because I had a lot of questions around value, capital markets, capital decisions, etc. which I was interested in exploring deeper and the internet alone wasn't doing it for me anymore. 

Now that I'm about 1/2 through the degree, I am convinced that if you are about to buy into a stock, you should consider ALL angles such as: understanding the company the company, its accounting fundamentals, do a DCF to estimate the intrinsic value, perform sensitivity tests to check for variability of your estimate to changes in a few parameters. Then you should also look at the stock's industry and finally, as someone pointed below, you have to understand the macro-context which might lift/sink assets prices (current vs. future monetary policies, fiscal policies, regulation, anti-competitive outlook, etc)

Once you have all of this in hand, there is no guarantee of being wrong or right but you can at least feel like make an informed decision. Which then leaves the final question: what is your time horizon and/or exit strategy?

Therefore, to answer your original question, I don't think you are putting effort in something that doesn't matter. If anything you are deepening your understanding. Also, for kicks and giggles, if you do enough research to at least attempt a DCF, you probably already have done more 'due diligence' than what I have seen get posted on WallStreet Bets as 'DD'.

The valuation of that company however can significantly depart from its intrinsic value which Damodaran has covered extensively on this personal blog. This particular post on the GameStop saga is a great example of Damodaran's explanation on Value vs. Price: ([http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2021/02/the-price-value-feedback-loop-look-at.html](http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2021/02/the-price-value-feedback-loop-look-at.html)). 

I'm a CPA and about a year ago I started doing a Msc. in Finance because I had a lot of questions around value, capital markets, capital decisions, etc. which I was interested in exploring deeper and the internet alone wasn't doing it for me anymore. 

Now that I'm about 1/2 through the degree, I am convinced that if you are about to buy into a stock, you should consider ALL angles such as: understanding the company the company, its accounting fundamentals, do a DCF to estimate the intrinsic value, perform sensitivity tests to check for variability of your estimate to changes in a few parameters. Then you should also look at the stock's industry and finally, as someone pointed below, you have to understand the macro-context which might lift/sink assets prices (current vs. future monetary policies, fiscal policies, regulation, anti-competitive outlook, etc)

Once you have all of this in hand, there is no guarantee of being wrong or right but you can at least feel like make an informed decision. Which then leaves the final question: what is your time horizon and/or exit strategy?

Therefore, to answer your original question, I don't think you are putting effort in something that doesn't matter. If anything you are deepening your understanding. Also, for kicks and giggles, if you do enough research to at least attempt a DCF, you probably already have done more 'due diligence' than what I have seen get posted on WallStreet Bets as 'DD'.

As someone else wrote, DCF’s have a lot of uncertainty in their own right, especially with early stage tech; they are just one data point of the puzzle. Absolutely should do them and have assumptions. I think people avoid them because 1) They’re time consuming to put together 2) They’ve never heard of DCFs or 3) They don’t see the value of DCFs. Most don’t even read the 10K’s.

151,DCF," Great post. I agree with your bullet points. 

I feel like I'm not qualified/experienced enough to have a reliable opinion here.

I'm not an expert but I have a post secondary background in finance, so I am familiar with what your talking about and I was forced to do a lot of this in school.

DCFs are worthwhile at the very least because you'll learn the financials very well. DCFs are tricky because of all the inputs. The inputs, for me, become educated/my best guess. Sometimes slight changes to the inputs can make rather large changes to my final value. I am never very confident in my DCF results. I also find DCFs very time consuming. I don't often bother doing them. (should I be embarrassed?)

Basically, I have a hard time deciding on input values and I find them time consuming. If my output value is questionable, I don't want to invest the time.

Maybe I should keep practicing though....

DCFs are definitely not the only part of buying a stock. I read the 10k, look at years of financials, understand the story of company, the industry, and ""where"" I think the company is going during the time I want to hold it. I calculate growth rates, EV/Ebitda etc etc etc

153,DCF," I've passed the CFA Level I exam and am familiar enough with DCF to do them.

However, the biggest flaw is that DCF attempts to boil down the valuation into an infinite series of cash flows. This is a great approach for modelling bond prices, which have a contractually known and fixed coupon. For equities you have to make a lot of assumptions about the cash flows, before you plug them into the formula. This can lead you to coming up with a very **precise** valuation that is not **accurate**.

A company is basically an army of humans trying to relentlessly optimize the performance of the business (and customers reacting to these attempts). It's a huge source of variance that cannot be captured by the formula for a DCF.

In fact there is a strong argument that DCF is the WRONG valuation method for equities. Due to the above mentioned ""optionality"" of a company (investing in new products etc), they actually have a DCF / cash flow component AND an embedded options component, which should be valued with Black-Scholes instead. Omitting the options value would lead you to significantly undervaluing most tech companies. Nobody really does this however, AFAIK.

157,DCF," This is a very good answer.  Been in corporate finance 20+ years and this is mostly what I would advise with two added points:

1.	The estimate is a triangulation of various methods such as DCF.  It is not a prediction that requires precision so much as it is a bar underneath which you would purchase at a significant, not small, discount.  Graham called this “margin of safety.”
2.	Most people without a sufficient competency in accounting/finance and at least $250,000 in investment capital shouldn’t be picking individual stocks.  They will not beat an index fund consistently. 

All of these components you bring up are things that took years of education and experience to learn.  You cannot teach the average person to sniff out every kind of irregularity on the financial statements because they’ll go down a checklist without really understanding what other irregularities could exist on the financial statements. They will keep coming back with more questions to add more checkboxes to their checklist rather than developing a foundational understanding that advanced analysts rely upon to extrapolate any irregularity that can exist.

186,FCF," Im not saying the numbers are wrong. Im saying your application of them is completely incorrect

What you did was calculate the present value of the forecasted FCF of the business 10 years from now. Why would you do that? Is the business not going to generate FCF for the next 9 years?

What you should have done is use the Sum of a series formula and then estimate a terminal value using the sum of an infinite series.

S = a(1-r^n) /1-r where r = r2/r1 = 1.3/1.25 = 1.04. In other words, the present value of each years FCF is equal to 4% more than the preceding years.

Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses? just mortge which we pay

this mught be bit messy looking so i apologise in advance.

from UK. dad (59) and mum (54) have 20k from savings to invest.i want to put in world tracker of high divdend and support them with their retirment to keep money in the market rather than let them use the cash till its gone

what i want to do is put it in safe global etf like vwrl or split between couple ones like booglehead style where i can just let it sit and grow.

questions. 1 - would it be better to put the money in all world tracker 5 years for them then to a high dividend etf for them when they retire or put in in growth focused etf and keep it there but we pay them cash instead to support their retirment? so in a way our monthly input to the market would go to them instead? am thinking 1st option and we cover extras through our cash?

2 - which brokers are good to focus mostlyon etfs for lowest fees 1st and stocks 2nd. i know about vanguard world tracker but i also hear about SCHD as 2 good etfs to put and forget.

3 - would you put it all in 1 go now then dca after ot start DCA now? am thinking spread it over 6 months

4 - would spliting between different all world tracker matter? eg vanguard, ishares etc? also what are some other methods other than stocks to look t like bonds or any other?

5 - is there a simple and easy etf method to invest and forget version for the UK?",eliszotaj2,-2,/r/investing/comments/ndk90w/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gyb4fjt/,0.042,0.833,0.125,0.9772

I'm (37) European with a fairly stable income decided to start investing at the end of January. I decided to allocate around 10% of my monthly income with the main objective of building up a pension fund. I don't have big debts besides the mortgage which takes around 15% of my monthly income.
As I don't have to pay taxes in capital gains (up to 100k and from there only 4%) decided to start with mostly stocks. I don't plan tu touch the investment unless an urgency happens as I can pay all the other things with the monthly income.
I can tolerate some risk but want to play something with the right risk/reward balance.
At the moment I don't have anything else, besides the house I'm paying mortgage for.
My main problem is that my experience with the stock market is not going as supposed. I mostly only invested in companies that I know because of my job and believe in (biggest positions are in Semiconductor: ASML, Micron, NVIDIA, AMAT; Renewable: Enphase, sunrun; EV: Tesla; e-commerce: Amazon, SE Ltd; Health: TMO, Teladoc and Fintech: eToro SPAC. (Biggest positions are Enphase, Amazon, TMO and Nvidia). However, since I joined, I ""lost"" around 25%.

I know it was a bad moment to start investing and likely the market will continue a bull run that will make me recover the lost. But I start wondering if the stock market is the right place to invest or should I try something else or some other strategy (i.e. instead of investing monthly, accumulate funds for when I see a crash/big correction).

On the contrary, the stocks I mentioned were ""easier"" to pick as I know them - i.e. the semiconductor ones should have a good grow, ASML has a monopoly for chip manufacturing machine and we are in the middle of a chip shortage. Or Enphase, as I recently put solar panel at home, I studied it quite a bit and they have no competence in the market at the moment for inverters. All sound very good in my head, but then, reality hit with for example a -22% lost in ENPHASE, so I'm now doubting whether the stock market is really that rational (is it ""just"" gambling?).
