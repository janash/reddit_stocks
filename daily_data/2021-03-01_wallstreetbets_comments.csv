35,OR," “It's important to note to the newbies on here who may not understand the importance of holding:

You may be tempted when you see it jump (entertain me for a moment) up to $20 tomorrow at the opening and think to yourself ""Holy crap, I can double my money!"" - and sell.  Perhaps you're thinking that doing so will allow you to 'buy the dip' that we always talk about, and prophecy will surely happen this week as the price goes to $20, then down to $12; up to $24, down to $14, and the cycle continues.

Here's the problem: the more people who try to time it right and sell at the peak, hoping to buy the dip an hour later -- you are ensuring that the SQUEEZE never takes place, because you're giving the HF's what they need -- shares!  The more you sell high and buy low, the lesser the chance of this ever getting into the triple digits is less and less likely.

HOLDING IS KEY.

Would you rather sell at $20, buy at $10, sell at $30, buy at $20, and sell at $40 -- only to see the stock stall out at $40?  OR, would you rather HOLD THE LINE and see it go from $20 to $40 to $80 to $160 to $500?

THE KEY IS HOLDING.  I don't know how else to stress this.

Let's say OP is lucky and the price of GME moons to $1000 before the option expires. He can then sell his options for at least $1000 per stock or $100k per option or $40m in total. That's why people gamble with options, they act as a ridiculous leverage, but they're also incredibly risky because if like in this example GME doesn't reach the $800 price point, the option expires and OP just set $200k on fire.",freifick_muschi,23,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/luv2to/is_this_how_one_yolos_200k_on_400_x_800_march/gpa4d0a/,0.072,0.884,0.043,-0.3507

387,OR," “It's important to note to the newbies on here who may not understand the importance of holding:

You may be tempted when you see it jump (entertain me for a moment) up to $20 tomorrow at the opening and think to yourself ""Holy crap, I can double my money!"" - and sell.  Perhaps you're thinking that doing so will allow you to 'buy the dip' that we always talk about, and prophecy will surely happen this week as the price goes to $20, then down to $12; up to $24, down to $14, and the cycle continues.

Here's the problem: the more people who try to time it right and sell at the peak, hoping to buy the dip an hour later -- you are ensuring that the SQUEEZE never takes place, because you're giving the HF's what they need -- shares!  The more you sell high and buy low, the lesser the chance of this ever getting into the triple digits is less and less likely.

HOLDING IS KEY.

Would you rather sell at $20, buy at $10, sell at $30, buy at $20, and sell at $40 -- only to see the stock stall out at $40?  OR, would you rather HOLD THE LINE and see it go from $20 to $40 to $80 to $160 to $500?

THE KEY IS HOLDING.  I don't know how else to stress this.

They will adapt and continue to try to make money, as they should. As soon as GME price skyrockets, anyone with a brain can tell that the price is not sustainable, which means, the easy bet is to short it. That's what the HFs will do. So even if the HF's that shorted @ $40 go bankrupt, so what, there will be other HF's that short at $300, or $1k, or $100k or whatever meme price you quote, and they will make bank when the price falls back down.

Besides, HFs aren't even playing with their own money -- it's money that regular people entrust to them to try to grow it the best way he can. If that means shorting a failing retail store, so what?

613,AT," Everything can age well if you live in denial. The truth is, if you held previously and you're now given this chance to exit without too much pain, you should take it. AT LEAST, you should set higher stop losses than your previous losses. This way you won't even have to sell, if you feel that would go against the spirit. This is not betrayal, it's risk-management.

&#x200B;

>BUT...THE CAUSE???!!!

1. There is no cause.... There is only profit. This isn't /pol/
2. wsb are not the ONLY players in this battle. Your squad can refuse to retreat if it doesn't want to, but if everybody retreats except you, no one will mourn your stupidity when you get wiped out... If all 9.3 mill ppl here held, the price will still collapse this week. (either because the security will collapse or because, if it doesn't, it will collapse a good slice of the market).

&#x200B;

>Maybe I want to collapse the system! I am just such a rebel!

I find it funny that people who complained about (and suffered the most from) the 2008's are the ones most willing to start a repeat. If you think billionaires fear being slightly poorer billionaires, wait till you know the fear of a working man with a family of 4 on average pay.

&#x200B;

>B-But DFV is HODLIN!

You are not DFV. Following a hero doesn't make you a hero.

DFV has waited two years, his entry point is sub $5 and he is already a millionaire many times over. Losing 40k to him is probably the same as you losing $400. Or at least it would be if money was spent perfectly proportionally (which it doesn't. Losing $10 out of your last $100 is a lot more painful than losing 100k out of 1 million.)

&#x200B;

**tl;dr** Not encouraging you to sell, hold, or buy more. Just encouraging you to take care of yourself first. Everyone is, no matter what the mood feels like. This is not an agricultural cooperative. It's a corporate plantation. Some of you will come here, put money in, make efforts, and leave poorer so that others can sit back and get richer. Nothing evil here. It's the market. Lastly, your money is your work and freedom is not giving that effort to someone else for no reason. You are your best and worst advisor.

This isn't right. The float is around 115M, the total shares outstanding is 2B, with 1.9B owned by Gilbert. I agree that some sort of squeeze is still plausible however. I own RKT and am also rooting for it, but want to stick to the facts.

Also, the dividend will end up being priced in, so it's not exactly free money to just buy now and sell after.

789,RKT," I don't think that discredits the whole idea here. There are multiple pieces in play.

1. There's the dividend, which shorts could pay twice. The stock rose 5%, that's once. If the stock stays here and the dividend comes around they'll have to pay it out of pocket, that's twice. If the stock stays right here and then goes back down 5% ex-dividend it will negate the second time. But that's an if.
2. There's the buyback program, which represents about 41mil shares at today's price. Since it hasn't been deployed yet, if they deploy it between now and March 9th it won't go unnoticed in the price. That's double daily volume and would effectively increase the short percent too \~80%. That leaves about 29mil shares left, of which all of the people potentially piling into this trade could gobble up a major portion of.
3. It's a legit good company that you could easily argue should have a 20-100% higher share price.
4. The meme potential of a company that's called Rocket with the ticker RKT. This should not be underestimated.

This video helped me a good amount. 

A call is essentially you saying, ""I'll give you $50 flat to put dibs on buying GME at $69/share, you just have to give me until next Friday to decide if I want to do it.""

Then next Friday rolls around and GME is at $69,420/share, so you're definitely going to cash in on that dibs you called. For a $50 dibs fee, you locked in the price of $69/share. 

BUT, if next Friday rolls around and GME is currently at $0.69/share, you're definitely not going to buy any at your dibs rate of $69/share because that would be fucking stupid, so instead, you do nothing and all you lose is the $50 you paid to place the dibs.",calculuzz,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb407/rkt_ceo_forcing_shorts_to_pay_for_their_own/gpc6uok/,0.064,0.869,0.067,-0.368
802,CAN," No you dont, you CAN if you want sure. When a call option you have purchased is ITM (in the money) you can do two things.  1.  Sell it or 2.  Exercise it.

You just sell that option to someone else for a flat fee that you set vs exercise it and actually have to cough up the cash and buy the actual shares.  You only have to fork over the cash for shares if you EXERCISE it, which most of us smaller investors never do, we sell that option for a flat set price to a larger investor.  

https://www.investopedia.com/trading/beginners-guide-to-call-buying/

Closing the Position
Investors may close out their call positions by selling them back to the market or by having them exercised, in which case they must deliver cash to the counterparties who sold them.

Continuing with our example, let's assume that the stock was trading at $55 near the one-month expiration. Under this set of circumstances, you could sell your call for approximately $500 ($5 x 100 shares), which would give you a net profit of $200 ($500 minus the $300 premium).

Alternatively, you could have the call exercised, in which case you would be compelled to pay $5,000 ($50 x 100 shares) and the counterparty who sold you the call would deliver the shares. With this approach, the profit would also be $200 ($5,500 - $5,000 - $300 = $200). Note that the payoff from exercising or selling the call is an identical net profit of $200.",TheRealMrTrueX,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb407/rkt_ceo_forcing_shorts_to_pay_for_their_own/gpbuobl/,0.014,0.906,0.08,0.926

1007,BY," Let me address one thing specifically here.

> ""CNBC FAKE NEWS"", ""THE MEDIA IS BOUGHT BY HFs"" etc. I totally see where these claims are coming from (the strange amount of articles regarding SLV etc.), but endlessly repeating these phrases has not a single positive effect. In my opinion, these phrases aren't apolitical at all, and hence shouldn't even be allowed in this sub. I'll explain why: Not only in the US, but also in Germany, these phrases, portraying established media outlets as ""fake"", ""controlled by XY"", ""biased towards left/right"", are predominantly used by populist groups and people with tendencies towards the conspiracy scene. 

The fact of the matter is that in the United States, nearly all news media is owned by a tiny handful of billionaire conglomerates with very oligarchic agendas. It is in the personal financial interests of their investors and owners that the public *not* exercise any power, *especially* in the realm of finance. I am not even remotely involved in this whole GME deal, and even I in recent weeks have been inundated by targeted 'news' propaganda telling me how GME is terrible and it's financially irresponsible and how hedge funds and short selling is actually good and all the HODLers are actually destroying my 401k. 

Repeating that these sources absolutely should not be trusted and calling them out as the garbage they are helps people to not be gaslit by them, and therefore I would argue it does in fact have a positive effect.

You have to understand that I've lived in Germany for a short time, and your media is nowhere near as compromised as ours is, so you may not understand just how blatant the corruption is here in the US.

To your point on conspiracy nonsense, yes, these phrases and mentality are also used by conspiracy crackpots, but at the end of the day the only thing GME folks and conspiracy theorists have in common is distrust of official media. The difference is there is a plethora of objective evidence that shows media should not be trusted when it comes to financials.",dontcallmeatallpls,25,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lv90li/rant_for_more_fact_based_calm_and_thoughtful/gpb7kuj/,0.163,0.792,0.045,-0.9939

It is in the personal financial interests of their investors and owners that the public *not* exercise any power, *especially* in the realm of finance. I am not even remotely involved in this whole GME deal, and even I in recent weeks have been inundated by targeted 'news' propaganda telling me how GME is terrible and it's financially irresponsible and how hedge funds and short selling is actually good and all the HODLers are actually destroying my 401k. 

Repeating that these sources absolutely should not be trusted and calling them out as the garbage they are helps people to not be gaslit by them, and therefore I would argue it does in fact have a positive effect.

You have to understand that I've lived in Germany for a short time, and your media is nowhere near as compromised as ours is, so you may not understand just how blatant the corruption is here in the US.

To your point on conspiracy nonsense, yes, these phrases and mentality are also used by conspiracy crackpots, but at the end of the day the only thing GME folks and conspiracy theorists have in common is distrust of official media. The difference is there is a plethora of objective evidence that shows media should not be trusted when it comes to financials.",dontcallmeatallpls,25,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lv90li/rant_for_more_fact_based_calm_and_thoughtful/gpb7kuj/,0.163,0.792,0.045,-0.9939

1022,USA," your point about the media, and how you can't blame the media ""apolitically"" is very weak. it essentially boils down to, ""populists don't like the media too so don't say it"". 

the fact is, the media throughout this entire ordeal has either been 2 steps behind, actively spreading hedge fund propaganda, or accusing WSB of market manipulation/slamming the retail investors as stupid, etc. the fact is the media has been lying and unfair towards WSB, and I don't think you can smear someone as thinking that as being ""political"" because other people you don't like feel the same way. maybe people feel that way because it's true.

how about the 3 days straight that the news reported melvin closed their positions? 

also, to your point of short ladder attacks, there was a video of Jim Cramer explaining exactly how they work, and how the media will be used to release ""news"" to go along with the short attack. he used the TASER company as an example, where an article was published in USA Today discussing how the taser has the same voltage as an electric chair, despite USA Today's fact checking team disproving this. The correction was not added to the article until another week or so, long after the short ladder attack plummeted the stock's worth. 

[https://www.reuters.com/article/cramer-interview-idUKN2036292620070320](https://www.reuters.com/article/cramer-interview-idUKN2036292620070320)

I would link the video of Cramer discussing it, but it's been deleted everywhere after WSB got their hands on it.

One of the issues I've seen recently is that innocent mistakes in one post become mistakes in a second post. This happens a lot with data that isn't continually updated, but is rather reported bi-monthly/monthly/quarterly and the websites that report this data aren't always clear. Person A finds a data point on a website and links to it saying ""Look at this number, because it's still at this point we know these things are still happening"". When that isn't corrected, now you have more people who believe this data point is current and may bring it up later without the link where it could be corrected as old data.

1047,GME," To address your first paragraph, yes, ""fake news"" is shouted often- possibly too often. But you have to understand where these companies are. Fox News is often called ""fake news"" or ""faux news"" by the left regardless of their reporting- they are more right leaning and have made some serious hiccups, but they're slowly becoming a neutral ground as the general population is transitioning socially leftwards. They get the most shit from Americans not because they're the worst, it's because **they're the only mainstream media with a hint of conservatism.** It's unfortunate for them, but they have 50% of the population ganging up on them because it's trendy. On the other end, guys like CNBC can basically say what they want, as the other (right wing) side of America is either watching Fox or **not watching mainstream news**. So CNBC can get away with it. So don't be too quick to un-label ""Fake news"" because it often is- just look at their reporting on things like GME, or as far as Trump reporting. Whether you think Trump is a god or the devil, you can very easily see CNBC's opinion as a company towards Trump/the market/WSB, which is inherently unbiased reporting- not news.

&#x200B;

In regards to your second paragraph, I come from a very bias country (not America, although I live in the states now) and when you refer to "" In Germany, the established media is funded by the state through taxes and has an obligation to remain fact based and politically neutral as best as possible."" that's one of the worst things you could've said. You don't live in a perfect country- they will never report the news as it is, that's why private news works so well. If Fox says A and CNBC says B, you know there's a difference and you have to do the work to figure out the truth (which most people don't). If German media says ""A is what happened"", and you take that as the word of the lord, what happens if they lie?

It also has links to the studies themselves, so's you can check the source.

And to be honest, we get enough DD here which also warns about not going bonkers, not telling shit, not creating hope for a short squeeze this week when it may not come till April, and so on.

1054,IMO," thank you for your long answer. I can clearly see the positives of having private media. And as you said, I too think that the ""truth"" is most of the time found between two or more different perspectives. I think that a problem here are people, that completely ignore and neglect perspectives other than their preferred one and take it their point of view as hard facts. Regarding the system in Germany I once had a law professor who taught in the US for some time and he tried to explain that from your point of view, our system seems completely unfree and corrupt/biased and  I kinda get that. IMO the laws we have to secure a neutral point of view are quite ""ok"", but that could come from me being a law student and hence having a high trust in our law system in general.",boostedCLowNs,14,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lv90li/rant_for_more_fact_based_calm_and_thoughtful/gpaxo82/,0.048,0.87,0.082,0.707
1055,AP," I think giving platforms to people like Tucker Carlson discredits the reliability of Fox News solely because they portray it as news. Fox might be moving towards a more middle ground, but they still have and continue to provide platforms to hyperbolic, populist, contrarian pseudoreporters who spread heavy misinformation. Even setting aside politics, platforming scientific and medical misinformation on a massive scale already destroys any credibility Fox had. There can be (and are) disagreements in science, but it should be presented by qualified individuals in a peer-reviewed journal or platform with a healthy and objective discussion, not touted to millions of people to elicit extreme emotional reactions that endanger lives and further the anti-intellectualism movement. Furthermore, the political positions that Fox presents are constantly based on misinformation that is also touted to their millions of emotionally invested people. Do other (including left-leaning) news outlets do the same? Absolutely, and I'm wholly against it, which is why I try to mainly read Reuters and AP News as they have established high levels of trust and with the most neutral positions out there. But calling Fox ""faux news"" isn't wholly based on anti-conservatism, it's based on genuine problems within the organization that have existed for a while and continue to persist despite ample time and resources to fix them. I'm not saying that Fox, nor any of the anchors mentioned above cannot be correct or have legitimate opinions, but it seems to be the exception not the rule.

1432,OR," Yes you sell the contract. In fact, if you don't have the money to buy the 100 shares and sit on the contract till expiration your broker will sell it for you.

It's not hard to sell them as long as there are buyers. Low volume tickers may make it harder for you to sell your options and low supply can be an issue too.

For every call there is some person out there who actually owns 100 shares that sells a contract to buy those 100 shares at x price by y date for z amount.

He sells that to someone, who sells it to someone, who sells it to someone, until nobody wants to buy it OR someone wants to execersize. When they execersize the actual 100 shares will come out of the first guys pocket and he will receive in exchange the value of 100 shares at x price.

To buy a call you don't need x(100) you just need z which is the price the option is trading for you profit it has to go above x price by the amount you paid for the option. This gives you the right but NO OBLIGATION to buy 100 shares at x price. It allows you to control 100 shares for z price instead of x(100) which, if you're right about it going above x price, you will profit for each cent it goes over your break even price times 100.

The downside to options is if you're wrong on your bed about the price you essentially threw out z amount of money. When you buy 100 shares you're putting down more money but if the value of the share is drop you can always just hold them until it goes back up again you're not beholden to the date of the contract.",Snoo43610,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvbr0s/its_fine_i_hate_money/gpc5ide/,0.051,0.847,0.102,0.8885

1504,GME," My experience: GME wasn't moving for a couple of weeks so last Wednesday I started a full asset transfer to Fidelity from RH. A couple of hours latter GME started moving and I was very anxious that is miss out... I had no idea how long the transfer would take and if RH would drag their feet on it. I called Fidelity Thursday morning and they said (very nice and really tried to help) they'd already completed their side of the transfer and to call RH. Well, since RH doesn't have phone support I emailed them and got the canned 1-3 day response email. Still scared I'd be in limbo during the launch. Nothing else to do about it though.

1505,RH," My experience: GME wasn't moving for a couple of weeks so last Wednesday I started a full asset transfer to Fidelity from RH. A couple of hours latter GME started moving and I was very anxious that is miss out... I had no idea how long the transfer would take and if RH would drag their feet on it. I called Fidelity Thursday morning and they said (very nice and really tried to help) they'd already completed their side of the transfer and to call RH. Well, since RH doesn't have phone support I emailed them and got the canned 1-3 day response email. Still scared I'd be in limbo during the launch. Nothing else to do about it though.

I hate hearing that phrase because it's **usually** pure BS.

The stock price reflects the value of the company. A dividend directly takes the amount paid worth of value AWAY from the company to the shareholders. Therefore stock drops by the exact value of the dividend after payment regardless of any buy or sell speculation which either simultaneously moves the price or moves it in reaction.

The stock will quite literally drop by 1.11 on dividend payment (the cost of the proposed dividend for RKT). It may get washed out from regular movement but it will drop exactly the same amount as the dividend is paid ON THE DATE ITS PAID, not before and not after.

1685,GME," I don't see a gamma sqeeze....yet. January squeeze sqouze because GME had been trading sideways for awhile which reduced volatility.  This made OTM call options very cheap. As us WSB Apes started to pile in, more and more options became ITM. Market Makers had to accelerate their purchases of shares to stay neutral which accelerated the rise in the stock price.  That is gamma. This creates a feedback loop making the stock price go exponential.  Right now OTM call options are expensive which keeps their volume suppressed.  This equals lower chance of another gamma squeeze.

I assumed I was purchasing stocks with my own money deposited to my Ameritrade account. If I understand things correctly apparently that's not what happens and Ameritrade actually uses my money as collateral to purchase stocks on my behalf. I don't believe this means I'm trading on margin though. Or am I? 

I checked my Ameritrade account, and it is set up for Margin trading, but I don't believe I'm actually using Margin trading. 

Question is, if my account is set up for Margin trading, can Ameritrade still loan out my shares as mentioned here? There's no (M) next to my shares on my positions, but does Ameritrade operate the same way as Fidelity?

I don't have a lot of shares of GME (I'm not a complete retard, I did not buy shares with money that I cannot afford to lose) but I'd hate to think that my small amount of shares could be getting loaned out without my knowledge.

1814,UK," Directed advice is tough, but in this case, excluding everything regarding this specific situation, I will say if options go positive it's typically better to take the profits in those rather than shares first. 

Reason being you have to be ""more"" right with options than shares thanks to the time value decay. The other greeks matter as well, but for this considering time is enough. And the time decay accelerates in the final 30 days, which you are in. But with shares, if you are wrong by 1, 2, 6, 12, etc. months its not as painful. And you retain whatever intrinsic value there may be along the way. 

Think of it this way, imagine building two rail tracks towards each other that have to intercept, you only have to be correct along one horizontal plane (left/right) for them to align. Mistakes can be somewhat abated. But if you are building a tunnel from two ends to intercept such as the Chunnel that connect France/UK, you must be right in a much more complex three dimensional way. The chance for error is much higher. 

Stocks are the railway, options are the Chunnel, so if there is profit in the vehicle with a higher chance of a loss, I'd collect it. I've only utilized options for hedge position creation for this reason.",MitMassUndZiel,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/luzywt/were_gonna_need_a_bigger_float_gamestop_is_a/gpcf34f/,0.084,0.729,0.187,0.9781

The question is, how far will paper hands hold? If people start selling at $30 it will only reach $30-$50.... if they can hold to $100, then maybe we can reach the $300 mark..... if people look at the spike of 1/27 they might just fold at $25 cus they will get scared of loosing their scraps.... what people don’t realize is that AMC will jump to pre-Covid prices around $25-$30 so why sell at that when it’s worth that already..... 

On Monday the price will have a big spike with in the first minutes, I would say jumps to $18 and goes to $21 (don’t quote me on this) then it will drop to $15 (why? Cus HF will stop buying.... when selling>buy the prize drops... if the buys are almost at 0% then the big dip happens and all of the paper hands will fold because they see their “profits” drop by 50%.... then the split ordering begins where we have small spikes and dips...... what everyone needs to to is hold and if you can buy some more. When the big drop happens and people still don’t sell then expect it to stay low for that day, all day with more dips then highs but hold.... on the second day if everyone holds is when the HF need (not an option) to cover their shares so the frenzy begins.... 

Here is my prediction for Tuesday..... it begins with a drop, very considerable, if Monday closed at $11, I wouldn’t be surprised if it drops to $7.... the media will drive the word of AMC plummets after Monday spikes leaving hundreds of people paying the price, many small investors loosing their savings (what we all know is that you don’t loose money if you don’t sell at a loss)..... Do not sell (AMC, if nothing happens will be at around $25 when they open)... by 11:00 am EST we will see it go up from $7 to $9, then $12, then $30 (don’t sell at this price), then it might close at $80.... on Wednesday, they HF see that thousands of calls are now ITM and are closing on Friday..... on Wednesday is the big spike, there is a possibility that it can have a high of $300 closing at low $200.... Thursday, if everyone is still holding, it can hit a high of $500 and maybe hit $1,000 by Friday......

If you think I am exaggerating, stop thinking small..... GME had this same trajectory (if you have been following AMC and GME you can see that they have the same exact spikes and dips % wise..... it is on record by the HF that if RH and other apps would have not stopped the sells of GME it could have reached the $1K and over....

On Monday the price will have a big spike with in the first minutes, I would say jumps to $18 and goes to $21 (don’t quote me on this) then it will drop to $15 (why? Cus HF will stop buying.... when selling>buy the prize drops... if the buys are almost at 0% then the big dip happens and all of the paper hands will fold because they see their “profits” drop by 50%.... then the split ordering begins where we have small spikes and dips...... what everyone needs to to is hold and if you can buy some more. When the big drop happens and people still don’t sell then expect it to stay low for that day, all day with more dips then highs but hold.... on the second day if everyone holds is when the HF need (not an option) to cover their shares so the frenzy begins.... 

Here is my prediction for Tuesday..... it begins with a drop, very considerable, if Monday closed at $11, I wouldn’t be surprised if it drops to $7.... the media will drive the word of AMC plummets after Monday spikes leaving hundreds of people paying the price, many small investors loosing their savings (what we all know is that you don’t loose money if you don’t sell at a loss)..... Do not sell (AMC, if nothing happens will be at around $25 when they open)... by 11:00 am EST we will see it go up from $7 to $9, then $12, then $30 (don’t sell at this price), then it might close at $80.... on Wednesday, they HF see that thousands of calls are now ITM and are closing on Friday..... on Wednesday is the big spike, there is a possibility that it can have a high of $300 closing at low $200.... Thursday, if everyone is still holding, it can hit a high of $500 and maybe hit $1,000 by Friday......

If you think I am exaggerating, stop thinking small.....

I wrote something :

**UNDERSTANDING DELTA HEDGING, GAMMA SQUEEZES, EXPIRATION

TL;DR gamma squeezes happen before expiration not after because dealers are dynamically hedging their exposure the whole time

Ex: a dealer sold an $8 AMC 2/26 call on 2/22 when the stock was at $5.50. This short call makes them “short” AMC risk. They don’t want to be short AMC risk they want to be delta neutral. They use option models which calculate the probability the call will be in the money which is called the delta.

When the stock is at $5.50 the chance of an $8 call being ITM in 3 days is... 30% let’s say (much lower for a normal stock but AMC vol is obviously sky high). The chance of an $8 put being ITM is let’s say... 70%. As the stock moves higher both call and put sellers are buying stock (call sellers are INCREASING their hedge. Put seller are DECREASING their hedge)

On 2/22 the call delta was 30% so they bought 30% of their AMC exposure and were delta neutral. As the stock moves up and down the delta changes (the rate of change is gamma). Stock moves to $6 they buy more. Stock goes down to $5 they sell more.

Tuesday/ early Wed stock was drifting higher and $8 call sellers are buying more stock. With the stock at $7 the call delta goes to 48% and the put delta goes to 52% as an example.

*Wed 24th a bunch of call option buyers came in bidding up higher strikes. This forced dealers to buy more stock to hedge. This causes the price to rise. Now as the price of the stock rises, so does the delta (the rate of this change is the gamma). So now the dealers have to buy MORE stock. The closer to expiry the more gamma there is in at the money (ATM) options. So dealers are buying more and more stock which is making the price go up (obviously) which means the call delta goes up which makes them buy more stock. Tada! A gamma squeeze.

The WHOLE time they are hedging. Obviously some of them probably couldn’t hedge fast enough and lost a sht ton of money but generally speaking, they are long the same amount of equity exposure as they are short through options. When the stock was at $11 sellers of $8 calls has hedged 90% + of their exposure. OTOH sellers of $8 puts have now taken their hedge down to 10%.

“Gamma squeezes” work both ways. As the stock starts to drop, those dealers are selling their stock because the probability of an $8 call being exercised is dropping while the probability of an $8 put being exercised is increasing again.

Here comes Friday/ expiry and the stock is right around $8. Lots and lots of contracts are being closed out for profits/ losses and dealers are unwinding hedges.

REMINDER- MOST OPTION CONTRACTS ARE NOT EXERCISED.

Dealers short open calls all the way up to $8 are almost 100% hedged. The probability the calls they are short will be ITM is almost 100%. Dealers short calls from let’s say.... $9 and up are almost 0% hedged (in a normal situation this would be actually 0. For AMC it was non zero) A LOT of this is being unwound on Friday. Lots of positions are getting closed out and dealers are buying/ selling/ shorting stock to stay neutral.

The problem for the dealer short the open $8 call is that as the stock pinballs back and forth from $7.75- $8.25 the probability of the call being ITM is going from 100% to 0% to 100% to 0%. (Gamma is huge here. It’s the rate of change of the delta. It’s changing a lot!)

Right around $8 it’s a huge question mark whether remaining open call options will be exercised or not (reflected in the delta being right around 50% - it’s a 50/50 chance). The dealer doesn’t know if it should be 100% hedged or 0% hedged! Probabilistically they should be 50% hedged. (Hence 50% delta) But if the stock gaps down at 3:59:58 the call seller is over hedged and if it spikes at 3:59:58 they are under hedged. So heading into the close they are selling every time the stock goes below $8 and buying every time it goes above $8. Yes, they are buying high and selling low. They sold options thus are short vol/ short gamma.

On the other hand if dealers are LONG calls or puts they are doing the opposite. A dealer long a $8 call wants to be short 100% of their exposure at $8.02 and 0% at $7.98. So they are long vol, and buying low and selling high.

** So. The reason you’ll see a spike in volume if there is large OI in ATM options is due to a) people closing out their contracts at gains/ losses b) lots and lots of dealer / vol fund hedging in both directions. There is an all out battle between call and put buyers and sellers heading into expiry.

Generally if dealers are net short vol you’ll see the stock drift away from the strike on high volume. If they’re net long vol you’ll see the stock stay pinned near the strike price. (but delta hedging isn’t the only thing happening in the market! This is all happening in the middle of regular buying and selling!)

My guess is the big EOD purchase that drove the stock to $8.01 was dealers capitulating. So now buyers of AMC calls that want to exercise say “hi, I want my 100 shares of AMC stock” and the dealer says “great! I have them right here because I already hedged by buying the stock”.

They do not need to go out and buy millions of shares on Monday. They have already done that

Max pain theory- the theory that the stock will settle at a price that causes the “maximum pain” to option holders, ie where the most dollars at risk end up out of the money. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp This was actually $7 Fri so it didn’t totally apply Swaggy Stocks (Don’t get cute and try to trade off this, you’ll end up losing money.) BUT there was a lot of OI in $8 so while not quite “Max pain,” the stock ending the day above $8 did cause “pain” to some remaining $8 put holders. That “pain” is people who WANTED TO SELL at $8. Some of them may STILL WANT TO SELL on Monday. Or not!

PIN RISK: The pin risk “problem” revolves around expiry. If the stock closes at $7.95 someone will likely want to exercise their put and sell their stock at $8 (5c above market). If the stock closes at $8.05 someone will likely not want to exercise their put and sell their stock at $8 (.05 below market). Sellers of options that are ATM on expiry face some uncertainty that is almost impossible to hedge. If the stock is bouncing around $7.95 or $8.05 or $7.99 it becomes extremely difficult to predict if the option will be exercised. Most brokers “auto-exercise” any option that is ITM by .01. BUT option holders have until 5:30 PM on Friday to instruct their brokers. They can call their brokers and instruct “DNE”- do not exercise. This often happens if the stock moves after hours.

More likely a bunch of idiots bought $8 calls and don’t have the cash to take delivery so the options aren’t exercised.

*IE, you own a $8 AMC put. Stock closes at $7.98 on Friday and you’re in the money. At 4:05 it’s announced that AMZN is buying AMC at $12 a share. You call your broker and scream “do not exercise!!”

*You own an $8 AMC call. Stock closes at $8.01 and you’re in the money. At 4:05 it’s announced that AMC is going bankrupt. You call your broker and scream “do not exercise!!”

Some brokers charge a fee to exercise which further muddies the waters. But the real risk which is difficult to hedge is that option holders have until 5:30 to instruct brokers and a lot can happen from 4:00 to 5:30. On SATURDAY the OCC auto exercises all options that are valid and have not gotten a DNE and randomly assigns the contracts to its members (brokers). In turn, brokers randomly assign the contracts among all the option sellers.

So there IS usually some overhang on Monday in both directions. But it’s really very small. And don’t say “bUt wHaT aBoUt nAkEd cALl sELlErS??” This is a tiny tiny tiny fraction of the market and almost everyone would have just closed out their positions even if at a massive loss.

TL; DR gamma squeezes are real but they happen before expiration not after.",Verb0182,24,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lutnhr/amc_gamma_squeeze/gp96mol/,0.054,0.915,0.031,-0.9907

On the other hand if dealers are LONG calls or puts they are doing the opposite. A dealer long a $8 call wants to be short 100% of their exposure at $8.02 and 0% at $7.98. So they are long vol, and buying low and selling high.

** So. The reason you’ll see a spike in volume if there is large OI in ATM options is due to a) people closing out their contracts at gains/ losses b) lots and lots of dealer / vol fund hedging in both directions. There is an all out battle between call and put buyers and sellers heading into expiry.

Generally if dealers are net short vol you’ll see the stock drift away from the strike on high volume. If they’re net long vol you’ll see the stock stay pinned near the strike price. (but delta hedging isn’t the only thing happening in the market! This is all happening in the middle of regular buying and selling!)

My guess is the big EOD purchase that drove the stock to $8.01 was dealers capitulating. So now buyers of AMC calls that want to exercise say “hi, I want my 100 shares of AMC stock” and the dealer says “great! I have them right here because I already hedged by buying the stock”.

They do not need to go out and buy millions of shares on Monday. They have already done that

Max pain theory- the theory that the stock will settle at a price that causes the “maximum pain” to option holders, ie where the most dollars at risk end up out of the money. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp This was actually $7 Fri so it didn’t totally apply Swaggy Stocks (Don’t get cute and try to trade off this, you’ll end up losing money.) BUT there was a lot of OI in $8 so while not quite “Max pain,” the stock ending the day above $8 did cause “pain” to some remaining $8 put holders. That “pain” is people who WANTED TO SELL at $8. Some of them may STILL WANT TO SELL on Monday. Or not!

PIN RISK: The pin risk “problem” revolves around expiry. If the stock closes at $7.95 someone will likely want to exercise their put and sell their stock at $8 (5c above market). If the stock closes at $8.05 someone will likely not want to exercise their put and sell their stock at $8 (.05 below market). Sellers of options that are ATM on expiry face some uncertainty that is almost impossible to hedge. If the stock is bouncing around $7.95 or $8.05 or $7.99 it becomes extremely difficult to predict if the option will be exercised. Most brokers “auto-exercise” any option that is ITM by .01. BUT option holders have until 5:30 PM on Friday to instruct their brokers. They can call their brokers and instruct “DNE”- do not exercise. This often happens if the stock moves after hours.

More likely a bunch of idiots bought $8 calls and don’t have the cash to take delivery so the options aren’t exercised.

*IE, you own a $8 AMC put. Stock closes at $7.98 on Friday and you’re in the money. At 4:05 it’s announced that AMZN is buying AMC at $12 a share. You call your broker and scream “do not exercise!!”

*You own an $8 AMC call. Stock closes at $8.01 and you’re in the money. At 4:05 it’s announced that AMC is going bankrupt. You call your broker and scream “do not exercise!!”

Some brokers charge a fee to exercise which further muddies the waters. But the real risk which is difficult to hedge is that option holders have until 5:30 to instruct brokers and a lot can happen from 4:00 to 5:30. On SATURDAY the OCC auto exercises all options that are valid and have not gotten a DNE and randomly assigns the contracts to its members (brokers). In turn, brokers randomly assign the contracts among all the option sellers.

So there IS usually some overhang on Monday in both directions. But it’s really very small. And don’t say “bUt wHaT aBoUt nAkEd cALl sELlErS??” This is a tiny tiny tiny fraction of the market and almost everyone would have just closed out their positions even if at a massive loss.

**UNDERSTANDING DELTA HEDGING, GAMMA SQUEEZES, EXPIRATION

TL;DR gamma squeezes happen before expiration not after because dealers are dynamically hedging their exposure the whole time

Ex: a dealer sold an $8 AMC 2/26 call on 2/22 when the stock was at $5.50. This short call makes them “short” AMC risk. They don’t want to be short AMC risk they want to be delta neutral. They use option models which calculate the probability the call will be in the money which is called the delta.

When the stock is at $5.50 the chance of an $8 call being ITM in 3 days is... 30% let’s say (much lower for a normal stock but AMC vol is obviously sky high). The chance of an $8 put being ITM is let’s say... 70%. As the stock moves higher both call and put sellers are buying stock (call sellers are INCREASING their hedge. Put seller are DECREASING their hedge)

On 2/22 the call delta was 30% so they bought 30% of their AMC exposure and were delta neutral. As the stock moves up and down the delta changes (the rate of change is gamma). Stock moves to $6 they buy more. Stock goes down to $5 they sell more.

Tuesday/ early Wed stock was drifting higher and $8 call sellers are buying more stock. With the stock at $7 the call delta goes to 48% and the put delta goes to 52% as an example.

*Wed 24th a bunch of call option buyers came in bidding up higher strikes. This forced dealers to buy more stock to hedge. This causes the price to rise. Now as the price of the stock rises, so does the delta (the rate of this change is the gamma). So now the dealers have to buy MORE stock. The closer to expiry the more gamma there is in at the money (ATM) options. So dealers are buying more and more stock which is making the price go up (obviously) which means the call delta goes up which makes them buy more stock. Tada! A gamma squeeze.

The WHOLE time they are hedging. Obviously some of them probably couldn’t hedge fast enough and lost a sht ton of money but generally speaking, they are long the same amount of equity exposure as they are short through options. When the stock was at $11 sellers of $8 calls has hedged 90% + of their exposure. OTOH sellers of $8 puts have now taken their hedge down to 10%.

“Gamma squeezes” work both ways. As the stock starts to drop, those dealers are selling their stock because the probability of an $8 call being exercised is dropping while the probability of an $8 put being exercised is increasing again.

Here comes Friday/ expiry and the stock is right around $8. Lots and lots of contracts are being closed out for profits/ losses and dealers are unwinding hedges.

REMINDER- MOST OPTION CONTRACTS ARE NOT EXERCISED.

Dealers short open calls all the way up to $8 are almost 100% hedged. The probability the calls they are short will be ITM is almost 100%. Dealers short calls from let’s say.... $9 and up are almost 0% hedged (in a normal situation this would be actually 0. For AMC it was non zero) A LOT of this is being unwound on Friday. Lots of positions are getting closed out and dealers are buying/ selling/ shorting stock to stay neutral.

The problem for the dealer short the open $8 call is that as the stock pinballs back and forth from $7.75- $8.25 the probability of the call being ITM is going from 100% to 0% to 100% to 0%. (Gamma is huge here. It’s the rate of change of the delta. It’s changing a lot!)

Right around $8 it’s a huge question mark whether remaining open call options will be exercised or not (reflected in the delta being right around 50% - it’s a 50/50 chance). The dealer doesn’t know if it should be 100% hedged or 0% hedged! Probabilistically they should be 50% hedged. (Hence 50% delta) But if the stock gaps down at 3:59:58 the call seller is over hedged and if it spikes at 3:59:58 they are under hedged. So heading into the close they are selling every time the stock goes below $8 and buying every time it goes above $8. Yes, they are buying high and selling low. They sold options thus are short vol/ short gamma.

On the other hand if dealers are LONG calls or puts they are doing the opposite. A dealer long a $8 call wants to be short 100% of their exposure at $8.02 and 0% at $7.98. So they are long vol, and buying low and selling high.

So dealers are buying more and more stock which is making the price go up (obviously) which means the call delta goes up which makes them buy more stock. Tada! A gamma squeeze.

The WHOLE time they are hedging. Obviously some of them probably couldn’t hedge fast enough and lost a sht ton of money but generally speaking, they are long the same amount of equity exposure as they are short through options. When the stock was at $11 sellers of $8 calls has hedged 90% + of their exposure. OTOH sellers of $8 puts have now taken their hedge down to 10%.

“Gamma squeezes” work both ways. As the stock starts to drop, those dealers are selling their stock because the probability of an $8 call being exercised is dropping while the probability of an $8 put being exercised is increasing again.

Here comes Friday/ expiry and the stock is right around $8. Lots and lots of contracts are being closed out for profits/ losses and dealers are unwinding hedges.

REMINDER- MOST OPTION CONTRACTS ARE NOT EXERCISED.

Dealers short open calls all the way up to $8 are almost 100% hedged. The probability the calls they are short will be ITM is almost 100%. Dealers short calls from let’s say.... $9 and up are almost 0% hedged (in a normal situation this would be actually 0. For AMC it was non zero) A LOT of this is being unwound on Friday. Lots of positions are getting closed out and dealers are buying/ selling/ shorting stock to stay neutral.

The problem for the dealer short the open $8 call is that as the stock pinballs back and forth from $7.75- $8.25 the probability of the call being ITM is going from 100% to 0% to 100% to 0%. (Gamma is huge here. It’s the rate of change of the delta. It’s changing a lot!)

Right around $8 it’s a huge question mark whether remaining open call options will be exercised or not (reflected in the delta being right around 50% - it’s a 50/50 chance). The dealer doesn’t know if it should be 100% hedged or 0% hedged! Probabilistically they should be 50% hedged. (Hence 50% delta) But if the stock gaps down at 3:59:58 the call seller is over hedged and if it spikes at 3:59:58 they are under hedged. So heading into the close they are selling every time the stock goes below $8 and buying every time it goes above $8. Yes, they are buying high and selling low. They sold options thus are short vol/ short gamma.

On the other hand if dealers are LONG calls or puts they are doing the opposite. A dealer long a $8 call wants to be short 100% of their exposure at $8.02 and 0% at $7.98. So they are long vol, and buying low and selling high.

** So. The reason you’ll see a spike in volume if there is large OI in ATM options is due to a) people closing out their contracts at gains/ losses b) lots and lots of dealer / vol fund hedging in both directions. There is an all out battle between call and put buyers and sellers heading into expiry.

Generally if dealers are net short vol you’ll see the stock drift away from the strike on high volume. If they’re net long vol you’ll see the stock stay pinned near the strike price. (but delta hedging isn’t the only thing happening in the market! This is all happening in the middle of regular buying and selling!)

My guess is the big EOD purchase that drove the stock to $8.01 was dealers capitulating. So now buyers of AMC calls that want to exercise say “hi, I want my 100 shares of AMC stock” and the dealer says “great! I have them right here because I already hedged by buying the stock”.

They do not need to go out and buy millions of shares on Monday. They have already done that

Max pain theory- the theory that the stock will settle at a price that causes the “maximum pain” to option holders, ie where the most dollars at risk end up out of the money. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp This was actually $7 Fri so it didn’t totally apply Swaggy Stocks (Don’t get cute and try to trade off this, you’ll end up losing money.) BUT there was a lot of OI in $8 so while not quite “Max pain,” the stock ending the day above $8 did cause “pain” to some remaining $8 put holders. That “pain” is people who WANTED TO SELL at $8. Some of them may STILL WANT TO SELL on Monday. Or not!

PIN RISK: The pin risk “problem” revolves around expiry. If the stock closes at $7.95 someone will likely want to exercise their put and sell their stock at $8 (5c above market). If the stock closes at $8.05 someone will likely not want to exercise their put and sell their stock at $8 (.05 below market). Sellers of options that are ATM on expiry face some uncertainty that is almost impossible to hedge. If the stock is bouncing around $7.95 or $8.05 or $7.99 it becomes extremely difficult to predict if the option will be exercised. Most brokers “auto-exercise” any option that is ITM by .01. BUT option holders have until 5:30 PM on Friday to instruct their brokers. They can call their brokers and instruct “DNE”- do not exercise. This often happens if the stock moves after hours.

More likely a bunch of idiots bought $8 calls and don’t have the cash to take delivery so the options aren’t exercised.

*IE, you own a $8 AMC put. Stock closes at $7.98 on Friday and you’re in the money. At 4:05 it’s announced that AMZN is buying AMC at $12 a share. You call your broker and scream “do not exercise!!”

*You own an $8 AMC call. Stock closes at $8.01 and you’re in the money. At 4:05 it’s announced that AMC is going bankrupt. You call your broker and scream “do not exercise!!”

Some brokers charge a fee to exercise which further muddies the waters. But the real risk which is difficult to hedge is that option holders have until 5:30 to instruct brokers and a lot can happen from 4:00 to 5:30. On SATURDAY the OCC auto exercises all options that are valid and have not gotten a DNE and randomly assigns the contracts to its members (brokers). In turn, brokers randomly assign the contracts among all the option sellers.

So there IS usually some overhang on Monday in both directions. But it’s really very small. And don’t say “bUt wHaT aBoUt nAkEd cALl sELlErS??” This is a tiny tiny tiny fraction of the market and almost everyone would have just closed out their positions even if at a massive loss.

1909,PM," Because that’s how it works. For your reading pleasure: 

I wrote something :

**UNDERSTANDING DELTA HEDGING, GAMMA SQUEEZES, EXPIRATION

TL;DR gamma squeezes happen before expiration not after because dealers are dynamically hedging their exposure the whole time

Ex: a dealer sold an $8 AMC 2/26 call on 2/22 when the stock was at $5.50. This short call makes them “short” AMC risk. They don’t want to be short AMC risk they want to be delta neutral. They use option models which calculate the probability the call will be in the money which is called the delta.

When the stock is at $5.50 the chance of an $8 call being ITM in 3 days is... 30% let’s say (much lower for a normal stock but AMC vol is obviously sky high). The chance of an $8 put being ITM is let’s say... 70%. As the stock moves higher both call and put sellers are buying stock (call sellers are INCREASING their hedge. Put seller are DECREASING their hedge)

On 2/22 the call delta was 30% so they bought 30% of their AMC exposure and were delta neutral. As the stock moves up and down the delta changes (the rate of change is gamma). Stock moves to $6 they buy more. Stock goes down to $5 they sell more.

Tuesday/ early Wed stock was drifting higher and $8 call sellers are buying more stock. With the stock at $7 the call delta goes to 48% and the put delta goes to 52% as an example.

*Wed 24th a bunch of call option buyers came in bidding up higher strikes. This forced dealers to buy more stock to hedge. This causes the price to rise. Now as the price of the stock rises, so does the delta (the rate of this change is the gamma). So now the dealers have to buy MORE stock. The closer to expiry the more gamma there is in at the money (ATM) options. So dealers are buying more and more stock which is making the price go up (obviously) which means the call delta goes up which makes them buy more stock. Tada! A gamma squeeze.

If this is indeed the case, **wouldn't it be in the HF's interest for the 'squeeze to be squoze'?**

If they can keep shorting GME and drive the price down and buy naked ITM calls from the Chicago MM's, wouldn't that just be the HF's giving the bag to the Chicago MM's and throwing them under the bus?

That way the HF's can ''cover'' their shorts and possibly go long on GME with as much naked ITM calls as they can buy and pass their obligation to find and buy all these shares to the Chicago MM's, which the HF's knows will make the stock skyrocket.

They’re not “handing over the bag”, they’re still responsible for paying interest on any shares they have not returned! Similarly, if shares are called back, THE HEDGE FUNDS are still responsible. If the options writers don’t give shares to hedge funds, yes, they are in trouble. But that doesn’t mean that if hedge funds don’t return shares to brokers, they can magically remove themselves from the chain and say “oh go get the shares from the options writers”. That’s not how debt works.

That said, if you’ve ever seen me before, you know I’m as big a GME bull as any, and I still think we’re mooning.

2022,GME," This is retarded. 

Hedge funds don't need to sell short directly to profit off the downward trend in the stock price, nor do they need to write calls. They're not cavemen; they know options trading strategies and can buy puts too. There are a lot of puts open on GME, by the way. For 26 February expiry, the open interest on GME was 167,674 puts and 146,985 calls, and this ratio only gets worse for later dates.

Market makers stay delta neutral on both puts and calls, which may contribute to some of the short selling, but the important point to make is that they don't normally lose a lot of money on this - it's supposed to be arbitrage, not speculation, so you're not really going to squeeze them easily.

Even if hedge funds are naked short on calls at one strike price, they might be long at another strike price to offset the risk, and they can cover their loss positions even if you're diamond hands and held your calls to the bitter end and exercised them.

It's like ""The Big Long"".

TBH, there were lots of words I didn't understand while eating my crayons. Something to do with making ITM calls with that expire on the day... waiting for Chicago options traders... then buying twice as much stock ITM to cover the loss AND own stock simultaneously...

Something I don't understand (because me not think good) is, other people mentioning naked shorts in the same breath as 'creating counterfeit shorts' and how does that gel with the number of shares they'll have to find in the market?

If they've created more than 100% of the float, how can that work? Or do they just need to go from say 140% of the float -> 99.9% to take the pressure off?

I was getting the impression that the shorts would basically have to buy every single outstanding share, resulting in them becoming owners of the company (Or more likely that the GME owners would set a price, have the shorts pay off all the existing shareholders at a high price then issue a bunch more shares to get them off the hook).

2297,MSM," ""cheap luxury"" => A one-time ticket for the price of a one-month unlimited streaming 🙈    

In 2008 you didn't have Disney+, Netflix (yes I know, but you get the idea), Hulu, HBO max ....  
In 2009 people didn't stop going to the movies, true, but in 2009 Disney didn't ditch the theaters for their platform.
Sure, it's only a few movies here and there so far (according to their public 2021 release schedule), however they started doing it, and they don't have any reason to stop for now.  
The real question on the table is: Given a popular title, would it bring more money to Disney to release it in theatres (~cost of 1 ticket minus the theater's share), or to bring new customers to their platform (~monthly subscription not to miss the next releases).  
In order to answer this question, they will have to release a popular franchise on their platform only, and see how it goes (at the price of a bad buzz in the MSM but who cares...), they could make you pay a premium to watch newly releases titles in the first few weeks, for a fraction of a cinema's ticket, becoming their own movie theater.  
On top of that people got used to watching movies at home, and slowly they realize they don't need to pay 15 bucks to watch a movie surrounded by noisy people and being offered overpriced crap food.  
Not to mention VR movie theater like BigScreen which have the potential to be a game changer in the long run.  


IMHO there's a lot going on, and it's too early to say the theatres have survived the pandemic.",kerian22,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lv4wuw/heres_why_i_think_amc_is_solid_long_bet/gpa9li6/,0.046,0.849,0.105,0.9508

2301,TV," Counter point: I see them as fundamentally different markets. They are not mutually exclusive. Disney fought like hell against VHS because they saw it as a threat to ticket sales, then they realized that people would not only go see the film, but then they'd buy it too! Then they realized they could pre-release the films to rental businesses, and people would still buy tickets and the VHS, but they'd also rent it in between. Then they added pay per view and HBO et al, and still people bought tickets. Ticket sales never suffered because again, it's a cheap luxury. I mean, shit, anyone can get any movie for free on the internet, and still people but tickets and pay for streaming services.

Streaming movies is not a luxury in any way, it's just another night in the couch. Going to a restaurant (even Panera or Shake Shack) is 10x more than cooking at home, but it's nice, it's an experience different than just another night at home, and given the cost, I'd also consider it a cheap luxury.

VR is just another way to stream at home and I therefore don't see it as disruptive to theaters. I have vr and I'd still rather watch on my TV. 

It sounds like you've had bad theater experiences, and that sucks. Being surrounded by noisy people and eating over priced, shitty food isn't everyone's cup of tea, but I'd still choose in the stadium over watching on TV, at the concert over on the radio, and in the theater over at home. Not for every film, and not even every month, but when the right one comes along, I'll pay for it more than once.",The--scientist,10,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lv4wuw/heres_why_i_think_amc_is_solid_long_bet/gpab0pk/,0.122,0.825,0.053,-0.953

2303,ANY," Oh, and I forgot to mention, the whole ""we don't know if being vaccinated keeps you from transmitting the virus"" thing is bullshit, the same way ""don't bother with masks"" was bullshit. And I'm not just saying this with the benefit of hindsight, I was ringing this bell over a year ago, posting published studies which showed that wearing masks protected the person wearing it and the people around them. I bought reusable n95 masks for my family after a work trip to India and China in December of 2019 because of all the chatter. They were telling people not to wear masks so they wouldn't disrupt the supply chain, which was already overburdened and they ended up doing a shit ton of damage as we've fought to convince people to wear masks now that we have them.

In this case, they're telling people, in a similarly irresponsible way that we don't know if vaccinated people can still transmit it, not because we have ANY reason to believe they can, but because they're afraid vaccinated people will change their behavior (stop wearing masks, stop social distancing) which will make unvaccinated people feel less pressure to follow those rules. I'm not aware of any instances of any disease where you can be vaccinated and still be a vector. If you're immune system responds and destroys the virus, you're not able to be a vector. I may be wrong, but I haven't been able to find anything in the literature. And I know the bot is going to be mad at me about this, but look, I've just gone another 10 minutes without checking the ticker.

Edit: why would this hey down voted? It's true...
