2,NIO," certainly not the opportunity of a lifetime. heres a few examples from recent years of when we were told ""chance of a lifetime!"" and it wasnt..

4,RH, Is anybody buying in on the warrants? Doesnâ€™t look like theyâ€™re available on RH unless thereâ€™s a trick to finding them. They closed at $.44 on Friday.,Environmental_Toe463,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/np8h55/opportunity_of_a_lifetime_dds_for_goed_goedekers/h0496bt/,0.043,0.866,0.09,0.3182
5,RS," Past price would be backward adjusted for the RS (in fact would have been 46 cents at the time, but adjusted price is much more relevant.) However, the stock has been diluted 16x over the last year. In other words, the market cap is actually higher now than it was a year ago, even though stock has lost 90%. In that sense OP, you can't assume the stock is a better value simply because the shares are cheaper. Fundamentals and value aren't the be all and end all, but something to keep in mind if that is the premise.",stompingllama,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/np3q03/finally_found_robinhoodpennystocks/h044vlo/,0.027,0.853,0.119,0.872
