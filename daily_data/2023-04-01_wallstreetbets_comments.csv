55,NVDA," I have been burned by it but much smaller positions and closer expiry. The all time high was 330 in Nov 2021, it's around 18% away from that right now. So rally probably has some room to go (and your loss will likely increase) in the short term.

But the stock is definetly overpriced, and there is a lot of macro economic events coming in the summer that could jolt the market and NVDA might retrace atleast to August 2022 rally levels of 190. Also note that NVDA slide last year started in April and this year too there is some negative news coming from China (Micron). 

In 2022, Nvidia made almost 60% of its revenue from China and Taiwan. That's a big risk given that Biden administration is turning on the heat on China in terms of semiconductor leadership and in turn China wanting to support Chinese semiconductor companies (example Moore Threads).",Silly_Escape13,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12839rs/tired_and_more_scared_after_todays_rally_hold_or/jehpe3o/,0.066,0.911,0.022,-0.7964

I bought NVDA at 137 and have protective puts at 250 to June just to help protect some gains in short term.  Long term this is a cash machine, but we can get overbought and pull back some especially if interest rates surprise on the upside or the FED.

Just to note I originally bought 5 puts at 23 a share at 265 and every 10 dollars up on NVDA adding an additional 5 puts to the total to lower my put basis. If we have a small dip I can roll them out or take risk off.
