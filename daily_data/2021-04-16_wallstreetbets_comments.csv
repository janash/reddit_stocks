Some of the options strategies may be difficult for people but that just comes with the territory. It is correct information. So they are trying to educate people on how things work in easy to understand formats. Classroom lectures in college (which I’m in now) can and are way more difficult to understand compared to the Robinhood learn. I personally support them teaching the commoners to become “sophisticated” as per the definition. 

In regards to the way they handle securities, I do not work for them so I have no idea how they handle them. I can hope they handle everything legally.

Especially the deferred cash settlements and targeted promotions/ads for inexperienced investors. I use RH for fun, but I am a relatively experienced investor and I never got any of the promotions that others did, which enticed customers to deposit large(r) sums of money for cash rewards around the same time stimulus checks were cut. It is pretty disturbing. The worst, I think, is that there is zero customer service. Issues and inquiries have to be communicated through a message written on the app and sent to ?????? —and “resolutions” are largely automated and arrive in the customer’s inbox days later.

135,GME," I know the decision to end these threads is disappointing, and this was an abrupt way to do it, but WSB has so much amazing content that's getting buried under GME that we had to do something.

Did you see the billionaire that was balls deep on leverage and lost $20 BILLION in a massive margin call? His liquidation caused a massive crash and major losses to the big banks. 

Did you see the tons of different non-GME YOLOs / DDs that got posted in the last week? Some of those people are probably going to go bankrupt and it would be fun to laugh at them. 

That's kind of cool stuff we want to see more of on WSB. We are WallStreetBETS after all! 

To be honest with you, it's a bit weird seeing people post share YOLOs non-stop. This sub was built on insane options plays (""FDs"") and high risk plays.

If you want to talk GME here, that's cool too, but there's now dedicated subreddits for that, like r/SuperStonk and r/GME. Check them out! You'll find more focused conversation there.

159,TA, I’ve posted/lurked in wsb for about 3 years now (different user names) and I’ve loved hearing about all the ideas and plays and seeing the loss and gain porn. I adore all the degenerates here. I like the positions or ban requirement. Wsb was my intro to options. It told me about the jpow brrrr and the v-shaped recovery last year. I learned that TA is the best way to sound smart but be actually retarded. Wsb showed me that dividends and boomer stocks was for nerds. And it taught me how to lose money really fast and that I should always inverse myself. But in The last 3 months I’ve literally learned 5x what I knew from the past 3 years. Gme is the most interesting story of the year. This megathread was going to eventually and naturally be replaced as apes learn new plays and the gme story unfolds. It doesn’t make sense to make an executive unilateral decision to kill the thread and it just makes mods look sus af. Killing the thread only feeds the conspiracy/cultish mindset. Just like all the CNBC/motley fool/S3/etc... FUD proved to me that gme was a real threat.

251,GO," DFV’s Walter Mitty tweet?

I’ve never seen the movie, so I went to Wikipedia (where else) to get sum straight factz. What I found in the plot synopsis was, well, shocking!:

“Walter Mitty is a negative assets manager at Life magazine who daydreams of adventures... Mitty works with legendary photojournalist Sean O'Connell, although they have never met in person. O'Connell has sent Mitty his latest negatives... The negative is missing, forcing Walter to stall for time with corporate transition manager Ted Hendricks, who is handling the downsizing.”

Negatives assets going missing, and stalling for time until they can be retrieved? Sounds a lot like FTDs and naked shorts right?

There’s a ton more in there but it all gets a bit tin-foilly. ‘Negative assets’ really stood out for me, took my smooth brain a while to figure out they were talking about photos but it’s the kind of smart cryptic breadcrumb that DFV would leave for us window lickers.

TL;DR: Walter Mitty manages NEGATIVE ASSETS that GO MISSING and result in a WILD GOOSE CHASE.

And remember, it may not moon today, it may not moon next week, it may not even moon this year, but whilst there is faith, the moon is ultimately inevitable.

They can do a failure to deliver https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_to_deliver which means instead of buying a REAL GME share at $150 causing it to moon, they will instead screw us by paying a tiny FTD fine in the pennies. They can pay the FTD forever. Until the stocks come down to 40, there is zero incentive to ever not pay the FTD. Buying stock and causing the squeeze is the absolute last thing. Now what happens is that a HF decides on FRIDAY to buy a shitload of stock. This price drives up the stock really fast on FRIDAY. Then the value of people's calls also go up, which _could_ have an impact if they execute and then hodl. Point is, it has to be a perfect storm of options in the money, a big money whale buying on Friday, massive volume, and a stock recall for it to squeeze.

329,GME," Dude bought options to buy 100 shares of GME for $5 a piece in May of 2020. Back then the stock was like $4 and not many people thought it would ever recover.

Basically a hedge fund was betting back then that the stock would go down. To protect their investment they sold these OTM (out of money) options as a hedge - if the stock price did go up their short position would suffer. So the premiums they collected from this guy to purchase those options should have protected them against small movements up in price against their short position. 

So he paid $150 a year ago to buy 100 shares at $5 a piece at any point in the future before the contract expired. Those 100 shares at today's prices are worth $15k when he exercises his option. He paid something like $150 for the contract and $500 to buy the stocks which are now valued at $15k. Correct me if I'm wrong on any of this.

Edit: corrected what he paid",ark_mod,39,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ms8wun/100_gme_shares_for_500/gur91u3/,0.036,0.846,0.118,0.9062

338,RH," Not technically.

Options *are* a levered financial instrument with potential for losses greater than 100%, but only for writ calls or puts (writing a call is bearish, as it is the opposite of buying a call). You could get margin called if there is a threat you can't cover your losses, but I personally don't like that kind of risk.

Using leverage in trading is basically trading on margin (you are trading on credit). Leverage allows you to literally use money you don't own to buy a security. Like RH allows you to buy twice the amount of stock on margin. But you can get margin called if your unrealized losses go below the margin maintainance. Forex trading has the largest leverage abilities by far - I am not super knowledgeable here tbh but 100:1 is not uncommon - if you put 1k into a forex account you could trade with 100k - sounds wild but forex trades in such small increments that it's often negligible. Pretty sure forex trades at the 4th decimal point which are called pips. 1 pip is .0001. But yeah I'm not a forex trader lol",Corona-walrus,22,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ms8wun/100_gme_shares_for_500/gurb2oi/,0.126,0.776,0.098,-0.7828
339,GME," Ok, here's the idea behind options.

When you purchase a call, you're essentially ""borrowing"" 100 shares from a Market Maker until you sell the contract or exercise it.  You pay a fee to ""borrow"" those shares of $1.30 per share like OP did, so they spent $130 total to borrow 100 shares.  If Gamestop went bankrupt (like Melvin and Citadel thought they would) by the date the option expires, OP would lose all $130.  If Gamestop moons like it has, he could sell the contract BACK to the market maker (or another person) for a shitton of profit without having to have actually bought the shares way back when.

In this instance, everyone knows GME is going to lift off and go even higher at some point, so the smart thing is to exercise the call for $500 (so in total OP has payed $630 for 100 shares of Gamestop) so that they can sell it in 3 months for $10,000,000 per share.",sjrotella,12,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ms8wun/100_gme_shares_for_500/gurehr5/,0.043,0.798,0.159,0.95
340,GME," Sort-of. So a call is that you expect it to reach that price *or* go higher. When you exercise the contract you agree to buy for the price of strike price you put when you bought the contract.

If I'm reading the screenshot right, it looks like it cost him $150. Since we're used to modern GME risking an additional $150 doesn't sound like much, but that's the basic concept - risk less, gain less (he now has 100 shares for a total cost of $650 when he could have had them for $300 (or something, $3 was a hypothetical), but only $150 was at risk of being lost).",empyreanmax,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ms8wun/100_gme_shares_for_500/gurg0f7/,0.078,0.815,0.107,0.4934

466,FL," **FUCK OFF YOU MSO RETARDS. TAKE YOUR FUNDAMENTALS AND SHOVE THEM UP YOUR ASS. THEY ARE INFLATED JUST LIKE YOUR SELF CONFIDENCE**

""MSOs"" are NOT special. Stop pretending like they are better because of their fundamentals, you boomers. No one gives a shit. Quantitative analysis has very little value in the cannabis sector. Qualitative analysis is much more important. Quantitative analysis is **backwards** looking at previous performance. Qualitative is looking at the future. The future of cannabis looks **very** different than the past does.

Looking at the unique qualities of LP vs MSOs, there is a clear winner. Most major MSOs rely on vertical integration and operating within restrictive environments that limit competition. They face very little competition on pricing and quality in most States they operate in. You can tell they are clinging on to this **dying** business model by looking at Trulieve spending 60m on 3 retail locations. New York's tiered system is a clear signal to where the US legal market is headed, considering the man in the foreground for the push for marijuana is Chuck Schumer (D - **NY**). 

The future of cannabis success is not in retail or vertical integration. The future leaders of the cannabis industry will be companies who master the ability to produce, process, and distribute cannabis at a large scale and to a national and international market. The only retail stores that will be any different than your local corner store will be ""destination dispensaries"" like the Planet ones. 

Canadian LPs have already lived through the horrors of a highly competitive and over stocked legal market. Their products quality, pricing, and branding have all been tested among many many other companies. Aphria's Broken Coast brand rose above every single other cannabis brand in Canada's over populated market and won the KIND awards for ""Best Craft Cannabis Brand."" That says something, especially since it was voted on by *budtenders..* They are also already operating under and production and distribution business model. They stand ready, right now, to distribute their brands into stores in the US and take market share away from US companies. Basically **any** new company making a $1 in a market like FL is directly taking that dollar from the 5 companies that currently operate there and control +80% of the market.",OverwatchNWeed,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ms6yh8/senate_majority_leader_chuck_schumer_stated_on/gurdvi5/,0.048,0.81,0.141,0.9876

Now he goes on TV and shits on FB for the culture of the company which he was absolutely one of the key architects of.

If they do that, or show signs of being willing to do that, I am out immediately.  Record stores did that with iTunes.  Do not fight the Internet.  They do media distribution better than any professional organizations, even when doing it for free as a side hobby.  It's not a valuable service.  The value of theaters is NOT in making films available to the public.  Their value lies in other aspects of their business (the giant sound systems, huge screens, opportunity for teenagers to escape their parents, providing a social experience, and more) and they will coexist just fine.

Cycle of life exists even in business. At least with HboMax I can enjoy my 60 cent can of coke. Imagine 50 million people watching at home, paying a monthly fee that equates to 1 ticket price, drinking a 60 cent coke,vs a 12.00 coke. Thats $570m that people are spending somewhere else.

From a stock point, make it while you can. From a consumer point, burn. And when the cycle starts over and streaming is 50.00 a month or up, technology will deliver the next cycle of life balancer I'm sure.

Of course you did. It was a sales pitch specifically targeted at ripping off retail investors. A flat price when the shares have been diluted 400% is an inflated price. People going back to the movies is something that everyone knows about, it was already priced in before AMC started dumping shares.

These guys weren't making money when film revenues were hitting the stratosphere before COVID, they aren't going to suddenly start making money now.

Overall their business model has not changed. And just becuase YOU want to go to movies, doesn't mean every previous movie-goer will continue going as streaming from home is more popular by the day. 

Maybe if their balance sheet was total garbage they wouldn't have needed to dilute shares herendously to re-do theaters. Ooof imagine actually have cash in hand, who would have thought. But for AMC it was their only option due to crippling debt.

It could return to those levels with super strong revenue growth but I wouldn’t be betting on a quick return to 100x sales when the market has lost its appetite for these kinds of stocks with bond yields on the rise.,Spectacle_Maker,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mrpky1/plug_is_incredibly_oversold_and_way_under_current/guo7ruf/,0.032,0.884,0.084,0.4118

615,PLUG," Big 4 Auditor here. From what I've read PLUG massively fucked up in the following ways:

\- Overstated Assets

\- Failed to include losses from contracts on their financials

\- Misclassified certain costs so it would decrease R&D expense, thus boosting their revenue and profitability ratios

\- Understated impairment expense, thus boosting their revenue and profitability ratios

In my experience, when it rains it pours. Issues like these tend to be the tip of the iceberg and 99.99% of the time are driven by the executives of the company. Additionally, if you are having to fraudulently misclassify items in your Balance Sheet and Income Statement so your company's performance looks better, there are probably deeper issues going on.

12.5c for me. It'll go I think, I'm really not worried.

Infrastructure bill has like 200mil of charging stations IIRC. RIDE is projecting cost of ownership to be waaaay better than traditional trucks. It's a great fit for corporate fleets. Housings supply is short 3.4mil units nationally, so builder profits will go up.

As a risk/reward play, I think this one is a great ratio.

705,IMO," Thank you for sharing. As a robot surgeon myself, maybe I can give back some love by giving my opinion on the matter.

First of all, it is surprising how much of this info is quite accurate so you 've certainly done a good job about that, which gives you more credibility IMO. Maybe not the hangover part but still.

Speaking long term, this company is here to stay. The technology they offer is second to none.  The ease of operating, what we can achieve, it really is world changing. Robotic surgery is already well established and will continue to grow as more and more procedures are bound to be performed robot-assisted and not laparoscopically anymore.

They have an excellent business model in which instruments are disposable, big maintenance contracts, and a new model every few years (so they did improve, actually, and continue to do so); support for older models is no longer offered at some point so you have to buy the new one.

They have no competition because they simply buy up any company that is doing anything remotely similar. Some other companies I saw are trying to improve laparoscopy rather than completely reinvent  it, mostly because robotics are quite expensive. They try to take the niche for procedures that are too simple to waste robotic resources on, but still require a lot of laparoscopic skills. However, sorry to offend, but a lot of these alterations look clunky and seem unreliable and unpractical.

The only reason why not everyone is using the robot already, is exactly this, that Intuitive really takes good advantage of its monopoly position, and so it really is expensive to use it.

I believe that at some point in the future, another company eventually will offer a robotic system that is up to the same quality standards. IMO this can only be a company that is big enough to support their own R&D and not be swallowed by Intuitive. For me, Medtronic is the best bet for this (or maybe some Chinese company). This then would lead to a significant drop in costs for robotic surgery (and probably a big drop in stock price for Intuitive); on the other hand, it would make robotic surgery even more mainstream and as Intuitive is already quite on top, they are likely to be able to withstand the competition and remain a top player in the field, and continue to grow from this in the long term.

It is true that corona caused a backlog even in this kind of surgery (it has a lot of oncological applications, but even some of those got postponed), also put a hold on congresses, training programs etc. and a tepmorary drop in revenue is certainly possible.

&#x200B;

TLDR: I share your opinion that the stock will come down from where it is now, but probably only momentarily. I will be hoping with you for a drop in Intuitive stock price, but will use it as an entry point for a long position instead (which in retrospect, I should have done already a long time ago). In the meantime, I am long Medtronic as well. Not very wallstreetbetsy, but I believe these are both good plays long term.",Bosarius,18,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ms51jy/nrdrages_friday_dd_a_robot_may_not_injure_a_human/guqv9vm/,0.046,0.811,0.143,0.9951

Weed isn't like headphones. You can't slap a popular face/name on it and sell billions. You might get some 1 time purchases, but if the quality isn't there then good luck getting a 2nd from anyone. Especially when it's overpriced because of the fancy face/name on or behind the package.

741,IP," I was involved in a marijuana dispensary application and a whole lot of the dispensaries in my state are owned by the Canadian marijuana companies. They ""buy"" the companies through some loan and debt structure. The ""owners"" hold the license but don't have any equity and get paid a management fee. The only way I know this is someone I knew during the license process ""sold"" their license and I met the attorney who does a lot of the contracts and also has marijuana equity for the tobacco industry.

He happens to be the guy that advises on licensing structure and wrote this book. There is definitely great stock opportunities for marijuana companies but it is difficult to figure out who has what since there is all these she'll companies and no IP protection.
