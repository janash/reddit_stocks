51,UK," I have had SNDD since Dr. Drew mentioned it on his podcast more than a year ago. He became involved because of the needle destruction device and his work with heroin and opioid abuse.

Its a diversified holding company set up by a bunch of former oil execs from New Orleans. They also own a hotel in Hawaii, and they buy and sell oil service companies in the Gulf of Mexico depending on the state of that market (it fluctuates wildly depending on the price of oil)  

The company transitioned to manufacturing and dealing PPE during the middle portion of the Covid-19 epidemic, and actually made a lot of money doing so. This slowed the roll out of the SANDD Pro. They released the SANDD Pro in February, with a million orders which lead to the bump in the price.

Not mentioned here is that they are the licensed dealers of over the counter Omeprazole (heartburn medication), ibuprophen, and a diabetes drug in the UK. All growth industries in that country.

Post covid EVERY country in the world (including America) is looking for revenue to make up for HUGE deficits last 12+ months.  Finding oil give Namibia not only $$$ (direct and through jobs) to help their country grow, but gives them regional and international political power with upcoming new found allies they would not have had before.

96,ALL," Sorry are you talking to me or jim-and-pam?

If me...

I look for pennies that have 10x potential.  That means they are trying to do stuff that if they hit makes them blow up, but of course if they miss they blow up in a bad way.  That is a fair tradeoff in risk/ return.  If they hit 10x+ and if they miss possible 100% (1x) loss.  Their success is NOT based on hope they grow organic or hope other investors will pile into the play or a quick flip and hope I can catch a rocket .  Their success or not is just based on their catalyst being met or failing.

Recaf is a perfect example.  Their catalyst is drilling these 3 wells with seismic study to prove commercial oil.  If they can hit it should be 10x over next 2-5 years.  If they miss then near total loss (not as likely now since a total miss just means more wells have to be paid for to keep drilling since we now know there is a petroleum reserve in the basin).  That is how the 6-2 well changed everything.  It solidified a shot at 10x+ and derisked a chance at total loss.

I like plays that have CLEAR catalysts that they are trying to achieve with a deadline of getting there or failing by end of 2021.  So for me it is easy to stay invested in these plays.  I know as long as they are on track to hit or miss on the catalyst I just do nothing.  That is why all my plays are for 2021 before I ""throw in the towel"".

Nearly ALL my plays I found on this subreddit.  They are just lost in the many threads on the same ""hot"" stock or the rocket ship everyone is trying to jump on at the moment.",10xwannabe,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/n3v9d4/recaf_was_just_featured_on_cnn/gwtgdjm/,0.127,0.725,0.148,0.8891

Providence Film Group (subsidiary) signed an EB5 sponsor agreement for $50m

PSRU owns ABA Canada and now has several key staff positions in place.  They are actively interviewing for startup teams in Ontario and Quebec.  Intend to expand from there.

PSRU owns 2 ABA teams in the US (Hollywood Action and Beverly Hills Majestics).  Key staff in process of being hired.

Information is a little sparse because they took over a fluorescent lighting company and are now a Sports and entertainment company.  

Investor Relations told me that OTC Markets. com has the correct information.  They are current on filings.  You will see there are only 382 million shares Outstanding.  40 million of those are restricted.  Market cap, for what they own, is far lower than it should be.  Check the Short Interest....rather eye popping.  If this gets any upward, sustained movement, a minimal gamma squeeze will bring this 1600% - 2400% very quickly (closer to it's reasonable value) $0.15 - $0.35.

132,VST," [VST.CN](https://VST.CN) VSQTF

I've been in this and watching it daily for 6 months. I have 30,000 shares so I'm paying close attention.

This company turned profitable half a year ago. Then, they bought into rapid COVID tests. I think that is the cash cow that is driving them.

They are being shorted. The short seller is using a different broker than before, so it might be someone driving the price down to take a long position. If you have a stop-loss, you will lose your shares before it takes off.

The financial statements say the company needs financing and that it shouldn't be a problem getting it. Those statements are dated 4 months ago but were written recently. That is, they know perfectly well that the company has since been buying its own shares back with their extra cash. 

It's a fire sale. I'd buy more but one of their portfolio companies, FUNFF [FANS.CN](https://FANS.CN), is being shorted, too. This one is by the same broker as the original short seller of VST, so they might be trying to cover. I think it's a fire sale too and my position is smaller so I want more.",Y1OG4,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/n3xsk0/vsqtf_eps_up_200_revenue_up_200_under_the_radar/gwtrz2z/,0.04,0.845,0.115,0.9192

139,TDA," Unfortunately, On TDA there isn't much information for me to talk about.  I like the low share count (TDA shows 12.5 M shares outstanding).  Avg daily volume at 89.5K is alright...at least there is trading going on.  Today 115K traded already.  It looks like it swings pretty good.  In the past 5 days it moved between .015 and just over .04.  Good if you can get in at the lower end and exit at the higher end...easy doubling of your money.  As far as the financials go or if the company is growing, I cannot say as I don't see any filings for them listed.",Bmit179,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/n41h1b/crmbq_could_there_be_room_to_grow/gwt4bx2/,0.058,0.769,0.174,0.9081
