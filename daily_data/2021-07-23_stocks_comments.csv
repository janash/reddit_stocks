The biggest risk IMO comes from the US. Chinese companies benefit from being able to list in the US while the benefit to the US and US investors is much less clear.

28,BABA," I would think it’s the other way around. The benefit of an ADR is free foreign money for them and a more limited upside for US.  ADR’s are a receipt of a receipt. You don’t own a piece of BABA when you buy on an American market. You own a shell company contract that follows a percentage of the company’s success/failure. But since they are not a free market the numbers can be fudged, and a company could technically be boosted or knocked down by the CCP.

>The guidance assumes gross margins miss analyst estimates as the 59.2% rate in Q2 falls with a dip to 55.0% in Q3. With the Q1 gross margins up at 58.4%, the implied guidance has margins dipping to possibly as low as 53.0% in Q4. The number clearly has to fall below the Q3 margin rate to average 56.5% this year.

>The warning on the stock for years now has been this disappointing trend of business eventually declining. The stock has pretty much traded flat since 2018 due to this persistent weakness of the business.

>Investors must consider what happens the one quarter where Intel doesn't smash estimates. If sales actually dip 9% in Q4, the stock is highly unlikely to trade higher than the current price.

Takeaway

>The key investor takeaway is that investors must avoid Intel until the company figures out how to turn around the manufacturing business to produce next generation chips in a timely manner. The company is quickly heading towards a scenario where FCFs won't cover much more than the annual dividend payment as margins remain under pressure due to competition from the likes of AMD.

57,TSM," You realize the lag in semi conductors is years long right? TSM is just living off their past advantage. Intel perused a different path with process technology - and it's quite possible they did that knowing there would be short term pain but long term gain. In which case TSM would be screwed during the coming years. We just don't know right now. We do know that their current advantages are the result of decisions made more than 5 years ago and not anything recent.

58,SAM," Here's some context to the financials: https://imgur.com/a/8cwTHNg


I personally think it's a huge over-reaction. Revenue is still good, and Income is in-line with its good performance. SAM was extremely overpriced, but the past few months brought it into more reasonable valuations (compared to their historical valuation averages).


I have yet to decide if I want to buy in, if I can, at a low open. Arguing with Mr. Market can be risky... but 20% is as if there was some damning news where they had income losses or something.

Exactly.  Take Google and YouTube TV.  Google has lower expense as they get to leverage the existing YouTube infrastructure.   So a fundamental advantage over competitors.

But then it is even more true on the revenue side.  Nobody has more data than Google so they get to use with targeting ads with YouTube TV and therefore able to fundamentally create more revenue than competitors.

90,USA, cloudflare has the support of firefox and firefox already uses them for HTTPS DNS by default in USA and as an option outside of USA.

91,AMZN," Copy-paste from myself, from another post that asked the same 2 days ago:

\`\`\`

I am a DevOps Engineer, and I have worked a lot with Cloudflare and Fastly technologies. Therefore, I laughed a bit of the initial valuation. I have bought near the IPO at $19.27 and accumulated until it was my second biggest position when it dropped from \~$40+ to $34. I have sold half at $80, bought back at $67 and sold everything at $102.  
  
Cloudflare is the better one between the two in my professional experience. Cloudflare is also a ""sort-of"" moat since they invested a lot in CDN infrastructure and it's extremely hard even for AMZN/MSFT/GOOGL to close in on them.  
  
Right now they are extremely overvalued and I would wait for it to drop to at least $50-60. Assuming they turn on the money printer at \~33% profit margin and keep on growing the revenue 50% YoY (which is extremely far-fetched IMO), only after 5 years will they reach a fair value for the market cap that they have today ($35B with $7.5B in revenue and $2.5B in earnings). For 40% growth YoY it will take them 8 years, whereas for 30% it will take them almost 11 years.  
  
There are far better valued companies (including tech stocks).

&#x200B;

IMO, FSLY is a much better value right now compared to NET. They have improved A LOT in the last year (the TikTok scandal scared them a bit :) ) when it comes dependency to dependency on ""big clients"", but they are still overvalued right now IMO because they carry more risks.  
  
They are not a moat like Cloudflare. They share almost all their availability zones with AWS and Azure, which both provide their own CDNs. They are not as diversified as Cloudflare right now, but they are improving that with their edge cloud platform, although that's heavily focused on mobile solutions, whereas Cloudflare provides the same functionality for enterprise applications.  
  
The really scary thing for me for both NET and FSLY is Amazon and Microsoft. NET is much better there since they have a better infrastructure and are focusing on cybersecurity and DNS too (which I don't see AMZN or MSFT diving into). FSLY is at risk there, since they share most of their infrastructure with the 2 giants. If either of them decides to invest a lot into creating a solid CDN and edge computing platform (which they both have plenty of cash on hand to invest into this endeavor), FSLY would take a huge hit. If that happens AWS and Azure could steal a lot of clients even if their service would be a bit worse, because they host most of the applications that are out there and can work on providing a very easy integration, whereas with Fastly you would need to configure it yourself which implies extra costs (paying someone who knows how to do it and time lost + maintaining the setup) which would deter most product owners.  
  
With regards to CDN usage, in my experience, Cloudflare is much easier to use by the broader public. The Fastly documentation and support sucked last time i have used them (2 years ago). I don't mind it since that's my job, but Cloudflare offers a very easy to setup solution that requires no DevOps skills at all for basic setup.  
  
TL;DR: FSLY is better valued now, but carries more risks (hence the lower valuation).

\`\`\`

I am a DevOps Engineer, and I have worked a lot with Cloudflare and Fastly technologies. Therefore, I laughed a bit of the initial valuation. I have bought near the IPO at $19.27 and accumulated until it was my second biggest position when it dropped from \~$40+ to $34. I have sold half at $80, bought back at $67 and sold everything at $102.  
  
Cloudflare is the better one between the two in my professional experience. Cloudflare is also a ""sort-of"" moat since they invested a lot in CDN infrastructure and it's extremely hard even for AMZN/MSFT/GOOGL to close in on them.  
  
Right now they are extremely overvalued and I would wait for it to drop to at least $50-60. Assuming they turn on the money printer at \~33% profit margin and keep on growing the revenue 50% YoY (which is extremely far-fetched IMO), only after 5 years will they reach a fair value for the market cap that they have today ($35B with $7.5B in revenue and $2.5B in earnings). For 40% growth YoY it will take them 8 years, whereas for 30% it will take them almost 11 years.  
  
There are far better valued companies (including tech stocks).

&#x200B;

IMO, FSLY is a much better value right now compared to NET. They have improved A LOT in the last year (the TikTok scandal scared them a bit :) ) when it comes dependency to dependency on ""big clients"", but they are still overvalued right now IMO because they carry more risks.  
  
They are not a moat like Cloudflare. They share almost all their availability zones with AWS and Azure, which both provide their own CDNs. They are not as diversified as Cloudflare right now, but they are improving that with their edge cloud platform, although that's heavily focused on mobile solutions, whereas Cloudflare provides the same functionality for enterprise applications.  
  
The really scary thing for me for both NET and FSLY is Amazon and Microsoft. NET is much better there since they have a better infrastructure and are focusing on cybersecurity and DNS too (which I don't see AMZN or MSFT diving into). FSLY is at risk there, since they share most of their infrastructure with the 2 giants. If either of them decides to invest a lot into creating a solid CDN and edge computing platform (which they both have plenty of cash on hand to invest into this endeavor), FSLY would take a huge hit. If that happens AWS and Azure could steal a lot of clients even if their service would be a bit worse, because they host most of the applications that are out there and can work on providing a very easy integration, whereas with Fastly you would need to configure it yourself which implies extra costs (paying someone who knows how to do it and time lost + maintaining the setup) which would deter most product owners.  
  
With regards to CDN usage, in my experience, Cloudflare is much easier to use by the broader public. The Fastly documentation and support sucked last time i have used them (2 years ago). I don't mind it since that's my job, but Cloudflare offers a very easy to setup solution that requires no DevOps skills at all for basic setup.

251,ANVS," Completely disagree with this.  

Getting in when products are in Phase 1 is where you can make most money, but it is high risk.  Usually see shares \~$5 or less for those companies.

My personal strategy is to pick 15-20 companies with what I consider promise and divide the investment chunk pretty equally between them.  One single company that has product going to market will pay for the losses on others.  Current example, ANVS.  Average cost was \~$5.50/share and trading over $115 right now.  Actually considering buying up.

Early Phase 2 when data starts to reads out is less risky, but you sometimes pay a premium.  Sit on a watch list, set your alerts, or use limit buys for these.

Late Phase 2 can already be priced out of consideration for many.

Rarely do I lose ""everything"" on the ones that fail a single product because they have diverse pipelines.  Sometimes they even get bought out by a bigger company.

Buy a handful of extra shares when they're cheap.  Example, aim for 115 or 120 instead of 100 and plan to sell 15-20 shares throughout gains to recoup investment.",HotSarcasm,-1,/r/stocks/comments/opyvko/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_jul/h69a4bd/,0.087,0.807,0.106,0.6985

COVERED CALLS ARE NOT FREE MONEY, THEY ARE A HEDGE.

By selling covered calls you ARE betting against the growth of stock that you own. Yes, it absolutely CAN be profitable, but  there is risk. If you get assigned, you may lose money if the market exceeds strike+premium. Yes, even if you don't re-buy, you still lost on the gains you would have made if you didn't sell the call. If you opt to sell puts instead of re-buying you are once again betting against growth: if the market gain exceeds premium collected you've missed gains again (but the reverse is also true).

CC/CSP strategies require a certain set of conditions to get good gains. **You need growth, but not too much. You need the expectation of volatility, but not the actual price volatility.** If the underlying drops more than your premiums, you lose money, if it gains past your strike more than your premiums, you also lose.

By selling covered calls you ARE betting against the growth of stock that you own. Yes, it absolutely CAN be profitable, but  there is risk. If you get assigned, you may lose money if the market exceeds strike+premium. Yes, even if you don't re-buy, you still lost on the gains you would have made if you didn't sell the call. If you opt to sell puts instead of re-buying you are once again betting against growth: if the market gain exceeds premium collected you've missed gains again (but the reverse is also true).

CC/CSP strategies require a certain set of conditions to get good gains. **You need growth, but not too much. You need the expectation of volatility, but not the actual price volatility.** If the underlying drops more than your premiums, you lose money, if it gains past your strike more than your premiums, you also lose.

311,RE," Most folks already covered the basics. Stocks are much easier but you are paying a premium for being hands off. This comes in a couple of big ways.

First you are paying the company to do the work and they will charge you whatever they want for the most part. If the CEO wants $10m a year good luck saying otherwise even if they arent worth $100k.

Many companies in RE do a lot of shady things from allowing external management with conflicting interest to making bad deals to benefit insiders. Thats stocks for you but I will say its more pervasive in RE because of how easy it is to hide any obvious bad behavior. Im not trying to scare you from REITs, or other RE stocks, I own plenty but thats one risk. Bad management and management cost. A lot of bad actors in RE be it stocks or in the real market.

Second, you dont get to enjoy the property value gains. Generally speaking the value of REIT stock is attached to dividend and div growth rather than property value. They are also very sensitive to interest rate changes. But to give an example, I have a few properties and they have gained about 20%-30% equity since January and I can sell them right now for that amount or I can cash out a loan if I wanted. REITs dont follow property value however. They are up right now but in general they are following the stock market rather than real estate market. For example, the REITs crashed back in March due to COVID, but did property values actually go down in March? The answer is no. That said the opposite can happen too. You may have periods when property value is down but stocks are up. The point here is real estate stocks are still stocks and dont directly reflect real estate fundamentals. This can be bad or good depending on market valuation.

All that said, buying property is no picnic. Again, folks here have commented on this already. Though I have never, in 20 years received a 3am phone call, it obviously can happen. And yes you need to do deal with iffy tenants every now and then but in my experience this is much more rare than people think.

The bias online that a lot of tenants are bad is because those are the only landlords who post... you dont see landlords posting about their good tenants so there will be negative bias. Its not true. There are bad tenants but honestly the worst I have had is one who had kids who were unruly and the HOA got involved. We dealt with it and the tenant had to move but it really wasnt a nightmare or anything. Actually I did have one tenant that also damaged a property but then again... they were there for around 10 years so it really wasnt a huge issue except that they were a-holes at the end. But they left, and I made my money and that was that. But thats just 2 tenants over 20 years and I have several properties... they are the exception, not the rule.

I would avoid buying hard assets right now. Property values are nuts and you are competing with no inspection and other unfavorable terms as a buyer. I would let it cool down. Also when the moratorium on rent ends I am expecting condos and town homes to come on the market and cool that sector off a bit... I am not expecting many detached homes though.

If you go stock, all I can do is tell you what I am doing. Right now I am avoiding all retail, office, industrial and residential.

* Residential because they will get hardest by the moratorium end and I want to see where they land.
* Retail because it has sucked for more than a decade and I see no end to them sucking (online shopping trend).
* Office because employers are realizing they may not need them. Work from home is cheaper and more productive for many industries. How will this hit office? I am not sure so I am avoiding.
* I generally dont like industrial because they tend to be unpredictable and their properties are not very valuable. They have a harder time raising rent except in rare instances but that goes back to being unpredictable.

What am I buying? Healthcare REITs especially senior care and housing. They cut their divs last year due to COVID but their fundamentals are strong. We already saw a little bit of consolidation happen, which is good for efficiency and I expect huge dividend growth the next 2-3 years as cash flows recover from COVID. Their properties are also pretty nice because they tend to be in desirable locations.

Not recommending you buy property or stock right now but thats where I am.",thejumpingsheep2,12,/r/stocks/comments/opqg7m/are_reits_a_good_way_to_get_into_re_or/h679d6e/,0.121,0.75,0.129,0.777
312,EQC," Lotta ways you can take this question.

If you’re a homeowner you already have a good chunk invested in real estate. Food for thought. Outside of that, REITs or RE in general is a good inflation hedge. REITs you get exposure to commercial RE rather than just residential.

If you want to speculate on your own buying a piece of RE outside of a home, kind of different - a piece of land or something. Kinda risky there, you’ll have to pay taxes on it until someone decides they want to buy it from you.

314,UK," I mean, a stock has physical assets and locations. Even the most tech savvy company. You could probably go and visit / touch most of them if that's your deal. 

&#x200B;

Outside of that, I have considered buying property too, but being UK based, I am not able to put my income from renting into a tax advantaged ISA (no tax). So any rent is going to be taxed at 40% income and 32% CGT, versus either 15% for dividend from most US stocks and 0% for all UK stocks I hold, and 0% capital gains on both. That's before we even consider either the cut a management company will take or the dreadful idea of being woken by a tenant at 3AM / having to evict them. Speaking of, regulations. 

&#x200B;

Naw, I'll stick to stocks, including REITs btw, for the forseeable future.

319,RE," I think that when the moratorium ends we will get a slight cooling but like I said above, it think it will be mostly condos, townhomes and multiunit properties. I really dont think you will see many detached homes except maybe, in less desirable areas. There will be some, but I dont think there will be many.

Still the new influx of inventory might cool things a bit but it might take a month or two before they start to hit the markets. I also dont expect there to be any sort of desperation by the sellers because these will all be investment units thus the owners probably have money. They arent going to accept just any low ball offer.

I generally avoid rentals if cap rate is under 5% and I stick to highly desirable cities. You can usually find better cap rates in slums and less desireable but that also comes with worse tenants.

Right now I cant get 5%+ so I am using stocks. Again I am not some guru or anything and I want to point out that my methods of investing are not popular. I keep a lot of cash on the sideline. Normally up to 50% though right now its 25%. Again, thats just me. Ask others and they will say I am stupid. When I mention my performance, they call me a liar. I am just some  no face behind a keyboard after all.

I would say stick to REITs for now. Do not go all in, keep cash on the side and plan a hedging strategy that you can execute in a matter of minutes be it options, inverse index or defensive counterbalances. They all work if done right.

321,ATH," That's always a risk with rentals. Then there are horror stories of bad renters. I don't have rental yet but I live in one of the fast growing cities, I'm kicking myself for having not invested in a property/properties a few years ago. Some of the real estate have almost double in price in the past 5 years. I think it depends on your local market and the location and condition of your property. I have a lot of friends who have rentals, very few times they may have had to wait for a couple of months in between renters, but usually you have a few months to find a new renter before the current one moves out. Our market is hot right now. My concern right now is that the real estate is at ATH, the rent is also inflated, if you buy a property now, later on, the price of the rent drops when the market cools down, you get stuck with a high mortgage but lower rent for either short term or long term depending on the market.",marsladybug,1,/r/stocks/comments/opqg7m/are_reits_a_good_way_to_get_into_re_or/h67o2fo/,0.064,0.901,0.035,-0.5023

I think there will be a pull back at some point, but I have no way of telling when, just like the stock market, it could go up a little more then slowly pull back. IMO, the pull back won't go as fast as the way up. If you check on Zillow often enough, you might notice some trends. It doesn't hurt to get familiar with the market for when you are ready.

Since you're investing and DCAing, stick with the tried and true VOO/VTI stuff.

""As an alternative to ARK funds, look at GIGE. Actively managed, but highly diversified with speculative growth companies. Also look at QQQJ and XITK. Those are backed up by huge funds that know their stuff and diversified with growth companies, too.

I own ARKG only because I don't know anything about the space and the holdings are unique for biotech ETF. But also look at XPH for biotech.

Since you're investing and DCAing, stick with the tried and true VOO/VTI stuff. 

Also consider M1 finance and making a ""pie"" for yourself that you can add monies to every month and include companies you really like from, say, ARK. I'm a fan of JD, for instance, as a long hold. You can hold VOO there, too. 

I honestly think you can make a portfolio out of ETFs run by State Street (XLK, XPH, etc.) and Invesco (QQQ and others) and strike a great middle ground for the sort of long term growth you're looking for. Won't need to research and can stay overweight in, say, tech with XITK. QQQ doesn't hold SQ, for instance. You want ETFs that will pick up those growth stocks, too.

I like ARK. But I wouldn't buy it right now. I bought ages ago. I don't think it'll blow up. But I also think the low hanging fruit is gone in many growth stocks.""",play_it_safe,1,/r/stocks/comments/oq5guh/looking_options_for_a_diversified_200k_etf/h69q3z4/,0.028,0.788,0.184,0.9913
347,IMO," >70% in low risk/fix income ETF 

HDV, SCHD, FDVV and similar ETFs are focused on stocks with higher dividends, mostly larger, established slow and steady companies. a low-volatility ETF like ACWV might be a good option, too, potentially 

not ETFs but you might want to consider balanced mutual funds for part of the portfolio. for example, the Dodge & Cox Balanced Fund (DODBX) is almost 100 years old, 1931 inception, one of the oldest funds on wall street and still following its original mandate (~70% blue chip stocks, 30% fixed income). Dodge & Cox has an absolutely stellar reputation [ https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/business/mutfund/dodge-cox-mutual-funds.html ]. or the Vanguard Wellington fund (VWELX) similar but IIRC closed to new investors for now, the Vanguard Wellesely Income Fund (VWINX). Fidelity Puritan (FPURX) or Balanced Funds (FBALX), or the T Rowe Price Balanced Fund (RPBAX). YMMV, but longevity counts for something in my book. 

as for growth, I'd be a little suspicious of QQQ. it's very trendy and IMO over-valued and I'd prefer a broader growth option that's not so tech concentrated. some of the best performing stocks of the past 20 years are not tech, such as Monster Beverage and Tractor Supply.

350,IMO," Sounds like you're already aware of the high risks of trading the pinks. The OTC market is tiered with OTCQX being the top and most in accordance with regulations and transparent regarding their business, OTCQB being the middle lacking somewhat in meeting certain requirements of the OTC, and then there's the Pink (limited information available) and then the Grey (no information or suspicious information).
Pantheon is on the Pink bc it trades on the London exchange and uses the OTC to trade in the US open market. As such their activities/information is delayed or not meeting the same requirements. It is flagged for showing a ""neutral pattern"" which is to say they haven't really put a lot of effort into filing up to date accounting records and/or have not been very active in trading activities. Basically, they've got a platform in Alaska that may or may not be operating or producing product along with some acreage in the east Texas area that may or may not have any rigs producing product. 
IMO, It appears they picked up a platform on the cheap after it was played out by one of the big riggers and parlayed that into some acreage in Texas (near but not in the Permian). They seem to have the capital in London but don't seem to interested to invest it in their US holdings. 
Historically, these type of stock offerings rarely amount to much. IMO, unless you intend to really grind the highs and lows of its limited movement (which is equivalent to throwing darts blindfolded) I'd recommend taking the profits and work with a stock with more transparency and predictability.",BigDanPAZ,2,/r/stocks/comments/opqymc/pantheon_resources/h67fqp3/,0.049,0.9,0.051,0.139

365,TD," I would move the 12k over to TD or move both the 12k and 9k to a different broker that offers free trades if TD doesn’t. Consolidating just helps manage better. 

Then I would invest in index ETFs. Looks for S&P500 and small cap ETFs with super low expense ratios like VOO and VB. 

I would also put a small amount into a leveraged ETF. Something like TQQQ. You won’t quite get the triple leverage unless you day trade it, but you still get a pretty good return on good days. It’s very volition so not for the weak stomach. High risk high reward type stuff. They also make inverse leveraged ETFs for when the market drops. I only recommend the leveraged ETFs if you are prepared to loss your money that you invest in them if something goes horribly wrong such as a market crash right after you buy a bull leveraged ETF. That said you are young and have many years of investing ahead of you. Good way to get a nice nest egg going if you buy in the the market goes in the right direction for you.

371,PLTR," This is an important question. The answer depends on your goal, and market conditions.

What do I mean by a goal? It sounds crazy to set  goal when you're dealing with share prices that you can't control⏤right?

A goal has four components:

1. Capital to allocate.
2. Target % gain.
3. Deadline.
4. Amount you're willing to lose.

Once you're clear on a goal, you can start identifying stocks to help you to achieve that goal. Without a goal, you have no criteria for making decisions about when to buy or sell, in service to *your* goal. At best, you'd only be using indicators (that don't actually indicate much of anything) such as RSI or MACD to make superficial decisions.

Sure, some stocks will 10x⏤if you get lucky, and wait ten or twenty years. Is that your goal? If you want cash now, then what you should be doing is finding volatile stocks that will *move*, not value traps that trap your capital and don't go anywhere for years. On the other hand, if you want to make a killing and have ten years, buy PLTR now and wait.

You also need to decide what approach to making gains you want to take. Some people want to passively invest. Others want to actively trade. Sure, you want to know what the ""best"" approach is, but the answer will depend on what your own capabilities as an investor or trader are.

Your question is posed in a way that suggests a cautious, long-term investing temperament. That's fine, but the tradeoff is time. You need to wait, and wait. To make money quickly, there's no real choice but to trade or execute options strategies. So, you need to decide whether you want to take a long-term investing approach, or learn to trade. If the latter, you need to be prepared for a multi-year journey that involves a great deal of reading and experimentation, and significant losses on the way. One of the most important things that you'd learn along that journey is that market conditions change drastically. Strategies that used to work stop working. Others might make money by investing in index funds, while you go through fallow periods, or periods where you lose money. It feels demoralizing, but is part of the learning journey to become a trader.

Of course, you can do both, using long-term investing to build wealth, and trading (swing trading in bullish market conditions, and options trading in all conditions) to generate cash. 

Part of what you're asking involves predicting the future. No one can do that. A long-term investor will perform fundamental analysis and ongoingly analyze annual reports, and keep adding money to a strong position, through thick and thin, while a trader will typically sell after gaining 20% and move on, regardless of the merit of a particular stock, because the goal is rapid *compounding*.

In summary: set a goal. Decide whether you want to be a long-term investor or a trader, or both. Be prepared for a long learning journey (but *not* an impossible one). If you want to learn more, private message me. I lead a learning community that takes a macroeconomic, fundamental, technical, and statistical approach to investing and trading. We don't peddle fantasies, but show people who want to learn where to get data, how to analyze it, and how to use a particular strategy (we have documents) for appropriate market conditions to make money as safely and as quickly as possible. We don't sell anything, but we do expect anyone who joins us to be deadly serious and treat the work like a job. 

On a personal note, we've seen extreme sensitivity in the unprofitable small-cap tech stocks to the CPI. The higher that that number increases each month, the more large sell-offs of those types of stocks we expect to see. If the CPI rises enough, it could literally trigger a market crash. If I were you, I'd take the money from gains and run. Now is not the time to think about holding for years. The market is going to move down. One of our trading principles is, ""Keep cash on hand to buy ships on sale."" If you don't have cash, you won't be able to do that. 

The market is in risk-off mode. Almost every valuation is sky-high. When you're on a cliff, there's only one place left to go. 

Good luck, and if you'd like any more information, feel free to reach out privately.
