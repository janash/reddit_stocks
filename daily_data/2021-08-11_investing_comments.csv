6,SA," This. He was talking about **Security Analysis** from 1936. Graham himself died in 1976. 

Also we should know about the context of Graham's words and emphasize what ""useless"" is.

>*“I am no longer an advocate of elaborate techniques of security analysis in order to find superior value opportunities. This was a rewarding activity, say, 40 years ago, when our textbook ""Graham and Dodd"" was first published;* 

Problem with quotes (or just looking at P/Es) is that it doesn't give you a full picture. Data is nothing but numbers without CONTEXT. Dots between lines on a piece of paper without the CONTEXT of it being music. Etcetc.

That SAME QUOTE from above goes on (strangely omitted by OP)

>***but the situation has changed a great deal since then. In the old days any well-trained security analyst could do a good professional job of selecting undervalued issues through detailed studies; but in the light of the enormous amount of research now being carried on, I doubt whether in most cases such extensive efforts will generate sufficiently superior selections to justify their cost. To that very limited extent I'm on the side of the ""efficient market"" school of thought now generally accepted by the professors.”*

So here's a few things WITH CONTEXT:

* Graham was talking about A TEXTBOOK called ""Graham and Dodd's Security Analysis"". Textbooks go out of date **EVERY YEAR** because of the college/education text book industry needs to charge $300-500 a book. They get updated, re-updated, re-reupdated, with extra synopsis from X guy, or foreword from guy Y ([like Warren Buffett](https://www.amazon.com/Security-Analysis-Foreword-Warren-Buffett/dp/B083PQCDRJ/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Security+Analysis&qid=1628698618&sr=8-1))

* Graham also followed up his own SA with Intelligent Investor.

* Graham was also talking about SA in the ***context of using the teachings of SA to do professional grade analysis and investing***. By the late 1970's, things have evolved. Data was more available, computers were catching on, investment analysis was done in groups, etctetcetc. When there is money to be made people catch on quick. If you're using the same investing methods from the 1970's then you would have gotten killed by quants from the 90/00's let alone in 2021.

* ""sufficiently superior selections to justify their cost"" is another major factor. Index ETFs were not a thing yet, but it was moving along that route. But even in 1979, ***MOST*** people reading SA, analyzing, and investing themselves probably wouldn't beat just investing in Berkshire Hathaway.

* ""To that very limited extent I'm on the side of the ""efficient market"" school of thought now generally accepted by the professors."" Context of the statement is here. Graham at that point basically is admitting things we know now are mostly true and r/investing knows/advises: (almost) everything is priced in, you bench yourself against the S&P, most people don't consistently beat the market, and you should probably just buy an ETF like VOO.

* Graham said that at the end of the 1970's in his later years. The 70's was a time of Stagflation which might have impacted his thinking and belief.

As for my opinion on this. I agree with Graham. His words hold true more than before. There is more data available than the average investor can handle and access has eased, but now the average or semi-pro is competing against groups of Ivy grads/quants on the technical/fundamental/statistical/algo level. It doesn't mean you don't read Security Analysis or Das Kapital, Wealth of Nations, The Art of War, The Bible, The Prince, and/or other great/foundational works. It doesn't mean reading these books don't make you better. These books are only **""""""useless""""""** in the context that they ALONE won't make you an socialist revoluationary+leader, a top economist, a warlord, top level politican, the pope, or a pro trader/investor because the world has evolved. Art of War was originally written to be read by emperors, top generals, and the top aristocracy only. Everyone can read it now. And everyone DOES read these books because they are now necessary reading in schools precisely because they offer great insights/knowledge/groundwork.

 The issue in a discussion on asset allocation is where does it fit in?  Likely an ""alternative asset class"".  So, make sure that 2% is NOT coming out of any fixed income allocation (bonds and cash). 

I have 5% of my portfolio in a few individual companies each constituting 1% of my portfolio size.  One is crypto because I believe in the project/ tech so made the same exception as you did.

I got into BTC back in 2012. Then I became a software engineer in the financial markets and realized that BTC is cool, but it doesn't really solve anything for any law abiding citizen in a developed economy. Unless you live under an oppressive regime or are laundering money or e committing fraud, then at least most (if not all) cryptocurrency really is worthless. It's slow, it doesn't scale, it's a huge waste of energy, there are no protections if you lose your password or the exchange gets hacked, etc etc. 

Maybe there is a place for smart contracts. NFTs are akin to collectibles, so also not an investment imo, but at least they have some utility in games, galleries, etc. But your standard cryptocurrency like BTC, I'd pass and think they'll be pretty much worthless in a decade. If I were so inclined to gamble on crypto, ETH is the only one I can see a somewhat rational argument for after it switched to proof of stake. However, I still maintain that there are more efficient software solutions.

Some common misconceptions and there counter arguments:

- But it's decentralized!!! So? In a developed country, what does that do for you?
- You don't need to trust anybody! Except for the exchange you keep your wallet on, your ability to keep a safe password you don't forget and isn't hacked, your ability not to lose or have your computer destroyed, and 51% of the network.
- Hyper ledger solves the scaling problem! No, all it does is distribute the load across multiple inefficient solutions. It's really just a load balancer across a bunch of different non scalable systems.
- it provides banking for the unbanned! Look at who actually uses Bitcoin, usually not the unbanked
- People in places without formal banking infrastructure can use it to bank! They already use phone based money which is faster and cheaper
- If the US goes through inflation, you'll have your crypto! I'll also have my stock portfolio which will have raised costs and continue to make me money instead of just holding a digital gold brick
- if society collapses you can still use your Bitcoin! If society collapses, I'm not trading my food for a BTC period
- I've made a lot of money in XYZ. Cool story bro, that's called confirmation bias
- it will become the world's reserve currency! Not a chance. Deflationary currencies just don't align with economics because for money to be useful, it has to keep moving around. Deflation causes hoarding instead of spending.

* Is this advisable?

At 29 with no goals or need for the money you should be getting as much exposure as you can stomach in a drawdown. I'd recommend putting in a starter position and then learning as much as you can asap. BTC and ETH are quickly developing a supply shock and price is reflecting that. 

* Should I split it between BTC and ETH or should I keep everything in either BTC or ETH or should I consider some other altcoins too?

All BTC or 75/25 are both fine. ETH could grow more but rapid major upgrades has risks.

33,ETH," For BTC, perhaps. ETH is only 6 years old, it’s latest and greatest usecases (Defi and maybe NFTs - although I don’t like them in their current form) are approx. 1 year old.

34,ID," Smart contracts running on blockchain technology are *game changing*. 

One crazy sounding example: ""Flash Loans"" (which already exist in practice) can allow an anonymous person who has 

>a sure fire arbitrage trade, I just need access to a few hundred million USD...

 to instantly have access to that capital with no ID, and no collateral needed.

Imagine you could make a profit because you see Sally is offering BTC for $5 a coin, but Johnny is buying them for $5.06 each. The contract would be something like

Lenders ($100 million) -> Sally, who sends $100 million in BTC @ $5 -> Jonny sends $5.06 per BTC to -> Programmer wallet (keeps profit) -> Lenders (receive $100 million + fee).

Either all participants agree to the contract, and it activates as a single step when conditions are met (like money was instantly teleported between all parties who agree to the contract), or the terms aren't met, and the contract simply doesn't execute. No money changes hands, so there's no risk to saying ""Yeah, I'll take this smart contract deal if the other parties agree to it.""

The folks programing the contract, and the folks putting up the money do not need to know, nor trust one another - they just know either it'll work out and they individually make a profit, or nothing happens.

Imagine thousands of people being able to collectively loan the contents of their bank account out for arbitrage trades with zero risk to their account. They get their guaranteed return, or the contract simply doesn't execute, and no money changes hands.

Or imagine being able to donate to a charity and knowing with 100% certainty (due to the wording of the digital contract) that the money will be spent the way the contract says it will, completely eliminating any possibility of the group disappearing with the money.

There's a *lot* more to what smart contracts can do, but that particular example is the one that made me go from ""What's the real-world point?"" to ""Oh shit, this is a *big* deal.""",RandoStonian,1,/r/investing/comments/p220ix/is_it_a_pragmatic_decision_to_allocate_a_certain/h8jnos7/,0.07,0.804,0.126,0.9683

41,ID," You can leverage your crypto holdings (especially BTC and ETH) like land deeds for low interest loans.

You treat it like real estate deeds, and borrow dollars against the rising value over time, invest that money into business ventures, then use the returns to pay off the original loan + interest, unlocking your crypto for the next investment. Using the rising value of your holdings this way is tax free.

Networks like Bitcoin also have some major security features that can be 'borrowed' by other (faster, cheaper) services (so they don't have to build from scratch). In order to provide those services, the group running those services *must* pay the Bitcoin network in BTC.

Odds are good in the future that when you go get a new digital driver's license renewal, you'll pay a tiny fee to the registrar, and they'll bundle your information (along with 10s of thousands of other transactions), and spend some BTC (or another crypto-currency) to write a 'checkpoint' to the network with your data included.

46,ETH," >The two biggest tokens, bitcoin and ether, both have caps. Bitcoin will only ever have 21 million (or whatever it is...), ethereum after The Merge and moving to proof of stake will almost likely have deflationary issuance.

Yes, I’m aware that both have caps.  Which honestly brings problems of its own because currency deflation is not a good thing.

As you allude to later, yes, I’m talking about the fact that new cryptocurrencies can be released. ETH built new “land” when it was created, and future coins will continue to do that as well. 

>What do you mean by that? Do you mean somebody can just fork/copy btc or eth and make it valuable?  Who will provide security if the chain is forked?  The entire value of the blockchain is the security and consensus. Why would DeFi apps/users move to a forked chain if it was made? That would mean developing new apps for that chain (who will do that?), transferring all of the stablecoins that really power defi over to the new chain (who would do that?).

It wouldn’t just be a fork, but rather a different crypto that has technical and use advantages over bitcoin.  If ETH didn’t exist, wouldn’t some of that money have been invested in BTC instead? What’s the guarantee that in the long run, ETH or some other coin doesn’t win out over BTC?

>You are underestimating network effects that btc and eth have.  It would be like building an entirely new internet infrastructure and developing all new apps to run on that new internet. Who would do this and what benefits would it have over the current system?

Potentially, yes, I may be underestimating the network effects. But right now, especially for BTC, the price is almost entirely driven by speculation rather than actual day to day users. If a cryptocurrency actually has mass adoption for regular use (which in my view BTC never will), that currency would have an immensely powerful network effect.

> It wouldn’t just be a fork, but rather a different crypto that has technical and use advantages over bitcoin.

There's no guarantee though, not sure why you're even asking that. There's no guarantee that US stock will ever outperform again. Or that equities in general are a good investment.

I did fear this because like you said while Animal Crossing was amazing I was really disappointed on the lack of other games in 2020 and even for 2021 I don’t know any other games they’re releasing besides two Pokémon games that seemed really scuffed up in the trailer and a delayed Mega Man game.

I also think they could be doing so much more with Nintendo Online and making the E shop better, I don’t like how the E shop is filled with low quality games priced at $1 or so when how I remember the older E shops had quality software like old classics or more official Nintendo content or just quality as opposed to App Store type games on an official Nintendo product. 

They could also add all Gameboy games to the virtual console in Nintendo Online for a premium or just more features for Nintendo Online, seems like adding old games to that has been very slow and would be a great value add.

As for thoughts on the Nintendo park perhaps they are just licensing their IP out and getting a share of the profits because they don’t know how to run theme parks (?) not sure about their park situation at all but definitely something to look into.

I have owned every Nintendo console released in the US, I think they have some amazing IP (Zelda, Mario, Metroid to name a few), but I would not want to own their stock. They always seem to muddle along, some hits, some misses, but never really capitalizing on what they have.

You know what would make me super bullish? If they ever stopped making hardware and just developed software for other consoles. Personally I think all their hardware ideas are mostly gimmicks that don't do much to improve gameplay. I love Breath of the Wild, but my least favorite part is the annoying Joy Con controls. And he'll, if they felt they needed stuff like that, they could always sell custom controllers for other consoles.

In terms of nostalgia and the IP, maybe it's just me but I got one of the little Nintendo minis with the old games and it's a novelty to see those old games that I grew up playing, but I think I'm so used to today's online games that it's fun to see those old games, I didn't have that much fun playing them again. I said the other day that I'm surprised that someone hasn't gone activist on Nintendo - there's certainly potential there but for a long time feels like the potential has remained unrealized.

I do think that there's selling in game stocks (and not just Nintendo) partly due to people moving away from pandemic plays, but I think that's misguided.

70,IMO," As a gamer/investor, I think Nintendo suffers from lack of innovation like many Japanese companies.

If you look at their stock, it was doing really bad until they lucked out on the Switch and BOTW.   Having owned the system for 4 years now, I would say the technology they use compared to other consoles is unacceptable.  The new Switch uses same processor/gpu combo, where the dock seems more enticing than the actually unit.  No system should struggle at 720p 30fps in 2021/2022.

It's a cycle, and if their next gen console is not launched by 2022, or is a failure like Wii-U, their stock will drop back down to 2015 levels.

They've really gone 'head in the sand' with more than a handful of market trends. As you said, their IP could be leveraged to substantial levels that they're just simply not taking advantage of. Recent 1st party titles are already encountering major performance issues, because they opted for dated cellphone components, which also impacts 3rd party support. Online demand is at an all time high, and growing, yet their offering isn't even comparable to those systems in 2002. Finally, a huge number of their big releases are slated for mid to late 2022. By that time, the newer consoles will be seeing some of their more bespoke titles, which historically have been system sellers (not that availability has kept up with demand today).

83,TSLA," OP, the biggest glaring hole here is your bold claims about the CAGR for art and your use of the ""Artprice100"" index.

These are all heavily prone to survivor and selection biases.  You make general statements about ""contemporary art"" but only choose well known artists with known return.  For stocks, it would be the equivalent of saying ""stocks return 20% CAGR if you just ignore all the ones that do poorly.""

Let's look at the Artprice100.  From their website:

> This new scientific index is a new tool in Artprice’s panoply of proprietary decision-support tools. In effect, the Artprice100® index represents an unavoidable new benchmark in a financial world constantly searching for new investment opportunities in efficient markets.

Meaningless buzzwords, and they clearly don't know what the word ""scientific"" means.

> The index essentially identifies the 100 top-performing artists at auction over the previous five years who satisfy a key liquidity criterion (at least ten works of comparable quality sold each year). The weight of each artist is proportional to his/her annual auction turnover over the relevant period.

So, ignore all the artists that don't have impressive growth.

> The composition of the index does not change during the year. Therefore, the overall value of the Artprice100® evolves according to the individual average performances of each artist in the portfolio, adjusted according to his or her weight within the portfolio.

So there is no criteria for shifts in the index?  They just manually add or remove at the end of each year.  This makes it sound more like an active portfolio and less like a passive index.

> in 2000, the artist Pablo Picasso had a 16% weighting in the portfolio.

To compare, the DJIA only has 30 stocks but the largest weight is under 10%.  Even ARKK has 10% TSLA with under 60 holdings.

> In fact, the new index relies on a huge mass of market information (Artprice’s Big Data) and eliminates possible blind spots that might escape the Index’s Scientific Council by analysing repeat sales and auction results from all over the planet.  With its intranet connecting it with more than 6,300 Auction Houses, Artprice is the only organisation in the world that can process this data and produce an index based on a highly complex series of calculations.

Again with the buzzwords.  Apparently they are the only company in the world capable of calculating an index in an industry where trades happen quite slowly.

> Over 18 years, the Artprice100® grew by 360%, generating an average annual return of 8.9%.'

In my opinion, there are more or less only 5 public company stocks you can invest in for the AR space: Apple, Facebook, Snap, Google, and Unity. In the case of Apple, Google, and (to a lesser extent) Facebook, you're not directly investing in AR when you buy their stock and AR makes up a relatively small portion of forward revenue.

Obviously, investing in Unity is not a direct play on AR either, but outside of Epic Games (Unreal) or some other pre-IPO startup, they're probably the software company that's best positioned to benefit from the AR space.

I am thinking to put a minimum of 700 pounds a month in the SP 500. 

I understand that to live comfortably off dividends I have to reach at least 1million, however I'm wondering if you can withdraw from the SP 500 even just the yearly returns.

If I keep that 19% growth in the SP 500 and then in 10 years I decide to not keep it there but withdraw it, would that be possible?

122,ST," Making sure we are all clear...

in a covered call, you have the underlying stock at whatever you bought it at (your example sounds like 55); if the call buyer excercises for any reason, you get the share price in the call you wrote, and your shares are gone.  you keep the premium from the call and whatever $ the shares sell for.  you get taxed on a ST gain on the call premium and on whatever the gain was for the position in the underlying stock; in your example it sounds like $5 per share or $500 total gain on the stock sale.  Whether that is ST or LT depends on when you bought the underlying.

If you are covering a call with margin the mechanisms are all the same except that you will end up with a short stock position at the time of the call buyer exercising.  One call at 60 would be $6000 of margin short position in the stock.  Until you close this position there is no taxation, however, there is margin interest the broker will be charging you.

If you are buying shares on margin and then writing the call, you will get taxed on any $5 gain in your example, plus the call premium and you will owe margin interest.",LiqCourage,1,/r/investing/comments/p29ab2/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h8jgsrp/,0.009,0.831,0.16,0.9858

126,IMO, IMO its also important to note that different sectors behave differently and it is important to research the sector as a whole.,BirchInvestment,1,/r/investing/comments/p2fbwh/guide_on_researching_analyzing_performing_dd_on/h8k8hym/,0.0,0.841,0.159,0.3818
127,DCF," I basically just ignore any DD that doesn't very clearly address the negatives of the company, and watch out for positive indicators that can obfuscate its value eg.  Channel stuffing to prop up revenues but operating cash flow is terrible.

Any DD that can make a reasonable DCF model is probably worth its salt in my experience.",BuzzardBlack,1,/r/investing/comments/p2fbwh/guide_on_researching_analyzing_performing_dd_on/h8kuojf/,0.121,0.778,0.101,-0.3154

129,CLOV," You collect premium, shares get called away on expiry. Its just simple and straight forward. No tricks or catches. Maybe it gets called sooner if someone wants to exercise. The premium is only high because your selling low. It basically all equals out to the actual share price.  Sometimes you can make a little profit doing this.  For example im buying CLOV at 8.10 and selling 8CC for .54.  I'll make 44 profit in 2 days as long as it finishes above 8",pointme2_profits,14,/r/investing/comments/p2i1uc/what_happens_when_you_sell_covered_calls_that_are/h8k5aza/,0.065,0.806,0.129,0.6921

131,CC," Wait so if you hold a stock at 50, your cos basis is 50, and you sell a CC a month out at $10 then you're collecting the good premiums but also selling the $50 stock for $10, right? So you get the premium but sell the stock for much less than it's actually worth?

So basically it's not worth it?",Microtonal_Valley,1,/r/investing/comments/p2i1uc/what_happens_when_you_sell_covered_calls_that_are/h8k6vyg/,0.0,0.884,0.116,0.7343

134,IMO, Good points. I think the key is being able to connect their IP / “secret sauce” with future revenue growth potential.

136,IP," The point I'm stressing is that Fair Value implicitly takes into account the value of IP by mapping the historical conversion of IP to operating cash.  I think that's where you were going but I want to be clear that this is more of a way of saying:  The value of IP in the pipeline is accounted for by the forecast period that trends out expected growth in the footprint of the financial statements, and discounting that back to present value. We are not trying in this case to price what-ifs.

So in that sense, this is a value discussion rather than a growth discussion.",th3cr1t1c,1,/r/investing/comments/p2469u/intellectual_property_and_valuation_thoughts_from/h8j66cm/,0.015,0.762,0.223,0.9692
