One day before one of the judges finds me to tell me I won the prize so I should get my presentation ready on a USB for the next day.

12,RE," I can't seem to connect the dots here. Some random Swedish company with a turnover of $200k/year run by two middle-aged realtors is doing a hostile takeover on a Canadian clean oil recovery tech company? There's nothing else that shows up on the Swedish business when doing google research. I was ready to grab a speculative 15k stocks but it smells really fishy and I'm not sure what the play is for Uppgard Konsult.

The company history for both the owners of the consulting firm is weird as well and has a mixture of egg farm, realty, motocross speedway all with very little revenue.

Can't find any connections to Swedish multi-millionaires who can drop $100m+ on this takeover if it is 200 million stocks at 0.59. If it is someone with deep pockets, why would they use a tiny consulting firm that's linked to the real estate business probably to smuggle some of the RE sales profits out tax free rather than a more reputable entity.

67,BCTX," The discussion about Sabby/shorts still gives an air of naivety. Which is understandable - it's perfectly reasonable to think these executives aren't experienced penny stock traders. It's not just Sabby; all six companies who filed 13G's for BCTX are vulture funds. This is exactly the kind of lineup I look for, but only to buy when they've beat the stock to a pulp. The financing wasn't death spiral perhaps, but still included warrants which enable risk-free shorting.

The companies think ""great, the stock will rise when we have positive catalysts, the hedge funds will exercise the warrants and we'll get $30m more funding."" The problem is, the hedge funds don't want to exercise the warrants. They want to hold onto them as insurance to short the stock over and over again.
