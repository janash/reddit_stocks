15,TSLA," No, TLT is a short term play on the disgreement between the markets and the FED.  Short term rates are anchored by the FED, Long Term Rates (aka TLT) are not.  The Market has been pushing the long side of the curve higher bc they think that infltion is not transitory, while the FED ha anchored the short term side.  His play is volatility here imo, not neccesarily inflation, and he is so far correct.  

I think he has disliked TSLA for a long time and has a case, but over the short term, if you think markets will care about inflation, TSLA and most other growth stocks will continue to get punished, which is the other side of his bet - if you are going to bet againsy high PE growth stocks, why not bet against the highest PE most speculative one that also has the most liquidity after being picked up by every index fund in the US?

Right there with ya, got in at around 650 but my overall confidence in Tesla hasn't changed in the slightest. I'm tired of all the hate flung at Elon, he almost single handedly made electric vehicles cool AND forced every major auto manufacturer to get with the program.

21,AI," >  CEO that's pushing for next-gen technological integration, sustainable power, and planetary colonization

The benefit of the doubt is gone. No more ""eccentric"" personality excuses.

The man profited from bitcoin while claiming that it is harmful for the environment. Backstabbing all the people who trusted him and entered the market based on his word.

It's absolute lunacy what just happened. Not only did he put it on the balance sheet, he personally promoted it, he profited from it, and then trashed it.

Used public company money to do it. Complete disrespect and public humiliation of his investors. He made his shareholders look like bunch of bozos.

There are countless of people who live in countries with hyperinflation and general instability. Bitcoin is their lifeline. Can you imagine attacking that? How heartless can you be?

He should not be trusted with anything anymore, especially future oriented projects like AI, mission to mars and transhumanism. Those are very high risk endeavors involving life and death situations.

No serious technologist will ever forget this flip flopping betrayal. No competent engineer will continue to work for his companies. No true investor will own Tesla stock. No self-respecting individual will drive a Tesla.

He already lost 25 Billion last week and it's only the beginning.

Pair that with China FUD,Giga Berlin delay, and fear of non-transitory/transitory inflation and I say Tesla is going to have some problems.

And what has Elon been doing? Tweeting about crypto. Idk, I hope we get autonomous EVs and clean energy but things are not looking good . Elon has put Tesla in a weird positon with his ""by the end of the year"" promises and I'm not too sure they will recover. Their market dominance will dwindle.

Edit: Wanted to add that I do not think Tesla is anywhere close to Level 5 FSD. I believe they are ahead of competetion but the level of FSD Elon/Tesla promised 5 years ago is at least another 5-10 years out.

46,RKT," Looking at it from an earnings perspective, if a company makes $2.50 eps and has 100m shares outstanding, that’s $250m attributable earnings. Typically those attributable earnings will only drop a tiny fraction, likely the company’s opportunity cost of bank interest, for example say 0.5%.  If you take a company such as RKT for instance, it’s future earnings yield is approximately 15%.  When they buy back shares the earnings attributable to those shares bought back, now belongs to the remaining shares, so the remaining shareholders are making the net earnings yield, which bumps their EPS and value. In a sentence, the value of the company as a whole doesn’t change, but because there are fewer shares in issue, the value per share increases.  Obviously a company must weigh its opportunity cost against its earnings yield. If they can make 18% (would be fantastic), it would not make numbers sense to buy back if the overall earnings yield is 15%.

I've been googling for an hour for a straight answer on this.

So AT&T and DISCA are both selling off their media assets and creating a new entity (let's called it WBDC) that will stream both companies assets as a single streaming service.

They're saying that AT&T stockholders will own 71% of the new company and Discovery stockholders will own 29%.

So does this mean they're going to be issuing shares to anyone who owns either of those stocks? If I own both, will I now own T, DISCA & WBDC at some point?

Not to mention a rock Solid management team (lead by CEO Anthony Noto .. prior COO and CFO of twitter. Also prior CFO of the NFL). 

**3 Important moves**
1) Acquired Golden National Bank- as a fast track to gain its national charter.

2) Sofi acquired Galileo Technology (A financial platform/ software company) .. for $1.2Billion, which is likely worth $2B now. which will operate as its on entity.. and will have huge growth. Galileo supports the backend of various fintechs including Robinhood, Chime, and others. (this is a secret weapon in the valuation game going forward).

3) The move to give regular investors (account holders) access to pre-market IPO offerings (they will also be underwriting a number of offerings).

190,AMZN," That’s honestly exactly why I’m bullish. Sentiment is something that matters to retail even when it comes to their long-term picks but institutions invest on fundamentals (well, generally). And institutions are the ones that move markets, while retail is reactive

209,AMZN," Ah yes, the ""new to investing, help me get going post"". Here are some of the more popular options you can choose from:

1. If you are new, shoot for average like market wide ETFs.
2. Once you want more, learn to understand company financials (anything subscription services kills for example) and how different industries tick (like big tech vs fed rates). Then pic some companies to invest in. Another example being housing shortages and builders and wood prices... its pretty straight forward in hindsight, just a pain in the ass and time consuming in the moment to get right. You really gotta love this as an obsessive hobby to have a shot at out performing the market by even a couple percent.
3. If you want even more, and have done step 2 successfully, learn TA and macro economic analysis and figure out how to approximate bottoms, and add in call options when you are confident the market is done selling off. This is usually a gamble, but the few who do figure it, do quite well. Or go to WSB and learn to yolo. The opposite of calls are puts, so learn to call tops and bet the market is going down.
4. Once you are done being a trader and don't want to loose any more money or don't want to loose what you made, look up Ray Dalio's method for investing, copy that, and you will be one of the most diversified investors period. **Your portfolio wont do much aside from stay a step ahead of inflation, but that is what diversification is more or less designed to do.**

I recommend you try the second option just to see if you like it. If you don't, go to option 1 with a few companies you have gut feelings about, making sure the companies are in the sp500 and large caps, and not oil or linear TV. As time goes on, and you have something you don't want to loose, like you reached your lowest feasible retirement number and you are only 45, then open a second account and copy Dalio's strategy (#4) with your ""can't loose money"" and keep investing the rest of your excess cash in option 1 with a little bit of option 2 sprinkled in.

As far as specific stocks are concerned, the easiest way to find plays you can feel comfortable owning is to look up the holding of investors you have huge respect for, like Buffet, and take a few of their picks. Or look up the top 20 stocks owned by hedge funds and sprinkle some of those in. Or commit to option 2, and learn to do the work yourself. People here will have different convictions for different reasons, and most of the time they will all be tech biased anyway, which is not helpful to you since you already own a lot of Apple.

To answer your question, look at companies like KO or WMT, or DIS, or PG or AMZN (all fine options) that are more on the consumer cyclical side of the equation to get exposure elsewhere. Know that all of these will still sell off in a recession, so like I have alluded to above, and everyone has said elsewhere - what is the point? Pick the best growers, and buy them when you feel like capitalism is burning to the ground and the end of the world imminent.

If you don't, go to option 1 with a few companies you have gut feelings about, making sure the companies are in the sp500 and large caps, and not oil or linear TV. As time goes on, and you have something you don't want to loose, like you reached your lowest feasible retirement number and you are only 45, then open a second account and copy Dalio's strategy (#4) with your ""can't loose money"" and keep investing the rest of your excess cash in option 1 with a little bit of option 2 sprinkled in.

As far as specific stocks are concerned, the easiest way to find plays you can feel comfortable owning is to look up the holding of investors you have huge respect for, like Buffet, and take a few of their picks. Or look up the top 20 stocks owned by hedge funds and sprinkle some of those in. Or commit to option 2, and learn to do the work yourself. People here will have different convictions for different reasons, and most of the time they will all be tech biased anyway, which is not helpful to you since you already own a lot of Apple.

To answer your question, look at companies like KO or WMT, or DIS, or PG or AMZN (all fine options) that are more on the consumer cyclical side of the equation to get exposure elsewhere. Know that all of these will still sell off in a recession, so like I have alluded to above, and everyone has said elsewhere - what is the point? Pick the best growers, and buy them when you feel like capitalism is burning to the ground and the end of the world imminent.

214,TV," Ah yes, the ""new to investing, help me get going post"". Here are some of the more popular options you can choose from:

1. If you are new, shoot for average like market wide ETFs.
2. Once you want more, learn to understand company financials (anything subscription services kills for example) and how different industries tick (like big tech vs fed rates). Then pic some companies to invest in. Another example being housing shortages and builders and wood prices... its pretty straight forward in hindsight, just a pain in the ass and time consuming in the moment to get right. You really gotta love this as an obsessive hobby to have a shot at out performing the market by even a couple percent.
3. If you want even more, and have done step 2 successfully, learn TA and macro economic analysis and figure out how to approximate bottoms, and add in call options when you are confident the market is done selling off. This is usually a gamble, but the few who do figure it, do quite well. Or go to WSB and learn to yolo. The opposite of calls are puts, so learn to call tops and bet the market is going down.

I think you're over-thinking the whole thing.  Can a new API be constructed for a new service?  Obviously yes.  Does it matter if SMS goes away?  No, not really.  Will it?  Not anytime soon.  Even for those who are no longer using SMS, their phones still handle activation and control of some features using SMS in the background that the customer never sees (there's other services that use it as well).  It's going to be in place and usable in some fashion for quite a while.  I can tell you this isn't anything the cellular providers are talking about, simply because it's not a feature that's going to magically vanish in the next few years and at the network flow level, it's still used internally for a variety of purposes.

We keep everything separate at my company.  I use Slack for personal hangout / chats as well as work, but I never run more than one instance of one or the other, simply because it takes up too much screen real-estate to do that effectively.  But even as a handset manufacturer among other things, our employees are using /everything/ available to them... so long as it's secure enough.  

The spam on SMS, while annoying, could easily be rooted out and filtered away if the carriers wanted to make the effort.

SNE is too fickle for me. Their electronic products have been generally overpriced and not better than generic brands since the 90s. Their rep is in the gutter outside of Playstation. Though I like the PS brand you need to remember that consoles are slim margins (not really profitable). The real profit is in the software, not the console, so it will come down to releases and oh yea, there has been a lot of consolidation happening. For example, MS bought Bethesda, etc. Also I think that the aging gamer demographics are pushing people back to PC (Gen-X being the 1st to shift back) and there is a ton of pressure coming from cloud based gaming consoles by companies like MS, Google and Amzn and, of course, mobile. So no one really knows where Sony is going to be 20 years from now.

279,DCF," >I think the PS5 might be somewhat priced in

May I ask how you figured it's priced in? Would be super interested to hear your thoughts considering, Sony's stock is already fairly cheap.

With a P/E ratio of 11 (ttm) it's among the cheapest entertainment/electronics stocks on the market. Forward P/E is higher, but still is pretty low at 17. Worth noting that they're usually quite conservative their guidance.

With a neutral to bearish DCF analysis the intrinsic value of their stock is about $105. That's just what you get when using last year's earnings as base year, plugging in 0% revenue growth forever and 10% net profit margin forever, 7% discount rate and taking into account their $20B in net cash on the balance sheet.

If Sony is just able to grow their music business, gaming and image sensor business at average market growth rate then that should give Sony a significantly higher DCF valuation already.

>I’d go with Microsoft as they are more diversified than Sony.

You can't really go wrong with Microsoft, it's hard to think of companies in its segment that have a stronger moat than Microsoft. But from a valuation point of view, Sony is without a doubt a much more attractive stock imho. If you attribute less importance to valuation and more importance to the long-term robustness & profitability of the business and the moat, then i'd say Microsoft is a better & safer investment imho. Not really sure why you brought specifically Microsoft into this comparison as they're completely different businesses though.

Sony is also very broadly diversified considering it's a conglomerate consisting of several core businesses: image sensors, gaming, music, movies/TV, electronics and insurance. That's some very broad diversification and it has a strong moat in image sensors, music and gaming.",Audacimmus,1,/r/stocks/comments/nejxut/which_of_the_companies_would_you_choose_for_long/gyhjdxl/,0.021,0.801,0.178,0.9946

281,DD," Some tips first:
1. Time in the market is better than timing the market. 
2. Never trust anyone else with your money. So your own DD.

That said, i have come across several folks who invested an year ago and are in the red. So I doubt if you really missed out on anything. There is never a good time. Just get in, diversify your investments, DCA if you can and hang in there for the long term 5/10/20/30 years and you WILL make money. 

It does sound like you don’t have the appetite for risk that comes with investing in individual stocks, so ETFs are your friends. 

Suggest you start with VOO/VTI, VXUS, SCHD.

Want to diversify? Look at these ETFs: 
XLF (Finance), XLI (Industrial), XLY (Consumer Staples), XLE (Energy), VNQ (Real Estate), XLB (Materials), XME (Metals and Mining).

290,ENPH," Did you listen to their Q1 reports? It was concerning. So ENPH ran up to $220 before its historic slide. They did good on revenue and earnings, but the big dark cloud they unloaded on themselves was lowered expectations for growth through 2021. All green energy is getting clobbered by raw material shortages. ENPH announced that they expected lower product and revenue growth through 2021 because they will have restrictions on the production of their microinverters.

The market has absolutely punished them for it, because growth stocks that operate at PE and PS ratios of ENPH has absolutely no room for error otherwise they'll be punished.

I think it'll go back, but you need to wait for it to find its bottom. Q2 earnings may provide more insights whether it'll slide more. 

This isn't a short squeeze or hedge fund attack. This is an aggregate macro factor supply/demand issue.

Ask yourself these 4 questions:

1. What is ENPH's revenue growth rate?

2. What is their PS multiple?

3. How many years in the future is ENPH's growth priced into the current stock?

4. What are competitor multiples?

ENPH was pricing in nearly 4 years of growth into their stock. If you're willing to wait for this chip shortage to end (predicting in about 1-2 years) you could see 100% growth in ENPH price. Thats a good ROI given SPY only grows about 10% a year.

But if you don't have faith that will happen, I would consider reallocating your capital.

301,NCLH," Get a straight edge and put it on the trend line. That's the normal progression for the markets and a lot of stocks, barring a major shift in their fundamentals.

The market is due for another pullback sometime in the next year or so due to rising inflation, ending stimulus, eviction moratorium ending, and a general back to normal from the government dumping money into the economy during COVID... but that's a ways off. Even then, it'll just be another blip before returning to the trend line.

It takes a major recession or something like COVID to tear the market away from that trend line. 

If you're looking for things that haven't recovered yet, try the larger airline and cruise stocks. These are my figurings and I am not a professional financial or psychic anything. My two main plays are UAL and NCLH. I'm betting once international/business/leisure travel gets going again, these two have 100% upside within 12 months, and that's from today's prices.
