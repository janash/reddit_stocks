5,RH," As pissed as I am at robinhood I'm kinda concerned about their user base. 10-15 million users from what I remember, and they have a huge percent of new/young investors that wouldn't be trading if not for robinhood. They weren't the only brokerage to do this, but since they have the highest amount of social media using millennials on their platform and are relatively new to the market, I feel they are getting an unfair amount of heat

They deserve to be put in place but I have gut feeling RH is gonna take a beating while the older guys like TD ameritrade, charles schwab, all the hedge funds, and the millionaires/billionaires that are ACTUALLY to blame are gonna get away with it.

11,IBKR," If you don't want our order sold for order flow, then you should use a direct access broker that routes your orders directly to NSDQ, ARCA, etc.   Pro is execution is fast and you bypass toll takers like citadel.  When I send a BUY limit order to NSDQ it executes immediately or else I see it reflected in level 2 order book. No delays. But you have to pay per share or per trade, and then ECN fee/rebates depending on whether you are removing or adding liquidity to the market.

I believe some of those brokers in your list, e.g. interactive brokers, have the option to pay more go direct access vs their free 'smart' order which could be sold to MMs. For IBKR, you have to switch to Tiered or Fixed plans instead of Free.

19,ALL," I think it's a lot of emotional reaction and misunderstanding right now, sort of like the housing market crash in '07 where no one knows what is going on. It looks bad, but it has to do with: (1) big overleveraged hedge fund (Melvin) crashed (which causes issues for the clearing houses as when you have a massive overleveraged short loss they OWE money to the clearing house - but because the fund is bankrupt the clearing house basically has to eat the loss); and (2) huge moves on the meme stocks have changed clearing house capital requirements for buys on those stocks (due to risk) to go from 2% to 100%, which they have to keep on the books for 3 days. So - every time someone buys GME for $300 the clearing house has to have $300 on the books for 3 days. Usually they would need to keep just $6 for 3 days. But this is a result of the massive (1400%) short term run up on the stocks.

The clearing houses don't have enough capital on the books to meet these requirements. This is a BIG problem BECAUSE if they become insolvent you will stop being able to buy or sell ANYTHING. Like you sell your apple share and get nothing. Also, they are legally required TO DELIVER if you place a buy or sell order. So if it got to this level it wouldn't just affect the meme stocks but ALL of their investors.

Due to this the clearing houses have told the brokers they have to freeze buys (the reason for only buys- they don't have to keep capital for 3 days for sells). This is what we saw with the TD freeze, etrade, and then (the most publicized because it's the biggest) RH. And the traders just move from one platform to the other which then has to freeze as it passes the buck to a new clearing house.

The brokers DO NOT want to do this. Unfortunately due to the ownership relationships it looks stinky and the public thinks it's some massive Wall St collusion.
