0,BB," Since you guys are here, I’ve liquidated all of my assets on Robinhood due to this. Yesterday they sold without my permission all my GME and BB at the market dip. And it wouldn’t let me cancel, so cost me literal thousands of dollars.

But now I have it all in my “buying power” but not transferable money. Can anyone help explain to me what i can do to move that money? And also what’s the consensus on webull?",0.019,0.916,0.065,0.5803

2,AMC," probably a noob question (look at my username, hehe) - but you mentioned that ""Citadel's most loyal sources for order flow (Robinhood, TDA, Webull, and IB) all fell in line and limited trading at least part of the day"" -- what about Fidelity - Fidelity simply did not restrict any trading on GME or AMC, etc. And people have been saying that Fidelity/Vanguard have their own clearing houses but this seems to suggest that Fidelity has Citadel?

5,RH," As pissed as I am at robinhood I'm kinda concerned about their user base. 10-15 million users from what I remember, and they have a huge percent of new/young investors that wouldn't be trading if not for robinhood. They weren't the only brokerage to do this, but since they have the highest amount of social media using millennials on their platform and are relatively new to the market, I feel they are getting an unfair amount of heat

They deserve to be put in place but I have gut feeling RH is gonna take a beating while the older guys like TD ameritrade, charles schwab, all the hedge funds, and the millionaires/billionaires that are ACTUALLY to blame are gonna get away with it. People will forget this happened and things will go back to the way they were before only without that huge portion of tech savvy investors talking about the problems on social media

Robinhood is not the problem, they're a symptom of a much bigger issue that isn't going to be dealt with",0.105,0.829,0.066,-0.8505

11,AMC,  I hate to have to say it but i cant HOLD anymore. Im not talking about my precious Dogecoins which are gonna rocketship. Im talking about my GME and AMC.

16,TDA, Check with customer support on other brokerages. I opened a Roth IRA with TDA before this and saw they would reimburse the transfer fee with proof after it was complete. Wouldn't doubt others would do the same.,0.0,0.873,0.127,0.5873
17,A, Really weird. What sort of agreement do they have in place that they're still sending more than 40% of orders through Citadel in that report? A flat price contract they can legally claim isn't payment for order flow? All of their orders are being sent to hedge funds but they aren't being paid... that's really odd.

18,RH," I already use Vanguard for retirement funds.  Hadn't thought about them for standard brokerage.  Vanguard is great in customer service for sure.  App for IRA is a little lacking, but not bad.  Overall I'm happy there.  Maybe I need to look at them based on the above list.  Was thinking of moving RH to Charles Schwab where I have a small account.",0.0,0.803,0.197,0.919
