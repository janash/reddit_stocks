4,ALL," Or maybe both are overvalued?  When your ""N"", i.e. sample size is 2 players then I don't think any meaningful comparisons can be made.  Do you know other companies that have P/S of 600x and had CAGR of even 10% over the next 10 years?  That would be a better way of analyzing it.  Let me know as I would be curious.  

I did a quick screener out of curiosity and found 67 TOTAL stocks out of 4000+ stock out of the major exchanges that had a P/S higher then AITX (600x+).  That is about 1.5% of ALL stocks on major exchanges with that high of a P/S.  Most of those are biotech which makes sense as they don't have sales at all due to being in the research/ approval phase.  So if you took those out my guess AITX would be in the highest 99.5% (that is 3+ standard deviations) of ALL traded stocks if compared to major exchanges.  I chose major exchanges as there are more eyes (analysts/ professional money) to judge a more reasonable P part of the P/S ratio vs. just retail folks guessing in the OTC market.  

I don't think one can argue this a VERY expensive priced stock at current value.",10xwannabe,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/nompyn/aitx_10k_released_some_highlights_and_insights/h01f7sk/,0.021,0.924,0.054,0.7716

6,GOED," Yes.  I had some constructive back and forth discussion when this was posted when it all went down last week on another thread.  I find the price action of this WHOLE thing curious!  I have never seen this happen before and was/ am looking for other opinions. 

On that thread I guessed at the current price at that tiem of $1.80's and offering of $2.25 for 1 share+ 1 warrant the future warrant price should be around around 40's.  So take it in the future one day when the GOED warrants traded (Friday) and guess what the warrants ended trading at 0.44c.  So it seems the market is pretty efficiently priced!  So looks like all has been figured out CURRENT, but I do agree I am so curious on the price action on that fateful day.  Did not realize the volume was that high compared to the usual.  So, it must have been a group of traders getting together to boost the stock early cause FOMO and trade out ASAP.  The issue with that is EVERYONE should have already knew the offering was on the table this upcoming week AND warrants were going to trade on Friday so why in the world did folks buy into the FOMO?  If anything those long term holders should have taken it as an early Christmas present and should have been selling like mad, book a large profit, then just rebuy after offering.  Or maybe it was random traders just buying into the fast price movement without doing an DD?  Curious if it was day traders who got burned and NOT long term GOED stock investors?

Would love to hear some feedback from GOED long term investors if there are any on this board for their insight to that ""eventful"" day.",10xwannabe,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/nopnhg/pump_and_dump_mystery_1847_goedeker_goed/h01jts2/,0.014,0.87,0.116,0.9837
