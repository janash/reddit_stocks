8,GM," They cannot possibly make the salton sea any worse than it already is. It was created by an accident where an irrigation pipe leaked for 2 years before they figured out how to stop it. It is an area where water only evaporates that nature deemed unfit for a sea, so it became so salty that the fish that people put into it as part of a tourism boom all died and the tourists left. Then runoff from agriculture also made it toxic rather than just salty.

It is basically a cesspool. If anything, GM might make it better by draining the water out of it to help nature’s cleanup process. The locals would likely hate that because they want to resurrect their tourism industry, but nature is already draining it, as water simply is not supposed to be there.",ryao,6,/r/stocks/comments/omlkm7/gm_has_signed_an_agreement_to_extract_lithium/h5nzucz/,0.083,0.872,0.045,-0.6757

What I do not get is why people are so bullish on GameStop given its business model.

 I see physical sales of games and associated products as yesteryears business model and see little upside with the physical store model; in terms of the mainstream market. This is irrespective of the financial position of GameStop and the other ""drama"" wherever that ends.

I have not nor anyone I know bought physical games in ages, though I am primarily a PC gamer and it could be different on console though those I know that play on console predominantly buy digital, and the convenience of a download or online physical order outweighs other aspects. Nor do I need or care for the added services a company such as GameStop could provide; many could also be provided by an online retailer.

Buying games and accessories in a physical store is to me a niche market that left the mainstream a decade or so ago. Along side bookstores and so forth.

276,GE," One reason is that they aren’t static indexes. They are dynamic survivor bias indexes. What does that mean? 

It means they replace losers with winners. Go look at the Dow or S&P components from 1980 and see how the castoffs have fared. 

For the Dow, changes used to be VERY rare. From 1959-1976 there were ZERO changes. 

Now? It changes its components several times
a year. 

If it didn’t keep doing this, it wouldn’t “perform”
Nearly as well.

Look at how shitty GE has done over the past three years. They used to be THE corporate bellwether of the US economy. But GE’s plunge didn’t hurt the Dow at all. It was removed as a component in the middle of 2018. 

In March of 2015 the Dow added Apple to replace AT&T (once so big and fearful it had to be busted up by regulators, but is now a dogshit dividend stock). That one change alone did wonders for the Dow average. 

In Sept 2013, Nike, Goldman Sachs, and Visa replaced such dogs as Hewlett-Packard and Alcoa.

In 2009, Cisco Systems replaced GM.

Anyways, you get the point. The Dow and S&P, by definition, will always go up over time. They will simply drop dog sticks with no future and replace them with up and coming stalwarts. 

I’ve often looked, but have never found, a report that would show how the Dow and S&P would have performed if they didn’t modify their components and always stack the decks. 

TLDR: the Dow and S&P change the component stocks to always contain far more winners than losers. They will rise over time. They don’t reflect the more broad stock market as a whole, nor do they reflect how the average American family is doing economically. They just reflect a basket of “winning” stocks.",Chippopotanuse,31,/r/stocks/comments/omi8zn/list_of_industries_tanking_right_now/h5md3jc/,0.087,0.878,0.035,-0.9559

318,KO," Reading through the comments.

Let's say you own single share of Coca Cola. They'll give you dividends, meaning, they pay you for owning the share and you'll get it as cash in your broker account. You don't need to sell anything to get it.

at Monday you have 1 share of KO, and on Wednesday, you'll have 1 share of KO and \~0.42 usd in your account. (or however many the dividend is).

  
As for the monthly buy. A previous commentor have stated that's called DCA. It's advantage is that you'll be naturally following the market buying. You'll buy high, but also buy low. If you're fixed on let's say \~100 usd / month, you'll naturally buy fewer shares when it's a lot of money, and more when it's less money.

I recommend the youtube channel [Dividend Data](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ5V5HyAvkFrjsWkANqXscQ) and r/dividends. What i do is pick a stock that i like and buy them every month. Well i don't have a lot of money (intern job), so i chose what to buy, but i roughly DCA into 3 stocks :)

335,ALL," Here's the real truth. Stock Market advice is pretty much worthless. Straight up.

Let me explain... So, somebody can give some sage advice like ""Buy low, sell high"".  The truth is, even advice like this, can both make people money, and cost people potential fortunes. I can guarantee you, that there are people that are incredibly wealthy from IGNORING advice like ""Buy low, sell high"". 

Why? Because they're buying high, and selling HIGHER. When you give somebody the advice to ""Buy low, sell high"", you're teaching them to try to find stocks that have been oversold, but the thing about that, is that most stocks end up that way for legitimate reasons. Sure, there are always going to be certain stocks that get way oversold and then bounce back to where they should have been all along, and you can make some great money with that, but there's also plenty that are going to continue their downward trend. You end up buying falling knives. Also, tons of people are scared to death of buying stocks that have gone on great runs, but sometimes those runs continue and continue, and every time you're on the sidelines saying... ""NVDA's too overvalued, there's no way I can buy that"", somebody else is making a KILLING doing exactly that.

Ultimately the point that I'm trying to make is that ALL stock advice is completely worthless, because there's always going to be somebody that made a fortune from completely ignoring said advice, and there's always going to be people in the poorhouse from treating the advice as Holy Gospel. Thus... it's all worthless.

Forget about all the advice out there, and just try to get educated on facts. Learn how to read balance sheets and financial statements. Learn about supply and demand and finance and interest rates, and bond yields, etc, etc. Just get more facts in your head, ""legit facts"", and then let that information influence your natural instincts.",Anth916,12,/r/stocks/comments/omqu0t/investment_strategy_help_for_younger_investors/h5n40zy/,0.122,0.773,0.105,-0.8478

354,AMC," You’ll find that there’s an emotions chart out there that shows what happens to your emotions as a stock moves up and down. These emotions drive the market literally.

You see everyone is super hype, this is only going one way and that’s up! Then that means it’s probably near the top and it’s time to sell.

356,IMO," This is a fabulous question, and IMO the responses are solid. I will throw in my two cents. Humans aren’t robots, so emotions are inevitable. “Trading without emotion” first involves sufficient self-awareness to recognize emotion in-the-moment and the decision the emotion is pulling you toward. Then step back from that (might take a while, might be quick, just depends) and analyze the pros and cons of that decision, and whether the decision is actually tied to data. You might then still make the same decision, or you might alter it. But whatever you did, it will have been with a clear head rather than reactive. Some people develop a system where the exit is planned once the entry is made. This can definitely help if fast decisions are needed (day trading, or very short swings).

359,IMO," You could develep very rigid rules for yourself on when to buy and sell. Those rules have to be strict and able to force yourself past your personal judgement. But, IMO, a better way is to seek out in research what we call ""negative cases,"" i.e. focus on all the reasons why your stock could fail. Actively seek out better opportunities. Look for stocks that have proven your strategy wrong and figure out why. If you can't find anything, you're probably doing right. But oftentimes we learn more from these negative cases than we do from winning all the time.

392,BAC," There’s a few separate things to answer here.

1) You should invest your disposable income. Make sure you have enough money in your checking/savings accounts to comfortably cover your cost of living (which includes IVF), and invest the rest. $32K - $18K = $14K - if that’s more cushion than you need, consider investing some of it.

2) Having your entire stock portfolio composed of a single stock is not ideal. The best approach for casual investors (such as yourself) is to spread their money evenly across the entire market, which mitigates risk and is pretty much guaranteed to go up in the long run. The way I would suggest doing this is to purchase the stock ticker VOO, which is Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF. So I’d sell all your BAC and instead hold VOO.

3) You will owe capital gains taxes when you sell BAC, which is 15% * the profit you made. The profit you made depends on the share price when it was purchased, which could be nothing if purchased in 1998 when the price was the same as today, or a lot if purchased in the early 90s when it was lower. Regardless of how much capital gains tax you owe, it’s still beneficial to sell / buy an index fund / ETF like VOO. Just make sure to hold some of the proceeds for when you file your 2021 taxes.",ner_deeznuts,1,/r/stocks/comments/omwvl4/eli5_bac_stock_what_to_do/h5nxxiy/,0.042,0.836,0.122,0.9528

397,AMZN," Shares are ownership of a company, they are a ""ticket"" that you pay in order to be an owner. For retail investors you can definitely argue that ownership is useless, you don't affect the company in any way so the value you get from a single share (excluding dividends and resale value) is 0. It's like paying a ticket for an amusement park that doesn't let you on any ride, clearly that ticket is worthless.

However, those who have a significant number of shares (like Bezos with his 50M+ AMZN shares) definitely get a lot of value from ownership, because they get to take decisions that actually affect the company.

Saying that a share of AMZN is worth $3500 is equivalent to saying that the price of a ""ticket"" for being as influential as Bezos is $180B. You may think that $180B is too cheap/expensive for that level of power, but you will definitely agree that it makes sense for that ticket to be worth more than zero, and necessarily, a fraction of that ticket (however small it may be) must be worth more than zero.

415,IMO," Because you can make more and keep more of your money investing in etfs. Over 95% of mutual funds do not beat the market y/y. Even fewer do it consistently y/y. Not to mention the tax implications. You get taxed more when you first bought that and I do believe even in Roth’s you get taxed in different ways holding mutual funds. IMO and many others, mutual funds are a waste of money. If you want a basket of stocks it is better to go with an index/etf. For more info read any book on investing.
