Was able to pull gains out throughout the year and gave me a portfolio to really make a dent (also was early on GME). Anyway my point to commenting is that last years recovery was very fast, it was indeed the V recovery people were touting, that event will not happen again during this covid period. We are correcting on Gmeillionaire speculation and honestly the past two weeks have been good for the market overall and I've acknowledged that. Plus if you had plays in things like BP/XOM/NCLH/RCL/AAL and many more then you've probably kept up with new gains pairing a loss on some of the others.

I'm thinking that banking sector could still run. The financial sector is up almost 30% in the past 3 months:

https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=etf&st=w13

You can see XLF and KRE are up 17% and 35% respectively. I think this is partly due to Biden administration being favourable to banks, but also reliable stimulus and increasing bond yield prices/interest rates.

Traditional energy is back on the rise, which could be bad news for green energy. I still believe that ICLN and individual stocks like ENPH, MAXN, are still winners in the long term. But they may see a similar depression that we saw back in the early 2010's where they just traded sideways for years.

Gold and precious metals are hammered.

DIS may be a big winner, but its hard to see whether all teh reopening benefits are already priced in. DIS is up 25% in the past 3 months, and with parks reopening and DIS+ firing on all cylinders, its hard for me to see the mouse slowing down.

Almost all farming is up huge in the past 3 months. I had AGCO but sold it in July to move into tech. Funny thing is I never went back, but I should have as TEX, AGCO, OSK, CAT and DE are all up almost 30% since December. I think reopening will drive up more demand for agriculture as more people will be back in restaurants and eating out. Again, maybe this is all priced in again?

There’s a good chance a lot of people who are newer bought into tech stocks at all-time highs thinking the 2020 bull run would continue exponentially. Due to a lack of experience of the stock market and/or over-leveraging themselves, they’re likely worried about the losses they’ve seen since buying at highs.

This guy covers it all but the only real way to learn is to do it IMO. 

Safest way? Here's what I did. Find something trading sideways and that is stable, HomeDepot, Emerson Electric, etc. Buy one call option (out of the money) at a price 0.05 - 0.15 cents per contract, don't pay any more. That's literally just $5-15 max. People may say that's silly to throw away money, you're not just look at it as the cost of your tuition to learn. 

Then, find some stock that is cheap, $1-5 stock price. Buy 100 shares. Again, that's $100-500 of your capital but it's for learning and you are not losing it, price is not likely to tank. HLX is not bad, maybe SIRI, NOK, Dennison Mines, anything works just something cheap. 
Now you can ""sell to open"" a brand new call option, called a covered call (covered because you own the shares). 

First method you were a buyer, now you're a seller. So you'll see both sides of it. In the first you pay premium, in the second you collect it (100% yours to keep, no matter what). Keep in mind if the contract you sell is ITM the buyer can choose to exercise, hence why you need to have the 100 shares. So this way you either a) collect the premium and contract expires. That's it you're done keep the money. Or b) you just cap your max gains to strike price minus price you paid times 100, plus premium you collect. Safe way to make income. 

For taxes you can import into Turbo, just mind that it's taxed as short term capital gains (higher rate). 

Just don't use options to gamble, no short term weeklies, etc. Don't go down that black hole it's pure gambling and you will 100% get wiped. But options to reduce your cost average via covered calls?

It took YEARS to get back to those lofty pre tech bubble valuations (over 10 yr)  
Yes, they felt very frustrated for a decade (if they held through it all) which I'm sure most DID NOT.. Not to mention the HUNDRESDS of loft valued STOCKS before the TECH BUBBLE that are no longer in existence and where people lost everything. 

My point is simple those lofty valuations were not warranted in most cases and in the companies that survived it took years to get back to those price levels again. They were saying the same thing then that ""The valuations don't apply to the investment world of today."" and they found out that as history tells you YES IT DOES.

83,USA," Out of the whole canadian weed stock fiasco Canopy Growth is basically the only “winner” though. Look at their chart and tell me if you think thats an actual winner? Factor in opportunity cost of not putting the money anywhere else and its clear that weed stocks are nothing more than a massive gamble on where and how to time the market. Its possible to make money, but its basically roulette for the stock pick and timing the market to sell at a profit

All im saying is that i dont see it as the longterm cash cow most people that talk about it here seem to think it is. Its a glorified pump and dump

If theres any money to be made in the cannabis industry its not in the production and sale of cannabis but rather commodities that go alongside it like bongs/paraphernalia. If i were to make a position in the weed industry, which I probably wont, it would be in a company akin to High Tide, not a company that grows and sells weed

Thats just my 2 cents though, all the power to folks who can make some dough on weed stocks, im just saying that canada is a good case study as to a potential pathway for USA legalization to go",CorruptionOfTheMind,4,/r/stocks/comments/m043o7/advice_literally_the_only_times_i_have_made_large/gq6grpg/,0.025,0.871,0.104,0.9497

I've said it before here, but the US desperately need a wealth tax on the people and companies making just obscene revenue (billions of dollars) while their employees at minimum wage can't earn enough to afford rent.

Here's an idea for one such way to do this: Have each county be given a livable wage standard, and if a family makes under that then they should be given subsidized income to raise them to the standard. After that, take what that program cost at a national level and then tax all companies/corporations within the wealth tax bracket an amount proportioned to what they made over that bracket entry line + interest to grow other social programs. This way you and I don't see our taxes increased, our neighbors get the help they need, and these insane mega-corporations can be held responsible for what this modern era of uncapped capitalism is creating. This requires closing a lot of loopholes and won't be easy, but this is just one way of addressing this.

I believe Apple will continue to beat the market for many years to come. But I think other, younger stocks will beat the market by a whole lot more. Second, your argument doesn’t quite account for magnitude. To put things in perspective, Apples market cap is more than Canada’s annual GDP. For Apple to 10x, it would hit the US annual GDP.

China can, and will, crush companies that dare to interfere with the state. That’s why it’s “undervalued”.",BuffettsBrokeBro,1,/r/stocks/comments/m026si/any_great_buys_during_the_dip/gq7blp1/,0.052,0.905,0.044,-0.1779

373,AI," I also posted most of the following in another thread, but thought it may be useful here:

This DD is so generic it applies to almost any EV maker in China (apart from maybe the BaaS part), yet no one is talking about these companies here.

NIO is not dominating the Chinese market as TESLA does the US market, nor is it likely to. It sold 43,738 EVs in 2020, making it only the 8th largest EV manufacturer in China, trailing Tesla, Wuling, BYD, SAIC, GAC, Great Wall and Chery. Now that's not bad for a start-up. Dozens of new EV makers sprang up in China in recent years, most have gone bust. NIO is among the few serious contenders and I’m sure it will survive, its sales may even go up. I am just not convinced that it is well-positioned to maintain its edge in the segment:

(1) NIO fills a particular niche: If you do not have a licence to buy petrol cars (e.g. in Beijing) but need a large SUV, then until recently NIO ES8 and ES6 were your only options. My high school mate bought an ES8 in 2018 for that reason, but he said he would either downgrade to Tesla Model Y or upgrade to Jaguar I-PACE/Mercedes EQC if he were in the market in 2021. 

NIO's appeal remains in the metropolitan upper middle class. Unlike Tesla, it does not have a budget offering. Tesla Model 3 retails for US$38,324 in China, the cheapest NIO, the EC6, starts at US$54,206, the ES8 is close to US$70,000. NIO also seems to be upholding the 'premium' image. They just released a BMW 7 series competitor (EP7), now seriously, how many people are going to buy it? As premium brands start to get serious with EV, competition in this segment is going to be brutal. Other Chinese carmakers are also going upmarket (e.g. Geely's Lynk & CO., Great Wall's WEY brand). NIO is going to feel the squeeze, from both above and below. It will have a hard time just to hold it's current position. If they continue their current strategy they are going to miss the budget segment, where most of the sales are. The premium market is just not big enough to warrant its current valuation.

(2) A lot of hype is built on paid-marketing materials. I wish people had the chance to actually test-drive their cars. I test-drove my friend’s ES8, the handling is horrible, it feels like a hurried and unfinished product. How is it going to be competitive against, say Jaguar I-PACE or Mustang Mark E, if it were ever released in Western markets? Their AI assistant, with over a dozen in-car cameras and mics streaming everything back to NIO is going to a massive privacy concern.

(3) Their ‘charging infrastructure’ remains a joke, even in big cities such as Beijing. They send a petrol-powered truck carrying batteries to charge your vehicle, seriously? Please tell me where I can replace the battery within a matter of minutes, because my school mate, a ES8 owner, really wants to know.

(4) What is NIO's core competitiveness? They do not own factories, do not build batteries, and their technologies are nothing to write home about. Their autonomous driving is far behind Tesla and not that competitive even to other Chinese carmakers.

Is NIO, which produced less than 50,000 cars last year, worth more than GM? Well, this is not even the biggest hype. Evergrande, another new Chinese EV maker, has a market cap of 68 billion USD (530 billion HK$) at the Hong Kong stock exchange, and guess what, they have sold 0, yes, ZERO cars so far.

I can see why people are jumping on the bandwagon and the hype will probably keep going for a while. It’s just that NIO’s long term potential and valuation may not be as rosy as it seems.",nautilus1982,22,/r/stocks/comments/m0h5v5/long_dd_on_nio_and_why_the_dip_has_made_it/gq830b1/,0.039,0.88,0.08,0.9831

395,DD," Thanks for the comment. Firstly, I never once said that Nio was dominated the Chinese market or whatever like Tesla does. Everyone knows that. There’s other players in China for sure, it’s not like america at all. Yeah NIO’s appeal is in the upper middle class, that’s literally their target audience as a business? Sounds like they’re doing a decent job so far to me since that’s their goal. On your point about the ES8, you question it’s sales but you literally have no explanation why? If you’re saying consumers wouldn’t buy that over the BMW, I don’t see BMW penetrating the Chinese market really? I will concede that the premium market does need some growth, especially when NIO’s operating losses haven’t been slimmed down a whole lot. However, I think that NIO’s other ventures like BaaS and the packages stated at the beginning do fill some of that gap. As for the ES8’s handling, I can’t really comment on that because I don’t have first hand experience. But as for your point on privacy concern, welcome to China? Have you heard of Huawei? Pretty sure they’re doing alright. Also I would encourage your friend to retry the ‘joke and slow charging infrastructure’. It’s on record and verified to swap batteries in three minutes? Doesn’t seem slow to me. (4) What is NIO’s core competitiveness? Nio is trying to differentiate themselves from other Chinese EV’s and not just be the next Tesla or whatever. Tesla had very solid brand recognition and their own style, and Nio knows this. So instead of trying to dethrone musk like other EV companies waste money doing, Nio is trying to carve their own market with the BaaS and premium/upper middle class/ consumer relations. I would swing back around to the strategy part of the DD. Also again I have to concede because you make a really fair point about GM, the valuation there is a little fuzzy. But to get in this kind of EV market, there is undoubtedly a premium, that’s just how it’s turned out to be. You seem to be a fan of Tesla, they’d be an example of how the EV market has a premium.

Doesn’t seem slow to me. (4) What is NIO’s core competitiveness? Nio is trying to differentiate themselves from other Chinese EV’s and not just be the next Tesla or whatever. Tesla had very solid brand recognition and their own style, and Nio knows this. So instead of trying to dethrone musk like other EV companies waste money doing, Nio is trying to carve their own market with the BaaS and premium/upper middle class/ consumer relations. I would swing back around to the strategy part of the DD. Also again I have to concede because you make a really fair point about GM, the valuation there is a little fuzzy. But to get in this kind of EV market, there is undoubtedly a premium, that’s just how it’s turned out to be. You seem to be a fan of Tesla, they’d be an example of how the EV market has a premium.

406,NIO," Young people like NIO for the hype, I agree. Growth opportunity? When NIO has half the market cap of Volkswagen, I’d say growth is abundantly priced in already!

There is a reason no one else is doing battery swapping: it’s expensive to manage and it will eventually (probably soon) be made obsolete. It’s a nice idea, as I said, but little value long term. They will likely become a drag on revenue and get quietly shut down.

Analyst price targets matter little. If you could make money simply following price targets, everyone would be rich with no effort! But while analysts estimates may sometimes predict or even move the price of a stock, other times they just chase it.
I mentioned VW target to show how NIO is not the only company to have high price targets, yet it gets all the hype. That should raise a concern that NIO is not special, just hyped.

Cant speak for the Chinese, but in Europe and America I don’t see them selling many cars.

590,IMO," Some things can be reasonably predicted, though timing is often about luck.

If COVID is defeated, the travel industry will recover. I have been holding airlines for many months for this reason.
Boeing will eventually go back to 300$, barring unexpected developments. When? Hard to say, but I’m holding it because there is plenty potential upside and not much risk IMO at the current valutation. Maybe as early as this summer it will rally.

EV startups are in a bubble, and will crash back in line with the valutation standards of legacy automakers, rather that eternally flying on dreams of unique growth.

Tech was/is going to face a big correction. Gaining 50%+ every year forever is not sustainable.
I expected that once we considered COVID past us - in other words, when the good news has been priced in - markets would see some massive profit taking. Maybe it’s happening now.
My timing was crap in this case, I expected it to happen in a couple months and loaded up on tech just before this nice mini crash. Uh oh. Sold my freshly bought Apple and PayPal and Mercadolibre for a huge loss in just a week, and I’m staying out for now, too much uncertainty.

599,FT," Well, no.
Let’s take the EV bubble for a simple example, it has been called months ago, the only question was when it would pop. If you acted on the headlines you would have been way early, not late.

I didn’t mean that predicting trends is necessarily based on following headlines, either. You can just go by your understanding of the situation.
For example, markets tend to overreact, and sometimes you see a stock drop based on some news that is not really that impactful long term, so you can take advantage of it. Or the classic COVID reopening bet, or the assumption that there is pent up demand from hardcore travelers … you make a guess and act on it, then hopefully the news will confirm it.

But since you mention reading headlines, I want to point I do believe that reading financial news from good sources (think Bloomberg and FT.com, not crap like Motley fool and co.) is very important for education, keeping up to date, and collecting ideas.

Lastly, about the argument that someone is on the other end of a trade, it can be made for any trade and it’s no proof that either side is right.

Yes, at the age of 12 I requested, and received, a copy of Apple's annual report which was also the first edition to be distributed electronically as well (via floppy disk).... and I'll come back to that because it's more relevant than it seems.

Apple is an interesting animal because it seems to follow the Bell Labs model of innovation and you'd probably at first glance think I was insane for comparing them to a dinosaur like AT&T... but the comparison is more apt than you think.

Startups seeking Series n financing lay out a business plan and declare they're going to ""change the paradigm, ""disrupt the market"", or some such Valley buzz speak... and they talk about the end-state product because they have to.  Venture capitalists want to know what the company's bread and butter is going to be.

Apple, however, is a massive, old company with a giant pile of cash... they don't have to beg VC's for money so they don't have to tell you the best bits they're working on until they're really close to releasing them.  How close?  Well, while iPhone has its roots in Alan Kay's Dynabook concept from 1972, public interest started to materialize around a new generation of interfaces when in 2006 Jeff Han from MIT did a demonstration of the capabilities of multitouch capacitive interfaces.

But, here's the thing.... Apple was already using capacitive interfaces a year earlier.

Dubbed the ""Mighty Mouse"", model A1152, had no buttons, just a simple capacitive surface with zones so it could tell whether you were left clicking or right clicking.

Most people derided the Mighty Mouse but four years later the Magic Mouse, using the same technology and ditching the tactile scroll-ball (or nub), became the de-facto Apple mouse and still is.

Apple has been laughed at for USB, Firewire, ethernet, CD-ROM drives, lots of technologies that it introduced to gather real world data on customer sentiment and adoption of various features that would end up making their way into something else and often became a standard...

Quick show of hands... how many people think that the iPod changed the way we get our music?

If you raised your hand (virtually or actually), you'd be wrong.  Initial interest for the iPod were kind of fringe... it didn't really go anywhere until Apple made *getting* music more convenient for the enduser than piracy.  Limewire, Kazaa, Napster all had cluttered interfaces and a hodgepodge of peer-to-peer music without a good way to find what you wanted, or discover new music that you're likely to want.

The real technology that completely disrupted the then 50 year-old distribution model of the recording industry was quietly licensed by Apple from Amazon in 2001, when the iPod came out and three years before iTunes Music Store was released.  It was one-click purchasing.

Which brings us to wearables and AR, stuff that's been around for some time but really sucks in terms of long-term adoption and disruption of the market.  The difference between these wearables is that they don't really build on intuitive uses of technology or interfaces... the iPhone probably gets more use as an ""Internet Communicator"" than anything yet at the time of its introduction you could hear the lack of enthusiasm about that third wheel.

What iPhone really did was accelerate adoption by acclimating a generation of affluent thirty and forty somethings to a device that was really a portable laptop, and they did it in less than a year, and it completely changes the way working professionals AND teens spend the majority of their time... Hell, it completely killed the PDA... all because it put your laptop in your phone.  They didn't drop ""Computer"" from their name because they \*gasp\* were going to stop selling Macs.  They did it because the term ""computer"" isn't sufficient to describe our relatioship with CPU-driven devices any more.

So I really think if they do release these products, they're really just real-world testbeds for particular features or attributes that will find their way into something else that builds upon existing tools and makes AR more than a toy but an indispensable technology.

About that annual report... The disk had the entire annual report on a Hypercard stack.  John Sculley once remarked that among his biggest failures was not understanding what to do with Hypercard.  Hypercard was thought of as a presentation tool, like powerpoint.  But what it really was is the world's first browser... capable of displaying graphics, text, and interlinking different ""pages"" with hypertext... first released in 1985, eight years before NCSA Mosaic—the first web browser.

I’ve been periodically looking at live bid-ask data for GME, and during February’s gamma squeeze I noticed constant buy orders (and some sell orders) for exactly 73 shares.

Lots of 27 share bids this morning and now dozens of orders every minute for 38 and 26, shares, but none for 62 or 74.

806,BGR," Today people are taking profits on energy and commodities so you can use a stock screener to see which stocks and ETFs are doing well.

I just bought some Blackrock energy trust (BGR). It's a ""closed end fund"" etf. The way they work is that they pay out some gains in monthly or quarterly dividends and income, as well as have gains in the underlying assets. So it's doing well in terms of beating other energy ETFs while also paying a dividend. This is important right now because any assets that pay dividends are in high demand. So a closed end fund like BGR will do at least as well as other similar ETFs but also attract investors seeking out dividends right now. As a result, BGR is outperforming XLE and other energy ETFs in terms of share price gains. 

So you might want to check out closed end funds for commodities.

894,AMC," I’m with you on this. I’m pretty new to the market. Started acquiring weed stocks a few years ago mainly because I believe in the industry. 

For me AMC has a good risk VS reward. Holding 525 shares @ $7.72. I’m not so good at DD yet so I just soak in everything I can form a bunch of different sources. For me it basically comes down to this, if It tanks I’ll lose a few grand and it won’t hurt me, if it moons I could make a nice chunk of change. So losing a few grand for the opportunity to moon is worth it to me. If it doesn’t squeeze I still think it’s a good recovery play. So maybe I’ll make out ok down the road. 

I have to say though, this weekend has me confused AF. I was excited it closed over $8. I was excited the hype is ramping up. Was excited with the CEOs interview... then all of the shareholder meeting threads started. Talks about dilution and adding 500mil more shares. So many different angles on that I can’t keep up. 

So I just fell back on why I bought the stock in the first place. It’s not going to hurt me if I lose. It would be awesome if it squoze. If it hits $15 as a recovery play I’ll double my money.

897,AMC," I'm in the minority (or so it seems) in believing that the AMC stock is starkly undervalued. AMCs competitors' stocks are still somehow valued at over double AMC's stock prices, despite the fact that AMC has still had open theaters throughout the pandemic and is the largest theater chain.

The theater business as a whole has taken a major hit during the pandemic and the stock price pre-pandemic was noted to be heavily shorted as well. Whether you've invested for the memes or not, the stock seems to have a potential for growth in the short or longer term (as economy reopens), and even more now that theaters are already opening. 

Me personally, I've been in the game since around May of last year and continue to buy in because I truly believe the industry will bounce back. However, after the initial GME victory, I'm also here for the memes. In my opinion, AMC is the better play than GME as far as long term goes because GME's stock shouldn't be over a few dollars. 

Gamestop's business model needs a massive overhaul in order to survive the current and future climate of gaming. AMC (and other theater chains) also needs to adapt, especially after people have gotten a taste of new movies on demand as a direct result of the pandemic. Adam Aron seems to be putting in the necessary work to ensure AMC can adapt and succeed in the longer term.

929,CEO," PayPal is an excellent stock to add during this pullback. I've picked up shares myself.

The reason the company has dropped so much in price is because of its extremely high valuation. PayPal trades at a very high multiple compared with its actual earnings. And any high-flying tech stock like that has been murdered during this correction.

However, there's a reason PayPal trades at a premium. As much as any company, PayPal is poised to tap into the continued rise of ecommerce and digital payments. Hell, around earnings time, Jim Kramer predicted that PayPal would soon surpass Visa and Mastercard in terms of digital growth. And the PayPal CEO has excellent ideas for how to capture additional revenue through movement into crypto and offering stock trading (Kramer wondered aloud whether PayPal would simply buy Robinhood). PayPal is going to play a humungous role in the future of digital currency. Under $250, the stock is a great buy.

935,RH," I’m new to investing as well, only been in a month, but I’ve learned a lot. I started with $400 in a Robinhood account. That was my first lesson learned, though not until I switched to a different broker. Make sure the broker you choose is a legit and reputable one. Every single trade on RH is done on margin, regardless of being a cash account or not, and they are not up front about this. 

I bought some inexpensive stocks since I didn’t put in a large amount and I wanted to start simple as I was learning.  I bought shares in 4 different companies that all are in the same commodity and that wasn’t wise. They were some mentioned on wall street bets, and I didn’t know what I know now about meme stocks. The stocks were doing ok for about 2 weeks, and I was actually seeing gains and then they slowly started losing. 

After reading some books and researching reliable investment sites,  I realized that I didn’t make the best choices for the companies I chose. I learned how to research companies that I was interested in, or that a reputable publication mentioned. I learned to look at the charts for every year, not just how they were currently performing. I learned to look at news articles about  companies and all of the data that goes into a stock and it’s performance. It is a lot of info and I don’t understand all of it but I get the important things. 

I’ve also learned that refocusing your portfolio is ok. I sold the overlapping shares and kept one company that was consistently performing. I also sold shares that I had in a company that when I bought, they were $21/s and had over a month dropped to $14/s. I had 10 shares in that company and wanted to cut my losses before they got worse. I used the cash from that to buy shares in two companies that are stable and that I’ve done a lot of research and monitoring.  %). It could be much worse if I hadn’t refocused. 

Now, I’m planning to commit to good, steady companies for the long term. I know I will want to do some speculative purchases from time to time, but after more research and not just jumping on a trend. I also don’t plan on doing any options trading as I would be afraid of losing too much. Yes, there is money to be made there but it’s just not for me no

While doing so, you can start by learning on how to value a stock, what sort of criteria to pick a high growth stock, learn how to do DD about stocks, read up or watch more videos about it.

1017,TSLA," So there is the concept of catching a falling knife and not knowing when is the bottom.  Theoretically now I have allocation percentages where I want something to be a certain percentage of my portfolio so one holding or sector has fallen then I will add to it to rebalance and thus buying the dip.  However if everything is falling then I may not have the ammo to buy all of it.  For me what I have invested is significantly greater than my reserves /new money to buy dips.  A lot of conversations about the lost decade are to show the volatility and that everything doesn't always go up.  

For me personally my worst investment was back in 2000.  I had gotten in early on JDSU which you could consider today's TSLA it was the hot thing that had great prospects and made a lot of people including me a lot of money.  It crashed hard in 2000 and possibly into 2001.  I bought a lot of dips and ended up losing money even though I would have still been up if I had just held firm or sold at the dips considering how early I had gotten in.  Basically it never recovered back to what it was (it is now two different companies).  Buy the dip sounds great but if the dip is not the bottom it can make things worse.",imnotgood42,4,/r/stocks/comments/m0jz9v/why_do_you_people_mention_buying_in_a_certain/gq88s74/,0.069,0.883,0.049,-0.5499
1018,TSLA," JDSU isn’t remotely like TSLA. 

JDS Uniphase was a b2b comms equipment company trading at over 100 price to sales at its peak. 

Tesla is a consumer discretionary goods and transportation company trading at 20 price to sales and growing way faster year over year in sales than JDSU ever did.

If you correctly identify the 2000 drawdown as not the “dot com” crash but rather a telecommunications crash, you can understand that these two companies aren’t remotely similar. 

For TSLA to be similar, you’d have to assume a similar 90 percent crash in EV sales and spending, similar to what we saw in telecom equipment in that two year period, when businesses essentially slashed Capex dealing a huge blow to the b2b company. 

I have a hard time TSLA will see the same fate, especially as they sell a superior good during a time when the rich have only gotten richer.

Consumer goods are way way easier to track and analyze than b2b goods, which tend to fluctuate wildly due to the supply chain bullwhip effect",AngelaQQ,-1,/r/stocks/comments/m0jz9v/why_do_you_people_mention_buying_in_a_certain/gq8hrqq/,0.066,0.792,0.142,0.9513
1019,ICE," Nothing I said was untrue. 

JDSU’s revenue stream absolutely collapsed, as did the rest of the fiber industry. 

If you think the EV industry is going to collapse the same way, be my guest and short the stock. 

Don’t get salty at all of us who are bullish as hell on EV and taking the opposite side of that bet though.

People betting on optical didn’t expect the resilience of cable broadband. Maybe people betting on EV aren’t expecting the resilience of ICE.  Who knows. That’s why there is risk reward, and perhaps my tolerance for risk is just higher than yours.  No need to be mad though.

As far as the resilience of cable broadband, JDSU was the reason for cable broadband.  Back then the best most people could do was DSL with some cable offering maybe 10mbs if you were lucky.

There are also momentum traders,  they just buy when things go up and sell after they go down some amount.  They are likely selling tech and buying oil or something else that is going up.  

Now that index funds are huge,  any trend just keeps going longer than it used to.   Value stocks should have never gotten so cheap,  but as they got smaller index funds just keep selling (or buying smaller amounts) and tech just got too big.   This reversal may keep going for years unless there are active traders with more dip buying firepower than the index fund and momentum combo.....but... here's the last feedback,  big active funds like to show that they are holding winners and not loses.

1035,ATH," You needed to learn about investing before jumping into the market, try diving into the 1000s of good books on the matter. 

Never invest money you’re going to need within 5 years. The stock market isn’t a money multiplier atm it goes down in the blink of an eye and can go sideways for decades. The perma bears are screaming right now, but honestly they don’t know what will happen tomorrow either. Crashes and bear markets a natural healthy cycle for the market. They’re going to happen whether we want them or not. 

Apple is a great long term hold, even if you bought high. It’s a corporate global monster entering the EV market and has more cash than the US government on hand. 

I’m not trying to be a dick, but you honestly need to learn more about this. Diversification is key to the success long term and you won’t be chasing the crowd, which is how you buy in at ATH. 

As for your personal situation...look in deep at the companies youre invested in. Analyze their financials, products, consumer base, and for the love of god make sure they can service their debt in any economic conditions....I mean rising interest rates btw

\- Another key assumption should be that the final cash flow calculation should have depreciation equal capex because otherwise the asset base grows to infinite (especially since you use the TV using the terminal growth rate).

\- The terminal growth rate is a tad too high (imo) for a mature company like Intel; one suggestion I can give is you can do sensitivity analysis on different growth rates and different WACCs (which I don't know if you calculated or you assumed).

1077,PS," Declaimer: I have money in NUSI.   

How it could go wrong though:   

 - You put too much into NUSI. NUSI will always under-perform the market during bulls, almost by design. Because none of us know when the market will dip (tomorrow, next week, two years from now) if you over-hedge you can make a very measurable loss.      
 - You completely miss the correction/downturn, or enter too soon (see Feb 28, 2020 for a ""fake bottom"").         
 - You're essentially betting the difference between NUSI and VTI/VOO returns. You will eventually be right but if the bear is too far into the future you can still make a *loss*.   
 - NUSI does dip during downturns, just less. So it isn't actually liquid cash. During the March 2020 crash VTI was down 32%~, and NUSI fell 12.5%~ which means your potential ""gain"" in that situation was only 19.5%. However, in 2019 you would have made 21% on VTI and only 7.5% on NUSI, reducing your potential crash upside from 19.5% to somewhere closer to 6%, going negative if that money was held in VTI instead of NUSI for *two* years before crash.   
 - If the crash is less severe you're more likely to miss it and the upside is even lower.   

My point is: Putting money into NUSI is a bet against the market, and you better be right before you're losing more than you gain because at some point you cannot make it back by buying low with a relatively smaller pot.   

PS - I'd aim for 5% in NUSI, and only if you're an active investor who is following the market near daily. If you're asleep at the wheel it will underperform VTI/VOO 100% of the time.",TimeRemove,2,/r/stocks/comments/m047xn/holding_dry_powder_in_nusi/gq66ir7/,0.131,0.829,0.04,-0.976

1109,AMZN," Just keep in mind this portfolio will be heavily biased in Tech and heavily biased in growth companies that will be more volatile. You will do better some years, but be more exposed during downturns. You will be downplaying many industrial, financials, healthcare etc...

Look at the top 20-30 holdings in VOO, QQQ, and some of the ARK funds and you will see a great deal of overlap, so if you want to add diversity you need to be conscious of what you're overlapping and what isn't.

Some brokerage firms have a view that will show you how exposed you are to a single stock, including the percentage of holdings in an ETF. You will be heavily exposed to APPL, TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, and GOOG.

Most of you're exposure to Mid-caps will be a few volatile companies held in ARK funds.

I also would forgo VOO and choose a mix between VOOG and VOOV (or SPYG and SPYV). You can balance more funds in VOOV when you think some of the growth funds are going through a period when they are bubbling and you can balance towards growth when you feel there are years of growth ahead.

Check into Mid-cap ETF, both Value and Growth. The Russell 2000 or S&P 400 indexes would be a good palce to start. There are times Mid-caps so better or worse than the large-caps. This should be a smaller portion of you portfolio <10%, but it should balanced within that 10%.

One last thing, value funds do better over time than many realize. The key thing is you have to turn dividend reinvestment on in your brokerage account. You also have to look at calculations of 'cumulative investment return' vs. 'unrealized gains' to see it.

What happens in dividend reinvestments is it will dilute your unrealized gains percentage as your recent dividends reinvestments have little changed from their purchase prices. Also your gains through dividends won't be included in your unrealized gains. So one such value fund I'm in has unrealized gains of 30%, but my cumulative investment return is 90%.

1116,AM,"  IF you have a ton of dough, you can get and IPO on the offering price from the brokerage that is the lead underwriter.

IPO business is known as Syndicate. The syndicate is headed by a lead underwriter (ie. lead brokerage firm handling the offering.) Also in that syndicate are what are called selling group firms.

The lead underwriter gets the bulk of the IPO stock and the selling group firms get less. An issuing company will tell the lead underwriter how much goes to institutional investors and how much goes to retail (peons like me and you,) There are reasons why a company might want more or less retail investors.

If you have full service accounts around the street you might snag shares on the actual offering but IPO shares are considered ""favors"" that are given to their biggest clients.

At one point I was the syndicate coordinator for my office. Advisors would give me their indications of interest (how many shares they wanted for all their clients.) We almost never were given all we wanted so I would take the bulk of them for my clients and parcel out some to the rest of the office.

Only full service accounts get shares. They don't give them out to discount online accounts.

If you are unable to get IPO offering shares, you are going to have to buy them when trading begins. In most cases, you might see the first trades around 10:00 AM or maybe later. Typically, during the period before the actual IPO, the lead underwriter tries to match up the IPO price so that it pops about 10% when the stock opens. That is why these are considered favors for the clients that get them in the IPO. Most of the time they get it right, but sometimes they don't and stocks skyrocket. Whatever you do, use a limit order as the opening may be way above the IPO offering price.

As underwriter, the firm will support the IPO price for a few days up to about a week. That means they will buy shares below the the offering price to support the IPO. If the stock pops, they don't have to do that. You can consider the IPO price the floor, so if you can get shares either from the IPO offering or on the exchange when the stocks starts trading, you can feel fairly confident your downside is limited. All bets are off though if the price is way above the IPO price.

1117,ABNB," Wow. Thank you so much for that writeup. Really detailed and I appreciate the time you took to write it. Helps a ton.

So I'm currently interested in investing in Roblox. We saw a few months ago many IPOs go crazy above their initial IPO price (right? I'm correct in saying that with ABNB and a few others).

From what I can tell, Roblox seems priced around $45? I understand you are not a financial advisor and there are also many factors that go into this - but in your opinion - if I liked Roblox - what seems like a good limit order to place?",JamonRuffles17,1,/r/stocks/comments/m0gf1k/how_to_get_into_ipos/gq8c6gh/,0.016,0.787,0.197,0.9556
1118,ABNB," Great, thanks a lot.

One last question - as I mentioned, some like ABNB had some madness behind them. Constantly changing the offering price and then even that skyrocketed. 

I find it difficult to judge what is fair if for example it shoots up double, etc",JamonRuffles17,1,/r/stocks/comments/m0gf1k/how_to_get_into_ipos/gq8hz65/,0.102,0.677,0.222,0.7506
