This is becoming a game of mind and time by now, however, I’m a Believer/Man of Faith!

All our DD since 12/2020 can not be all wrong;

ATOS managed to have 3 direct offering within 3/4 months, which is unheard of;

ATOS halted a critical P2 of Endoxifen for Breast Cancer about a year earlier, which is also very exceptional;

ATOS asked for extra 325 Mil AS (vs existing 123 Mil) which showed how good they felt about P2 Data of Endoxifen, and this was also kind confirmed by the way Dr. Quay talked about ""having a nice P2 package to talk to big Pharm ..."" in the Presentation at the Investor Summit Conference on 05/18/2021;

All the smart money behind 06/21 and 07/16 calls and the 10 HFs (each invested $5 Mil for off PPS at $2.88 in late 03/2021) are controlled by some very smart and greedy pro in investment, I would not believe that they could be fooled by anyone!

On 05/19, all 6 ATOS employees exercised all their available options at $2.90, Dr Quay - 1.90 Mil SH, Kyle - 0.85 Mil SH, others - 50,000 SH;

The fact that Dr Quay brought back Dr Chen (10% owner of ATOS in 2009) recently as a Dir of ATOS is definitely a good sign too. They might even be married by now. A smart scientist like Dr Quay would never bring someone that important to him into a embarrassment in case P2 of Endoxifen is not good!

Also, since ATOS is not going to present the P2 Data at ASCO this year (06/04 - 06/08, the only reason could be under quiet period for a BO/Partnership), this led me to believe that the probability of a BO/Partnership is 95%+.

18,ATOS," Definitionally, bubbles pop and never return to their bubble high.  People once spent as much as the value of a house for a tulip bulb, and those prices have never returned.  That's a true bubble.  Bubbles never return, that's how bubbles work.

Before you say 'what about the 1929 stock market, or the tech bubble, or housing etc.'; their return is caused by the expansion of the money supply, or other factors that make them apples to oranges.  For example, the companies that make up the 2021 DJIA are completely different from the companies that made it up in 1929.  This shift has happend to a lesser degree since 2000 as well.  Also, if tech was priced in 2000 dollars, or housing was priced in 2008 dollars, the 2021 value would be substantially less.

That being said, the price action in ATOS, as well as many stocks these days are feeling the effects of the same monetary expansion due to COVID relief.
