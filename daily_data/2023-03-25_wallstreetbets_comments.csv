7,LOW," They won‚Äôt. If they will, it will be the day after these expire worthless. We‚Äôve all been there. 

Never try and time a short term crash. 

The odds are nearly impossible, especially if everyone is thinking the same thing.

Big $$$$$ trading is made in calls on Vs based on VIX. Sell offs not easy to predict. Buying much easier to predict. Market IS rigged. 

Bigger $$$$$ just buys and hold assets. 

Crashes way easier when VIX is LOW. High VIX, it is hard to keep crashing 95% of the time. 

Crashes should be much farther out of a prediction. You‚Äôd be surprised how long it takes markets to crash. Even Burry is year + out. And his bearish positions $ aren‚Äôt even close to his bullish positions $$$$$$. 

For the 2 rich bears there are 20 million rich bulls. 

The V always happens. Bigger the drop the bigger the V. 

If you think crash is about to happen in the next 48 hours, just wait and play the V up. 

Learn SPY and VIX and BUYING not predicting selling and you will do better.",jiblitt,38,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1218ehm/down_87hoping_the_banks_fall_apart_over_the/jdl1qvd/,0.109,0.786,0.106,0.1182

53,AIG," It will come from the bank who sold the swaps, and yes, that bank will sell swaps because they don‚Äôt think the company will default. The idea was invented by JPM when they had lent a huge amount of money to XOM. They were worried about XOM because of an oil spill and wanted to shore up their balance sheet by swapping that risk with someone else. So they found a  bank (EBRD)willing to swap the risk of XOM defaulting, and then they freed up cash to lend more money to someone else.

So say I lend out 5B to XOM. if I go to another bank and say hey I‚Äôll give you 250 million dollars a year if you promise to pay me 5B million If XOM defaults within the timeframe of the loan, and the other bank agrees, I can now lend out more money.

And EBRD who thinks XOM will never default is now getting 250 million dollars a year for 5 years for ‚Äúnothing‚Äù.

AIG sold a bunch of CDS in 2007 because they have different reserve requirements than banks. In 2008 they needed a bailout or all those companies who bought swaps from them would default too. So in the JPM example, if XOM defaulted and EBRD couldn‚Äôt pay JPM the 5B back, the EBRD would default, so might JPM if they lent out more than they thought they could before they bought the swaps. 

CDS are also used to structure the risk of CDOs. 

Michael Burry was buying all CDS against CDOs because he was sure the CDOs were junk. He was increasingly frustrated because he saw that banks weren‚Äôt pricing the CDOs CDS correctly even when the CDOs were worthless (when the CDO  looks like it will default, the price of CDS on that CDO will go up) and when the world was falling apart. And the banks weren‚Äôt pricing them correctly because they were trying to get the CDOs off their balance sheets and if the price of the CDS went up too high no one would buy the CDOs.",Bigfat_garce,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1216eei/you_will_be_hearing_about_credit_default_swaps/jdmhytl/,0.063,0.89,0.046,-0.4939

So they found a  bank (EBRD)willing to swap the risk of XOM defaulting, and then they freed up cash to lend more money to someone else.

So say I lend out 5B to XOM. if I go to another bank and say hey I‚Äôll give you 250 million dollars a year if you promise to pay me 5B million If XOM defaults within the timeframe of the loan, and the other bank agrees, I can now lend out more money.

And EBRD who thinks XOM will never default is now getting 250 million dollars a year for 5 years for ‚Äúnothing‚Äù.

AIG sold a bunch of CDS in 2007 because they have different reserve requirements than banks. In 2008 they needed a bailout or all those companies who bought swaps from them would default too. So in the JPM example, if XOM defaulted and EBRD couldn‚Äôt pay JPM the 5B back, the EBRD would default, so might JPM if they lent out more than they thought they could before they bought the swaps. 

CDS are also used to structure the risk of CDOs. 

Michael Burry was buying all CDS against CDOs because he was sure the CDOs were junk. He was increasingly frustrated because he saw that banks weren‚Äôt pricing the CDOs CDS correctly even when the CDOs were worthless (when the CDO  looks like it will default, the price of CDS on that CDO will go up) and when the world was falling apart.

81,EU," These is chat gpt‚Äôs interpretation and thoughts on the posts

This post on Reddit seems to be raising concerns about the stability of the European banking system, particularly in relation to Deutsche Bank, one of the largest and most important banks in the region. The author suggests that Deutsche Bank's price to insure against default is skyrocketing, which could indicate financial trouble for the bank.

Furthermore, the post points out that Germany's three largest banks already hold 97% of banking assets in the country, which could pose a risk to the Euro itself. The author notes that in the US, the three largest banks hold only 35% of banking assets, which could suggest a concentration of power in the European banking sector that is potentially problematic.

The post also raises concerns about the ability of the ECB (European Central Bank) to deal with a potential crisis in the banking sector. The author suggests that the ECB may not have the same resources and power as the Federal Reserve in the US, which could limit its ability to respond effectively to a crisis. Additionally, the author notes that the lack of a centralized power or taxing authority in Europe could make it difficult to address a crisis at the EU level.

In general, the post seems to be highlighting some legitimate concerns about the stability of the European banking system and the potential risks posed by concentration of power in the sector. However, it is important to note that predicting financial crises is notoriously difficult, and it is not clear whether the concerns raised in this post will ultimately be borne out. It is also worth noting that the EU has taken steps in recent years to strengthen its banking sector, including the creation of the European Banking Union, which could help to mitigate some of the risks identified in this post.",Puzzleheaded_Top7459,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/121vtu0/europe_is_fcked/jdo12nf/,0.099,0.826,0.075,-0.9062

88,EU," I think you missed the part where he implies ""printing"" the money might not be an option anymore. We are already seeing the results of excess liquidity. Banks are nominally increasing interest rates.

Here in the US we did NOT print money for the recent round of ""bailouts"". The FED is certainly increasing its balance sheet in the short term, however it is lending cash it already had to banks in exchange for certain ""high quality"" securities (MBS, Treasury, AAA etc).

While this has an inflationary pressure it's not the same as printing. Also TARP in 2008 was NOT printed, it was borrowed which is very, very different. 

The fact is both here, but to a much greater extent in EU, printing means much more severe inflation, currency collapse, and a serious decline in international trade.

On the other hand borrowing costs depend on the perceived ability of governments to tax the principle and interest back from its population. For the Euro, there is no centralized way to do this. Again this likely leads to currency collapse, and decline in international trade, possibly with a severe recession if local governments enact austerity measures. 

It's not really a tinfoil hat conspiracy. It's hard to see many more options existing for many smaller economies if financial sector crisis expands. Here in US we have 4 times the debt we had in the 70s. At a certain point you just can't print or borrow more without alternative severe repercussions.",H0lland0ats,26,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/121vtu0/europe_is_fcked/jdnsows/,0.163,0.744,0.094,-0.9743

For the temperature ranges that the vast majority of people drive in, the range losses are nowhere near that.  Furthermore, the opposite scenario (hot weather) sees EVs outperform gas vehicles that have to use extra gas for the AC.

2.	The U.S. is secretly planning a European Union-style merger with Mexico and Canada 
‚ÄúI saw the YouTube of [former Mexican president] Vincente Fox talking about [the single North American currency] the Amero. So, it‚Äôs not a secret. Now it may not be [here] tomorrow, but it took ‚Äòem 20 or 30 years to get the Euro, and they had to push people kicking and screaming....

4.	Rein in Medicare ‚Äî but not Medicare‚Äôs payments to doctors (presumably including Rand Paul, a practicing optometrist who says half his patients are on Medicare)

""I think whoever owns the property can do with the property as they wish, and if the coal company buys it from a private property owner and they want to do it, fine. The other thing is that I think coal gets a bad name, because apparently a lot of the land is desirable once it gets flattened out...

ChatGPT: It's difficult to determine whether someone is ""smart"" or not based on a single action such as buying a stock. However, it's important to note that buying a stock based solely on a connection to a homework helper (in this case, ChatGPT) may not necessarily be the most informed investment decision.

It's important to conduct thorough research and analysis before making any investment decisions, taking into account factors such as the company's financial health, industry trends, and market conditions.

Overall, the decision to buy a stock ticker AI based on a connection to AI (ChatGPT) may not be the most rational approach to investing, but it's difficult to make a definitive judgment about the individual's level of intelligence based on this action alone.",jeg101586,41,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12132x2/openai_helped_with_homework_so_i_bought_ai_ticker/jdke51u/,0.05,0.868,0.082,0.431

It's inspiring to see how technology and education can come together to help people make informed decisions and achieve financial success. It takes dedication and perseverance to learn about the stock market and make wise investments, and this guy's success is a testament to his hard work and determination.

Will Class A multi suffer?  Only properties that don't have the capital cushion to ride it out.  As you know, thats the key to commercial real estate - cash for ops and debt maintenance to survive tight credit conditions.  But you make a good point about my point being unclear.

215,INTC," this is literally how options are SUPPOSED to be used. 

it should be a hedge bet in the opposite direction of your holdings or short term calls/puts to hedge against your long dated calls/puts.

 for example I have 10 INTC calls for january 2024 exp at strike $25, the last 2 months ive been buying $30 strike puts in INTC dating from march-september. when intc goes down in the short term i profit. if it goes up over my strikes, i lose in the short term but if it reverses back to 2022 highs, then i will profit in the long term.

or you can play the stock market casino and just gamble until you eventually make so much money you dont have to work anymore, or you lose so much money you have to work at wendys.
