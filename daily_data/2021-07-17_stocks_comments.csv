But this disagreement seems to be cultural, I just found right now that the USA sites for these brands and others (like Volvo) all say that they sell ""luxury"" vehicles while the international site doesn't.

It doesn’t have to be a Einstein level play for it to be amazing. It just has to work incredibly well for the company and I’d argue that it did.

If the government wasn’t handing out these incentives to go green, we wouldn’t be seeing all these companies shift their direction to make EVs, for those credits. Only reason Ford is making electric f150s is credits. Only reason GM invested heavily in Lordstown is for those credits.

22,IMO," US economic shutdown is not going to happen again IMO. Mask wearing across the US…maybe.  The government is now making it your job to get vaccinated and protect yourself since the US has widespread vaccine availability even if it’s not as effective against the delta variant because it still provides at least 64% efficacy against infection and about 94% against serious illness and death. Internationally you are right in that many countries cannot keep up with the vaccine effort. This will hurt a lot of industries that are reliant on international supply chains (which we have seen a little of already).

23,PFE," It’s the alt investments that will be the catalyst. I can’t say the word or the bots here will ban me but it rhymes with tiptoe. The entire banking system and people’s wealth is being layered and leveraged and borrowed and staked all on top of assets few of which have any valuation rooted in reality or fundamentals. As it builds it becomes more vulnerable to a major policy shift that can cause the impact underlying valuation to drop, thereby toppling the house of cards set on top of it. It’s the mortgage backed securities playbook all over again. Pair that with a headwind of easy stimulus disappearing and we have our next bubble bursting. I don’t think we are there yet and was happy to see this pullback but by 2023 we will definitely fall of a massive cliff.  On the stock front I’m still bullish as earnings are hitting records, borrowing is cheap and will be even if rates go up 3pts, the consumer has lots of cash to spend, private sector investment and M&A is throwing tons of money into equities and the majority of wealth Mgmt is now going into unmanned ETFs. So my only playbook is to move to longer term investments, steer clear of speculative stocks, have plenty of cash on the sidelines ready to invest, not knee jerk during the 10 small corrections we will get before the big one hits, and stay focused on the bigger picture. 

I can’t see lockdowns happening in the US again and people tolerating it. Plus only the unvaccinated are dying and that pct will continue to shrink. So the hospital systems will be able to handle it this time and the rest of us will just have bad colds from delta. My father who had major health issues and is 75 just got it and was fine in 3 days. He had the PFE vaccine. He was golfing on day 5. 

Another way to look at it is that the US has recovered faster than the rest of the world and this dominance will continue, enabling faster business growth which leads to better earnings which leads to more foreign investors in US stocks which leads to propping up the US market longer. So if I can stick to my own advice and not chase stupid stocks I think I’ll be fine. Of course I may be wrong but betting against the US market will prove wrong much more often.",Swingtrader79,7,/r/stocks/comments/om3rvn/if_market_crashes_due_to_a_restrictions_from_the/h5j9cc1/,0.045,0.817,0.138,0.9904

I can deal with stock bubbles, those happen regularly. but the Dogecoin thing was freaky alarming. Pick your stock bubble, Tesla or Pets dot com or the Nifty Fifty from the 1970s. at least there's an actual company trying to offer an actual product or service. Dogecoin was a literal joke and it was somehow more valuable than Ford Motors, Prudential insurance or Walgreens. that's unprecedented. 

Burry was already partly proved correct. his Bloomberg interview was late 2019 and a few months later the NY Times did an article that pointed out some of the precise things Burry had said. the NY Times didn't mention Burry by name, it's not clear the journalist was aware of what Burry had said. but IMO Burry called it at least in part.

25,IMO," No one said full Weimar.  I'm not familiar with the details of Burry's bear case.  I thought he was just saying the equities market was in a bubble and would correct.  In which case he would just be right in your lockdown scenario...

The inflation case is basically that significant inflation pressure will happen for the first time in 40 years, which would be a shock to the market itself as almost an entire lifetime of investors has gone without experiencing increasing inflation. 

If the market tanks has nothing to do with the inflation prediction, only that under the inflation thesis, current valuations are way too high with way too much premium and not enough required return.  So inflation thesis says there should be inflation correction, especially in certain sectors.  

What you are talking about is a deflationary event though.  And that would depend.  If inflation collapses because of Delta variant, and Fed has to start cutting rates and printing again, then yes, inflation thesis would have been wrong, because of another black swan.  Those that have been saying we are in a permanent forever low interest rate environment would be right.  But those people are not exactly bulls themselves... So I don't think you fully understand the arguments that are being made about this market. But don't feel bad, I don't think most of the market understands and currently it is still pricing based on 2010s mindset, IMO.

29,GDP," All indicators are pointing to sky rocketing inflation in the coming months and potentially years. Janet Yellen herself just came out and stated inflation is likely here to stay for a bit - inflating away debt is the only way we get out of this GDP/debt mess. If you’ve been watching any of the interviews with Jerome Powell lately, you’ll notice it’s being increasing obvious among the participants of those meetings inflation has begun and is not looking to be transitory. If you’ve been paying attention, this is a complete 180 from what was previously mentioned by these figures since the beginning of the year. Talk is cheap though, keep an eye on the facts presented by monthly statistics (e.g. CPI) and the data being presented by reputable figures (such as Burry) on the topic. I don’t mean to be an alarmist, but don’t discount the idea inflation is here to stay. From what I’ve gathered - and I’ve been obsessively reading information on the topic over the past 6 months since I caught wind of it - there isn’t much uncertainty (U) left, but there remains fear (F - and rightfully so, this hasn’t happen in 40 years although it’s not a 1-to-1 comparison) and doubt (D) by people who haven’t done their due diligence.

Bottomline to me, insofar as inflation is concerned, is that if costs are indeed pressuring market participants that are overextended to begin with (refer to margin debt, unemployment, expiring moratoriums, etc.), then they may have no choice but to go for the exits to pay bills and debt obligations.

44,COIN," Let's say that on one hand, you're fully expecting a 30 to 40 percent correction in the next 6 months. But on the other hand, you know that parking your money for 6 months while stocks continue to run just seems sort of stupid. In this scenario, wouldn't trading on a daily basis, while making sure to liquidate all your positions before market close every day make the most sense? In other words, you basically switch over to a daytrading philosophy, not because you want to be a daytrader, but because one of the advantages of daytrading is quickly cutting losses and not staying in anything overnight. I would think this would help if a crash was just around the corner.

For example, let's say that you're daytrading COIN (Coinbase). You're trying to time the intraday low, and sell towards the high (after the low), and if you predict wrong, you take a 3 percent loss to get out. Also, you get out at the end of the trading day, regardless of the situation.

While not as ideal as normal investing, wouldn't you be protecting yourself from a major market downturn? Each night, your money would be out of the market, so the next day when it opens and everything is a sea of red, yeah, you might jump in at a certain point, thinking you can catch a dip, and then sell for a quick profit, but instead, you'd likely be buying a falling knife and take the 3 percent loss. You'd accumulate a few 3 percent losses before you realized that right now is probably not the time to be in the market and you're better off waiting for the real lows, and then go back to your normal long-term investing strategy.",Anth916,2,/r/stocks/comments/om3rvn/if_market_crashes_due_to_a_restrictions_from_the/h5iy6iv/,0.123,0.786,0.091,-0.8518

57,AI," Google has barely even got started.  They have so many assets yet to be fully monetized.  I think that is the ideal type of investment.

Take YouTube which is just one unit of Google.  In 2021 YouTube in terms of revenue will surpass Netflix.  That is right.  Just YouTube will be bigger than all of Netflix.    Reason is YouTube is growing so much faster than Netflix.

https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2021Q1_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=0cd3d78

Take Android.  Google offers for totally free.   There is well over 1 billion Android phones sold a year.    There is no reason Google could not charge a nominal license fee.   Just a couple of dollars and billions goes to the bottom line with no material additional expense.

Another place is the ad blockers with YouTube.    Google could end that any time they want.  YouTube TV for example it is not possible to skip ads.   But still has targeted ads.     Google has let it go because they wanted YouTube to grow.  But that is no longer necessary and can take away the ad blockers when they want.  I think they will do it slowly.

But the biggest is search.  Google now has over 90% of search and it actually keeps increasing.  Slowly but increasing.  Their chief competitor, Microsoft, lost over 10% of their market share with Bing in just the last year.   All going to Google.

So it creates a great investment opportunity.  Plus search will benefit from the changes made at Apple with iOS.    Companies bid on search keywords.   So some of the money spent at FB and now with the changes on iOS does not work but will still work if you instead bid on a search term.

68,IP," The patent suit is about as bogus as you can get.   Google has nothing to worry about here.

The core problem is the patent system in the US is completely broke.

I do love the approach Google has taken with patents.   They do not play the game of grabbing patents and using them as a weapon.  They instead grab to protect us from someone grabbing and extorting.

Google instead shares their IP and lets people use for free.  The craziest one is VPX.

We were being exploited by the MPEG-LA.  Remember the license fee to use Mpeg2 for example?  It was extortion.

https://www.mpegla.com/programs/mpeg-2/license-agreement/


Google had enough.  They went and created the VPX codecs and then gave away which screwed the MPEG-LA but ended the extortion.    

But then Google went one further.  They even told companies that used VPX that they would offer patent infringement protection.

So Google single handed ended the codec extortion.

BTW, did you ever think why do I never see headlines of Google suing this company or that company for patent infringement?    Google owns tons and tons and tons of patents.   You have not seen them because Google has never conducted themselves like Microsoft and Apple.   Really all the new tech companies tend to shy away from patent trolling like the generation before which includes Apple and Microsoft.

But I think of it more of using patents as a weapon.    The one example of where Google was protecting some IP was with Motorola.  But that suit started before Google acquired and they just let it continue after owning.    The other case there was extending circumstances that you have to include in the case to see why Google was protecting the IP.",bartturner,3,/r/stocks/comments/olvrag/alphabet_inc_goog_upgraded_to_buy_zacks/h5i5fj7/,0.112,0.85,0.038,-0.9669

Here in Texas Housing Market is out of control 
What I heard in News papers and from a local source who works for a title company is 
Houses these days get multiple offers approx. 17 or 23 
Most offers are 15-20 K above housing prices 
There are some Cash offers ( less restrictions and more fast closing due to no bank restrictions and loan restrictions)
 Sellers market they can restrict home inspections.   

I Believe this is happening because of 3 factors 
1) People who worked in some fields like Healthcare and IT saw a increase in compensation. Some finally reached financial maturity where they could not buy houses.   

2) The Biden proposed Tax changes caused people to pull money out and invest in real state as a way to hedge against taxes.
 
3) Is a Mix of low interest rates, and the Stimulus checks and PPP Loans that people got. (all the wrong reasons to qualify and get loads and houses.  ( I came across a Few adds for Industrial equipment for sale, at a heavy discounted prices ) and Someone told me that people used PPP money to buy equipment and machinery and Then sold it off after 8 months to a year got a tax write-offs and then used that money to invest in real state ( someone said soo )",Twisted9Demented,8,/r/stocks/comments/om7ndy/how_would_expiring_cdc_eviction_moratorium_impact/h5jaitn/,0.043,0.903,0.054,0.128

HP's enterprise products are actually really good though, and I've always regarded them as being worth the premium over Dell's offerings in that space.

125,ST," None of those are exciting. You need to understand the market today too. There are so many retail investors and they look for “exciting catalysts”. The space launch was definitely exciting and they should have let the stock run for a week before that offering they did. 

And speaking of those things you mentioned - what’s the financial impact of those deals? 

And you know they aren’t a profitable company right? Even with those space flights it ll take them years to become profitable. It looks like they have a working product which is a start but one small mistake and it ll set them back years cause one disaster and people won’t even get close to buying tickets for their next space flight. 

Their stock is overvalued right now and people can see it. If it goes back down to $15 or less I might think of buying it but only for ST trading. I’m not going to bag hold this stock in the hopes that 7-10 years from now they are going to come good and be profitable YOY.",mic_sco,1,/r/stocks/comments/om0jwp/virgin_galactic_touching_200_dma/h5j0nwg/,0.045,0.836,0.12,0.8936

I understand different protocols may be necessary but the administration can’t even get on the same page as the CDC.   The CDC is the real reason people seem to be hesitant on getting the vaccine.  They have become political.  So we investors have to just sit on our positions or dollar cost average and take advantage of this huge pullback.  I’m in at 500 shares.

134,AAL," 1in 5 sounds worse than it is.  The actual number is 29 in 100,000.   I wish our governor addressed COVID like Florida.  We wouldn’t be in such bad shape.  I’d rather have slightly higher cases now with a vaccine instead of telling people to stay in close quarters without one.   Plus florida has a huge influx of outsiders right now.  So no telling who’s going in to Florida already infected.   But then again many illegals are coming in infected.    So that being said I think cruising will turn around nov/dec time frame.  Which really isn’t that far away.    There is a reason people are flocking to places like Florida.   Cruising will only increase.   The real question is why did AAL promote three other lines but not CCL?   Being a lower cost cruise line maybe the margins aren’t there to begin with.",Vermicious-Knid-,-1,/r/stocks/comments/omavda/ccl_and_american_airlines/h5k10j6/,0.082,0.797,0.121,0.5974

Also pull up the monthly timeframe on ORTX and tell me why it’s a good idea to buy calls. That’s like a perfect descending channel. Would actually be a good short play.",realsapist,1,/r/stocks/comments/om7k1a/need_help_with_the_bear_thesis_on_ortx/h5jivl8/,0.059,0.657,0.284,0.9681

The market will be here forever and there will always be good plays to make. The key is that YOU have to be there to make them. Take some time, if you're serious about this and you really enjoy it, then learn to understand charts and patterns at the minimum.
