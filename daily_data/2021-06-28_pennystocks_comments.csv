1,CVM," I am a data scientist / algo trader who has been trying to solve this for 3 years. The short answer is, IT'S PRETTY DAMN HARD. But it's not impossible, which is the good thing here. I'll talk about one thing here and will leave the rest for some blog post.

Options flow is a great tool to use if you can learn to use it well. If you know anything about any online options flow service, you'll see that they claim all flow works, but those are cherry picked signals that they are sharing on their services. If you backtest them all, you'll see that the accuracy is less than 50%. I can guarantee it.

However, within options flow, something interesting happens with a few tickers everyday. That's called massive repeat flow. In short, sometimes, smart money is extremely confident of a move that they buy out of the money calls with a very large amount of money. If that's the case, and there's no other flow on the opposite side i.e if a stock is at 20 and smart money is buying 5 million dollars worth of 30 strike calls with no puts in the flow, that's A STRONG SIGNAL. In my three years of experience, this has been one of the strongest signals. You have to find repeat and dominant flow, everything else is most of the times just noise.

When you see massive repeat flow with far out of the money calls, that's a signal that something big might happen. One very recent example would be CVM 40 calls that came in on June 25th for 40 strike. Stock price was only at 25. Today, pre-market, CVM is up 8%. There you go.

This is also a quick tutorial for anyone who's getting into options flow to find trade ideas. Hope this will help everyone. Don't look for any flow, look for massive repeat flow.

Finally, a disclaimer and a shameless plug. I have a twitter page where I share repeat flow plays every day for free. If you want to get some ideas, give us a follow at @ ***Tradytics*** on twitter. You'll find tons of ideas and also get a sense of how we go about finding repeat flow.

4,CTXR," I claim no great expertise, but I try to look at things I know and predict which companies have potential. I am in healthcare so I look for companies working on patents for drugs or products that have a huge potential for massive marketability. Think of the COVID vaccine as an example. Moderna (MRNA) is up nearly 10x its pre pandemic value.

Currently I like CTXR because they have a product in phase 3 testing that meets a significant need in healthcare. That said, if this product (Mino-lok) doesn’t gain approval, the companies stock value will plummet. They claim they have 4 products in the pipeline, but only one has much potential, and 2 seems like complete garbage. This company is likely to shoot up 3-4x or drop to nothing.

7,DD, Easiest way to answer this. Find high value stable stocks. When all stocks in that category do poorly (tech over the last three months is a good example) buy on the start of the rebound. This is always a sure thing if you buy stable large name stocks. It isn’t going to make you rich but it will give you gains to gamble on risky stocks and have more cash to do so.

9,DD," Look for mentions that are increasing, Look for volume increasing, Do some DD on the tickers to see if they have a story that would justify a run.

A lot of people play OTC custodianships for fast wins. A good example of this is HPIL was a dark company that went through custodianship and was awarded. Went from no volume to some on the hype of the company being live again. The company was awarded and transferred to new ownership and gained more volume. Now the company is pushing their plan and releasing lots of news so volume is now over 1B a day. It is very volatile at the moment but has huge potential for a win.

These are what is getting peoples attention.

Proven management - Stephen Brown (CEO has taken companies to Nasdaq before)

A plan - Lots of plans currently, is hitting all the hot topics so might be too much but we will see.

Cheap Entry - trading under 1 cent but was .0002 in the last 6 months. (Looks like it ran but has lots of room to go.)

Open Communication - Lots of tweets and news releases from the company. Working on several fronts to increase value.

&#x200B;

$PRMO has similar potential, just awarded custodianship to Small Cap Compliance. Now we wait and see what company acquires the shell and what they do with it. It will run on hype and each step towards becoming a new company and getting compliant. (This one will likely not get current before the deadline but could run hard once it is all done. Catch it is could be 3 months or over a year. High risk, potential high reward.)

&#x200B;

There are lots of other ways as well such as knowing what catalysts are expected. This is very important for biotech and Teledoc plays. With your DD you should be able to see what is coming and buy in for the runs. RQHTF is a good example. Your DD should show it is at the point of becoming profitable with a massive backlog of orders expected to come online over the next 2 years. It is a take over target and a sector disrupter.

Do lots of research. it will serve you well. Especially in Penny Stocks.

An example : Goldman Sachs released a report last year about how the drone market was going to expand over the next decade. Ark Invest expects the drone delivery market to reach 14B in 2024 and go to $113B by 2030. If you had followed that and bought for example AgEagle at $0.5 in February 2020, then you would be up over 10x now with shares at $5.33. They even reached $15.7 ATH. Draganfly was also at similar price and you could have done a x3 at current price or x6 at ATH. There are more examples of these Drone companies that you can look at. So you invest in the right ones and things turn out bullish as Ark thinks then you could x100 by 2030. There are a lot of factors to take in and you should do your own research as usual.

48,ATOS," I'm holding ATOS. If you read and believe the DD from Fat, he said in Part 2 when the stock price was in the neighborhood of $5.38/share that most of the big gains were yet to occur. 

To me that means that even when it went to $8 or $8.50/share the stock price (if you believe the DD) still has room to run, because $3/share over $5.38 doesn't sound like the major gains he's describing.

55,ATH," It hit ATH after ATH last week. Whenever values go up there’s always a dip. It dipped everyday last week, it just happened to climb higher and higher is all. So what happened after Friday was really a combination of things. Profit takers being most notable. This was under $2 early this year. Of course there’d be tons of profit takers. Next up were stop losses from both long term holders and ppl who had fomo’d in last week. After that were paper handers who likely bought in of the hype and sold at the first sign of red. Which caused that entire cycle to rinse and repeat. I got in low so while tempted to sell, purely so I could buy in at a lower price and have a lot more shares. I just decided to hold. I’m still UP and in great position. Within the next half year I expect at least 3 catalysts to rally positive sentiments and push this into double digits. Low double digits. Double digits nonetheless. I’m investing with money that would’ve just been sitting in the bank doing nothing.

There is a claim it has a high short interest, but I only have seen 11% which is up there but that’s not going to cause a squeeze. 

The big thing last week was the ITM call buys versus put buys, the difference was massive - which leads to bullish sentiment. It was added to the Russell today, adding more bullish sentiment. 

They have a nasal covid spray that can cause bullish sentiment with the current feta variant beginning to make waves and anti-vax sentiment at an all time high. 

I believe they are sitting on a good amount of cash and are potentially debt free.

66,ATOS," To all ATOSians, please let me mention something because I see some panic since last Friday. 

When I bought ATOS at 0.91$ it jumped to 4$, from there it went to 1.50$, then it went back again to 4$ and 6$.

So we had the last drop to 4$ and then shooting to the current prices. Do you see the pattern (climbing higher with some corrections)? All that time I am holding…. I remember that when ATOS was at 4$ and dropped to 1.50$ there was discussion and panic…. So I just see the same again.

Last time that I checked nothing changed in order to affect our investment case! I will continue to HOLD and paper hands/day traders can do their part just don’t cry that you missed an opportunity!

Last thing to consider ATOS has a low float so can be volatile!

218,DD," I think the original DD was relatively non-memey, spoke to risks, downsides, etc. (Search u/fataspirations for DD part 1 and 2) 

In terms of further research it's unpredictable short term but I think there's a growing short-term bull case (I'm hoping for $11 as a new floor come OPEX week) but w/ the way we've recovered today + increased short interest I think things could be bubbling for much larger short term pop than expected... and if that DOESN'T happen, then I'm happy to have bought my tickets now for a possible acquisition as endoxifen comes to market and becomes a mass market treatment for breast cancer. A $2B valuation would be $16 a share... Am I okay with that as a mid-to-long term hold? 100%. 

Personally, I'm not selling until at least $11/share at OPEX week (or if it goes crazy to 15+ before that). At (around) that point I'll start unloading small portions of my position, maybe 2.5-5% at a time (e.g. if OPEX, 2.5 at 11 or so, 2.5 at 12, 5 at 13, etc.) depending on momentum and what I deem to be appropriate DD at that time.

Positive for those holding; now a large percent of the stocks float is owned by funds that can’t sell.  

This means smaller effective float, so if that same money that bought-sold last week buys back in for the next run, it will spike much harder.

246,ATOS," all that matters are facts.

True P&D schemes are full of fake events/catalysts that don't come true.

For ATOS, a catalyst for forced buying was named to be russel inclusion, as a precursor to July OPEX (options expirations) which will be more forced buying.

This did occur; this wasn't a fake or overhyped event.  A large amount of shares were purchased.  The difference is, many swing traders and institutions sold that news.  We had a net-sell event of alot of hype buildup to the inclusion.

However, now that part of the float is owned by index funds and won't be sold.  This increases the price pressure of every new buy in the future.  So catalyst 1 of this play/thesis is complete.

On the aggregate, the stock is still up which is great.  It has not tanked through the center of the earth.

A true P&D you see an absolute, lights out, goodnight, type of crash and no future catalysts/chance of redemption.  

$30-50 has been referenced by a few calculations as making sense as a ""buyout"" price which in a stock like this is a possibility as the drug can compete with tamoxifen, which was bought-out.  A buyout can occur prior to phase 3 completion, if the drug appears viable.  This is more of a long-term thesis.

Personally, I feel that as we approach options expiration week July 16th with SO MANY options expiring, there will be another run up by speculative institutions and retail and day traders closer to the day of catalyst.

Even better?  Now we have a smaller float due to index inclusion and forced buying.  

So heading into Opex if the same money that left decides to come back and play again, we will see a harder spike than before, because of smaller float.  

Also, people don't give hard price targets because it's not being valued on traditional ""value"" metrics.  This is a speculative play based on multiple catalysts, the biggest being the July 16th OPEX.  

I think speculative play with catalysts is much different than P&D, which we have seen go up and crater in 1-2 days and then never be seen again and often on fake information.  

These catalysts are hard and true, but no one can know what individual retailers and institutions will do for certain.  

Not financial advice.  I just like ATOS and this play.",WeReallyOutHere420,4,/r/pennystocks/comments/o9byy5/the_loungedaily_plays_june_28_2021/h3bzic2/,0.067,0.856,0.077,0.2721

253,ATOS," think about it like this; the stock price was artificially pumped last week a bit by day traders + institutions playing the short game on the russel index inclusion.  

now, the shares purchased by the russel index funds are removed from the float.  ATOS is still above $7 and it has been MUCH lower the past couple weeks.

So in the next few weeks, speculators and swing traders and eventually day traders will hop back in.

If we theoretically get the same money back in, the price will theoretically spike higher than before (so into $10+ for example) before even considering the smaller float that now exists. (smaller float means harder spike in prices on buying).

So you take that setup, and you combine the OPEX catalyst, AND you combine any extra hype generated in the next couple of weeks to bring in more retail/institutions to buy...

decide for yourself what will happen then.  There will probably be some ""sell the news"" type stuff on the 16th and then the play long term becomes waiting for aquisiton news for a $40 price or so.

also, it isn't a big deal that short term investors took profits, that's likely pros and paper hands, and they come just as fast as they go.  Im impressed ATOS is holding this price level as well as it is.
