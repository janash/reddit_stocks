0,ATOS," Nice DD ! I completely agree! Maybe a good addition or correction. Endoxifen is a metabolite of Tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is converted in the liver, by a specific enzym, to Endoxifen, which has the anti tumor effect. Lot of women who now receive Tamoxifen have a lack of that specific enzym and are unable to produce enough endoxifen. Resulting in NO anti tumor effect. Bringing (Z)-Endoxifen immediately in the body was not that simple, because in acidic environement (the stomach acid), it is converted into (E)-Endoxifen, which is so stable that it will be completely useless. That's why ATOS has a second patent on endoxifen and this is the enteric capsule, which brings Z-Endoxifen, untouched, into the small intestine where it is absorbed into the bloodstream. So it bypasses the liver. AND BECAUSE Endoxifen is a metabolite of Tamoxifen, we are able to apply for pathway 505B2, which can skip a phase 3 trial and get FDA approval after succesfull P2 data. Cheers to that !",Hannibal_Smith95,12,/r/pennystocks/comments/124nzt5/why_im_bullish_on_atos_atossa_therapeutics_and/je0beo5/,0.107,0.793,0.1,0.3763

15,IBIO," >At the time of writing, IBIO trades at just under $2. Unfortunately, circumstances suggest that it may have much more to fall.

>It’s not just about the terrible market loss, though it did hemorrhage 82% in the trailing year. Rather, the financials give little reason for confidence. For example, Ibio’s cash-to-debt ratio sits at 0.47 times. This stat ranks worse than 89% of its competitors. Also, its debt-to-equity ratio is 1.08, worse than 91% of sector peers.

>Operationally, Ibio’s three-year EBITDA growth rate comes in at 91.4% below parity. Also, its operating and net margins have completely fallen off the rails. Gurufocus calls IBIO a possible value trap, which may be an understatement. Lastly, covering analysts peg IBIO as a consensus hold. Their average price target pings at 50 cents, indicating over 74% downside risk. In other words, it’s probably one of the stocks to sell.
