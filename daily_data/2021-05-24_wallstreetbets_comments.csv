We joke about being stupid or whatever but the truth is that it's a way to shed some of the negative head space that occurs with losses. If you would cry about it, laugh about it instead, there will always be someone else with a higher loss.

Shit I took 20k in unrealized losses on the MVIS knife dropping. You know what I did? I sold worthless calls to other tards to the tune of 18k.

So for all you young/new bloods that came in because you saw a rocket on the news and didn't have any sense.

Absolute rocket fuel, in my opinion. My cost average is around $9 for 1000 shares from the original COVID crash, and I have 15 $30 6/4c. I’ve held my shares for over a year through all of the ups and downs because I know the hype from Branson flying will be unlike anything we’ve ever seen before.

217,FREE," Let me tell you why I will buy puts. 

The Theory of Robinhood and WallStreetBets.

• When people see something on WSB and they read all this dd, the first thing they might do, is buy, and chances are they will buy on RH as they are the dominant player in the retail WSB apes. 

• When you buy on RH, you are on a Margin Account which means you don't technically own the stock. You basically have an 'IOU' from RH and they take your money. 

• RH's goal is to fuck you out of your money. This means, if 10,000 people buy SPCE, they will take 10,000 and short. If they short and can drive the price down, of those 10,000 people who own IOU's half of them will sell back their IOU at the new short price (let's say 50%). This means RH just made 50% FREE MONEY on you AND they made money on the short & rebuy. So it's a win-win because retail sells and cries. They never really purchased SPCE, they just gave you an IOU for those shares. 

• So, when 10,000 apes drop 1,000,000 in cash, here is what happens. Due to ""payment for order flow"", Citadel sees that a million dollars of buys are coming. Price is $38. So, Citadel jumps that line, buying 1M also. So Citadel buys at $38, driving the price to $39, and retail buys drive the price at $39, pushing it to $40.

Then, Citadel sells at $40, making a $2 profit in SECONDS. and the price, literally SECONDS after you buy, at $39, which pushes it to $40, now drops back to $39 and sometimes even less.

218,RH," Let me tell you why I will buy puts. 

The Theory of Robinhood and WallStreetBets.

• When people see something on WSB and they read all this dd, the first thing they might do, is buy, and chances are they will buy on RH as they are the dominant player in the retail WSB apes. 

• When you buy on RH, you are on a Margin Account which means you don't technically own the stock. You basically have an 'IOU' from RH and they take your money. 

• RH's goal is to fuck you out of your money. This means, if 10,000 people buy SPCE, they will take 10,000 and short. If they short and can drive the price down, of those 10,000 people who own IOU's half of them will sell back their IOU at the new short price (let's say 50%). This means RH just made 50% FREE MONEY on you AND they made money on the short & rebuy. So it's a win-win because retail sells and cries. They never really purchased SPCE, they just gave you an IOU for those shares. 

• So, when 10,000 apes drop 1,000,000 in cash, here is what happens. Due to ""payment for order flow"", Citadel sees that a million dollars of buys are coming. Price is $38. So, Citadel jumps that line, buying 1M also. So Citadel buys at $38, driving the price to $39, and retail buys drive the price at $39, pushing it to $40. This happens so fast, that retail doesn't get why they bought in at $38 but really paid $39. Then, Citadel sells at $40, making a $2 profit in SECONDS. and the price, literally SECONDS after you buy, at $39, which pushes it to $40, now drops back to $39 and sometimes even less.

228,GME," A short squeeze is totally disconnected from any fundamental value. When you short a stock you have to return the shares. So all the buying pressure will be coming from the hedge funds when they are forced to buy back shares that they borrowed. The problem is you're a hedgefund and you shorted more stocks than are available because you've always been able to do whatever you've wanted to with no consequences. But now the only shares available are owned by apes who are not selling which drives the price to the moon. That's the situation in a nutshell. 

Other short squeezes have occured with 20% short interest but GME is at least 140% but with the way the numbers are being fudged and hidden, I'm thinking it's actually 200-500%. Based on what comparable situations we have, there's no way this isn't touching 100's of thousands per share and I'm betting it goes into the millions. It's not about money anymore, it's about justice for the 2008 crash and other thievery. Apes are dead set on holding until every hedgefund involved in this circus is liquidated. That's why this is on a completely different level than any other squeeze in history.",DavidoftheDoell,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/njx45g/apes_vs_msm_and_short_sellers/gzb3rau/,0.104,0.81,0.085,-0.6428

If retail keeps buying and no one sells they could in theory drive the price up to $40. But the catch is only a few percentage of them would ever get that if sold.

614,AAL," There’s a lot that goes into airlines that needs to be considered here, and they’re the determinantes behind a lot of the disparities in relative valuations. Some examples:

What is the average utilization of a flight? Some airlines have been filling middle seats while others have kept them free. Pre-covid even, some airlines were much better optimizing their flights than others for higher utilization (e.g. Delta was king of this before the pandemic)

What routes do the airlines cover? Is it mostly cheap Inter-hub destinations with low margins? Or niche vacation spots with higher margins but lower utilization? What percent is international versus domestic, and how does the environment look for international travel? 

Also, a huge part of airlines is where they are in their aircraft cycle — did they just upgrade and already went through the capex spend so they’re well-positioned going forward? Or do they need to buy a new fleet and are going to hemorrhage cash in the next few years?

How are they levered? AAL is over levered relative to peers, hence the discount.

What percentage of their corporate versus consumer? Which demographic is expected to bounce back more quickly post Covid? (Answer: Consumer - this is why Southwest is trading so well while United has lagged.)

Achieves Record First Quarter Sales and Earnings Results

Ends FY 2021 First Quarter with $100.1 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents, No Debt

Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend by 20% to $0.18 per Share

Declares Special Cash Dividend of $1.00 per Share

My point is attempting to price in a specific sector. If money is flowing in like that for Big 5, then Dick's, Academy Sports, Hibbett etc. are likely seeing that money as well. With that said, if Dick's earnings are good, smarter money than us is going to start evaluating the value of sporting goods stores and I believe ASO is well positioned for a run up.",jbro12345,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/njh97r/aso_dd_in_preparation_for_dks_earnings/gz8it3s/,0.03,0.815,0.155,0.9477

You can look up the definition of ""interested party"" in the FAR to understand what it means in the context of Government Contracting.  For PLTR to be in contention and have a piece of ""JEDI"", the DoD would have to cancel the requirement in its entirety and re-solicit the requirement that has to be vastly different from the original to mitiate legal ramification from MSFT & AMZN.

I am sure they priced in loss revenues from adjusting their delivery distances, but they will most likely make up for it in the cost savings by merging the apps.   


Plus, the value in Uber is the re-opening play. Once their rides business picks up, with a sustained Eats division, expect them to hit profitability by EOY. They shed off a lot of their moon-shots divisions, and have great investments on the balance sheets.

10% of their entire business is essentially a tumor?",Footsteps_10,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nk5tew/opendoor_a_sleeping_giant/gzb68x3/,0.194,0.769,0.037,-0.8567

848,IAG, In airlines I like IAG. (British Airways and Iberian). Largest cash reserves of European airlines. Still under 50% of pre covid price. The British government will not let it fail. I’m prepared to hold for longer than a year but when the profitable transatlantic routes to get going again it should jump. There may be dips and better opportunities to buy before then if there is bad news about covid but I can’t see it staying so low forever.,Teejaydub7,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/njot8z/latam_airlines_ltmaq/gz9beo0/,0.09,0.734,0.175,0.7062

Thanks for your comment! Just checked them out too and looks like a lot of potential for recovery as well. I will get some of IAG stock as well, I already have Latam but I'm ready to hold for a couple months.

If i would of just held cash I’d be able to not pay capital gains tax on the premium profit and not be down on the position.
