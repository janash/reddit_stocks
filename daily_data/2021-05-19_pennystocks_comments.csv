5,IMO," LAC - Thacker Pass should be the best sedimentary Lithium asset in North America. Ganfeng just announced they may build a battery plant in Argentina where they also own a Lithium mine w/ LAC. Potentially huge news. I personally like their Arizona plant a lot though (Thacker Pass) as the US wants to get their metals here. It's been called a matter of national security. PLL & LTHM are of interest here also.

PDAC - SPAC taking Li-Cycle public, which has amazing technology and connections.

WWR - Graphite (and USA). 

ABML - Another recycler with some great tech located near Tesla.

NNOMF - Nano One has technology that auto manufacturers need. For further reading look up their NMC811 breakthrough technology. 

I'm biased as I have all of these stocks. They've done really well for me and I hope they move higher soon. Most have been amazing for me. They've all been hit really hard lately. LAC is one of my favorites but you won't get rich overnight with it and they won't be producing until next year. That said, it has a lot of $20-$30 targets on it and it they should be coming online as Lithium demand continues to surge. IMO PDAC got crushed with all the other SPACs but is a solid company. ABML & NNOMF probably have very bright futures. ABML was .20 not long ago and it is shooting for NASDAQ up-listing in 2021. You can't be green without recycling. WWR was $12 not long ago.

64,WTI," I'm expecting the distribution to continue to grow through Aug or Sept month on month as the operator on lease has costs associated and they should decrease as production increases based on their recent 10-Q and budget for the year this seems to be inline to start increasing significantly as long as oil can stay in the $55-65 range. If WTI Crude price jumps due to inflation concerns or supply/demand to above $75 the price of the equity will get a lot of love from institutions taking cover from the tech markets uncertainty and overextention imo.

**$WRHLF** is going to be huge within the next several months. Love Hemp CBD is currently sitting at *$.043 with 733mil outstanding shares*.

This means advertisements on the ring, commercials, fighter promotions, etc... *Upcoming catalysts* would be every fight night starting June 5th,  June 12th fight with Israel Adesanya, and the July 10th fight with Conor McGregor and Dustin Poirier.

70,IVR," I like IVR. As long as you realize the covid crash basically caused a hard reset for them: They're not going back to that price point anytime even remotely soon.
