It was great watching my earnings go up insanely but I sold at $10 after it went from $20->7 last Thursday after wallstreet changed the rules and I'm honestly shocked over the whole thing. Now, do I buy back in with the casino money or just watch from the sidelines?

34,DD," To my fellow Investors please check out CETY at $0.10 per share. CETY owns patented heat recovery technology that takes wasted heat from existing operations and converts it into renewable electricity.

CETY essentially turns wasted heat into renewable electricity and now gets tax credits for corporations under the Biden Administration. They create this renewable electricity at the source where it is being used. Not out in the desert which requires infrastructure to transport that electricity to Cities. 

CETY technology was originally developed by General Electric and sold off to avoid bankruptcy protection and to bet on oil. Well GE was wrong and it will be proven soon enough. 

CETY has waste heat recovery systems in several countries throughout Europe. They have partnerships in Russia and a presence in China..and CETY is based in Southern California with a legit website. 

CETY has short term catalysts coming our way and is poised for exponential growth. Waste heat recover market is in the Billions and expected to continue growing exponentially.

I was in the fuel cells stocks and they all grew 10x-20x. CETY will do the same.

This is not a pump and dump. This is a company that will run up organicly but I would love for you all to join me.

For example you can buy it on binance. Depending how long you're planning to hold the token and whether you want to hold it in your own wallet you can either hold it on binance (binance is good but the general rule of thumb is not your keys not your coins) or send it to your own from binance. There will be a withdrawal page in your binance spot wallet where you'd put your nano address. There's normally a small fee (in the token) to withdraw to another wallet.

To add to that, you need to start with some crypto to trade with. So for example you could buy through coinbase, for example ETH from your local currency. send that eth to binance, then trade it for Nano as Binance has a NANO/ETH trading pair. That's one way to do it. Each coin has a trading pair(s) on exchanges.",superphotonerd,4,/r/pennystocks/comments/l981su/well_its_my_first_full_week_trading/glh8dhl/,0.0,0.963,0.037,0.4588

Second, they will use such proceeds to replace high cost (up to15%) existing indebtedness with low cost debt from new shares issue and this will positively impact next financial results.
 
Third, part of such proceeds will be also used to fund new activities and investments (like electric vehicle R&D).

200,AMC," I’ve been investing using stash for a while now. I’ve made decent gains, and I’m proud of what I’ve done as a total newbie. 

I opened a Charles Schwab account because I wanted to start looking at penny stocks thanks to this group. I must be misunderstanding something or I need to wait until the market opens or something, because I’m trying to place an order to buy SNDL, and it keeps telling me I can’t place the order because I don’t have sufficient funds to cover it. I tried stop limit, limit, and it doesn’t matter. I get the same message. I even tried just a single stock with my $10 in my account available, and nothing. 

Do I need a lot more in the account, do I need to wait for the market to open? 

I thought, oh I’ll start with just 10 and wait so I can’t lose more than $10 since I’ve never bought anything like this before. (My current investments are in Apple, amazon, Shopify, Nokia, and AMC.) I have about $200 in everything but Nokia and AMC-those are $25-$30 ... 

Stash is a simple place the order for a certain $ amount and it executes in one of their trading windows. Charles Schwab has the timing and order type that are still slightly confusing to me, but I thought I understood what I was doing. I wanted to stay super small until I grasped those a little better.

212,DD," Hail mary stock suggestion with zero DD. 

Aselsan turkish defense contractor that doubled in value in the last 2 years and is getting more orders from a nation that keeps increasing its defense budgets. With the current economic situation in turkey, there is potential to go up in value in two ways


1. With a potentially stronger lira as opposed to the dollar (the stock is listed in liras which makes it a bargain for dollar portfolios) i.e. lira goes up, value goes up when converting the stock back to cash

2. Turkey’s aim of going 100% domestic when it comes to defense needs and exporting more arms in the future (for reference, it’s defense exports went from 300 mln to 2.3 bln within a decade) with the recent conflicts only adding to the visibility of its drones. 

I’m a complete newbie when it comes to DD and this analysis is based more on geopolitical events rather than fundamentals.

Always have a strategy, stick to it, and learn to accept two things: you will have losing trades, and some days, it's better to shut down your laptop/phone, and walk away from it and just take the day off, because there are just some days, where the setups won't come.

287,EV," Groovy! The basic premise is that European Metals operates the Cinovec Lithium/Tin Project, which is the largest hard-rock lithium resource in Europe. It's located approximately 100km north of Prague, on the border of Germany. This places it in the middle of Europe's largest EV and chemical manufacturers, like Tesla, BASF, Volkswagen, etc. For these reasons, and many more that I'll expand on in a longer post, it makes the resource a compelling speculation.

Beyond the fundamentals, and long term thesis, I've recently increased my position in anticipation of a near-term catalyst. If you look at companies such as Piedmont ($PLL) and Lithium Americas ($LAC), you'll see that they experienced incredible price action after the announcement of off-take agreements. Consider how the price of Piedmont reacted after they announced their deal with Tesla. 

European Metals investor relations indicated that they expect their first off-take agreement to be announced during Q1 of 2021, which means it could happen any time between now and in two months. Naturally, this is no guarantee, but it bolds well. Additionally, myself and many other investors have been pressuring the company to acquire a Nasdaq listing, which is now only a matter of time. 

Recently, European Metals hired Rodney Hooper. Now, you'll probably say, ""who the fuck is Rodney Hooper"". He is the former independent industry expert who worked with Piedmont to complete the Tesla deal.

If I had to speculate, I would suggest that European Metals will sign an off-take agreement with Tesla to supply their Berlin-Brandenburg factory. However, it could certainly be another major manufacturer like Volkswagen or BMW. 

There is a lot to digest in this analysis, and I think it warrants its own post.",thirtydelta,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/l97a1l/possible_otc_catalyst_robinhood_defection/gli24zx/,0.032,0.868,0.1,0.9189

301,NAKD,"  this is from uncle\_\_\_b

This post made me buy in bc it was a reasonable look at the company. Its probably not going to 100 in a week, but I see it as a great holding for a while and I like the 1.70 price.

WHY I am buying NAKD:

* Short float of 75% (75% of all shares that are outstanding are being shorted)
* Naked Brand was at risk being delisted from Nasdaq as it hasn't been able to maintain the $1 per share price to stay compliant, this is solved now as they have reached $1+
* Yesterday NAKD announced that it has entered into securities purchase agreements with certain institutional investors for the issuance and sale of 29,415,000 of its ordinary shares at a price of $1.70 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $50 million, this deal will be settled at 1 Feb! This ensures trust and will probably drive the price up after this deal has been done.
* As they have stated since January 21th, NAKD is busy restructuring the company from boring fashion retail into focussing on e-commerce (which will drive the fk future)

In addition, they are not (yet) expensive and the market cap is small (325,263 M), so there is room for growth.

I don't think it will hit $10 immediately, but $7-9 should be achievable.

325,PM, I’m doubling my position Monday- when it starts moving over a penny I’ll slowly start selling for profits but I’m holding my initial position at least through February or until it hits 1$. Ex) if I were to have 2 mil shares right now I’ll buy 2 mil more Monday. When it start to pump I’ll slowly sell every few pennies until I’m either back to 2 mil or still above. No matter what I’m going to hold the initial 2 mil for a few months. A realistic price target for me “pre settlement” is < .05 ...however depending on how much publicity this receives from Reddit and social media I think 1$ within a month is doable. Regardless of the valuation or market cap. If PM settles outside of court it will only take 80 million$ to buy back the % of the float needed to restructure the stock price to a realistic value.

427,SBE," My thought, for example, Entertainment stocks are too unpredictable if you aren't reading a lot about trends or have a knack for recognizing them early.  If you have the DD, there are some decent sports betting stocks coming up. But again, you've got to read and see what each start up is doing and how far along.  Varying State Legislation is a big read  in this one. I dumped with a good profit some EV car startups....and weed stocks too. Cool companies but the road is being built as one slow car at a time is being designed.  Way too many foreseeable roadblocks. I got in and out except for NIO, that's a force, the real deal, long term hold. Another thing, energy for example isn't a luxury, it's a necessity and not as volatile to the whims of culture and trends, though not entirely without risk. Example, SBE a company with advanced EV charging technology had all the earmarks of growth before it took off. In August for your $100,  you'd now have roughly $400.

443,RBC," Don't use Questrade for penny stocks on a margin account. It's incredibly annoying and even though my mom is up by over $1k on each of her 2 OTC stocks, she keeps getting a ""margin call"" notification on red days, telling her to transfer $45 or $60 or $20 randomly. Apparently it can be avoided if you first exchange your CAD to USD, then initiate the trade. The fact they basically force you to put your non-registered account on margin and not a cash account is lame. My TFSA is with them though. 


Regardless, I use RBC for my OTC stocks. They've also helped make me a ton of money because even though it wasn't a margin account, they let me dip into the negatives (by $10k) which I only did because I had delays for money coming in from elsewhere. u/aleve089 - Obviously I covered it within a week to avoid having positions liquidated.",buccca,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/l9dm58/new_to_this_where_can_i_buy_penny_stocks_in_canada/gli2d5f/,0.07,0.93,0.0,-0.8553

Looking at a similar european company  TLGRF, and comparing WWR and GPHOF as they are in the same field and relatively within the same stage, I came up with a few lingering questions before I understand what this all means.

461,DD," Agreed with the comments below.  A penny stock by itself is not a pump and dump, but they can be used as a mode of pump an dump schemes. 

If one runs any business they know there are only 2 ways to get capital to start and grow a company.  That is either a bank/ debt or through issuing common stock.  These are companies that are young and didn't have the assets to get bank loans large enough to get going.  So the fact they don't have easy access to capital through banks makes them high risk by nature, but don't make them a scam. 

Now the fact they are not invested by professional money and thus have no analyst coverage is good and bad.  It is that reason you can find good companies starting to grow without being well known and thus being undervalued.  BUT that is the same reason you can have a shady company saying they do x, y, and z and get away with it since there is no experts looking into it AND having much looser financial reporting guidelines.

More DD is needed in this arena.  But then again Enron was not a penny so fraud can/ does happen everywhere.",10xwannabe,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/l9a2yb/what_have_i_missed_how_are_pennystocks_legal_and/glhemij/,0.132,0.79,0.077,-0.9266
