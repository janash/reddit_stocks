2,HUGE," This! Every since the Gme hedge fund craze there was a HUGE interest in penny stocks. I mean you had people who never even gave it a second thought to build some assists and trade jumping in because they heard gme went from 2$ to over 300$. Then that’s all they could think about. Whose gonna be the next gme. That was literally a once in a lifetime thing and if you think those hedge funds would be stupid enough to let it happen again let alone so soon after losing BILLIONS, you don’t belong here. I’ve been here for a year now and I’ve learned a lot about trading and penny stocks and a lot of people here do their dd and we all tend to look our for one another. But I’ve been seeing one too many posts about “it’s a short stock let’s send it through the roof, this can be the next gme, etc” this isn’t what we do here and I wish those people would go to wsb for all of that or make their own sub. Don’t ruin it for the rest of us, some people here really invest everything. For the newcomers who mean well then I say to you welcome, I hope you learn a lot like I did. You gonna be in for a bumpy ride, you gonna win some, then lose some, then win a bit more and lose a lot more.

6,AQMS," Hello to all! New to Reddit, but have been trading for 20 years, but not for a living. I have read a lot of post from new traders and the best advice I can give is always be careful of those pumping any stock. Take a moment and just type the ticker into any search engine and just read all you can especially on penny stock companies. Yes, even the biggest companies had to start somewhere, but make sure you think about what that company does and look at every day trends around you and ask yourself this, does this make sense in the real world and will it catch on? 
Now this by no means is a pump at all!! Here are a few I own and a few im looking to enter and the reason why.

I own AITX. Why I own..because to me artificial intelligence is the way of the future and we will not go backwards to old ways. 

ASTI   I own because I look at our current administration and they are friendly to alternative power such as solar so this makes sense to me. 

SNDL    I own because once again this administration is friendly to cannabis and I believe this will also be more accepted just like alcohol was after prohibition. 

AQMS   I don’t own looking for entry point  because I feel recycling is growing especially metals of this type will be a win win situation. 

These are just my thoughts for the regular investor and if it helps 1 person I’m happy. Best to all and God bless. :-)",StAnthonyleadus2it,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ldjysl/no_new_members/gm8bt1j/,0.009,0.756,0.235,0.9971

115,VERY," $INM (InMed Pharmacuticals) - They have clinical trials for two products - cream and eyedrops w/ cannibinol. They have a process for E. Coli driven biosynthesis of cannibinol, that is pretty unique, since everyone else uses yeast. Its trading at 4.50, earnings coming out Feb 16th, expecting .50 - 1.5 price jump. While its good short term stock, I'd say its a possible long-term play as well.   


  
$XXII is also very good looking right now, its recently broken past its $3 resistance. Even though its had 275% gains in the last few months, it is still MASSIVELY undervalued. If it can secure even 1% of the smoker demo in the coming months, it would be valued at around $10. Also has incredible collaborations with other orgnizations in the cannabis/agriculture space - if you check them out, you'll feel even more confident with where this company can go.  This, I  believe, is a VERY long term play. Not because it won't have massive growth in 2-3 months, but because it will keep gaining substantial ground for years.",PsychedelicParamour,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ldxkho/whats_your_favourite_plays_for_next_week/gm9eyqf/,0.02,0.846,0.134,0.9413

Hey guys been looking for tickers lately that have some healthy movement going on and saw VYNE. Ill break down my Pros and Cons for you

&#x200B;

Pro#1: Avg Volume (10m) Has a low float very nice! ($.5B Market Cap)

Pro#2:AMZEEQ Approval (Beginning of Feb was approved and Dermatologist are very interested in this version and the engineering behind this form of acne medication). Acnes not going anywhere anytime soon this could become something very good in the acne medication sector.

Pro#3: No split history

Pro#4: Revenue growth +161% in last 5 years ($4M rev growth since last December alone)

Pro#5: One week from now last year (2020) VYNE spiked to $5+ when it was sitting at $2+ days before (+15% spike in the last week looking kinda hot rn ;)

Pro#6: [Ceo seems like a hot shot no doubt](https://vynetherapeutics.com/who-we-are/)

Pro#7: 100% buy rating on Robinhood which is cool I guess? lmao

Con#1: $32M long term debt and Presence of Cash burn rate. Revenue is incredible with this company but thier debt is the only thing weighing this big boi down (interest is accumulating on their debt lets hope this Acne Medicine brings them out the red)

Con#2: Post and Pre-Pandemic dips when Vyne is doing nothing at all it sits in at around $1.25 to $2.05 not horrible but not great either.

&#x200B;

Whats your guys idea? I like the name and I like the stock looking to buy for $2.10 next week. Ill prob even call em next week and ask about their acne medicine.",PoprocksSmoke69,5,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ldm66z/daily_discussion_thread/gm7ba6x/,0.079,0.792,0.129,0.8871

1st... they’re balance sheet is... ok... kinda 

Long term debt is in the millions (12+mill) to be exact. Overall assets have Increased 8% over the last year. Very nice. 

Sexiest part of the stock the FLOAT and the Gentics part. Float is extremely sexy with this one AVG daily volume is in the 3mill range with a Market cap of 201M dollars when looking for penny stocks hope they have a low float (just something I learned a while back)

Almost one year ago today AGTC did a public offering of 32.5M shares (2/9/20) I have a slight feeling ones coming up (this is just my version of saying there’s a clearance sale going on lol)

Wait for Premarket on Monday if you see a large spike there’s some momentum building if you see it’s taking a dive day traders have juiced this bad boi for now and are moving on expect some news in the middle of the week (conference on the 11th) this is most def a long term hold stock my friend

- TEVA hasn’t budged in the last year and it has zero moat, though it has a $13B MC compared to NEOS’ $40M MC. Sort of apples and oranges. But the world of pharm you gotta look at the product line. You need a revenue stream and patent protection and some strong R&D. 

*Mildly off topic but Takeda bought Shire in 2019 and they got Adderall XR brand along with Vyvanse and 4 other drugs that pull WAY more yearly revenues than Adderall does (Vyvanse pulled $2.4B in 2018 while Adderall XR made $300M).*",holupholupohok,4,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ldkry1/lets_talk_about_neos_the_adhd_company_at_089/gm7pcza/,0.0,0.918,0.082,0.891

267,GME, yeah im surprised its not jumping higher each day. Dont get me wrong the gains have nearly recovered from my dumbass buying GME against all fiber of reason at 280 so im not complaining. My guess is that all the subs have been spammed to death by bots and new users choking out discussion. Stocktwits has some action on the stock but actual twitter mentions doesnt have much. They did release a video today though.[https://twitter.com/AEZS\_inc/status/1357771995165970434](https://twitter.com/AEZS_inc/status/1357771995165970434),snarky_answer,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ldpkyb/would_love_some_perspective_on_aezs_is_it_a_pump/gm7b3wf/,0.084,0.818,0.099,-0.2011
268,AEZS," I typically use my phone when I'm on reddit. If you want to look a little further back, I was playing ARK.

Stocktwits comments seem to hype every stock.

Here's your DD, if you want it:

Stock is up 58% in 11 months, so it is gaining a few pennys a day as the weeks go by. I made \~50$ on AEZS this week by keeping some capital in it. Better than the interest on a savings account.

I haven't seen any indication that they are moving their Typhoid vector based oral vaccine along super fast, which was announced Tuesday for a \~30% stock jump. It isn't even in preclinical stages yet, so I don't think that catalyst is coming around the corner in the near term.

Their updates on the company website for their business profile were released in early January. I believe they just received an 180 day extension to stay on NASDAQ, so they need a few more days above $1.00.

Given market conditions, I think it will continue to mosey its way up, but I don't expect exponential growth given the current trends below the 4H chart cycle. I think the floor has been steadily rising, but the stock hasn't been tested too heavily since the \~\~30% stock jump on Tuesday.

&#x200B;

So yeah, if you want to park money somewhere waiting for your next move, you could probably expect to see the stock go up a few percentage points this week.

Allena Pharmaceuticals is a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company. It develops medicine used to treat patients with rare and severe metabolic and kidney disorders in the United States. It has a market capitalization of $91 million. The company was founded in 2011, and it is based in Newton, Massachusetts.

Five of the big Wall Street firms follow Allena. They include B. Riley, Cowen, H.C. Wainwright, Ladenburg Thalman and Wedbush securities. Even though Allena has lost money over each of the past four years, the firms all have it rated as a buy or strong buy. The average target price is $6.67.

Mustang Bio is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. It’s products include cell and gene therapies. The company was incorporated in 2015 and is based in New York City.

As you can see on the above chart, in the first half of 2018, shares of MBIO traded above $12. Then they went into a steep decline and closed out the year around $3. Since then they have traded in a range between $3 and $5 per share.

But that may be about to change. The brokers that follow Mustang are all predicting a breakout.

The are four firms that follow MBIO, and they all have it rated as a buy — B. Riley, Cantor Fitzgerald, H.C. Wainwright and Oppenheimer. The average target price is $11.20. If the shares rallied that high, it would be a gain of more than 145%. It’s at 4.66 now

ReWalk Robotics is a medical device company with very cool products. It designs and develops robotic exoskeletons for individuals with mobility impairments.

RWLK is currently a micro-cap stock. With the price at its current level, the valuation is about $56 million. It was founded in 2001, and the headquarters are in Israel.

The company has lost money over the past four years, but the size of the loss has been getting smaller. In 2016, it reported a loss of $32.5 million. In 2017, it was $24.7 million. The loss in 2018 was $21.7 million, and the loss for 2019 was $15.6 million.

As you can see on the above chart, in June 2019 the price almost reached $7 a share. It trended lower through last April and found a bottom around the $1.25 level. Since then, it has recovered some of its losses.

H.C. Wainwright is the only broker that covers RWLK. They have given it a buy rating with a $2.50 target price. That is about 10% higher than where its shares are currently trading.

They usually migrate to the OTC market and are quoted on the OTC.
