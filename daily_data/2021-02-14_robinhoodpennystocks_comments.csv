187,DD," Welcome and enjoy the stay. Like the guy said above, this place is filled with some of the nicest people you’ll meet in a community of almost +500,000. Just follow the rules, be kind back and do your own DD along with what they give you and you’ll do just fine. Also, always jump in the convo if you can give some solid info. We love to hear it. Some stocks miss and some hit. You just have to be okay seeing red some days or some week. Know when to pull on profit and when to be okay sitting if you’re holding on a longer play.

188,DD," Robinhood sucks ass at organization but I’m kind of an ocd fuck so I made due. I basically made 15-20 lists of all the sectors I’m super interested in. Whenever I find a stock on Reddit, screeners, Facebook or whatever the Fuck rabbit hole I’m in, I’ll do DD on it then organize it in one of the sector specific lists I created. But I also have two other lists that are my ‘primary’, I have the classic “medium to long holds?” And “bazingazinga” for whatever stock I think has potential of being a good reliable investment. It sucks ass and takes a decent amount of time, but it’s worth it. you can also hold and drag individual stocks inside of lists to rearrange them, or you can rearrange all your lists top to bottom by holding and dragging, if you didn’t know already. But good luck! Experiment with what organization method works best for you!",Bobdadrummer,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ljogiw/watchlist_organization/gnfitrr/,0.127,0.692,0.181,0.9039

193,DD," I dont set goals by time like that. If I'm pushing to make 20% a week or something, I might go looking further than I should for the trades to do that and could make riskier decisions later in the week. 

You need patience to find the opportunity to strike a certain stock. 

I know a lot of people aren't too keen on technical analysis. But when used properly and in conjunction with good DD, it can help you identify good entry points and sell points on your stocks.",platypusbelly,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ljb160/how_do_you_set_goals/gnc0eib/,0.063,0.769,0.168,0.8717

196,ZOM, What do you think is the future price of ZOM say in March? I am pretty optimistic about at a minimum $5 but maybe as high as 7-9 depending on if the hype is picked up by WSB.
