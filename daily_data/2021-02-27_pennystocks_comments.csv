95,VST," Currently we get our shrimp via 2 methods ocean trawling and existing open loop aquaculture facilities based mainly in APAC or India.

Ocean trawling – whats good is that these are wild shrimp. Whats bad is that there's a finite supply. In order to make the most of this finite supply trawlers have resorted to using ever larger nets. Larger nets means more bycatch and thats bad. But i'm sure you can see the issue here that would arise. If we Ash Ketchum all the shrimp then eventually we will actually catch em all.

Existing Open Loop Aquaculture facilities – The open loop part of this simply means that the ponds/locations where the shrimp are grown are connected to the open ocean. These have provided the lion's share of US demand for shrimp. The issue here is that shrimp need to eat a lot and if they eat a lot they need to shit a lot. Waste products are breeding grounds for bacteria and parasites. Farmers counter this by adding drugs and chemicals to the water which as you can imagine isn't the best for the environment. The other issue is that ocean connected real estate is also in finite supply.

As you can see, the existing methods are unsustainable and harmful for Earth.

Traditionally in shrimp farming the key difficulties are dealing with shrimp waste and also biosecurity. As with open loop systems, close loop farmers also use antibiotics and probiotics extensively to combat shrimp diseases and increase production rates. Typically farms have a 50-70% survival rate. NIS have achieved a 98% survival rate with their shrimp which needless to say is unheard of.

What makes NSI different is their VST which allows them to grow and harvest shrimp completely without chemicals or any genetic modification. Their tech allows them to just use salt, water, oxgyen and high class feed material which also helps reduce costs.",armored-dinnerjacket,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/ltcqlv/dd_on_shmp_part_1_market_for_shrimp_and_the/gox96lc/,0.077,0.886,0.037,-0.9241

No I think as google and all the rest have been in that space for a while so I wouldn't be surprised that they've not licenced a lot of the real research.

Watch ARK burn. It invests in high Beta stocks, when the market turns they'll get hammered, worse still funds will start being withdrawn and they'll need to sell down even more. They doubled down on Tesla last week, bad move. When Tesla is $500 and they're talking about moonshot $8000 they'll look like idiots. Classic hype in a bubble market. ARK and all the rest should be doing a Buffet type strategy and moving into currently undervalued defensive stocks. Take Rolls Royce which should x3 in value as airlines rebound, and that price will be achieved before Tesla x3.

Anyway, all and each to their own. The DOW will be 100k  I believe by close of 2030 so anyone with a decent basket of stocks is going to x3 by the end of the decade. (Loose monetary policy will inflate everything to there).",Actualise101,-1,/r/pennystocks/comments/ltjw1o/billionaire_investor_doesnt_know_which_is_worse/goyxyh6/,0.072,0.887,0.042,-0.8883

148,DD," Looks a bit fishy to me but I also am just getting started in doing my own DD on companies recommended through this subreddit. Taking a look at OTC markets, it shows their current market cap at 22 million, not 2.25 million.

Another thing that I must be missing is how only one year of their financials are showing up and only two quarters of financials are showing up. On OTC markets they are only showing financials for 2011 and June 2013. I’m still new to doing research but I assumed that they had to provide updated financials in order to remain pink on OTC markets. Could be something I’m missing.

Feel free to correct me if I’m wrong on any of this. It’s very possible I’m misunderstanding but did want to point out a few red flags for me.

Because I already hit my best case scenario...Now lets say it corrected and went way back down but it slowly climbed and EoY was 6 and I missed out on 1.88 a share. But I still gained insane profit in a short period of time and then in the remaining 10 months of the year that profit had a chance to make me more reinvested into something else. And even super long term investments if I have a chance to pull out initial investments I do. For instance Buy 40k of AAPL in March 2020 in August of 2020 that same 40k is worth 80. So I would sell off the initial 40k and ride the remaining for a very long time. Then that will take the slightest bit of emotion I could have left about the stock completely out.

154,OR," Yeah thats seems to be the general trend i am picking up on pennys here in my second week

But the thing is these little guys can go fast quick! So you might think ""oh this went up 100% let me sell"" only for it to go up 500%, hell I seen some stocks that go from trips to .0x were talking about 20000% ROI in matter of a few weeks.

I think as you said a safe bet is if you see ""parabolic gains"" which for pennystocks I'm not really sure what would that be 100% in a day? 500%? 1000% in a week? Then just pull out investment

But for me I have money invested that I can afford losing so I'm not emotionally attached to the dips but at the same time that's not to say I like leaving money on the table knowing we can crash in any minute 

My only thing is, if their is some sort of indicator that tells you ""hey this is going to go down any minute now sell your investment and wait for dip"" I would do it in a heartbeat as long as I believe in the stock and think its going to go up. I hate leaving money on the table, say I doubled my investment but I keep my position, but then my position dips, and even though I believe it will go back up, I hate the feeling of ""I shoulda sold and rebought here"" but really to make it simple on my self I can either try to learn technical analysis to see whats the best time to pull out and buy the dip OR if I am long say a whole year, then me pulling out is not going to matter in a year cos dips will happen regardless and I heavily believe in the time in the market vs timing the market

I am going to look into moving average, cos I personally don't like RSI and MACD cos something can be overbought but it can still go much much higher before coming down eventually. I think Moving averages might be better in my opinion but we can use all three indicators here to be honest to try to confirm

155,RSI," Yeah thats seems to be the general trend i am picking up on pennys here in my second week

But the thing is these little guys can go fast quick! So you might think ""oh this went up 100% let me sell"" only for it to go up 500%, hell I seen some stocks that go from trips to .0x were talking about 20000% ROI in matter of a few weeks.

228,GL," Most penny stocks are retail traded since institutions don’t/can’t invest. Retail traders don’t buy&hold like most institutions and are typically less disciplined so when a market swings down, traders flee to safer options which causes greater fluctuations.
