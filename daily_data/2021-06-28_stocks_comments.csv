24,TSLA," Was oil stocks for a little bit. Also REIT's but for different reasons.

When I started investing I swore off oil stocks and that I would ""vote with my money"" by not investing in companies I didn't want to support, and investing in quality companies that I think are doing good work (my first investment was TSLA in 2018).

That lasted a while until I saw a great opportunity in oil and I justified it to myself that it was okay to purchase. I never liked seeing it in my portfolio overviews though. I no longer hold any oil investments and I don't know that I ever plan to again. There's lots out there. 

REIT's I like the large dividends and relatively stable business. It's kind of a boomer stock and can be boring, I much prefer tracking developments in a growing business that I feel like I'm a part of. REITS just don't do it for me. But they sure pay. And it's a good form of real estate diversification for someone who owns no property yet.",thestonkinator,2,/r/stocks/comments/o97e4e/what_stocks_do_you_hate_but_they_make_money_anyway/h39zgu1/,0.09,0.718,0.192,0.9715

Google. Their shit sucks and never works. They are increasingly becoming like a corporate version of a Chinese propaganda machine. They started off as a great company that improved search and made life easier, now they are the opposite and make money by making searching harder and wasting your time to influence your behavior like an evil corporate propaganda machine. When you search now, you get garbage results and ""10 best who the fuck cares garbage"" They killed free dissemination of information and want to resurrect TV with commercials in Youtube format.

Both these companies treat you like a datapoint that means less than a dollar in their equation to make money and your happiness is used against you if it means more profits.

Apple. Microsoft. Planned obsolescence. Their updates kill your old products because they sell the software and the hardaware. They literally they charge you to turn on a feature. It costs them more to do that than to just give it to you except they can charge you more that way so now it doesn't. They convince you that is because development costs blah blah. It's not. It's sales and marketing 101. They don't invent as much new stuff as they make you think they do. They copy what is already been done but hasn't been adopted yet because they are the ones that control the market. When you get a feature they offer it's because they decided to buy out whoever discovered it after killing them with legal and market pressure. Or they stole it from open source developers and new companies taking actual risk to find helpful solutions.

144,FSD," tl;dr: When comparing manufactures you should only account for what they've officially released, not future tech they announced and are in active development. Once they release the new batteries and actually figure out FSD they'll be way ahead again. But for now a lot of large manufacturers have caught up with Tesla's current capabilities. 

>New 4680 batteries

Tesla's new batteries have been announce but **haven't gone into mass production or even implemented on a smaller scale yet**. The reason I didn't include this into calculating the gap between manufactures is because it hasn't started mass manufacturing. At the same time Tesla stressed that they're focused on creating a new supply chain to account for the increase in raw materials they'll need. 

Once they can reliably produce these batteries they'll be an entire generation ahead of the competition like they were ~5 years ago. But currently they're still not ready and we need to use what they current possess, not potential tech that'll help them in the future. 

>Which other auto manufacturer is even working on this? I think you are undervaluing what Tesla is doing here.

You're misunderstanding my point, I stated that Tesla's capabilities aren't anywhere near the goal they gave themselves. Their auto pilot is very impressive but it's current valuation is set at levels for full FSR not just advanced driver assist functionality. 

Also I would say the most comparable would be Mercedes, they've had a fairly good driver assist function back in the early 2000s. IIRC they were the first manufacture to include radars into their cars to help them track cars in front of them.

And IIRC they upgraded that driver assist function to also work at low speeds back in 2008. 

The only thing I see Mercedes lack is FSD which is available to Tesla owners through a **beta program**, which is why I didn't include it into the calculation. 

What I can say is that Tesla's driver assist is as advanced, if not a little more, than Mercedes and they offer it at relatively affordable prices.

162,SA," I can't really speak for any of the other stocks on there, but I was personally invested in Big 5. If they recommended it at $30+ they weren't pumping it. They had a huge earnings beat and a large gap up with 11 green candles in a row on the daily by the time SA was recommending it.

I personally sold most of my position around $30 but I'm letting a small amount ride through the summer as that was my original plan before the huge run up (bought at $17 price target was originally $25 conservatively and $30 aggressively). I think that it could be a $35 or $40 stock as their P/E is still low at ~7.",AbstrActivities,3,/r/stocks/comments/o9amua/what_if_you_bought_top_50_highest_rated_stocks_by/h3azxe8/,0.022,0.885,0.093,0.8126

248,CCS," Two stocks I’m about to add to my portfolio, I’m curious what people think. 

1. CCS. 

Short thesis: CCS has undergone massive growth in sales, profits, and cash flows while currently trading at p/e 7 and ps .8. There is a housing shortage right now, about 5.5 million homes. Wall Street forecasts home builders to do well and forecast this company to continue to grow. I already own Lennar and I’m gonna add a smaller amount of CCS. Stock price is way up over the last year but down 18% the last month. So it’s either a buy the dip or shitty momentum stock, pick one. I’m leaning toward it being a dip since overall momentum is still positive. 

Now, housing demand and prices will either slow down or decrease within the next year or two, I don’t expect crazy growth from CCS forever, but  at p/e 7 and p/s .8, they don’t need insane growth to be undervalued and a good buy. 

2. GRWG

This is a bit more of a gamble, it’s the so called Home Depot of weed, they sell growing equipment. Truly exponential growth in a growing market that has plenty of room for it to continue to expand into. The issue is it trades at 9 p/s and only recently became profitable.",loldocuments1234,10,/r/stocks/comments/o9gs5f/rstocks_daily_discussion_monday_jun_28_2021/h3b07vm/,0.062,0.769,0.169,0.9746

341,UK," Domestic USA air travel will continue to rebound, but it will be slower than many are reporting or expecting.  Several factors impacting this, including the rates for rental vehicles at destinations and hotel prices.

Kids are barely eligible for vaccines (12+ only) and the new variants do put them at risk.

Foreign travel will continue to lag.  Policies vary dramatically based on final destination and many USA to international routes are not restored.

410,RAD," Rite Aid beat the Q1 fiscal 2022 adjusted EPS number by a mile.  Like $0.38 per share versus analyst expectations of $0.22 per share.

Yet, the RAD stock price was knocked down almost 20% because, as indicated in the OP notes above, the CEO sandbagged the rest of the year (look at the assumptions she made --- was not even hiding the fact that she was sandbagging).

This gave shorts an opportunity to jump all over the stock.  The June 15, 2021 short report showed 8.93 million shares short.  That was up by 600,000 shares from the start of the month.  I wouldn't be surprised if the number of shares short now is close to 10 million.  And that does not even include dark pool shorting of RAD.

It's crazy --- the company turns the corner, beats adjusted EPS with a strong result, and the stock is crushed by a CEO who wants to give herself a low bar for the rest of the year and shorting hedge funds who were just looking for an oppotunity to continue driving Rite Aid's stock price lower.",Michael_Therami,3,/r/stocks/comments/o99mr2/rad_the_unbiased_information_you_need_to_make_a/h3a961h/,0.056,0.822,0.122,0.8727
411,RAD," Hi RAD employee here. Fiscal 22 bonus is set to be more rewarding than ever with 200+% incentives. For store and field associates. Fiscal 21 bonus was thrown away and all eliginle employees were given a 50% of base bonus. This included field and store associates.

Maybe sheds light on Heyward's bonus? 

But I will say there are many internal changes at the company that seem to be solely for appeasing the shareholder's and that is the sentiment around the company. These are thankless tasks that are not rewarding results but look good on newsreel. So this may play into your sandbagging notion.

This piece never referenced rite aids PBM elixir which is the main factor to me when assessing their value. The reasoning behind the lowered evaluation for year was due to decreased value in elixir due to a lowered reach in customer base and lower reimbursement rate for medicare customers.(this is the entirety of drug stores business).

Tldr.

413,ALL," Copying and pasting from an earlier conversation I had today:

Nvidia has a few CMP HX partner models preparing to launch - these are the mining specific cards. They have no display output which means they can't be used for gaming. Nvidia is also revising ALL current 30 series (except 3090 I believe) to a LHR (light hash rate) version which is a physical difference in the silicon. They are doing this to nerf ETH mining performance on their 30 series cards at the hardware level.

Currently, Nvidia's CMP HX mining cards make no economic sense to mine on since they are way less power efficient, and have no resale value since they can't be used for gaming. However, if Nvidia completely locks down ETH hash rate on the 30 series, they can increase their TAM by preventing miners from cannibalizing their gaming sales. So far, the CMP HX cards look like they are built on 10 series architecture so they will be able to be produced cheaper and in parallel to 30 series.

Lastly, the ARM deal seems to be moving along. Qualcomm has voiced concerns and said they are ready to invest in ARM as a partner if the Nvidia deal falls through. Nvidia says it has 3 other silicon manufacturers who support the Nvidia deal but details aren't known yet. Nvidia's recent rise is likely due to the probability of the ARM deal actually becoming more likely.

In case you dont understand why the ARM deal is good for NVDA, it means that all ARM-based chip manufacturers are beholden to NVDA. ARM is the most dominant CPU architecture for all mobile CPUs including micro controllers in other devices. Apple, qualcomm, samsung, amd, intel, huawei, IBM all have ARM licenses

It allows NVDA to penetrate the mobile market. Nvidia has the highest profit margins on their mobile CPUs because they don't have to rely on partners to distribute chunky desktop cards. They sell the silicon directly. Every iphone and samsung galaxy could have an Nvidia-produced CPU and GPU.

The reason ARM is used for mobile is because of its power efficiency. If Nvidia knows what they are doing (they do) then they know how they can use their proprietary access to ARM to create ultra performant and efficient server chips, feeding into their datacenter revenue.

Nvidia has announced plans to enter the server CPU market. When they announced this, Intel and AMD stock tanked 5% or so. My bet is that they are already working with ARM to deliver their CPU server chips

My understanding is if ET sells down to an amount that causes them to lose control of CRSR, this will make the company more attractive to institutional investors. Also, as the shares ET holds becomes less, sell-offs should have less of an effect on the price due to the increase in float.

485,NCLH, Yes they will absolutely survive until November.  No they will not recover to pre-pandemic highs anytime soon.  The main reason for this was share dilution.  To make sure they did not go bankrupt all of the major cruise companies issued new shares to raise money to pay for operating expenses while revenue was not coming in.  This diluted the value of existing shares.  I don't know specifically for NCLH but I believe all cruise lines were between 20%-40% diluted meaning being down 20%-40% is the same as the pre-pandemic highs because one share is a smaller part of the company now.  I also think that NCLH was the one that diluted the most but I am not sure.,imnotgood42,8,/r/stocks/comments/o9krsh/what_are_your_thoughts_on_cruise_line_stocks/h3busw8/,0.023,0.833,0.145,0.8982

513,IMO," Sounds like you're talking about short-term gains, which are taxed differently that long-term gains.

Short term gains (investments held less than a year) mean you have to pay ordinary income tax on those gains... which depends on your tax bracket, but usually about 25% is assumed.

If you hold an investment for over a year, then you only have to pay long term capital gains of 15%.

If you ""cash out"" that account at the end of the year, you'll be paying short-term gains at your ordinary tax rate based on ""where you end"". If you have a loss, then you'll get to deduct $3,000 every year until the total loss is written off. So if you lose $1,500, you'll write off $1,500, but if you lose $6,000, you'll write off $3000 this year and $3000 next year.

If you hold these investments for 366 days or more, then the same rules apply, but you'll only pay 15% tax on the gains.

Wash sales IMO aren't a huge problem unless you're playing with options. If you day trade options and have enough wash sales, it is possible to pay taxes on a loss... which is a real bitch IMO. Just don't day trade (buy and sell within 30 days) options unless you really do a lot of research and know what you're doing with these.",FOMO_HOMO_69,5,/r/stocks/comments/o9oesb/i_have_been_trading_stocks_frequently_the_past/h3c9uij/,0.111,0.803,0.086,-0.8018

552,IMO," https://www.barrons.com/amp/articles/fed-banks-stress-tests-buybacks-dividends-51624569663

| “The Fed said it expected banks to wait until after 4:30 p.m. on Monday to begin releasing their buyback and dividend plans. “This will give all firms sufficient time to examine and understand their results,” it said. Tens of billions are expected to be paid out to shareholders.”

So…after close today, we should see a wave of announcements from the big banks regarding dividends and buybacks. Buybacks will consolidate earnings and lift share prices IMO. 

Is this priced in? Maybe. But these banks trade at 8-12 P/E’s and are stable and can withstand a big market correction and economic downturn. They also have good dividends. 

I went long on about 20 FAS (3x leveraged financial sector ETF) deep in the money calls last week. Already up nicely after stress test results. And I expect positive movement after the announcements following market close today.
