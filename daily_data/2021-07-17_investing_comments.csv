0,IT," I saw this post, and among other things I started receiving marketing material for PPE in January/February, such as face masks etc.

One e-mail offered me an entire manufacturing line to make bulk face masks. I knew then that things were going to become very serious. The entire IT world was in DR prep mode because all the international companies with business continuity plans were buying up the available work-from-home hardware (laptops, docks, cell phones etc.)

International workers were reporting about new policies in China that would mitigate the spread of covid, like work-from-home policies and factory closures.

I sold 100% of my TFSA mutual funds to pay off some debt, thus locking in the pre-covid market prices. Then started a very very aggressive DCA back into my original savings position. The goal was to restore my savings in 1 year, which was reasonable since the debt payments were gone.

I didn't need to time the crash. I just averaged it out over the last 18 months and got excellent returns. All I need to do is beat the market over a few decades.",dinominant,1,/r/investing/comments/olvlki/proof_no_one_knows_anything_link_to_coronavirus/h5huk42/,0.069,0.874,0.057,-0.0424

4,SPCE," Those are probably the same people that still don't believe it's real now, and or the same people saying people are overreacting to the Delta Variant.

Not to mention that as long as it keeps spreading, it will keep mutating, and will keep this prolonged open/shutdown going. 

Add in inflation with wages stuck in the 90's - the middle class doesn't make enough to grow the economy, and when that happens, it's all downhill. The rich aren't growing the middle class anymore. 

Look at SPCE. They aren't even pretending this will ever be something that isn't solely for the ultra wealthy. I saw a headline that said, ""Virgin Galactic may have a use for normal people too"". Let me guess, jobs? Low paying jobs? Maybe serve them things while they wait to go up?

You look at the ape movement snd you can already see the tension rising between what has become a huge class system. And the middle class and the poor are getting angry that the system of wealth is not fair. People aren't angry cause they can't make money. Their angry cause the system is rigged. Their are different laws for the wealthy. 

People will take a lot of abuse. But everyone is becoming aware of how crooked this shit is, and that anger is growing... right as the financial system is about to collapse, and mutations are growing. 

It's about to get bad as the rich begin to hoard their wealth, thinking it will save them, keeping stocks down, crypto down, and falling, and in doing so will cause it to start sliding over the cliff.

There is only one thing that will save the economy - legalize weed... grow the economy, take money away from the cartels, add jobs, and have everyone chill the fuck out. Oh, and please do this before the next election, cause that's a tinder box waiting to go up. 

That's my 2 cents anyway...",Calcaniest,-1,/r/investing/comments/olvlki/proof_no_one_knows_anything_link_to_coronavirus/h5h6d69/,0.137,0.78,0.083,-0.944
5,GDP," Because it is.

Up until 2009 the Fed job was taming inflation, then it became propping up inflation because in their minds an erosion of people's savings would compel them to spend and invest opposed to hoarding dollars.

How is this different than a thief pointing a gun at your head and force you to do what they want?

Also leaving aside the morality of it...if you need to prop up inflation to show good economic metrics such as year over year GDP growth...is it really that different than China building bridges to nowhere just to make the numbers?

I've been holding that stock ever since and damned if they aren't solid on dividends. It's a slow growth too, but steady, they don't jump on every crazy ass scheme like AT&T and end up burning themselves (and shareholders) time and time again. They stay focused on their core competencies.

I think it's great to have in a portfolio to add in some stability (look at their chart, even COVID didn't do much to their stock when everything else crashed in Mar 2020). And of course the regular dividends are great and if you have this in an IRA I suggest just let them re-invest and continue to grow.

43,CM," CM.com 

A european version of twilio but including the processing of transactions and ticketing for events. 

Bull case - the beginning of this year cm has opened asia and american offices to accelerate global growth. The guidance is a growth on the mediun term of 50% per annum. The software platform is very scalable and expands in functionality continously due to M&A activity. Ticket sales and transactions will increase with lockdowns ending, driving profits. Cm is trading at 6 times sales (no net profit) versus 33x sales for Twilio. Cm will also be the head sponsor of the F1 grand prix in The Netherlands which will drive global marketing.

Bear case - twilio could go on a even greater cashburn and develop the advantages of cm. The expansion outside of europe could also not work out and twilio could expand into core markets of cm. CM does not make a profit at the moment.

Compass Pathways completed dosing in the world's largest clinical trial for a psychedelic drug in history on June 28th 2021: Phase 2B Psilocybin for treatment resistant depression. 216 participants, 22 sites, 10 countries. Patients will be doing follow ups for up to 12 weeks. Results are due by the end of 2021, my guess is October or November 2021.

Once the results of that trial show clinical significance, the entire psychedelic medicine sector will explode.

We already have the stunning results of MAPS Phase 3 MDMA for PTSD trials, which yielded a clinically significant reduction in symptoms for 88% of the active group. 67% of the active group no longer met the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis after the therapy.

85,NEE," Actually, I know this seems unintuitive but that would be their bull case! Public utilities are not normal companies as they are regulated monopolies...they don't make money by normal supply/demand dynamics. 

Every year they need to negotiate a fair market rate of return with their municipality, this RoR is computed as some % against their ""asset base"". 

For a utility to grow, they need to increase their asset base...and this is done via capital expenditures. Renewable investment increases that base and is more profitable to them than sticking with the status quo. 

Most utilities would love to triple down on investments, but it's up to whether or not the local government clears hurdles along the way and approves them (note this means approving cost increases as well). You have states like California as well where ""not in my backward"" is a hindrance towards grid building. 

Investing in renewables is how NEE has done so well: they've been able to win the political battle to invest and raise their asset base. My thesis is that over the next 10 years you'll see a bunch of the straggler states catch up, and that will help utilities that are still mostly in dirty energy.",cr0ne,1,/r/investing/comments/om9772/what_are_your_underappreciated_offtheradar_picks/h5jsm0t/,0.045,0.731,0.224,0.9919

96,UI," Long term inflation is a bad narrative with no real backing in the data anywhere.  


If people dont have more money in their pockets to spend, inflation will drop off. Stimulus is over and UI boosts end fully in September. Most companies are giving short term hiring bonuses and unions dont exist to make wage increases meaningful or lasting.  


The only reason inflation would run is if the government went to UBI or increased the min wage significantly.  


What is happening is that a lot of people are looking at \*only right this moment\*, panicking, saying inflation is going to be the end of the market and everything is gonna go down the tubes, while ignoring the underlying factors or long-term outlook entirely.  


Typical short-sighted monkey brain behavior coupled with the fear and panic that the threat of significant inflation hurting investments and the economy can induce. This has literally been a talking point every time a democrat has been elected going back to the early 90s. ""Government policy is gonna give more people more money and thats gonna cause inflation and we're gonna have to bail out the market and eventually full blown socialism/communism"" and yet every time, the democrat proves to be just another corporate crony who pushes the needle further in favor of large companies and the wealthy and everyone below the top 1% get a little poorer and worse off because of it.  


The ultra wealthy increased their fortunes by 40% during the pandemic and they dont spend money nearly enough to cause inflation, unless you're worried about the prices of luxury yachts and Planetary Escape Capsules™",EmojiKennesy,1,/r/investing/comments/om7k2e/ft_strange_bond_reaction_to_us_inflation_data/h5jybfc/,0.117,0.787,0.096,-0.8611
97,UI," The amount of government spending objectively is much less important to inflation than what happens with the money they spend. Unless those trillions are going directly into people's bank accounts like the stimmies did, it will not provide for lasting inflation. Even a government 'jobs program' is unlikely to create meaningful inflation because most of that money will get sucked up in supply costs, admin, and CEO pay for companies that already exist and have been working despite the pandemic.

The last time we had 'runaway' inflation was in the 70s which only ran so long because of wage inflation, i.e. more people broadly were making more money thus driving up the prices of all goods. In 2020, the stimulus money and UI checks together meant more people had more money broadly thus the price of things people buy went up, especially large purchases like cars and houses.

Increased UI is ending completely in September and, rather than a significant wage increase, we are seeing temporary and short-term hiring bonuses because companies know that as soon as people stop getting extra UI and their stim savings dry up, they'll be forced to come crawling back to low wage shit jobs because unions dont exist like they did in the 70s to make a meaningful wage increases possible.

Throw on top of this the fact that as supply chains continue to resolve, we will have an excess supply of goods precisely becauseof the short term inflation and supply chain backups. So by late 21/early 22 we're going to have a glut of goods finally making their way into an economy where people are close to or already out of all the stim money and returning to low wage jobs where they can barely squeak by and wont have excess wages to justify spending on all these new goods. The notable exception is in industries affected by the chip shortages (new cars, electronics) because those are at least somewhat unrelated to corona supply chain issues.

Long story short, we have to understand that inflation isnt purely driven by the government or governmental policy.

114,USA," 30M / USA / Income Aprox. $148,520 or $232,520 combined.

I am about to get significant amount of cash from 3 sources:

My brother and I bought a house in 2018 and will be selling it and closing on August 13th. My share is $42,485.

My wife and I bought a house in July 2020 and put it up for rent in May 2021. The renters were there for 2 months, broke their lease due to closing on a house and now owe us through September plus 1 extra month. Assuming a 1/2 month vacancy period (reasonable in this market), we will net $6,487.50.

My grandmother passed away in January and left an inheritance to all her grandchildren. We will be receiving the check my the end of the month. The amount is $10,000.

All of this will come in by September 1st and increase my cash holdings by $58,972.50.

We have several upcoming major events in our life. We are having a baby in December. We will buy another house ONLY IF my work sends me back home (currently traveling for work). Finally, we want to travel and spend some of the money for fun.

In most cases, I have a very high risk tolerance and have been aggressively dollar cost averaging in the NASDAQ and S&P 500 for 7 years now. It has paid off. I just don’t feel comfortable putting a large lump sum into the stock market right now since things seem so high. My total holdings in stocks is approximately $530,000.

Only large debts I have is the mortgage on the house we are renting out and my car which is $339,612.09 and $17,382.73 with interest rates of 3% and 2.85% respectively.

I have considered holding the cash and investing it into a 529 account when my baby is born. Holding some for a down payment on a house, but it could be 6 months or 2 years before we stop traveling for work. I have also considered paying off my car, but the interest rate is so low, so it might not be a good idea.

However, by 2020, it is falling slightly short of that target, with an estimated projection of total spending between $2 billion to $3 billion. Still, Shell is considered to be a leader in the clean energy sector.

BP has a long track record of operational transparency, and it routinely publishes sustainability reports. Even before its much-needed public relations campaign after the Gulf disaster, BP was championing its efforts to move ""Beyond Petroleum."" BP has pumped money into solar, wind, hydrogen, and other biofuel technologies. It's one of the largest renewable donors in the world. In its annual oil company rankings, activist group, Greenopia, placed BP in first place in 2008 and 2009. Greenopia is no longer active.

* Total is one of the largest oil companies in the world and owns a subsidiary by the name of Total Quadran. Formed in 2013 from a merger, Total Quadran's purpose is to provide access to renewable energy in the form of wind, solar, biomass, and hydropower. Total Quadran runs 11 wind farms and 35 solar plants. Total, with all of its subsidiaries, operates 300 renewable energy plants in France. It is committed to growing its renewable energy business, which can be seen through purchases of renewable firms, such as the Adani Group's solar portfolio for $510 million, and the development of new projects.

We won't. Because they don't know some secret. Their actions are in the open. *And all the big oils are investing in green* ***because the alterative is to slowly decline and die.***

* Shell has aimed to spend almost $2 billion a year on its ""New Energies"" division that it started in 2016. However, by 2020, it is falling slightly short of that target, with an estimated projection of total spending between $2 billion to $3 billion. Still, Shell is considered to be a leader in the clean energy sector.

* Prior to the terrible Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010, BP (BP), then called British Petroleum, was considered a very progressive company on climate change and alternative fuel research. BP has a long track record of operational transparency, and it routinely publishes sustainability reports. Even before its much-needed public relations campaign after the Gulf disaster, BP was championing its efforts to move ""Beyond Petroleum."" BP has pumped money into solar, wind, hydrogen, and other biofuel technologies. It's one of the largest renewable donors in the world. In its annual oil company rankings, activist group, Greenopia, placed BP in first place in 2008 and 2009. Greenopia is no longer active.

* Total is one of the largest oil companies in the world and owns a subsidiary by the name of Total Quadran. Formed in 2013 from a merger, Total Quadran's purpose is to provide access to renewable energy in the form of wind, solar, biomass, and hydropower. Total Quadran runs 11 wind farms and 35 solar plants. Total, with all of its subsidiaries, operates 300 renewable energy plants in France. It is committed to growing its renewable energy business, which can be seen through purchases of renewable firms, such as the Adani Group's solar portfolio for $510 million, and the development of new projects. Total is aiming for its renewable energy sector to account for 15% to 20% of sales by 2040.",zxc123zxc123,1,/r/investing/comments/olrlim/xom_what_does_exxon_know_that_we_dont_seem_to/h5jaluf/,0.025,0.9,0.075,0.9451
127,GDP," > You can just read the first page of the [Green New Deal](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/109/text) to see what the expected economic and physical damages are from the top intergovernmental agencies:

> That's about a 2.5% GDP impact and one city's worth of real estate in 80 years if we overshoot the report's expectation by 50% and nothing else changes.

The people who wrote those projections are either incredibly stupid or lie on purpose to keep BAU going.

But you, a random redditor who isn't paid to write these reports and spread this propaganda (at least I hope you are not a paid bot/troll), are simply incredibly stupid for believing and spreading that bullshit.

Here is just a small hint on how stupid or criminally misleading these ""top intergovernmental agencies"" are https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwwvZ8g5eHE",UpAndDownArrows,-1,/r/investing/comments/olrlim/xom_what_does_exxon_know_that_we_dont_seem_to/h5ihrrt/,0.201,0.765,0.035,-0.98
128,GHG," At this point, I think we have to carbon capture the crisis away.

My off-the-cuff remark about the Arctic is a reference to a severe problem of the Arctic behaving more and more like the tropics each year.

Realize, the tropics are a steady approximately \~80deg F. Maybe 90deg F depending where you are.

Siberia hits the 80F range longer and longer each year...so does parts of Canada and Alaska.

You can see this by their seasonal NO2 productivity rate which dramatically starts increasing earlier in the years. Showing methanogenesis in full swing.
