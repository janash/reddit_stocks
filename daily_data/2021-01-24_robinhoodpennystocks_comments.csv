Also, shares of Altimmune skyrocketed after positive results from preclinical trials https://finance.yahoo.com/news/altimmune-university-alabama-birmingham-uab-110010132.html why can’t Atossa follow the same path? Altimmune raised lots of money through offerings (more than 200m) after hitting all time highs, so it still needed fundings, since they were Public Offerings. And I wouldn’t call it a pump & dump, since Atossa’s CEO has probably one of the strongest background in the game. Many many companies struggle with profitability, but is it an aspect to consider in this Bull market? If you say it’s a pump and dump because of the balance sheet, would you have touched Amazon back in the days when it was 17 years in-a-row unprofitable? (not trying to compare AMZN with ATOS, but first principles). A bit extreme calling it a p&d, don’t you think?

I believe that this will force the company simply to apply for a loan or to do further public offerings in the future, both of which should be seen as negative catalysts by current shareholders. Also, while Atossa's CEO has been regularly praised in these posts I see no reason that a company of Atossa's size can reasonably compete against other much larger companies in the same field - working on the same products. Only thing that has some silverlining to ATOS is that their product's, main, possibly 'revolutionary', driver is Endoxifen. And I have to further weigh on this; even if Atossa manages to invent and produce its own nasal spray for covid et cetera, the likelihood of the product being much costier than those of its competitors', that have governmental funding, also due to its own currently lacking financials is in my mind of high propability.

The downvotes I've got here so far, for trying to present dissenting ideas on a company, only reinforce my suspicions about a bubble that investors here don’t want to burst prematurely.

Really though, if you just do a bit of research into every ticker you see posted on reddit eventually you’ll be early to the train. I saw one person post about ATOS last week and then I looked into the company and realized I was getting the stock on sale. Compare the market cap to a similar company, look at their finviz, look at their historical charts, check whether they recently had any offerings and what happens to their chart when they do. You’ll start to see patterns. I was obsessed researching the last two weeks and it put me in a good position to ride out the beginning of this coming week.

Also, 15% in two weeks is great. People are happy to make that in a year. Just keep your eyes peeled for the next big move. You never know if the ticker you’re looking at is the next one. Do your OWN research and it’ll help you hold during the dips.",0.02,0.875,0.105,0.9545

There’s not many stocks under $1 on RH. I was ok with it at first, but there are so many others out there to look at. I keep seeing them but RH doesn’t have them.

I did some research on CTRM and other than them taking offers, I think they’ll do well. I got in at .33, then some more at .36. People hate on it, but look at the CEO.

45,DD,"I’m new too and here are a couple things I learned this month

1. Confident posts do not equal smart investments. If you think someone is onto something do some research and find multiple sources or verify their DD before investing.

2. Don’t pull money just because there’s a dip at some point. There’s tons of learn about stocks and if you invest in something you’re confident in you won’t be scared when there’s a dip from an offering etc. 

3. If you made money you won. Don’t get caught up in what the stock did after you left unless you plan to reinvest. If you spend your time worrying about the unicorns you could have had you won’t have time to enjoy the profits you made.

4. Have fun. I am loving the learning and investing journey. I try not to compare myself to others and just celebrate when I see a huge win for someone else. If we invest with knowledge research and sometimes a bit of a gamble we will net positive.

218,TSE,It's not technically listed on the U.S. stock exchanges. O.T.C is over the counter. In the case of BDRBF or NTDOY you're routing your purchase of the underlying through an intermediary to buy the underlying on its home exchange CSE or TSE in this case. As a rule of thumb OTC bets are a bit riskier because generally companies that aren't listed on U.S. exchanges have a higher than normal potential to go bankrupt. I'd argue that to a lesser extent Bombardier and certainly Nintendo are two exceptions to that rule.,0.09,0.885,0.026,-0.7184

I am getting out of the US, just listed my house for sale.  Some of my money i will save in bank account and others I will put into stocks that are safe.  And maybe a small bit I will use for pennies.  I won't need the USA ever again but age 62 once I reach it, I'll get the SSI to kick in lol.  Or I may get it earlier than that.

I’m thinking that it’ll go up when Biden starts working with China More. As we need more masks (like from ITP and other Chinese companies) it has to get here somehow.

No reason for it to really spike unless it gets a bit of a squeeze. 

I noticed it had a huge spike on volume though. I’m still too new to know what that’s all about.",0.066,0.911,0.023,-0.6604

411,CEO,"Honestly that’s all I’ve really looked at it though. People have issues that they take offerings randomly.

The CEO just doesn’t have PR skills I think. He doesn’t have a LinkedIn, the website is good but basic, idk.

It could just be a guy with 7 rafts. Lol. Try to do some more DD if you can. 

But they also have to do the $1 for over 180 days thing or they get the boot.",0.021,0.879,0.1,0.7227

BB and SENS are definitely getting some love tomorrow, I may just focus on those two the most since they have the most promising long term gain and are somewhat low at the moment. Thanks for the input!",0.044,0.639,0.318,0.9783
