Compare the market cap to a similar company, look at their finviz, look at their historical charts, check whether they recently had any offerings and what happens to their chart when they do. You’ll start to see patterns. I was obsessed researching the last two weeks and it put me in a good position to ride out the beginning of this coming week.

Liver elastography is also a thing and has been used to quantitatively measure liver tissue characteristics for years, and it does so in real-time without having to switch probes. The promotional videos make this product's tech seem way further along. It cannot be used simultaneously with b-mode ultrasound. You have to find an adequate window, mark it, then switch over to the special TAEUS unit, then compare the data to the ultrasound to make sure the readings correspond to the different tissue layers on ultrasound. With elastography you use a standard ultrasound probe and press a button.

EDIT: Also the TEAUS probe itself is huge, and looks double the size of a standard curved abdominal probe. So to get this tech to the point where it can actually be used with ultrasound in real-time it (and current ultrasound probes) need to shrink considerably. I'm not even sure if it's actually possible given that the piezoelectric crystals in modern ultrasound probes are lead zirconate and how that would work with this technology, which uses RF.",0.011,0.913,0.076,0.9219

Here's what I see going down: after the market crash of late 2021/early 2022 retail traders get virtually wiped out. We piled all our eggs into crypto, EVs, renewables, and pennies and all of them go tits up. Our nest eggs that we've built for ourselves are gone. To protect us from ourselves the government makes new laws about online forums bring insider trading, they say it's too easy to manipulate the plebs and they crackdown on reddit stock communities and maybe even arrest some of the big WSBers for insider trading. My guess is they'll outlaw retail traders from options and will pass a rule prohibiting retailers from trading stocks that are below a dollar (for our own good of course). The GME short squeeze has pissed off way too many traditional investors... You can get away with scamming a bookie, but eventually your gonna get your kneecaps busted.
