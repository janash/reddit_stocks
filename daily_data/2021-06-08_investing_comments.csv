5,ID," So it was originally set to expire on in January of 2018, but they amended it to be pegged to the life of some random individuals instead, which bought them another 100 years? And that’s why you think no amendments would be allowed? 

I’m not a lawyer, and only know about this in relation to retirement, but my understanding is that “irrevocable” is more about the restrictions placed on the grantor. So, if you’re setting up an trust for your heirs, and you decide to transfer over $x. With a revocable trust, you could change your mind and transfer that money back, or generally use it however you like. It’s still your money, you’re just earmarking it to be a part of the trust that will be created when you die. With an irrevocable trust, once transferred, it’s no longer your money in any sense of the word. The trust has its own unique tax ID number, files its own taxes, and is essentially like a corporation on its own. But they can still be modified if all the beneficiaries and the trustee agree, and a court agrees that the change is in line with the original intentions of the trust.",IBetThisIsTakenToo,3,/r/investing/comments/nuw5l3/the_lifespan_of_spy_depends_on_the_lifespan_of_11/h11atkg/,0.045,0.738,0.216,0.9913

This follows a mixed but muted Monday. Small caps had a good day, with the Russell up 1.4%. Tech rallied a bit as well (Nasdaq +0.5%). Large caps were off a bit, with the S&P and Dow down 0.4% and 0.1%, respectively.

Meme stocks are where the action is. AMC and Blackberry both popped by double digits. Peloton was up 7% but not sure if that’s a meme stock. Biopharmas rallied, led by Biogen (up 38% on approval of its Alzheimer’s treatment).

57,GME," Hi all, I think this is a question that is general to the stock market, but I haven't been able to find a straightforward answer. It came up due to everything with Citadel and GME. I tried making this a post but it was rejected. Also, if there is a subreddit better suited for this question, please feel free to refer me there.  
  
Maybe you know, but on one of the GME subreddits, they have been doing AMAs with a few experts on Naked Shorting, and it had me thinking, who actually knows all of Citadel's shorts (or any market participant).  
  
From what I can see, short positions are required to be reported to FINRA, which is then released to the public. But there are also cases where market participants have been fined for misrepresenting the data they submit, and usually this happens years after the fact. So, if I'm not mistaken, it's just an honor system, to report your short positions accurately or pay a small fine down the road if you get caught. If it takes years for FINRA/SEC to realize that short positions are inaccurate, then that means the regulators do not actually know in real time the short positions held by market participants.  
  
So my question is, who does know? For example, for Citadel, they have to go to a broker to enter a short position (correct me if I'm wrong): does this mean that the only ones that know Citadel's shorts are Citadel, and each of Citadel's brokers (in part)? I'm assuming it is in each broker's best interest to keep track of who owes it money.  
  
This has me thinking, who enforces that stocks have to be paid back? Can the brokers just agree to forgive Citadel, if GME's price does indeed get out of hand? If there really is as much corruption as some of these AMAs are suggesting, could the financial institutions involved just agree to maybe do some illegal bookkeeping and Citadel just pays them some agreed amount of money? Because the regulators don't even seem to know how many shorts there are. And that would be preferable than having to expose something that has been making money for all parties involved, not just Citadel.",-theSmallaxe-,1,/r/investing/comments/nv0dyg/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h12olt4/,0.032,0.844,0.125,0.9906

Yeah, the price of the option can move based on demand-  this is effectively expressed as IV changing.  As in if a price continues to increase while the underlying does not it's assumed that the IV is increasing

>It seems this is similar to a situation where an ETF's share price becomes greater than the NAV price. I know there are mechanisms in place to address that when it occurs.

Not at all.  A call option is the right to purchase shares in the future, that is only tangentially related to the current price of a share.

An ETF's NAV is it's real time underlying value so if the price fluctuates away from that in a meaningful way authorized participants are able to create/redeem ETF shares for the underlying in order to maintain efficiency.

94,APPS," question on my portfolio, looking for some feedback/advice. 

36, just started investing a few years ago, wife and I are both employed making around $125k a year, the objective with the money is to just put it away and keep adding to it monthly for retirement.  

I have a Roth and a Taxable account, my issue is I just dumped a bunch of speculative holdings in my Roth which at the time I thought were good investments but turns out they weren't. So I took a 4 fund approach to the Roth and I thought it was MAYBE correct? But after reading some today, it may be better if they were in the Taxable account.  

the holdings are, FDEWX, FTIHX, FXNAX, FSPGX.  It seems more low and slow index funds may be better off in a taxable account?  per not being high for tax advantages. 

In my Taxable account there are a APPS, VTI,VEA,VWO which I attempt to contribute to them monthly. more so the last 3.  In the taxable though I thought I would try to build up a dividend position and got carried away thinking more = better monthly return. 

REIT - STWD, ARR.  Nat resource - CNQ.  and then 3 financial sectors GAIN,GLAD, MAIN, which I think main and gain are close to the same, so closing one and putting that money into the other may be better suited. 

My concern is that in the taxable it seems is kinda junk besides the VTI, VEA, VWO and APPS. And it would be better suited to the index funds that I mentioned I have in the Roth. While putting better high yield Div ETF's like VYM, SCHD, HDV would be better to put in the Roth and get rid of the other dividend stocks I currently have to fund the others. 

Would it be worth while to sell all in each except for the few and set up the Roth and Taxable accounts differently? almost swapping the holdings.

117,DD," 100%, I forgot to add in my OP that it requires a ton of DD to be successful in any collectible flipping. Doing it with something you're passionate about in the first place definitely helps. I don't know two shits about comic books so would never get into them but that's another that can have huge upside for example. YMMV

What I've always have had success with is only buying shit from random everyday places like yardsales, flea markets, rummage bins at Walmart for HWs when knowing what to look for versus dealing with anyone with any knowledge. It's like spot prices - you'll always lose money with someone who knows what they're dealing with.",YourFriendlyUncle,1,/r/investing/comments/nuptbz/investing_in_physical_goods/h0zm7z6/,0.064,0.752,0.184,0.9198
118,TRQ," I've owned IVN since 2018 with a cost basis of $2.45/sh and it has performed great for me. 

The mine has been hitting all it's metrics on time and the management seems to be very competent. As you said, the size of the deposits they sit on and the high quality make it very enticing.

The largest drawback is that they operate in the DRC but with the amount of locals they employ and the money they bring to the government, I see them as a stabilizing force.

If they continue to hit their metrics, get the mine fully operational and the geopolitical risks don't interfere, I can see this stock going to $50+.

Another mine I am bullish on is Turquoise Hill Resources ($TRQ). 

They operate in Mongolia and are similar in scale/quality to IVN. 

There are risks involved with that as well: Government of Mongolia wanting more money, China not wanting Mongolia to have more financial indepenced/ties to the west, Rio Tinto wanting more control/stake in the project, development costs for the mine have gone up significantly so TRQ is scrambling for funding.

 I think these risks are overblown and the share price is depressed because of it.",Teslatroop,2,/r/investing/comments/nv1i6a/ivanhoe_mines_tier_1_copper_deposit_vs_south/h10pipn/,0.06,0.893,0.047,-0.5579
119,WPM, I ran ivn though my spreadsheet and it was negative return but I could be wrong try WPM instead because ivn is not very easy to find information on it and wpm is a highly profitable bussiness,TheWealthyNidus,1,/r/investing/comments/nv1i6a/ivanhoe_mines_tier_1_copper_deposit_vs_south/h10kp1l/,0.225,0.678,0.097,-0.6853
120,CSV," You can download a historical CSV for any equity from the Nasdaq website's stock screener. It will give you the opening and closing prices of that equity for each trading day within a date range. Just load and manipulate it in Excel like other people have suggested.

Obviously, you have to apply some logic and understand basic math to arrive at your solution: by first creating an output column for each daily record (also known as a trading day or a row of data) that has a value of ""yes"" or ""no"" based on a formula that evaluates whether (closing - opening) is greater than 1. Then, you can calculate the proportion of ""yes"" to the number of records/trading days/rows of data.

I don't think there are any free apps or websites that provide this level of manipulation or data extraction in a user-friendly interface (which is probably what you want). You can try the Nasdaq or Morningstar websites.",riches2rags02,2,/r/investing/comments/nvaaqt/is_there_a_tool_for_telling_what_of_days_a_ticker/h12icz7/,0.014,0.867,0.12,0.936

122,CSV," So I realized after reading your question again that all you need is the Nasdaq stock screener for CSV data and Excel to add the (closing - opening) column to achieve your solution. Forget the programming method. I even deleted it from my original post.

124,MS," Depending on how far back you’re going you can just download raw data in xlsx from yahoo for a lot of stuff - just navigate to historic prices.  You can definitely get it from Morningstar too but ya might need one of their paid subscriptions - I’m honestly not sure if we pay for their web premium or not, I just log in and download the stuff I need.  We also have direct and Bloomberg too so I don’t use it a ton.  I run these exact calcs on indexes once a year for some newsletter work, I use MS direct though since it automatically runs in to the spreadsheets.

125,API," You are correct that automated data analysis with large, real-time datasets and algorithmic trading is ultimately better with an API platform and a programming language like Python. Wall Street quants don't rely on Excel in the way that non-quant analysts do.

However, it sounds like the OP just wants to perform simple, one-off analysis of a few equities. A stock screener providing a historical CSV and Excel is the quickest and easiest method. OP is not into programming/scripting either.",riches2rags02,1,/r/investing/comments/nvaaqt/is_there_a_tool_for_telling_what_of_days_a_ticker/h12sn8j/,0.059,0.815,0.126,0.6946

127,IMO," Yeah I mean I don't use spreadsheets or python to do any financial analysis, but if I wanted to do something I am certainly more familiar with excel than python. The other commenter isn't wrong in that it can be done with python, I'm just putting myself in OP's shoes and their question seems easy enough to figure out with just a spreadsheet, which I'm guessing more people are familiar with anyway. Maybe it will take an extra five minutes, maybe not, it's kind of trivial IMO.",semipalmated_plover,2,/r/investing/comments/nvaaqt/is_there_a_tool_for_telling_what_of_days_a_ticker/h12h54u/,0.017,0.81,0.173,0.9402
