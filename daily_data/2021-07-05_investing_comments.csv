But you could literally see as an outsider that when he made his first stock and/or Tesla video (ideally both), it garnered a shit-ton more interest and within two weeks he forgot about real estate and made his Jim Cramer-like flashy setup.

Also he started BEFORE covid investing in Tesla just like many others like Cathie Wood (bit crazy) and Ross Gerber (advisor since the 2000s) so has something good ideals to follow. 

Too many videos but he’s pretty accurate so far. He bought the tech dip in May and posted his purchases in Discord and announced it on stream so he’a transparent. He also mentioned he “lost” a million dollars in value in his WeBull as Tesla dips.

If i had bought when he bought id be up 50%. If i had bought when Ross Gerber said “Tesla under $600 is a good start” id be up 15%.

FYI do you even know what you’re talking about? The writing was and is on the wall. It’s going to be an EV future. Literally, innovation is always on the horizon. No one expected 2020 to cause the stock to moon but it was going to happen regardless. Vertical integration has huge capex but can have monopolistic advantages. Late 2019 Tesla began to scale ending a major bear case. 2020 delivering nearly 500,000 cars. A major feat for a NEW PLATFORM mass market vehicle. Ford made 10,000 in 1909 and 1,000,000 in 1920 (Wikipedia). It still takes time to retool a factory but it’s all similar parts and ideas so millions can be made a year. 

Your statement is dismissive and ignorant because you can literally say that about anything. “Just because something happened doesn’t mean they were right.” You can say this about u/DeepFuckingValue too. What about all the people who sold in March 2020? “Just because they sold in 2020, it doesn’t mean that they don’t know what they’re talking about?” How about Cathie Woods? Ross Gerber? He mentioned in a recent forum that he was one of the last of his institutional group to stay in Tesla. Ron Baron? Baron only had to sell Tesla to rebalance his fund’s portfolio. He personally invested in it so long ago and still believes it can go even higher.  Who am I to argue with people who are making money? I know the risks. We know the risks. Investing is all about risk management.

43,UK," I'm a UK investor so things are a bit different.  

Firstly dividends are far more common in the UK markets. There is less of an opportunity loss by picking dividend stocks. 

Next you have a tax incentive to buy dividends as well as growth stock. Dividends don't count as capital gains, and you have a £5k tax free limit on dividends alongside your £12k tax free limit on capital gains. 

So if I make £12k a year growth, and £5k a year dividends I won't pay a penny in taxes. 

Then you have the fact that British Dividends are higher yield and more stable than American dividends (on average), which means you don't need to expose yourself to foriegn currencies to get good returns. 

In the UK I would recommend 50% of your portfolio is focused on dividends while 50% is focused on growth.  Even if you don't reinvest,  the dividend stock is a stable asset much better than holding cash in a checking amount and less risky than growth stocks that boom and bust.",Bendetto4,3,/r/investing/comments/oe5mmd/high_dividend_etfs_have_been_a_bad_investment_so/h457edi/,0.019,0.713,0.268,0.9917

50,CRSP," Most of the ETFs you listed aren't ""bad"" investments compared to total-market. Some of them are on par with total-market and others lagged behind but still provided good returns. Past performance doesn't guarantee future returns yada yada yada.

SCHD 5-year return is 17.26 vs VTI's 17.39

VIG is 15.99 for 5-year and 10.01 since inception vs VTI's 8.88 (keep in mind that VTI was created 5 years before VIG)

VYM 5-year is 12.18 and 8.64 since inception (2006).

Point is some of these aren't bad investments and in the case of SCHD and VIG you would have gotten very similar returns to total-market. And this only accounts for the ETFs and not the indexes, Don't quote me on it but I believe the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100™ Index(SCHD) outperformed the CRSP US Total Market Index(VTI) since like the early 2000s or something.

60,FB," Have you tried to map out Shopifys revenue until 2025, then estimating a share price with a price to sales or pe ratio slightly above FB today (to capture better growth opportunities)?

Im currently up 20%, despite the seemingly horrendrous price to sales ratio. 100% revenue growth and exponentially growing profits can do this. 



You're first sentence sounds right, but you're not taking into account the non-normal distribution of equity returns, with an extreme skew in the right tail end. 4% drive about 50% of returns, and a small minority of these 4% drive a large share of this 50%. This is the Amazon and Apple of companies. Companies that can drive consecutive 30%+ revenue growth. Holding these for a long period of time har more upside than holding dividend companies and is the holy grail of equity investing. 

The challenge is of course to identify the right growth companies.

67,FSD," I think that. Alot of people are just comparing them to companies like ford, and for good reason as they are currently looking like a car company at face value, but they are so very different. They have a lot of focus to bringing as much in house as possible, opposite to today's business model. I think this is an advantage. Their R&D with in house manufacturing is huge bonus. Really allows not only good flow between other departments but inspires research as they can really follow through with their vision. Also battery Tech. Yes there are other companies, but again, in house they have already patented a better battery than on the market. And  one thing I know everyone bashes on is the FSD, it's a work in progress still and people say they would never pay for an unfinished product or what not. But they are taking it on, and doing better than any other company in the world. All the other companies will most likely outsource this once Tesla nails it and everyone wants it. Maybe another company will first but I don't think it will be any major car company. It will be like chosing a streaming service when you buy your new vehicle, would you like Tesla FSD, BlackBerry, Google? Not sure who else has their hat in that race. VW CEO did an interview in 2018 or something where even he said that Tesla was decades ahead, because the entire structure of the car companies needs a complete overhaul and no one wanted to be the CEO who cause earning crashes to overhaul the company. Granted we are starting to see some of this with Ford, and others but I am very curious how they will compare when actually stacked against each other.

Always with a declining marginal cost curve. Hence operational profits grow exponentially. Just like what happened to Google, FB and Amazon. Meanwhile they'll continue to reinvest dramatically, expanding the business vertically and horizontally (e.g. into logistics) which gives them a huge moat. 

Shopifys subscription service is their AWS. It is a cash flow business without a peer. 70 or 80% operational profit growing at 100% is probably more or less unlike any large manufacturing company ever. By a fair margin..

Youre looking at shopify like your looking at a car manufacturing. Id argue that's completely wrong. As SAAS, their marginal cost is close to zero.

84,REI," > I believe we are due

What I found fascinating is that when Covid hit and businesses were shutting offices down left and right, a lot of people predicted that commercial real estate would take a nosedive. And for good reason, too.

For example, REI had built out a completely customized headquarters and, facing a global pandemic, they decided their entire work model was changing. They sold the building - in the height of the pandemic and before it even really opened - when the world was crashing around them.

At the time, there was no timetable for when a vaccine would be developed. Entire downtown metropolitan areas were shuttered. So who was going to buy the REI building?

Facebook, that's who. And not at a bargain either. REI actually made a healthy profit on that sale, despite all the chaos and turmoil.

And the cost has continued to rise since then. It hasn't missed a beat. So I've completely given up on trying to predict when the next correction will come.

93,DD," Hi! 

I was wondering what people do for their DD. Sort of like a template of sorts. I'm just a 30-year old software engineer that finally paid off their debts and when I see some of the extensive DD posts on reddit, I feel a little overwhelmed.   


What I currently do is as follows:

1. **Check their website.**   
A company with a shitty website tells me it's a company that doesn't care about their image or if they refuse to pay for one, signifies an aversion to tech.
2. **Check out their location through streetview.**  
something someone suggested on reddit a couple months ago.
3. **Check their product/services**  
Would I buy this? Check reviews for the products, company, etc.  
4. **Check their job offers**  
is this company always looking for new workers? How many openings are there? Is it growth? or is it that they can't keep their employees?
5. **Read some news articles if available**
6. **Look at the stock price graph/growth** 
7. **Look at basic financials**  
profits, volume, 
8. **Investigate the amount of astroturfing surrounding this company.**  
Check out social media, yahoo, reddit to see how many comments and posts are trying to tear down/uplift the stock.

I feel it's pretty basic so I was wondering what more I could do. FYI I'm still pretty new to this. I started in January and some of the terminology is still new to me.",Native136,2,/r/investing/comments/oe39tn/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h44u1xx/,0.058,0.865,0.077,0.7669

98,DD," I'm not big on doing extensive DD, but I'll play devil's advocate on some of your points:

1. Many companies don't care about their image, this almost says nothing about their value.  In fact, there are many shit companies that just spend a lot on marketing to pull in people who don't know any better.  I think as a software engineer, you may have tunnel vision on this one.

2. What does their streetview have anything to do with value?  If a manufacturing company buys cheap land in a shitty area, how would that make them less valuable?

3. First, reviews are usually limited to tangible consumer products, you are excluding all B2B and most of the intangibles, which is most of the market.  And even for consumer tangibles, reviews can be very misleading (e.g. knockoffs, fake reviews, misattribution).

4. Lots of openings can mean growth, but it can also mean turnover.  You also have to take into account company size and type of business, some run with less overhead.

5. Your mileage may vary, lots of financial news articles have conflict of interest.

6. The graph is just historical data, which doesn't tell you anything about future return.  The technical analysis people will disagree of course, but proper tech analysis can't be done at a glance.

7. This is easily the most valuable thing on your list, possibly the only one.

8. Again, says more about marketing budget and outside interest than whether or not the company will actually do well.",jammerjoint,1,/r/investing/comments/oe39tn/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h45b0pq/,0.131,0.767,0.102,-0.8586

100,CD," Depends on how much that dream house will cost and risk tolerance: (and don't just say my risk tolerance is sky high, very few people actually do have that and it gets them into trouble)

1. Debt is a safe investment, far safer than the stock market. Even if the car debts are under 3%, say 2.7%, that is an after-tax value. I.e. paying that off saves you 2.7% on the money that you would receive after taxes. So if your tax bracket is say 22%/24%+3% for state and local, that means only 75% of your income after working could actually pay off that debt, it accrues on the taxed side of things. So 2.7% / 0.75 = 3.6% effective return on that ""investment"" of paying off loans early. 
   1. It's also guaranteed. 100% chance of a 3.6% return. The stock market doesn't provide that at all...
2. Now about those student loans... They turn on in October or are already accruing, probably at 4-5% rates. Same thing as before: it's 4-5% / 0.75 = **5.5-6.5% guaranteed return.** Whatever you decide to do, please put something into these debts. it's effectively a much better stock/bond portfolio because your bonds are risk free. So I would be leaning 50% of the money paying these off.
3. But the amount of money you should invest should be determined by a few different moving parts:
   1. Is your house going to be on the market any time between now and 4 years, or will it only appear in 3-4 years and you can do whatever you want with the money for 2-3 years?
   2. Is your house going to need a 20% down payment of 50-80K? Or is it going to be more like 40K or 200K? That should be your target amount in ""cash equivalents"" in 3-4 years. 
   3. What about income in the meantime? Should you just lump sum invest now and let your income accrue back to the amount you need over the next four years? I.e. drop your account to 10K, and save 10K a year back to 40-50K for that down-payment.

As you can see there's a lot going on here, but I would push you to think a bit differently about your situation, to see debt in a much better light than you want to admit, not invest all the money in the stock market with such a near term need of a large lump sum, and to do a balanced investment portfolio, say 40-50% in your highest interest rate debts, 40%-50% in total market ETFs, and 10-20% in your ""higher risk"" plays. 

&#x200B;

But please please don't put it into the stock market because you see it as more liquid. If you think the dream house will appear and be reasonably priced, it's likely when the market has recently crashed, so you suddenly can't pull that money out... 

Finally, CD's do exist. You could drop some of this into a 2-3 year CD, but that's a much worse investment than paying off debt early....",exe_virus,1,/r/investing/comments/oe39tn/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h461hym/,0.052,0.841,0.107,0.9762

Selling $500 of stock every quarter would cost you $35-60 in trading fees what is like 10% fees. Collecting a dividend was a free way to sell and bi-pass trading fees.

119,ROIC," If you’re doing a quick and simple scan, EBITDA minus Capex is generally a decent cash flow proxy. Depreciation isn’t free so taking capex into account helps solve part of that issue. 

Take each metric with a grain of salt and understand its flaws. 

EBITDA typically is filled with adjustments you may not agree with (ie recurring vs. non recurring, poor management mistakes that may repeat vs. actual one-off occurrences). 

Capex can be thought of as replacement capex vs growth capex.

EBIT has non-cash charges incorporated that are largely a function of accounting (ie D&A), even if they do provide some tax shield. This skews how profitable a company is.

If possible, I’d take a look at a company’s Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) which can be a proxy for how strong their moat is. Higher ROIC means a company can reinvest capital at a very high rate and continue creating value.

In conjunction, I might also look at levered free cash flow yield. So this is your free cash flow after paying down debt and interest, divided by the market cap. This will give you a sense of how expensive the company is on a yield basis (i.e. 10mm in LFCF / 1000mm market cap = 1% yield. You must have a very high ROIC and growth opportunities to make this worthwhile, otherwise a 1% yield is very low).",Funky_Smells,0,/r/investing/comments/oe94nb/which_type_of_profit_in_an_income_statement_is/h451w10/,0.05,0.792,0.158,0.976

123,AMD," Have you opened up a roth ira? I would do that if I were in your shoes. Then max the annual contribution to it. I have VTI, VGT, VCR. Once you hit retirement age or withdrawing for a house down payment or paying for medical expenses, the money you take out will not be taxed.

Imagine maxing out your roth contributions for 40 years and with compounding interest, you could potentially have a $1mil+ retirement nest egg that is NOT taxed when you take your money out.

Personally I do is, max out right away my roth ira contribution for the year. Once that is accomplished, I jack up my 401k contributions with enough money left for leisure and other life expenses.

My Roth is just VTI 80% and 20% split VGT/VCR. My individual stocks (AAPL, Visa, MSFT, AMD, DIS, GS, LOW, BABA etc) are on a separate personal brokerage account.

130,BABA," You have it all wrong.

First, an ADR is something like a US bank buys shares on a foreign market and issues ADRs.  If you own an ADR, your ADR price is pretty much exactly tied to the share price of on the foreign market.

BABA is not an ADR.  If you own BABA, you own shares in a company that's incorporated in the carribean.  It's not the same company as Alibaba in China.  The carribean company is setup by Alibaba management and it has some contracts with Alibaba in China.  Those contracts will be difficult to enforce, if there's some dispute.  This carribean company is called a VIE (variable interest entity).

You might be wondering why they do this instead of ADRs.  The reason is that it's illegal for foreigners to own shares in some Chinese companies, which ones are defined by sector.  All the internet companies are in a sector where it's illegal for foreigners to own shares.  The VIE is a way to get around those laws, but it has many risks that most people are ignoring.",ron_leflore,1,/r/investing/comments/oe56ht/what_is_the_difference_between_buying_a_hong_kong/h45e47e/,0.089,0.838,0.073,-0.718
