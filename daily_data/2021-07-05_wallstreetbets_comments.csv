155,DD," Good ideas in this DD, but probably a few years early. 

The single family home market is incredibly hot, probably overheated, but as long as major institutions (re: Blackstone) are rushing into this space buying entire neighborhood developments, I think there‚Äôs still room left to run. Why? Because people need a place to live and institutions are turning those neighborhoods into homes that are all single family rentals. This provides a way to meet housing demands of those who are fleeing big cities for the suburbs and a generation of student-debt-saddled graduates who do not have the ability to save enough money for a down payment on a home. Unfortunately, this will probably eliminate the most common way for the middle class to build wealth - home ownership.

The CMBS market was essentially closed for the last 18 months. It‚Äôs much more difficult to get the 80% LTV on retail properties than it was before COVID. The CMBS loans now require much more collateral - 60% to 65% is common. Most of the retail tenants that made it through the pandemic have experienced huge YoY sales growth.

He said the same thing about specs and fixed price. 3 years ago banks would practically laugh you out the door if you looked for a spec loan. They were too risky. Now, your construction loan HAS to be a spec loan, wtf? I've been in finance for real estate for the past 10 years in some capacity or another and I've never seen banks flip so fast in my life. 

The other issue is how localized residential real estate can be. Phoenix most likely won't see a crash, huge influx of people > lots of demand. Supply should catch up eventually, but I don't think they can build fast enough to saturate the market. However, this is a place everyone is moving to. What happens in communities that have a totally different dynamic? 

Finally, although housing is sensitive to interest rates, I doubt they will be able to go up enough to really shock the system. Rates might rise and you'll see an article saying home purchases plummeted, but I bet demand comes right back after people understand their mortgage only went up $50/mo.

If the crash is what the DD (not from OPs post, there is a lot more DD on RRPs and how the housing market with inflation is linked to a potential crash) shows, a ""job"" will barely keep you afloat. 

If you own a home, expect the value to drop. If you are invested in the stock market, expect a 30% decline. If you are hoarding cash, expect inflation to annihilate the value of it through the next few years. 

A stagnant wage will only do so much when your house price drops, leaving you stuck there, while goods and services all increase in price.

313,XPEV," XPEV is proceeding with dual listing in Hong Kong. Shares will list for the equivalent of $42.50 NYSE ADRs, and despite the lower listing price the shares are trending higher as it is.

If there's anyone with experience from dual listings, can you chip in the following thought?

IPOs usually see shares spike up in the first few days, even 100% over the listing price. Is there a possibility that the Hong Kong XPEV listing experiences something similar? and if it does, wouldn't the NYSE price have to follow suit?

I know that dual listings' share prices move in tandem, so I expect Hong Kong and NYSE prices to converge daily - otherwise there'll be arbitrage opportunities. However, I don't know if there's a potential surprise in the works on the 8th July when it's listing. The IPO take-up is 95% institutions and 5% retail, which is great as there's less likelihood of shares being dumped post-IPO compared to traditional IPOS where retail % is much higher.",ImFedUpWithItAll,-2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe47mk/daily_popular_tickers_thread_for_july_05_2021_gme/h44ve4p/,0.015,0.857,0.127,0.9479

403,IMO," Ya I think the experience is equivalent to a fart in your nose ... and it was just hyped up as like the thing to get if u aren't a poor and have *taste* almost like a status symbol .. and humans are habitual animals so they just keep going back and sht ... I think the status symbol aspect is wearing off though, and once ppl dont get brownie points for having starbucks anymore, they'll move onto whatever the new cool thing is. Snorting coffee beans or whatever. 

The whole brand is pretentious IMO. If I was looking for a coffee play I'd find a company shipping beans directly to customers, high quality fresh beans. That's where the value is at. And the experience of rich, fresh coffee, purchasing high quality fresh beans from some fancy ass place is more valuable, people are willing to pay more for that. And that value isn't going away. If anything, it only gets more valuable as good beans get harder to import. Or more expensive to grow domestically. Plus there's also a status symbol attached to that. Just a higher ticket one.

**Chip Shortage**

\- This one is the most obvious. In many cases it helps the bullish argument since $AMD (and [also $NVDA](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nvda/earnings) but fuckem) continues to exceed earnings estimates despite the rough environment. The [expansion of $TSMC into America](https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmc-says-construction-has-started-arizona-chip-factory-2021-06-01/), in my opinion, is going to launch $AMD into the fuckin' stratosphere over the next couple of years. 

Being the massive pussy that I am though, I'm concerned about how an impending crash will impact the supply and demand of semiconductor chips, [which computing technology consumes about 1/3 of](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/devices/how-and-when-the-chip-shortage-will-end-in-4-charts).

**$NVDA Stock Split**

Fuckin' $NVDA... always raining on the $AMD parade. I'm not angry just disappointed. This stock split is actually pretty insignificant. I expect the price of $NVDA post-split (1:4) to be somewhere between $150 and $250 just based on previous prices and my exceptional arithmetic skills. While this is still above $AMD stock price, I think it will be easier to compare the two tickers compared to $AMD $95 and $NVDA $800. 

**Innovation**

I'm an avid PC gamer. I literally have nothing going on other than my Steam account and my Fidelity account. This is (not) a cry for help.  IMO, $NVDA has the best net technology for GPUs. However $AMD offers more consumer-friendly products. I believe that $AMD cards offer the best value per dollar paid. (Unless you're one of those idiots paying 5 grand for a graphics card. I mean cmon, you can watch Pornhub Premium without an RTX 3080.) This catalyst is just going to be driven by overall consumer sentiment. If people begin realizing that their value is better spent on $AMD graphics cards, that [market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/754557/worldwide-gpu-shipments-market-share-by-vendor/) is gonna be gobbled the fuck up. Oh and processers? Yeah, $INTC is a piece of shit that I'm not concerned with. No source just facts. 

**Price Outlook**

If I was Michael Burry and had enough coke and psilocybin I would tell you guys the price target a year from now. But I'm a broke college student with no coke and barely enough psilo, so it's whatever. 

\- Short term I'm, playing AMD calls pretty close to the chest. Currently holding 7/9 $95c and 8/20 $100c. I roll up or down depending on how the week has gone. For a quick swing I try to enter in anywhere under $85.

\- Mid-term? I don't fucking know, get back to me if the market crashes. If not, 6-12months out, $100-$120 with a floor around $85-$90 just based on how we've been growing and the fact that resistance->support.

\- Long term, $NVDA levels. I believe with all my heart that $AMD is the better company and should be valued as such. They are a company that continues to exceed expectations and make great connections in the computing industry. For shares I would just buy and hodl until I retire. No selling on the dips.

R&D budgets are a big thing for tech, but still always a calculated risk. Making it limited and focused on highly profitable pursuits.
In a govt lab such as ORNL, the primary driver is not profitability but cutting edge work that is prohibitively expensive for private sector.

What does all this mean? It means that when a private company is contracted to work on a big computing research project, they are effectively paid to do R&D, as well as generate cutting edge technologies giving them a significant edge over their competitors.
Just think of this as someone winning a scholarship to study engineering at MIT. Earnings potential before the degree vs after kinda speaks for itself.


* Observe $NVDA price action over the last 15yrs.
* Note when the Summit supercomputer contract was awarded.
* Note when the project was completed.
* Accdist indicator, volume, and general price action should show early bird entry (folks who knew precisely how this was going to play out), and when wallstreet figured out wtf was going on.


Now compare with $AMD.
* Look at the price action over the last 6 years or so.
* Note when the Frontier supercomputer contract was awarded.
* Note when the project was/will be completed/delivered.
* If you have access to option data, you will see significant volume even when it was sub $30 (this is smart money).


Afterwards, pull up the financial overview of both NVDA and AMD.
Compare their market cap, YOY & QOQ revenue growth.

508,IT," Current companies work via signatures, or by parsing logs and what's already known based on their detection database.

Ironnet sensor sits on the network interface reading network data to analyze the current traffic and act upon it immediately, instead of waiting for antivirus companies to push out new dats, and then the end user IT bro at the company to update them. Antivirus companies can only work on the known malware, Ironnet gives the ability to be proactive with unknown threats

The methodology is more proactive because it doesn't require some jamoke to keep things up to date, it analyzes the traffic itself and understands how malware actually works.

It then shares those detections with everyone in the dome. Can be similar to how NATO works with physical threats.

The main issue is that there are much cheaper options to produce circuit boards at scale.

Their product is good for R&D, Prototyping etc. The reason they sell to defense industries is because many clients in this field need the discretion in development and they can do it in house.

Also there is an issue with materials, the materials they print with are not alike industrial grade materials, so a board you prototyped using their printer, must then go under an additional phase when moved to scale production, due to inductivity issues and such

555,CASH," We don't need luck; we need patience. Here's why.

Last fall, NNDM continually held stock offerings to raise money. Yoav Stern, who heads the company, knew that although the product (Dragonfly 3D printer) they offer is revolutionary, the actual function of the machine was not up to snuff for mass production, which is what they seek to make the company successful. It‚Äôs a lot of technical jargon, but it pretty much comes down to this: the Dragonfly can print circuit boards that actually do work, but they are prone to failure due to the nozzles that spit the material not being refined enough to do real detailed work.

Think of it as operating on someone with a hatchet instead of a scalpel. Yes, you can sharpen a hatchet enough that it makes a clean cut, but DAMN would it be nice to have something a little smaller and more precise to do better work. The other problem is that it‚Äôs really fixing hard to dictate all the steps a machine like that needs to go through to consistently perform such complex tasks. If only the machine could ‚Äúlearn‚Äù as it makes mistakes, maybe it could teach itself to do a better job as time goes on (more on this later).

So anyways, now Yoav and his buddies have a metric shit ton of cash after all the offerings. He goes shopping for the two things he needs to make this tech actually feasible: machine learning/A.I., and smaller, more accurate components to scale for precision. This is where his most recent acquisitions come in. DeepCube, Micro Mechanical, and Nano Fabrica.

These companies are exactly what he needs to bring his newest product (Dragonfly 2.0) to market with the ability to print consistent, repeatable, quality circuit boards on a grand/mass production scale. And thanks to the stock offerings, they have $1.4B left after the acquisitions to actually do it. We're being told that we could see the new machine as soon as this fall. 

TL;DR The company has very much not collapsed. It has completely changed it's approach to it's core business model. The revenue doesn't matter, because they have pivoted away from the 1st machine that they were counting on generating that revenue.

After all their pull out is explicitly to face beijing‚Äôs expansionist/revisionist endeavors. 

All in all were seeing a lotta money, a lotta infra and a lotta things going for the commodities game. I remember us eyeing up the effects of the iran deal on the comms market, and how loose theyve been with trade restrictions even before the formal embargo lift. Long run i think we see decent equilibrium but im going long theta on commodities either way. Feels safer than trying to game spy rn.

606,WISH," I know (edit: sorry, not fair to say I know, but I had assumed this was the case), and u/GasolinePizza responded to that comment as a mod to tell him he's wrong.  I guess what I'm getting at is, this is a losing battle.  Reasoning with them isn't working.  Waiting for them to assimilate isn't working.  And this isn't just people who visit from all, because you still can't get good posts past the pump and dump spam on the front page.

They've had enough time.  Why not a public crackdown?  Create a zero tolerance period and put it front and center.  No Bullshitting is still a rule on this sub, we don't even need to create a No Cults rule.  No scams & schemes, no market manipulation.  Ban every account that creates a post in violation of those rules.  Remove the incentive to spam WSB with bullshit.  Because right now, it's in their interest to do so.

There was a guy in the daily yesterday who wanted to know, in earnest, what he needed to do to become an approved user.  He's a WISH spammer.

650,INSE," I‚Äôm buying more Boeing. I bought a ton under $100 in March/April 2020, those long term gains are locked in. I‚Äôve picked away at it over the last year. I don‚Äôt see a ton of value out there generally speaking and, even though I‚Äôm a member of this forum, I admit I like traditional companies (with sales and INVENTORY, ideally a dominant market position). Boeing has one competitor in the world and they‚Äôre based in Europe (big disadvantage imo). Uncle Sam and Boeing are partners for life, presidents literally intercede on their behalf. Definition of too big to fail. And, frankly, I just like their products. I feel the 737 Max is the future of aviation, though it‚Äôs had growing pains. I plan to hold indefinitely/never pay tax on it. 

Boring? Yes. Safe? Probably. But lately I‚Äôve been thinking a lot more about securing my principle after the outsized gains of the past year.

Lets be uber generous and give QS a P/S of 100, and say you're fine with a rate of return of 5% a year lmao, then


(39m/1.05^5 )*100  = $3.05bn 

then divided by 368m shares = $8.28 per share. 

You better hope QS grows 1000% YoY from 2025 onwards, best of luck",wowAmaze,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oecycr/qs_this_is_why_im_still_in/h45sies/,0.0,0.628,0.372,0.9769

745,QS," How do you figure that they are on track to become the biggest manufacturer in the US? I thought their factory expansion that's supposed to finish in 2025 will bring them to 11 GWh of annual production, well under Tesla's current production. Tesla's prototype production of 4680 cells is probably going to be at a 20GWh annualized production rate by the end of this year. Not saying that Microvast doesn't have potential, but both MVST and QS are still massive amounts of CapEx away from being major players.",SpaceBound6991,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oecycr/qs_this_is_why_im_still_in/h464w8e/,0.0,0.982,0.018,0.1406
