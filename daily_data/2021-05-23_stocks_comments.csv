Comparatively, Apple has a debt to equity ratio of 1.76, MSFT is 1.3, Netflix's is well above 2. Amazon is the closest but still at 0.3.

7,TV," I know high inflation is a nice easy thing to point out and suddenly every talking head on TV uses it to sound smart…

We are experiencing instantaneous inflation because of a downsized supply to demand, not due to hyper consumption demand.

Businesses have spent the last 14 months downsizing overhead and variable expenses to survive the cratered demand from the pandemic, and can now not come close to meeting the nationally synchronized increase in demand as vaccination allow us more freedom.

For Example: my colleague was freaking out about hyper inflation last week, b/c her rental car for summer vacation cost her $95/day for a sedan. Rental Car companies decimated their fleets when they realized there would be little to no demand for months if not year(s). Now as travel even picks up a bit (most people are still not getting in a plane for a family vacation), even the small spike in demand is creating a supple gap which will fix itself over the next six months…stop freaking out.",strukout,1,/r/stocks/comments/niyift/15_companies_with_the_most_cash_reserves_traded/gz5l51y/,0.091,0.817,0.092,0.6214

23,CP," It is invested. But typically manufacturing companies tend to hold their cash in relatively liquid funds and take virtually no risk with their investments. The result is that you see a lot of overnight investments with banks, money market funds, etc. With $50 B, they're probably pushing out tenors and getting some more uplift there, but I would be shocked if they're investing in anything too long term, or anything below investment grade CP of other companies or the like. The result is that their investment portfolio is earning something like <0.50% annually. Overnights are below 10 bps right now, money markets are below 5 bps, and low investment grade CP is like 20-30 bps for month long paper. It's a terrible time for yields.

62,ATH," Firstly, there are fees associated with the leverage these etfs provide.

Secondly, volatility is killing them. Let's look at an example. 
Let's say the underlying is in a very volatile phase. It is going from $100 to $90 in a day. That's a 10% drop. The ETF will tripple it and fall 30% to $70.

The very next day the underlying will completely recover and go back to $100. That's a 11.1% gain. The ETF will tripple that again and gain 33.3%. But 1.333*$70 is not $100, but $93.33

While the underlying is exactly where it started, the ETF is still 6.6% in the hole.

63,DD," Fees are much higher.

Loss of 1% requires a gain of 1.01% to get back to your starting balance.

Loss of 3% requires a gain of 3.09% to get back to your starting balance.

Stack losses like this one on top of the other and hopefully you can see why that can be bad.

Liquidity of some leveraged ETFs can be a problem when trading. But not *super* serious when holding long term. i.e. no Paper hands. If your plan is to hold long term. Hold.

The volatility decay many are siting magnifies losses in a bear market, but it also magnifies gains in a bull market (beyond the leveraged amount).

Checkout [Hedgefundie's Excellent Adventure](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/hedgefundie-adventure/) for a more in-depth look.

Given Bill Foleys track record at Fidelity National and D&B of downsizing costs and multiplying profit margins it seems very tempting to buy more shares/warrants but I’d love some more input regarding the potential downsides to PSFE (besides it’s lackluster performance the last 15/20 years).

118,KMB," You have to wait at least 30 days to buy it again if you want to use the losses in your taxes. Otherwise, you sold it for a loss and will not gain any benefit from it tax wise. 

People, understand short term gains and long term gains. Even if you reinvest the money in stocks, unlike real estate, you will pay taxes on them. Short term taxes will be higher than long term taxes (owning the stock for at least 1 year before selling it). Be very aware of this, cause it is all fun and games now, but come tax season, you could be looking at owing the federal government money that you may not have at hand.

EDIT: Let me add: first in-first out. So, if you purchased a stock and you sold it for a loss. Let's say you purchased 10 shares of KMB at 200 and it's now trading at 100. You held KMB for over a year, and they've have paid you dividends, and you reinvested the dividends in to the company. When you sell your shares of KMB, the ones your originally purchased will be counted against your long term gain taxes. The partial share purchased through dividends will be counted against your short term gain taxes. There's a $500 limit that you can claim on losses. If you have $700 in losses, you can use the $500 total this year and roll the $200 to next year's taxes.

154,GME, I want to agree with you but then you had to bring up naked shorting.  What happened with GME wasn't even naked shorting.  There has been zero evidence of naked shorting.  If you borrow shares to short a stock it is not naked shorting.  Failure to deliver does not necessarily mean naked shorting occurred. It can also occur if you sell your shares that your broker has loaned out and they cannot get the shares back in time for settlement.  Eventually the person they loaned them to has to close their position if they cannot locate other shares to return.  I bring up failure to deliver because that is what all the conspiracy minded people bring up as proof of naked shorting and GME had a high rate of failure to deliver (mainly because the volume was such a high % of the float at the same time the short interest was so high).  I am not saying that naked shorting doesn't happen but it does not happen as frequently as people on reddit think it does.

This is why SpaceX is using LIDAR when the Dragon spacecraft approaches the ISS & docks, 100% autonomously.

Tesla uses LIDAR to calibrate their camera based pseudo-stereoscopic distance measurements with LIDAR measurements.

The various disadvantages of LIDAR  are not a problem in such calibration runs:

- **High LIDAR unit cost:** not a problem, because there are only a few calibration units.
- **Poor LIDAR performance in rain & snow:** not a problem, as the calibration runs are done in good weather.
- **Interference of many LIDAR units:** since they'll never scale this up, there's no interference in practice.
- **Health risks of LIDAR:** they don't need high power LIDAR, nor are there multiple vehicles for the LIDAR laser beams to add up & cause eye or equipment damage.
- **High mapping & map maintenance costs of 3D HD LIDAR maps**: not a problem, because Tesla is not using HD 3D maps at all - they compare LIDAR return to the neural network stack distance estimates to calibrate.
- **Poor ability of LIDAR to distinguish between surfaces, detect curbs, etc.**: not a problem either, because if Tesla's camera FSD system is calibrated for large objects that LIDAR sees well, it works for small objects and surface features as well.
- **Necessity of LIDAR units to be mounted high at the top of the vehicle to maximize angular resolution & object detection - hurting aerodynamic profile & efficiency:** not a problem, as the energy efficiency of R&D cars is immaterial.

Tesla basically uses these high-end LIDAR units - probably the highest quality ones money can buy - to establish an independent ""ground truth"" to validate their own camera + neural network ASIC based 3D object recognition & tracking technologies.

162,FSD," Not exactly, rather than true autonomy, the competitors are basically building out park rides that have to ""follow"" specific ""tracks"" (mapped out roads and drivable areas) that locks them into a single area. Since they only follow the tracks it's an easier problem to solve computationally. 

Eventually, the competitors will be able to map out everything, but there's a finite limit to how quickly they can do so, and there are a lot more roads that can be mapped out. The competitors will do well as long as the driver's stay within the park, but it'll be quite dangerous to go outside of it.

Tesla seeks to be able to drive pretty much anywhere. This is a much harder problem computationally and will take longer to solve. So it certainly does come down to which solves which first.

I live in a fairly rural area, I would be very surprised if any Tesla competitor becomes located in my area within the decade, as they will be focusing on cities, so they will likely become available in every city, then start mapping smaller and smaller towns before they have full coverage. Perhaps they can do something like Tesla and put mapping systems into the cars that are already driving and thus speed up the process. But in the end, the scaling problem isn't something that can be quickly resolved, though the issues on Tesla's side are certainly not trivial either, though they don't have any scaling issue. They are already operating at scale, they just need to get the software (and perhaps hardware) working as well as they would like. That is just a matter of continuous improvement.

Overall, I believe I'll see a Tesla robotaxi in use in my area before I see a non-Tesla robotaxi, though I'm certainly hard pressed to say whether it'll be a few months from now or a few years from now, though I think it is likely to be 2-5 years, mostly for regulatory reasons. Even when it is considered truly FSD, it will require probably at least a few months of data to act as evidence that it truly is better than a human before it get's regulatory approval.

163,TSLA," How are they “way ahead”? Who is they? And define “way ahead”? Genuinely curious. I am a shareholder of TSLA but afaik, TSLA has the most real world data for autonomous driving, almost millions of more miles more than the next competitor which is Waymo. And Waymo lost a few key executives in the past few months.",DisastrousBluebirb,1,/r/stocks/comments/nj3owh/has_elon_changed_his_mind_about_lidar/gz5eef8/,0.061,0.91,0.029,-0.4291
