0,EDIT," I briefly looked at their financials and would really have to dig into it to understand whats going on however there is a large difference between GAAP and nonGAPP earnings.

You would really have to dig through the filings to see the difference , I believe they have to report a reconciliation between the two that should spell it out.

However in some cases a company can have negative GAAP earnings but be cash flow positive due to some non-cash expenses.

Example lets say a company sold stock (or bonds) and raised a bunch of capital. It then invested the raised money in capital assets (buildings, equipment, software ect) .

In a few years now they have large deprecation expenses , now these are non-cash expenses when you deprecate a building for 1 million per year, you actually already paid for the building you are just writing it off as deprecation, you don't have to pay anyone that 1 million dollars.

So they can basically be cash flow positive but have to report a loss due to large non-cash expenses like deprecation. They may not be able to pay off debt as the debt may not be callable.

6,CC," OK, think we need to learn you the difference between National Debt and traditional debt like you're probably thinking of. See below:

#Primer: Sovereign Debt vs CC Debt - Not the Same Thing

>It's not that kind of debt.

>If it were up to me, economists would invent an entirely new word for what we currently call ""sovereign debt."" Because what you think of as ""debt"" when you consider your personal finances — your upside-down mortgage, your monthly car payment, that credit card balance you've been chipping away at — operates under completely different principles and rules than those that govern sovereign debt.

>Sovereign debt is, put simply, how money is created.

>Have you ever wondered exactly why a dollar — not a dollar bill, but the intangible dollar itself — has value? A naive answer is that it has value simply because we all agree that it does, and while there are elements of that to it, that's not really the right answer.

>A dollar that exists today has value because it's backed by debt. No other reason.

>Imagine you wanted to start your own economy from scratch. I don't know, in Candyland or something, in a fantasy world completely isolated from the real one. How would you go about doing it?

>Well, first you'd need a government of some kind. That's obvious. You need to have a state — with universally recognized authority and power — for a lot of other, non-economic reasons anyway, so that's okay. The first thing you do is somehow establish your state.

>Since you've got a government, can you just decree some money into existence? Well, you could try, but because you've studied your economics, you know that won't actually work. A monetary unit you just invent out of nothing has no value; it's not backed by anything. So it doesn't work out in practice.

>Instead, you establish for yourself two institutions, one a part of the government and one entirely separate from it. The first institution is the treasury, which is a part of the government that has the legal authority (backed by the legitimacy of your government) to buy and sell things, and to issue securities called bonds.

>The other institution you create is a central bank. The central bank is established by (or with the sanction of, anyway) the government, and has a special power: It can create and destroy money. Literally out of nothing. The central bank is the one institution in your economy that can say ""Abracadabra, money now exists.""

>So now you have an institution that can buy and sell (the treasury) and an institution that can create money (the central bank) … but there's no actual money. None has been created. So you aren't done.

>The next step in the shake-and-bake-economy recipe is to have your treasury issue a series of bonds. A bond is a financial instrument that works under certain rules. The rules that matter here are that a bond is created on a certain date with a certain face value, sold for less than that face value, then redeemed on a specific future date at that face value. So we'll imagine you order your treasury to issue a bond today with a face value of $100, to offer it for sale for $90, and to give it a maturity date of one year from today.

>Of course … nobody can buy that bond, because nobody has $90, because nobody has any dollars; no dollars have been created yet. Which means that bond you're trying to sell just sits there … until the old white guy in the suit you appointed to run your central bank wakes up from his nap and realizes the he can buy it. He has the power to create money out of nothing. So he does. He fiats — as the term goes — $90 into existence, and gives it to you, taking your bond in return.

>Now your treasury has $90 in it, which means you can hire some of your impoverished citizens to start building a road or something.

>Impoverished Citizen #3 takes his first week's pay and deposits it into a bank, which now has a lending reserve, and lends it out thus creating more money, and et cetera et cetera, you can look up the details on how fractional reserve lending works if you want, 'cause it's off the topic right now.

>Thus have you started up your new economy. The central bank created a small amount of money (relatively) and bought your sovereign bonds with it, that money went into circulation, it spiraled around and around the fractional-reserve banking system creating more money, capital is now freely available, industry is booming, wealth is being created at a healthy rate, and everything's just fine.

>Except — gasp! — your government is in debt! Those bonds you sold to the central bank are coming due soon! You're going to have to buy them back — repaying the debt you took on when you started up the economy! And you have no money to do that with! Whatever do you do!?

>You issue a new round of bonds. You sell them just like you sold the last round: to anybody with money. Except last time the only entity in the whole economy that had any money was the central bank, while this time everybody has money. Some of the people with money want a way to store it for the long term, so they're more than happy to exchange their money for a bond, then sell that bond later to turn it back into spendable cash. So all you have to do is issue a new round of bonds, cash flows into the treasury, and when the central bank comes calling to have its bonds redeemed, you use your new cash to buy them back.

>Except now the central bank has money … which it does not need or want. The central bank has no need of money, and money sitting on account at the central bank isn't doing anything useful. So the central bank turns right back around and knocks on your door and says ""Hey, got any bonds you want to sell?""

>Which returns us to the normal condition again: The central bank holds bonds which back money, and the actual money those bonds back circulates throughout the economy, doing useful work.

>Does the government still technically carry debt on its books? Yes … technically. But that isn't like household debt; it's not like having a balance on your credit card. The government doesn't have to, and in fact shouldn't, work to wipe that debt out. Instead, that debt — again, only in the most technical sense of the word — backs all the money in the economy. Every dollar that exists in your whole economy can trace its ""family tree,"" if you will, back to a bond your government issued. That's where the money comes from. If the bonds disappeared, so would the money, because there'd be nothing backing it.

>So when people talk about the US public debt, do not, do not, do not think of that as a looming threat of bankruptcy. It isn't. Sovereign debt doesn't work like personal debt. When you get in debt, you want to get out of it as fast as you can … which is both sensible and wise. But debts held by governments are the very foundation of the economy.

>So the straight answer to your question — why is the US in so much debt — is this: Because the US economy is so huge. There are so many dollars in the world — nearly ten and a half trillion of 'em as of last week — the US dollar economy needs a great big foundation.

7,USA," I don't think there are any studies like that. To begin with assumptions about national debt acceleration always having the same results is a bit far fetched. Simply from an economical perspective you can theorize about debt like that. However national debt is intrinsically linked to politics. 

This question ""how does national debt affect the economy of states?"" is too broad. To answer it we would first need to specify: What state? 

.. Or at least what category of states. 
What accelerating national debt means for the economy is tied to local national contexts. African 3rd world countries, Western Europe, Latin America, USA, China, Greece, Haiti, Japan and so on. Accelerated national debt would have vastly different effects for each of these countries and regions.

8,USA," No, because the interest payments are backed by the tax revenue of the United States tax payers. Seems like trusting the good people of the USA to pay their income taxes is a fairly riskless asset base for the US Treasury to auction off the cash flows to.

9,GDP," True, its not a 1:1 comparison, but counterpoint is that the US economy will, almost certainly continue to grow.

10,IT," Dude, it's the 21th century not the 19th. Foreign states have already done several successful attacks against the heart of America, infrastructure, via IT. Russian hacking groups (totally not tied to Putin) managed to stop the water supply in large areas for days and the American government, army, and *every single agency was unable to do shit about it*.




A simple D-DOS attack can cripple US harder then any fleet of aircraft carriers ever could. A true foreign attack will target critical infrastructure and will be IT-based, not by grunts walking the streets. It'll be Q-anon bullshit, conspiracies and turning the people against their own president and leaders/constitution (see January 2021).



As for military superiority the *best* of the US Navy were unable to detect a Swedish submarine harbouring New York waters for a good *2 weeks*.

COIN is also a combination of exchange/broker/bank, which is subject to the whims of government regulations.  As we keep seeing Binance get banned everywhere, Coinbase with its board of Andreseen Horowitz and ex government crypto regulators, might be the best positioned for compliance.  And that makes institutional investors trust & flock to Coinbase, giving them a unique early mover advantage.

You keep mentioning Youtube in other comments and saying that Vimeo should be worth more, but I think you're missing a key point: YouTube is not a standalone service. YT is worth more to google than it is to outside investors because there are significant shared core competencies in the ad market. It's way easier for Google to monetize and make YT profitable than it is for Vimeo management to do the same with them.

Maybe video streaming services are not viable standalone companies. Maybe there's a reason the market leader is a wholly owned subsidiary of an advertising giant. Maybe there's a reason that Vimeo's smaller business-focused competitors aren't public companies.

One last thing: you never really propose WHY you think Vimeo is undervalued or how they can achieve profitability. If I were you I'd work through a timeline and see what that looks like.

26,IRS," There is a ton on information on the web about people purchasing LEGO sets for investment purposes. I just wanted to chime in with one often overlooked aspect of trying to beat traditional investments by doing this. 

You have to consider the cost of selling the sets and taxes. If you list them on eBay, take 20% off the selling price for listing fees, packing materials and payment processing. You have few seller protections on eBay if the buyer receives a damaged set or decides to scam you. Also, included in the CARES Act was a provision requiring all payment processors like PayPal, Square, etc to report sales of over $600 in a calendar year to the IRS starting in 2022, so you will have to pay taxes on any gains you make from the sale of the sets. No hiding from the tax man.

If you try to sell the sets on Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist for cash, the likelihood of receiving the same price as an online marketplace is slim. You are limited to your local market and in person, cash buyers are almost always looking for a discount over online prices. Selling on consignment through a dealer or auction is even more expensive than eBay, so the odds of making a profit are decreased by a substantial margin. 

The cost of storage is also often overlooked. You need a climate controlled area to store the sets in because collectors are obsessed with the condition of the original packaging. Sticking them in a basement or attic for 10+ years is not a good idea because of this issue and renting a climate controlled storage unit for years at a time is expensive.",respectfulskeptic,3,/r/investing/comments/p1hh9q/anyone_tried_investing_with_lego/h8f3j1g/,0.071,0.875,0.054,-0.2437

37,IS," > What is everyone doing to protect their portfolios from a possible downturn or crash? 

This question has been asked since the last significant drawdown (March 2020) and then since the one before that (Deccember 2018) and the one before that. If it's ""economically sunny"" for long enough this sub starts obsessing over whether the slightest cloud could be rain. It's been that way for more than half a decade. The opposite end is also true - when it is actually raining (December 2018, March 2020) often right before the sun comes back out part of this sub is *certain* that the storm is going to get much worse.

I invest what I'm comfortable with in companies I'm most long-term confident in. I lost a lot between the peak in Feb 2020 and the bottom in March 2020 and then went on to have an absolutely, very unexpectedly fantastic year. I got way more aggressive in March 2020 as the VIX got to levels higher than the worst of 2008 rather than selling or going more conservative. 

Purchases at low levels in 2018 and 2020 resulted in having a much lower cost basis on a number of things, quite a bit of which was sold last year and early this year because they had so far exceeded what I'd expected in a very brief period of time (but even though those things were sold because they far exceeded expectations, I just used the proceeds to buy a number of stocks, just different ones.)

 I own Sea (SE), which got to $288 earlier this year before it corrected back to the high $100's. If I bought Sea at $288 and it corrected, big bummer. If I bought SE on average much lower, bummer but far easier psychologically to deal with. The stock recently made new all time highs and making another one pre-market.

People have this view of ""market crash around every corner"" and I think the concern with that is that people are going to sell winners at the slightest hint of volatility because even the slightest hint of volatility is going to lead to people going, ""OMG IS THIS ANOTHER 2008!?!?!"" and then they sell their winners and when the market rebounds, they get frustrated. You don't have to react to every little bit of news. Let signs of a more concerning market environment come to you and build up a bit rather than constantly be straining to come up with reasons and selling at the first sign of any sort of volatility. What is a ""action-worthy"" drawdown? You shouldn't feel as if you need to avoid every 5-10% correction.

""commodities?""

No. If you think there's a downturn coming, you're also thinking that there's going to be less commodity usage. Additionally, a lot of commodity futures products are structured as master limited partnerships, which you don't want especially if it's for a trade.

""Are bonds a good bet with interest rates set to climb?""

Opposite.

People could find good alternative strategy funds but 1) there really aren't that many good alternative strategy funds available to retail investors and 2) the obsession with retail investors regarding fees would result in many retail investors wanting nothing to do with alternative strategies given that the nature of alternative strategies (long/short, etc) often results in higher fees. 

Additionally, if you are a young person there is sort of the question of  if you're frequently trying to hedge and having attempts at conservatism because of the perception of a market crash around every corner, are you investing with a long investing time horizon, do you have more money invested than comfortable with or some other issue (risk tolerance?)

There's going to be other 20-30% drawdowns in the future; I have no idea when the next one is but I choose not to invest as if they are potentially around every corner. The more people go through those kinds of periods, I think more people get somewhat used to them especially if they see success buying dips in the period after these sorts of declines. I don't think that they are ""around every corner"" and personally, I'd rather focus on finding new ideas. If the majority of your time related to investing is trying to determine when the next market crash might be I'd highly recommend trying to change - negative stories in financial media are going to easily sway you, you're going to sell winners at the slightest correction and events are going to be a potential ""sell everything"" (tons of ""i'm selling everything!"" posts before the election last year - the election happened, the market took off and then the vaccine news was not long after that.)",dvdmovie1,13,/r/investing/comments/p1lgu7/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h8e98bk/,0.07,0.85,0.08,0.9366

48,CLOV," Selling a loss or holding on.

Basically self-explanatory. Generally speaking, I'd say that I am an investor who takes a good look at his potential investing targets and has an idea about what could go wrong, what could go right and what's danger zone.

However, that's not true for all the stocks I've bought.

Some have been speculative plays, and I'm not proud of that. Some I've made decent money on (EUCAR; although I did look into them before I'd still say it was a big gamble I took)

Now I have one stock that's most certainly utter sh\*te, and that stock is CLOV.

Yes, you got me - I'm embarrassed to say it, but I did take a gamble when Memestocks were about, and of course it backfired. 

I put around $500 into CLOV and I am down about 51%. This means that my position is quite small, but it's not absolutely tiny.

And now I'm thinking - do I actually take the huge hit or should I stay in and hope?

I have since looked and CLOV, and truth be told, I don't really believe in it. I don't believe that CLOV's fair price on a fundamental basis will be above what I bought it ($18) within the next 2-3 years. (That said, I do have trouble valueing companies that are losing money, I find it much easier with profitable companies)

But, and that's where the gambling comes in: I also don't see CLOV going bancrupt anytime soon and, well, it's a memestock. It's not the biggest of memestocks, but somehow there may be the off-chance of it having a rennaissance and getting hyped and overvalued massively again.

That said, should I really wait for that to happen and bank on it when I don't have any conviction in the stock?",RoronoaZorro,1,/r/investing/comments/p1lgbp/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h8evbsg/,0.059,0.838,0.103,0.9269

Compare that one year price target with where XOM is currently sitting.  if you see good appreciation available, stock is still a buy (for me that's 25% or more).  if stock is close or above your target, don't ask questions, just sell.  in between, up to you.  Given this sounds like a short term gain right now, there is a tax benefit if it is in the ""hold"" zone to hang on to it and sell it after it goes long term.  However, if you have better places to put the money, take your gains and move on to the next thing.",LiqCourage,2,/r/investing/comments/p1lgbp/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h8f2dbw/,0.0,0.854,0.146,0.9747

Right now vanguard has a patent that sort of marries ETF shares and MF shares to the same fund but different share classes

Some of the things I have found my cpa has surprised me with in past years are things like vehicle tax credits, Puerto Rican tax credits (and we got to support Puerto Rico after they got nailed by a hurricane which was awesome), etc. 

I highly recommend at least exploring the option. I love that I’m being downvoted for advising professional advice from tax professionals.
