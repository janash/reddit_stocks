2,CW," ARKX is a fund pretty much made to amass positions and wait at the sideline until SPACEX goes public (and follow-up with more space operation companies that get up to speed with the space era). So it's a LONG-term play. The ""disappointing reveal"" was allocation of whoever afforded/wanted to get onboard this train from day one. A train that isn't getting anywhere really far until more than  like 5-10 (?) years out.

(Unless you thought that once ARKX launched, technology would instantaneously progress to the point of being able to colonize Mars and mine in the asteroid belt...)

So, for some investors it just makes sense to allocate TODAY instead of trying to time when technology will actually enable at-scale operations in space.

Also,

""churning out ETFs to reap management fees"" is the same level of FUD that was going around the last 4 months during the big pullback (which CW specifically warned investors about BEFORE it happened) where haters were prancing around subreddits claiming that ARKs are about to shutdown and that CW is a snakeoil saleswoman trying to keep her management fees.

If you have constructive criticism regarding either ARKs or BTC/crypto it's cool, let's hear it. As it is though, this post reads more like an indirect passive/aggressive accusation of CW being a scammer and looks like it's trying to get the hater bandwagon back together...",papachric,20,/r/stocks/comments/o9vkdf/cathie_woods_ark_invest_files_to_create_a_bitcoin/h3doxxi/,0.077,0.839,0.084,0.194

You can also argue that being useful or not might be irrelevant to Bitcoin's worth as long as enough people agree on the given value. Certainly the past few years seem to support this, as unnerving as it might be for a good number of investors.

I don't know of anything higher % than barron's though I havent dug around.

By the time legacy brokerages are trading a few cryptos Coinbase could be wrapping defi protocols seamlessly into their UI, half of which their venture arm vetted and seeded, with the best insurance offerings because of their understanding and history, and probably doing the back end custody and liquidity for those banks, etc. Their institutional support people will be way more knowledgeable, and have access to 100x deeper liquidity.

They will grow, don't get me wrong, but what really surprised me learning about space companies is the small satellite launchers that are already successful, and the number that have great projects in the pipeline that no one has heard of, with awesome ideas for re usability, practicality, and efficient manufacturing. For a long hold ETF, it's not a terrible move.

SPCE uses a plane launch platform currently, which is very limited on payload capacity and orbit trajectories. Yes this can be developed further, and they can eventually move to ground launches, but they don't have this tech and are not actively testing that tech while other companies are. They make the news because people like hearing about millionaires going into space, but small companies are making moves to have a mobile small sat launchers, and fully 3D printed engines which can be built in a day (early development here, but promising).

For me, any investment decision has to be backed by an understanding of the layers of human logic behind it. Why do I believe humans are going to make this investment grow?

For anything, even cryp, if I haven't justified the several layers of human behavior that are tied to my predicted market movement, than I'd be betting on fiction.

To me, DD based on P/E and such is a baseline starting point, far from the final analysis. Positive ratios like P/E act as a filter to point the way at what to look at.

In reality, every position I have that is up a large amount was purchased during a downturn or dip on the individual stock, most in late 2018 - early 2019 and then March - Oct last year.

Why on Earth do people think they can mathematically prove that it's better to buy now and watch it flounder and most likely go down rather than waiting for down weeks?  Doesn't make sense even when you do the math.  For example, I patiently waiting to buy more JPM and lo and behold I only needed to wait a month and then it dipped 10% to $148. And this keeps happening every few months on most stocks (though usually the drop is 5-7%.   People will shoot out vague platitudes like ""compounding"" without thinking that not much is compounding when the DJIA hovered in the same territory for 3 months, like we've been seeing!

I’ve learned this with FAANG + MSFT + Nvidia the last few years specifically. It’s better to invest in competent companies in phenomenal industries. Because as long as the macro conditions are fine, their PEs will run parallel to their 20%+ annual earnings rates.

Obviously Thiel is right when you look at situations such as 2000. Which is why it’s important to have good leadership. I doubt Cisco Intel and Microsoft stagnate like they did if it weren’t for shitty CEOs post-2000.

Some dividend stocks can get away with this, like REITs, but companies like IBM and T are wrecked by their rich dividend payouts.

This is what I like about it:
Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing. “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.”

Partnered with Coinbase, Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, and Pointsbet among many others.

Voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method”

Paysafe has the #2 digital wallet globally with a presence in 120 countries. They own Skrill, which is enabled for crypto-to-crypto trading (Bitcoin & 26 other crypto-currencies) and was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.”

In Europe, where Paysafe is more known, Trustpilot rates Paysafe as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars) with over 29,000 reviews, and Skrill as “great” (4.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews. They are currently laying the groundwork for their US expansion.

Unlike any other payment processor, Paysafecard enables those without bank accounts or credit cards (the over 1.7 billion “unbanked”) to engage in online commerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.

Paysafe’s industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are slow to enter. CEO Philip McHugh: “When we talk about a deep and a wide moat, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.”

In Q1 Paysafe had $90 million in one-time expenses associated with merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. This means without those expenses they would have beat analysts estimates and, going forward, they are well positioned to beat analysts EPS estimates for the rest of the year.

Recent debt management, saving around $92 million annually, secures higher margins and higher profits which will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.

Paysafe confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 growth projection which doesn’t include planned inorganic M&A growth pipeline and iGaming expansion (55% CAGR).

From 2017 to 2019, under Blackstone/CVC stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion. (28% CAGR) 2020 saw revenue stagnate due to Covid-related business closures and high-risk channel exits but, even so, if you add 2020’s performance, 2017-2020 still amounts to a respectable 18% CAGR, roughly the same as PayPal’s current projected growth.

Buy rating from all seven analysts covering Paysafe, with 50-70% upside from current price but, with everything noted above, it’s clear that Paysafe would still be significantly undervalued when compared to a basket of comps (PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign) with a collective growth rate of ~12.5% (in Paysafe’s 10-13% range):

Paysafe's price based on sector peer multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75

EV/Rev ratio : $44.64

EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Valuation Notes:

Removed all high outliers in each category putting PSFE at $100+
Unlike Paysafe's reported $362 million in free cash flow (on track to increase 29%) and 30%+ EBITDA margin, half of peers report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.
Paysafe has better EPS than over half of the peer group
Paysafe has better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them

Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, Bill Foley, has a proven track record in generating value for his investors through rapid synergistic inorganic growth. This is a key strategic pillar for Paysafe. Over the last five years Foley has grown Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).

116,GPN," Yeah, just added to Russell 3000 and 1000. Found bottom support and getting ready to build upward momentum imo.

This is what I like about it:
Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing. “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.”

Partnered with Coinbase, Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, and Pointsbet among many others.

Voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method”

Paysafe has the #2 digital wallet globally with a presence in 120 countries. They own Skrill, which is enabled for crypto-to-crypto trading (Bitcoin & 26 other crypto-currencies) and was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.”

In Europe, where Paysafe is more known, Trustpilot rates Paysafe as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars) with over 29,000 reviews, and Skrill as “great” (4.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews. They are currently laying the groundwork for their US expansion.

Unlike any other payment processor, Paysafecard enables those without bank accounts or credit cards (the over 1.7 billion “unbanked”) to engage in online commerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.

Paysafe’s industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are slow to enter.

145,IMO," I’ve actually heavily loaded Wal-Mart in the past 6 months. What you wrote was true, before the pandemic. Now they have a taste of online shopping, curbside pickup, and online membership. 

They are in a struggle with Amazon to be the retailer of choice for the next generation and the most important thing is Amazon is fighting wars against Netflix, EBay, Kroger, and a dozen other proven companies and Wal-Mart can singularly set its sights squarely on Amazon. They have the supply chain, purchase power, and reach to thrive under inflation. They already have private label cemented (Amazon is struggling here) and DTC will enormously effect margins to the positive side. They already have 99% of the American population within a one hour delivery window, a heavy investment in autonomous driving and drone advancement.

154,CC," I'm not sure about a crash, but the market will begin to re-price based on signals from the fed (ie. if the fed is buying less bonds, some market participants will eventually move from stocks to bonds). There's a lot of liquidity in the system, so people caught on the wrong side of trades that are over leveraged could cause a ""crash"", per se. Best way to handle this is to dial back on companies that don't generate free cash flow or sell CC (can only do this if you have x100 shares in a company) as a way to reduce cost basis and ease back in after market turmoil. SPY puts can get pretty expensive depending on your bankroll. Something that I'm watching is potential backwardation in VIX (ie. VIX futures expiring in August /VXQ21 are more expensive than VIX futures expiring in September /VXU21).",lillit_kit,1,/r/stocks/comments/oafplq/who_truly_believes_a_crash_is_coming_this_year/h3he9mc/,0.077,0.814,0.11,0.7465

Furthermore you are forced to hold onto the shares for longer  since you would have to wait out until the option expired unless you bought to close. Time is money and that money could just as well be re-invested in something else that has time to grow.

Many in the northeast had their shutoff moratoriums from COVID recently extended until this winter, which is then basically automatically extended until spring since you're not allowed to shutoff in winter/cold.  So they might be at nearly two years of back payments due from residential customers.  

If they deal with consumer oil/gas, the continued truck driver situation is impacting them.  Many gas stations in northeast are on an every other day kind of setup now instead of daily.

On top of that, they also started inking deals with the pentagon this quarter.  Having U.S. military contracts is the next best thing to having a money printer attached to your business.  Congress and the pentagon are well known to sign off on damn near any military spending in front of them, and they ask little questions about vastly overpaying for military supplies.  Getting into military contracting is going to be a HUGE revenue increase for them.

Tomorrow they will also be talking to investors about forward looking data.  They already in the process of building at least one new huge manufacturing facility, and no doubt they intend to sign more military contracts, so their revenue numbers are going to be looking huge not only from what they have already done this quarter, but forward looking the next year.",FunctionVoidBig,3,/r/stocks/comments/o9ugag/poww_potential_run_up/h3enwf5/,0.026,0.902,0.072,0.7199

Perhaps I'm misinterpreting what people mean by diversity? IF the idea is that many small positions is somehow always better than a few big ones. I disagree with that.

431,GM," Tesla's market share may decline but the overall sales would increase. EV's are only 2% of auto sales in America. No auto company is more prepared to take over the EV industry than Tesla. Factories opening up in key areas will improve deliveries. Look at what GM is doing. They found out that Chevy Bolt's are losing too much money so they are changing their EV strategy to higher tier vehicles such as the Cadillac or Hummer where the margins are higher.

I don't know where you are getting Tesla going into space from. Those are two separate companies. But think about this.... Elon Musk is trying to get humans into Mars. Do you really think he would lose the EV race to legacy automakers who sat around and jerked off all this time? GM plans to go full EV by 2035.... Tesla is full EV a decade ago. The point I am trying to make is that Musk and his team are simply way more innovative than these legacy automakers. I trust Tesla more to come out with new and improved products. Cybertruck and Model 2 $25k sedan out by 2023. Name me an EV company coming close to doing that for the same performance at a lower or comparable pricing.",Chromewave9,4,/r/stocks/comments/oa08jv/is_tesla_the_new_tucker/h3emwdp/,0.063,0.833,0.103,0.8841

433,IP," People are paying for the technology in a Tesla. The only real competition will be Rivian and Lucid. The other companies (except maybe Porsche) are just making electric versions of their vehicles. They’ll have enormous growing pains without the IP. 

The eventual market share is the entire auto industry, not just the 2% of electric vehicles on the road today.",bscirca1981,0,/r/stocks/comments/oa08jv/is_tesla_the_new_tucker/h3evpna/,0.045,0.893,0.062,0.0258
