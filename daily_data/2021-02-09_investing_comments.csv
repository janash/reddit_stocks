With USA legalization not being universal you are better off investing in Canada or an ETF like MJ.

In Oregon for example, many eastern counties do not allow the sale of recreational weed while much of the western portion of the state does. Despite it being legal to have in the entire state. 

With passage of legal weed you will have a new wave of smokers (even to try once) that were scared of getting arrested before.

I don't know if this is underrated, but if Tesla, Slack, and Etsy can get on the list I feel I can toss this on here. 

Stock got on my radar because a bunch of local realtor were switching from traditional brokerages over to this company. Upon a bit of digging, these guys are basically a MLM company for real estate. Realtors get benefits for recruiting other realtors, etc. etc. However, they seemingly have a boatload of growth potential - new markets they are expanding into and how many realtors they seem to be successfully recruiting. 

They are definitely valued for growth (about 4x sales and almost 200x expected earnings) BUT software based real estate sales has TONS of room for growth. The industry is seriously antiquated. They've done away with a lot of unattractive aspects of brokerages (no desk fees, etc.) and are seeing a lot of positivity from agents in my local market. Since I saw them getting pumped late last summer and threw some cash at the stock it has grown 275%. Less than half a year. 

Will it continue? I don't know. However this stock is ridiculous and I'll throw it into this fake Reddit portfolio to see where I can get on the list.

94,CEO," **IZEA** 

It's a company I've known for years. In a nutshell, they connect influencers with businesses who want to advertise through influencers. They've been around for around 15 years and the founder is still the CEO - that comes with benefits and detriments.

I think they have a good concept, but they've always been hampered by (a) lack of capital and (b) lack of focus. But they've now got $30 million in cash on the books and just announced another secondary at-the-market offering to raise even more cash.

Cash is important because they really need to invest in their platforms. They want to have an Amazon-style marketplace where influencers can sell themselves. But right now, their website is functional, but still needs some work.

Their bigger money right now is from contracts with major companies. Recent press releases indicate that those are doing very, very well over the past 4 months (but, you've got the founder still running the company - and he's a bit of a ""salesman"" - so there might be bad news that they're not sharing).

There backoffice is also a little bit messy (thus the need for capital), so they announce earnings really late. They won't be announcing Q4'20 until the end of March when the 10-K is due. But I think that they might announce a profitable quarter - which would be their first ever. I think that could really pop the stock and it's why I haven't cashed out despite the 3X returns in the past month.

They've also got a board member who has been buying stock, so that gives me some confidence.

I'm in at 5,000 for $1.80 at the beginning of the year, so the stock is up a lot already (at it's 52-week low is $.07).  But if they perform the way they have been telegraphing they will, I think there's still a lot of room to run.  If they announce a profitable quarter in March, I think it could go to $10 pretty quickly; and if they keep performing could double again in a year.

The company has just been unknown and has lacked direction so there was no viable story to attract attention.  They're starting to get that now, and as more investors start following the stock, the stock price should better align with the actual value of the company.",Bobby_does_reddit,5,/r/investing/comments/lg297f/second_quarter_results_6_months_into_the/gmq0htp/,0.047,0.859,0.093,0.9484

This a VERY important point that a lot of people miss.   I would wager that more than a few of the people that are advocating 100% in the stocks 100% of the time,  will do panic selling at some point in their lives.

Panic selling is worst.

Going 100% cash, then being afraid to get back in is next worst.

Going 100% cash prematurely is bad.

Just ignoring it all and doing nothing generally does better than the above.

201,APHA," It might seem like an easy arbitrage opportunity but it's not. When you hold stock in APHA to get a ~30% discount on TLRY , you are hoping one of these 3 things don't happen:

-	APHA doesn't drop down more than 30% in the next three months else you'd be losing more than the discount 
-	TLRY doesn't drop down below the current equivalence price before the merger
-	A combination of the above two doesn't happen such that the discount vanishes before the merger.

All of these are very much possible given both stocks have grown by over 170% in the last month. 

The correct way to play this bet is to short TLRY as a hedge but TLRY is already one of the most shortest tickers with a sky high interest rate. Also the puts have a hefty premium with IV at near 200%. This is likely what's causing the mispricing between the two shares for now. 

Personally, i exited out of my APHA positions this morning after an 80% return as it doesn't match my risk profile anymore and I think a correction is overdue given how the stock has been green for nearly a month now but there might still be plenty of money to be made if there's a short squeeze.",devOnFireX,5,/r/investing/comments/lgae53/apha_to_tlry_conversion/gmqoyv1/,0.015,0.867,0.117,0.961

248,EA," I appreciate your comment. However, I'm not doing any hit job. Let me elaborate further on rationale behind my notes on EA.

1. Stock price wise it is in good position just like almost every single major games developer. Due to stay at home orders all home entertainment equities had record quarters. This is not really specific to EA. If I had started accumulating before COVID I would probably hold but I would not start new position at this point.
2. Ok, Apex legends was undeniably major success and it's now pulling more revenue than Sims 4. However, if you look at recent EA's 1P releases its really disappointing. Battlefield 5, Anthem, Mass Effect were all received poorly by gamers and did not generate much revenue. Need For Speed franchise is kind of limping a long but is not doing much revenue wise. Let's have a look at what franchises generated revenue last quarter [https://ibb.co/qFyZqs6](https://ibb.co/qFyZqs6) The only recent 1P game we see here is Apex which is in highly competitive hero shooter battle royale genre. These games can rise fast but they can also fall out of favour very fast too. Slowdown in Apex revenues would have really negative effect on EA. Then we have Sims but its really not a new 1P. So we have 43b market cap games publisher that is unable to develop lasting 1P franchise and its living off 3P licenses that can be pulled away. Meanwhile I see smaller studios developing profitable and well received 1P franchises. In my opinion that's a failure and EA must do better here.
3. We had outright ban of loot boxes in Belgium and we have law suit in California regarding loot boxes. Governments are slow but things are happening in this space. Now you right, there are not massive moves here. However, let's look at EA last Q slides again. [https://ibb.co/S0PxYxb](https://ibb.co/S0PxYxb) Vast majority of their revenues are from Live Services (i.e. loot boxes and few DLCs). If EA had more evenly distributed revenue we could say, theres not much going on, its just few countries we don't need to worry. However, since EA is very heavily reliant on loot boxes, or booster packs or player packs or however you want to call it, any regulations in this space could be very damaging to EA's revenues so I think it is correct to be hyper sensitive here in regards to EA.",Ironleg01,3,/r/investing/comments/lfn127/electronic_arts_to_buy_glu_mobile/gmon52t/,0.071,0.818,0.112,0.9109

256,ATVI," First of all, I really believe that you cannot time the market and if you think EA is a great company you should just buy and DCA and all that so don't feel like you missed the train and buy. I personally don't believe that EA is such amazing company where I must get in no matter what. However, it's not the worst company either and with gaming sector in secular growth it could be ""rising tide lifts all boats"" kind of play so if there was a big dip I would buy.

Having all that said, I actually believe there will be many dips to come. If you look at any gaming company they all been doing superbly this year. ATVI, TTWO, CRSR, ZNGA, just everything to do with gaming did very well last year. This is of course because of COVID and stay at home orders. However, I think that means that this year expectations will be very high and with lockdown easing and economy worsening there are many chances for EA to slip up and deliver slightly lower earnings which would result in correction downwards. Then if there is any action from Gov on loot boxes, keep your eye on that. Then EA has to successfully absorb Codemasters and Glu acquisitions so in the coming quarters if expected growth doesn't materialise keep an eye for that because analysts certainly will. Then we don't know much about upcoming Battlefield 6 but after losing exclusivity for Star Wars EA is very keen to launch and promote franchises based on their own IP. They are really 100% behind BF6 this year to release it in the best shape possible. However, the most important thing for EA is not to sell base copies of the game but to maintain recurring revenue from micro transactions aka live service. There is a lot of danger that EA might push a bit too hard with live service thing to optimise revenue and game could flop like BF5 did. And then there is Apex and EA really places a lot of hopes on Apex. They been mentioning it several times during last earnings call. They are launching Apex in Japan  on Switch soon and expect major revenue boost from that. And then launch in China after that (regulatory approval pending). If these launches flop or if revenue doesn't materialise or even if new battle royale game comes out and steal users from Apex that would definitely wobble EA's share price.

I, myself, find many reasons not to invest in EA at current valuation. I personally need more margin of safety in share price.

285,BB," I’ve been investing for only a few years, and haven’t really experienced a major correction yet. I would appreciate any feedback, stories or advice on how to survive the potentially impending correction. I don’t have much but I’m nervous, nonetheless. 

A couple of specific questions:

1.) Do you just hold through it? 

2.) Do you move your money to something more stable like an ETF or blue chip stocks?

3.) Are there any types of holdings that would be less susceptible to following the market in a sell off? Would international funds or stocks tank less, for example?

Right now I have 4 shares in Disney, a couple of all the ARK funds, FMIL, VEU, BB and an assortment of penny stocks that I’ve gotten lucky with.

286,AMD," So I am thinking about investing into AMD, and I wanted to get the opinion of people who know more about it then me, because I am pretty new to finances. Basically my thoughts about it are that with the new 6000 series, it should overcome NVIDIA on the GPU market. As AMD is also producing the chips for the PS4 and the PS5, 2021 will be profitable too, since the PS5 will take over the markets. I feel like Lisa Su will skyrocket the company in the next years.

But like i said in the beginning: am I right? Can anyone who has more knowledge over this stuff than me confirm ms thoughts? And if not, what stock should I invest into on a long term?

287,CORE,"  

I  am a 19yo and maxing my 401k with 85% VTWAX and 15% ARKK. As for my  401k - my employer contributes 7.5% for free without any matching from  me. It's only a job through college so that 7.5% won't be a whole lot of  money, but why not set it up properly.

The fund choices in my 401k, and recommended allocation are as follows:  

https://imgur.com/a/ABeC8Ff


As to what I want to know

1) Are either of these allocations reasonable?

Ben Felix Inspired: (Main option for now)

DFSIX  - DFA US SUSTAINABILITY CORE 1 (50%) DFSPX - DFA INTL SUSTAINABILITY  CORE 1 (25%) DFVEX - DFA US Vector Equity I (10%) DFCEX - DFA Emerging  Markets Core Equi... (10%) DFGEX - DFA Global Real Estate Securit...  (5%)

My initial choices:

60% DFSIX 30% DFSPX 10% DFCEX

2) Should the sustainability funds be swapped for:

DURPX - US High Relative Profitability, DFIEX - International Core Equity

I  chose sustainability funds initially because I preferred their top  holdings and sector split, but that may be a really stupid way to  choose.

3)

Could  either of my allocation choices be way better with the addition or  subtraction of any available fund on that post in the screenshot.

Specifically Small Cap Value US and Small Cap International Funds, or International Vector Equity?

A third option could be to place all of my 401k into small cap value, and emerging markets to ""tilt"" my overall allocation in those directions. What do you think?

Anything else I'm missing?  What's my best option?

Objective is saving for retirement. Time horizon is 40 years. High risk tolerance (I doubled down in the 2018 and COVID crashes), losses don’t scare me at this point in my life.
Holdings: 50% VTI, 25% VXUS, 25% VUG as far as my main investments go.
Is it worth rebalancing to try to reduce my large cap growth exposure? It was not initially designed to be such a large part of my portfolio but has grown way faster than my other investments which is certainly not a bad thing! However, I’m concerned that this rapid growth has priced in future earning’s growth and will lag compared to my other ETFs in the short to medium term. As someone in IT I truly believe in the future growth of many companies held by VUG but i know that’s not always 100% correlated with stock growth.
Due to tax idiosyncrasies this year I would be able to sell most of my VUG holdings without paying any LTCG tax, but I doubt that opportunity will present itself beyond this year. That’s why I’m wondering if it’d be a good time to rebalance and try to get back to a 2/1 ratio of VTI/VXUS.",WePrezidentNow,2,/r/investing/comments/lfz96p/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gmpjilf/,0.052,0.784,0.164,0.978

295,AMZN," Hello guys,

Because of some career changes (working in medical field) I will have about 1.5 years with more ""free"" time while on the job (way more on call time) and want to use that time to finally get into investment and trading.

I'm not just looking to learn ""buy AMZN and forget about the money"" or ""buy a penny stock and hope"", but obviously to learn about options, a bit more risky investments, how to value stocks and using all the data I can get my hands on. All in all the bread and butter of trading and later more specific stuff. 

I have a good amount of money to invest and will begin with smaller amounts.


Native German speaker, but my English is pretty good, so I would prefer German sources, but English is very welcome too.


I looked through coursera.org but primarily found courses on general or specific finance, not primarily about stock trading.

Best would be a mixture of video/webinars and text, but I take anything I get.

I'm thinking of at least 20+ hours, I want to feel at least somewhat safe before really investing.

If it's not a free course, that's okay, but then I would love some insight on it, not that I spend 100 bucks on a shitty course.

296,BP," I'm looking to invest 10k with the view of liquidating up to 7k by next January. My initial plan is 1k BP, 1k bitcoin, 2k airbnb. That leaves me 6k. I was thinking of spreading this across stocks based off a pie on Trading212 called 'diverse growth portfolio' which is made up of 38 individual stocks, featuring predominantly tech but has a few renewables, an airline, a hotel group etc. I am thinking about contributing 1k a week for 6 weeks into this portfolio to reduce risk.

I understand that it's not always the best idea to invest in stocks for the short term, however, I'm in my mid 20's and can afford a bit of risk. The idea is that if, for example, I achieved a 20% ROI then I could liquidate the 7k and leave 5k in there for long term growth.

The 7k makes up a portion of a house deposit (~17% of my deposit). However, I wouldn't necessarily need to liquidate the full 7k, as instead of contributing to these investments throughout the year I can put money back into my savings, resulting in an additional 5k into premium bonds over the next year (basically borrowing money off myself to invest into the market earlier as opposed to drip feeding money in whilst it is essentially losing value in premium bonds due to inflation etc), meaning I may only need to liquidate ~2k by January 2022 and the rest can stay in there longer term, or be reinvested accordingly.

299,CEO," 32 year old science teacher from the US. New to investing. 7k in car loans that will be paid off by March month. My wife has 10k in school loans, but those should be paid off by August. I’m super new to investing. I think that’s good enough info?

I flagged COVID being an issue for schools to my district’s CEO in Feb 2020 (it fell on deaf ears unfortunately). Looking back, had I invested in certain businesses that have done well during the pandemic, I think I could have done well. That ship sailed and I missed out on the opportunity to buy low.

After seeing graphs on how the variant caused a spike in certain countries and listening to experts (CDC, Dr. Winston Campbell, WHO), seeing a few cases pop up in the US, I believe the South African variant will hit the US hard causing a spike. Some vaccines are not as effective and I think this will contribute to the country going through a scramble again. I don’t know stock terminology so I will say this in science terms hoping one of y’all can correct the terminology. I think the variant will cause a fast natural selection/ punctuated equilibrium of certain businesses like it did in March 2020 (businesses most effective will survive and make money). I’m wondering what I could invest in now that will grow in the next 2-6 months? I’m also guessing travel for leisure/vacation stocks to decrease and maybe it would be good to buy those and see it grow in a year or so when life normalizes. 

Anyone investing right now due to the South African variant or... do people not look at stuff like that when investing?

I just read Tesla IR Report for Q4 2020 and saw that Q4-2020 Tesla have Net Income of 296 Million USD (OCF / Cashflows From Operating Activities).While Proceeds from issuances of common stock in public offerings, net issuance cost is 4987 Million USD (FCF / Cashflow From Financing Activities).

Does this tell us that Tesla is actually made more money from selling stock issuance/right-share rather than operating profit? And i’ve also see an upward trend(2020 splits normalized) that Tesla’s share count & cashflow from issuance of common stocks (FCF) increasing YoY since 2017 — 2016-ish. I dont have any problem with stock issuance because its up to their management to decide whats best , but does this means Tesla actually raised more money selling shares rather than cars?

Fairly new to trading but something that caught my eye is UAVS. They market Themselves as drone software for agricultural applications but their recent spike in price has me wondering if they can expand that to other areas of the market? 
Small team based out of Kansas but they have good results from what I was finding on their website. I think they could really take a foothold on how drone technology is used. Seems like more & more of labor jobs are being replaced with machine labor.

The unmanned aircraft aspect is interesting to me because it sounds like there is the possibility for job growth on the production side as well as the “piloting”. The company seems ambitious so if they can garner the resources they could really establish themselves.

Anyone else take an internet?

313,RH," Hey guys!

I initiated a transfer request from my Robinhood to WeBull account on 2/3 (last Wednesday). In my portfolio, I had about 2,000 Shares of $SENS, 10 $SENS Call Options expiring 2/19, 200 Shares of $TTOO, and 100 shares of $ZOM. Since the transfer, I have been restricted from trading; which was fine because all of these were long positions for me anyways (aside from the options), but I was still able to see all of my positions.

This morning I got a notification that my ACATS transfer was cleared and would  be completed on 2/11. When I checked my Robinhood account, all of my positions, aside from a small amount of $SENS shares, were gone and not showing. It was a little disheartening to see ~$10k in my account dip down to $1.4k, but I assumed the other positions would show up in my WeBull account and be available to trade on 2/11. They weren't and I'm worried that my positions were liquidated during the transfer aside from the remaining shares of $SENS that are still in my RH account.

1. Why are those shares the only position showing in RH?

2. I understand that fractional shares are liquidated on transfer requests and that is a risk with Penny Stocks. Were all my shares that are not showing up fractional and thus liquidated? What about the contracts I owned?

3. I have tried to get in touch with both WeBull and Robinhood to see if I can get an overview of the transfer that happened. Unfortunately, they have not gotten back to me and googling answers has led me to fruitless results. Is there any other option to see if I can find what positions of mine were transferred over?


Tl;dr I transferred brokers from Robinhood to WeBull on 2/3 and was notified that my transfer cleared. My positions which were once showing on RH are not any more aside from 350 shares of $SENS. My transfer won't be complete until 2/11 and I'm worried that my positions were liquidated.

7%: VIOV 3%: VFSVX

Or

10%: Some of the riskier ETFs like ARK variants? Any suggestions here? The ETFs I see thrown around are ARK variants QQQ and VOO (any others to consider?). If going for ARK, I'm thinking of evenly splitting between the 5, thoughts?

My question is: When does that extrinsic pricing happen to the put option?

Record Date is 2/18 which means Ex-Dividend Date should be 2/17. Right now a $60 Put option expiring 2/19 cost me $3.20.

Imo you should never jump on a hype stock especially on reddit without doing research and establishing exit strategy AND entry strategy. Knowing when a stock has run up too far for safe investment is something we all will gauge differently, but it's doubly important to think about that when it comes to highly volatile stocks which are soaring.

Schwab tends to be known for fee-free international ATM withdrawals if you were interested in a side account for that

Fidelity is the only one of the three that offers HSAs if you had one and wanted to eventually consolidate to one brokerage then that would be a nice plus

The market is a bull market if it is going up. Someone is said to be bullish if they expect something to go up. The opposite is a bear. A bear market is one that drops over 20%. Someone is bearish if they expect it to go down. I do not know the origin of these terms, but there are ways to do well in both markets although a bear market is significantly more difficult for a normal investor because it requires betting against the stock market which is generally more risky and bear markets are shorter so timing is difficult.

Based off the idea that hopefully a majority of the stocks can be held longer term I'm hoping I can use this to my advantage and liquidate the required amount (hopefully only 2k depending on the above) by picking and choosing individual stocks (based on their current and predicted future performance) at the time I require the cash.

435,IMO," I used to agree with you, but unless your purposefully picking the high dividend ones, I’d do the etf.  I can tell when the market in general is gonna go down (don’t believe media lies that it is impossible) but can never time individual stocks.  Unless you are buy and hold forever then you’re going to have a hell of a time picking which ones to keep or sell when the market gets frothy, like right now.  Better to just have a fund you can sell a little of.

I’d also love to warn OP about what they consider a growth stock.  All of those stocks have the growth in the rear view mirror.  They need to find new stocks.  But everyone here is convinced they will keep precipitously rising

IMO at Nasdaq 14000 people need to be concerned more about loss aversion than hoping stocks that have already been hyped up and pumped up for a year will suddenly have another huge pop, and no profit takers",oyveyanyday,1,/r/investing/comments/lfz96p/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gmowa7x/,0.11,0.714,0.176,0.9244
436,GME," It's more like... if you think a stock is going to go up at a later date, you are buying the option to buy said stock at a predetermined price (strike price).

The premium ($115, which is 1.15 x 100, in the user's example) is what you're paying for the right to buy 100 bananas at $4 each. You can either buy the bananas for $400 and turn around and sell them for $600, or you can sell the contract to somebody else (they both will probably net you a $85 profit either way). If bananas went up to $5, you can still buy the bananas for $400 and sell for $500, but you're at a net loss of -$15 ($5 - $4 - $1.15). Obviously, if the bananas dropped to $2, you're not going to buy bananas at an inflated price. You just lose the cost of the contract, the premium.

The main benefit is if something goes bad with the stock, you only lose your initial investment (the $115 cost of the option). You can also sell your call options before they expire if you think the price has peaked and you're happy with your return (i.e. if you had an option for GME that had months away, you might think that the stock peaked and won't ever be worth more, so you sell your option to somebody else).",_token_black,1,/r/investing/comments/lfz96p/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gmqg98n/,0.069,0.886,0.045,-0.7003

508,AMC," ""What is a liquidity flywheel? A liquidity flywheel is a situation where inflows into an asset class lead to buying pressure that pushes up prices, leading to favourable apparent return and volatility characteristics in the said asset class. This favourable outcome then attracts yet more inflows, leading to yet more buying, etc. Conversely, poorly performing asset classes with significant downside volatility can lead to investor redemptions, leading to forced selling that contributes to yet further price declines, yielding even worse returns and even greater redemptions, and so on. This process can go on for years, and sometimes even for decades, and is a fundamental contributor - perhaps the most important contributor - to both major asset-class bubbles, as well as asset price busts and secular lows that lead to fire sales prices (which are 'anti-bubbles' driven by the same drivers of bubbles in reverse). The disconnect between the ultimate owner of funds and the at-the-coal-face investors actually engaged in individual security analysis is fundamental to this process, because end investors have little to go on other than realised investment returns and volatility, and it introduces both information asymmetries and agency conflicts that can drive radical market inefficiency."" (https://lt3000.blogspot.com/2020/07/market-inefficiency-liquidity-flywheels.html)

TLDR: People saw hyper growth funds up 100%+ last Fall, chased performance, piled more and more money in, driving more returns and more inflows, Ark posts its trades every day (""OMG WHAT IS ARK BUYING I ALSO GONNA BUY WHAT THEY ARE BUYING!"") which pushes prices further and drives more Ark performance and more inflows. Flywheel keeps spinning and people get so enamored with performance that they get complacent and think it can only spin one way.

Also: thought this from Cathie Wood was kind of interesting.

'The bond bubble is also being fueled by private equity and its ""amazing"" how private equity will continue to leverage up even mature companies, Wood said on ARK's monthly webinar.

And it's equity markets that are bailing bondholders out of their mistakes.

""Like the GameStops and AMC, the moonshots that they’ve enjoyed because of call buying and catching hedge funds offsides, what we’ve seen **there is a company like AMC, whose bonds were selling at 5 cents on the dollar ... they have moved up to 80 cents,"" Wood said. ""Why have they done that? The move up in the stock gave AMC the opportunity to do an equity offering.""

""Who will be left holding the bag if AMC goes bankrupt?""**

**Stocks are not in a bubble, *but there are ""a lot of value traps evolving*,""** Wood says.""

515,LPSN," Intercom, LiveChat, and Zendesk I would say are their main competitors, with Zendesk being the stiffest competition as they are much more capitalized. What I like more about LivePerson is that they are entirely focused on perfecting their customer messaging experience as opposed to phone customer service which Zendesk and others provide, so I think this gives LPSN a first mover advantage. Many people will tell you that they still prefer talking with a human over the phone as opposed to messaging a bot but this will become less of a concern as the problem-solving capabilities of these algorithms continues to improve. In the end however, I think both companies will succeed.

564,GME," > This just seems like a perfect short squeeze scenario if you ask me.

Obviously watching what happened with GME gives us all dreams of finding the next huge short squeeze. It certainly led me to do some research on the topic. What I found makes it look like I have a better shot of winning the lottery:

* Most short squeezes are characterized by mold intraday price increases with priced normalizing by the next opening. Unless you're sitting watching the ticker everyday to identify the rise and sell you're not going to profit and if you do the average return would be pretty small. Most short squeezes aren't nearly as dramatic as GME. 

* More often than not, the shorters are correct. High short interest is usually predictive of price declines, despite possible mild squeezes during the decline. There's a ton more research on the potential returns from shorting high short interest stocks (or excluding high short interest stocks in a long only portfolio) than there is on capitalizing on short squeezes.",big_deal,3,/r/investing/comments/lg8zhk/dd_lately_ive_been_looking_at_skt_58_short/gmqb68z/,0.013,0.803,0.184,0.9837

573,IMO," I think the problem lies in getting the future generations to learn how to build wealth (disclaimer most of this will be opinion). IMO the worst thing for children is to get everything they want.  As a parent it's hard not to do that if they financially have the means. But if you're born into a wealthy family. The concept of earning and growing money is foreign to many, because they've always had it and believe it will always be there. So they don't bother learning HOW to accumulate wealth,  because they already have it. And if they've grown accustomed to getting whatever they want because money is no object they pay little attention to growing money. 

Similar to how most lottery winners go broke within X amount of years.  They don't manage money.  They see a big chunk of it sitting there and assume they will never burn through it. Same with future generations getting handed wealth. When you never really struggled and actually built financial independence you generally have little clue how to keep the ball rolling.  Even middle to lower middle class people who say through an inheritance or life insurance of 50 or 100K through a death.  Don't know what to do with it. Maybe they pay off all their debt or mortgage or whatever.  But they continue living the same lifestyle that got them in that position. And however many years down the road wind up in debt again and no better off. So in order to pass wealth on (barring the 1% folks with hundreds of millions or billions).
