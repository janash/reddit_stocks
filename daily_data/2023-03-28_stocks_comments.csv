Just because something is the future or obvious doesn't mean you will make money investing in it. Companies exposed to AI had an incredible run the last few months already. 

Airlines were no doubt the future since 1930, but they have produced a net negative return for shareholders. After the railway mania in the 1860s, it took 115 years until the net return turned positive for them. 

That doesn't mean that you can't profit from clear trends, but you either have to be very early - or buy companies that will benefit from the trend, but are not the clear picks and shovels. 

For example you need computing power, so semis seem like a good bet - but they are overvalued. Now you look what goes into Semis, and see that most companies that supply semi stocks are also expensive. So you look what they need. Do that until you find a company or sector that is very cheap and very much exposed to the trend - but where most of the people dont pay attention.",DartFanatic,6,/r/stocks/comments/12464pz/ai_investment_play_due_to_apiplugin_integration/jdzbyt8/,0.086,0.815,0.1,0.6359

130,AI," I think we’re about to see a new wave of innovation thanks to AI and Apple will definitely have a role in this space. Particularly, I think voice assistants are about to get incredibly intelligent, on the same level as ChatGPT and Bard - and because it’s apple, Siri will likely be tailored to each user based on the data in your iCloud. 

I still have friends that are ditching their android phones and moving to the apple ecosystem. I don’t expect revenues to explode but even if they hold at this level, Apple will continue share buybacks and grow its EPS in that way, which inevitably raises share value. 

I’m not investing for their VR promises as I think this market is still very niche and probably a decade off till it’s used in every day life. What I am investing in is the continuity of their business as is, because there’s nothing that’s currently over the horizon to stop it.

138,UI," No, I've used a few of their products. I find their UI to be overly simplistic to the point it infuriates me. Both on iphone and Mac. They tried to make it so simple, that it's overly complex. Nothing is where I want it to be. 

They don't interact well with non apple products too. Also, that proprietary ""lightning"" charger that costs twice as much as every other charger in the world.....maybe I don't want to use icloud! It's not that great. 

The iPhone features are always about 2 years behind the android equivalent, but apple does a better job marketing, so they pawn things off as fresh. 

They rave about their styling, but make everything so fragile you need to cover it with a case, so who cares?!

Their stores strike me as so pompous I feel sick inside them. It's all about image and cool instead of getting me the stuff I want. And why is there ALWAYS a line there? What product is worth waiting in line for?! Maybe the occasional game or movie, but there's always a line!!

And their stuff is always 30-40% more expensive than the android or PC equivalent. Even if I get one did product in my life, I can replace it and still spend less than the apple version. 

 I've never had virus issues on PC, and I've been using them for almost 30 years. So, that seems like marketing hype. Also, I can't imagine the process to add RAM to a Mac. You probably need to be wearing a turtleneck and beg a genius for help....
