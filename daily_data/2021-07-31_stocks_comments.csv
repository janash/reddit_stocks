6,IMO," I personally stay away from oil as much as possible. I hold some as a result of ETFs, but beyond that I don't trade them. For me this is less about morals and more about economics. I don't think oil has a future. In 30 yrs we will either be killing ourselves with global warming or burn much less hydrocarbons. Either way the industry is headed downhill.

Tobacco I don't explicitly avoid, but I think it's a similar market. The largest markets are abroad. With development those markets likely shrink.

I have quite a lot of money in defense, however. While I don't agree with US defense spending and the need to involve ourselves everywhere, I think that's a change that needs to happen in the American people and in congress. In the mean time these companies are just intermediaries on government contracts. The companies don't decide use. Same as any other government contract. I have a problem with US defense spending, but defense contractors are the result, not the problem IMO. Beyond defense many of the big companies have other business which is poised for future growth.

Ultimately my reasons tend to be economic. I think morals will likely be reflected later.",rock00888,9,/r/stocks/comments/ov6n59/does_anyone_else_have_a_moral_obligation_not_to/h775w7b/,0.076,0.833,0.091,-0.4557

10,STAG," I wouldn't say moral obligation to not invest in certain sectors or stocks, but I would say I personally have a moral obligation TO invest in local corporations, climate change, water preservation, land reclamation/preservation, and mining. All of which you can do from the convenience of your phone. Me personally I would much rather invest in something like above than your average stock because at least you know you are not contributing to the problem. Yes I understand the controversy of investing in mining, but certain metals are vital to the reduction of carbon; copper is a great example. For instance a great etf I would recommend is PHO, not only will you make a killing in 10 years, but you will be directly contributing to water preservation/retention. There is a lot of good you can do with the stock market and investing especially at a local level. I live in the south east US, so I own a REIT called STAG which owns a lot of the warehouses/land in my city. Same with Regions financial(RF), they are everywhere in my city and provide a lot of jobs so I invest in them.

18,FB," I don't agree with virtue investing, although I admit I do it myself.  The goal of business is to make money for the investor.  Moral and social responsibility is not a part of the arrangement.   It cannot be if you want to remain competitive.  The least moral company will ultimately win the day and the market.

That being said, the way I justify my moral weakness is that I say that these companies have serious political risks.  I.e. if society ever decided enough was enough, they could be slapped with regulation and forced to change their business model.  In actuality, this is not a real risk in our current political environment, although apparently it is in China. 

Interestingly, however, if you look at these companies, it seems like most investors do in fact have a conscience when investing though.  Look at companies like Nestlé and FB.  They consistently underperform their peers and it seems the only reason is that they have horrible PR.  Are they undervalued as a result?  Probably.  But when does investor sentiment shift to not giving a fuck?  It's likely investor sentiment will grow more dire as major societal issues caused by sociopathic business practice get worse.   

So until that trend breaks, and it won't any time soon, as things will continue to get worse for the forseeable future, I see no reason to take a chance on companies I personally find despicable.

Because battery mining is awful for the environment, there is no solid procedure for recycling them and of course the electric they use comes from wherever an individual nations power comes from, which is still largely fossil fuels.

Using electricity in itself is not that bad, even if it was all from a coal plant over the life of an EV it will emit slightly less than an ICE car, however when you consider the battery they actually become worse than ICE vehicles. Nevermind that the materials for the battery are hardly in infinite supply, it will shrink massively as EVs become more popular. 

Hydrogen is a far better way to go rather than EV or ICE.",efrost55,1,/r/stocks/comments/ov6n59/does_anyone_else_have_a_moral_obligation_not_to/h78idzm/,0.065,0.853,0.082,0.2831

Like spamming a hundred posts sure maybe that's a pump attempt, but it was a single post that gained traction before it was taken down. In terms of the factory not doing anything, that's not true. The current two factories (one in China, one in Germany) are both real. Last year they did about \~$100 mil in revenue selling to CHN and others. This year they announced they are selling to gaussian and a few smaller names (and are suspected of working with Daimler and Oshkosh). The only thing I can think of to substantiate 'smoke and mirrors' is that since the german factory just went up and is not at full capacity, it is not macking cells, just packaging them (china factory does both), but Microvast has been open about this and that plant will soon make them in addition to packaging them (not I mean package battery cells on manufacturing lines, not like just put them in boxes like dropshipping).

In terms of bear cases the top is likely tought competition, but imo since there will definitely be a battery shortage in a few years, this won't matter as much (and MVST has strong R&D).

90,TV," Yes. The forebearance is artificially pushing up prices. (Read “where have all the houses gone” NY TIMES) 

More than likely the foreclosures will be bought en masse by a hedge fund and all be turned into rentals. That what happened after ‘08. It’s unfortunate because it does not reset housing prices at where they should be. (Read 
https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/02/blackstone-rental-homes-bundled-derivatives/) 

This is how it’s done. All in the name of helping people always. Like ‘08. Look at Clinton’s speeches about how low interest rates which bailed out the tech bust were supposed to help more people into home ownership. Housing more expensive than ever with less individual owners. You think people would learn by now the government doesn’t have their best interest at heart but dangle a free color screen TV, a year of Netflix binge staycation and a narrative by The NY Times/Facebook about being downtrodden and they don’t question it. It’s very sad what people define as winning.

I saw some plan at some point California was talking about letting tenants have first crack at buying their foreclosed upon landlords home. That made me equally as sick. The people that caused the landlord to lose their home by withholding rent would get to buy it with help from the taxpayer?

everyday renters will get more poor, because they have to pay to move AND pay more in rent at the next place and probably have to reduce quality of living.

If nothing else I see landlords missing the boat this time around. Everyone is expecting the housing to peak and collapse. When in reality we are NO WHERE near any peak. The people who are buying today are going to be making big bucks and the game will keep rolling on because of the 1031 exchanges that require you to buy something for $1+ more to roll over your coat basis to the new property.

153,ICE," People are making the mistake of investing in shitty startups rather than the players with the cap ex and distribution channels to push cars. Further, the industry is stymied for now due to a lack of EV infrastructure. If you're buying, buy companies that are already turning a profit and hold for at least 5 years. EVs will become more prominent as charge ports become widespread, particularly if this infrastructure bill comes to fruition in the US. Ford and VW are my personal choices for an EV play, but be warned that they will likely lose revenue on ICE cars in the short term as they grow in EVs. Tesla was the tip of the spear for EVs the past few years, but I personally think it will wither when Musk leaves as CEO so I don't have any holdings there.",xflashbackxbrd,1,/r/stocks/comments/ov7y58/is_the_ev_market_still_viable_or_wait_a_few_years/h77tyil/,0.082,0.881,0.037,-0.7509
154,FSD," Autos in general are not worth much TBH.  Look at ford market cap, look at GM.  I know Tesla's market cap is sky high but it more or less got squeezed on WSB like a year ago and has been sky high ever since.  Its also because of the FSD that Tesla has, not just EVs.  There are other EVs makers.  But Tesla's FSD has proven to be the market front runner for true FSD software.  They have thousands and thousands of cars on the roads using it, testing it, sending back error reports and feedback.  Thats a huge advantage over the competition who are still doing beta testings. 

The implications for FSD are massive and transcend just being a car company.  Think of the whole trucking industry, the whole chauffer, uber, ride sharing industries.  You could eventually have Teslas made just to be taxis in cities with a tesla taxi app.  and these trucks would never need breaks, don't need health insurance and can work literally 24/7.

201,THC," I think wanting to wait is completely fair, growth is quite stretched right now.  I'm waiting for a bit of pullback myself.  

I think your point about it being oversold is possibly true. I can't comment as I haven't done enough research on that point.  If tobacco is able to pivot to THC products,  that would be a real and significant opportunity and have growth come back to the companies.

Another thing to possibly think about is that if your are giving equal weights to all stocks in your portfolio,  you might end up overweight tobacco, and it is possible that all 3 companies will trade in a very similar manner. If you value diversification, your portfolio might end up less diverse that it appears.

The PDT mark will not go away on its own and eventually your broker will restrict your account if the balance stays under $25,000.

212,GDP," Bless your heart.

According to the BEA, the Q1 2021 GDP growth rate for California was 6.3% about in line with the overall US rate of 6.4 percent.  The Texas GDP growth rate was 4.3.  

The 2021 GDP for CA is $3.2 trillion, while TX is $1.8 trillion.  CA's GDP per capita is $81,870, while TX is $64,470.

In addition TX has some of highest poverty rates, highest teen pregnancies, highest uninsured (healthcare) and one of the poorest education systems.

I'd suggest holding off on uncorking that bubbly.

So what you should then determine is if this stock will rebound.  Maybe people thought the wait was too long, or the bankruptcy danger is too real.  But then you DD those 52 low stocks and find the one where the market is over reacting.  Thats your value play.  You say you know this company is still doing good revenues.

Idk, maybe I am crazy but when I read all the tech companies were allowed to claim last year's profits with a c for COVID next to them on their balance sheets even though they lost gobs and govs of cash, I realized this is all a complete shell game that could very well be broken by a combo of social media, trading apps and the pandemic. Actually, I figured that out months prior when I realized that the same bank that owns/owned WeWork also owns the buildings that WeWork rents and so the bank was basically trying to pay itself to rent to itself at a premium but in actuality the bank is renting the building from the Chinese or something. That bank is JP Morgan, true story.
