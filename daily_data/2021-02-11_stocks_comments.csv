6,BY,"  

I've only lately had some incredible success and I have just a few rules that I am now iron-fisted about:

1. Take small positions at first.
2. Double down or pile in the ones that go well and sell the losers.
3. Cut your losses short.
4. Let your winners run.
5. Be  very aggressive with a small amount of money that you can afford to  lose. You might be surprised how this small amount becomes large.

I  loosely base these rules on and learned them from the classic story  about the Turtle Traders. See brilliant book by Michael Covell:

The Complete Turtle Trading: How 23 Novice Investors Became Overnight Millionaires

Like  everyone I do beat myself up about the ones that I got into, saw a loss  and exited quickly. Like \[\[REMOVED BY BOT\]\] at .50. Now at 3.05.

But then, for my own mental health, I had to realize that I wouldn't have been able to make that major investment in GME if I had not done so well at building on what I had from the beginning.

8,DD," This is great advice.

I almost purchased a bunch of GME in October 2019. Was at $2.50 I think. I told friends this recently and they asked me why over a year ago I’d look at a retail store with zero online presence?

On the rare occasion that I’d go to the mall, I’d always pop my head in and there were were always people in there. They were surviving in a time that made no sense.

Don’t know why, but I passed it up for some reason. I put the order in, then cancelled it. I now have the cancelled GME order that would have paid off all my debts.

Never again. If something is more valuable to me at it’s listed price, and I do my DD and things look good, I’m buying.

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance and click view all. Check 50/200 MA + Float that the smaller the better and prefer under 100M. Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign. Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day.

89,EV," Personally, I look at trends and try to find early stage companies that will sell into growing sectors.  For the last few years I have been into electric cars and related tech, and since I have a background in mining I'm mostly looking at future suppliers of lithium, nickel, and graphite.  There are many early stage mining companies trading for pennies that are pre-feasibility.  Not all of these will get funded or turn into active mines but those that do are very likely to see a 20x increase in their share price.  It takes years to finance and build a mine so this isn't a short term bet, but I'm holding a few to see how they do.

I also just invest in safer bets, like EV sector ETFs: ARKW, ECAR, IDRV, DRIV.  These won't be 20x but are unlikely to go to $0 (which the mining stocks most certainly can).",PhotoKaz,1,/r/stocks/comments/lhn99g/how_do_people_find_stocks_before_they_explode/gmz1ml3/,0.0,0.874,0.126,0.9548

92,CAN," Disclaimer: I'm not advocating this method or pushing this book. Just sharing info. 

The book ""How to Make Money In Stocks"" by William O'Neil is all about answering your question. How to find the winners before they become big winners. The book teaches you what they call the CAN SLIM method. You can google it and get an overview of what the method is about. This is NOT a value investing method/book. This is a book about growth, and how to spot good stocks right before they boom. A big part of it is analysis of charts and spotting trends/signals/""bases"". The book has about 200 charts of stocks from their study period that boomed and exhibited certain bases, so that you can see many examples of what you're looking for. 

My opinion on the method is mixed. I think the method, in theory, is solid. I think some of the pieces of the method are really hard for a normal retail investor (like myself) to successfully complete. There are a very, very small number of stocks that ""fit"" the criteria of a successful stock using their method, which means you're going to have to put a TON of time into research. Having said that, even if you don't follow it to a T, I took a lot of really good information away from the book.

94,SP," You don't. However, I do believe that in-depth research into a company, both looking at fundamental analysis and TA, can give you reasonable suspicion that a company will do well in the long term.

Take for instance, Blackberry, which is a turn-around company now focusing on software applications. They are producing software for EVs, IoTs, and other security focused software. I'm sure you have seen the many posts about it. The problem is that revenue is not where it needs to be--it hasn't proven that it will produce revenue streams to justify a boom in value as a company. The partnerships are there, but not the revenue. Not yet. People who are bullish are hoping it is a stock that explodes. But no one can predict when or if that happens. If it does 'explode', it might happen between this year, or 5 years from now. Same with Tesla. Look at how long it was talked about before it 'exploded'. The SP remained relatively low until it suddenly took off. If you bought it two years before 2020's run, you would have bought in thinking that it deserved to explode, but only seen the stock price stay pretty level for a solid two years. No one predicted the exact day it would start its epic run-up, but perhaps some people did suspect that it could happen.

Anyone who says something will surge up in stock price within a short-time frame is either full of it, or is from the future.

look at tesla, it was clear that EVs were the future but then you need to figure out what company is going to succeed of the few dozens that were going to try and fill that gap, some have flat out failed and only one is as profitable as tesla

If there's an upward trend, and the stock starts to see even more buys than normal, the trend continues. This peaks the interest of the readers, and perhaps they buy more of the stock. So in a sense, a board such as Reddit could affect the rise of a penny stock rapidly.

143,ANY," Thank you for posting this. I've found it's also useful to think of it in terms of gambling following your same logical progression. I've played a lot of blackjack and found myself falling into the same trap early on. Oh, what if you had hit and got that ace? Spoiler alert, you didn't. What if I had stayed? Well, ya didn't, *and there's literally no other choice you could have made* that would have got that card on the table in your favor. The biggest thing I learned, no matter how literally or figuratively you take it, is this:

*NEVER gamble drunk*.

I’m currently a Bag holder at GME, I’ve invested before but I got too late into GME and instead of letting it slide, like i usually do, the fear of missing out kicked in... it’s not like I would have made millions our even thousands, but I could have made +100% +50% +30%. I could have just taken the profit but I was blinded by the memes. 

I lost some money but, I’m not sad about it, it was money I could afford to lose, and the ride was still fun.

145,PS," A better choice is not defined by the expected value because it does not takes preferences into account, a better choice is defined by comparing expected utility functions which are dependant on the expected value but show properties like risk aversion which arent reflected in your analysis. 

That’s why some people prefer investing more in gold/bonds and others more in high volatility options, and both choices are “better” for each one of them. There’s not an objectively universal better option, yet there is an objectively better option for each individual.

146,AMC," I think this is the main thing.

With GME this really bothered me, being an absolute newbie to stocks but not to logic, this all just got messed up.

First we have the massive gains. Yes of course people bought in at 10, 50, 100 etc and sold at 350 for massive profits. No doubt about. And yes they shared those profits, good for them.
Second we have loads of people who bought in at 359, because one can only see at 350, if another person bought it. So for every person who profited, we have someone who is down massively.
Third a lot of these new buyers have no clue what they are doing, so even if GME rises again, even if it goes high, who do they think will be holding the back when these shorts are gone? Because every experienced person who made this their (part-time) job, will know when to sell, and will be able to do this quicker, while the average joe will come home to find the stock plummeted after the shorts are gone.

Of course some new average joes will profit, but for the majority it will be the (rich) experienced trades who make the money.

Now obviously new traders will have a tougher time, when to buy 1, when to get out. But normally you wouldn't learn this with like a 75% loss.


I had been interested in stocks for a while now, when GME blew up it really peeked my interest, it's absolutely insane. In that insanity I decided I wanted to join in. But I went the AMC route when it dipped, because if AMC doesn't pan out now, it will still bw good longterm. Sadly for a lot of individuals the bigger memestock was GME, so they went there.

Oh and of course so many people who lost their savings or money they needed elsewhere, they were truly just gambling, because you are playing a game that you know nothing about, yet went all in...

I hope GME goes up, just to prevent the loss of so many people, but there are already so many individuals who lost so much, pretty sad.",CrazyGunnerr,7,/r/stocks/comments/lhbs9l/the_trap_of_resultsoriented_thinking/gmxe8z9/,0.1,0.743,0.157,0.9763

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance and click view all. Check 50/200 MA + Float that the smaller the better and prefer under 100M. Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign. Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day.

156,SQ," Hopefully, that comes as an expensive lesson. You're 20, you'll recover in no time and by then this might just be a fun story to tell in the future. If you have trouble with FOMO, I seriously recommend sticking to broad ETFs or index funds. 

Personally, I invest looking for long-term growth. People don't realize that the stocks that spike up often are a stroke of luck and hindight is 2020. For example I had SQ. AMD, and PLTR which all surged but I never invested in them thinking it would ""moon""; they were just overall good companies with good potential.

162,GME," I bought in to GME when it was $30. Sold at like $140 literally an hour before Daddy Musk tweeted. Went back in because I wanted to ride the wave. Average of 170. Haven't sold and don't plan on selling at these prices. 

However something I have learned in my 1 year of trading is to always sell enough stocks to make sure I can recover my initial investment, ESPECIALLY when the stock is volatile. I have my initial investment of GME and the money I invested when it was $170 was all house/gain money. So even if it goes to $0 I still have the initial amount I invested. And if I sold now I would have a pretty good return for the amount I invested.

You have to be careful when dealing with stocks that run on hype. I believe GME got cut short when the rules were bent to save the hedge fund, but that's besides the point.

This is a lesson/reminder to a lot of us to sell for a profit. Even if it keeps going up, securing the bag is always a good move. Or atleast secure your initial investment cost, to make sure you can continue making moves.",Cubed_Legend,2,/r/stocks/comments/lhs005/message_to_other_young_investors/gmzdw2z/,0.008,0.857,0.136,0.9719
163,MSCI," I for the first time invested about 7000 Euros into the stock market when the Coronavirus hit. I bought Tesla, Ballard, a few others and a bunch of ETFs. I will hold this long term no matter what happens, because that's what I told myself I would do when I started, friends told me I should sell Tesla when they hit 900 Euro pre-split, I held. I have those stocks and ETFs on a Depot where an order and a sell cost 10 Euro fee and that is intentional, because I don't want to move it around at all. When I saved up enough to make a purchase (I only make purchases above 400 Euro because of the fee), I'll buy it and hold it there; I'll generally add to my positions when they go red and I'll only ever buy stocks I think will play a big role in the future. I also invest monthly in an MSCI World ETF and plan to do so for the rest of my life. I recently put 200 Euros into a low-fee trading broker to play around with and lost half of it to this MJ hype. You're still young, you can make up those losses if you don't chase the quick money. If you really want to gamble do the same as me and set aside a little bit for that purpose but never sell a good company to bet on red/black. My overall Portfolio is +130% at the time of writing, but I wouldn't sell anything of what I own even if it was up 1000% or down -90%, because I believe to know the stocks and ETFs I picked will go up long-term.

I think GME was unprecedented and resulted in many people not acting rationally.

GME was a trade, and if you weren’t in sub $100 you were gonna get burned no matter what. Because the fundamentals don’t lie.

207,SELF," Personally, ""investing"" has really helped me. I used to be a huge sports gambler. I wouldn't describe myself as a ""degenerate"" but there were two times throughout the decade where I bet over my head with a bookie and lost money I didn't have which is how I know exactly how you're feeling. When I got involved with the market, I promised myself I would only invest in the blue bloods like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon ECT. Anytime I got the slight urge to take some risks, I reminded myself of how I felt when I lost it all, twice, gambling lol. After a couple years, seeing the hard- earned gains I've made utilizing patience has taken away that gambling side of me. I don't think we have a ""sickness""..some people are just born risk takers lol. You just need to learn to control it. You lost a sh*t ton of money and you chased it. Every gambler, sickness or not, has been there. Every single one. What makes ""degenerates"" different is that they don't learn from their mistakes.

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance and click view all. Check 50/200 MA + Float that the smaller the better and prefer under 100M. Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign. Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%.

The people who saw 1000+ gains probably also had a lot of anxiety over their ONE stock pick just crashing to 0 one day.

It's much easier to replicate 20-30% each week (especially in this market) to reach 1000% gains eventually...than it is to gain 1000+% from ONE INDIVIDUAL stock that may take years to come to fruition.

280,TSLA," TSLA is an interesting case study for risk in stock investments. The issue is not whether it’s going to deliver on its potential but whether you NEED to take the risk that it doesn’t. Even if that risk is small in your opinion it is still vastly greater than the risk inherent in owning say apple, Microsoft or google which have already established their potential. 

A potential pitfall for TSLA holders is being emotionally involved with the stock and missing the opportunity to make a life changing conversion from a single stock ultra high risk mega growth win to a high value lower risk lifetime income portfolio.

What a lot of inexperienced investors don’t understand is you can be dead right about a company and yet still see your investment value wiped out for a decade. Depending on your financial position it could be better to sell off at least in part and consolidate. Coming back in 10 years will not be much buzz if your investment is the same as it was when you bought it.

Obviously a lot is dependant on one’s current and ongoing financial position but for me chasing vast gains from a stock that has already delivered vast gains, faces vast competition which is slowly bringing its guns to bear on its marketplace, and is already valued beyond any reasonable measure is a bit like running through a minefield to get to paradise beach.

That's a really good question. By far the weakest part of my DD (IMO) is the competitive analysis / understanding of moats if any. That's an area which I do intend to brush up on so my plan is definitely to try reviewing a few competitors to find out what other opportunities there are in the space.

1. Great question - by far the weakest part of my DD / analysis is the competitive landscape analysis. I personally don't think TSMC is a good benchmark here as the foundry services offered by ON aren't the / shouldn't be the primary draw and it's not really a ""pure-play"" org. IMO, the competitors I'd be looking at are Texas Instruments, Diodes Inc, Broadcom (to a lesser degree), Infineon and maybe Qualcomm. Unfortunately, due to time constraints I haven't got as good a grasp on this one as I should have. I'll certainly be looking into this as a next step along side just doing more general research on competitors.
2. Potentially this was poorly explained. Essentially they are selling fabs that have historically been relatively low margin. Yes this reduces capacity (at least short term), however as the new fab they have built is brough up to speed, they expect the capacity to increase overall. Additionally, the new fab promises to be higher margin, allowing them to improve overall FCF / NOPAT. The current expectation is it should be up and fully running by 2023. I think there is some technological advantage to this as well. The fab they're buying is an existing GloFo (Global Foundries) fab that manufactures on 300mm wafers. This new fab will allow them to transition from a number of 200mm wafer fabs to the new one. I think there's also some CMOS technology licensing / knowledge transfer taking place but that's not really been an in-depth focus for me.

With GME, the stock price was never a reflection of their fundamental value. It was just a pump and dump artificial spike to screw over other investors. GME as a company had nothing to do with that.

Weekstocks are similar. When you invest in them, you are expecting regulations on weed to change in the US. If they do, the companies will likely do well. If the regulations don't change, then your investment won't be worth much. 

If you want to gamble with those kinds of things, go right ahead, but that's a very narrow viewpoint in my opinion.

560,GME," Oh.

I did a shit job of explaining the point I was trying to make. Sorry. 

It's taking a risk on short term stupidity for a big gain with long term as a back up. 

Hedging, basically (implied odds on a flush draw if you're a poker player).

To explain:

TLRY has had massive, consistent momentum for several days. 

It's is irrational. It is pervasive. 

And it just hit terminal velocity yesterday when the story hit the major news. 

It's the new fad now. Fad buying will ensue.

So today is likely the final explosion (or one of the 3 or so final explosions) of dumb money chasing FOMO, profiteers from GME buying more stock because they have money to burn, GME bag holders trying to break even, some guy who caught the news last night and hates his boss and wants to quit. Frenzy.

Real talk, if it hit $100 today, I wouldn't be surprised. 

It's up over 10% in the first 29mins of pre-market trading. It won't hold there, but that shows the lunacy of the momentum. It's trading like GME without nail biting swings.

Anyway...

If that is all wrong and it doesn't blow up, it drops from $65 to $30. Maybe $25. Sad face emoji. 

But the bigger narrative is legalization. And the merger. One matters. One is an exciting catalyst that will make people buy because they get excited.

Those will result in big jumps (I traded in the Canadian legalization market so have a bit of faith in my understanding of how the hype plays) which, I think would take you to overhyped land again.

So, if you try a short term play to earn money from the irrational buying right now and screw up, you can hold and get back to good. 

Best case scenario, people get really stupid. They hype the stock now, it sustains a stupid price, then blows up when merger is finalized and then blows up for legalization (in whichever orders those occur). Like $300-$400 territory. Will definitely not happen. I mean tiiiny chance it could. 

This isn't GME. There is an underlying proven value to the company, a merger on the way, and it will be the largest company in (what is kind of) a new sector of the economy in the U.S. (I say kind of because pot has been legal in some states).",ideapit,14,/r/stocks/comments/lhfyjo/rstocks_daily_discussion_options_trading_thursday/gmx7l9b/,0.088,0.781,0.131,0.9688

&nbsp;

The proliferation of 4G LTE networks, the deployment of new 5G networks, and the pervasive nature of Wi-Fi are driving a dramatic increase in the number of RF bands that smartphones and other mobile devices must support. And with the coming of IoT, those bands will be more congested than ever! Each band must be isolated using filters to avoid interference that will drain battery life, reduce data speeds, and cause dropped calls. RF filters are nothing new, and have been a part of mobile devices since their creation with 1G phones and those old wireless handsets we had at home before the advent of cellular tech!

&nbsp;

What makes this unique is that 5G needs to be ever more isolated from other bands to ensure signal reliability and strength. $RESN is at the forefront of this tech for 5G.

&nbsp;

Here's a link explaining the congestion in RF bands, a bit physcis-y..

580,DD," I was doing some follow up DD on this. I think RESN is a high risk high reward play. 

Looking through their financials, they're in quite a weak state right now. They burn about $20M in operating expenses a year. During their IPO in 2018, they raised about $20M and raised about $9M in 2020 through private offerings. Currently, per their Q3 2020 10-Q, they have enough cash to last through Q2 of 2021, not that far out from now. 

I tried to find some information on 5g roll out to see if Resn can grow significantly enough while meeting their cash needs, and I can't find a great answer. One random website I found states 5g will be more widely adopted by 2023 internationally, one year beyond Resn's current FS capabilities. I do not believe that website considered any potential covid pullback in development either. 

Resn is earning revenue based on royalty. It appears to be a prepaid amount of $9m with Murata, exclusive until March 2022. This is bad news because they need to increase revenue by 10x in order to be a sustainable company at their current expenditures. Their only hope is to find enough bankers to push the through the bad spot with some miraculous forecast showing how ISN can earn tens of millions in the next few years. 

The upcoming 10-k will be very illuminating. If their most recent financing is really small, this may indicate fewer people believe this company will take off.

Based on what you've sent, I read some more to try and understand XBAR and ISN and their competitive advantage. An article on seekingalpha states Xbar is attempting to replace fbar in the market place (a Broadcom and Avago product) using ISN to help integrate it in the market faster. Ultimately, I'm unable to truly understand why ISN and Xbar are unique, with information being scarce/vague or technically barred out (i.e. reading the patent filings). The products of themselves do not sound revolutionary to people like me. ISN simply sounds like a data driven / AI driven approach to implementing RF to products, which bigger companies like broadcom will have more data to run with. I cannot decipher how Xbar competes over Fbar either. 

Speaking on mass production, I am very curious how they will go about manufacturing. If they are sourcing out to another manufacturer, they may ramp up production quicker but with more costs. If they require custom or special equipment, the manufacturing process may not be online until 2-5 years out. This means the liquidity risk isn't quite solved by the ATM offerings and they may miss part of the 5g roll out.

If they require custom or special equipment, the manufacturing process may not be online until 2-5 years out. This means the liquidity risk isn't quite solved by the ATM offerings and they may miss part of the 5g roll out.

585,RF," I can't believe I missed those two points in your post. Goes to show reading DD late at night is not the best. 

Based on what you've sent, I read some more to try and understand XBAR and ISN and their competitive advantage. An article on seekingalpha states Xbar is attempting to replace fbar in the market place (a Broadcom and Avago product) using ISN to help integrate it in the market faster. Ultimately, I'm unable to truly understand why ISN and Xbar are unique, with information being scarce/vague or technically barred out (i.e. reading the patent filings). The products of themselves do not sound revolutionary to people like me. ISN simply sounds like a data driven / AI driven approach to implementing RF to products, which bigger companies like broadcom will have more data to run with. I cannot decipher how Xbar competes over Fbar either.

586,DD," I actually think that MOST DDs that come are late to the party.

Here's a rule of thumb. If you see a DD and then you go on your preffered site to check the stock, switch the view from 1 day to 5 days /1 month and even more and all you see is a pool of green and an arrow going up with no chill, congratulations. You are most likely a future bag holder.

Here's where it gets funny. From time to time comes a DD on a company that the OP says it has potential but when you go check the stock...crickets. No uptrend, looks stagnated, etc. THIS is a make or break. ""Looks like shit, what if it doesn't go up"" ; ""Hmm, looks risky"" ; ""What if it never catches steam?"". Trurh is, you never know.

637,IP," I work in a cGMP facility that collaborates with companies in the pre-clinical phase of this pathway, what we do is help these companies complete pre-clinical data accrual (usually pre-IND animal studies, sometimes larger animals), do tech transfer, SOP development and control, engineering and manufacturing runs at small scale, IND application and approval, then scale up for phase 1/2 clinical trials. We also have our own IP that we manufacture and are currently in around half a dozen phase 1 trials with that. It's a nightmare, the best advice I can give is never invest in a company stock that's being floated on any data prior to phase 3 and at best your gamble on phase 3 or 4 data is still a 50/50 prospect. If you're placing a bet on a company based on phase 1 or 2 data you are probably 5 years from seeing that company having a marketable product if it makes that far. The ONLY time you might have a faster process is through EUA or compassionate care approval, something like the COVID vaccines and various treatments, which is quite rare.",SnukeInRSniz,2,/r/stocks/comments/lhaidu/a_look_at_the_fda_approval_process_and_how_it/gmwg1fk/,0.0,0.848,0.152,0.9806
638,ATOS," Interesting write up. Especially since I hold over 200 shares of ATOS at a slightly higher than I would like price ($3.50). 

Not that losing 80% of $750 is a detrimental, life changing loss, but if there’s a good reason to reduce now; better to do it and break even.

639,LOW," Do you mind if I ask your opinion on $SPPI? Spectrum Pharmaceuticals?

They have a neutropenia drug that was deferred by the FDA due to COVID restrictions keeping them from being able to inspect the manufacturing facility. 

I'm holding 1k shares. Reason I even heard about this company was a recruiter had told me about a job posting (I'm in pharma sales) and I checked their website and they had recently posted jobs that indicate (to me anyway) that they were about to hire a sales force. 

They have several AMGEN guys in the C-suite and a quick look at their investors showed a bunch of bigger institutions long.

I understand that you can't possibly know every company but I figured any insight I can get is worth it.

I did my own research and invested an amount that I'm ok losing. Reason I'm asking is because this falls into a weird FDA category that probably has never happened before. Meaning, not a rejection, not an approval, not a request for more information, but a straight up deferral. Good news is I picked it up LOW.

640,ENLV," Wow very nice write up! This was perfect timing since I have been watching ENLV for a while now. I was thinking about pulling the trigger tomorrow since their offerings brought the price down and I can buy at the dip. They are done with phase 2 of a drug that helps patients with severe covid. It can also help with sepsis which is the number 3 killer in the US. Their results look fantastic. Have you heard about them or think it's a less risky buy vs others with lower result rates?

641,ATOS," I am a huge proponent of pointing out the ATOS is a terrible investment. It's really good as a short term hold right before a decision (well, everything is in this market). But if you look at their actual products, not a lot to be truly optimistic or excited about as a long term hold. This is more a buy the hype, sell the news stock.

642,ODT," I truly appreciate you taking the time out of your day to research a company on the fly like that. 

What really sold me on ODT was how consistent the growth has been over the last month, and it’s hit the $40 mark multiple times in the last couple years. I would probably dump some at $35 and just let the rest ride up until it starts to fall (assuming it repeats the same pattern).

654,GME," I don't get this shit. People lost money on GME because they are stupid and hopped on the train way to late. 

There was a ton of DD's on GME and the possible short squeeze when it was around 10$. That's when I bought in. After seeing more evidence for the short squeeze happening, I doubled down when it was about 35$. At that point I thought I was pretty late. But what on earth could move a person to buy in when the stock is at 300$ plus, when it was at 40$ a week prior.

655,POWW," I saw the news earlier, I was indifferent on the company before (Seriously has anyone ever seen or even shot their ammo?) but this is pretty big. They are building a new plant, lots of new gun owners and overall national politics good or bad should drive this up. Bad gun stuff on the national stage? More buying albeit induced by panic. Increased demand. Good gun stuff on the national stage (ha, right) more buying and more people shooting. I haven't shot for awhile, mostly due to covid and being busy but I also don't want to shoot what ammo I have, shits expensive. Retailers are charging twice or thrice what ammo was a year ago. Edit; Holy shit, prices are significantly worse than when I looked last. Some of the ammo listed on ammo seek is going for near 4x pre pandemic levels, wow.

656,POWW," Some context on POWW ( I’ve been in since 2.33).

They were fully backlogged with orders months back IE they had more business than they had ability to do anything with.

They reported record profits and then immediately reinvested the profits into greater manufacturing capabilities.

This new news is even better as it seems they are continuing to invest in growth. Kinda wish I had bought more than the 333 shares I have of theirs but they’ve treated me greatly.

Def believe in this company long term. Their tracer bullet ammo has tons of military interest/contracts.

Right now, the lower courts have been beating up California’s extremely strict laws, and the Supreme Court has ruled that the second amendment guarantees a persons right to carry a gun. Which means that people have the right to carry it, and own it and would take something extreme to overturn.

I haven't seen the part that the supreme court stated it's a right to carry a gun. They did say it's a right in the home for self defense. They also stated in another case that the states must have a program that would allow approved individuals to carry, but they never said it was really a right - look at MD and NJ.",giant_g2,1,/r/stocks/comments/lhrpbm/poww_ammo_inc_announced_they_are_buying_gunbroker/gmzelxy/,0.087,0.859,0.053,-0.5262

26 737 max deliveries in January and assuming 121.6m per plane is true from Google then they could be at ~3.1B in revenue from commercial deliveries alone in the first month of q1.

Analysts are estimating a high of 15.9B in revenue for q1 and if the pace continues, commercial deliveries can account for 9.3B by itself. 

Haven’t even taken revenue from services and military portions of the business yet. 

I’m willing to bet on a big revenue beat for q1 and hoping for a big eps beat (which will be the important metric imo) as well

A word of advice. Make any investment an exclusively financial one and you will minimise your losses. The case for BB within the current and next Q is quite reasonably bearish given it’s here by virtue of the bull raids being carried out by retail traders. 

Also telling people to sell a stock that was priced at $8 a month ago for $1000 is somewhat more irresponsible than telling people to sell a stock that has seen a 50% increase in valuation with scarce developments or information regarding the restructuring of BB relative to its $8 valuation at the start of Q1.

787,OR," When buying call options you are betting the price of the stock will rise. “But why don’t I just buy shares if I think the price will rise..?” Rather than betting on a stock by simply purchasing shares, option contracts allow you to pay a small premium for the RIGHT to purchase stock at a certain price. Call options are great because if a stocks price doesn’t go up as predicted, your only loss will be the premium paid for your option.

Simple way is to think of it in terms of buying a house:
You want to purchase a house that’s currently $100,000 because you think it will go up in value sometime in the future. 

Option A: You buy the house immediately for asking price of $100,000. In this situation any profit/loss will be determined strictly by the market value of the house.

Option B: Let’s say you don’t have the capital to in the moment OR you want to ensure that your losses are minimal should the market value of the house go down. Because of this, you open an option contract with the realtor who’s selling the house. 
This contract lets you buy the house at $100,000 (strike price) anytime in the next year (expiration date) for a fee of $10,000 (premium). 


Now let’s look at two different scenarios...


Scenario 1 // Market value of house increases to $120,000 after one year:
      - In option A you would have profited $20,000 had
         you sold the house.
      - In option B you would have profited $10,000.
        Your contract allows you to purchase the house 
        at $100,000 even though the market value is 
        $120,000, however, you must pay the $10,000 
        premium for the contact, thus making your 
        profits $10,000. 

Scenario 2 // Market value of house decreased to $80,000 after one year:
      - In option A you would have lost $20,000 had you
       sold the house 
      - In option B you would have loss $10,000. Your
       loss is limited to the premium paid for the
       contract. You would not execute your right to
       purchase the house at $100,000 as it’s worth less.


Everything stated above can be applied to options trading in the stock market, just replace the house with a share of stock.

While you may make more profit if you outright purchased shares upfront and sold at a higher price compared to purchasing a call option, you face a much higher loss risk should the stock price go down.",RyansLand,1,/r/stocks/comments/lhdrza/call_options/gmx5pwg/,0.049,0.832,0.12,0.9788

It’s main application will be semi-trucks as they can’t be stopping to charge a battery during their shipments.

Apart from a few companies most have terrible quarterly earnings reports, this time also they are running up on expectation of being legalized in USA. If this happens or not we are not sure but either way after this hype is over, reality will set and most of them will fall again 90% down.

871,EV," Tesla is currently battling falling market share in China by slashing prices and aiming cheaper models at Chinese consumers. So that situation is fluid. It doesn’t look good for Tesla, tho. Its competitors are growing faster than it is, and they are in many cases producing better, more desirable products while doing do. 

If you want a current analysis of the state of the competition right now, you should google “tesla china market share” and use the “tools” feature to select only articles written in the past month. But I consider that a waste of time because all you need to know is that Tesla has quality and safety problems with its Chinese consumers to know that the company is not in a position to maintain its current production without addressing these quality of build problems, much less increase production. The Chinese government isn’t like the US government and will not allow Tesla to continue to sell its cars with severe safety and quality problems. If Tesla doesn’t find a way to fix its current quality of build complaints problem in its Chinese cars, it will either fall farther behind its Chinese EV competitors as it slows production to improve its quality of build, or it will have its market share cut by order of the Chinese government if it has to take unsafe models of its cars off the road. It is conceivable that Tesla, with its massive capital, could pour almost unlimited resources and talent into its production to improve quality of build, but then it will be building cars at a greater loss, and that would take its earnings in the opposite direction of the earnings growth its high P/E demands. 

All of these weaknesses and flaws will prevent Tesla from pulling off a successful defense of its market share. Tesla never addressed its poor quality of production culture in the US factories and now that problem is apparently creeping into its Chinese factories even though the quality of build of Chinese-built Teslas were supposed to be better than its US-built Teslas. The poor production quality is a problem of Elon Musk’s leadership (Google “tesla production hell”). There aren’t many ways for Elon Musk to overcome all of these flaws that doom Tesla’s market share and earnings growth, and this us why he’s going to have to increasingly come up with creative stunts like the Bitcoin thing, to distract investors and cover the company with “Next Best Thing” marketing tactics as it falls behind as a auto maker.
