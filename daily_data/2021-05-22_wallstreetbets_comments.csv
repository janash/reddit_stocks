66,UI," 
This is a stupid question, but are there any active class action lawsuits against RH? I lost several hundred dollars last week between their glitchy UI and costumer service. They withdrew  1.2k from my checking account when they were supposed to take it from my RH balance. I bought shares before realizing what they had done and then they sold some of my positions without speaking to me in order to refund my checking account. I‚Äôve read similar stories online. 

Another time, they sold all of my position on one stock when I requested less than half of the shares to be sold. Their costumer service was very stern in this instance, basically saying I had no evidence. Now I screen record every transaction with them. 

I want out of RH but I don‚Äôt want to leave while I‚Äôm down. I‚Äôve been down since they openly conspired with Melvin and Citadel to shut down squeeze. 

There are other complaints I‚Äôve seen that seem to imply RH is operating beyond the boundaries of certain laws. 
 
I see posts about suing Citadel over the GME squeeze. It seems to me that RH is much more vulnerable than Citadel. As for me, I would just like to annihilate RH from my financial reality and the rest of the planet.

That means the hedge funds borrowed the stocks highest price.. Also some how they shorted more shares then even exist..

318,LNG," Start with googling Charif Souki. He pioneered and created the US LNG export market when he built Cheniere. That company is now at $80 a share. Souki was pushed out of Cheniere by Carl Icahn because Souki wanted to keep expanding and reinvesting money into the business, whereas Carl Icahn wanted a dividend paying company. So Souki started his own company where he‚Äôd be in full control. Tellurian is on the verge of signing deals which will allow them to start construction on their LNG facility and associated pipelines. Tellurian will one day be bigger than Cheniere. Souki is out for blood.

Is this your DD? We have already seen $420+ on the 1st week of this month and $405- during the 2nd week. Next week has 5 trading days and considering todays closing price of $515, it's a 1.02% uptrend to cross $420 or 2.41% downtrend. A fluctuation of 1-2.5% in 5 trading days is very normal for SPY and you do not need to eat crayon to say that.

You say W shape? There is no W shape in that chart. If you forcefully try to make a flat line between 14th, 17th and 18th to a point, it doesn't become a point!

200-day MA is never being touched in last 9 months

100-day MA was touched twice and it dipped below that line once out of two times which means 50% probability.

348,UWMC," True, but OTM is where lambos are funded as 10K stretches a lot further so you own many more options.

OTM is also the place where savings can be destroyed.

With 10K I could buy roughly 50 calls for Sept @6, or I could buy 660  $20 calls.  If it rockets up to $25, the $6 calls would be worth $50 x19x100 =95,000, but the $20 calls would be worth $330,000.

Granted, I don't think that far out of the money is realistic for UWMC by September, but it's a higher torque bet, with a lambo payoff.  But, I could be wrong and have left lambo money on the table.  It takes cojones to make a bet that far OTM, and I applaud that, sorry to OP that it didn't work out.

Not possible. What upgrades do you propose haha. I cannot think of a worse design. They would need to throw everything out and start over. And they have little to no talent, they are still using Burt Rutan's designs.

Airframe needs to go. So fragile it disintegrated from suborbital stresses. So fragile the windows are tiny to avoid breaking it.

Needs a real engine. (Rocket Motor 2 is a disposable hybrid engine. Similar to a very very old school SRB.) Cannot be upgraded for much more efficiency or Dv. Needs completely new engines and a new airframe to hold the tanks.

Needs a heat shield and new material. It's carbon composite. When it gets hot it retains the heat and the resin will get soft. Meaning that the ship will have a bad day coming back.

Needs a real rocket to get into orbit. (SpaceShip 2 is 18 meters, Falcon 9 is 63.)

Oh and Dv is a function of initial over final mass. If your initial mass is heavy, your ship will not be efficient.

New Shepard on the other hand will have its engines stolen for New Glenn's upper stage. A real rocket.

The business model is ancient, streaming services are eroding the new release hype in theaters, profit margins are thin if the sodas have to cost $6, downsizing operations is a painful and difficult process, and it's a business that will get continuously hammered by recession or other economic downturn just like cars and hotels.

435,CB," Turkish stock market is a terrible bear market since 2013 in dollar parity. The index came from $500 to like $150. It only seems like appreciating because of the bad monetary policies like keeping interest rates irresponsibly low for political gains and causing hyperinflation in the end, plus large trade deficits mostly due to energy dependence. In reality, the index can't catch up with inflation.

Fed is both better equipped and politically more independent than Turkish CB. Even if they weren't, people would flee to gold and less inflationary foreign currency and stock market would have troubles catching up with inflation. Solid companies that can increase their earnings percentages in an inflationary environment too.

Tito5000 maybe think 6% is a high level on unemployment.

He's wrong because it's not a cause even if it helps, it's more than anything a consequence:

* Inflation has not started. When it starts, as prices and salaries rise, people will all be forced to go to work.
* 6% is a low level of unemployment, if you live in USA you may think it's high, but in most countries it's considered very low.",Fruity_Pineapple,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nil2m3/hyper_inflation_is_going_to_happen/gz2ryul/,0.183,0.796,0.021,-0.8705
