7,IP," Thanks for clarifying that patent expiry is driving the R&D. The other issue in a pharma company's R&D pipeline is that potential drugs are typically patented a year or two into its R&D development. This starts the countdown to profitability. Completing R&D and bringing a drug to Phase trials can take anywhere from 5-10 years, so a drug may only have 11-16 years to recoup R&D costs and turn a profit. 

In the past decade, drug development in ""riskier"" disease categories (by this I mean the biological phenomenom underlying the disease is still relatively unknown) has been pretty much passed to startups. Once the risk of failure has passed (typically end of phase 2 or phase 3 trials), the company will either be purchased outright or have their IP licensed by bigger fish. These pharmaceutical startups are the riskiest of all the biotech plays, because they generally live and die by a single class of drugs. You have to really know the biology and the state of the field and be willing to take on a ton of risk.",pleasegetoffmycase,3,/r/investing/comments/nufdp4/biogen_biib_drug_aduhelm_aducanumab_approved_by/h0xqz34/,0.075,0.855,0.07,-0.2023

15,UI," I've always liked Spotify, but I haven't really looked into the stock at all, so I'll explain my thoughts on the actual app.

It's UI is pretty amazing and they're top of the board in music streaming. A lot of people I talk to with Apple music say ""I wish I had Spotify, but I can't move my playlists over"". I also only know one person who uses YouTube Music.

They're also working on a lot more features, like listening groups, where Spotify users can join a listening session together and each person can add or remove things from the music queue. It's still in beta (I think, because there's bugs and I vaguely remember Spotify saying it was a work in progress), but it's still an incredibly handy feature and I don't think the others have that yet.

To your point, I think other companies not having to make money through it is why you should consider Spotify in the first place. Think of Netflix and other streaming services as they're in the same boat as Spotify. These guys actually have to try a lot harder for their customers, and thus will put in more effort. 

What I'm saying is, because they only make money from that one area, they're going to be incredible competitors in that area. Additionally, things like ""The Emmies"" will affect all music streaming platforms, but it will affect Spotify the most because of this property as well.

I can't, however, just jerk off Spotify without actually mentioning faults as well. Their family plan is cheap, it's fifteen dollars Canadian for five accounts; that's three dollars an account. Standalone accounts I believe are still ten dollars. I've heard quite a bit about problems with Royalties and how they often don't pay enough to musicians, though I don't have any sources on that really. I do remember a lot of musicians pulling albums and songs from Spotify until they got that remedied.

I'm also reading that they're practically dominated by licensing firms, so that's a pretty large downside.",FlamingRadish,2,/r/investing/comments/nu3wrs/should_spotify_be_given_a_spot_in_a_stock/h0xv71a/,0.018,0.858,0.124,0.9889

I think they’re trying to do this, but who knows if they will be successful. But if you think they will be, then yes it’s a good investment.

42,SPOT," I'm going to throw my 2 cents in and say it's not a valid view (I don't own any SPOT, but I'd buy it if I had money lying around for long positions).

Music is worlds different than movies and television. Spotify only really has 1 competitor in Apple Music. Redditors will argue for Tidal, Amazon Music, Google Play Music, etc, but they're not actual competitors just because of sheer population of users. They don't have the features, the libraries, or the numbers. 

Spotify's quality, library, and arguably marketing exceeds Apple Music's. Everyone I know pays for Spotify or Apple Music. I can't believe how many comments are about using the free version. I listen to thousands of hours of music a year, I couldn't imagine having ads between. I'd shoot myself. 

Spotify provides the best (or second best, if you're an Apple Music guy) library of music for the average person. 

You also can't split up music like movies and series. People don't mind flipping from Netflix to Amazon to Hulu to watch different shows. Not a single person is going to shuffle apps to hear different artists if they start branching off. 

The only case I see against Spotify is financials (I think they'll figure it out) or if you're SUPER bullish on Apple Music taking everything over.",TheBigShrimp,9,/r/investing/comments/nu3wrs/should_spotify_be_given_a_spot_in_a_stock/h0x56h6/,0.055,0.81,0.135,0.9707

45,TV," I get downvoted quite often for my upfront opinion. I will likely never pay a sub unless the ads get out of control. For the moment, it's fine to listen to free stuff. You can still make playlists too.....  


They listen to me which is creepy. I'll talk about bathroom remodels and then all the sudden I get a ton of ads on it, so it's definitely harvesting data like Facebook. Music industry is tough when it comes to paying out the artists, I'm skeptical on achieving financial goals on their side. They've added music videos to it which has been a nice addition. I like the karaoke add too (well, you can listen to lyrics so if you wanted to, you could display it on your TV so you can do karaoke at home).  


I think it's way better than Pandora and Apple, but with Apple as competition and how that industry shifts I'm just hesitant at these levels and overall levels of the broader market.

47,MGM," I don't think it would work in the music industry.

63,CBRE," While I think your thesis is wrong for a variety of factors, but I was replying to the guy above talking about buying puts on commercial real estate REITs.

Re: your thesis, CCI is clearly not holding the assets you thought it was. Also, If the market crashes and commercial or residential real estate is worth significantly less than it is today, REITs (holding those assets) share prices will likely weather the storm much better than the holdings themselves. ESPECIALLY REITs that have rental or services income creating value (on top of the value of the real estate holdings themselves).

Re: the guy above mentioning CBRE and CWK. Both of these companies make substantial revenue from real estate services, so even if there is a market decline in the value of their holdings, or if their occupancy or psf rent goes down, their share prices will be much more resistant to a big drop. Also, both of these companies have strong management that would be able to take advantage of any industry wide shakeup.

IMO the big players in this market are more likely to benefit from a market shakeup at the expense of small landlords who own a handful of buildings or fewer (and you can't short those guys - the most likely to go bankrupt).

I stand by what I said: shorting cashflow positive, profitable businesses with good management is a sure fire way to blow up your account.

Also the risk / reward of shorting CBRE or CWK or another similar cashflow positive profitable commercial REIT is super high. There's no chance they're going bankrupt even if there's a steep decline, and there's significant upside risk if they deploy cash to gobble up market share.

TL;DR: my recommendation to you (if you believe commercial real estate will see a steep decline and over correction) is to hold cash and wait for that to happen, then buy calls or shares in strong REITs that are then underpriced.

One example is SPG. Everyone freaked out about malls at the start of 2020 but they kept their dividend and recovered significantly. I bought a shit ton of SPG at $50-$60 during the first few months of covid and unloaded it around $90-$100 (current share price is >$130)

This may be due to comments by Janet Yellen over the weekend, that higher interest rates would be ‘a plus.’ My thoughts on this in the audio, don’t feel like typing them. It follows a ‘just right’ non farm payrolls report on Friday that led the S&P to approach record territory once more.

This week is going to be all about the inflation report, due out Thursday. It’s the CPI report, so not the one watched by the Fed. Should still generate plenty of noise. More on that later.

For today we’re looking for anything that come in to move the broader indexes. There isn’t anything on the economic data release calendar, so maybe the more speculative parts of the market will continue to be where the action is. To wit, AMC and BlackBerry are seeing bids, already up 2% this morning.",The_Contrarian01,12,/r/investing/comments/nu7v9c/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h0w8029/,0.024,0.919,0.057,0.7171

95,MSCI," Should I buy the Russel 3000 for my new employer brokerage account?

Hey guys. I have learned so much here already first I want to thank you for all of your help.

I am a 29 y/o currently paying into a ROTH IRA and an employee pension. I am switching over my employee pension to a 7.5% matched members directed account so that I have more direction of the account. 

My current ROTH IRA is currently:
55% FSKAX 
20% FZILX
15% FBGRX and FSELX 
10% FBALX (Has 30% holding in bonds but is out performing pure bond funds) ill probably switch out FBGRX and FSELX for some REITS soon. Im learning so much every day.

My new brokerage account gives me the option to chose from the following: 
OPERS target date funds (2 star moening star rating)
OPERS Stable value fund (basically just has a 2% interest return on stable investments)
OPERS Stock Index fund (tracks the Russel 3000, 4 star morning star ranking)
OPERS Small cap (russel 2000, 4 stars)
OPERS Large cap (russ 1000 4 stars)
OPERS Non US (3 stars. Tracksnthe MSCI ACWI ex US index, 5.56% return since inception) 

After my account reaches 5000. I can place 50% of my funds into the market freely through Schwabb brokerage. And 50% has to remain in my pension funds (OPERS) none ofnthese funds look all that appealing to me. Is it too reckless if I put 100% of my retirement in the russel 3000 for bow until it hits 5000? And then I can diversify out more? Should I add more foriegn through FZILX in my ROTH IRA to balance it? Can you help me navigate the best decision to make with some not so great options.",Slaxle,1,/r/investing/comments/nu7v9c/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h0ye49u/,0.043,0.849,0.108,0.9513

The idea that the company can benefit from reinvesting in itself a la Amazon. I'd rather extraordinary reinvestment and capital allocation than crappy capital allocation and a high dividend (see T, GE before Culp and many other examples.) Dividends are fine, but I think people have elevated them to a degree that has lead to people often yield chasing and posts on here about ""that dividend looks too good to be true"", as if it's free money which it isn't. Additionally, I'm under the belief that there are some income names where the shareholder base seems overly complacent as long as the dividends keep rolling in every quarter. T's management has been incredibly mediocre for years and made some tremendous mistakes, but I think now that the dividend has been lessened, people finally waking up to that a bit rather than throwing money at it because they're familiar with it and they see the dividend yield.

Dividend growth (minor but growing dividend, strong fundamentals and great capital allocation) is great, but often it seems like people don't want that - if they are looking for dividends, something that has a dividend below 2-3% is of no interest even if it's a fantastic company.",dvdmovie1,2,/r/investing/comments/nu7ukb/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h0w50wd/,0.044,0.754,0.202,0.991

Yet any bets on ""temporary"" shortfalls will only exacerbate the shortfalls, and will decrease the value your stocks will hold in 5, 10, 20, infinity years later. It's like tying a racecar to a tree, you know it will get to the finish line, but you're making it move slower and get there later.

Tesla is a magic example, nobody who opposed tesla wanted to let it go where it went. Many companies end up bankrupt instead. And if we take the sane centrist path, lots of companies shorted will stick around but definitely not benefit. You say a company's fair value is suppressed, but you're joining in suppressing it. It might never stop being suppressed and be uncovered. Again, not every shorted company makes a tesla recovery to all time highs. In fact, well, we only know one, tesla. That's it.
