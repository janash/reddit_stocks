67,GME," TBH I'm only here because of GME. I knew WSB existed and I laughed at them because they were funny, but I wasn't subscribed because WAY too often, was it a completely random bet and I very largely lean towards long term investing. 

I don't thin WSB was supposed to really be taken seriously either. Like when people did actually YOLO on an option trade, then didn't then diversify and play it safe, they'd just yolo on the next stock and try and go even further. Not that everyone did this, but it was the ideal thing to do. The sub encouraged epic gains or losses, as long as it was epic. So while most people would take profits at some rational point, people could say to diamond hand in order to make it epic as well as to encourage someone to hang through a down season. 

At this point, diamond hands are part of the investing noob culture. The way IMO that they ""should"" be used is to signify that you are waiting for stock to recover, but I'm also a long term investor and not a gambler. For a while GME was a small part of my portfolio and something I found interesting until I realized that the company was actually trying to improve and so I increased my position. I'm still not 100% in, but that's also because I'm not a WSB person.

Opened the Hertz $25 calls for $2 and sold the $35 calls for $3 (mostly, occasionally got a $2 for $2 - which was a slight loss on fees, and a rare $1 for $3 or $2 for $4). You have to leg into them as the system rejects it if you try to straight open them, but if there are 10 open buys at $3 on the $35 and a buy sell spread of $1 & $3 on the $25 call you can often offer $2 and get an algorithm to sell it, you just have to kill the offer immediately if it doesn't go through and try again.

If I wanted to buy stock at a regular brokerage there are a lot of hurdles to keep the rif raf out and I am sure they would laugh if you said.

""I would like to buy $5 worth of Google please.""

So, the other brokerages would not work for me in that I don't feel I have real knowledge or enough money to do it seriously.

So yeah...have a boring mutual fund, but that doesn't work if I have $20 & would spend it on something for boredoms sake.

So even if I don't make ANY money, I get that reward jolt from spending in a way I don't just putting money in a savings account.

232,HAS," Vega is a Greek metric tied to IV. If Vega is at 0.005, that means that your contract will lose that much value for each 1% IV drops.  

Let's say you buy put options after a stock goes up 30% in one day, because you think, ""it HAS to go back down!""

Maybe you're right, but if IV is at 200%, and the price levels off a bit before it moves down, IV might go to under 100%  and as a result, you lose a huge chunk per contract before you even know what happened.

234,BE," Great post. Helps everyone understand how IV affects their plays.

What you missed is specifically how to play something like this. You can use this to wait until IV drops to buy calls or puts. It is a great idea, especially since this is WSBs.

BUT, if you are looking to maximize profits this way, I have been opening weekly calendar spreads on SPY/SPX, since IV is historically low and relatively low on a weekly basis. I win in two ways. If we continue to see no action and spy doesn't move, theta decays the short option and I win. If it does move, IV jumps up and if it stays within my BE points, I still make money. 

FYI, you need to be ready to close out for a small loss/win or be ready to adjust by making it a double calendar if it goes against you!",rwc5078,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otk5bi/how_to_use_side_way_trading_days_to_your/h6y7ssw/,0.056,0.716,0.227,0.9824
235,ALL," You can think of it like that and it works most times. 

But easier way to think is that- extrinsic value is the value you have for an OTM option. So 150c option that costs 1$ is ALL extrinsic value if the underlying stock is less than 150$. While if your option is in the money, than chances are anywhere from 0-99% of that value is intrinsic. So an option of 150c worth 1.5$ when the underlying is $151 is probably 1$ intrinsic and .5$ extrinsic.

236,SPCE," Hello, I would like to offer a strategy that helps even everything out so IV doesn't affect your options trade.

Let's say you're still bearish on SPCE and think it will go to $25 by Aug 20.  Instead of buying only a 8/20 $25 put @ .69 (haha *nice*) you should buy a $27 put @ $1.19 *AND THEN* sell a $25 put, this is called a put debit spread (credit spread works too, in reverse, selling the higher strike and buying the lower but you have to put up collateral)

Why is a debit spread better than your naked put?  Well first, your cost.  1.19 - .69 is only $50, you could buy 10 of these for the same price as what you paid before and if SPCE *does* go down to $25, and you have 10 contracts (cost $500), you'll have 150x10 and end up with $1500 profit.  Second reason a debit spread is better is that you are almost *completely immune* to IV changes, the sold put will limit your profit potential but also limit your exposure to IV and so it is much better to use this strategy around earnings or times when IV is really high.

This strategy works better the further away from the actual price you are, so if you are expecting a very large move and can predict the range it will go to, you can really make bank.

If you think SPCE will go to $20 by 8/20, buy a $22 put, sell a $20.  It cost $13 and you could profit $187 if it continues to go down 20.  You could buy 40 of these for $520 and make $7,480 if it goes to $20.

I just want to say, I am not suggesting that SPCE will continue to go down, I haven't researched it at all and I am just looking at the options chain for ideas to trade.",dreamlike_poo,40,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otk5bi/how_to_use_side_way_trading_days_to_your/h6wnqvv/,0.009,0.885,0.106,0.9858
237,SPCE," I think you meant 33p SPCE because the 35p is 3.95$.

The 33p is at 2.13$. As for your question, if you bought it last week that means that your timing was bad. Because from 22 to 27th of July, SPCE bearly moved at all and today when it did move, it moved in the wrong direction. 

Because your put expires this Friday, since you bought the option, you have just been side trading and IV and theta are the only thing eating you. From 5.4 to 3.08 was all theta and IV. Today tho, you lost .95$ per option which was mostly delta of  -.76 and -.19 of theta.

240,GME," the lower the delta -> the higher the risk and the higher the reward

the farther the expiration -> the lower the risk and the lower the reward

the higher the IV -> the higher the risk (more expensive contracts), and reward is basically the same as long as delta is the same

the higher the vega -> the higher the risk (of IV crush), the reward more or less stays the same

delta can also loosely be understood as the probability of the option expiring ITM. so it can give you an estimate of your chances of profit. delta of 0.5 means its ATM, delta below 0.5 means OTM, and delta above 0.5 means ITM. 

wallstreetbets tends to go for OTM calls, so delta below 0.5. higher risk though, but also higher reward. I would personally say an IV above 100% is getting in the high range, but thats just my opinion. IV can go as high as 500% or even higher than that.

250,AMZN," 
The thing about thata on weekend is actually much more complex. It’s the trader equivalent of physicist arguing about quantum mechanics. Some think theta does work on week end, others do not think it does, while another camp thinks the theta decay of weekend doesn’t happen *in weekend* but rather is already priced in on Friday or slowly since Monday. While others believe it has to work because trades can still happen on weekends but the theta is so small it doesn’t matter when comes monday. 

Personally from my experience, I think theta does work in weekends but because 99% of traders cannot trade in weekend, and market while unpredictable has to be mathematically consistent, this weekend theta is priced thoughout the week. So usualy a option left at x price will open at x price on Monday. (This makes most sense because if you buy a AMZN option with 9.0 theta, on Friday, you dont wake up with -2k loss on Monday if it opens at 0%)


>The Argument That Options Lose Value Over The Weekend

>Some traders argue that options must lose value over the weekend. After all, weekend days are still days. And traders can still trade on the weekend. The major stock exchanges are closed, but they can still do over-the-counter trades with each other.

>Some options brokers even offer after-hours trades as an added service. So even though the volume for options trading is lower, this does not mean that it is nonexistent.

>The Argument That Options Don’t Lose Value Over The Weekend

>Other option traders argue that options do not lose value over the weekend. According to this view, traders who are holding onto options on Friday know that they will lose money if they don’t exit their positions. This makes them want to get rid of their options before the market closes.

>As a result, they are willing to get rid of their options at a lower price than they otherwise would be. This causes the weekend time decay to be “priced in” on Friday. Because of this, no time-decay actually occurs on the weekend.

>The Argument That The Value Lost Doesn’t Matter

>Another argument many traders make is that the value lost by options over the weekend doesn’t matter. According to this view, most of the time-decay is priced in on Friday, and the little bit that is left over is so small that it is a waste of time to try to profit from it.

>These traders often rely on empirical research to support their claims. If we look at price changes on options over weekends and exclude ones whose underlying assets had price changes, we find that these options often open on Monday near the same price they were on Friday. And it’s extremely rare for these options to have price changes of greater than 1%.

>Since the empirical evidence does not show any time-decay over weekends, these traders argue that we have to assume it is either nonexistent or too small to matter.

>Conclusion

>Do options lose value over the weekend? Unfortunately, there is no clear answer to this question. Some traders take one position and others argue the opposite point of view.

>But one thing is clear: if there is time-decay over the weekend, it probably doesn’t matter as much as other factors.",OptionLoserSupreme,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otk5bi/how_to_use_side_way_trading_days_to_your/h6w384b/,0.133,0.791,0.076,-0.9904

258,AM," There are dozens of us. Literally dozens!

But really I've explained this to people before. Noone rolls up to a McDonald's at 10:45 AM and then goes ""oh damn they're not serving lunch yet, guess I'll go somewhere else"". But I've gotten to the front of the line at 10:31 before and been told that they're not serving breakfast anymore, at which point I have to explain to the cashier ""look I know you stopped serving breakfast while I was waiting in line, but I know you've still got some leftover biscuits or something back there, tell me what you've got left and I'll order from that"".

Sometimes that works, sometimes they tell me sorry I'm a robot and we're only serving lunch, at which point I do go somewhere else. McDonald's breakfast stuff is actually good, their lunch menu is basically just a last resort if there's nothing else cheap and decent around.

Who the fuck eats lunch at 10:30 AM anyways. At my job we go at promptly 11:30 AM, but that's because we're lazy and don't want to work any longer, not because we're actually really hungry at that point.

My guess? Big$ gonna stay on the sidelines until retail dumps all their money into puts, then big$ gonna make the thing rip and have retail bitching about getting fucked over by HOOD twice.

510,CLF," You need to look at the timing and course of delta in India and the UK. UK is currently experiencing a crash in Covid numbers. India already did. And the US will too. The numbers going up in the US is both expected and priced in (as of the drop last Monday). We might see one more drop, but that is going to be it. The market has nasty systemic risk left over as a result of continued QR, the bond market, and whatever the hell is going on over in China, but the delta variant just isn't part of it. The market isn't crashing if the US puts on masks again. No way it's shutting down again over it... Would take a much nastier variant to do that.

Also, your assumption that steel will just trade along with the market. ie

> standard market correction (between 10-15% market correction)

> The economy stays flat, and things trade sidewise

is wrong. Go look at October 12th to Nov. 2nd of last year as just one example. Spy pulled back 7.35%. CLF went up 10%. Fair chance it would run down with market initially, and then pop up. It just depends on the reason for the drop. On an average day it does tend to move with market, but it happily and regularly detaches.

Finally, the infrastructure bill is just icing on the cake for CLF. It absolutely doesn't need the bill to run. Over the course of 2022 CLF has disconnected from HRC prices. It ran up with those prices in 2020 and hasn't in 2021.

784,CLNE," Long term IDK on this one. Energy and fuel sector winners/losers are likely to depend on which political parties rule and how much climate change becomes obvious to the rubes that don’t recognize it. If “conservative” political parties rule in the US, EU, and China doesn’t capitalize on us not investing in greener technology, fossil fuel companies will do well for a while. In that case though there’s not much incentive to go to natural gas because oil/gasoline/diesel will continue to be so over subsidized. So betting on CLNE isn’t likely to pay out there. 

On the other hand if political parties that take climate change more seriously are able to win control in US, EU, etc and/or China seriously invests in greener technology fossil fuels, well natural gas still isn’t all that green so once again I think CLNE will not be a winner long term, though maybe briefly in the transition. 

Only way I see CLNE really being a winner is if “conservative” political parties move a bit on the global warming issue, at least to a point that they can compromise and move subsidies from oil to natural gas. Given current political divisions, and the constant messaging “conservative” voters are receiving stating global warming is a hoax, I don’t think that compromise is likely.",travelinTxn,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otw3wc/daily_popular_tickers_thread_for_july_29_2021/h6ys8g0/,0.075,0.779,0.146,0.9425

834,TSLA," So I will probably get downvoted but....

You completely ignore the market and competition. The EV market worldwide in 2020 sits at around 3 million cars. It has been growing fast, and the 19>20 change in sales comes to a bit less than 30% growth. (That number also inlcudes plug-ins and hybrids electrics). While the global EV market has been booming, Tesla has not been able to keep up. Its global market share has dropped from 29% to 11%. This means that not only has tesla not been able to keep up with demand, but that competitors are eating away at its dominance. With companies like Ford and Volkswagon saying they are going hard into the EV market, Tesla has some major headwinds. Your estimate of 3 million cars per year by 2024 assumes several things:

1) TSLA can do it (how many years did it take to get its first factory to 900k again?)
2) If TSLA goes back to its 29% market share, 3 million cars would assume a total market of above 9 million. That would be a 300% increase in three years, or a 45% annual compound growth in the market (much higher than what we have been seeing). If TSLA can only keep its 11% market share, the total EV market would need to be like 27 million cars per year, and require over triple digit  growth a year. (to give an estimate of how insane that number is, currently total new car sales worlwide are only about 17 million per year).


Your contention that Tesla comes roaring back DESPITE an environment that is more competitive is a pretty rosy picture, especially that you are basing it only on automotive side assumptions.

There’s a lot of competition now in the EV space that can make cars less expensively than Tesla.

Xpeng and Nio are going to beat Tesla in Asia. They’re also going to harass the hell out of Tesla in Europe. And look out for Volkswagen.

Most people in the US think Tesla‘s are over priced. The Asian EV companies are definitely going to beat them on price. I’d wager that GM and Ford are going to do the same in the US.

847,ICE," Good Discussion,.

But I would point out:

A) We have been hearing about competitors crushing Tesla since 2010.

Right now in North America, Tesla sells 80% of all EVs. And that includes all the compliance cars like the Bolt. If you count road trip capable EVs, Tesla sells over 90%. 

B) Tesla's growth is from ICE sales. Not from other oem electric sales.

C) Other OEMS do not have the battery supply contracts in place. (VW exception)

D) Toyota realized how F'ed they are recently and so have been gaslighting us lately with hydrogen and hybrid non-sense and hard core lobbying.

E) Tesla has laid out their growth path of around 40% vehicles per year recently. They predicted 500K vehicles for 2020 way back in 2014. And everyone laughed at them.

F) You're right, 2023 might be optimistic. But it doesn't really matter if it is 2023 or 2024. My point was medium term in the next few years. I should have made that more clear.

G) The only times Tesla really loses market share is when particular markets have different delivery logistics. (Oh my god Tesla lost market shared in Norway in February"" When the boat actually arrives in March)

H) Tesla is essentially sold out of most models well into Q4 2021.",ElectricPance,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otwk5v/tsla_is_still_undervalued/h6ycf48/,0.057,0.788,0.155,0.9779

852,GME, Undervalued tends to have an indication toward using conventional valuation models suggested by Benjamin Graham. Unfortunately these valuation don’t seem to apply in this market which rests mostly in speculation. Speculation which means predicting the future since you seem to have left your dictionary under your table to keep it from wobbling like a true degenerate. GME was undervalued taking into account its assets vs Liabilities and current revenues.  Valuation models do take into account future revenues based on previous growth. I didn’t bother to read this because $700 a share for TSLA seems justly valued until there is any significant news on chip shortages and sales. $2T seems like a possibility but nothing more than speculation.

GME was undervalued taking into account its assets vs Liabilities and current revenues.  Valuation models do take into account future revenues based on previous growth. I didn’t bother to read this because $700 a share for TSLA seems justly valued until there is any significant news on chip shortages and sales. $2T seems like a possibility but nothing more than speculation. I could see it happening but lets call it what it is shall we. Betting not investing. Its a good bet too. I like TSLA but its not undervalued.,Ashamed_Pea4644,-4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otwk5v/tsla_is_still_undervalued/h6ydca1/,0.061,0.828,0.111,0.6748

855,TSLA," Remember how after the first wave of the pandemic there came a second one that was much worse? Same thing could happen with a market crash... Last time the central banks stepped in with pretty much all they got to keep the market from crashing further. Next time? What's left in their bag of tricks?

Not saying that's what's going to happen - just that it very well could. Everyone and everything is leveraged to the tits and pretty much everything is in bubble territory.

You think FSD by the time it’s ready will be something only Tesla is capable of? I paid $10k for FSD and I’m going to tell you right now they are years and years behind their promises. Well actually, considering FSD was supposed to be good to go at the end of every year since 2016.. ignoring that, they’re still years and years behind what their new promises are. 

Other companies have a lot of time to keep up with Tesla. Especially since others are going to be using Lidar and radars. Teslas shift to vision only will not speed up the process.

Obviously the fear of future action is weighing on the stock, but a lot of unfounded fear (like delisting) is baked into the recent sell off. If the situation doesn't worsen, and the CCP is indicating that the fears are overblown [using the state media](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/china-state-media-moves-reassure-044854654.html) , then it is entirely reasonable to expect that the share price of unaffected companies will quickly recover.

I need to go look at the lock up period, but to be blunt... No PIPE investor is going to sell, even with their discounted shares. It'd be fucking stupid. Cannae is also the main investor by far, and Bill Foley is the one with founder shares. He's not selling, and that's a guaranfucking tee. He's the fucking chairman.

To add to that they're already beating their expected Q2 earnings, as of the last update before they merged with WPF, and the CEO is a visionary guy. 

Only one analyst but he set his price target to 16. 

I know the sun sets at night, and rises in the morning. I know i'll have made money in Feb on my Alight calls.

Red Flag 1:  
""The company aims to take advantage of the growing demand in the vitamin-gummy market with a “global forecast to 2025 the global gummy vitamins market size is estimated to be valued at USD 5.9 billion in 2020 and projected to reach USD 10.6 billion by 2025, recording a CAGR of 12.5%” [https://www.reportlinker.com/](https://www.reportlinker.com/) ""

Red Flag 2: 

Grove, Inc. is in the business of developing, producing, marketing and selling raw materials, white label products and end consumer products containing the industrial hemp plant extract, Cannabidiol (“CBD”).  
  
I find it weird that they don't tell investors how much each type of product contributes to their sales or at least categorizes by say gummy, tincture, oil, rub, etc.

&#x200B;

Red Flag 3:

""expects revenues to range between $10.1 million and $10.4 million in the fourth quarter""

""Revenues for the full year of 2021 are expected to span between $23.6 million and $23.9 million.""

So, they are saying that they expect to make about 40% of their annual revenue in the 4th quarter, but have not mentioned how they make money.

Taking a look at one of their online marketplaces, it looks awfully dead in terms of reviews. Also, the majority of reviews are 5, which give me the feeling that they are paid reviews/reimbursed reviews.

1315,CC," I don't think that's how it would work. Pretty sure if your broker liquidated the shares due to margin call then your CC just effectively becomes a naked call and you'd have to go buy the shares if the call you sold gets exercised.

1320,RH," 1. Switching is easy. RH lost at least $4B in Q1 alone in AUM from people switching. 

2. Other apps can gameify stocks if that's what you're looking for. Who chooses a broker based on this retardedness?

3. Hood set up to lose boatloads of cash to numerous lawsuits now making their way through federal courts. 

4. There's no WSB DD saying RH goes down. That's wishful thinking. We all want it to, that's all. Nobody knows which way it will ultimately trade. Don't know who you think you're arguing/betting against here. 

5. Public sentiment regarding RH could not be any worse. The only thing they can hope to do is cling to the users they have left. No new users looking for a brokerage would ever consider them based on heavy negative sentiment that is not going away. 

6. If they shut off your ability to buy once they will do it again. What good is a trading app that doesn't let you trade? Hood is worthless garbage borderline pyramid scheme with PFOF.",Believer109,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ou2p4z/why_im_going_long_hood/h6ziinp/,0.104,0.819,0.077,-0.6256
