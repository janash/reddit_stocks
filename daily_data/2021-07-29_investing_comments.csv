28,USA," As a Chinese myself it is hard for me recommending anyone to invest in Chinese listed company. The risk and reward ratio does not make much sense anymore. Chinese companies are notorious for cooking their books and misrepresenting their business to pump the stocks. The rivalry between China and USA will go on for another decades. There is too much uncertainty. Chinese Communist party will have an firm control on all aspects of china and will not hesitate to crush any company they deem a threat to the government. The risks are too big right now however big the upside.
The Netflix documentary. Chinese hustle has put it quite beautifully the risks investing in Chinese stocks and the schemes many company perpetrate. The Chinese financial system is too opaque and not subject to the say level of transparency, regulations and legal scrutiny. In China if u act as a journalist independently investigate a big company they can have u arrested. 
I threw the caution in the wind and invested in Alibaba and got beaten quite badly. There are so many investing opportunity out there.

29,VERY," As other people have said here.

It might sound dumb, but people have to account for the cultural (especially how laws work) in different countries. Over here in the U.S companies have more tools against government powers and can defend themselves, also the right to private property / liberty values ect.

China? As mentioned, its an Utilitarian Society controlled politically by one party that produces hyperpartisan politics without opposition. The government dictates what is ""good"" and doesn't really counsel with anybody --- this makes investing in Chinese stocks VERY RISKY , if suddenly the company/industry you're betting on is targeted as ""bad"" by the CCP.

An example: Hong Kong wanted to hold free elections at Hong Kong, what did China do? Pass a law that deemed such elections a ""National Security Threat"" and illegal. Because such elections could mean the CCP losing power.

1.) The CCP releases a list of recommended sectors for foreigners to invest and a list of sectors they do not recommend. Education is on that second list.

2.)If you buy shared of the BABA holding company you do OWN the holding company. The holding companies OWNs a majority of the revenue generating parts of Alibaba. Some of them are international and some of them are directly in China. Some of the parts of Alibaba are in sectors that the PRC does not allow foreign investment into. Only those parts are VIE. VIE means that the holding company does not own them but instead can controll all of their profit. The holding company is also able to excercie an option to exchange the CEO of the VIE.

47,CVS," One way they can is they become a logistics company for small businesses. They can seriously challenge amazon in a way if you think about it.

They are already staring to do that and I use them quite often. Want some quick things like soap/detergent/coffee/sugar/something from a Walgreens/CVS? Why order on Amazon? It takes a day minimum, comes in overly packed cardboard boxes.

Instead I order on Uber, they pick that from the local CVS, comes in a shopping bag like normal and gets delivered in less than an hour. It costs more than amazon for delivery, but is way quicker. I use it when I need something quick. I have used to it to get NyQuil, soup and green tea when I was sick. I used it when I realize I am running out of soap/shampoo etc 

They can become the logistics partner to companies like CVS/Walgreens/7-11/target to deliver to local customers very quickly.

Hydrogen is an alternative to batteries, but way more difficult to scale across applications.  Energy density is okay for transport but you need to bring ICE back into the car.  Useless for small or micro applications.  Batteries are easy to set up for decentralized energy production but consumer hydrogen generation and compression is unlikely to work for both safety and economic reasons.

Lots of new advancement and funding in battery tech, almost no progress in hydrogen because there's not much you can do due to how straightforward it is.  Most hydrogen hype I've seen is buzzwords to draw in laymen.  Unless there's some Nobel prize worthy breakthrough in hiding I doubt hydrogen will be more than niche in the next century.

I would say at a minimum do the following

1. Read the past few years of their filings , listen to the earnings calls. I know its boring but read their quarterly 10Q filings (quarterly) , 8k (only if they have a major event, like purchase) and finally the 10k. While listening to the earnings calls if anything doesn't make sense or you do not understand what they are talking about dig deeper into this. Note this is incredibly boring these reports are dry but they will give you a lot of insight into the business
2. This is really part of 1 but be sure to learn how to do some basic analysis of financial statements like the Balance sheet, P&L, statement of cash flows. Go over the basic financial ratios , now I always tell people not to just focus on one ratio like PE, but going over a whole list of them does give you a better understanding of where the company is . Then look at things like revenue growth year to year, earnings growth, cap ex expenditures , cash flow and free cash flow. Try to understand where the cash flow is coming from. Note if you do not understand the business I would be very leery of investing in it. Not saying you have to know how to design and manufacture semi-conductors before investing in INTL or TSMC but at least know the basics of the business.
3. (maybe this should be before number 1 I am not sure) have a basic understanding of the general industry not specific to the company, also many companies have somewhat non related business products so this can even be harder, but at least have a general understanding of how the business ecosystem works. For example if you are investing in a speculative biotech company you probably should somewhat understand all the testing phases and have a basic understanding of the FDA approval process.  There are some podcasts like oddlots or exchanges where sometimes they have an industry person come on and do a pretty good job of explaining this.
4. This is also a BIG one people overlook, lots of times if you gotten this far you really want to invest in the company and are basically looking for confirmation bias ; look at the risks, look at their competitors; Go out of your way and read people posting the bear case for the company . Also now you almost now need to do steps 1-2 on their biggest competition .

That's memestock crap.

The US is in a quiet retreat from western pacific in its old posturing.

Since the 1990s there's been growing concern of US industrial supply chain including Japan and Germany and the unwinding has been severe from there as well.

Chip manufacturing has been on the list a while but with growing Chinese power, the US has become very serious about divesting entirely.

You may not think it's likely. I'm telling you it's already highly likely and only going to accelerate.

The US has been pouring resources into Africa, into blocking the Kra canal, into disrupting the 1 belt 1 road initiative, into area access and denial in the South China Sea.

142,DD," US won't prematurely pull a plug. That's why Im saying this idea AMD is in a great position and INTC is weak is very poor DD.

That's memestock crap.

The US is in a quiet retreat from western pacific in its old posturing.

Since the 1990s there's been growing concern of US industrial supply chain including Japan and Germany and the unwinding has been severe from there as well.

Chip manufacturing has been on the list a while but with growing Chinese power, the US has become very serious about divesting entirely.

You may not think it's likely. I'm telling you it's already highly likely and only going to accelerate.

The US has been pouring resources into Africa, into blocking the Kra canal, into disrupting the 1 belt 1 road initiative, into area access and denial in the South China Sea.

144,INTC," It has nothing to do with the US foundry location. It has to do with TSMC's compromise by Chinese assets.

China hammers Taiwan with 20-25 targeted spear phishing campaigns per day per institution. We aren't talking weak phishing either like a pdf sent from your bosses' spoofed email. But very sophisticated and targeted.

**YOU** don't have a source for benchmarks gaming by INTC. Simply - INTC has **NO** control over benchmarks. That's done independently by a number of retailers all vying to sell products, they don't care which products

They know gamers and data center architects are cut from the same cloth and would demolish their store if they sold them crap they can verify themselves.

C) Samsung is on the US Compromised list, just FYI. TSMC is just more well known. US wants to inhouse their production and exclude anyone with Chinese infiltration.

145,AMD," Zero. I evaluate the situation based on what appears to be unfolding.

A lot of people are valuing AMD based on projected earnings. Not based on changing strategic environments.

I think that's near sighted and has pumped the price by some amount.

146,AMD," Ugh. What? Lol. Intel is a leader in performance. AMD still has significant architectural security holes that prevents its adoption into certain government applications.

147,AMD," How do you figure? AMD is trying to spin up 2 fabs but that won't be sufficient compared to intels 4+

But the impact won't be devastating to global sales. It just means AMD is overvalued since it's not positioned right for this change (CHIPS ACT)",DarthTrader357,1,/r/investing/comments/oti40u/bear_theory_on_amd_valuation/h6whl28/,0.0,0.904,0.096,0.6871

149,AMD, Intel filled the hole and fast. I don't know who tells you Intel down plays. You can patch it yourself. But elaborate if you want. Intel gets government contracts AMD doesn't. And won't.
