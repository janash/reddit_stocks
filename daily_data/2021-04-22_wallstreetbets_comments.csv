You're selling puts when the stock price is low (put premiums are high) and buying them back when the stock price is high (put premiums are low). He said he uses margin, but you can cover your puts with cash as well. Heck, if GME is 160 and you want to buy, why pay 160? Sell a 140p instead and take the premium, whether or not you end up with the shares at the end of the week.  


I do this as well, just not on such a micro-managed level. I sell weekly puts. Roll them up/down/out on Thursday/Friday. If there's a mid-week surge, I consider repositioning like this as well.

236,PLUS," With MVIS being on the verge on releasing their A-Sample results this month (not too many days left in April) and the recent high short interest on the stock.  What are your ideas on a potential squeeze in the event they release successful PR on the A Sample.

IMO it seems to be a win/win if you‚Äôre willing to hold.

Now with the US shift of forces to Poland and other cold war lines in the last few years and arming of Ukrainian forces there are extra staging points of gear and US personal.  Putin is playing chess with a newly sitting president that he annexed Crimea under as a VP with no retaliation.. so that said.. if he goes for it  which is slim to none...

They are both number 1 in their channel. UWMC has a lower risk profile so when defaults from the shutdown finally happen, Rocket will feel it, UWMC won't. Rocket is also going to drop off big when refinancing dies down as that is a major part of their business. Their cost per acquisition is also much higher as they have to advertise heavily to get their customers. UWMC requires little to no marketing because they use brokers.

I'm bullish as fuck on VIAC short term and cautiously optimistic long term.  If I had the capital to buy 2500 shares I'd probably set up bear call spreads backed up by the underlying stock.

577,AT," Depending on how much capital you have you could sell a put and promise to buy those shares in the future at a later date while they hold that money as a covered money put and you get paid to write the contract and you could buy calls right now. 

For instance, every retard with 100k wants to YOLO into GME and do it wrong. Even me. If I knew then what I know now, I'd take 100k and sell 10 $100 puts on GME for Jan 20 23 and get PAID over 44k in premiums and immediately place calls on the stock if I'm bullish. If I don't know which way the stock is trading, I'd wait until there's a dip and buy as many options (long term focus on premium only) and utilize that leverage to buy and sell those calls every couple weeks (same amount every time to track earnings). If the price goes up and the contract expires, you'll have to unfortunately buy those shares at the price you agreed to and then immediately you can sell them for a profit. If the price tanks, you might get called on you contract and own 1000 shares trading at a price lower than you can sell AT THAT TIME.   You then have to begrudgingly write a covered call at a price (150?) Down the road and they'll pay you a premium again and then you watch your shares go bye bye if it's called.

579,GME," If you're okay with the stock leaving your hands at the price you placed, it isn't a loss. Only FOMO queens worry about gigantic gains and looking at those as losses if you held. Nobody is clairvoyant, but you can write covered calls. Take GME for example. I've averaged down from the $220's per share to 161 per share while adding 200 more shares from writing covered calls at $480. Guess what I get to do until then? Write weekly calls until my price per share gets so low that if my shares get exercised and I sell each contract for $480 it'll be more than a 300% profit than it already is. I also have used my money to purchase calls in the future that even if GME sniffs $480 my calls calls could be sold to pay back the difference. But I'll continue to average down until it was basically a limit sell at $480. It only took me 4 weeks to average down $61 and this is including my dumbass that lost 7k on a call. I'd say I'm doing fine with a realized gain of 20k on 105k within 3 months of investing coupled with a bunch of stupid yolo bets and unwise rookie mistakes.

761,DD," As someone working in Cybersecurity, this Telos Ghost thing sounds like total BS, unfortunately. Another snake oil product that companies may buy into to give them a false sense of security. I do not see any advantage of using it vs a traditional properly implemented and locked down VPN. I even could see how this turns wrong, since if you anonymize everything, how do you trace back in case of a breach? That is, if their anonymisation actually works...

They also say that in their [white paper](https://www.telos.com/wp-content/uploads/private/Telos-Ghost-Remote-Access-white-paper.pdf):

>Consumer and private citizen use of VPNs generally centers on publicly available services that improve the confidentiality for web browsing. This approach also carries significant privacy risk, especially when the public VPN provider chooses (or is forced) to enable high levels of activity logging. This can result in citizens who require privacy having their website usage, timestamps, and even entry locations exposed to authorities or hackers.

This is flawed, enterprises do not use commercial VPN solutions usually, they buy a product and install it in their own network, and the encryption is therefore between the end user and the enterprise network.

The reason most breaches occur is not because companies do not have the ""right security product"", its because they fail at basic things (i.e: implementing 2FA on external portals, Patching their stuff, etc.) Anyway, I'm not saying this stock will not pick up steam for a while, since companies are thirsty for cybersecurity magic solutions thses days, but I am saying maybe do not bet too hard on that Ghost product.

However, I really like their Xacta product. This space truly does not have many offerings for compliance automation (afaik) and it is a big part of cyber, and with more regulations popping up everywhere, it is not going anywhere.

Anyways, just wanted to chime in with some opinion from the cybersec field, I hope this may help in the DD.",frako40,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mw8jtp/telos_tls_dd/gvgzvsd/,0.044,0.873,0.082,0.9095
