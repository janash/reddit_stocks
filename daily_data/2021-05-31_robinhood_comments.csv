0,IT," I have a 2011 Vizio with a bad power board failure.  It was literally a $130 part.  Removing the back panels with a Philip's, and voila be careful as replacing the board.  Put back panel back on, and 

I have a 85"" 3D LED Vizio TV.   

Being technically inclined it wasnt difficult to find online resources, figuring out the troubleshooting and cause.  It was a pain in the ass to find the board, but a repair shop is always somewhere.  

 Self repair I think is a necessity. DIY for LED TVs are easier than the old Tube TVs.  That i can attest to, as a non-specialized tv repair, layman.

5,TV," I’ve had a Vizio TV for as long as I’ve been playing video games (first console was a Wii, so easily a decade plus.) The first one broke because I was playing during a thunderstorm.

The second one has lasted up to now, and the only real issue I’ve had was a dead pixel here and there.

6,TV," I heard, years ago, that Vizio used screens from Sony (maybe Samsung?) that didn't pass inspection by that company. 

Not sure how true that is, but in my experience, Vizio tv's work wonderfully... until they don't. It's a very hit-and-miss experience on the consumer end. I want to like them for the price of the product, but I've got Westinghouse and Emerson TV's (both of which are notably uhh... budget-friendly) I've been using for *years*, and 2 Vizio's (including a 3D TV, because I'm 1 of the 4 people who like that) which have failed.

For some reason, I *want* to have some kind of brand loyalty to Vizio, but ultimately, I just can't recommend them at all, even as a budget screen. They work when they work, but they die quick.",alchemist5,5,/r/RobinHood/comments/np65yt/just_a_quick_glance_at_vizio/h03kv5m/,0.11,0.8,0.09,-0.4427

>  are you expecting some surge in TV purchases as the pandemic ends?


It's a good question. I dont think TV sales will ever see a huge slump. We are a TV culture, there was probably a good pump during COVID but IMO Americans will always be buying TVs. 


I'm also noticing a trend that as TVs (Vizios are a good example) get cheaper, people are buying new ones more often. Used to be you drop a few grand on a TV and have it for a long while. Now (for better or for worst) it's drop $400 on something and replace it in two years.

9,TV, I feel that guy was probably trying to upsell you. Vizio is a very solid mid tier TV. Great bang for the buck. I wasn’t a great sales man tho cause I wasn’t a upseller lol. I was more honest. And yes I’ve owned vizios in the past that have worked perfectly fine and I’ve heard they’ve only gotten better.,Scoobydiesel87,5,/r/RobinHood/comments/np65yt/just_a_quick_glance_at_vizio/h03f3dk/,0.0,0.608,0.392,0.9806
