3,PEG," Be careful with GARP. It is a good idea, and can result in some great buys, but generally GARP strategies are soft on fundamentals. Doing it properly requires an in-depth financial reports analysis of each firm to determine growth sustainability. Many GARP-y firms are growth firms whose growth cycle is ending, or firms with short term free-cash-flow shocks that do not justify the sustainability of their PEG ratios

The management structure warrants additional investigation, as the senior manager covers many funds, and there has been a senior-management change.

The underlying indexing strategy is uninspired and vulnerable to value traps. The low adherence required to the underlying index poses ethical conflict to primary managers of the fund dependent upon compensation agreements. This is compounded by the ability of Geode to allocate per their statistical sampling techniques.

8,ANY," Ok, that's a lot of words, largely pasted from Fidelity's site.  But let's look at the possible risks you identify.  One is ""low adherence required to the underlying index""; but the tracking error for FIVA is almost the same as the tracking error of FTEC, Fidelity's single largest ETF that simply tracks the info tech sector.  While their documents have a lot of disclaimers, I'm not seeing any evidence of a problem there.

You call it Euro-centric but it's less than 60% Europe.  It's only a few percent higher than VEA, which just tracks all developed markets as a passive total index.

Your other criticism, about being vulnerable to ""value traps"" could be said for ANY ""value"" factor ETF unless you provide specific criticism of the methodology (which you didn't...).   I'm glad you looked up the details, though.",pmchem,16,/r/investing/comments/nprdln/10_more_interesting_and_useful_etfs_with_less/h07ei4i/,0.186,0.77,0.044,-0.973

Also, your comment aligns with why I think it's VERY important to look at methodology and ""what's inside"" any given ETF -- hence why I discussed its index metrics and linked its index page / methodology in another comment.

11,ADV," You are correct this is not a full due-diligence report, and I think you misunderstand what I was trying to do. The purpose of this is to give a high level summary of some key features of the fund, and to determine whether it is investable from a portfolio management perspective. Based on the ADV/spreads it is not realistically investable for me, so much of the remainder of the information listed is moot for my purposes. For that reason I touch on a couple high notes so that if I were to ever come back to this fund I would have some context to start from. My full documentation is about 12 pages, but I figured I would toss some summary info up here for anyone who was interested. 

The info I gathered was from Morningstar reports and (primarily) their EDGAR filings, which I reviewed all of. I did not look at the Fidelity website. I also did not copy + paste anything besides the manager/advisor names

I called it euro-centric because it has 134% of the euro allocation of the market index. It isn't a positive or negative, just something to be aware of. Tracking error and prospectus limitations are different issues as one is forward looking and one is backwards looking. When doing portfolio allocation of investor funds being aware of the degree of third-party discretion is important, and since it is not investable for me at this point I did not evaluate historical tracking error. There is no ""problem"" per se at present, but the structure of the fund and loose tracking requirements indicates that before investing client money additional research would need to be done as to how management is compensated, that is all. 

There are several strategies to avoiding value traps in passive investments, the most common are ""quality adjusting"", or G-scoring, or F-Scoring, among many others. [Here](http://www.independance-et-expansion.com/files/upload/fondements-theoriques/Novy-Marx%20-%20Value%20Investing%202013.pdf) and [Here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2672906?seq=1) are a couple articles on the topic. You will note that the size dimension plays a role in the effects of quality-adjustment, which is why I addressed the portfolio size tilt in my opinion.",iguessjustdont,9,/r/investing/comments/nprdln/10_more_interesting_and_useful_etfs_with_less/h07kdcb/,0.061,0.889,0.05,-0.6173
12,GME," ""Schemes to make money"" classic shill/troll move comparing retail to Hedge funds. You do realize HF's have fleeced TRILLIONS over the years? Since when has retail done anything ever remotely close? All retail is doing is buying stock, we don't have Algos that trade for us or teams of experts day trading with options. I think your missing the point, only now does the SEC choose to ""educate"" the retail investor because they can't have another GME/AMC situation. Has the SEC ever actually held HF's responsible for the company's they bankrupted through shorting and other means? How many legitimate companies went under because of this disgusting tactic?

13,GME," Just because you say something is a fact doesnt make it one. If you want facts, the first one you should realize is that the majority of money made from the meme stock pumps was by other institutions and funds, if the SEC was somehow colluding with ""Wall Street"" (which isn't as homogenous and united as you are implying), why would they step in when they made the most money from what happened? Your evidence is circular and doesn't make any sense, and saying people aren't capable of collusion is ridiculous and a flat out lie. Not to mention anyone can get access to the information ""Wallstreet"" uses, it just takes more time than most investors here who want to just pump money into GME are willing to spend to actually research something.  Just because you disagree with something doesn't change facts and definitions.

The easiest way to tell someone has no idea what they are talking about is when they refer to Wallstreet and Institutions as some united front, when in fact their are countless firms and individuals with competing ideas and investments. Maybe the SEC's goals align with some of those large players, but acting like the SEC is out to get retail investors and thinking your fighting against ""Wallstreet"" by making them money is a conspiracy theory at best.",MAUSECOP,5,/r/investing/comments/npje95/sec_hosts_discussion_for_retail_traders_might_be/h06ptig/,0.068,0.86,0.072,0.2163
14,GME," Investing isn't a zero-sum game, just because institutions make money doesnt mean retail investors can't as well.

. Beach Body is definitely an MLM company (no matter what other elements of their business exist) and that may always be an issue for serious investors to get around.

. They simply are not Peloton. They are one of many companies following in peloton’s wake.  Many companies will be fighting for the at home fitness market in the us and abroad, so the pie will be fractured heavily.

. I’m bearish on the overseas expansion, because their MLM strategy that made them successful is based on US cultural factors.  Who the f*!k can say whether they’ll be able to translate that in other markets.

. Investing in SPACs before merger is a speculative gamble.  Any company that has not issued a public earnings report cannot be given benefit of the doubt.  

. If BODY does as well as you think it will, then it will be a great buy at $30 next year and you can ride it to $100 or $300 or whatever.   If it fails to do what you think then it will plummet or chop for years.  There’s no reason for you to FOMO yourself into a gamble instead of watching for a good future investment.

25,MLM," I disagree with people worried about MLM - the MLM component is direct to consumer, not consumer to consumer, and it is for their supplements only.  They dont have housewives spending their husbands military field pay to buy supplements to sell their friends, they sell directly to consumers.

They own some fantastic workout properties (P90x, Insanity, Hammer and Chisel, The Work, MBF) and have contracts with top trainers who are still producing content (Autumn Calabrese, Shawn T, Meghan Davies, Amoila Cesar).  They have top of the line supplements compared to.competitors which is a differentiator.  They will compete directly with Peloton by adding bikes, and they currently manufacture equipment and proprietary add ons for their workouts, so they have experience here and the existing supply chain/logistics to pull it off.

65,FANG," I think squarespace's primary customer base is small businesses (or even sole proprietors) looking to make something quick online. I wonder how big this sort of market really is though - they also have huge competition from places like https://shop.app/ which seems to be specifically geared towards small businesses looking to make an online/mobile presence. 

As for things like personal blogs, i highly doubt someone would pay the premium price of squarespace, when you can just host it on github for free. 

Overall, i think definitely bumpy business ahead, and it's risky to invest in - but without the huge upside like the big FANG companies (i really don't see squarespace being in the same league as the FANGs).",Chii,15,/r/investing/comments/npk9s3/what_does_everyone_think_above_the_squarespace/h05k800/,0.037,0.838,0.125,0.8706

94,NAV," They don't state an effective duration on the website or fact sheet. The market price seems to trade at a huge spread away from NAV (last closed at 48.89 vs 47.33 NAV, and no IIV is posted that I can see) so looking at the price doesn't give a great idea. They even had to restate NAV on may 12 by 2.55% for some reason... I can't find an NAV chart yet. I don't know how to estimate the duration from the holdings.  

So basically the most crude method is comparing the unreliable market price for a handful of days to similar funds like TYO and TMV. Based on that, it seems to maybe be somewhere between TYO (-23.73 yrs) and TMV (-56.61 yrs), so something like -40yrs, and it would move about 10% if yields on 20+ year tbonds rose 25bps. That would not necessarily happen if the Fed raises FFR by 25bps, though I think at this point, the market does not expect such a raise (only 7% chance by december according to FFR futures), so I would expect that if such a move did happen, it would also have a similar effect on long bond yields. It also doesn't take convexity into account but I expect that to be a smaller error compared to the other two.   

I would wait a couple weeks to see if the price starts tracking NAV more closely or for an NAV chart to get a better estimate. Mine has a pretty large margin of error.",kiwimancy,2,/r/investing/comments/nppldq/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h07mgqz/,0.059,0.883,0.058,-0.0825

AMD has been doing very well with its ryzen chipsets and graphics card lineups, taking full advantage of the difficulties that nvidia customers are having.

Completely anemic growth probably worst in sector I'd have to compare a few more.

105,AMD," > As chip production begins to pick back up, Intel’s stock should begin to go up as well.    

Chip production never significantly dropped, so there is no recovery.   

The ""chip shortage"" is more accurately: A chip shortage in *certain sectors* who cancelled their chip orders/slots, which were happily picked up by others expecting a surge (like consumer electronics). Some of these sectors, like cars, who were expecting decreased consumer demand instead witnesses unusually high demand, and they were unable to regain their slots. 

Also building a chip plant takes at bare minimum five years and that is assuming the wait list for chip manufacturing equipment isn't already years (which, spoilers: it is). Intel's biggest asset is that they're a US company, and there's national security interest in on-shoring. So I expect the USG to bail them out by funding a major US chip production facility within the USA for mostly USG/DoD consumption. In the meantime AMD/TSM will continue to eat Intel's lunch, and their market share (which is a lagging indicator) will continue to shrink.   

While I'm bullish on Intel over tens of years for the reason above, I'm bearish right now as I don't believe we've hit the bottom. P/E may actually get worse if earnings sink as Intel tries to compete with AMD's superior products in the enterprise/data-center space (i.e. deep discounts).

131,AP," >so it’s not likely to just fall in value if the market doesn’t?

Correct and if you want to get the details look up what an Authorized Participant does. They are usually a big bank and they can do something special; The for example could buy up a bunch of shares of the ETF (usually takes several million) then they could actually redeem those ETF shares for the actual underlying stock

Or they can do the opposite they could buy all 505 stocks that make up the ETF in the correct weight and then Trade them in for ETF shares this is how the ETF stays in line with the underlying assets or very close.

So lets say there is a weird case where the S&P500 is flat or even slightly up, however for an specific ETF (VOO) everyone is selling for some weird reason . With good old supply and demand this would push the price of VOO down, however at some point VOO will trade at a discount. At this point one of those AP can step in and they will start buying shares of VOO, because if they get it at a slight discount they can redeem the shares for the actual underlying stock and make a quick almost risk free profit doing the arbitrage

However because there are a bunch of competing APs doing this the discount or premium on very popular ETFs stays very small like 0.05%",SirGlass,2,/r/investing/comments/nppkph/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h07hxpg/,0.026,0.843,0.131,0.9745
132,TK," It’s all about shopping around to find the best deal. Sometimes a 6 month contract can be 1/2 the cost of a 8 month contract at the same strike price. If you expect the underlying revenue to hit the strike price less then 6 months in, the extra 2 months may not provide a better return after factoring in the change in premium. Nat gas Stocks that don’t pay dividends and are under 1 billion market cap are a good place to look. BTE, TK and BIR all fit the bill. I might suggest combining this strategy with covered call writing of TOU, a divided paying low vol gas play.

135,AG," They have a better business model in my opinion. Payments upfront and receiving cash flows from that versus leasing and operating planes as an airline.

The cash flows are more reliable, debt for the construction costs decrease with inflation, they have a geographical moat, how wide it reaches can depend on market position and competition though.

Last year they were very cheap and while they made a lot of losses, the industry is growing by ~3.5% over the next 2-3 decades and some of them are quite profitable.

I personally got into Fraport AG because they have a strong position in the market (imo), have the local government as stakeholders which would have saved them in case corona got too bad and they were cheap in my valuation for them. Right now they are not cheap anymore but there might still be opportunities put there.",ValueInvestor0815,4,/r/investing/comments/npoxro/any_reason_why_not_to_consider_jets/h06ec3w/,0.04,0.867,0.093,0.7147

138,TV," (*knocks on wood*)

I bought a non-smart Vizio 1080p television almost 11 years ago now. There are two dead pixels, but otherwise it's trucking strong.

Every other one I've seen since looks (and is) cheaper, in a material sense. Sure, they've got the market cornered now, but I will ride out this non-smart TV and then *maybe* buy another from them, but I don't expect a quality product anymore, and certainly not in my price range.

I'll just get a Roku stick and plug it into whatever TV I want. Having the wifi and such built into the television itself is another point for failure and it's too many variables.

I disagree with the entire business model at this point",smr5000,2,/r/investing/comments/nq25ot/is_there_any_good_reason_why_no_one_is_buying_vzio/h08fy60/,0.103,0.804,0.093,-0.296

142,CWH," This is hard to answer tbh. It largely depends on the stage of the company. In general,company managements with high ownership % have the best interests of shareholders and usually perform better. However, huge corporations not run by founder owners rarely have mgts with a high percentage of stocks and if they do you have to question how much the CEO is being compensated.

I use this metric more for when I'm looking at small caps vs. relatively new public companies. For example, CWH (>50%) and RKT(> 90%) both have great mgt ownership. Berkshire is typically what comes to mind for huge corporations with great mgt ownership, but of course Buffet built it from the ground up.",homeless_alchemist,4,/r/investing/comments/npuxd4/what_is_an_example_of_good_share_ownership_by/h072dp4/,0.01,0.871,0.119,0.882

144,IMO," >In theory it is better for DCA (let's say more precise) and for returns. If an investments pays out annually versus weekly, it can have a small impact on total returns because you can invest the payouts earlier. Realistically the impact is very small though.

That's assuming they're paying out dividends as they come in, as opposed to holding onto cash to make their payouts more even and consistent. Realistically the way most of these funds achieve consistent regular payouts is holding onto enough cash that they can make dividend smoother.

IMO the higher expense ratio you pay for ETFs that pay monthly/weekly is almost never worth it.",skilliard7,3,/r/investing/comments/npw0fg/do_weekly_distribution_etfs_are_better_for/h07x3ty/,0.038,0.936,0.026,0.1809
