0,CLNE," My advice is set a goal on how much you willing to loose before you sell whatever stock you choose to buy. There’s always that point where you need to dump and run with a loss or a gain. So get to know the highs and lows of the companies you like. You can’t rely on quarterly reports now a days. So find something that just started growing with a reasonable price. Clean energy , the company CLNE, is growing and its inexpensive. Take a look .",phil7111,2,/r/RobinHood/comments/n3c5ze/help_this_newbie_invest_1000/gwpkrfh/,0.098,0.749,0.153,0.6249

7,BE," Everyone has their own strategy and yours is fine. Here's how I look at it. 

With bull puts I don't think much about the stock going higher. I look for ones that I don't think will go lower. So imo Ebay is a good pick. 

Also, because I'm not looking for it to go up, I sell weeklies. Less time for it to go bad, faster time decay.

Then I focus on the break-even point I want. I look at the second lowest resistance level and see if I can find a risk/profit balance around that. With Ebay first resistance is around 55.30, second is about 54.88.

When it comes to picking strikes, I like both to be out-of-the-money with a few strikes between them. The larger spread gives you a lower profit %, but it makes the profit/loss slope longer, giving you more time to decide when to bail if it starts going bad. 

So for Ebay, I would be inclined to pick something like May 7th 55.50/51.50. With the chart I'm looking at that would be max gain 0.53, max loss 3.47. Break even at 54.97. But the profit of 15.27% is a bit low for me so I probably wouldn't do it. 

If I base it off your expected break-even of 55.10, then I would probably pick May 7 55.5/54. BE @ 55.12, 33.93% profit, max profit 0.35, max loss 1.12, probability of profit 60%. Then I'd sell 14 pairs for a credit of 490.

Again this is my current personal way of picking bull credit spreads. It's quite conservative and short-term. In this case Ebay doesn't quite fit my criteria, but it's close and maybe going out two more weeks would make it look better, but I thought it would be helpful to walk through my thought process. Hopefully it will give you some ideas on how to pick your spreads with more confidence. 

Final thoughts - see what the sentiment is Monday and if it looks like it hit resistance. Also take a look at more expensive tickers so you don't have to sell as many to get a decent return amount.",wkbaran,3,/r/RobinHood/comments/n3b99t/need_feedback_on_put_credit_spread/gwp7424/,0.074,0.77,0.156,0.9879

9,RH," They credited $10,000 in margin cash and debited $10,000 in collateralized securities.  RH has the right to seize $10,000 of your securities in a margin call if your investments lose value.  RH will never lose money due to your margin borrowing, but you can lose everything you borrowed plus an equal amount of your own collateralized securities.
