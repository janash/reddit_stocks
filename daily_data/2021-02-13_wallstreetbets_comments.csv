35,BE," You're all retarded. He sold enough of his calls the he got 13 million in the bank. At 20% cap gains, he walks with: 10.4M.

Here's the rub. If you put $2M into a high index retirement fund, you get $60k/yr in interest back. At 5x, you'd get $300k back a year. The tax bracket for most states for someone making $300k/yr in income is 32%. This means DPV for the rest of his life will earn $204k/yr in post tax income. You then remove another 15% from that for healthcare. And you're left with $174k/yr.


Long story short DPV played the long game but sold enough along the way to lock in his gains. As a result, he's got enough cash to make $174k per year after taxes and best in class healthcare for him and his family.

Here's another rub. For ~10k/mo in cash spending, $4k in bills & discriminatory (food, activities, entertainment) and $6k/mo in mortgage, at 174k in cash means that his annual expenditure can cap out at $120k/yr and he'd still have $54k to do whatever he wanted: vacations, more market plays, or simply putting it all away for his daughter's college fund. (Last I recall he's got one).

$6k/mo means that he can afford a loan of $1.25M against some house meaning he can afford a $1.5 million dollar house after ***all taxes and bills and life is accounted for.***

Tl;dr of the GME/DPV saga: lock in modest gains when the price stabilises. The thing that likely may get in trouble with the law is his weekly post updates. When you've already locked in $13M in gains, another potential 13-15 million more is playing with ideas. There's no tangible benefit to an average person getting an extra 10 million after achieving their first 10. This poisoned the expectations of people who held GME, they saw the big number and thought they could be too. It was FOMO on a scale unheard of, and people HODL'd. Then the price cratered.

And people held, down to 380, then 320, then 275, then 225, then 175, then 125, all the way down to ~55. Plenty of opportunities to sell, but people held and then he went and posted one final update during this decline and said he's taking a step back. But that time, he had likely lawyered up and said lawyers had likely told him to fucking stop because he was influencing the market. He unofficially became pointman in an unintended movement.

One final thing. Being told to lock in modest gains periodically isn't financial advice. It's life advice. Greek mythology taught us this valuable lesson.

94,DD," You see the same things over and over again as you age. You start to recognize the media as a contest of outrage, and then you notice that unrest magically occurs every time there is an election or and majorly when there is a presidential election.

You build assets as you age too. Suddenly you remember you friend Karl, and think to yourself, I bust my ass at work, I invest my money, and do my DD, why should I pay this guy to carry on drinking and drugging, partying his wages away? Man, Fuck Karl.

It's simply a difference in perspective. It's popular for young people to think of themselves as victims of capitalism. They blast the opinions out ironically from iPhones, wearing Levi denim, drinking Starbucks lattes, after watching Netflix and Hulu streamed on the Verizon cell provider. They don't see how their lives and the lives of others are improved by it, and they can understand what poverty actually was, having grown up in a land where they do not face starvation. Complain about Ramen all you want, it's a lot better than starvation.

When you are older, you have the benefit of time. As much as the young don't like to admit that they don't have it figured out (You're not supposed to at 20, that's a good sign), they just wish things were better at that time. Scapegoating 'the rich', (Most millionaires are retirees that spend 40 years in the market @ 7% compound interest maxing their contributions end up as millionaires.) who are largely comprised of their aging, now millionaire parents, and a few hundred billionaires, is a lot easier than saying: I'm young, I don't have any assets yet, it will take me time to build them.

I'm not saying that baby boomers didn't have an easier time of it, but you have to understand why housing was so much cheaper in the first place from the 1910s to the 1980s. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed in WWI, WWII, the Korean War, Vietnam and many more were pulled in the Armed forces and resettled in base housing on the government dime. Many of those were selected at random by a draft. https://www.va.gov/opa/publications/factsheets/fs_americas_wars.pdf  

You got to count your blessings, and understand your market. DD. Houses get real cheap when there is no demand for them, because you know, the men and women who would otherwise own these houses are killed in battle or militarized. It's harder now, but to get started, you save like 10K.

Point is, you realize the American dream is a lot more attainable when you have taken your money, invested it into your home, or invested it into your IRA and Roth. You can't see that when you are eating Ramen noodles.",autumn_melancholy,31,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/linjhq/dear_cnbc/gn55fkd/,0.086,0.835,0.079,-0.8924

104,GME," That's not even true at all, we have seen rating on FOX, CNN, ABC, CNBC , ect. Plummet the last few years and nothing changes. It is very obvious who pays the bills. 

I'm by no means a conspiracy theorist, but this was done in the middle of the day and as blatant as it could be to anyone paying attention. 

If they cared about rating they would care about the majority of their viewers and how those would view them moving forward. Like come on the whole SLV and weedstocks the next day dropping after being WSB Idols despite GME, AMC, BB and maybe NOK being pushed here for the entire week before. 

I didn't lose money so I could care less, but to pretend that there was not as blatant propaganda and misinformation (and continues to be) is completely fucking assinine.


The rest of the entire situation is up for debate, I honestly believe even with the relationship to citron Robinhood is in the clear and the worst thing they really did was not admitting it was a liquidity issue when it very obviously was. The blame goes on those who changed the covering rates for brokers knowing full well what would happen. 

How that is proven who the fuck knows, the SEC has shown that they are incompetent of maintaining a free market, Wether from malevolence or incompetence it does not matter. They fail to serve the public in not only a nation matter but globally.

259,XOM," Gas price increases due to artificial supply constraints while unemployment is still significantly elevated. 

Low prices at the pump have been kind of a secondary stimulus for everyone, but XOM and others cannot afford to lose $10B/quarter indefinitely. 

Gas prices going up without demand organically increasing will also push food inflation up higher. Food is already running at like 4% inflation, and gas prices are going almost vertical since Saudi Arabia unilaterally cut production to keep supply at current levels.

If food and energy start ramping beyond control, what we will have are 15M people without jobs, no way to afford to get to one, and who are going hungry. Historically, that's when actual civil unrest begins and can lead to a currency collapse. The only hope is continuing to push out fiscal stimulus programs and hope that unemployment reverses course and we can essentially pay the working and middle classes with US dollar paper to not stop and call bullshit on the entire system.",Hacking_the_Gibson,15,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liv06w/heres_to_all_the_karens_in_the_world_gme_20k_to/gn7npq1/,0.11,0.772,0.118,0.1546

&#x200B;

But it completely ignores the ones still monitoring short positions and trading volume for the possibility of a second squeeze.

&#x200B;

There's definitely a large portion who understand opportunity cost, and who would feel that it's YOU who are missing an opportunity. And they'd probably join you in laughing about people who sold after the correction. Those people missed an opportunity, bought high, then missed the opportunity for another squeeze by panic selling before they took the time to determine if there is still opportunity for shareholders. FOMO became huge losses and turned into FOLB (Fear of Losing Bigger). They've had 2 weeks - perhaps will have even longer - to evaluate their positions at a fairly consistent price range between $50 and $60. But their newfound fear caused many to simply tuck their tail and run. If you were able to sell at $200+, great trade, more power to you. But if you held or bought at $200+ then sold for $48 and won't look at GME again... it's possible to miss 2 opportunities in a single buy/sell.",Trick_Bett,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lit39w/autist_rich_asian_ape_bought_10m_of_gme_near_its/gn9j0yl/,0.103,0.742,0.155,0.9101

361,PLTR," While I agree that not every stock is capable of a true short squeeze, terminology is always a problem. Eventually shorts have to cover unless they want to bleed interest. And it‚Äôs important to realize that this is a market dynamic that currently will not go away in the US.

IF YOU DONT HAVE CONVICTION AND ENOUGH OTHER PEOPLE WHO LIKE THE STOCK, THE SHORTS WIN!

So with that said, I disagree with the perception presented in your post. Since learning about short selling and more of how the market works thanks to this shitshow, I‚Äôve learned a few things and I‚Äôm not going to pretend shorts don‚Äôt exist now.

Some things I‚Äôve learned, the shorts have been greedy and overbearing! They‚Äôve been shorting stocks for no reason other than they want money. Not based on fundamentals not based on anything other than their crooked self interest. THIS IS A TREND THATS HAPPENING NOW! And it‚Äôs evident in a LOT of stocks and even explains some of why this happened in the first place. Citron has always been full of shit. There‚Äôs no reason for them shorting PLTR other than they want to scare retail.

That shill Jim Cramer even has a video explaining what shorting really is, a scare tactic.

Simply put if you don‚Äôt realize what‚Äôs been going on with shorts and don‚Äôt talk about it then you‚Äôre doing yourself and everyone a disservice. And I‚Äôm willing to let the overuse of the term short squeeze slide.

379,DD," Yeah. Here is the key takeaway: you don't matter sweet fuck all to the market.

Full stop, nothing YOU do will change the price of the stock. 

So, at best, what you want to invest based on what you know (e.g. What you work in, what you like). 

That said, there are absolutely opportunities to ride the waves the hedge funds make, for short squeezes and other things. By the time it hits the front page here, the ship has already sailed. 

And you jump on due to FOMO (fear of missing out), and get left holding the bag. 

So slim new posts, read DD, ask questions. 

And use tools, such as:
For shares available for the public to borrow (and importantly the fee!) :
Iborrowdesk.com 

For an idea of where the options are pointing the price:
http://maximum-pain.com

For real, paid information not available to the public:
Ortex

Using those tools, you can get an idea of where things are headed. Ortex is particularly useful, as it gives an estimated number of shares sold short daily. 

So, for example, RKT:

Max pain value for next week is $22 a share, vs the current $20.77

The borrow fee is currently 20% (pretty high), and is trending higher. This means shares are getting harder to borrow. 

Per Ortex, over the past six months, the number of shares sold short has gone from 8m to 36m, and the price hasn't moved. 
RKT Short Trend https://imgur.com/gallery/56TgyE2

There are only 115m shares outstanding, and the float is large enough for the shorts to cover. 

So, what does this mean? The share price would be higher right now without the shorts, and it will eventually catch up. 

Will it go to the MOON? No, and it doesn't need to. 

Stop trying to win the Powerball. 

Disclosure, I own some Jan 2022 $20c, because I expect the price will spike at some point over the year as the shorts leave their positions.

403,GME," It's because one of the early GME posts explained it by comparing us to ü¶çs, the hedge funds to üêçs, and GME as the üçås the üêçs shorted.

On the flip side there are plenty of stocks I don‚Äôt like at their current prices, let‚Äôs just take coke as an example.  At 50 a share you know it‚Äôs not moving anywhere. It hasn‚Äôt for 20 years.

Absolutely wouldn't put all in on them, but its worth having at least a small chunk.

There are absolutely better options in the weed market, but for such a low price there's some good potential.

Don't break yourself on it, but don't let the opportunity slip you by while its cheap either.

516,TLRY," For sure. The stock could always keep going down and now you're really in a hole. But here's one more example to paint how buying the dip really can help:

Let's say you bought a share of TLRY at the peak this week at $73. Then TLRY dropped like a stone to $32. If you then bought 41 more shares, the stock only has to rise <$1 in price for you to sell and break even.

556,GME," How    about actually using volume profile and technical analysis to find    areas of support and resistance and then using short puts to begin to    scale into a position?

I keep seeing people just run in there with a market order and then sell 20 seconds later when it dips down for a split second.

Stop    using stop losses as well, the big firms have access to what is  called   ""depth of book"" which allows them to see all the orders on the  book so   they can stop run and shake the idiots out.

Also    if you get a good entry near support, you can practice proper risk    management and not have to worry about so much about the stock going    down in the near term.

 

plus if you keep track of your put  profits, you will quickly find that you are playing with house money  when you get assigned, or your initial capital at risk has been heavily  reduced.

I think I am rocking  about $13.00 in credit from selling the 40 puts in GME at this point, so  my real risk has been reduced massively.

Also  as you scale into your position, you can either take the credits and  increase your position or keep your position the same and use that  credit elsewhere.

or you can even  buyback your puts for 1.00 profit and be like ok I just made $100.00,  GME is trading at $50.00 I can buy 1 share by way of limit order, then  keep shorting the same put while keeping $50.00 in profit.

There  are so many better ways to play this situation, it is absolutely mind  blowing how people just run in there and market order shares.

If people were more patient, then we could easily force an infinity squeeze in 3 to 5 years.

574,EV," There can't be that many generations of hardware left before the traditional desktop is basically obsolete. As things like fiber & 5g become more accessible, it seems like centralized computing will inevitably see a resurgence. Once those technologies are mature, you can get the latency down to where the user wouldn't really know the difference.

I see it a bit like the EV vs. ICE car debate. The ICE converts fuel to mechanical energy, and we're all driving around with our own little engines producing the power we need right now. The EV has a battery that's likely charged by some gigantic engine at the power plant. Rather than going directly from fuel to motion, the EV puts a few more steps into the mix - electricity generation, transmission, battery charging, then finally conversion to mechanical energy.

On the face of it, people used to think that an EV ended up being less efficient because of all those extra steps. Right now that's how people see centralized computing. The truth now is that EV's are just more efficient. All those losses are so low & the power plants are so much more efficient than any ICE that it is still more efficient to go the electric route in basically every scenario in a developed nation. All those improvements to the infrastructure took time, but now we're here.

The same thing will be true of centralized computing. Once the data infrastructure makes it not matter what the physical location of the computing hardware is, we will see massive gains in computer performance by switching back to the centralized model.

At that point, custom retail hardware will be essentially pointless. It would be significantly more expensive & still perform worse.

606,USA," >PSA: for those who didn‚Äôt know, you have to pay taxes on your profits. If you don‚Äôt hold the stock for more than 12 months (capital gains law) then you will pay taxes at your prevailing tax bracket come tax time. Otherwise you only pay 15% on profits.


To add some nitpicks: you pay 15% PLUS your state long term capital gains tax.

**Thus, the California Collorary**: If you took short term (<1y) profits and also have a job and reside in CA, may god have mercy on your soul. For someone who's an engineer at a FAANG company (yes, I know, all those poor, highly-paid, free-food-eating FAANG engineers), they'll end up paying insane taxes. This is what all the reddit kids who love socialism and sometimes communism fail to understand. Yes, Norway is fucking great to live and the health and other benefits are insanely better than the USA. But you pay a 35%+ income tax rate, a 25%(!) sales tax rate,  a 22% social security rate (how else would norway pay for the incredible level of health care they can provide the entire populace?), a social security company premium rate over 10%, and a social security employee premium just under 10%.

You can do the math to figure out how much tax you'd be making if you were a fucking Shark in the markets just making insane money on memestonks, but lived in Norway and the gov took more than half your energy before a dollar hit your bank account.. You can either have socialism (extremely high taxes in all areas of life to ensure the entire populace has good health care and retirement benefits) OR you can have capitalism, where the government at least takes you out to dinner before they fuck you on their gains.

**This brings us to California, the worst of all worlds.**. A highly-paid CA engineer will pay 32-35% federal PLUS 10-12% in state short-term gains tax. **That's a total of a 47%+ tax payment out of your gains**. That is fucking **robbery**. 

Now for comparison let's take someone with a ~$40k/yr job, a respectable salary in any state, provided you live by your means. You're STILL still paying 28-30% of your short-term market gains in taxes. That's right kids, you're getting MUGGED if you live in CA. That's that Norway Tax Special, but with none of the socialism benefits.

this is the problem for me it's not that I don't think pltr is a great product that will do well, I just think that's already priced in. I think 5 years of doing well is worth them being about 60b at most. if they were currently at 20b right now I would say they are a great deal that can get bigger. but 150 m in contracts per year is just not enough cash to justify 60 billion market cap.

761,GME," I agree. I have a feeling that any shorts that were covered since the run up were by MMs, not by hedge funds. MMs have the ability to nakedly short a stock to ‚Äúprovide liquidity.‚Äù I am unsure of to what extent they can do this, but I am sure that there is a limit in relation to % of organic float. I feel as though that limit was reached the day buying was halted. 

If they had in fact been nakedly shorting for the sake of liquidity (high probability since at minimum 200% of the original float is in circulation) then I would imagine MMs covered themselves to the best of their ability during that time.

Yup. :( I'm an on-and-off investor, with an occasional win, and GME was the best trade I've ever made. I got in at $78 that Monday, then saw it at $300 on Wednesday morning, and just had to sell because my cynicism detector was going off the charts.

I'm originally from Russia, so I'm a lot more cynical than your typical westerner. I didn't know who would fuck things up for WSB, or how, but I'd strongly suspected it'd happen very fucking soon. I'm not gonna lie: I was tempted - so tempted - to hold forever ($1,000 etc) or sell only half, etc. But in the end I looked at how much my stonk went up by, decided to listen to my cynicism, and sold for a 276% gain. ($78 to $293)

In another world, where nothing shady happened, where GME went to $4,269.69 - I think I still would've been content with my decision to sell. I needed the money, I made it, and I cashed out with the full understanding that I might be wrong - but hey, cash is cash. It's like in a casino: all those chips in front of you are just pieces of plastic. You don't truly win until you get up, walk away, and cash out.

The game is rigged (always has been), those fuckers manipulate the rules whenever they want, and there's no real way (short of a BLM riot) for us to get back at them because the SEC is just as corrupt. The best we can do is find ways to operate within this system, not betting our rent money, and constantly aware that we're dealing with shameless criminals. (And adjust our decisions accordingly.)

I'll probably get a ton of downvotes for this post. I don't really care - it's all just imaginary internet points.

926,ABC," All credit goes to u/MichKOG from r/investing.

‚ÄúCommon misconceptions about markets

First of all, I want to start by saying that some hedge funds are shady fucks. There are a lot of things they did that were shady. Here are a few examples:

[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp)

Now I want to address some of the misconceptions that new traders have about the markets.

1. **I was not allowed to buy shares on RH, did they wanted to drive the price down!?**

DTCC, the clearinghouse for WeBull, RH and other brokerages, recently raised the collateral requirements for GameStop transactions to nearly 100%.

When RH takes a buy order it goes to it's clearinghouse to exchange it's clients money for shares. The shares are immediately and conveniently transferred to the client, but the funds aren‚Äôt transferred for 2 days. There's this gap between the broker and the clearinghouse for these unsettled trades that the clearinghouse will require some cash upfront (margin) for but otherwise accepts exposure for the rest.

If the stock being bought is extremely volatile, expensive and has a huge amount of recent volume and therefore unsettled trades, the clearinghouse will eventually realize they are floating quite a lot more to the broker than they are comfortable with on the back of a very risky equity. GME fits all these characteristics. It's this point in the GME scenario where DTCC sets margin requirements to 100%. They tell their brokers, ""Hey if you want to get GME stock from us, we will not accept your word that this trade will settle in two days. Instead we need the money upfront since we are already way too exposed to this one ticker from you.""

Now, if RH wants to continue filling buy orders for it's clients it needs to come up with ALL the money for each trade. RH does not have nearly enough cash on hand to handle this, hence the recent draw down from of RH's credit lines as they try to get enough liquidity to keep buying shares for their clients. Eventually the brokers just don't have enough cash, throw in the towel and stop accepting buy orders until they can settle more trades or the clearinghouses release the margin requirements for these stocks.

The concept that RH would fuck over basically their entire user base on purpose to help a minority investor's minority investment in a hedge fund that already closed their fucking short position doesn't stand up to even the smallest amount of scrutiny. It's just a boring case of the market plumping going wild because it's not built to handle pumps of this scale.

**2. But I was allowed to sell!**

Of course you were. Selling is exiting an already created position. The liability that RH would get if you were not able to sell and the price went down would be insane. They can not stop you from selling an asset that you own. They can, however, block the purchasing of new assets through their platform.

Updated Information:

The DTC only requires collateral on the buying side of the trade. That is the side at risk because the buyer might have bought on margin or with funds that haven't fully settled in their brokerage account (like RH's instant deposit). There is no guarantee that the buyer actually has all the money to complete the trade until it clears 2 days later.
On the sell side, however, you're sending stock to the DTC which doesn't have the same sort of questionable backing. They can accept that stock with a high level of confidence and debit the broker's clearing firm whatever the stock was to have sold for. So selling is pretty easy for a broker because they can debit you and get a reliable debit from DTC which clears the immediate credit risk for the broker.
DTC is the one left holding the bag if the buyer fails to come through. [I'm not 100% sure about the next part, but I think it's right.] DTC will then keep the collateral payment as well as sell the orphaned stock at market price to recoup part of the loss and write off the rest (or they might make a profit if the stock rose in value during the clearing process). This is where another risk to DTC comes in - if the buyer defaults and the orphaned stock drops steeply in value during the settlement period (as $GME is very likely to do), then they have to rely on the collateral for most of their coverage. That's why they raised collateral for $GME.
Back to the original point, Robinhood didn't shut down selling because of liability risk - but because they simply didn't need to do that. DTC was only making buys difficult to complete.


**3. But Fidelity and ThinkorSwim allowed people to buy and sell.**

Thinkorswim and Fidelity own their own clearing houses and have enough shares to satisfy the orders. Also, they do not need to pay collateral since they are a clearing house.

**4. Okay, but what about the 120% short interest, Melvin will be closing their position soon, and a short squeeze will happen.**

Melvin claims that they closed some of their positions. There was enough volume for them to do so. 

The short interest are just estimations. Short interest information gets released on 15th and 30th of each month. Next week we will be able to see the short positions.

Hedge funds keep taking short positions and are much better prepared for now, because there is more money to be made on riding a stock down to 40 from 400, then from 5 to 1.

The whole assumption for a short squeeze incoming is built around the assumption that there is still short interest of over 100%, however, there is not confirmed data, as it comes out on 2/9.

Many hedge funds are also riding the wave up, and have long positions in GME. Blackrock, one of the biggest money managers already made insane profit, and will probably ride this on a way down.

**5. But a short squeeze will happen!**

It could, or it could not. The interest in not high to a point were they will go bankrupt or have to buy back the shares to cover. They can comfortably hold for 6-12 month as long as they don‚Äôt get margin called, which I don‚Äôt expect them too, tbh. The payoff makes sense, think about it this way. The interest is I think 30% yearly. Let‚Äôs say you short a billion dollars worth GME. You pay annual interest of 30-40%. Hedge funds definitely have enough money to pay that 300 million a year. Now, let‚Äôs say in a year a price goes down from 400 to 40. A fund will make essentially 900 million dollars minus the interest fee and etc. it is a no brainer for some bigger funds to take this position and enjoy their easy 40% profit.

Considering many funds have insane amounts of collateral, they will not get margin called from this.

**6. But if options expire in the money they have to sell their shares!**

A lot of options expired ITM on Friday, so why did the price not go up?

Well, how many retail investors that were holding their options actually had enough money to buy 100 shares at a strike price? Not too many.

Additional information:

Assigned/exercised options move stock between people/institutions. However, this movement does not affect the current stock price. (UNLESS someone sold uncovered calls).
The volume of calls or puts being assigned does not matter.
Example: stock ABC closes at $11 on expiration. Investor A owns a $10 call, and it is exercised. The seller of the call (investor B)  already owns the shares (or owns another call at different strike). The following transaction occurs: Investor A gives B $1000, Investor B gives A 100 shares of stock ABC.
IIRC, no volume is reported for ABC, neither a buy nor a sell occurred, and ACB price does not change.
IF they were uncovered calls (not really allowed, its significantly more risk than naked shorts), then Investor B would need to by 100 shares of ABC at current price, prior to the call being exercised.

**7. Okay, but Hedge funds are still bad and evil!**

Sure, I agree. Some are. Some hedge funds get their funding from managing pensions and endowments funds.

**8. But Citadel was manipulating the markets!**

Citadel and Citadel securities are two separate LLCs. They are only allowed to open long positions, they can not short a stock. One is a market maker that processes option orders and has no say in the markets. In fact, the more volume there is, the more money they make on the spreads. Would jot be surprised if Citadel made a lot of money on market making in the past week.

**9. But Hedge funds are insane investors with 50% annual return.**

Not necessarily true, an average hedge fund has been underperforming for the past 20 years. You probably had better returns then them just by investing in index funds. Don't get me wrong, a lot of smart people work in the funds, but their main goal is to hedge, in other words, be safe from market movements in any direction.

**TL;DR**

Hedge funds are bad, but they are not retarded (except for Melvin, who overextends on a short at $5)

But many of the rules that came in play were written decades ago, they were not taken from thin air. Battling against hedge funds is okay, but throwing different theories that will be easily disapproved once they file 13F will not take them down. Knowing how markets work, and being vigilant is how you make more money than hedge funds.‚Äù",Lardass_Goober,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/line54/i_cant_believe_i_have_to_say_this_but_a_lot_of/gn4pyz4/,0.068,0.81,0.122,0.9983

‚ÄúCommon misconceptions about markets

First of all, I want to start by saying that some hedge funds are shady fucks. There are a lot of things they did that were shady. Here are a few examples:

[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp)

Now I want to address some of the misconceptions that new traders have about the markets.

1. **I was not allowed to buy shares on RH, did they wanted to drive the price down!?**

DTCC, the clearinghouse for WeBull, RH and other brokerages, recently raised the collateral requirements for GameStop transactions to nearly 100%.

When RH takes a buy order it goes to it's clearinghouse to exchange it's clients money for shares. The shares are immediately and conveniently transferred to the client, but the funds aren‚Äôt transferred for 2 days. There's this gap between the broker and the clearinghouse for these unsettled trades that the clearinghouse will require some cash upfront (margin) for but otherwise accepts exposure for the rest.

If the stock being bought is extremely volatile, expensive and has a huge amount of recent volume and therefore unsettled trades, the clearinghouse will eventually realize they are floating quite a lot more to the broker than they are comfortable with on the back of a very risky equity. GME fits all these characteristics. It's this point in the GME scenario where DTCC sets margin requirements to 100%. They tell their brokers, ""Hey if you want to get GME stock from us, we will not accept your word that this trade will settle in two days. Instead we need the money upfront since we are already way too exposed to this one ticker from you.""

Now, if RH wants to continue filling buy orders for it's clients it needs to come up with ALL the money for each trade. RH does not have nearly enough cash on hand to handle this, hence the recent draw down from of RH's credit lines as they try to get enough liquidity to keep buying shares for their clients. Eventually the brokers just don't have enough cash, throw in the towel and stop accepting buy orders until they can settle more trades or the clearinghouses release the margin requirements for these stocks.

The concept that RH would fuck over basically their entire user base on purpose to help a minority investor's minority investment in a hedge fund that already closed their fucking short position doesn't stand up to even the smallest amount of scrutiny. It's just a boring case of the market plumping going wild because it's not built to handle pumps of this scale.

**2. But I was allowed to sell!**

Of course you were. Selling is exiting an already created position. The liability that RH would get if you were not able to sell and the price went down would be insane. They can not stop you from selling an asset that you own. They can, however, block the purchasing of new assets through their platform.

Updated Information:

The DTC only requires collateral on the buying side of the trade. That is the side at risk because the buyer might have bought on margin or with funds that haven't fully settled in their brokerage account (like RH's instant deposit). There is no guarantee that the buyer actually has all the money to complete the trade until it clears 2 days later.
On the sell side, however, you're sending stock to the DTC which doesn't have the same sort of questionable backing. They can accept that stock with a high level of confidence and debit the broker's clearing firm whatever the stock was to have sold for. So selling is pretty easy for a broker because they can debit you and get a reliable debit from DTC which clears the immediate credit risk for the broker.
DTC is the one left holding the bag if the buyer fails to come through. [I'm not 100% sure about the next part, but I think it's right.] DTC will then keep the collateral payment as well as sell the orphaned stock at market price to recoup part of the loss and write off the rest (or they might make a profit if the stock rose in value during the clearing process). This is where another risk to DTC comes in - if the buyer defaults and the orphaned stock drops steeply in value during the settlement period (as $GME is very likely to do), then they have to rely on the collateral for most of their coverage. That's why they raised collateral for $GME.
Back to the original point, Robinhood didn't shut down selling because of liability risk - but because they simply didn't need to do that. DTC was only making buys difficult to complete.


**3. But Fidelity and ThinkorSwim allowed people to buy and sell.**

Thinkorswim and Fidelity own their own clearing houses and have enough shares to satisfy the orders. Also, they do not need to pay collateral since they are a clearing house.

**4. Okay, but what about the 120% short interest, Melvin will be closing their position soon, and a short squeeze will happen.**

Melvin claims that they closed some of their positions. There was enough volume for them to do so. 

The short interest are just estimations. Short interest information gets released on 15th and 30th of each month. Next week we will be able to see the short positions.

Hedge funds keep taking short positions and are much better prepared for now, because there is more money to be made on riding a stock down to 40 from 400, then from 5 to 1.

The whole assumption for a short squeeze incoming is built around the assumption that there is still short interest of over 100%, however, there is not confirmed data, as it comes out on 2/9.

Many hedge funds are also riding the wave up, and have long positions in GME. Blackrock, one of the biggest money managers already made insane profit, and will probably ride this on a way down.

**5. But a short squeeze will happen!**

It could, or it could not. The interest in not high to a point were they will go bankrupt or have to buy back the shares to cover. They can comfortably hold for 6-12 month as long as they don‚Äôt get margin called, which I don‚Äôt expect them too, tbh. The payoff makes sense, think about it this way. The interest is I think 30% yearly. Let‚Äôs say you short a billion dollars worth GME. You pay annual interest of 30-40%. Hedge funds definitely have enough money to pay that 300 million a year. Now, let‚Äôs say in a year a price goes down from 400 to 40. A fund will make essentially 900 million dollars minus the interest fee and etc. it is a no brainer for some bigger funds to take this position and enjoy their easy 40% profit.

The shares are immediately and conveniently transferred to the client, but the funds aren‚Äôt transferred for 2 days. There's this gap between the broker and the clearinghouse for these unsettled trades that the clearinghouse will require some cash upfront (margin) for but otherwise accepts exposure for the rest.

If the stock being bought is extremely volatile, expensive and has a huge amount of recent volume and therefore unsettled trades, the clearinghouse will eventually realize they are floating quite a lot more to the broker than they are comfortable with on the back of a very risky equity. GME fits all these characteristics. It's this point in the GME scenario where DTCC sets margin requirements to 100%. They tell their brokers, ""Hey if you want to get GME stock from us, we will not accept your word that this trade will settle in two days. Instead we need the money upfront since we are already way too exposed to this one ticker from you.""

Now, if RH wants to continue filling buy orders for it's clients it needs to come up with ALL the money for each trade. RH does not have nearly enough cash on hand to handle this, hence the recent draw down from of RH's credit lines as they try to get enough liquidity to keep buying shares for their clients. Eventually the brokers just don't have enough cash, throw in the towel and stop accepting buy orders until they can settle more trades or the clearinghouses release the margin requirements for these stocks.

The concept that RH would fuck over basically their entire user base on purpose to help a minority investor's minority investment in a hedge fund that already closed their fucking short position doesn't stand up to even the smallest amount of scrutiny. It's just a boring case of the market plumping going wild because it's not built to handle pumps of this scale.

**2. But I was allowed to sell!**

Of course you were. Selling is exiting an already created position. The liability that RH would get if you were not able to sell and the price went down would be insane. They can not stop you from selling an asset that you own. They can, however, block the purchasing of new assets through their platform.

Updated Information:

The DTC only requires collateral on the buying side of the trade. That is the side at risk because the buyer might have bought on margin or with funds that haven't fully settled in their brokerage account (like RH's instant deposit). There is no guarantee that the buyer actually has all the money to complete the trade until it clears 2 days later.
On the sell side, however, you're sending stock to the DTC which doesn't have the same sort of questionable backing. They can accept that stock with a high level of confidence and debit the broker's clearing firm whatever the stock was to have sold for. So selling is pretty easy for a broker because they can debit you and get a reliable debit from DTC which clears the immediate credit risk for the broker.
DTC is the one left holding the bag if the buyer fails to come through. [I'm not 100% sure about the next part, but I think it's right.] DTC will then keep the collateral payment as well as sell the orphaned stock at market price to recoup part of the loss and write off the rest (or they might make a profit if the stock rose in value during the clearing process). This is where another risk to DTC comes in - if the buyer defaults and the orphaned stock drops steeply in value during the settlement period (as $GME is very likely to do), then they have to rely on the collateral for most of their coverage. That's why they raised collateral for $GME.
Back to the original point, Robinhood didn't shut down selling because of liability risk - but because they simply didn't need to do that. DTC was only making buys difficult to complete.


**3. But Fidelity and ThinkorSwim allowed people to buy and sell.**

Thinkorswim and Fidelity own their own clearing houses and have enough shares to satisfy the orders. Also, they do not need to pay collateral since they are a clearing house.

**4. Okay, but what about the 120% short interest, Melvin will be closing their position soon, and a short squeeze will happen.**

Melvin claims that they closed some of their positions. There was enough volume for them to do so. 

The short interest are just estimations. Short interest information gets released on 15th and 30th of each month. Next week we will be able to see the short positions.

Hedge funds keep taking short positions and are much better prepared for now, because there is more money to be made on riding a stock down to 40 from 400, then from 5 to 1.

The whole assumption for a short squeeze incoming is built around the assumption that there is still short interest of over 100%, however, there is not confirmed data, as it comes out on 2/9.

Many hedge funds are also riding the wave up, and have long positions in GME. Blackrock, one of the biggest money managers already made insane profit, and will probably ride this on a way down.

**5. But a short squeeze will happen!**

It could, or it could not. The interest in not high to a point were they will go bankrupt or have to buy back the shares to cover. They can comfortably hold for 6-12 month as long as they don‚Äôt get margin called, which I don‚Äôt expect them too, tbh. The payoff makes sense, think about it this way. The interest is I think 30% yearly. Let‚Äôs say you short a billion dollars worth GME. You pay annual interest of 30-40%. Hedge funds definitely have enough money to pay that 300 million a year. Now, let‚Äôs say in a year a price goes down from 400 to 40. A fund will make essentially 900 million dollars minus the interest fee and etc. it is a no brainer for some bigger funds to take this position and enjoy their easy 40% profit.

Considering many funds have insane amounts of collateral, they will not get margin called from this.

**6. But if options expire in the money they have to sell their shares!**

A lot of options expired ITM on Friday, so why did the price not go up?

Well, how many retail investors that were holding their options actually had enough money to buy 100 shares at a strike price? Not too many.

Additional information:

Assigned/exercised options move stock between people/institutions. However, this movement does not affect the current stock price. (UNLESS someone sold uncovered calls).
The volume of calls or puts being assigned does not matter.
Example: stock ABC closes at $11 on expiration. Investor A owns a $10 call, and it is exercised. The seller of the call (investor B)  already owns the shares (or owns another call at different strike). The following transaction occurs: Investor A gives B $1000, Investor B gives A 100 shares of stock ABC.
IIRC, no volume is reported for ABC, neither a buy nor a sell occurred, and ACB price does not change.
IF they were uncovered calls (not really allowed, its significantly more risk than naked shorts), then Investor B would need to by 100 shares of ABC at current price, prior to the call being exercised.

**7. Okay, but Hedge funds are still bad and evil!**

Sure, I agree. Some are. Some hedge funds get their funding from managing pensions and endowments funds.

**8. But Citadel was manipulating the markets!**

Citadel and Citadel securities are two separate LLCs. They are only allowed to open long positions, they can not short a stock. One is a market maker that processes option orders and has no say in the markets. In fact, the more volume there is, the more money they make on the spreads. Would jot be surprised if Citadel made a lot of money on market making in the past week.

**9. But Hedge funds are insane investors with 50% annual return.**

Not necessarily true, an average hedge fund has been underperforming for the past 20 years. You probably had better returns then them just by investing in index funds. Don't get me wrong, a lot of smart people work in the funds, but their main goal is to hedge, in other words, be safe from market movements in any direction.

**TL;DR**

Hedge funds are bad, but they are not retarded (except for Melvin, who overextends on a short at $5)

But many of the rules that came in play were written decades ago, they were not taken from thin air. Battling against hedge funds is okay, but throwing different theories that will be easily disapproved once they file 13F will not take them down. Knowing how markets work, and being vigilant is how you make more money than hedge funds.‚Äù",Lardass_Goober,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/line54/i_cant_believe_i_have_to_say_this_but_a_lot_of/gn4pyz4/,0.068,0.81,0.122,0.9983

So this is a bit of a false narrative perpetuated by the new traders. Every broker halt will be ""can't buy, but can sell.""

It happens quite frequently, as they are *legally required by the SEC* to limit their own risk and take steps to avoid insolvency. And there is nothing illegal about it. It would only be illegal if they conspired with a market maker to manipulate a stock, but I cannot be more clear here: the only proof of that is a bunch of redditors saying it.

‚ÄúCommon misconceptions about markets

First of all, I want to start by saying that some hedge funds are shady fucks. There are a lot of things they did that were shady. Here are a few examples:

[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp)

Now I want to address some of the misconceptions that new traders have about the markets.

1. **I was not allowed to buy shares on RH, did they wanted to drive the price down!?**

DTCC, the clearinghouse for WeBull, RH and other brokerages, recently raised the collateral requirements for GameStop transactions to nearly 100%.

When RH takes a buy order it goes to it's clearinghouse to exchange it's clients money for shares. The shares are immediately and conveniently transferred to the client, but the funds aren‚Äôt transferred for 2 days. There's this gap between the broker and the clearinghouse for these unsettled trades that the clearinghouse will require some cash upfront (margin) for but otherwise accepts exposure for the rest.

If the stock being bought is extremely volatile, expensive and has a huge amount of recent volume and therefore unsettled trades, the clearinghouse will eventually realize they are floating quite a lot more to the broker than they are comfortable with on the back of a very risky equity. GME fits all these characteristics. It's this point in the GME scenario where DTCC sets margin requirements to 100%. They tell their brokers, ""Hey if you want to get GME stock from us, we will not accept your word that this trade will settle in two days. Instead we need the money upfront since we are already way too exposed to this one ticker from you.""

Now, if RH wants to continue filling buy orders for it's clients it needs to come up with ALL the money for each trade. RH does not have nearly enough cash on hand to handle this, hence the recent draw down from of RH's credit lines as they try to get enough liquidity to keep buying shares for their clients. Eventually the brokers just don't have enough cash, throw in the towel and stop accepting buy orders until they can settle more trades or the clearinghouses release the margin requirements for these stocks.

The concept that RH would fuck over basically their entire user base on purpose to help a minority investor's minority investment in a hedge fund that already closed their fucking short position doesn't stand up to even the smallest amount of scrutiny. It's just a boring case of the market plumping going wild because it's not built to handle pumps of this scale.

**2. But I was allowed to sell!**

Of course you were. Selling is exiting an already created position. The liability that RH would get if you were not able to sell and the price went down would be insane. They can not stop you from selling an asset that you own. They can, however, block the purchasing of new assets through their platform.

Updated Information:

The DTC only requires collateral on the buying side of the trade. That is the side at risk because the buyer might have bought on margin or with funds that haven't fully settled in their brokerage account (like RH's instant deposit). There is no guarantee that the buyer actually has all the money to complete the trade until it clears 2 days later.
On the sell side, however, you're sending stock to the DTC which doesn't have the same sort of questionable backing. They can accept that stock with a high level of confidence and debit the broker's clearing firm whatever the stock was to have sold for. So selling is pretty easy for a broker because they can debit you and get a reliable debit from DTC which clears the immediate credit risk for the broker.
DTC is the one left holding the bag if the buyer fails to come through. [I'm not 100% sure about the next part, but I think it's right.] DTC will then keep the collateral payment as well as sell the orphaned stock at market price to recoup part of the loss and write off the rest (or they might make a profit if the stock rose in value during the clearing process). This is where another risk to DTC comes in - if the buyer defaults and the orphaned stock drops steeply in value during the settlement period (as $GME is very likely to do), then they have to rely on the collateral for most of their coverage. That's why they raised collateral for $GME.
Back to the original point, Robinhood didn't shut down selling because of liability risk - but because they simply didn't need to do that. DTC was only making buys difficult to complete.


**3. But Fidelity and ThinkorSwim allowed people to buy and sell.**

Thinkorswim and Fidelity own their own clearing houses and have enough shares to satisfy the orders. Also, they do not need to pay collateral since they are a clearing house.

**4. Okay, but what about the 120% short interest, Melvin will be closing their position soon, and a short squeeze will happen.**

Melvin claims that they closed some of their positions. There was enough volume for them to do so. 

The short interest are just estimations. Short interest information gets released on 15th and 30th of each month. Next week we will be able to see the short positions.

Hedge funds keep taking short positions and are much better prepared for now, because there is more money to be made on riding a stock down to 40 from 400, then from 5 to 1.

The whole assumption for a short squeeze incoming is built around the assumption that there is still short interest of over 100%, however, there is not confirmed data, as it comes out on 2/9.

Many hedge funds are also riding the wave up, and have long positions in GME. Blackrock, one of the biggest money managers already made insane profit, and will probably ride this on a way down.

**5. But a short squeeze will happen!**

It could, or it could not. The interest in not high to a point were they will go bankrupt or have to buy back the shares to cover. They can comfortably hold for 6-12 month as long as they don‚Äôt get margin called, which I don‚Äôt expect them too, tbh. The payoff makes sense, think about it this way. The interest is I think 30% yearly. Let‚Äôs say you short a billion dollars worth GME. You pay annual interest of 30-40%. Hedge funds definitely have enough money to pay that 300 million a year. Now, let‚Äôs say in a year a price goes down from 400 to 40. A fund will make essentially 900 million dollars minus the interest fee and etc. it is a no brainer for some bigger funds to take this position and enjoy their easy 40% profit.

Considering many funds have insane amounts of collateral, they will not get margin called from this.

**6. But if options expire in the money they have to sell their shares!**

A lot of options expired ITM on Friday, so why did the price not go up?

Well, how many retail investors that were holding their options actually had enough money to buy 100 shares at a strike price? Not too many.

Additional information:

Assigned/exercised options move stock between people/institutions. However, this movement does not affect the current stock price. (UNLESS someone sold uncovered calls).
The volume of calls or puts being assigned does not matter.
Example: stock ABC closes at $11 on expiration. Investor A owns a $10 call, and it is exercised. The seller of the call (investor B)  already owns the shares (or owns another call at different strike). The following transaction occurs: Investor A gives B $1000, Investor B gives A 100 shares of stock ABC.
IIRC, no volume is reported for ABC, neither a buy nor a sell occurred, and ACB price does not change.
IF they were uncovered calls (not really allowed, its significantly more risk than naked shorts), then Investor B would need to by 100 shares of ABC at current price, prior to the call being exercised.

**7. Okay, but Hedge funds are still bad and evil!**

Sure, I agree. Some are. Some hedge funds get their funding from managing pensions and endowments funds.

**8. But Citadel was manipulating the markets!**

Citadel and Citadel securities are two separate LLCs. They are only allowed to open long positions, they can not short a stock. One is a market maker that processes option orders and has no say in the markets. In fact, the more volume there is, the more money they make on the spreads. Would jot be surprised if Citadel made a lot of money on market making in the past week.

**9. But Hedge funds are insane investors with 50% annual return.**

Not necessarily true, an average hedge fund has been underperforming for the past 20 years. You probably had better returns then them just by investing in index funds. Don't get me wrong, a lot of smart people work in the funds, but their main goal is to hedge, in other words, be safe from market movements in any direction.

**TL;DR**

Hedge funds are bad, but they are not retarded (except for Melvin, who overextends on a short at $5)

But many of the rules that came in play were written decades ago, they were not taken from thin air. Battling against hedge funds is okay, but throwing different theories that will be easily disapproved once they file 13F will not take them down. Knowing how markets work, and being vigilant is how you make more money than hedge funds.‚Äù",Lardass_Goober,15,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/line54/i_cant_believe_i_have_to_say_this_but_a_lot_of/gn4ococ/,0.068,0.81,0.122,0.9984

‚ÄúCommon misconceptions about markets

First of all, I want to start by saying that some hedge funds are shady fucks. There are a lot of things they did that were shady. Here are a few examples:

[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp)

Now I want to address some of the misconceptions that new traders have about the markets.

1. **I was not allowed to buy shares on RH, did they wanted to drive the price down!?**

DTCC, the clearinghouse for WeBull, RH and other brokerages, recently raised the collateral requirements for GameStop transactions to nearly 100%.

When RH takes a buy order it goes to it's clearinghouse to exchange it's clients money for shares. The shares are immediately and conveniently transferred to the client, but the funds aren‚Äôt transferred for 2 days. There's this gap between the broker and the clearinghouse for these unsettled trades that the clearinghouse will require some cash upfront (margin) for but otherwise accepts exposure for the rest.

If the stock being bought is extremely volatile, expensive and has a huge amount of recent volume and therefore unsettled trades, the clearinghouse will eventually realize they are floating quite a lot more to the broker than they are comfortable with on the back of a very risky equity. GME fits all these characteristics. It's this point in the GME scenario where DTCC sets margin requirements to 100%. They tell their brokers, ""Hey if you want to get GME stock from us, we will not accept your word that this trade will settle in two days. Instead we need the money upfront since we are already way too exposed to this one ticker from you.""

Now, if RH wants to continue filling buy orders for it's clients it needs to come up with ALL the money for each trade. RH does not have nearly enough cash on hand to handle this, hence the recent draw down from of RH's credit lines as they try to get enough liquidity to keep buying shares for their clients. Eventually the brokers just don't have enough cash, throw in the towel and stop accepting buy orders until they can settle more trades or the clearinghouses release the margin requirements for these stocks.

The concept that RH would fuck over basically their entire user base on purpose to help a minority investor's minority investment in a hedge fund that already closed their fucking short position doesn't stand up to even the smallest amount of scrutiny. It's just a boring case of the market plumping going wild because it's not built to handle pumps of this scale.

**2. But I was allowed to sell!**

Of course you were. Selling is exiting an already created position. The liability that RH would get if you were not able to sell and the price went down would be insane. They can not stop you from selling an asset that you own. They can, however, block the purchasing of new assets through their platform.

Updated Information:

The DTC only requires collateral on the buying side of the trade. That is the side at risk because the buyer might have bought on margin or with funds that haven't fully settled in their brokerage account (like RH's instant deposit). There is no guarantee that the buyer actually has all the money to complete the trade until it clears 2 days later.
On the sell side, however, you're sending stock to the DTC which doesn't have the same sort of questionable backing. They can accept that stock with a high level of confidence and debit the broker's clearing firm whatever the stock was to have sold for. So selling is pretty easy for a broker because they can debit you and get a reliable debit from DTC which clears the immediate credit risk for the broker.
DTC is the one left holding the bag if the buyer fails to come through. [I'm not 100% sure about the next part, but I think it's right.] DTC will then keep the collateral payment as well as sell the orphaned stock at market price to recoup part of the loss and write off the rest (or they might make a profit if the stock rose in value during the clearing process). This is where another risk to DTC comes in - if the buyer defaults and the orphaned stock drops steeply in value during the settlement period (as $GME is very likely to do), then they have to rely on the collateral for most of their coverage. That's why they raised collateral for $GME.
Back to the original point, Robinhood didn't shut down selling because of liability risk - but because they simply didn't need to do that. DTC was only making buys difficult to complete.


**3. But Fidelity and ThinkorSwim allowed people to buy and sell.**

Thinkorswim and Fidelity own their own clearing houses and have enough shares to satisfy the orders. Also, they do not need to pay collateral since they are a clearing house.

**4. Okay, but what about the 120% short interest, Melvin will be closing their position soon, and a short squeeze will happen.**

Melvin claims that they closed some of their positions. There was enough volume for them to do so. 

The short interest are just estimations. Short interest information gets released on 15th and 30th of each month. Next week we will be able to see the short positions.

Hedge funds keep taking short positions and are much better prepared for now, because there is more money to be made on riding a stock down to 40 from 400, then from 5 to 1.

The whole assumption for a short squeeze incoming is built around the assumption that there is still short interest of over 100%, however, there is not confirmed data, as it comes out on 2/9.

Many hedge funds are also riding the wave up, and have long positions in GME. Blackrock, one of the biggest money managers already made insane profit, and will probably ride this on a way down.

**5. But a short squeeze will happen!**

It could, or it could not. The interest in not high to a point were they will go bankrupt or have to buy back the shares to cover. They can comfortably hold for 6-12 month as long as they don‚Äôt get margin called, which I don‚Äôt expect them too, tbh. The payoff makes sense, think about it this way. The interest is I think 30% yearly. Let‚Äôs say you short a billion dollars worth GME. You pay annual interest of 30-40%. Hedge funds definitely have enough money to pay that 300 million a year. Now, let‚Äôs say in a year a price goes down from 400 to 40. A fund will make essentially 900 million dollars minus the interest fee and etc. it is a no brainer for some bigger funds to take this position and enjoy their easy 40% profit.

Considering many funds have insane amounts of collateral, they will not get margin called from this.

**6. But if options expire in the money they have to sell their shares!**

A lot of options expired ITM on Friday, so why did the price not go up?

Well, how many retail investors that were holding their options actually had enough money to buy 100 shares at a strike price? Not too many.

Additional information:

Assigned/exercised options move stock between people/institutions. However, this movement does not affect the current stock price. (UNLESS someone sold uncovered calls).
The volume of calls or puts being assigned does not matter.
Example: stock ABC closes at $11 on expiration. Investor A owns a $10 call, and it is exercised. The seller of the call (investor B)  already owns the shares (or owns another call at different strike). The following transaction occurs: Investor A gives B $1000, Investor B gives A 100 shares of stock ABC.
IIRC, no volume is reported for ABC, neither a buy nor a sell occurred, and ACB price does not change.
IF they were uncovered calls (not really allowed, its significantly more risk than naked shorts), then Investor B would need to by 100 shares of ABC at current price, prior to the call being exercised.

**7. Okay, but Hedge funds are still bad and evil!**

Sure, I agree. Some are. Some hedge funds get their funding from managing pensions and endowments funds.

**8. But Citadel was manipulating the markets!**

Citadel and Citadel securities are two separate LLCs. They are only allowed to open long positions, they can not short a stock. One is a market maker that processes option orders and has no say in the markets. In fact, the more volume there is, the more money they make on the spreads. Would jot be surprised if Citadel made a lot of money on market making in the past week.

**9. But Hedge funds are insane investors with 50% annual return.**

Not necessarily true, an average hedge fund has been underperforming for the past 20 years. You probably had better returns then them just by investing in index funds. Don't get me wrong, a lot of smart people work in the funds, but their main goal is to hedge, in other words, be safe from market movements in any direction.

So as I said in my OP, I don't think that's what happened. So no. Should you have anticipated a shitty broker like robinhood having liquidity issues when every one of fucking customer piles into a single stock? I dunno, maybe. I wasn't trading GME, so I didn't really think about it. But perhaps you should have.

> Guess that has happened to you before and you saw this coming.


Did I specifically see a broker halt coming? No. But I knew that ""WSB declares war on hedge funds"" headlines with euphoria leading every other fucking retail trader to pile into a stock wasn't gonna end well. So my solution was to *not play GME.* Didn't buy or sell a single share. If I had, I would've done so with the understanding that it was a complete gamble, and there were no rules. And I would've taken profits when they were there.

But I don't really fucking know what your point is tbh, because nowhere in my post did I claim to have played GME and played it perfectly. My point is that you can't enter a market where big money controls everything, then claim you got robbed when big money controls something.

Dude, that's literally the entire point of my post. You can't go all-in on a squeeze, then act like you got robbed when broker liquidity issues stop the squeeze. You can't predict it, but you have to know shit like that can happen, and plan accordingly. You're making my point.

Fun fact, the people everyone‚Äôs whining about aren‚Äôt even the ones at fault. It‚Äôs the DTC/NSCC at the heart of the naked short issue and bigger companies and people with more money have tried to make noise about it before and failed.

The only outcome of this congressional hearing that is already being set up is T+0 clearing time which will **actually make the issue worse** by making it easier to disguise FTDs.

It isn‚Äôt a fair game, but we all knew that going in.

Yes it wasn‚Äôt fair, but the game was never fair and all the information about these practices is public and had been discussed endlessly. I‚Äôm
still happy to hold for a GME turnaround cuz I got in at 20 and do have my options profit (268K), but the fact that I didn‚Äôt sell is on me. Knowing someone might pull a dirty trick counts as risk - none of the behavior that happened was new or surprising we just all hoped for a second that it wouldn‚Äôt happen and forgot that it always happens.",whateverathrowaway00,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/line54/i_cant_believe_i_have_to_say_this_but_a_lot_of/gn8zyjy/,0.078,0.754,0.168,0.9794

‚ÄúCommon misconceptions about markets

First of all, I want to start by saying that some hedge funds are shady fucks. There are a lot of things they did that were shady. Here are a few examples:

[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp)

Now I want to address some of the misconceptions that new traders have about the markets.

1. **I was not allowed to buy shares on RH, did they wanted to drive the price down!?**

DTCC, the clearinghouse for WeBull, RH and other brokerages, recently raised the collateral requirements for GameStop transactions to nearly 100%.

When RH takes a buy order it goes to it's clearinghouse to exchange it's clients money for shares. The shares are immediately and conveniently transferred to the client, but the funds aren‚Äôt transferred for 2 days. There's this gap between the broker and the clearinghouse for these unsettled trades that the clearinghouse will require some cash upfront (margin) for but otherwise accepts exposure for the rest.

If the stock being bought is extremely volatile, expensive and has a huge amount of recent volume and therefore unsettled trades, the clearinghouse will eventually realize they are floating quite a lot more to the broker than they are comfortable with on the back of a very risky equity. GME fits all these characteristics. It's this point in the GME scenario where DTCC sets margin requirements to 100%. They tell their brokers, ""Hey if you want to get GME stock from us, we will not accept your word that this trade will settle in two days. Instead we need the money upfront since we are already way too exposed to this one ticker from you.""

Now, if RH wants to continue filling buy orders for it's clients it needs to come up with ALL the money for each trade. RH does not have nearly enough cash on hand to handle this, hence the recent draw down from of RH's credit lines as they try to get enough liquidity to keep buying shares for their clients. Eventually the brokers just don't have enough cash, throw in the towel and stop accepting buy orders until they can settle more trades or the clearinghouses release the margin requirements for these stocks.

The concept that RH would fuck over basically their entire user base on purpose to help a minority investor's minority investment in a hedge fund that already closed their fucking short position doesn't stand up to even the smallest amount of scrutiny. It's just a boring case of the market plumping going wild because it's not built to handle pumps of this scale.

**2. But I was allowed to sell!**

Of course you were. Selling is exiting an already created position. The liability that RH would get if you were not able to sell and the price went down would be insane. They can not stop you from selling an asset that you own. They can, however, block the purchasing of new assets through their platform.

Updated Information:

The DTC only requires collateral on the buying side of the trade. That is the side at risk because the buyer might have bought on margin or with funds that haven't fully settled in their brokerage account (like RH's instant deposit). There is no guarantee that the buyer actually has all the money to complete the trade until it clears 2 days later.
On the sell side, however, you're sending stock to the DTC which doesn't have the same sort of questionable backing. They can accept that stock with a high level of confidence and debit the broker's clearing firm whatever the stock was to have sold for. So selling is pretty easy for a broker because they can debit you and get a reliable debit from DTC which clears the immediate credit risk for the broker.
DTC is the one left holding the bag if the buyer fails to come through. [I'm not 100% sure about the next part, but I think it's right.] DTC will then keep the collateral payment as well as sell the orphaned stock at market price to recoup part of the loss and write off the rest (or they might make a profit if the stock rose in value during the clearing process). This is where another risk to DTC comes in - if the buyer defaults and the orphaned stock drops steeply in value during the settlement period (as $GME is very likely to do), then they have to rely on the collateral for most of their coverage. That's why they raised collateral for $GME.
Back to the original point, Robinhood didn't shut down selling because of liability risk - but because they simply didn't need to do that. DTC was only making buys difficult to complete.


**3. But Fidelity and ThinkorSwim allowed people to buy and sell.**

Thinkorswim and Fidelity own their own clearing houses and have enough shares to satisfy the orders. Also, they do not need to pay collateral since they are a clearing house.

**4. Okay, but what about the 120% short interest, Melvin will be closing their position soon, and a short squeeze will happen.**

Melvin claims that they closed some of their positions. There was enough volume for them to do so. 

The short interest are just estimations. Short interest information gets released on 15th and 30th of each month. Next week we will be able to see the short positions.

Hedge funds keep taking short positions and are much better prepared for now, because there is more money to be made on riding a stock down to 40 from 400, then from 5 to 1.

The whole assumption for a short squeeze incoming is built around the assumption that there is still short interest of over 100%, however, there is not confirmed data, as it comes out on 2/9.

Many hedge funds are also riding the wave up, and have long positions in GME. Blackrock, one of the biggest money managers already made insane profit, and will probably ride this on a way down.

**5. But a short squeeze will happen!**

It could, or it could not. The interest in not high to a point were they will go bankrupt or have to buy back the shares to cover. They can comfortably hold for 6-12 month as long as they don‚Äôt get margin called, which I don‚Äôt expect them too, tbh. The payoff makes sense, think about it this way. The interest is I think 30% yearly. Let‚Äôs say you short a billion dollars worth GME. You pay annual interest of 30-40%. Hedge funds definitely have enough money to pay that 300 million a year. Now, let‚Äôs say in a year a price goes down from 400 to 40. A fund will make essentially 900 million dollars minus the interest fee and etc. it is a no brainer for some bigger funds to take this position and enjoy their easy 40% profit.

Considering many funds have insane amounts of collateral, they will not get margin called from this.

**6. But if options expire in the money they have to sell their shares!**

A lot of options expired ITM on Friday, so why did the price not go up?

Well, how many retail investors that were holding their options actually had enough money to buy 100 shares at a strike price? Not too many.

Additional information:

Assigned/exercised options move stock between people/institutions. However, this movement does not affect the current stock price. (UNLESS someone sold uncovered calls).
The volume of calls or puts being assigned does not matter.
Example: stock ABC closes at $11 on expiration. Investor A owns a $10 call, and it is exercised. The seller of the call (investor B)  already owns the shares (or owns another call at different strike). The following transaction occurs: Investor A gives B $1000, Investor B gives A 100 shares of stock ABC.
IIRC, no volume is reported for ABC, neither a buy nor a sell occurred, and ACB price does not change.
IF they were uncovered calls (not really allowed, its significantly more risk than naked shorts), then Investor B would need to by 100 shares of ABC at current price, prior to the call being exercised.

**7. Okay, but Hedge funds are still bad and evil!**

Sure, I agree. Some are. Some hedge funds get their funding from managing pensions and endowments funds.

**8. But Citadel was manipulating the markets!**

Citadel and Citadel securities are two separate LLCs. They are only allowed to open long positions, they can not short a stock. One is a market maker that processes option orders and has no say in the markets. In fact, the more volume there is, the more money they make on the spreads. Would jot be surprised if Citadel made a lot of money on market making in the past week.

**9. But Hedge funds are insane investors with 50% annual return.**

Not necessarily true, an average hedge fund has been underperforming for the past 20 years. You probably had better returns then them just by investing in index funds. Don't get me wrong, a lot of smart people work in the funds, but their main goal is to hedge, in other words, be safe from market movements in any direction.

**TL;DR**

Hedge funds are bad, but they are not retarded (except for Melvin, who overextends on a short at $5)

But many of the rules that came in play were written decades ago, they were not taken from thin air. Battling against hedge funds is okay, but throwing different theories that will be easily disapproved once they file 13F will not take them down. Knowing how markets work, and being vigilant is how you make more money than hedge funds.‚Äù",Lardass_Goober,-7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/line54/i_cant_believe_i_have_to_say_this_but_a_lot_of/gn4pu76/,0.068,0.81,0.122,0.9983

First of all, I want to start by saying that some hedge funds are shady fucks. There are a lot of things they did that were shady. Here are a few examples:

[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp)

Now I want to address some of the misconceptions that new traders have about the markets.

1. **I was not allowed to buy shares on RH, did they wanted to drive the price down!?**

DTCC, the clearinghouse for WeBull, RH and other brokerages, recently raised the collateral requirements for GameStop transactions to nearly 100%.

When RH takes a buy order it goes to it's clearinghouse to exchange it's clients money for shares. The shares are immediately and conveniently transferred to the client, but the funds aren‚Äôt transferred for 2 days. There's this gap between the broker and the clearinghouse for these unsettled trades that the clearinghouse will require some cash upfront (margin) for but otherwise accepts exposure for the rest.

If the stock being bought is extremely volatile, expensive and has a huge amount of recent volume and therefore unsettled trades, the clearinghouse will eventually realize they are floating quite a lot more to the broker than they are comfortable with on the back of a very risky equity. GME fits all these characteristics. It's this point in the GME scenario where DTCC sets margin requirements to 100%. They tell their brokers, ""Hey if you want to get GME stock from us, we will not accept your word that this trade will settle in two days. Instead we need the money upfront since we are already way too exposed to this one ticker from you.""

Now, if RH wants to continue filling buy orders for it's clients it needs to come up with ALL the money for each trade. RH does not have nearly enough cash on hand to handle this, hence the recent draw down from of RH's credit lines as they try to get enough liquidity to keep buying shares for their clients. Eventually the brokers just don't have enough cash, throw in the towel and stop accepting buy orders until they can settle more trades or the clearinghouses release the margin requirements for these stocks.

The concept that RH would fuck over basically their entire user base on purpose to help a minority investor's minority investment in a hedge fund that already closed their fucking short position doesn't stand up to even the smallest amount of scrutiny. It's just a boring case of the market plumping going wild because it's not built to handle pumps of this scale.

**2. But I was allowed to sell!**

Of course you were. Selling is exiting an already created position. The liability that RH would get if you were not able to sell and the price went down would be insane. They can not stop you from selling an asset that you own. They can, however, block the purchasing of new assets through their platform.

Updated Information:

The DTC only requires collateral on the buying side of the trade. That is the side at risk because the buyer might have bought on margin or with funds that haven't fully settled in their brokerage account (like RH's instant deposit). There is no guarantee that the buyer actually has all the money to complete the trade until it clears 2 days later.
On the sell side, however, you're sending stock to the DTC which doesn't have the same sort of questionable backing. They can accept that stock with a high level of confidence and debit the broker's clearing firm whatever the stock was to have sold for. So selling is pretty easy for a broker because they can debit you and get a reliable debit from DTC which clears the immediate credit risk for the broker.
DTC is the one left holding the bag if the buyer fails to come through. [I'm not 100% sure about the next part, but I think it's right.] DTC will then keep the collateral payment as well as sell the orphaned stock at market price to recoup part of the loss and write off the rest (or they might make a profit if the stock rose in value during the clearing process). This is where another risk to DTC comes in - if the buyer defaults and the orphaned stock drops steeply in value during the settlement period (as $GME is very likely to do), then they have to rely on the collateral for most of their coverage. That's why they raised collateral for $GME.
Back to the original point, Robinhood didn't shut down selling because of liability risk - but because they simply didn't need to do that. DTC was only making buys difficult to complete.


**3. But Fidelity and ThinkorSwim allowed people to buy and sell.**

Thinkorswim and Fidelity own their own clearing houses and have enough shares to satisfy the orders. Also, they do not need to pay collateral since they are a clearing house.

**4. Okay, but what about the 120% short interest, Melvin will be closing their position soon, and a short squeeze will happen.**

Melvin claims that they closed some of their positions. There was enough volume for them to do so. 

The short interest are just estimations. Short interest information gets released on 15th and 30th of each month. Next week we will be able to see the short positions.

Hedge funds keep taking short positions and are much better prepared for now, because there is more money to be made on riding a stock down to 40 from 400, then from 5 to 1.

The whole assumption for a short squeeze incoming is built around the assumption that there is still short interest of over 100%, however, there is not confirmed data, as it comes out on 2/9.

Many hedge funds are also riding the wave up, and have long positions in GME. Blackrock, one of the biggest money managers already made insane profit, and will probably ride this on a way down.

**5. But a short squeeze will happen!**

It could, or it could not. The interest in not high to a point were they will go bankrupt or have to buy back the shares to cover. They can comfortably hold for 6-12 month as long as they don‚Äôt get margin called, which I don‚Äôt expect them too, tbh. The payoff makes sense, think about it this way. The interest is I think 30% yearly. Let‚Äôs say you short a billion dollars worth GME. You pay annual interest of 30-40%. Hedge funds definitely have enough money to pay that 300 million a year. Now, let‚Äôs say in a year a price goes down from 400 to 40. A fund will make essentially 900 million dollars minus the interest fee and etc. it is a no brainer for some bigger funds to take this position and enjoy their easy 40% profit.

Considering many funds have insane amounts of collateral, they will not get margin called from this.

**6. But if options expire in the money they have to sell their shares!**

A lot of options expired ITM on Friday, so why did the price not go up?

Well, how many retail investors that were holding their options actually had enough money to buy 100 shares at a strike price? Not too many.

Additional information:

Assigned/exercised options move stock between people/institutions. However, this movement does not affect the current stock price. (UNLESS someone sold uncovered calls).
The volume of calls or puts being assigned does not matter.
Example: stock ABC closes at $11 on expiration. Investor A owns a $10 call, and it is exercised. The seller of the call (investor B)  already owns the shares (or owns another call at different strike). The following transaction occurs: Investor A gives B $1000, Investor B gives A 100 shares of stock ABC.
IIRC, no volume is reported for ABC, neither a buy nor a sell occurred, and ACB price does not change.
IF they were uncovered calls (not really allowed, its significantly more risk than naked shorts), then Investor B would need to by 100 shares of ABC at current price, prior to the call being exercised.

**7. Okay, but Hedge funds are still bad and evil!**

Sure, I agree. Some are. Some hedge funds get their funding from managing pensions and endowments funds.

**8. But Citadel was manipulating the markets!**

Citadel and Citadel securities are two separate LLCs. They are only allowed to open long positions, they can not short a stock. One is a market maker that processes option orders and has no say in the markets. In fact, the more volume there is, the more money they make on the spreads. Would jot be surprised if Citadel made a lot of money on market making in the past week.

**9. But Hedge funds are insane investors with 50% annual return.**

Not necessarily true, an average hedge fund has been underperforming for the past 20 years. You probably had better returns then them just by investing in index funds. Don't get me wrong, a lot of smart people work in the funds, but their main goal is to hedge, in other words, be safe from market movements in any direction.

**TL;DR**

Hedge funds are bad, but they are not retarded (except for Melvin, who overextends on a short at $5)

But many of the rules that came in play were written decades ago, they were not taken from thin air. Battling against hedge funds is okay, but throwing different theories that will be easily disapproved once they file 13F will not take them down. Knowing how markets work, and being vigilant is how you make more money than hedge funds.‚Äù",Lardass_Goober,-7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/line54/i_cant_believe_i_have_to_say_this_but_a_lot_of/gn4pu76/,0.068,0.81,0.122,0.9983

1077,GME," 100% agree. I keep wondering what will happen to the markets when WSB discovers buying puts on a stock. It‚Äôs fair to hope that GME is worth more than the $5-$15 it was last Fall, especially if they spend a year or two on a turn around. But it‚Äôs also obvious that that‚Äôs not now... I happily bought a series of puts against GME on the way up (from February - June of this year, and then Jan 2021 and 2022 for <$40 and as low as <$5), and they‚Äôve been paying out 30% easily. Can see some serious potential for the future ones after GME earnings (after which the stock historically almost always drops). Anyway, why do I say this?

Mostly did passive investing over the past 2 years as opposed to actively trading. Just stating my current logic based more on sentiment which may actually be retarded.**

I'm also actually interested in FUBO right now. It's one of the holdings that is part of the new SUBZ ETF that just hit the market this month. By this virtue, I expect it to see some sort of increased interest, whether individually as a stock or because of the ETF allocations. Looks like it had a massive spike in Dec. and then corrected in Jan, but has been having some upward trend.

More particularly, just pulling a small excerpt from some news on FUBO via TDA -""There are so many better stocks than **Fubotv Inc** (NYSE: FUBO), said Cramer. He is not against it if you actually own it.""

Apparently Cramer made a fairly ""neutral"" comment about FUBO to his boomer crowd, but it still implies the connotation to me that they (boomer crowd) shouldn't increase their position in it which can possibly be taken further to dumb people following his every word thinking they should reduce because they may miss opportunity elsewhere.

Between of the ETF interest and Cramer's ""neutral"" stance, I speculate there may be a chance for very short-term gains, then a self off cycle and a dip as previous longs want to realize some gains, and then opportunity to reposition for longer-term in the dip. If he said it was a good buy and I already had stake, I'd probably be priming myself to jump off it.

Looks like it's sitting at about 21% Institutional Holdings with (dare I mention this) 36.5% SI. I wouldn't be surprised at all to see the Institutional rise after a dip and the SI decrease as they also try to reposition in short vs. long cycles.

1280,GME," look at my post history for the long explanation

OP is kinda right kinda wrong .. the $20p isn't a play that tesla will go down, it is a play on the low volatility that tesla stock currently has

Dec 2020 = vol was at 130% (or so)

Jan 2021 = vol was at 85% or so

Feb 2021 = vol is at 70%

The buyer of the $20p paid $.025 for the calls that are currently worth $.04. They have already almost doubled their money

If TSLA goes to 85% volatility, the $.04 pumps to around $.12, a 200% gain

If TSLA goes to 100% vol, the $.04 jumps to $.50

I know this will happen because when GME vol went through the fucking roof my march $10p went from $1 to $1.5 (or something like that) with GME going from $120 to $480

Volatility is just that ... it doesn't care what direction the stonk moves, it just cares that it happens deeply and quickly. 

You could do this with equally retarded OTM calls also as the direction of the stock doesn't matter at all .. all that matters is that tesla makes big moves in price in a very short amount of time.

1281,TSLA," look at my post history for the long explanation

OP is kinda right kinda wrong .. the $20p isn't a play that tesla will go down, it is a play on the low volatility that tesla stock currently has

Dec 2020 = vol was at 130% (or so)

Jan 2021 = vol was at 85% or so

Feb 2021 = vol is at 70%

The buyer of the $20p paid $.025 for the calls that are currently worth $.04. They have already almost doubled their money

If TSLA goes to 85% volatility, the $.04 pumps to around $.12, a 200% gain

If TSLA goes to 100% vol, the $.04 jumps to $.50

I know this will happen because when GME vol went through the fucking roof my march $10p went from $1 to $1.5 (or something like that) with GME going from $120 to $480

Volatility is just that ... it doesn't care what direction the stonk moves, it just cares that it happens deeply and quickly. 

You could do this with equally retarded OTM calls also as the direction of the stock doesn't matter at all .. all that matters is that tesla makes big moves in price in a very short amount of time. 

The $500k already invested is worth $1mm, if TSLA sells off to the $700 range in one week, then the IV will get jacked up and the $500k will be worth $10,000,000-ish

1311,EV," Maybe there will be more Teslas on the American roads by the end of 2022, but Tesla won‚Äôt have more than 50% of EVs sold in the US in 2022. 

Tesla won‚Äôt be able to sell more than 1 million cars per year in the US by the end of 2022. There will be over 1 million non-Tesla EVs sold in the US in 2022. Altogether, there will be about 19 million new cars, SUVs and light trucks sold in the US in 2022, so the total number of EVs will make up about 11% of all new vehicle sales in the US in 2022, of which more than half will be non-Tesla EVa. In other words, my projection is that in 2022, one of every 9 vehicles sold in the US will be an EV, but Tesla will make less than 50% of them. By 2030, Tesla‚Äôs market share in the US EV sales will drop below 10%. By the time new ICE vehicles sales are banned in the US (probably 2040), Tesla‚Äôs overall market share of new vehicles will drop to below 5% globally (and in the US). 

Tesla‚Äôs problem is that the more cars they make, the more money they lose. They are only saved by selling regulatory credits to other car manufacturers to offset their losses with. It‚Äôs very likely they will have no one to sell the credits to (or the price of the credits will fall precipitously) in 2022. In fact, Musk might decide to limit the production output to reduce the losses until Tesla figures out how to build their vehicles profitably.

1325,IRS," If this is a serious question: Pull out enough to cover worst-case tax burden right away. Either send it straight to the IRS, or drop it into no-risk options like CDs.

Next pay off every single debt you have.

With the rest split it into thirds, with 1/3 going into some traditional retirement or index funds, 1/3 into something higher-yield but riskier like real estate and rental properties, and using the final 1/3 as spending cash to improve your life.

That ""improve your life fund"" shouldn't be some kind of ""YOLO go crazy"" fund, but something like getting a good car, buying a nice house or condo, updating your wardrobe, and keeping you in enough spending cash so you can generally do what you want as long as you don't go crazy.

Don't go on a spending spree! If you go crazy buying stuff you're going to burn through your money fast than you thought possible. Instead just buy stuff you'd normally be realistically buying, but spend the money on higher quality.

Don't quit your job unless it's a crappy job. The routine of a job can be a stabilizing factor for a lot of people. Also, when you don't *need* the job, and have the ability to walk at any time if it gets bad, will relieve almost all the stress related to a job.

***Don't tell anyone how much money you have.*** If they wonder how you bought a house/etc, just say you've been saving up and had a good year in the market - but don't ever give specifics. Don't tell them how much you have, just say ""I got enough to get a down payment on a  house"" (or whatever they'll notice you bought), but don't elaborate past that.

Get personal liability umbrella insurance. This will protect you in case someone sues you for something random. It can often just be added to a rider on home owners or renters insurance depending on the company. Talk to an insurance agent to find out specifics.

The actual float of Class A (public) shares is only about $2.1B right now, so with approximately $630MM of stock short right now out of the $2.1B float and RKT‚Äôs buyback of another $950MM coming up, you are looking at a legitimate short squeeze at any moment.  Also, paying credence to your Class D to Class A conversion, Class D shares are not eligible for Dividends and Distributions, but the Class A are, and last Quarter states that they would use their massive excess cash flow for A.) Stock Buybacks, and B.) Initiating a Potential Dividend.  We all know Buffet likes stocks that distribute dividends to shareholders.

Normally with IPO stock heavy short interest is common and slowly unwinds over time as another poster said. Also, the numbers and structure are different than GME.

However, there may be a bit of a mini-squeeze if we get the ER run-up and the ""big partnership"" is seen a beneficial to the point the stock is unlikely to drop back below their original short sale point. Likely we'd just get something closer to a ""real"" valuation then (my estimate is $30's minimum and likely upper $40's depending on Q4 results), but in a blue sky scenario (Buffet+good Q4+Retail interest) I don't see at least a short pop above $50 to be out of the question.",CharlesLupton,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/limbmv/rkt_ready_for_takeoff/gn9fp7y/,0.025,0.935,0.04,0.2732

1597,GME," I agree, plus if you keep track of your put profits, you will quickly find that you are playing with house money when you get assigned, or your initial capital at risk has been heavily reduced.

I think I am rocking about $13.00 in credit from selling the 40 puts in GME at this point, so my real risk has been reduced massively.

Also as you scale into your position, you can either take the credits and increase your position or keep your position the same and use that credit elsewhere.

or you can even buyback your puts for 1.00 profit and be like ok I just made $100.00, GME is trading at $50.00 I can buy 1 share by way of limit order, then keep shorting the same while keeping $50.00 in profit.

There are so many better ways to play this situation, it is absolutely mind blowing how people just run in there and market order shares.

If people were more patient, then we could easily force an infinity squeeze in 3 to 5 years.

1677,GME," How   about actually using volume  profile and technical analysis to find   areas of support and resistance  and then using short puts to begin to   scale into a position?

I keep seeing people just run in there with a market order and then sell 20 seconds later when it dips down for a split second.

Stop    using stop losses as well, the big firms have access to what is  called   ""depth of book"" which allows them to see all the orders on the  book so   they can stop run and shake the idiots out.

Also    if you get a good entry near support, you can practice proper risk    management and not have to worry about so much about the stock going    down in the near term.

plus if you keep track of your put  profits, you will quickly find that you are playing with house money  when you get assigned, or your initial capital at risk has been heavily  reduced.

I think I am rocking  about $13.00 in credit from selling the 40 puts in GME at this point, so  my real risk has been reduced massively.

Also  as you scale into your position, you can either take the credits and  increase your position or keep your position the same and use that  credit elsewhere.

or you can even  buyback your puts for 1.00 profit and be like ok I just made $100.00,  GME is trading at $50.00 I can buy 1 share by way of limit order, then  keep shorting the same while keeping $50.00 in profit.

There  are so many better ways to play this situation, it is absolutely mind  blowing how people just run in there and market order shares.

If people were more patient, then we could easily force an infinity squeeze in 3 to 5 years.

It would take decades before the business catches up to its valuation unless all other car, battery, and alternative energy companies stop innovating and producing. The cars even look lame from the outside. Elon had a problem with the shorts and he somehow engineered an exit. Rational arguments don't apply here. 

Now, thinking that GME will take off like TSLA is extremely retarded. Yes, the company is in a dying brick and mortar business. But all Cohen needs to do is to reframe it as a ""technology company"".

1741,WORK," I will reply seriously to this.

First of all, do not let anybody shame you for your choice of technologies and stack. Your job is to solve problems, to provide value. Technology is just means to an end, not the end itself. If you are comfortable and productive using Mongo, then by all means keep being productive. It will be much more beneficial in the long run. Stick to your guns and preserve. No startup that failed had their users say ""how could X fail? They used kubernetes!!!"". Your users don't care what your software is written in as long as it provides value.

---

Now - here is my personal mongodb from hell story. At around 2013-2015 we were building some proto-image recognition software that would be used by many many users. Since our partners (the users ""belonged"" to our partner, they would be hitting our servers by proxy) were very strict on privacy and security, we would need to host our servers within their own datacenter. This would give us the added benefit of being able to ask for the best hardware available. We were not allowed to be in the DC, but we could call them 24/7 and request anything we wanted. Anyway... We ran mongodb across 3 physical machines with 64gb of ram each (though it ran in VMs not in host OS of course). That would be really good hardware today, but it was absolutely top of the line back then. The software that was running mongo was written a 3rd party provider, however we would self-host that software - again due to privacy concerns.
Around 1 year in... an ""unclean shutdown"" occurs. What is an unclean shutdown? It's datacenter lingo for ""the inbred intern tripped on the power switch, yo"". Power's out!
Ok, not a problem, power is back in less than 30 seconds (was it backup power? I don't know) - all servers reboot properly, and continue their smooth operations. All except... you guessed it, mongo fucking db. Refuses to start, ""corrupted shard <shard_id>"" error msg.

Ok let's follow the protocol. Restore from backup, restore functionality then repair the prod servers. Problem #2 mongodb won't restore from back up. Are our backups corrupted? Nope, our backups work fine. We test our backups monthly. However MONGO DB BACKUPS DON'T WORK.
Ok... Now it's getting a stressful. I 'm mentally counting seconds, tick tock our SLA policy is minutes from us having to answer to stakeholders on this failure. You never want to face downtime with no other option than frantically searching on stackoverflow for answers. Ideally when faced with downtime you want to be a sharpshooter that knows already the answer. Or at least to have a hunch on what might be going on (eg, oh look there are more than 65k inodes in use and filesystem fails, maybe the ""intern that jerks off in the bathroom"" forgot to call ""fclose"" after calling fopen 65k times. Let's up the inode limit, and scoure our codebase for unmatched fopen statements. We do not know for sure what's going on, but we have a very good hunch on what might be going on!! Not so much with mongo...)

We 're on the phone with the 3rd party software provider whose software we self-host. We 're on the phone with the datacenter people. And we 're trying to get on the phone with mongo.. well we 're not, because they never answered.

Meanwhile, we are running mongod repair on the backup instance. It doesn't give a time estimate, but it appears to be running (resource utilization is up).
*3.5 hours later*

Oh yeah, that's how long it took, 3.5 hours, to restore a 120gb mongodb database, distributed across 3 nodes. 3.5 hours of fucking downtime. Why is it even decentralized if it goes down when 1 node is down?  Meanwhile a 300gb postgresql single-server db was up and running on its own, as if nothing happened. It boggles my mind, and i get angry just writing this post. The whole point of distributed databases is no-single-point-of-failure failover policy. In the 10 year lifespan of that company, that was the most catastrophic downtime event we ever encountered.


Now you might say. ""You 're fucking stupid, you used a database without knowing how to restore it when it fails, of course you got fucked"". And you would be 100% correct. We used mongo because the 3rd-party software we self-hosted required it. Nobody really knew how to actually use it, and perhaps if we knew how to fix it, it would have taken 2 minutes and not 3.5 hours. But that's the fucking point. Mongo doesn't warn you about this. It's not a known scenario, there is no ""here's what you do if your backup doesn't work"" story. Mongo's pitch is that it just works, and it scales horizontally without you having to do shit. This is a blatand lie.
In contrast, SQL databases are very forth coming on how they might break and how to prevent it. Postgresl is 35 years old, it has matured and all failure scenarios are known, to the point you can be 100% comfortable at night, because even if things explode at 3am on new years eve - we know how to repair! Miss Mongo just ghosts you leaving you wondering what the hell you said wrong.

In the end what happened was similar to what happened to foursquare a few years prior - https://mashable.com/2010/10/05/foursquare-downtime-post-mortem/ shard needed to be reindexed, and it took fucking forever.
Except foursquare's downtime took 12 hours. However they were able to get after a few hours a mongo rep on the phone! 
What's scarier is that foursquare's downtime was 6 years prior to ours. Did they not fix their issues in those 6 years?

See, many people think that newer software is better ""oh it fixed all the bugs"". That is rarely the case. If let's say there are 3 bugs in 1000 lines of code. Then 5 years from now, if 1,000,0000 lines of code are added, there are 3000 more bugs! Code is a liability.
Only videogames tend to get more stable as time goes on, because the scope is defined. Their teams do not spend their time adding new features, but improvng the existing ones. In the world of enterprise software it's all about new features, and many times its even about bug-to-bug compatibility.

Anyway, to make a long story short. We dropped that software, and replaced it with an ElasticSearch based one which is working fine to this day (even though elasticsearch is a resource hog and even heavier than mongo, it has been a lot more reliable).

Again - if you are proficient with mongo stick to it. Chances are if we had 1, just 1, experienced mongo dev we might have had a happier story to tell. But keep in mind that mongo (the company) tries to mislead devs on how robust their software is and the ways it can fail - and when you have very tight SLAs, I would pick sleeping calmly at night, above any technology that might burst into flames in a moment's notice.",CrazyFrenchLadies,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj1vhs/dd_cloudflare_net_is_going_to_continue_its_strong/gnaowh0/,0.076,0.846,0.078,-0.8439

1776,AMD," A little background info. In 2017 AMD released their zen architecture, and soon after they released zen 2 architecture. They were a commercial success in a time where AMD had something like 10% of all sales or less. Intell fell behind and is not catching up.
Before that, AMD really invested in using PCIe lanes to connect two (or maybe more) processors in the future together. PCIe is an open standard that is used by tons of companies. Intel uses their weird proprietary standard, that has real issues in terms of performance. When AMD needs more performance between chips they just use more PCIe lanes.
Speaking of which, those PCIe lanes are also used to connect high-speed fibreoptic networking equipment. The latest version of PCIe is 4.0, only supported with AMD cpu's. Intel who also makes network cards, had to delay their newest generation network card because it had no intel processor with PCIe 4.0.

Remember that AMD has experience with graphics cards? Yeah the sales for that sucked, but it gave them something else. They have some graphics cards which uses so called HBM memory. Memory that's faster than regular computer memory. This means they have some experience and  technology in house to mitigate an anticipated problem with next gen computers. They have experience with GDDR memory, with DDR, and with HBM. Intel has experience with DDR memory only. There are also rumors that some of that fancy memory will end up on the newer generation AMD chips, boosting their performance even more. I don't remember Intel being that innovative since the forced jump to 64 bit processors that AMD caused them to do about 20 years back.

Intel seems to still be investing heavily in chips that have less cores but higher speed per core, and AMD seems to do thesame, plus they just double the amounth of cores Intel uses. This gives AMD an edge because they just have to double the core count to keep up with intel which is easy for them now, and then every other thing will put them further ahead.

Right now, the fastest server chip is a ‚Ç¨7.000,- AMD chip costing 30% less than the best Intel chip. It also has twice the performance. 
So to get similar performance you'd have to spend ‚Ç¨20.000,- on Intel chips. People who build datacenters know this, and they are switching over to AMD. Some are still grasping to intel out of historic bias, but that'll die off over the years.
The enteusiast consumer switched already, or plans to when their next pc dies. (These are the people you ask what your next pc should be for ‚Ç¨500,- , and they'll probably will recommend AMD from now on.) AMD seems to be also rising on the laptop market, although I don't really have any sales data on that. Only in a select few workloads is it still favourably on Intel, and I can only see that dwindling.

This all AMD in an immensely greater position than Intel. Please correct me if I said something wrong.

On a sidenote, I'd personally like to invest in a chip producer called SiFive if I could.

1839,TLS," > and encrypts your network requests

_Aaaaackshally_

1.1.1.1 is a DNS server (to drastically simplify things), it isn't encrypting anything unless you're encrypting first. The standard for DNS is unencrypted, but things like DNS over HTTPS and DNS over TLS or even tunneling DNS thru a VPN are all viable options. 

Cloudflare offers a (pseudo, last time I checked) free VPN service called WARP, which is available as an app. Using that app, your DNS queries _would_ be encrypted. They offer a subscription service of WARP (WARP+) that is a true VPN. I'm not sure what their business model is for the free tier, but I assume I'm the product in it.

If you just set 1.1.1.1 as your DNS server without enabling DoH/DoT or something else, DNS isn't getting encrypted. Firefox started offering DoH as a default setting a while ago, and I think the default config for it is to use Cloudflare, so that's something. As an aside, encrypted DNS is kind of a pain in the ass in an enterprise environment.

The other question is how much you _trust_ Cloudflare. They know every domain you query, which basically means they know what you're doing online. Are they monetizing that? Leaving any of the philosophical aspects aside, if that is a core business component, any impending regulation/legislation poses a risk to that revenue stream. Not that I think there's any real chance here given the power and size of data aggregators, but there's always talk of privacy regulations, etc. 

Separately, like most other hosting providers, Cloudflare has had their fair share of cybercrime issues in the past (i.e. criminals using Cloudflare for hosting). At one point, most DDoS-as-a-service markets were sitting on Cloudflare infrastructure, all the while Cloudflare is selling DDoS-mitigation services to everyone they can. I _think_ they've gotten better in that regard, but it's hard to find much other than C-level statements about ""security is important.""

All of that to say, I personally use 1.1.1.1 because it's _screaming fast_ and Cloudflare doesn't fuck with domain resolution like my ISP and I trust them _slightly_ more than Google (even tho El Goog already knows *everything about me*).",thisisyourbestoption,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/limwgf/cloudflare_net_has_made_my_dick_hard_for_more/gn4oyrc/,0.055,0.828,0.117,0.9761

1878,LOVE," Just my opinion as a father with two kids that LOVE Roblox: older one played from age 7 to 12.  Youngest started at 6, she's 9 now and is NOT sick of it.  The brilliant thing is that the owners don't develop the games, nerds from their basements do and company takes a big cut of micro transactions. So new developers are constantly at the ready and getting paid.  Sure there are only a few games within that are uber popular, but they go in waves,  replaced with new games and new reasons for kids to buy stupid shit with their parents money. Therefore...

1.  Roblox isn't running out of new games based on the outside developer model.
2. The world isn't running out of 6 to 11 year-olds.

This thing is gonna be around making shit tons of money for a LONG time. Buy it early.",imtheroth,25,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lio5fh/roblox_listing_coming_in_march_thoughts/gn4g07s/,0.1,0.81,0.09,-0.764

I would take what people on here are saying with a grain of salt. Look at the S1 document on Sec.gov yourself and look at their growth.

On the reataik consumers side people have been looking for a reason to drop them for a long time due to they're anti consumer practices. Bribery, intimidation, new mobo every other refresh, misleading benchmarks, high price.

The big one is the professional side, they aren't even competitive anymore. Most new contracts are AMD based due to huge price and performance advantages.

They no longer seem to have any real talent working on research and development. competive GPUs are a long way away if they ever even come.

They are stuck on 14nm which isn't necessarily the worst thing but the fact that they expected to be off it some time ago and can't seem to figure it out despite their massive R&D budget is concerning.

They went into auto pilot mode because they had no competition for a long time. Most of thier efforts were spent trying to maintain their position with PR and shady tactics rather than actually innovating. They stuck to 4 cores because they could and would still be on it if they had thier say.

1999,EV," Here is what is happening and what I think will happen. 

Something like 22% of all dollars have been created in the last year. That‚Äôs insane. What does that mean? There is money that needs a return and it sure as hell isn‚Äôt getting it sitting in the bank. That money will go into the real estate market and the stock market. People will be worried about hyperinflation but it‚Äôs unlikely to happen when you print tons of money in a pretty stagnant economy. Without the velocity of money increasing along with the rate of brrrrrr we won‚Äôt have hyper inflation as you‚Äôve read about in Germany and other places. 

There will probably be some assets that do inflate. They‚Äôll be the ones that rich people buy. All this printed money isn‚Äôt going to poor people. They will be most hurt by this because the rich will benefit by their rising asset prices and the poor will suffer because their wages won‚Äôt go up and housing will become increasingly unobtainable. If you are waiting for a housing market crash so you can buy... good luck. 

The government has created the greatest stimulus for people who own assets probably in history. Own real estate? You‚Äôll be fine as long as you can cover your payments and your lender doesn‚Äôt foreclose on you because you can‚Äôt find a paying tenant. Cap rates are super low. For those unfamiliar, a cap rate is how you value a property based on cash flow. Making $100k in net income from rentals and the market puts a 6% cap rate (expected return on value) then the building will be worth $100k/0.06= $1.67m. If you have the same income and interest rates are down and so are cap rates and the new market cap rate is 4%, then congratulations, your building is now worth $100k/.04=$2.5M. Cant raise rates because of all the debt. 

In other words, money was chasing yield (return) precovid. Now it is starved for yield, so people are forced to take a lower return and the value of assets goes up. So if you were happy making 6% owning some safe rental buildings but want to keep making that return you need to add risk to bring that 4% return up. Buy some equities. 

That said, if you look at TLT you‚Äôll see that rates are actually rising (indicated by a falling tlt value) somewhat surprisingly because the market is seeing risk rising. This is an important thing to watch because if rates keep rising the free money party will start charging admission at the door. 


If you are some rich guy flush with cash because your assets are inflating, what do you do? Buy physical goods like real estate but also classic cars, art, watches, etc. I have a collection of vintage watches that I bought as about a 5 year hold. The watch portfolio age is just about a year or so (as far as my ownership. They are all from the 1960s). I must be up 20% on them and I think there is more gain to come there. I see it as similar to owning metals but with actual utility because I can wear them too. 

Where does this brrrrr money go? It‚Äôll keep pumping the market. Along the way there will be several shocks to it (look at the chart end of 2018 for example) where the market goes, oh shit things are not alright. This will crush leveraged investors who can‚Äôt delever quickly and the paper hands out there. We‚Äôll have shocks and then the market will shrug its shoulders and carry on until something truly causes an uncoupling. I don‚Äôt see what stops it until wealth inequality reaches truly dire proportions. 

The scary thing is that Trump was a symptom of the anger people have of segments of society being left behind. Some large amount of the idiots arrested from the Jan 6 stupid-coup have a history of financial troubles. I don‚Äôt know how this ends but the have nots are not going to have a good time. 

What to do? Well, I‚Äôve gone from being very much in cash at the start of 2020 to being fully invested plus I‚Äôm currently running with my account leveraged by 20% but if you add the notional value of leaps Im also holding which are mostly ITM now my account‚Äôs exposure in double my cash value of it. I‚Äôm riding this train until it stops. I have 50-something positions and each week I move my stop orders up as the market rises. It‚Äôs much harder than people realize to trade out when stuff starts tanking but I‚Äôm hoping enough stops hit to protect my principal. Can it go down and wack my stops and the moon? Sure. But I‚Äôm running on leverage so it‚Äôll just deleverage me and having so many positions and so many different levels for stops should help me not be too paper hands. 

I don‚Äôt yolo but I do consider about 5% of my account to be for very risky option plays but it‚Äôs playing with gains. I try to stick with things I‚Äôll hold long terms but I‚Äôve also bought a lot of EV shit that has mooned and will likely go to zero someday because not all these EV companies are going to survive. Likely few will. But with goev for example, I‚Äôm in from $10. Im dumping of it goes down to $14 and will never look back. Still a nice return. If it keeps going up I‚Äôll just hold and hold. Margin is only like 2% so why dump anything that keeps going up until it goes parabolic like weed stocks did this week. You have to take profit on moves like that. 

Anyways, add slowly until you are in a position where you have gains. Then you have cushion to add more risk. Capital preservation first. Make gains and then try to risk gains only.

At a time when were 8% above, a 1.9 trillion stimulus is about to be unleashed at the same time as a vaccine glut could hit.

You can say it‚Äôs at 8% already because it‚Äôs pricing the stimulus and likely reopening in, but we haven‚Äôt actually seen the true effects of the 1.9 trillion until it‚Äôs actually out there. And we haven‚Äôt seen the effect of the vaccine until it‚Äôs actually happening.

Intel going 10nm is a good thing, however how it will stack up to AMDs 7nm especially in 2022 is a big question. One thing I do know is that Intel's 10nm is widening the devide and further splitting the market between performance and productivity, which ultimately is going to make the market more competitive, and price/performance is something that will have to be seen. Judging by Intel's previous generations, they'll have to make some big leaps to make that worth it for the customer.

As for portable and mobile platforms, this could be a good thing, and with 2021 being such a terrible year for desktop electronics in general this might be good breathing time to be looking at Intel moving forward.

I personally have bailed on upgrading my PC in 2021, this was the year to do a complete overhaul however due to the GPU issue I wont be buying anything from AMD or Intel, or Nvidia for that matter. Assuming my situation isn't isolated just to me it's fair to assume that average customers will be in similar mind sets, and I'm not convinced that 2021 is a good year for the CPU market, unless it comes to people who specifically are working with CPU productivity based tasks.

This sounds like a nonsensical rant, but just my perspective on the current situation. Nvidia are leading in the GPU market, AMD are leading in the CPU market and Intel are trailing behind, essentially still selling 8th gen CPUs disguised as 10th gen at a more affordable price. But with AMD providing chips for both desktop as well as next gen gaming consoles, this is also something worth consideration, as manufacturing of AMDs architecture is in high demand.

2124,GM," I think Conti NA is deep in the pants with GM, they make the telematics units behind GMs OnStar infotainment, and i believe the electric powertrain behind the well-received chevy Bolt was co-developed with Conti.
