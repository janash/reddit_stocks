0,USA," I was an international trader for more than 8 years, all around the world, based in Europe. Even when you are using just 2 currencies (buying in USD selling in EUR) you are betting one way or another since exchange rates are moving.  So how fun would it be with BTC??

1. Change my 1 million USD to BTC, got 20.8 BTC
2. Buying stock from USA with prepayment, for 20.8 BTC
3. Selling the stock after it arrives for 10.4 BTC (because USD/BTC gone up)
4. Getting paid 30 days later, when the 10.4 BTC  worth 800 000 USD

Until the currency is useless for anything else (paying taxes and people) it will be useless for international trading. Every trade would be just a currency gamble.",Xetoros,37,/r/investing/comments/lv77hg/bitcoin_could_become_the_currency_of_choice_for/gpasnvh/,0.046,0.912,0.042,-0.1234

How hard is it to grasp, both sides get to pay with their native currency when they buy the agreed upon amount of Bitcoin. Once the transaction is mined it has been through the decentralised Bitcoin network where no nation state can reverse it. 

That's the part they are talking about, the USA or any other country with power can no longer force a third party state to withold another states funds.

I’m just an idiot that has been following btc for a number of years now, but fundamentally bitcoin sucks. Other cryptos have much better underlying tech. People are starting to wrap Bitcoin in ethereum now just to be able to actually do things with it.

If you want to buy Bitcoin because number goes up and to the right, that’s cool, but I still think Bitcoin’s price simply reflects a whole bunch of unregulated shit and fraud pumping the price up and a bunch of regular people and now institutions fomoing in thinking they’re getting in on the ground floor of the next industrial revolution.

Also, bitcoin isn't a Paypal competitor running on the internet. 

It's a digital switchboard replacing the analog one Paypal/Visa/etc currently plug into (ie SWIFT).

Also, idle electronics in the USA account for a ridiculous amount of energy use.

""The Natural Resources Defense Council partnered with Home Energy Analytics and the Stanford Sustainable Systems Lab to assess the impact of the growing cohort of always-on devices on consumer utility bills.

""always-on"" electricity use by inactive devices represents on average nearly 23 percent of northern California household electricity consumption.

if all homes in the United States reduced their always-on load for inactive devices to the level that a quarter of the homes in our study already achieve, it would:

* save consumers $8 billion on their annual utility bills,
* avoid 64 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity use per year, and
* prevent 44 million metric tons of carbon dioxide pollution, or 4.6 percent of U.S. residential sector carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from electricity generation.""

To imply they need to pump false articles due to BTC bring down 20% is foolish.  They understood the risk from the day they put their order in.

28,ETH," You clearly understand nothing about blockchain security if you think BTC is ""the most secure by design"". Would you like to explain how you're coming to that conclusion? 

BTC is secured by Proof of work (aka mining). PoW makes it computationally infeasible for an attacker to create fake transactions or to spend the same BTC twice without controlling 51% of the global computing power. Right now ETH and other currencies use PoW too and are thus no less secure by design.

Currencies like ETH are moving to Proof of Stake currently. It's generally agreed to be more secure than Proof of Work because Proof of Work is dominated by highly specialized computing equipment (ASICs) that consolidates mining power to groups/companies that can afford to buy this specialized hardware in bulk and run data centers large enough to power them all. This makes it easier for one group to acquire the majority of computing power because not many other groups are able to compete to acquire ASICS.

Proof of Stake doesn't require heavy computing and instead requires people to put in their crypto as collateral so that they need to acquire 51% of the money supply to attack. Additionally any malicious activity the staked commits is met with a heavy financial penalty. This means that any attack on the network will devalue one's own currency meaning an attacker loses their incentive to attack for profit. Proof of Stake also lowers the barrier of entry because instead of needing special ASICs, the requirement is to have a certain amount of capital which is easier for most people to accomplish.",XysterU,4,/r/investing/comments/lv77hg/bitcoin_could_become_the_currency_of_choice_for/gpc0zkg/,0.104,0.759,0.137,0.8078

Market movements sympathise with $CTRM with a ridiculously lower market cap and short float down from 33.73% to 10.62%.

PotlatchDeltic Corp. operates as a real estate investment trust. It engages in the ownership and management of acres of timberlands. It operates through the following segments: Timberlands, Wood Products and Real Estate.

Key Highlights:  
1. P/E is 20.55. Other lumber stocks such as BCC, LPX, and RFP range from 8-13 for their p/e ratios.  
2. Predicted trends for 2021 include increased home buying especially as we come out of the worst of the pandemic. Wood products are absolutely NECESSARY for home building. According to their IR presentation, they have a pretty steady hold on their markets especially in Idaho, it seems.   
3. Other retail sales are also expected to go up and lumber is used for many other general retail products too (i.e. paper, bulletin boards, packaging, furniture)

61,DD," Hi guys, I just want to put my DD on Sony out there, and would just like to know any critiques or any comments you may have, and if it's good enough to post. Also if you do downvote it tell me why so I know what I can improve, thanks.
       Sony (SNE) DD. First, their image and sensing division. Currently, Sony has a staggering 53.5% share of the image sensor market with Samsung being in second with only 18.1%. Why do image sensors matter so much, well, image sensors are key for cameras, medical imaging equipment, security and surveillance, ai and robotics, barcode readers, phones (your phone will have Sony parts unless it's a Samsung) and most lucrative of them all, autonomous vehicles.This currently brings in 26% of Sony's revenue, at a 13.5% margin.                                
 
Next is Sony music, the biggest music publisher in the world. They have some of the biggest names in the industry, with artists like Ed Sheeran, 21 savage, childish gambino, DJ Khalid and more. And as music streaming grows (with Spotify reporting 29% year over year growth, and tencent music  70%), Sony will be in a great position to dish out music from its signed artists. Music makes up 16% of Sony's revenue at a margin of 20%.( I will talk more about ""other "" at the end of the DD, but just so you know, other is grouped into music).                                  

Next is playstation. Sony has managed to do something quite brilliant with playstation, they have managed a transition from physical games to digital games, why does that matter, well, digital games gives sony higher margins. But the most exciting aspect of playstation is ps plus, ps plus has went from only 4m subscribers back 6-7 years ago, to having 48m subscribers, more than HBO max, and actually, ps plus now has a bigger operating profit than Netflix, whilst Netflix had 2x the market cap of the entire Sony business. And that number of ps plus subscribers is only set to grow, with gaming being the fastest growing aspect of entertainment. It is also likely that we will give our children PlayStation's, who will in turn give their kids kids PlayStation, like how whole families come together to watch the Simpsons. You may be thinking of their competitor, Xbox, but Xbox has only really solidified in North America and western Europe, with Sony significantly beating them Asian market. Revenue 26%, operating margin 13%.                                           

Next is Sony pictures, a company you may be familiar with, they have made everything from the smurfs, Spiderman and the shark tank. You may know of the ongoing streaming war, and one of my favourite quotes is don't make wars, provide ammo, which is exactly what Sony is doing. You may not know but Netflix don't actually produce their exclusives, they out source it, and one of the studios they outsource it to is Sony, Sony has made quite a hit for Netflix, The crown, with a reported 73 million households watching it. But Sony pictures doesn't just do work for Netflix, they also have done Alex Rider, a prime exclusive and Greyhound, an apple TV exclusive. Sony pictures brought in 8% of revenue at a 9.6% margin.           

Next is Sony electronics, who make things from headphones, televisions and their world renowned camera's, there are countless videos on YouTube, of people positively speaking of their switch of Nixon to Sony, showing a high brand loyalty in the photography market. 10% of revenue at a 6.6% margin. 

Next is financial services, I can't comment too much on them, as I didn't research them thoroughly, but I can say that their revenue is  10% at a 10.6% margin. 

Now I will discuss other. So first up is Sony's quiet move into monopolising anime, the second fastest growing aspect of entertainment, they have acquired crunchy roll, funimaton, aniplex and more. This means that if will be very hard for other streaming services to compete with Sony's anime, like how it was hard to compete with Netflix. A another quote from my favourite business book is be best or be first, and Sony are doing both in the anime market.                                                                               
 
Next is Sony's car, I feel it's a marketing stunt to show off and advertise their parts to other automakers, but it really shows what Sony is capable of, with Sony audio in the car, sony image sensors, Sony infotainment and more. 

Lastly is their mobile game, I again can't comment too much on it but it is very popular in Asia and brings in 1 billon in revenue, any questions feel free to ask.",notA_cringeyusername,2,/r/investing/comments/lv5e80/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gpc1ym9/,0.021,0.865,0.114,0.9968

64,AAPL," By what mechanism does the performance of a company increase/decrease the value of a stock?

So what I find easy to understand is if you bought a share of a company, at the end of the year the company sets aside a pot of money and divides it up amongst its shareholders. Next year people notice the pot growing bigger so the value of the share goes up as its likely to grant you a slice of a now bigger pie. I think this is somewhat how dividends work? I also see how a company buying the company that your share belongs to may require them to buy your share.

Regular stocks I don't really understand. How does the TSLA or AAPL pot get given to the investors, or converted into stock value? Do they have a ritual where they burn the pot? 


I probably will have follow-up questions, thanks in advance.

71,CEO," Tried posting this 

There's a new car in town: LUCID AIR 

They have proven technology and scaling up.

12 EV companies already have or are in the process of SPAC 

Lucid (CCIV) is the only EV SPAC with production facility and producing an actual car that Peter Rawlinson drives . Also the biggest SPAC ever in $$.

Factory in Arizona will have capacity for 400K vehicles per year, up from the current 34K.

They already have reservations to deliver in the summer!

Peter Rawlinson from Tesla Model S is Lucid's CEO 

I just bought some shares taking advantage that price was down almost 50% from high of $58 10 days ago.

79,AAPL," Financial assets like stocks and bonds are traditionally valued for their future cashflows discounted to present value (DCF). By that I mean, if you expect the company to grow their pot by $100 in 2031, you might value that contribution as $100/(1+*r*)^10yrs where the discount rate *r* incorporates your preference for money today over money tomorrow plus your preference for more certain payoffs to ones that are risky (particularly when the whole economy is doing poorly and your other financial assets are also doing poorly). You add up all the future cashflows, discounting each, and that's what it's worth to you today.  

We can abstract away the form that the company will pay out that pot to shareholders by assuming that if it keeps the money inside the company, it will use it to generate more value in the future at the same rate as our discount rate. They can pay it out now or keep investing it internally and it's essentially the same to us. If that assumption doesn't work, because management can't be trusted to use the money well or some other reason, then you'll need to account for that in your valuation.  

A company like TLSA isn't making much profit right now, but you might expect them to keep growing rapidly and make much more profit in the future. So you take that into account when valuing the stock.  

A company like AAPL is making a ton  of profit already and returning that to shareholders in the form of a dividends and buybacks (where AAPL uses its excess cash to buy shares of itself on the market and retires them so that remaining shareholders now own a larger fraction of the company).  

If you do some DCF calculations of what you think a company might be worth and find that it's worth more than the market is pricing it at, you will be eager to buy it. That means more demand for the shares which pushes the price up. If something bad happens that affects your valuation, you would be inclined to sell it until the price drops to reflect that problem. One thing to note here is that if something officially happens to the company which was already anticipated, that won't really change anything. It was already accounted for in your valuation. So for example, TSLA's current price already assumes a significant amount of future growth. Merely meeting those high growth expectations would not cause the stock to rise much more.",kiwimancy,2,/r/investing/comments/lv5e80/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gpcb80n/,0.054,0.836,0.11,0.9539

But they do have the data, so the point is moot.

Even if that's true (it's not), a computer program can literally be worth billions. This ""it's software so it's worth nothing"" argument sounds like something from the 1970s lol.

If it's actually worth zero it also means it would literally cost zero to reproduce the entire AirBnb (business + technology).

124,QS," The ideal investment scenario is to let winners run and cut your losses short.  Taking profits, like many investment decisions, is tough to be accurate with.  In some cases, you can tell that the run is extended beyond reason and selling all or part of your position is prudent in that scenario.  The problem is, ""How do you make that decision?""  The other problem you then have, assuming the outlook for the company hasn't changed, is when to get back in.  Quantumscape is an example of a stock I'd like to own as I believe in what they are doing and the leadership team.  I bought in when it was a SPAC, and rode it up to $63 when I decided that the run was extended and sold off my position.  It continued up to almost double that at $132.  Since then it has come back down to the mid-$50s.  If I buy in now at $57 I really only gained $6/share in lower basis, yet created a taxable event to get out early that is easily that much versus holding long-term.  So now I'm on the sidelines trying to time in a good entry, one that may never come.  If you truly want to own a 10x bagger type stock, keep in mind you have to hold it through that entire time.

126,CCIV," You should view most stocks as long term holds on companies you expect to continue to do well or grow a lot, but that doesn't mean you don't take obvious wins when they're staring you right in the face.

CCIV and GME are two cases of this. Even if you think both stocks will be worth triple digits in 3-5 years, you get out when it hits so high that you are getting 5-10x your return in a month or two.

Now if you invested in a company that had a major breakthrough and jumped 30% in a week then maybe it can sustain itself at that new level and you hold. If you're at month 10 maybe you continue to hold, but if you got in today and tomorrow the stock is worth triple and you don't think it stays at that level for in the short term then sell and wait for the pullback.

132,IMO," Strong disagree. And citing an anecdotal example is hardly proof. There are no hard and fast rules, but you always need to consider your individual situation and manage your risk, considering current information and how that shapes our expectations of the potential upside and downside. 

E.g. if a stock rockets up 100% in a week, and you can discern *no clear reason* for this to be the case, then you are a fool not to take profits, as the stock is very likely to come back down (i.e. you're in a risky spot and you need to minimize risk). On the other hand, if a stock rockets up 100% because it's a small cap pharma stock that just invented a new covid vaccine, then you hold because that's probably a real value increase. 

Those are extreme situations, but it works the same in practice just on a more nuanced scale. Like, if an asset class is rallying, it makes sense to hold on. But if it's rallying far beyond the level you think is sane, it's sensible to redistribute your portfolio out of this asset to manage downside risk. 

The reason why is because not losing money is as important as making making money. It is true that scared money doesn't make money. But understanding when a stock is at risk to tank is as important as when the stock has the potential to go up. You should act on both! You should be biased to try to make money, because the game only works if you make money, not just constantly avoiding losing. But the idea of scared money is just to guard against being too sensitive and letting normal market fluctuations push you out of a position pre-maturely.

Very minimal downside and if they get a target over the course of one year that is somewhat decent, that money you invested will likely beat the major indexes. Good targets (or even rumors) can see a 40-60% jump. At which point you can sell if you don’t like the target.

AMZN es an example is a global powerhouse NOW. everybody knows them right now. that does not mean everybody will keep knowing AMZN in the future or keep them in as high regard as people are doing now. 

lets take a look at them: they are known to be a good investment and a money printer. thats the good sentiment and lots of people lie them for this. 

then there´s people respectig AMZN and especially Bezos for making it what it is today.

yet a totally different angle would be: they built their wealth and success out of burutal working conditions, market manipulations and suppressing amazon partners and tax evasion. one only has to google 5 minutes to find out how exactly they are making sure not to lose any dollar if they can prevent it. 

on top of that, an evershifting portion of their revenue is generated by their AWS services, which is not exactly eco friendly. 

right now, in our current political and social climate, the general consensus still seems to be AMZN is pretty cool. great end consumer products, great service, yadda yadda. but I can also think of several factors shifting ever more to the other spectrum and mor and more people not wanting anything to do with such a global powerhouse.

AMZN es an example is a global powerhouse NOW. everybody knows them right now. that does not mean everybody will keep knowing AMZN in the future or keep them in as high regard as people are doing now. 

lets take a look at them: they are known to be a good investment and a money printer. thats the good sentiment and lots of people lie them for this. 

then there´s people respectig AMZN and especially Bezos for making it what it is today.

yet a totally different angle would be: they built their wealth and success out of burutal working conditions, market manipulations and suppressing amazon partners and tax evasion. one only has to google 5 minutes to find out how exactly they are making sure not to lose any dollar if they can prevent it. 

on top of that, an evershifting portion of their revenue is generated by their AWS services, which is not exactly eco friendly. 

right now, in our current political and social climate, the general consensus still seems to be AMZN is pretty cool. great end consumer products, great service, yadda yadda. but I can also think of several factors shifting ever more to the other spectrum and mor and more people not wanting anything to do with such a global powerhouse.

174,GME," Curious how people invest on regularly scheduled intervals on platforms like Fidelity.

Background, I jumped on M1 about a year ago. I liked the ideas of pies and being able to create pies within pies and weighting them however you liked. I also really liked the auto fund feature where I can have a transfer scheduled every week that then gets distributed into all my slices based on percentage.

A couple weeks ago, I opened a Fidelity account to get access to more ETFs that weren't available on M1, and to have a more traditional brokerage account. I set up a monthly transfer of $100, after an initial deposit of $5k (which I used to buy an initial set of ETFs), and today was the first auto deposit. Just curious how people typically invest these auto deposits.

Once I have my portfolio set up the way I intend to keep it for the long term, I'd love if I could set up an auto-invest. But I also don't love the idea of partial shares after some of the stuff that went down with GME. Granted that was a unique situation, but I'd like to have ultimate freedom and if I'm constantly buying partial shares, that may be hampered.

Is my only choice to either wait until I can buy a full share of whatever I want to add or increase my deposit amount (or increase the frequency)?",cjohns716,2,/r/investing/comments/lv5dl5/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gpb9esi/,0.0,0.823,0.177,0.9878
175,GME," Hi everyone!   


So, much like a lot of people, I started getting involved with stock trading in January. I fell for the hype, lost some money with GME, and that's when I started reading. After learning some more and doing more research (all of which I now know I should've done before ever opening a brokerage account.) I wound up making everything back that I'd lost with GME (and even a small profit) and decided that I didn't want to ""gamble"" anymore, so much as invest for the future.   


So hi! I guess the point of my post is that I'm very new to investing and am obviously not too smart a guy. Hell, I'm actually terrible with math. That hasn't kept me from being super interested though.   


Is it wise for someone like me to continue pursuing investing? I've had so much fun with it already, but don't know how long my luck will go for.

185,RKDA," Here i go! Im new into this, hope I'm not doing something wrong.

I've been a few months reading a lot and learning things about trading. I've been a while with paper trading and I felt I wasn't taking it serious enough. Last week, I put 1.800$ (still have other 4.000$ saved in my bank account) into a broker account. I've been a week already and it feels like I'm not on a good spot. I don't know which is the best way to keep going without smashing my bank account. 

&#x200B;

As I work 9/5 I think, swing trading suits me better than other styles, coz I'm quite busy and could only have 1-2h/day for trading and it would be at night time, mostly closed markets. I don't know if I'm going the right way. My plan was to start Stocks/Penny stocks and then put a bit into FX. After those, the plan was to move to an US broker and start with options too. Am I doing right? Which steps would u recommend?

I really appreciate the help, thanks!

190,HUGE," Hello Everyone,

I've been getting more and more into the stocks these past two years and decided to become a more informed investor. Started to read 10-K reports for companies that I hold, but I had a question regarding PLTR's employee stock-based compensation.

When looking into the cost of revenue from 2019 -> 2020, there is a HUGE increase in their cost which PLTR attributes to stock compensation. We even see that PLTR operated at a loss due to these stock-based compensations (per their 10-k report), "" In the year ended December 31, 2020, we **incurred losses** from operations of **$1.2 billion**, or income from operations of $189.9 million when excluding stock-based compensation"". Then total operating expenses is $1,913,805, is this without the employee compensation? 

I read through the 10-K report, but can't seem to find the answer. Are these employee stock compensations 1-time costs due to the listing earlier in September 2020? Or will these compensation programs continue to grow (which seems concerning since their revenue is only 1.08 billion).

Also, what tips would you recommend reviewing when reading a 10-K report? I read an overview of the company and their products offered. Now trying to read through these tables for their contribution margin. Anywhere else I should focus on within these reports?

200,SEAS," I started investing October 2019 but I still consider myself very new to this all (21yo American student, ~26k/year, hourly so + or - ~3k) I'm looking to find a mix of long term super safe investments (like 10-20 years) But I also am willing to put a hundred dollars or so into riskier short term stuff every now and then. 
My portfolio is 
>* 11 AMC @ $8.98
>* 11 PLUG @ $51.69
>* 10 MRO @ $11.40
>* 6 GPRO @ $8.11
>* 1 CPE @ $27.14

201,AAPL," I'm a Canadian in my mid twenties pretty new to investing. My home financial situation is pretty stable. I'm looking for stocks/ETFs to hold on to for about 5-15 years. Hopefully to help pay for a down payment on a home. I'm looking for something relatively low risk that I can put a couple hundred bucks into each month. I've got a list of tickers that interest me. I was hoping someone could help me narrow down which ones are the most practical:

204,RKT," i never traded dividends so im not sure how this stuff works but i saw RKT had a special dividend for $1 roughly and share price is roughly $24 so its about 4% plus or minus .5%

i know i need to buy by 3/9 but when exactly can i sell and still get the dividend. i read two different things. some said i can sell Monday and some said i need to wait until 3/23 to get paid. its a two week wait or a weekend wait but either way 4% is pretty neat return for a short period time hold. yes there is a sell off risk hence i want to know when i can sell so i don't hold when not necessary

Lucid (CCIV) is the only EV SPAC with production facility and producing an actual car that Peter Rawlinson drives . Also the biggest SPAC ever in $$.

Factory in Arizona will have capacity for 400K vehicles per year, up from the current 34K.

They already have reservations to deliver in the summer!

Peter Rawlinson from Tesla Model S is Lucid's CEO

219,SQ," First off, thanks for this response. Your example is super easy to digest. If only you wrote my text books lol. 
I'm not as much worried about the cost per share but your example of TQQQ's potential loss under the same circumstances where QQQ does not is great. 
Right now the portfolio isn't the hottest. Almost all Tech and a huge chunk is SQ (since I only have 1k in right now). Its been a good learning experience playing with the few stocks I have, but for longevity purposes I figure I should have something less capable of dying in a fiery explosion. So I don't hate the idea of TQQQ considering I'd be willing to risk that simulated 1.43% loss. Do you think it wise to use both so your funds would have a level of risk between the two.

EDIT: Could it be wise to sit on QQQ for stability then invest in a leveraged fund if it the outlook looks good?

227,RNG," I think that future demand for RNG-electric semis is drastically undercounted. Because RNG trucks are net carbon negative, businesses that use them can reduce their carbon footprint even further than BEV or fuel cell trucks. Since many large corporations are pushing ESG measures, they can reach their goals with lower cost by choosing RNG.

Thus far, the limiting factor in RNG trucks has been their terrible power and torque. Hyliion solves this by using a gas generator to power an electric drivetrain. This makes them more powerful than diesel, yet more environmentally friendly than fuel cells and BEV solutions.",thats_your_name_dude,4,/r/investing/comments/lvftdt/hyliion_hyln_electric_semi_truck_maker_tesla/gpbvopj/,0.095,0.8,0.104,-0.0074
228,AT," I agree with the person above who said you should back test this.  Assume starting this with a stock in the year 2000, put in a pretend stop loss sell and limit buy.  See how often your stock triggers the sell and buy.  

I read your explanation,  but I still don't understand exactly what you're thinking.   Is it a sell AT your initial cost basis or a trailing stop loss?  If you set it at your initial cost basis,  after eight years of gains you may never hit it.  

A trailing stop loss may trigger a the bottom of an average dip and come back up before hitting your buy point forcing you to abandon it or buy back higher than you sold.  

Another risk is that the stock drops hard for a good reason and you don't want to buy it again.   Look at one of my mistakes Transocean (RIG) how much would your plan have helped?

229,TTM," Ultimately, what you are describing is trading.  As this is an investing sub, most of the responses here will push back on your ideas.  It is like going to a karate instructor to learn kung fu.  We believe karate is best.  However, realistically, kung fu masters are very formidable and sometimes better fighters in their own right.

I would recommend you start by looking at some successful traders and their strategies.  John Carter and his TTM Squeeze strategy is one example.  Again, I am an investor.  So, I have limited knowledge in this area.  However, your proposal looks very different to me then what I understand to be a successful trading strategy.  You should really research a lot of various trading strategies before getting started in any one of them.

In addition, and I think this is the most important part of my reply, you should watch a few videos of John Carter himself talking about his life and lifestyle and decide for yourself if you actually really want to be him.  That in itself is a very, very important thing.  Particularly, watch his accounts of his early learning days after he blew up one of his portfolios, lost nearly his entire net worth, and spends the day vomiting in each hole on a nearby golf course.  Now, he goes on to be one of the most successful traders in America and has a net worth I could only imagine having.

230,UNP," Liquidating all of your compounding assets is always the wrong answer. The only way this would work in your favor is if you could know with absolute certainty what will happen with your stocks in the future so that you could avoid all drawdowns.

Volatility is not a fine, but rather, it's a feature of being invested. Most compounding machines have volatility as a component of them. You cannot escape this component, no matter how fancy you want to get with your tactics. The financial graveyard is littered with corpses of people who have have been blown up trying to exploit complex strategies.

Exact timing based models rarely ever work and they aren't repeatable. If you're going to set hard parameters like ""If this drops to my cost basis, I sell, but then if it goes up or down 7%  from there, I buy back in"", I question why you wouldn't have just used that extra cash on hand (you're heavy cash at the moment) to make purchases either at +/- 7%.

If you don't believe in your investments then you should exit the position. A massive, broad drawdown event should not be the catalyst for you to sell everything. You have to be a good steward of your capital.

Based on your original post and subsequent replies in this thread, I really think that you should re-assess your risk profile. Your risk tolerance is likely a lot lower than you're leading on to in your comments, which is why you're trying to come up with a scheme that will protect you from drawdowns. Figure out how much you're willing to risk and then put the rest of your money in a savings account. 

Lastly, I would surmise that since you're up ""20-30%"" in some of your positions, that you haven't been invested very long. Many quality names (not just SPACs or meme stocks) are up 50-100%+ over the past 4 years; even things like the Union Pacific Railroad have gone up 3x times since 2016 ($100 invested in UNP is $300 as of today). The SPY is up 100% over the past 4 years.

In the case of GEO, the decision is made easier by the fact the equity story is simply fundamentally challenged due to contract losses, high leverage, a dividend that is all but guaranteed to be cut further if not eliminated in totality, recent dilution via a convertible note offering, and a looming 2024 maturity wall.

Whether private prisons violate ones' ethical codes or not, many on both sides will find agreement in passing on GEO's equity.",Ry-Fi,5,/r/investing/comments/lva520/geo_is_a_new_position_for_michael_burry/gpbeib4/,0.135,0.726,0.139,0.5668
242,LUMN," LUMN is a great company from a free cash flow perspective, but its equity story is severely hampered by its lack of revenue growth. Still a lot of legacy revenue rolling off and its fiber products are only growing at a modest pace (enterprise & iGam). It will take significant investment from the company to reverse these trends and even if it can, growth will again be offset by continued roll off of legacy voice lines. Their SMB segment is also very challenged revenue wise.

That said, LUMN generates a ton of free cash flow and can afford to continue investing ~$900MM a year in its network while also maintaining its dividend. It is ultimately a long term value play, not a short term ripper. In my opinion the Company will do sizable M&A to solve its revenue woes once it gets within flirting distance of its long-term leverage targets. It's got a great balance sheet and cash flow profile to leverage for this purpose. Management has done a masterful job managing their capital structure.",Ry-Fi,3,/r/investing/comments/lva520/geo_is_a_new_position_for_michael_burry/gpbc7x8/,0.064,0.732,0.204,0.9802
243,ICE," This sector falls under my research coverage for institutional investors, so I follow the space closely. I have been to multiple private and public facilities in person, spoken with management teams, spoken with inmates inside facilities as well as recently discharged ICE detainees. It's totally fine with me if folks don't like the industry -- your morality is your own and it's not my job to convince anyone what to think in that regard, but I know a thing or two about the space. Unfortunately I spend a lot of time talking to investors about how various media reports that pop up miss the mark in terms of accurately describing the sector -- as a well known example, the whole kids in cages saga and unaccompanied minors. The private prison space deals with neither, but they get lumped in with this bunch frequently. I'm not blindly bullish the sector as we need to be correct and accurate in our opinions and analysis of the space, not a blind cheerleader. We've been long the sector and short the sector at different times to the tunes of millions. Price is obviously an important factor and so depending on the situation and point in time we very well may have a bearish view on the space.",Ry-Fi,4,/r/investing/comments/lva520/geo_is_a_new_position_for_michael_burry/gpbm3js/,0.059,0.873,0.068,-0.0053

248,GEO," The EO only applies to the DOJ. ICE is the biggest user of private prisons which is under DHS, so it does not apply to all of the federal government. I would also be shocked if the US Marshals can effectively move way from private prisons in totality (although one contract has been canceled thus far @ CoreCivic). The Federal halfway house business is also highly unlikely to move away from private prisons despite the E.O (they were unable to move this business away back in 2016 under the Obama E.O.). There are just practical limitations that exist in terms of demand for beds by the government and the amount of capacity the government itself owns.

The BoP business, however, is certainly leaving GEO which is a material headwind for the stock.",Ry-Fi,1,/r/investing/comments/lva520/geo_is_a_new_position_for_michael_burry/gpbcetf/,0.028,0.932,0.04,0.3612

250,ICE," Winner winner. I deleted my other posts as I'm sick of the downvoting.  ICE is under department of homeland security. It's fascinating the Obama detention center and cxw.  Also all the federal stuff doesn't include states.

The feds aren't going to release a bunch of people most likely.  They also most likely won't build new buildings. Possible sales to government of facilities could be done.

But more importantly raising the costs of capital for some the market needs or wants leads to oversized returns.  That's how it works.  I like cxw at these prices.  I'm going to hold 5 years or to 20.  Whatever happens first.",thebirdman556,2,/r/investing/comments/lva520/geo_is_a_new_position_for_michael_burry/gpc1rmn/,0.049,0.794,0.157,0.9152
