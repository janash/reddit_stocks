FAQ Edit:

Q: Should I vote?

A: YES

Q: Why should I vote?

A: You should vote because naked short selling will cause issues with shares being used to vote more than once. One of the easiest ways to prove that there is duplicate voting is for vote counts to come back incorrectly. This would certainly be the case if everyone voted!

Q: How can I vote?

A: Your broker likely has a specific tab or interface for proxy voting materials in general, which is where you should find the GME vote. Many brokers will email you as well!

Q: What should I vote for?

A: Vote however you would like, but do know that the board unanimously suggests you vote ‚ÄúFOR‚Äù on all options.",PeopleCalledRomanes,870,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n5g278/vlad/gx1a9xd/,0.0,0.904,0.096,0.8645

37,GME," Welcome to the casino!

The GameStop saga is a long one, and a more recent development in this sub. You may not see a lot of posts about it anymore and that is because it sort of took over WSB for almost a couple months before being relegated to its own subreddit(s).

The GameStop (or GME) thesis has multiple angles, with the most important two being arguably the a) transformation and b) short squeeze. Personally, I find that the transformation thesis provides long-term strategy and growth, and the short squeeze thesis is just the cherry on top.

So why GameStop?

GameStop has traditionally been a brick-and-mortar retailer (you will see this said often, it‚Äôs a bit of a media buzzword), but as of last year this trajectory has been changing. As you can imagine, COVID wreaked havoc on GameStop and similarly physical-location based companies (see also AMC). This decline in sales led to a relatively grave outlook for the company‚Äôs physical locations, but gave rise to the opportunity for a business transformation (the transformation thesis). Particularly, Ryan Cohen, ex-CEO of Chewy.com invested into GameStop and became not only a large shareholder, but a voice for change in the company. Chewy.com was his previous commercial success in which he carved out a market for pet food in the e-commerce space by focusing on quality and customer satisfaction. This is the vision he and his colleagues have for the future of GameStop.

The short squeeze thesis comes about as a result of financial institutions betting against GameStop (short selling) by which they actually sell now and buy later, expecting the stock price to drop. If the stock were to reach 0, these short sellers would not have to purchase shares to cover what they sold. This fact, along with the perceived decline in the company (and the fact that the company had serious debts!) led the stock to become the most shorted major stock. At the time, the amount of short positions was reported as greater than the total number of issued shares by the company. This led to the first squeeze (not necessarily a short squeeze!) and was halted before crashing back down to Earth. After resting at around $40 for a while, GameStop is now back at around $160. Keep in mind most short positions would have been established at or below about $20!

There‚Äôs a lot more to be said and a lot that happened that may be important to cover but that is the general idea. Wall Street bet heavily against GME, and may see that come back to bite them.

It's actually a very interesting phenomenon because the centre right absolutely did not want brexit but the centre left did. So you had the ruling party pretending they wanted to leave and the opposition pretending they wanted to stay. Which resulted in pretty tepid attitudes on both sides, rather than the blood and thunder you might expect. 

The UK has not crashed (had triple recession but so did...everywhere) but will almost certainly be weakened, long term, unless they get into a firm economic and/or political alliance via CANZUK. Right now the UK is not significantly different to any other wealthy nation in that covid has loaded on colossal debt (look at the debt:GDP ratios) but inflation is crazy low so it's...ok? It's almost as if covid has ameliorated a lot of the issues brexit caused because everyone's getting whacked by increased commodity prices, luxury goods inflations/supply problems, heavy debt, massive welfare expenses and whole sale changes to society.

Also when you place a buy or sell limit order they will only execute it exactly where you put it at. In comparison Fidelity has on more than one occasion gotten me a better price because if they see it rising they'll sell for more, or dropping they'll buy for less.

304,IMO," Wow, that's pretty fucked, particularly the erroneous call notices.  

I've had them as my primary broker for over 25 years, and have consolidated everything under their roof (primary checking/savings, two IRAs, brokerage, algo trading account).  Never had any problems and definitely never felt anything was shady. 

I can totally get why your experience would shake your faith in their infrastructure, but that said, they're definitely not a fly-by-night operation that plays fast and loose with things the way Robinhood, or Webull, or any of the other startups would. I do wish they had more prompt customer service, though the handful of times I have had to contact them they've always answered or fixed what I needed.

As for the missing cash, if you downgraded your account back to cash after only one day, then there's no way your prior trade had actually fully settled. In a margin account they float you the proceeds of a sale for the two days before settlement with other assets as collateral, and it's transparent to you, so it may look like you actually have settled. Free riding that float in a cash account by buying and then selling assets before the prior trade has actually T+2 settled is federally illegal and can get your account frozen for 3 months if it happens more than once. It's seems very likely that your sales combined with the account type changing during the settlement period has caused a delay in your money being added to your balance.

There's plenty of legit reasons to love or hate a broker, but I don't believe E\*Trade's a scam organization trying to screw over the little guy.

I do not believe this will continue going up. It's overvalued at this point and the short interest has dissipated.

CEO pulled the 500m share reserve proposal due to the dress down he got from shareholders (they said they will come back at this, I'm guessing for a smaller shelf size), but they are still going ahead and actively selling the 43m shares they got left these days.

I'm assuming those options expired and became worthless but honestly I wasn't paying attention or missed that. All I'm saying is there was two different entries of dollar amounts in the SEC Filing. The stock has been hovering around 3.7 where it was initially valued as a SPAC. The only way it moves is by showing positive growth for members, reinvesting revenue is expected, and there are many risks. This stock is no for sure thing but getting in at the ground level if it is also a possibility like any new company, coin, asset, etc. It's natural for people to doubt things until it gains credibility.",oneuponwallstreetz,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n57y6o/zach_upgraded_clov_rating_from_sell_to_hold_many/gx1ask7/,0.104,0.694,0.202,0.9612

546,DM," So, this isn't a zing at however many shares you can afford in the slightest, but 100 share round lots are a hell of a lot easier to dollar cost average down than 50 share purchases. Learn what a covered call is. Covered calls are way better than naked stock purchases for people looking to make some money without blowing up their account and reducing risk. $AMC still has a ton of IV/premium in it, so you can easily make that $5 gap back in a few months by selling slightly out-of-the-money calls.

It's very, very likely not going back to $14 though, so if you want to dig yourself out and make the money back, get yourself another 50 shares (which are already 50% off your original purchase, so you only need to climb back to $12ish via premiums) and start writing calls against it.

602,ADP," Futures are higher this morning, rebounding from the ‚ÄòYellen head-fake‚Äô that caused a bunch of selling yesterday afternoon. Small caps are leading the move higher, with the Russell 2000 up 0.7%. Nasdaq is up 0.6%. S&P and Dow up about 0.3%. Russell and Nasdaq also saw the brunt of the damage yesterday, giving up almost 2% each.

We do get to hear from a couple of FOMC members: Eric Rosengren, Loretta Mester, and Charles Evans. Not sure if they‚Äôre taking questions but if so you can bet they‚Äôll be asked about Yellen‚Äôs comments. 

My thoughts on Yellen and the Fed: Need to listen to the audio. Not gonna type it.

ADP payrolls are due out at 0815. Economists expecting 800k jobs added in April, quite a bit more than the 517k from March. We also get ISM services data at 10am. These are a couple of key reports where the health of the economy is concerned. As always, you need to watch for the Goldilocks scenario: too hot and it means inflation and Fed tightening. Too cold and the economy is not recovering quickly or strongly enough. Though nowadays, maybe the ‚Äòtoo cold‚Äô scenario is preferred.

832,SO," SO much to say on this.

I bought Peloton puts the first day the notice came out about the child that had a fatal accident on a Peloton. 

I am a pretty new investor and of course at the time I thought I was being a genius.

Just want some commentary or input so I don't make the same mistakes again...and also maybe some tips or advice on how to dampen this situation...

So basically on that first day, I bought over 20 put option contracts...but I chose the same expiration date for all of them.... which was 4/30.

&#x200B;

Literally today, 5 days later, Peloton falls 13%.

&#x200B;

As a brand new investor (opened my robinhood account in February) you can probably tell how frustrated I got...

836,ARE," One time, at the gym, I got on a treadmill. It was crowded and a spot opened up between these two ridiculously hot girls who were both jogging along at a slow pace. Seizing the opportunity like a boss, I got going at a slow running speed. 

I was at the peak of my fitness. I kept up that pace for quite a while which was pretty good for me since I wasn't usually a runner. Made it look easy. The women next to me and everyone else behind me were obviously impressed. 

Just when I was thinking about letting these two girls have a threesome with me, I tripped on my shoelace. One knee hit the belt, then the other, then before my hand could catch myself I went flying off the back and rolled on the floor into the treadmill behind me. Everyone laughed, but they were all just jealous. One of the girls shouted ""OH MY GOD!? ARE YOU OKAY!??"" then had to stop her treadmil because she was laughing so hard.

Thanks to my cat-like reflexes, I didn't break anything like a normal average human would have. I jumped right up, got back on the treadmill and said something like ""I'm fine, it happens all the time.""  The girl looked me up and down to admire my physique then said, ""You're bleeding.""  I looked down and sure enough I had scraped off the top layers of my knee caps. I said, ""Oh, I'll be alright.""

So then I got back on the treadmill in the coolest way possible and continued running. The other girl was laughing so hard that she had to stop too and walked away. Or maybe she was just intimidated by my quick recovery and inspiring display of resilience. I went for another couple of minutes until I could feel the blood running down my shins, then figured I'd better stop since I'm so considerate of others and the cleanliness of the facilities.",Tr47gRKl5,102,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n5i1vz/pelotons_stock_takes_a_dive_after_it_recalls/gx1x9t7/,0.063,0.765,0.172,0.9895

841,RKT," My guy, are you just randomly making up numbers?

Revenues to increase 50-100%? Ok, where‚Äôs that coming from, and that‚Äôs a pretty massive range. You think that within a year of selling used cars, they will match all of the revenue that they make on mortgages? Seems like that would require a metric fuck-ton of car sales.

Share price of $60-$70? So market cap 3-3.5x its current. Ok, where are those numbers coming from?

If you're an option holder, yes, because the IV crush will decimate your options. IV on these things is so nuts that the price went down *and calls went up*. But come Thursday morning, unless RKT goes vertical, these things will crater. Like, the pricetag on some of these things is so nuts that RKT practically has to hit 30 for a 25 to be profitable post-crush.

956,PM," I'm pretty interested in the earnings report as a new home buyer (closed Apr. 27).  The market is batshit insane in Denver, CO - for the house we closed on, we were the first people to view it - everything is going over ask by 20-30k with major repairs waived.

I think we viewed right around 46 houses and put down 4 offers.

Are you tuning into the earnings webcast? We ought get a live stream going for the tears or circle jerk.

What OP bought is just in the money contracts, which is less risky but the premium is high. So if RKT launches, he'll sell those 2 contracts for a higher premium than what he originally paid for them.

The prices of an option contract (calls/puts) is determine by their Greeks values. You can find many videos on youtube about this which will explain and go into details. Options is basically a giant math equation with multiple changing variables, one variable changes another and so the price fluctuate and all of the variables react different based on the option expiration date.

Oslo (TDN Direkt): Norwegian Air Shuttle announced on Monday the terms of the planned capital raising, which is up to NOK 6 billion. The capital raising will consist of you parts. An offer of new perpetual bonds with total gross proceeds of up to NOK 1,875 million, a rights issue with gross proceeds of up to NOK 395 million and a directed placement of new shares limited to an amount so that the total gross proceeds from the capital raising will not exceed NOK 6,000 million. The price of the rights issue and the private placement is set at NOK 6.26 per share. The company's total liabilities after completion of the restructuring proposal will be approximately NOK 16-18 billion, of which NOK 5.8-6.3 billion is airline-related debt. The company's cash balance (including cash with restrictions) after completion of the restructuring proposal is estimated to be approximately NOK 7 billion, based on the full amount in the capital raising being implemented. In the issue, shareholders will be allocated three subscription rights for every 2 existing shares registered at the end of 4 May. The subscription right is expected to be listed and negotiable on the Oslo Stock Exchange under the ticker code NAST from 7 May. The rights issue will consist of up to approximately 53 million shares at a price of NOK 6.26. In the private placement, Norwegian will offer up to 958 million shares, where the issue will consist of an institutional offer and an offer aimed at qualified creditors, as defined in the restructuring proposal. Several cornerstone investors have subscribed and will be allocated a total of NOK 2,855 million in the private placement. The investors are Geveran Trading, Sundt, Ludvig Lorentzen Med partnere, DNB Asset Management and Nordea Investment Management. After completion of the capital raising, assuming a maximum transaction size, the investors in the capital raising will own approximately 75.7 per cent of the company, unsecured creditors will own approximately 20.6 per cent through conversion of dividend claims and existing shareholders will own approximately 3.7 p.

1499,AB," No problem.  I've worked in this industry for about 10 years - on the environmental/by-product side of the business.  I remember driving down Highway 60 in Florida to Mosaic when their stock went bust - it was literally the day the cartel broke up.  Nutrien is the other player in the phosphate space.  They have phosphate plants in the northern part of Florida, North Carolina, along the Idaho/Wyoming border.

The other thing I will mention is that a couple of fairly sizable phosphate plants have closed since the industry tanked.  The PCS Nitrogen Plant City facility in Florida was purchased by Mosaic and subsequnetly closed due to poor profitability about 2 years ago.  The Nutrien/Agrium plant in Redwater, AB was switched to ammonium sulfate production about a year ago.  That may help your thesis as supply in North America has been reduced.  That said, the international component is a big piece of the puzzle and I cannot speak to that.

Down 18% is an understatement.
