12,DD," I listen to Cramer for his wisdom on the markets in general; he's smart that way, he's been in the business for a long time, and mentored by some of the most evil snakes in Goldman. I like the way he plays the game.

I don't care about his stock picks though except as general advice or figuring out an angle to play against. If you practice common sense, good DD skills, and risk management you can find the very same gems he can find, but you aren't gonna find them first by watching his show. He's there to get rubes onto the wheel.

While I didn't expect Didi to go down like it did,  Uber's business model sucks and you knew that, but went and bought the cheaper Chinese knockoff in spite of that!

Then he excelled in a way that exceeded even the highest of expectations, becoming probably the best hedge fund runner of the era and earning generational wealth at a very young age.

By rapidly assimilating and mastering the good and bad techniques of Wall Street, he absolutely dominated and made epically prescient calls through multiple cycles that many others missed.  Even post-wall street, Cramer has made some astounding calls, pounding the table on stocks like AAPL, NVDA, AMD, NFLX literally *years* before others. He was the one and only wild man screaming to sell ALL stocks months before the housing crash and Great Recession (a situation that was grossly misrepresented and has resurfaced in the form of misleading memes.). He flipped on TSLA, recommending it shortly before it went 20x.  He was also the one and only financial news voice screaming to sell stocks on COVID when literally nobody else was, even before it was called COVID.  He was mocked roundly as the market continued to melt up for a month and a half... and then crashed.  

But Cramer, through his narcissism, always fancied himself as more of a journalist, a crusader, a teacher.  He took his lifetime wealth and quit the game, betting instead on a news and information web platform right on the eve of the dot com implosion.  That scorched and humbled him.

Since then, he has voluntarily stayed out of the stock market himself, instead running a charitable trust that offsets the endowment income created by the wealth he earned previously.  

It's bizarrely ironic that today's young retail investors have been tricked into hating him.  He's truly just about the only wall street person alive who has actually been on their side, and he's the one person who has spent 20+ years not just paving the road for them, but creating the foundation for that road, and clearing away the trees and boulders and putting up all the lights and road signs.

30,RLX," Again, if you watched the actual segment, nearly a majority of the segment is dedicated to explaining the issues with Chinese stocks and IPOs. If you don't believe me, here are some of the many quotes said in the segment

>  
>""Of the 2020 deals, 10 out of 30 Chinese IPOs are down more than 40% from when they came public

Not even to mention how Cramer literally talks about other cases of Chinese frauds such as Luckin Coffee and Phoenix Tree Holdings, and IPO bombs like RLX Technologies. He's clearly stating that they are numerous risks with Chinese stocks as a whole, but he said that while there still is a lot of issues with investing in Chinese stocks, that doesn't mean you should discount them all. He details what is a pretty decent bull case for Didi, talking about their huge share of the Chinese ride-sharing market and how they trade at  a lower trading multiple than their competitors. He never acts like there isn't risk in Chinese companies as a whole, he literally spent more than half of the segment explaining why it's risky, but knowing what we knew at the time, he thoughts the pros outweighed the cons. Obviously it's not analyst level research but it's a quick rundown because they aren't going to spend all their time outlining a bull case.

I'm not a crazy huge fan of Cramer or anything, I have my own issues with him too, but I think it's ridiculous how out of context this post is, and it almost feels like no one here actually watched the segment and are just going off of the headline.",mithyyyy,1,/r/stocks/comments/og6sr1/cramer_telling_folks_get_as_many_didi_shares/h4h5abv/,0.061,0.844,0.095,0.894

Even in most recent years he’s touted the ‘cloud kings’ that I never took seriously. They have mostly gone up a lot. I like listening to him because I think he has a very good grasp on what the market is doing and how so many factors effect it.

33,NYT," I don't know that he is a ""genius savant"". He didn't ""buzzsaw"" through higher education. He did attend Harvard as an undergrad, graduating in four years (which is standard) with a bachelor's in government. He went back to Harvard a few years later, after spending time as a journalist in Florida and California, and worked briefly for Governor Jerry Brown before returning to Harvard Law School, graduating with a law degree.

As far as ""self-made""... that's a bit if a stretch. His father was not a ""paper bag salesman"". He owned a company, International Packaging Products, in Philadelphia. His company sold boxes and paper bags to businesses all throughout the the Philadelphia Metro area. His family paid for his undergrad degree. His stock picking paid for law school.

34,TV," I don't know that he is a ""genius savant"". He didn't ""buzzsaw"" through higher education. He did attend Harvard as an undergrad, graduating in four years (which is standard) with a bachelor's in government. He went back to Harvard a few years later, after spending time as a journalist in Florida and California, and worked briefly for Governor Jerry Brown before returning to Harvard Law School, graduating with a law degree.

As far as ""self-made""... that's a bit if a stretch. His father was not a ""paper bag salesman"". He owned a company, International Packaging Products, in Philadelphia. His company sold boxes and paper bags to businesses all throughout the the Philadelphia Metro area. His family paid for his undergrad degree. His stock picking paid for law school.

38,AMD," I'll just address the last part because the rest is subjective.  There's a handful of these analysis stories, which are greatly flawed.  First off, to be published, they have to be sensational, and thus to be sensationalized, methodology and objectivity must be ignored.  

Further, they falsely assume lightning round binary up/down calls as if those are Cramer's recommendation.  Why they choose that versus his actual recommendations, which are a hundred times more clear and elaborately laid out in detailed segments?  Easy.  Then they wouldn't have their sensational article, would they?  

Cramer's major and daily and repeated-a-thousand-times picks have been things like Salesforce, AMD, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, Tesla, Nvidia, Netflix.  And he made those calls ages before they were obvious, and he made them into the same shit storm of liars and critics that still exist.  

In every single one of his books and on every single episode, he is crystal clear that the stocks those deceptive ""expose"" articles maliciously choose as their measuring stick should make up only about 5-10% of any portfolio, and to never, ever, let them exceed 20%.  He's explained why thousands of times.  

Furthermore, see analyses are deliberately crippled with a false assumption that an investor would somehow actively make an impulse stock pick but would then turn instantly blind and passive, holding for some arbitrary analysis period, and then blindly sell to crystallize the losses that would be necessary for their article to achieve the necessary conclusion.  But nobody acts like that.  

When they snipe into say $DIDI at $14, who is to say they don't flip it at $18?  Or $16, where it was when he reversed position?  

Then along come people like you who skim the headline and satisfy yourself that his ""picks"" would have ""underperformed"".  

The other form of disinformation is when they take the charitable trust and pretend it represents Cramer's ""picks"".  They know full well that a charitable trust has different investment priorities and risk tolerances. They know full well it has a different fund manager and the Cramer is one person on a committee.  They know that the trust is locked out of transacting any security Cramer speaks about in public  (a standard which I'll point out that those writers, and redditors, and banks, and institutions themselves do not follow.)

45,TSLA," The problem is you keep picking examples that prove me right.  Cramer was right to subtly mock Cathie Wood.  She's a flake.  

Let's deep dive into just one of your examples: 

And he was very right to be skeptical of Tesla.  The founder is a psychopath and crook.  When Cramer (and I) were critical of Tesla, they were selling fewer cars in a year than the smallest automakers sell in a week.  They were bankrupt.  Every promise the founder made was broken, every boast he made was a lie.    

Then one day he told a really big lie.  With just a couple weeks before actual bankruptcy, he claimed he had taken the company private.  But not just that, he said he'd sold for the three times the current value.  And not just that, he said the funding was secured.  Not just a verbal deal.  Actual cash.  Secured.

At first blush it seemed ridiculous.  A known liar telling yet another lie.  But the problem is, if you doubt it, and you're wrong, you could be very badly burned.  Or if did believe it, you're getting a near instant 200% return in every dollar you throw at it, and every share you decline to sell.  

Would he really be committing what is essentially a massive felony in plain sight like that?  Turns out that yes, yes he was.  Our bizarrely inconsistent and selective enforcement is the only reason he's not in prison.

But it didn't matter.  The ensuing fraudulent confusion caused the stock price to illegitimately spike up, which caused more and more short covering, which caused more spiking.  Greed for the potential free 200% trucked in more money and bought more time.  He took advantage, converting the ill-gotten paper gains into ill-gotten real cash, over and over.  Soon, the deserved bankruptcy was staved off.  

The stolen money was pumped into factory building and production.  More grandiose and exaggerated promises were made.  Suddenly a few cars were being sold, and factories were supposedly nearing completion, at record speed.  Tesla, through a criminal process, had actually transformed from bankrupt to potentially viable.  

It was then, and *only* then, that Cramer flipped on TSLA.  At the equivalent of around $30/share.  And when doing so, he was clear this wasn't an endorsement of the founder's ethics, or his claims, but of the raw fact the stock was now going to rise.  And did it ever rise.  By at least 20x, depending on if and when you listened to Cramer.  I didn't, because no matter how good some opportunities look, I have standards.  I can't support naked fraud by the founder, even if it can pay me a few bucks.  

But to say that flip was an example of Cramer being bad?  You couldn't have picked a worse example.",Summebride,-1,/r/stocks/comments/og6sr1/cramer_telling_folks_get_as_many_didi_shares/h4hscv2/,0.148,0.733,0.119,-0.9304

Cramer said that holding your investments with bear Stearns is okay, and that they may actually be acquired. He was actually right on this call. All the videos you see are taken out of context.

Cramer is still an idiot, but he did NOT tell anyone to buy or hold bear Stearns at that time. He was simply saying if you have accounts with bear Stearns, their liquidity was not an issue and they were likely to be taken over. Which they were days later by JP Morgan.

87,DD," I’m pretty familiar with their business model.

Their unit economics are profitable. It’s the reinvestment into their company that makes them overall unprofitable. This is a good thing for a growth company.

It is not DD or any delivery service that marks up menu items. That is a decision made by the restaurant to try and erase the effect of commissions. Some restaurants do this intelligently and others don’t. 

Lastly, I know someone that works at a large chain restaurant that has a data science operation. Basically the in person clientele and delivery service clientele are not highly correlated. In simple English: even if DD commissions reduce the margin per order for the restaurants, it is still additive to the bottom line (if the pricing strategy is sensible) because that person would have been unlikely to come into the restaurant anyway.

There is a huge variance in the business competence of restaurants. Some are huge and use analytics and data science for pricing and decision making. Others are genuinely stupid business wise but serve good food. I’d take any restaurant owner’s word with a huge grain of salt. Double that for a Dasher - they don’t know what the fuck they’re talking about. Their entire judgement of the business is based on their paycheck. All the huge branded chains are on multiple delivery services. McDonald’s and Chipotle wouldn’t be on there if they were getting ripped off. (Obviously economies of scale play a role but the point stands)

Lastly, as a consumer, you’re paying for a service. Why would you not expect to pay for the convenience of getting food delivered to your door? And if DD is connecting new consumers and orders to a restaurant, why as a restaurant would you not expect to pay commissions to this middle man? If you eat at a restaurant you’re paying the wages of the waitstaff and chefs as well as tipping. That’s a markup over the price of just food also. 

I don’t particularly think food delivery is some great business due to a variety of risk factors and I don’t know if I’d bet on one single company in the space at current valuations but the analysis on this sub is fucking asinine.",aj1287,30,/r/stocks/comments/ofy1bk/doordash_stocks/h4g2q4z/,0.025,0.871,0.104,0.9756

102,TBC," About Tesla’s investment in crypto: yes, they have invested in a big amount of crypto, which is a risk and not good for the climate right now. Tesla didn’t realize this when they invested in bitcoin, but hey, you have also made mistakes. At least they cancelled to use Bitcoin for buying their cars until Bitcoin is more sustainable, energy wise.

In terms of Starlink: you’re wrong. If you head over to r/starlink you’ll see how people get much better and faster WiFi than they had before. Starlink doesn’t cover the whole earth yet, but as they keep launching satellites up, they’ll eventually cover most of the Earth. Musk recently said in an interview that Starlink will have global coverage by August (because Elon is Elon, it might happen a bit later.)

The Boring Company is not one of his primary projects and you’re right about what you say. I’ll have to say, that if he succeeds with making tunnels and make them cheaper, it’s actually not a stupid idea to convert traffic from 2D to 3D. If you want to know more about TBC and the tunnels, you can watch one of his interviews with Joe Rogan where Elon explains all of it.

You say Tesla’s are overpriced? Compared to which other electric car with equal tech, battery, software, efficiency, performance, and safety? About the catching fire thing: you’re clearly a victim of the fake news media’s FUD. According to [Tesla’s Vehicle Safety Report](https://www.tesla.com/vehiclesafetyreport) during 2012 to 2020, there’s been one Tesla vehicle on fire for every 205 million miles driven, compared to one vehicle fire in the US per 19 million miles driven. Make sure to know the facts mate.

Elon didn’t invent electric cars, and I have never implied that. But he certainly was the reason why electric cars is a rising market right now and the future. No one before Tesla was really trying to innovate or make great EV’s, and that’s why Tesla is the leading EV manufacturer today. If you haven’t slept under a rock, you would have known Tesla is developing a smaller, more cheaper electric car than what they offer right now. 

Again, say what you will about Elon, but you can’t deny he has done some really profound things.",PripDR,1,/r/stocks/comments/og97of/elon_going_full_xi_jinping_mode/h4icxwy/,0.096,0.781,0.123,0.9416
103,MSM," I am not making any claims. I am only stating facts.

The FED is the product of a conspiracy against the general public. If you understood what cartels, monopolies and captive markets are, you would see that the world is ruled by a mafia of oligarchs that started in earnest with the Petro-Chemical and banking cartels of Rockefeller and Rothschild. Oil is about power. Every aspect of modern life was shaped in its image. Petrodollars are a real conspiracy. I am a conspiracy realist while the MSM is now trying to talk about alien invasions.

""Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure — one world, if you will. If that is the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it."" -David Rockefeller, Memoirs",TencentInvestor,0,/r/stocks/comments/og97of/elon_going_full_xi_jinping_mode/h4hmlxc/,0.077,0.832,0.091,0.34
104,ON," There’s not enough US Treasuries to go around to be used as bank collateral. Banks deposits have been rising while loans have been falling / flat (demand for loans has been weak) leading to more liabilities on the sheets of the banks who need more regulatory capital. Debt has also been rising (so bank reserves with the FED have increased) and the debt ceiling is gonna come back into effect at the end of July. 

This has also not been helped by the removal of the relaxation of SLO requirements in March.

Consequently, companies on the advice of banks have been going to MMFs to reduce bank deposits, this has made their assets increase and they are now running out of Treasuries to purchase (MMFs buy Treasuries to stay low risk). This is also not helped by the FED’s QE program which buys $80bn in Treasuries every month, removing Treasuries from the system. 


So there’s a huge demand for Treasuries and a lack of supply of them, one way to get hold of them is through the FED’s Reverse Repo Facility which lends them out overnight. 

and this is why we have seen an EXPLOSION in overnight RRP reaching almost $1Tn at the end of June* and the FED’s minutes yesterday addressed a potential further increase of limits for participants, the limit had already been increased in March from $30bn per participant to $80bn. Also note that the short term Treasuries (eg 3 month) pay less than overnight RRP currently. 

Credit Suisse’s Zoltan “RepoLegend” has also warned of unexpected volatility in the market as it reaches the trillions this summer. 

*it usually spikes for quarter ends but it has not sharply dropped like usual. as of yesterday it was $785bn in ON RRP

As soon as any significant number of folks start getting skeptical, they pull out and the whole levered house of cards comes tumbling down.  Classic, classic bubble behavior.

I don't know if it was related to the jobless claims, which some big wigs may have had access to before they were released.

Low and middle income people who won’t use on line banking and come in every week to cash checks are not of value. You can see that in every thing they’re doing . For example, Bank of America will only let you recourse a check now if you have those funds in account. That happened about six months ago. I think they were the last bank to change. Being able to recourse a check and not have the funds was a low income attraction to banking there. Saved change is a low income thing. So are money orders. Those are for cheap people so broke they don’t have $40 for a check book. They don’t even want deposits anymore. Too much cash on hand right now.

You might be getting the “if purchased before this date” confused with the dividend payment and not the split. Whether or not to buy before or after the split is a debate that someone else will know a lot more about. I’ve heard it will spike as the lower price raises the value, then will drop immediately after as people sell to capture their profits. But that’s a whole lot of timing the market and if you’re looking for a long term hold just buy on the next red day you see. Hopefully someone who knows more will respond and really explain it but that’s what I can offer you.

So who the fuck would want to buy your 49% from you at market prices, knowing the LIMITED optionality. Therefore a HEAVY discount to NAV is required as a risk premium. Maybe the 51% would approve selling the gold one day, who knows? What would it take to make that bet? What if they never approve a sale. ITS DEAD MONEY.

I think that the fall in price has very little to do with some nefarious financial institutions though.

BTG dropped from above 5 to 4.5ish when gold fell from 1900 to 1775, this makes sense for a gold mining company. The fall from 4.50 to 4 happened right after they paid out a dividends, and as political issues surrounding a portion of their Mali mine started to look worse. This also makes sense.

Don't get me wrong, I think it's a fantastic time to buy, and I do expect the price to double or triple over the next couple years.

265,ATH, I see this sector as seriously at risk from increasing inflation and higher rates. ATH on anything screams sell to me.

266,GS," I debated this as well. Here are my thoughts...

SoFi is banking on gaining lifetime customers (members) through two concepts. The all-inclusive business model, as well as the feel-good ""we're here to help you"" model. Leading corporations have proven the all-inclusive model works well, and is always preferred by customers over the pick-and-choose products from different companies. Consolidation is key.

The feel-good model gains that customer loyalty, and entices customers to stick with SoFi when in the market for other services/products even if the price or rate is slightly higher. SoFi gives perks for using as many of their services as possible, and they have just about every single fin product you can think of.

&#x200B;

I look at them as a bank, insurance company, broker, advisor, and data company all wrapped in one. They operate as a bank but without the overhead of an institutional bank with physical locations. They provide insurance products, without acting as a scummy insurance company and I think most people hate dealing with insurance companies. They are a broker and provide all the benefits of other brokers, just shy of offering options (soon) and other advanced trading services. They have great money management services, advisors, and give the sense that they really do want to help people be more knowledgable and become financially independent. Lastly, they are utilizing tech to improve all of their current services, mobile app, etc. and are improving their revenue/margins with their technology acquisitions. Currently owning Galileo that powers some of their competitors like robinhood, as well as acquiring part of Apex Clearing.

&#x200B;

No, SoFi doesn't bring anything industry-changing to the table just yet, but is proving to wedge it's way into many financial industries that have had the same players for years. It's also proven to grow it's customer base significantly with the above models, and shows no signs of slowing down.

Lastly, I would say their strongest aspect by far is their upper management team. Anthony Noto CEO, coming from Goldman Sachs as lead underwriter for the Twitter IPO, CFO of Twitter, as well as CFO of the NFL. The rest of the team comes from roles in Uber, Amazon, Citi, Intuit, GS, Zynga, Toyota etc. I would check out their investor presentation for more info on this team.

343,NET," I sell covered calls and cash covered puts regularly. I’m usually 1-2 weeks out sometimes a month, very rarely longer.
It’s called Options Wheel strategy.

My two main goals are to take advantage of high IV and theta decay. I want to be directionally correct and pocket the premium, however what I’m selling is also strategic to my account….
If I’m looking to pick something up I may start selling ATM puts with a very short duration, or likewise if I’m overweight something I might sell calls to reduce holdings.

In some cases the strategy performs well, in others it can perform poorly. A recent example was selling some CC’s of NET @$100 when it was like $90. It had a huge run up and I think closed around $102 so they were exercised. It has continued to go up so it would have been better to hold, even after premium.
However, I’ve now started selling $98 strikes 2 weeks out to get the premium and if they drop and I rebuy then I’m good.

I’m at about 30% annual return for the last 2 years (realized gains).

Naturally that cash is reinvested into stock…

To answer your questions:
1) & 2) see above.
3) yea, buy to cover, you can do this to take profit or if you want to exit at a loss and not be exercised and/or roll the option 
4) many other reasons but see above as to why I do
5) depends on your broker. In most cases they won’t allow you to sell unless you have a options level 3 with margin or the available cash.
I wouldn’t worry about puts the most it’ll ever cost you is the cost of 100 shares… selling a naked call can have infinite loss",RunningJay,3,/r/stocks/comments/og9z1c/questions_about_selling_options_and_when_would/h4hnctb/,0.052,0.89,0.058,-0.34
344,DTE," To try and answer some of your questions:

1-  this really depends on you, the stock and your risk profile.  Many folks look at 30+ DTE and let theta go to work for them.

2-  Again there is no right or wrong answer.  You might do this if it is part of a overall strategy with other options.  If the contract expires in the money, it will be assigned.

3-  Yes and many folks do this all the time rather than waiting on the option to expire.  If you are under water on an option, you can always ‘roll’ it to a future date, often for a net credit.

4-  I often sell covered calls on stock I own.  It gives me a way of earning some extra return.  The key is to sell the call at a price you would be happy to sell the stock for.  I usually sell it at a price sufficiently out of the market such that assignment does not often happen.  If it does, is usually sell a put to eventually buy it back at a bit of a discount.

5-  I don’t do this, to much risk for my investment strategy.  I always make sure I have sufficient cash to cover the puts I sell.",SleepySuper,2,/r/stocks/comments/og9z1c/questions_about_selling_options_and_when_would/h4hl4yp/,0.045,0.9,0.054,0.4215
345,DD," Well, if you have been investing long enough then you should know that diversification is more than a word. You should also know that good stocks are good stocks. If you do your DD and buy companies that you like then why would you have to worry? Unless you think your companies are going out of business due to a correction...which is circular logic because that would mean that you did not do your DD. Doing good DD means that you accounted for a correction when you planned your portfolio. Trimming some investments and reinvesting a bit around a correction is certainly fine but that should not be more than about 10% of your portfolio. 

The simplest plan is to just buy more stocks while they are discounted in the companies that you already believe in and that you have already made long-term investment plans around. In other words, buy more of what you have. 

To answer your question.

If interest rate rise then banks are a good investment

346,IMO," The Delta variant could cause some panic but IMO there is almost zero chance the economy shuts down again now that a vaccine is available. Even with the studies that have shown some of the current vaccines aren’t as effective at preventing infection as they were with the first strain, there is still data that shows it’s 94% effective at preventing severe illness and death.
