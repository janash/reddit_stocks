The guy blatantly came out and said that a strategy he used was to manipulate reporters and journalists with 'rumors' to drive the price down or up to boost price action. His own words: ""You have to use these guys.""

WSJ posted a stock tracker with Cramer's stock. During a two-year span, Cramer's stocks underperformed the DOW and S&P 500. You would have done much better just ignoring Cramer and watched a sports game.

In 2008, a viewer called in and asked if Bear Stearns had a liquidity problem and if he should get his money out.

His response: ""No! No! No! Bear Stearns is fine. Do not take your money out. If there’s one takeaway, Bear Stearns is not in trouble. I mean, if anything, they’re more likely to be taken over. Don’t move your money from Bear. That’s just being silly. Don’t be silly.""

Stearns went from $63 to being sold to JP Morgan for $10 a week later.

You have some shills and Jim Cramer claiming he was referring to the consumer banking and not the actual stock. Okay, so why did [TheStreet.com](https://TheStreet.com) (founded by Jim Cramer) have Bear Stearns listed as a 'Buy' rating for $62 per share on that very same day the caller asked his question? Do you guys really buy this garbage of an excuse? I mean, Cramer was HUGE on banking stocks such as Lynch, Stanley, Lehman, and Stearns around that time.

The fact is, Cramer is a smart dude but he ain't your friend. The guy gets paid to market and promote. He helps his buddies move stock prices. Why do you think he has so much access to different CEO's? I mean, every single one of them come into his show acting like they are BBQ buddies. I mean, Cramer isn't allowed to trade stocks other than those related to CNBC. If he's as good as everyone is saying, who would give up the ability to trade stocks to work as a talkshow personality for investing?

11,DD," I listen to Cramer for his wisdom on the markets in general; he's smart that way, he's been in the business for a long time, and mentored by some of the most evil snakes in Goldman. I like the way he plays the game.

I don't care about his stock picks though except as general advice or figuring out an angle to play against. If you practice common sense, good DD skills, and risk management you can find the very same gems he can find, but you aren't gonna find them first by watching his show. He's there to get rubes onto the wheel.

While I didn't expect Didi to go down like it did,  Uber's business model sucks and you knew that, but went and bought the cheaper Chinese knockoff in spite of that! Don't blame Cramer for that one; if you took his advice for fast money you gotta remember the old adage: ""easy come, easy go.""",WhatnotSoforth,-1,/r/stocks/comments/og6sr1/cramer_telling_folks_get_as_many_didi_shares/h4h7bzq/,0.079,0.782,0.139,0.8265
12,DIS," I think it is more a problem with hindsight reporting in investing news. I can think of several examples over the years Jim Cramer has done but to pick a recent one take DIS.

It was going up he kept saying buy DIS and said it was perfect reopening play. It goes down and then says he sold out of the stock and called it a pandemic play.

18,AAPL," Cramer is a narcissist.  

But he's also a genius savant.  He buzzsawed through higher education in multiple hard disciplines, with grades that let him write his own golden ticket.  He ripped his way into a top position in what was the hottest division of the top financial firm on earth.  Then he excelled in a way that exceeded even the highest of expectations, becoming probably the best hedge fund runner of the era and earning generational wealth at a very young age.  People talk about ""self-made success"".  That was him.  His father was literally a paper bag salesman.  

By rapidly assimilating and mastering the good and bad techniques of Wall Street, he absolutely dominated and made epically prescient calls through multiple cycles that many others missed.  Even post-wall street, Cramer has made some astounding calls, pounding the table on stocks like AAPL, NVDA, AMD, NFLX literally *years* before others. He was the one and only wild man screaming to sell ALL stocks months before the housing crash and Great Recession (a situation that was grossly misrepresented and has resurfaced in the form of misleading memes.). He flipped on TSLA, recommending it shortly before it went 20x.  He was also the one and only financial news voice screaming to sell stocks on COVID when literally nobody else was, even before it was called COVID.  He was mocked roundly as the market continued to melt up for a month and a half... and then crashed.  

But Cramer, through his narcissism, always fancied himself as more of a journalist, a crusader, a teacher.  He took his lifetime wealth and quit the game, betting instead on a news and information web platform right on the eve of the dot com implosion.  That scorched and humbled him.

Since then, he has voluntarily stayed out of the stock market himself, instead running a charitable trust that offsets the endowment income created by the wealth he earned previously.  

It's bizarrely ironic that today's young retail investors have been tricked into hating him.  He's truly just about the only wall street person alive who has actually been on their side, and he's the one person who has spent 20+ years not just paving the road for them, but creating the foundation for that road, and clearing away the trees and boulders and putting up all the lights and road signs.

He's ill-tempered, undisciplined, and above all, a narcissist.  But to say he's not smart is one of the most wrong statements in human history.",Summebride,13,/r/stocks/comments/og6sr1/cramer_telling_folks_get_as_many_didi_shares/h4h4bf2/,0.099,0.768,0.134,0.9673

It's bizarrely ironic that today's young retail investors have been tricked into hating him.  He's truly just about the only wall street person alive who has actually been on their side, and he's the one person who has spent 20+ years not just paving the road for them, but creating the foundation for that road, and clearing away the trees and boulders and putting up all the lights and road signs.

He's ill-tempered, undisciplined, and above all, a narcissist.  But to say he's not smart is one of the most wrong statements in human history.",Summebride,13,/r/stocks/comments/og6sr1/cramer_telling_folks_get_as_many_didi_shares/h4h4bf2/,0.099,0.768,0.134,0.9673
24,BABA," If you actually watched Cramer instead of just believing the massive amount of circular disinformation on Reddit, you'd know that he was one of the first and loudest to warn retail investor against Chinese stocks.

At various times over the last year he maintain there were 1-3 flagship China stocks that could be held, BABA being the core of them.",Summebride,1,/r/stocks/comments/og6sr1/cramer_telling_folks_get_as_many_didi_shares/h4h1l5c/,0.019,0.962,0.019,0.0
25,RLX," Again, if you watched the actual segment, nearly a majority of the segment is dedicated to explaining the issues with Chinese stocks and IPOs. If you don't believe me, here are some of the many quotes said in the segment

>""We've got some real financial horror stories coming from China, though they pale in comparison to the human rights abuses.""  
>  
>""Of the 2020 deals, 10 out of 30 Chinese IPOs are down more than 40% from when they came public

Not even to mention how Cramer literally talks about other cases of Chinese frauds such as Luckin Coffee and Phoenix Tree Holdings, and IPO bombs like RLX Technologies. He's clearly stating that they are numerous risks with Chinese stocks as a whole, but he said that while there still is a lot of issues with investing in Chinese stocks, that doesn't mean you should discount them all. He details what is a pretty decent bull case for Didi, talking about their huge share of the Chinese ride-sharing market and how they trade at  a lower trading multiple than their competitors. He never acts like there isn't risk in Chinese companies as a whole, he literally spent more than half of the segment explaining why it's risky, but knowing what we knew at the time, he thoughts the pros outweighed the cons. Obviously it's not analyst level research but it's a quick rundown because they aren't going to spend all their time outlining a bull case.

I'm not a crazy huge fan of Cramer or anything, I have my own issues with him too, but I think it's ridiculous how out of context this post is, and it almost feels like no one here actually watched the segment and are just going off of the headline.",mithyyyy,1,/r/stocks/comments/og6sr1/cramer_telling_folks_get_as_many_didi_shares/h4h5abv/,0.061,0.844,0.095,0.894

30,AMD," I'll just address the last part because the rest is subjective.  There's a handful of these analysis stories, which are greatly flawed.  First off, to be published, they have to be sensational, and thus to be sensationalized, methodology and objectivity must be ignored.  

Further, they falsely assume lightning round binary up/down calls as if those are Cramer's recommendation.  Why they choose that versus his actual recommendations, which are a hundred times more clear and elaborately laid out in detailed segments?  Easy.  Then they wouldn't have their sensational article, would they?  

Cramer's major and daily and repeated-a-thousand-times picks have been things like Salesforce, AMD, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, Tesla, Nvidia, Netflix.  And he made those calls ages before they were obvious, and he made them into the same shit storm of liars and critics that still exist.  

In every single one of his books and on every single episode, he is crystal clear that the stocks those deceptive ""expose"" articles maliciously choose as their measuring stick should make up only about 5-10% of any portfolio, and to never, ever, let them exceed 20%.  He's explained why thousands of times.  

Furthermore, see analyses are deliberately crippled with a false assumption that an investor would somehow actively make an impulse stock pick but would then turn instantly blind and passive, holding for some arbitrary analysis period, and then blindly sell to crystallize the losses that would be necessary for their article to achieve the necessary conclusion.  But nobody acts like that.  

When they snipe into say $DIDI at $14, who is to say they don't flip it at $18?  Or $16, where it was when he reversed position?  

Then along come people like you who skim the headline and satisfy yourself that his ""picks"" would have ""underperformed"".  

The other form of disinformation is when they take the charitable trust and pretend it represents Cramer's ""picks"".  They know full well that a charitable trust has different investment priorities and risk tolerances. They know full well it has a different fund manager and the Cramer is one person on a committee.  They know that the trust is locked out of transacting any security Cramer speaks about in public  (a standard which I'll point out that those writers, and redditors, and banks, and institutions themselves do not follow.)

I usually avoid buying around IPO. Waiting and seeing how things go,let the dust settle.

Secondly, I always do research. I don't watch Cramer at all and from research I've done. While the idea of Chinas uber sounds appealing, I stayed away based off what I saw. I invested heavily into China. So perhaps I know where to find info better than others. Key info imo was already out because the Chinese government was already against the intial idea of Didi U.S IPO. 
But if that wasn't enough, the info online regarding the company not being profitable should have turned off most investors anyways.

61,DD," I’m pretty familiar with their business model.

Their unit economics are profitable. It’s the reinvestment into their company that makes them overall unprofitable. This is a good thing for a growth company.

It is not DD or any delivery service that marks up menu items. That is a decision made by the restaurant to try and erase the effect of commissions. Some restaurants do this intelligently and others don’t. 

Lastly, I know someone that works at a large chain restaurant that has a data science operation. Basically the in person clientele and delivery service clientele are not highly correlated. In simple English: even if DD commissions reduce the margin per order for the restaurants, it is still additive to the bottom line (if the pricing strategy is sensible) because that person would have been unlikely to come into the restaurant anyway.

There is a huge variance in the business competence of restaurants. Some are huge and use analytics and data science for pricing and decision making. Others are genuinely stupid business wise but serve good food. I’d take any restaurant owner’s word with a huge grain of salt. Double that for a Dasher - they don’t know what the fuck they’re talking about. Their entire judgement of the business is based on their paycheck. All the huge branded chains are on multiple delivery services. McDonald’s and Chipotle wouldn’t be on there if they were getting ripped off. (Obviously economies of scale play a role but the point stands)

Lastly, as a consumer, you’re paying for a service. Why would you not expect to pay for the convenience of getting food delivered to your door? And if DD is connecting new consumers and orders to a restaurant, why as a restaurant would you not expect to pay commissions to this middle man? If you eat at a restaurant you’re paying the wages of the waitstaff and chefs as well as tipping. That’s a markup over the price of just food also. 

I don’t particularly think food delivery is some great business due to a variety of risk factors and I don’t know if I’d bet on one single company in the space at current valuations but the analysis on this sub is fucking asinine.",aj1287,23,/r/stocks/comments/ofy1bk/doordash_stocks/h4g2q4z/,0.025,0.871,0.104,0.9756

75,AMD," Just fyi MU's products, DRAM, NAND are commodity products. Commodity anything are cyclical as they ramp up production when the expectation is that the economy will grow. This then leads to overproduction and ultimately low prices due to supply and demand. Take a look at the MU chart the past decade (or even longer) to get an idea of this. Granted, the memory industry is now an oligopoly, and some would argue we are in a multi-year up-cycle due to technological advances, so the cycles may be much more contained. 

I would advise looking more into the companies you listed. The fact that you list these stocks together kind of hints to me that you don't really understand them other than that they are in the semiconductor industry. I see many posts suggesting a stock because of how great their quarter and guidance are, but please remember the market is forward looking; chances are that great guidance is already priced in. 

In regards to your MU, TSM comment, just realize that there's probably a reason they are lower valued. My two cents for why they aren't trading at multiples like the others are: MU - commodity products as I mentioned in the first paragraph. As such, you can't expect them to trade at a growth premium like AMD since they don't control their price. DRAM by Micron is not better than DRAM by Samsung. People pick which to buy based on price. TSM - may be accounting for the political risk of China invading Taiwan. TSM is also an independent, pure-play foundry. Their entire capacity is already being utilized so you could say their growth is capped and already priced in. For them to grow more, they would have to increase capex and build more foundries. This takes months/years to complete.

TL;DR: Not saying MU, TSM can't rise more, but not for the argument you mentioned.

142,MU," This is the most informative reply on this question. For more information regarding the MU stock i would suggest you to watch this stock analysis by Sven Carlin. It really gives you an idea of how cyclical stocks work especially with commodity goods. MU might still be in the beginning cycle of another up cycle and with tailwinds such as 5G (5G devices require more DRAM and this is going to increase demand for DRAM with the 5G devices flooding the market) So Micron to me seems like a good bet at the moment. (I am long on MU btw) I bought in at $80 and am still holding because some value hedge fund managers have gotten into the share recently.

144,AMD," >It isn't about what chip is ""best"" it is about what you can get right now.

Actually it sort of is in datacenters. Every % improvement of performance per watt makes a huge difference when you have millions of machines. After Intels problems with performance and vulnerabilities, datacenters / cloud platforms learned that they need to diversify a bit and have rapidly introducing AMD based servers. 

While I do think Intel will fix their issues and is still valuable, in terms of pure growth, it seems like AMD has more potential as datacenters are diversifying to use more AMD. I guess the main risk is if AMD can keep up with demand.

156,NVDA," My understanding is that your ownership of NVDA will divide by 4 on the day of the split regardless of when you bought in. So say you buy at $812(for easy maths) you will get 4 shares at $203 in your portfolio at market open on the day of the split. That’s the message I got from my broker. You might be getting the “if purchased before this date” confused with the dividend payment and not the split. Whether or not to buy before or after the split is a debate that someone else will know a lot more about. I’ve heard it will spike as the lower price raises the value, then will drop immediately after as people sell to capture their profits. But that’s a whole lot of timing the market and if you’re looking for a long term hold just buy on the next red day you see. Hopefully someone who knows more will respond and really explain it but that’s what I can offer you.

160,ON," There’s not enough US Treasuries to go around to be used as bank collateral. Banks deposits have been rising while loans have been falling / flat (demand for loans has been weak) leading to more liabilities on the sheets of the banks who need more regulatory capital. Debt has also been rising (so bank reserves with the FED have increased) and the debt ceiling is gonna come back into effect at the end of July. 

This has also not been helped by the removal of the relaxation of SLO requirements in March.

Consequently, companies on the advice of banks have been going to MMFs to reduce bank deposits, this has made their assets increase and they are now running out of Treasuries to purchase (MMFs buy Treasuries to stay low risk). This is also not helped by the FED’s QE program which buys $80bn in Treasuries every month, removing Treasuries from the system. 


So there’s a huge demand for Treasuries and a lack of supply of them, one way to get hold of them is through the FED’s Reverse Repo Facility which lends them out overnight. 

and this is why we have seen an EXPLOSION in overnight RRP reaching almost $1Tn at the end of June* and the FED’s minutes yesterday addressed a potential further increase of limits for participants, the limit had already been increased in March from $30bn per participant to $80bn. Also note that the short term Treasuries (eg 3 month) pay less than overnight RRP currently. 

Credit Suisse’s Zoltan “RepoLegend” has also warned of unexpected volatility in the market as it reaches the trillions this summer.

228,IMO," Initial jobless claims rose unexpectedly, indicating IMO that despite the Fed going pedal-to-the-medal, their policies aren't having the impact they were hoping for.  Meanwhile housing prices and stock prices go up and up and up, well beyond fundamentals.  The markets have been on a hair trigger for the last few months, but as long as everything looks good and green then people ride the wave and nobody panics.

As soon as any significant number of folks start getting skeptical, they pull out and the whole levered house of cards comes tumbling down.  Classic, classic bubble behavior.

I don't know if it was related to the jobless claims, which some big wigs may have had access to before they were released.  But whatever it is, you're definitely seeing signs of nervousness and panic, and that's never a good thing for asset prices.

243,IMO," Oh, you're absolutely right that long-term it's a generally awesome play.  The only thing I would say is that just because the S+P 500 has done good since Buffet's time til now doesn't mean we'll have exact same run-up in the next 50 years.  The US was on the up-and-up then, now, if anything, it's kind of declining.  But you can diversify away some of that risk, and you most likely won't *lose* on it.

As for the second point, it's because with blue-chip defensive stocks and/or reliable businesses, you can reduce volatility on both the downside and upside.  So for someone who doesn't trust their ability to grin and bear it through 30-40% corrections, or who is bearish on the future of the economy, then reliable blue-chip businesses might be a better bet than index funds.

The part that stuck out to me the most was this idea that ""indexes do better in a correction"".  No, no they don't.  They do better than speculative stocks, yes.  But they also do much worse than blue-chip businesses.

Another point which I hadn't mentioned is that people view it as a one-size-fits-all solution.  I came into a lot of money this year, much more than I normally have to invest in my normal index fund for retirement.  People were adamant about lump-summing into index funds right now, and personally, no, I don't think it's a good idea.  Averaging in is fine, but the markets are IMO overvalued right now and I don't buy the ""you can't time the market"".  Also, my time horizon is not necessarily decades, I'm trying to save a little bit for the medium-term.  People seem to view that as sacrilege or something, but it's a known strategy for young people to go somewhat conservatively while one waits to see what their future is (perhaps a down payment on a house in the near future, a new car, etc.)",shortyafter,1,/r/stocks/comments/og3s35/rstocks_daily_discussion_options_trading_thursday/h4hbive/,0.075,0.805,0.119,0.9361

The 49% ownership stake is part of the equity structure and that will never change. So you the minority owner can not liquidate the gold, can not collateralize it, or loan it. Because the majority shareholder 51% calls the shots.

So who the fuck would want to buy your 49% from you at market prices, knowing the LIMITED optionality. Therefore a HEAVY discount to NAV is required as a risk premium. Maybe the 51% would approve selling the gold one day, who knows? What would it take to make that bet? What if they never approve a sale. ITS DEAD MONEY.

If you look at the release you'll notice 5900 of these openings are in the call center and claims organizations.  nearly all insurance carriers reduced their workforce in these areas last year during covid as there were no cars on the road.  All auto insurers are scrambling right now to hire up claims and call centers as accident frequency has picked up faster than many anticipated, therefore, there is TONS of movement in these two fields where seasoned claims professionals are changing companies.  This really isn't that huge of a deal in my view.

PGR is also going through a strategy shift from Mass market to preferred customers.  Over the past 5-10 years progressive has priced very competitively at low policy limits.  they're now shifting to be less competitive on low policy limits, but really targeting higher policy limit customers. The reason this is significant is their growth rate will likely slow, but margins will increase.  Think of any other good moving from mass production to high quality/ higher margin.  the move is tricky but progressive can pull it off.  I'm not entirely sure if it's the correct play or not.

401,IMO," The Delta variant could cause some panic but IMO there is almost zero chance the economy shuts down again now that a vaccine is available. Even with the studies that have shown some of the current vaccines aren’t as effective at preventing infection as they were with the first strain, there is still data that shows it’s 94% effective at preventing severe illness and death. With that, the onus is now on the people to protect themselves. This is specific to US stocks though because internationally, vaccine availability is still not great.",chrism-6,10,/r/stocks/comments/og7en8/why_are_most_stocks_on_the_nyse_falling_right_now/h4h231z/,0.195,0.685,0.12,-0.7723
