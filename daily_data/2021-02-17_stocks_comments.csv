93,PLTR," I thought this for a while too, but then I learned about rolling weekly calls. If you sell a call and it expires below the strike, you’re golden. But if it’s above the strike, on Friday before it exercises, you can buy it back and IMMEDIATELY sell the same call for the next week.

You will get cash premium for selling the call, which you are using to buy back the covered call you’re currently underwriting. If you pick the same strike price, you will always be making money off of the time/uncertainty between now and next Friday (#theta-gang).

There are methods to capitalize even on volatile stocks like Palantir in this way. Even if the share price flies, you can nudge your strike price up gradually by selling the call which lets you break-even when buying back the one for the current week.

Or you can even let the calls exercise, and use the profit from the sold shares to cover a put, so you potentially end up owning the shares again. This is the move if you think it’s rising too dramatically. And you can roll puts in the same way as calls, too. The best part is you’re always making premium along the way!

I basically just described The Wheel. It’s a great way to make consistent money, if your plan really is to hold PLTR super long-term. This might be a lot, it’s hard to put into few words, but once you get the hang of it it’s pretty cool!

Not necessarily. A ""pivot"" doesn't have to involve an extreme change in direction.  Apple is not currently an EV company, if they start producing EV's, then they most certainly have pivoted to some extent.

They still have plenty of market share to gain but are in a top position.

Furthermore they sell most of there loans within three weeks so their exposure to interest rate risk is not so big. I read their S1 filing and it sounds promising to me.

The reason why their net profit is so low currently (compared to previous years) is because there MSRs made 1b loss in fair value due to the low interest environment people are refinancing their mortgages and there repayment speed increases which leads to a decrease of the MSRs value. Furthermore they sell most of there loans within three weeks so their exposure to interest rate risk is not so big. I read their S1 filing and it sounds promising to me. They are significantly above average with important KPIs like customer satisfaction, customers are above average refinancing their mortgages from RKT through RKT and so on.

164,DD," I’ve learnt the hard way never to sell on a loss. Or at least try as hard as you can not to. If your DD and research leads you to believe in value of a company- hold for dear life. My only exception to this rule is a company that is _clearly_ on the road to no return. Bad earnings but solid company with long term recovery? Buy - hold. Good earnings but post earnings dip to key levels. Buy - hold. 

I’ve started putting my monthly investment money aside, made a list of companies I’d like to buy based on my own DD. Buy on a dip to levels I believe will hold or will not swing lower than. 

_Most of all_ I’m keeping money aside after buys to allow me to average down IF the price continues to fall. 

If there is value. If there is long term future for that company. It will rebound. Be it in a day. A month or a year. And you’ll be glad you averaged down. 

It’s easy to look and say “I wish I bought last week it was so cheap”. It’s harder to have the self control to say - I’ll wait on this one. It’ll be tough on red days or weeks but be glad you averaged down. 

If it raises past your price target - leave it till it settles down again.

Remember. If the market down is a whole. It’s not your stock picks specifically screwing you over. The entire market is moving.",JustLikeJD,1,/r/stocks/comments/llykgt/why_you_shouldnt_panic_about_todays_dip/gnt3zhj/,0.049,0.819,0.132,0.979

271,ETSY," I lost money in the markets for years before I turned things around.  I made all sorts of common mistakes, some of which you might find in your own practice:

1) Trying to get rich quick by focusing on short term trades

2) Selling way too early (see 1 above)

3) Keeping money on the sidelines because the market was due for a crash

4) Panic selling (which often resulted in selling at the bottom only to watch whatever I sold rebound soon after)

Things finally started to turn around for me when I shifted my focus and did the following:

1) Thinking long term - focus on investing rather than trading.  This alone will help you avoid some of the mistakes above.

2) Finding opportunities to take advantage of other people making the above mistakes.  For example, back in November of 2019 I was looking at ETSY as a potential investment.  It was trading around $60 at the time with earnings coming up, so I decided to wait and see.  The company disappointed on earnings and the stock sold off into the $40's, but I thought it was an overreaction so I was able to snatch up shares at around $43.  ETSY is now at $220+.  Another more recent example: remember when all the ""stay at home"" stocks sold off when the first good vaccine news came out last November?  I was able to pick up FVRR at a 20% discount, at around $140.  I just sold at $300+.

273,AAPL," You're definitely not the only one! I'm in the same boat as you. 

What's helped me is that I also have a savings account that is bigger than my brokerage account. So at least I know my bills will be paid for the next couple of months (from my income and savings) while I figure investing out. 

I've seen okay gains. I put 2.4k in and have since made $400 in a month of investing (this is after recouping GME losses lmfao). 

I've learned some lessons: don't panic sell/succumb to FOMO buying, maybe don't buy meme stocks, invest in a couple solid companies (like AAPL, FB, T, etc), pick a few good ETF's/ dividend stocks, and don't YOLO everything into penny stocks. 

Don't yolo all your money ever, keep a savings account to have liquid cash ready in case of emergency and invest responsibly. Just because tons of people on the internet are doing something, doesn't mean you should. Also you don't know if that mess is photoshopped! It's the internet! Those position posts could be completely fabricated for all we know! Gotta take those things with a grain of salt.

Also, you kind of have to have a solid stomach for risk/ loss. If you can't stomach seeing -$100 (or worse, -$730,000,) then maybe you should focus on retirement investing (like a Roth IRA or 401K if that's a possibility).

What's helped me is that I also have a savings account that is bigger than my brokerage account. So at least I know my bills will be paid for the next couple of months (from my income and savings) while I figure investing out. 

I've seen okay gains. I put 2.4k in and have since made $400 in a month of investing (this is after recouping GME losses lmfao). 

I've learned some lessons: don't panic sell/succumb to FOMO buying, maybe don't buy meme stocks, invest in a couple solid companies (like AAPL, FB, T, etc), pick a few good ETF's/ dividend stocks, and don't YOLO everything into penny stocks. 

Don't yolo all your money ever, keep a savings account to have liquid cash ready in case of emergency and invest responsibly. Just because tons of people on the internet are doing something, doesn't mean you should. Also you don't know if that mess is photoshopped! It's the internet! Those position posts could be completely fabricated for all we know! Gotta take those things with a grain of salt.

Also, you kind of have to have a solid stomach for risk/ loss. If you can't stomach seeing -$100 (or worse, -$730,000,) then maybe you should focus on retirement investing (like a Roth IRA or 401K if that's a possibility).

276,AAPL," Fellow new guy here, and what I’ve had to learn when dealing with losses (spent 1k on GME @ 320 lol) is to look at this like something like poker. Not the gambling aspect, but the fact you have to go into it realizing you’re inevitably going to take some losses. If you hyper focus on your losses it’s going to drive you crazy. But if you play it right, on average over enough time, you’re gonna come out on top. 

Look at the timeline for some stocks you’re interested in. I’ve put some amount into AAPL, some nuclear ETFs, some weed stocks/ETF. I went with those last  two because I feel like these are gonna be strong markets within the next decade, just based on sentiment about cannabis/clean and renewable energy resources. AAPL because I looked at the growth over the past 5 years and it’s basically a guarantee for some growth, but it just depends on how long I’m trying to wait. 

I’m not saying to invest in these particular stocks at all, just saying to look into stocks you have an idea about. Are you a tech guy? You might be following news that I’m not that could lead you to invest in a company you think is gonna be making moves in a couple years. There’s no definitive list of things to invest into or else we’d all be rich.

283,AMC," Are you trying to day trade? Are you trying to get rich quick? You shouldn't be, or rather if you are you should be treating it like gambling. Throw some play money in there and try to get lucky, sure. But what are your goals?

When I was 22 (15 years ago) I set up the allocations for my first 401k (just etfs and mutual funds, probably took me 15 minutes and didn't really understand what I was doing). I was only at the job for a few years and never bothered rolling it over, and as my new retirement account began to vastly exceed it I paid less attention to it (it was always going up reasonably so I didn't mess with it). Until last week I had never even rebalanced it - untouched for 15 years. In that time my average yearly return has been about 10% (15% over 5 years). That's probably not as good as it could be (my newer accounts are better but they also didn't have the big recession) and I'm not suggesting you literally ignore your accounts, but what I'm trying to say is over a long enough time period you have to work to lose money. Unless you've bought hot garbage (and ETFs and mutual funds exist to help reduce the risk of that) doing nothing is almost always a better move than doing something. Tou won't get rich quick and it's not very exciting.

Investing relatively safely for retirement accounts like that is one thing. But even trying to pick stocks you should be looking at the longer term (like, multiple years) in which case some near term losses should barely matter at all and you should just keep waiting. I'm not trying to be a fuddy duddy and tell you not to have some (careful, safe) fun trying to make some quick money (my dumb ass lost a little money on AMC stock!) but the amounts of money you put into that should be like Vegas money. If it disappears into thin air, well at least you got a little thrill.",OldPersonName,1,/r/stocks/comments/lltvdh/when_does_it_get_easier/gnruewq/,0.089,0.787,0.123,0.8822

287,AMC," It will take time. And even once you have it ""figured out"" you will see that you are still playing poker with half your cards face down. And that is ok. There are no guarantees, and you will likely make mistakes along the way. But while you are learning, here are some things that I came to figure out.
1st: know what you are putting your money into. While the latest pharmaceutical company may sound like a big bucks ticket, ask yourself what makes THESE people so great, compared to the others. Example: I want to get into marihuana stocks. But don't know the players, and yesterdays jumpers are falling. So I put some money into a marihuana ETF, and while it may lose money over the next few years, I have faith the industry will jump eventually. So I have faith to sit on it. 

2nd: know how much you want to put in, how much you are willing to lose on gambles, but also how long you can go without. 
I don't know your financial situation. Maybe you got a windfall, or maybe you are struggling paycheck to paycheck. It makes a big difference in how well you sleep at night when things drop. If you are struggling, set aside money that if everything goes belly up tomorrow, you can sit on it until it goes up again. 
3rd: seriously, have faith in what you invest in. I'll admit. I got greedy. I bought AMC at its highest point. Then once it dropped I realized I wasn't sure if they would survive the pandemic, and I sold. It is a harsh lesson, one I thought I was smart enough to avoid. Don't do that, please. And if you do, chalk it up as a learning experience. One that you can only learn on the ground floor. 
4th: safe money, and risk money. If you want your money to go up, but not quadruple an a day, then you can BE the market with stocks like VOO (It is what I buy because it is in my price range) it will, over time, grow as the market grows. (If you do not know what an ETF is, I advise doing some research, as they are generally safer)
Then the risk money. If you want some serious returns, understand that there is also potential for serious loss. Only put in what you are willing to lose. And don't think ""oh, well, if it drops by 50% I only lose XYZ"" because if it drops, then you will question every night if you overextended, and you will wonder if you should sell to cut your losses. And then, under stress, you make risky decisions, and may try to recoup losses only to lose more. Be careful. 
5th: drops happen. It is normal. If a drop occurs, like today, know it will go back up again. Even stock market crashes rise back up. Hold on, and if you are stressed, it is a sign you may have over extended. 
6th: trying to sell at the highest point may end up only followed by more gains. And you may be waiting for years for a drop to buy. Hop in, but understand that you won't always sell at the peak. Play the long run, unless you feel the stock is being artificially pumped, and you see the opportunity to get while the going is good. (Like if the odds were you had gamestop before it jumped crazy)
I hope this helps. Maybe I am saying things you already know. But the more you follow it, the more you learn. Just play it safe while you are learning. Oh, and if the market crashes...

If you like a company, like it's products, believe it's going in a good direction, can spot good opportunities for growth, etc... then it's worth investing into imo, assuming you can get in at a good price.

This does not mean, ""I really like Target, so I'm gonna buy Target stock."" You need to also be able to spot realistic avenues for growth that the company can take given their current position and where they are heading. These are definitely riskier than buying etfs and big companies, so the potential is obviously a lot more, but again, much more risks.

With this, I think it's important to find a rule to follow, whether it's no more than 5-10% or whatever you come up with. Personally I invest into these based on my confidence level with the growth of the company. This obviously has way more risks than the 5-10% rule, but thats just my risk tolerance right now.

Also note all those articles are from May 2019 (15th, 24th, 28th), right around when Tesla reached their 4 year low of $180.

Meanwhile I bought Tesla stock on Feb 29th, May 2nd, 21th, 24th for $237, $240, $204, $189. All of that was of course bullshit, half written by short sellers and analysts who didn't want to understand Tesla.

Point being, in a sea of negative sentiment picking out any real ""fundamentals"" is near impossible. You know with enough data you can always find a trend that supports your worldview.

If you want a more recent example of a ""meme"" company, in March I bought 100 shares of NVAX for $12. First of all, everyone on reddit knew that a vaccine for COVID-19 would never work because there wasn't one for SARS, MERS and so on. All the SARS vaccine caused liver damage or actually worsened reinfection. NVAX had failed several phase 3 trials and was known as a failure that had to sell of their manufacturing branch. Somehow BOTH their seasonal flu vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine passed their phase 3 trial, they got production for 150 million doses per month and the stock is at $267 (up 2,225%).

I was called dumb for investing in them as well, it being a ""meme company"", I think it was even said to be ""a penny stock pump and dump""; today they're a $17 billion company.

When the sentiment is the lowest, that's usually when you can get the best deal on undervalued companies. Tesla has been ""overvalued"" all the way from $40 billion market cap in mid 2019 to $800 billion market cap in 2021, all based on ""fundamentals"" like that actually means anything at all.

Also note all those articles are from May 2019 (15th, 24th, 28th), right around when Tesla reached their 4 year low of $180.

Meanwhile I bought Tesla stock on Feb 29th, May 2nd, 21th, 24th for $237, $240, $204, $189. All of that was of course bullshit, half written by short sellers and analysts who didn't want to understand Tesla.

Point being, in a sea of negative sentiment picking out any real ""fundamentals"" is near impossible. You know with enough data you can always find a trend that supports your worldview.

If you want a more recent example of a ""meme"" company, in March I bought 100 shares of NVAX for $12. First of all, everyone on reddit knew that a vaccine for COVID-19 would never work because there wasn't one for SARS, MERS and so on. All the SARS vaccine caused liver damage or actually worsened reinfection. NVAX had failed several phase 3 trials and was known as a failure that had to sell of their manufacturing branch. Somehow BOTH their seasonal flu vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine passed their phase 3 trial, they got production for 150 million doses per month and the stock is at $267 (up 2,225%).

I was called dumb for investing in them as well, it being a ""meme company"", I think it was even said to be ""a penny stock pump and dump""; today they're a $17 billion company.

When the sentiment is the lowest, that's usually when you can get the best deal on undervalued companies. Tesla has been ""overvalued"" all the way from $40 billion market cap in mid 2019 to $800 billion market cap in 2021, all based on ""fundamentals"" like that actually means anything at all.

333,CEO," While I don't see GME 'going to the moon', I think the new management team could turn the company around.

A company like Amazon is nearly impossible to compete with. Then Chewy came along and carved out a powerful niche in being an 'Amazon' for pet products.

\-buffett views fossil fuels industry as undervalued. CVX is well diversified in the industry so it has exposure to everything basically.

\-Buffet views verizon in general to be undervalued. Maybe thinks more demand for telecom services due to pandemic? Not sure on this one.

\-Buffett thinks pharma companies will benefit. Possibly from increased healthcare spending expanded healthcare programs (biden?)....or maybe more healthcare spending due to people getting sick during the pandemic?

\-Buffett thinks gold is overvalued.

CVS is an interesting beast in the pharmacy trifecta. They’ve made an aggressive move towards health care as you outline, but as they build these health hubs, they reduce the space for high margin center store categories (you guys have seen the prices in these pharmacies!)

But ultimately, if they can balance their split personality between ‘7-11’ and ‘Urgent Care’, and further refine it by geography (inner city locations have significantly different buying patterns than suburban & exurban locations) they will be successful and hit your targets.

384,CEO," Hi,

I’ve been following CVS since last summer. It is definitely becoming a healthcare play which is attractive. But I want to bring attention to the fact that their retail sector is declining. 

CVS is made up of roughly 3 sectors - Pharmacy (PBMs, pharmacy drug sales from target), Retail (where you buy diapers, plan B, etc.), and Healthcare (Aetna, Healthhubs, MinuteClinics). Pharmacy, Retail, Healthcare. 

CVS’ Pharmacy and Healthcare operating income each have been up roughly 20% since 2018. However, retail has been on a downward trajectory even before covid by dropping 20% operating income from 2018 to 2020. CVS retail is basically worthless when you realize a lot of their items such as Claritin or Melatonin can be bought much cheaper in bulk off of Amazon. 

It’s becoming clear that CVS’ Aetna acquisition was somewhat of a necessary play to offset the dying retail sector (there was chatter that Aetna was overpaid for, although CVS has maintained their dividend and trajectory to pay off the Aetna acquisition’s $72B debt by 2023 as originally promised).

CVS could be a great play still, and I’ll probably hold at $70. There is potential being vertically integrated by owning a PBM and Insurance. One of the big plays CVS is trying to make is by using consumer health data gained via Aetna and using that to create more personalized experiences for customers at the minuteclinics and healthhubs. But there are question marks surrounding their profitability. 

I’m not concerned about Medicare for all and Amazon’s Pillpak acquisition but they are other risks that potentially hurt CVS’ business. Retail, Pharmacy, and Healthcare each make up roughly 1/3 of CVS’ income so Pharmacy and Healthcare face an uphill battle trying to carry the dying Retail sector.

Edit: in the current low interest rate environment there is probably better money and general opportunity cost elsewhere such as FAANG. However, if CVS continues to pay off its debt, and Aetna/Pharmacy continues to grow under new CEO Karen Lynch CVS could realistically hit $100 in a few years.

Another edit: if you’re playing CVS hoping for a price pop from vaccine news like I was it won’t come.

393,CVS," > Aetna and CVS pharmacy can merge their collected customer data to recommend preventative treatment which will lower customer and insurance expenses by avoiding costly procedures as a result of a health crisis

If I remember correctly, they cannot share databases. One of the terms in the CVS/Aetna merger required a firewall between the two divisions. That being said, they already have a whole division, Accordant, that does exactly this for other payers, and I fully expect them to provide care management services to their Aetna patients. But they don’t need CVS data to do this. 

I’m bullish on CVS as well. Banking on new leadership trimming some fat and continuing to innovate. Drug shipping. Expanding provider services in MinuteClinics. Telehealth services via Aetna and Accordant. 

The biggest risk is PBM regulation. If you dig deep into the concept of a PBM, you’ll find that it’s pretty shitty for consumers and the market is far too consolidated between only 3-4 companies. The economist put out an [article](https://www.economist.com/business/2018/03/15/which-firms-profit-most-from-americas-health-care-system) a couple years ago that estimated something like 25% of consumer healthcare costs can be contributed to PBMs. The article is behind a paywall now, so I cannot check the exact figure. Regardless, it’s a huge cost that doesn’t exist in other countries that have single payer. And the regulatory threat is real. Here’s a recent [case](https://www.pharmacytimes.com/news/landmark-supreme-court-ruling-state-regulation-of-pbm-reimbursement-rates) where the Supreme Court ruled against PBMs. 

My bullish perspective is based on the fact that CVS is trying to invest away from its pharmacy/PBM businesses and towards provider and insurance services. They’re making smart moves for the long term and they have the cash flow to pull it off if leadership can execute.",hugsfunny,1,/r/stocks/comments/llm2pe/cvs_a_value_giant_with_cheap_leaps/gnsi0mh/,0.072,0.842,0.086,0.6384

400,CVS," You are right that retail is somewhat concerning. Ultimately I do believe that gains in the pharmacy and healthcare scenarios will outweigh these declining earnings but I think what you point out here is an important scenario which I should include in my forecasting. If you look at my revenue forecasting in the spreadsheet I shared, you'll see that I did forecast some scenarios where retail declined. However, I only had this occur in my ""bear case"" projections where the Aetna acquisition did not pay off and CVS slowly became encumbered by slowing earnings and a growing debt. In my bull case scenarios, I assumed that increased foot-traffic driven my health hubs and increased pharmacy  sales would also drive revenue growth. I think you make a good point that I should go back and forecast a scenario where the other two sectors grow, but retail continues to decline.

What about their climbing debt currently at 92% of their total assets! RAD is a dumpster fire of a company.

412,CVS," Yea Medicare for all will never happen. Kamala wants a 10 year transition but congress wouldn’t go for it. Despite a trump loss the House of Representatives lost a decent chunk of Democrats and saw gains in seats for the republicans. 

Pillpak could maybe kill the retail sector off sooner. But again Amazon doesn’t own a PBM so they have way less influence on CVS overall.

I should point out that retail’s revenue is still increasing. I remember they mentioned on either in the Q2 or Q3 2020 earnings call that they saw a drop in sales for higher margin retail items hence the income drop. And it is still possible for a post-covid rebound there. Although I don’t expect much from retail at this point yea. 

Even so the stock trades at a PE of 12 giving it a decent floor and has seen earnings growth averaging 20% a year for the last 10 years. The company had been well run to this point under Merlo, it’s just really a question of whether CVS can become a dominant healthcare player and the pieces are definitely there for the upside as well.",BigBrianBrand,1,/r/stocks/comments/llm2pe/cvs_a_value_giant_with_cheap_leaps/gnsllu4/,0.073,0.815,0.113,0.7305

417,AI," I don’t know why you’re latching on to the concept of adding a fitness studio to their real estate as if that’s CVS’s strategy moving forward. That’s laughable. 

They are able to maintain and grow market share in an already saturated areas because of their vertical integration. If you knew how the medical industry worked, the relationships between providers, payers, PBMs, pharmacies, and big data, this would be clear as day. Moreover, they are one of the companies that saturate the market. They have 250B annual revenues. This isn’t some random health startup that’s trying to take business from UNH. 

But regardless, CVS’s strategies align well with the movement of the health sector in general. They are a leader in no-apt-necessary amb clinics. Growing their telehealth care management rapidly. Sending meds in the mail. Using AI to offer targeted preventative care. Offerings “wellness” services. And so on.

Had already checked options as you mentioned and totally agree to 135ish at least for the next weeks. That strike price has been keeping it steady for the previous weeks too, with dips to 133.

It seems the support line is on 132 now so I'm holding for now, but will exit if it hits 129-130 as it might be breaking out.

sRSI says oversold, also low volume seems to point to not a real breakout happening today at 132.

If it is not breaking out, it seems to be bouncing back to 145ish some time around March. And yeah even further if it breaks through the roof.

With the run up in AAPL’s share price, taking profits from a long-term investment is reasonable - particularly when pairing gains with tax - losses.

655,TX," No - this tech is already used in the rest of the nation.  Texas isn't part of the national grid; it's been dealing with this problem (blackouts during deep freezes) for decades; energy companies don't want to spend money weatherizing the grid and the state legislature (who all work for energy companies) won't force the utilities to do it.  Most of TX electric is produced by oil  & gas plants - which freeze over as easily as renewable gen but the result is still the same - TX gas companies can't sell product they're not producing.

The rest is just the geopolitics of waning US influence in East Asia as China sphere of influence increases.  Which has been going on for 20-30 years now.

666,DD," When I first started trading in 2010 I signed up for investing newsletters and one of them newsletters were talking about how uranium and rare earth metals would skyrocket in price. They argued that demand for uranium would start to exceed supply driving price up and that China (being the largest rare earths mining country in the world) is considering banning sale of rare earth metals to the United States. Sorry, I can't remember the name of that newsgroup as I discontinued my subscription after two years. It's just ironic to me that the same uranium/rare earth metals pumping is going on as it did back then. Maybe it's cyclical but if China was going to restrict sale of rare earth metals I think they would have done it during Trump's trade war. Just my two cents.

667,MP," That’s correct. 

In November 2020, MP Materials, which supplies rare earth materials to defense systems, electric vehicles, and wind turbines, went public through a reverse merger with PIPE, which was led by Chamath Palihapitiya. 

Rare earth minerals will likely be in demand over the next decade as the global economy transitions towards renewable energy. Incidentally, green energy stocks have risen sharply in 2020 in anticipation of supportive policies towards renewable energy and electric vehicles.

You are buying purely on FOMO and got lucky on a trade. Look at the 1 month chart on TLRY. Or APHA. They are merging. Know a lot about a stock you want to buy. When are earnings? Do they pay a dividend? What is the x-dividend date?

AAPL had earnings recently and beat every expectation. The stock dropped. Why? Because it did. It dropped because more people were selling than buying. 

AMC has earnings this week or soon. They will have lousy earnings. Will it drop? Who knows. They got a $1B infusion of cash and the vaccine appears to be effective. 

If a stock trades at $20 and it falls to $10 you lost 50%. How much does it have to rise to get back to $20? 100%. 

Not to discourage you but to encourage you. 

XLF is an ETF that buys the banks. Are you bullish on banks? XLU us an ETF that buys utilities. XLV is an ETF for health care. Look at the charts. Watch them. 

I’m bullish on GM. Should you buy it now. I think so. 

I’m bullish on QCOM and I have a position. Should you buy it now? I would watch it and determine a better entry point. 

Look at the charts. They don’t lie.

794,GME," not financial advice.... for sure lol

I’m assuming you’re looking for fast growth, if not, just dollar cost average money into some solid ETF. However if you want fast gains, unfortunately the stock market is horrible for that. It basically boils down to 3 options: 

1) low probability of success options trading on companies you really think are gonna take off, or absolutely tank. Short expirations and way OTM. Think how WSB was making money off GME

2) penny stocks... and you gotta go all in, otherwise 10% invested into a penny stock that shoots up 100% (pretty unlikely) will still only give you a 10% gain.

3) margin. Use margin to buy more QUALITY stocks than you should be able to afford.

Look into ETFs. Like emerging markets, green energy... stuff that’s gonna grow. For example I like $QCLN, $EEMA.... but this is NOT financial advice, do your own DD. Returns are not always consistent.

807,GME," Yo op this is super important. My experience in the last two months has brought me to this same conclusion.

I recently graduated college and got into trading using some internship money (\~6k) during the GME hype. In the rise and fall I experienced, at the top, unrealized gains of \~10k, followed by the massive dip which I barely managed to walk away from, netting 1k. Ever since then Ive been chasing that next high, spending hours every day researching DD's and getting familiar with investment strategies. 

Since then ive made about \~$700 in a month timeframe, which sounds pretty great on paper but considering the amount of time I spent I'd say its not worth it.

The reality is trading is a massive time sink without guaranteed returns and HUGE potential risk if you dont know what youre doing. And even if you pour hours and hours into researching positions you may be fundamentally missing the mark when there are tons of logically sound arguments for and against any investment strategy. How do you distinguish the right play when there exists both bearish and bullish arguments that seem strong? or when some idiot posts rocket emojis and beats out the 2 page well written argument against it? via experience, which is something hard to get by when youre new to trading.

This shit is hard.

808,HUGE," Yo op this is super important. My experience in the last two months has brought me to this same conclusion.

I recently graduated college and got into trading using some internship money (\~6k) during the GME hype. In the rise and fall I experienced, at the top, unrealized gains of \~10k, followed by the massive dip which I barely managed to walk away from, netting 1k. Ever since then Ive been chasing that next high, spending hours every day researching DD's and getting familiar with investment strategies. 

Since then ive made about \~$700 in a month timeframe, which sounds pretty great on paper but considering the amount of time I spent I'd say its not worth it.

The reality is trading is a massive time sink without guaranteed returns and HUGE potential risk if you dont know what youre doing. And even if you pour hours and hours into researching positions you may be fundamentally missing the mark when there are tons of logically sound arguments for and against any investment strategy. How do you distinguish the right play when there exists both bearish and bullish arguments that seem strong? or when some idiot posts rocket emojis and beats out the 2 page well written argument against it? via experience, which is something hard to get by when youre new to trading.

This shit is hard.

810,SA," I started with their books in the early 2000s and subscribed to SA and Rule Breakers off and on since. I started buying individual stocks with a small corner of my portfolio in 2004 but now most of my portfolio is in individual stocks. I always track against the market but didn’t start tracking on the calendar year until 2011. Since then I’m up 752% compared to the s&p at 323%. That includes a chunk of my portfolio which was just index funds tracking the s&p. 

Not everything I pick is from their advice and not all their picks have worked out great for me, but they have been good for keeping me on the right path for long term investment. It was especially helpful to have that reinforcement during the recession. I still have my pre-iphone Apple stock and 10 year old Amazon shares. I didn’t panic or worry because they told me it would happen one day and they told me what to expect.

853,LNG, Why did you pick Shell? If I invested in an oil company it would be one with zero North American land exposure. Which is Total. Schlumberger is the best of breed oilfield services company and its revenue is directly tied to the price of oil. The oil majors had bloated balance sheets. But the services never went into growth at all costs mode after the last oil downturn. They were the ones that got crushed. Baker Hughes has a terrific balance sheet with strong cash flow as well as a highly profitable LNG turbo machinery division as well.

Pros: Easy way to double/triple your money because at this point, this thing has a 95% chance of going though. Big institutional money are already pouring in at the current price point and you'd be dumb not to ride the trend upwards. Lucid is going to be a big EV player for the next decade.

924,CEO," i think the better way to look at this is.. what are companies in the small market share. I can dilute apple shares down to $1 per share if i was a CEO. Price of stock is not as representative of size of company. (if your brokerage has fractional shares, this shouldn't be an issue). 

My best thought would be if you have >$10,000 or even $25,000, it'd be better to just save up, put it into Apple or any blue chip company, and wait till you have more money to invest in small cap. **I'm not saying small cap is bad, a lot of my research these days is in small-cap and i'm a big fan, but there is tremendous amount of risk.** 

The general mentality (not all) of trading is drastically different between >10k and <10k. The main reason is b/c when you only have $1000 , $2000, i see a lot of ""i can earn this back in a month i'll just go all-in in this small-cap"". But the issue is this is a game of miles, not inches. Going all-in like that is similar to going to a casino.

BB (small position) - current price 12.21
I like their cyber security, number of patents, existing partnerships and long term outcome

POWW Ammo Inc (no position) - current price 8.96
Read some good DD if you search it (I’m on mobile) and have seen issues with ammo shortages this company has the power to address

RYCEY Rolls Royce (small position) trading at around 1.50
I don’t think this company will fail and it can be had for cheap. Long term play here.

962,RH," People need to understand that in this world of instant buying and selling you are doing it all on the broker's credit until accounts are settled, which take 1 to 2 or even more business days. This is why you usually see ""settled cash"" line items on most investment apps. It is letting you know what is actually done for real, and what is pending on credit. Nothing is REALLY instant. 

What you did is tell RH to sell shares it didn't control and had sent to fidelity. So it sold those shares on credit (margin) then the system figured out you didn't own them. that made a margin deficit for you. 

at the same time, the computer is now thinking it sent shares to fidelity you do not own either, so it is on RH's credit to compensate fidelity, invalidate the transfer, creating the second deficit of the equal amount. 

You created two conflicts in the system. Told RH to sell shares it didn't have, then having it finalize a transfer on shares you didn't own.

This will likely settle out in time, but it was a majorly boneheaded move to sell stocks you were transferring.",nevetando,1,/r/stocks/comments/llyykr/robinhood_sold_all_my_shares_and_charged_me_twice/gnsyjli/,0.027,0.882,0.091,0.7783
963,AG," I like **VOO** for someone 40 and over to begin with. Broad market fund indexed to the S&P 500 Index.  This is a good place to start.

I would augment that with at least two additional funds:

**VXUS**:  essentially and emerging (foreign) markets fund.  Generally I'm not fond of most foreign ETFs, but this one has rebalanced over the past year and added some tickers that I think should do well for the foreseeable future.  Top holdings include:  Tencent, Taiwan Semiconductors, Alibaba Group, Samsung Electronics, Nestle, Roche AG, and Toyota. 

**IWF**:  IWF is a Russell 2000 Index fund. It is a fund that invests in small-cap companies in the US market.  The Russell 2000 index is not as talked about as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrials, but is the third most often looked at index to gauge how well the economy is doing. 

For someone under 40, I would recommend splitting the remainder of your portfolio across several sector funds that might be more risky, but also greater opportunity for growth.  For someone over 40 and someone who is looking to ""compliment individual stock trading,"" I would probably stick with the three funds above and put about an equal weight into each of them.  There is virtually no crossover between the funds, so there is no duplication of effort, here.

That said, this is a conservative strategy.  I see it as a nice complement to investing in individual stocks, especially if your stock portfolio has a fair bit of risk.  If you are interested in a more ""growth focused"" but higher risk strategy, there are a number of funds that are likely to outperform these, but the risks are, of course, greater.

967,UK," I see a lot of posts about weed stocks in the US with the thought that legalization is right around the corner. But I think that's extremely optimistic. The more likely outcome will be decriminalization. If decriminalized you'll see some states expand their marijuana industry and you'll see better banking laws, but you won't see an explosion of the industry.

I don't know what stocks are available to you in the UK. But if you were looking to invest in the US, I'd consider an ETFMG Alternative Harvest or Horizons Life Sciences ETF. There are also a number of OTC companies that are possible good plays, but again, I'm not sure what you have access to.

Investing in marijuana presents a really strong growth opportunity, but it's still a bit of a long term play due to a lot of the uncertainty.

EDIT: and if you look at what happened in Canada when they legalized everything you get a sense at what could happen in the UK. Stocks did well when they legalized, but then once people realized that legalization doesn't immediately transfer into profits, stocks retracted.

I predict that PLTR shares will be priced between $20 a $24 by Friday, and hell yeah I will be loading up shares for the long term. !!!!

I bet institutions are dancing because now they get the opportunity to buy PLTR shares at a much reduced price.

1041,CAN," I love Poshmark. Three current popular trends - online shopping, secondhand goods, and social media are what it combines and excels at.

It seems like the two people that have commented thus far don't have any real experience on Poshmark.

The vast majority is used clothing. The ""boutique"" feature, which you CAN toggle on or off, are small resellers that just got a few pieces of their items directly through retail arbitrage. In general, Posh specializes in fashionable second-hand clothes and it is the #1 app for that.

My side hustle is reselling. I have tried all apps. eBay, Mercari, depop, Poshmark, etc.. and Poshmark is by far the one with the most potential. It integrates social media with shopping which has been very popular. It's the preferred app in my area for any women 40 and under in my area to buy their closet. If you're a Becky, you most likely shop at Poshmark. eBay, it's biggest competion, is dying - at least when it comes to terms of where woman prefer to shop for secondhand clothing. Most of my friends on and offline prefer shopping anywhere else.

If you sell anything worth $500+, it gets sent to Poshmark for verification of authenticity so while sure, you could buy a counterfeit.. they actually offer more protection than any other app I have been on. eBay it is way easier to come across someone who will scam you, whether that be a buyer or a seller.

If you look on Youtube or Instagram, they have a mass following, especially for younger woman.

They just entered the pets market and they expanded to Australia (and plan to move to Europe this year).

I personally think it can be as big of Etsy (I sell my stuff on their and love it - of all the selling platforms, Etsy and Poshmark are my favorite.. they just are different. Etsy you can really only sell items you actually make or truly vintage pieces).",letsgetgalactic,1,/r/stocks/comments/llxbky/do_you_think_poshmark_stock_is_over_valued/gns2mo7/,0.015,0.887,0.098,0.9805

1044,GDP," It's pretty easy to see, but you'll never see it before the algos.

As the economy expands consumer demand will rise faster than supply. Due to limited supply and high demand prices will naturally rise on common products. Inflation.

As inflation rises purchasing power does not (most paychecks are not adjust to meet inflation) so central banks move to check this inflation with a variety of monitary tools such as intrest rates. Governments may also take advantage by raising taxes.

As taxes and intrest rates rise demand falls, businesses see less of a profit and cuts in production (supply). These cuts lead to less jobs, less consumer spending, less income for businesses. 

This SHOULD move into equity prices as a lagging indicator.

It's just a natural part of the business cycle. Central banks seek to smooth these curves through monetary policy, one of their key roles is to check down inflationary and deflationary periods. This is why you hear the FED talk about ""inflation targets"", as they want to monitor inflation to ensure prices do not rise to a point where consumers can no longer purchase goods and they want to stop deflation since it hurts the production side of the economy.

Edit: To answer your question further, people who time bull and bear markets keep an eye on key indicators like consumer spending, real GDP, unemployment, inflation and try to predict of the economy is still growing or headed towards a recession. COVID should have been a recession, but the FED intervened by creating one of the most lucrative business environments possible (low intrest rates, near infinite lending), and the government intervened to ensure demand stayed in place (PPP, unemployment, stimilus). At this point inflation has not driven prices up, but the theory is that with so much free money flowing that eventually it will. You best bet is to keep track of consumer goods like milk, eggs, gas...if these prices start to rise you should be worried. More money on groceries = less money for iPhones...which is bad for the market (again...in theory).",Banned_by_WSB_thrice,2,/r/stocks/comments/llorww/what_are_stock_market_downturns_caused_by_normal/gnr69rw/,0.125,0.759,0.116,-0.5346

-buy 100 SPCE @ 47.98
-sell 1 Feb 26 call @ 50 strike and 3.40 premium
-wait until Feb 26th to see if the option gets assigned or not. 

Thats it in a basic way. You get to keep that 3.40 premium no matter what, and if the stock gains up to 50.00 on the close date, you must then sell for 50.00, making the gain plus the premium. 

Theres a lot more to be said about them but thats the basics.",G1G1G1G1G1G1G,2,/r/stocks/comments/llyszw/help_me_understand_how_cover_calls_work/gns6pac/,0.028,0.923,0.049,0.2732
1093,SPCE," Check out ‘inthemoney’ on youtube. He’s very clear on his explaination. They are a great thing to use. Not to complicate things but you will also make money when the stock goes down. So if that SPCE continues tanking like it is right now and goes down another 10%, the call will be about 50% profitable for you. At that point you can roll the call down if youd like, buying back the call you sold for much less and selling another at a lower strike price for a higher premium. 

What I like about the strategy is it gives you many (sorry the pun) options on how to keep making money regardless of how the market is doing.",G1G1G1G1G1G1G,1,/r/stocks/comments/llyszw/help_me_understand_how_cover_calls_work/gns9ugk/,0.035,0.825,0.14,0.9266
