0,SNDL," That’s the price of that option today…. How far back did you buy it?

It has a theta of -0.0021 so don’t expect big swings in price in a day.

I wouldn’t trade penny stock options. Try the boring stocks first or even an index. The problem with penny stocks options is that liquidity might not be that high so unless you actually own those 100 stocks of SNDL and you exercise it that PUT option might end up expiring as you might be unable to resell it even if it’s ITM. If you don’t have the stocks but have the capital to buy it you might want to wait for it to go down and buy the underlying so you can exercise the contract and make *some* profit… since you bought the option at $0.69 you would have to wait for the stock to fall below $0.81 for exercising the option to make a buck or two; otherwise you just gave away $69… don’t worry much, it’s tuition for a lesson learned.",AmrasVardamir,5,/r/RobinHood/comments/our6m6/ive_made_a_mistake_and_now_i_am_confused/h74fe2u/,0.043,0.949,0.008,-0.7096
1,IBKR," Options almost never change 1 to 1 with the underlying. You also have to look at volatility and time. So a change in share price is only part of the equation. Dollar for dollar a meme stock is going to have higher priced options than a less volatile stock. Likewise an option will be more expensive the further you are from expiration. 

I don't know that stock well, but my guess would be the decline in price was offset by the approaching expiration or it became less volatile. 

I don't know about other brokers, but IBKR tells you the breakeven point. It's an estimate, as volatility can change but it good to check but it tells you how much the price needs to change to make money.",SeattleBattles,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/our6m6/ive_made_a_mistake_and_now_i_am_confused/h74i4rz/,0.0,0.943,0.057,0.7296
2,SNDL," You are correct at what it does.  But you need to understand how options work.

The put becomes ITM (In The Money) when SNDL is below $1.50.  It's at .82, meaning it is 68 cents below the $1.50 strike.

However, you paid 69 cents for it, making your break even price 81 cents (1.50 - .69).    So on the EXPIRATION DAY if SNDL is selling for less than .81 cents per share, you will start to make more money than you paid for it.

Expiration is still two weeks away and options have something called theta (or time value) that decays away.  In the case of Puts, theta is negative, meaning it takes away from the price of the put, and it decays up tp zero. 

At expiration there will be no time value left, so the option will be selling for $1.50 - whatever the price is on expiration day.   If the price goes down to 80 cents on expiration day, then your option will be worth 70 cents.  You would be able to sell it for a .01 contract profit ( 70 cents minus your cost of 69 cents = 0.01 times 100 shares = $1)

That was not a good put option to buy.  The most you could net on it would be $81 if SNDL went completely to $0, which probably won't happen in the next two weeks, and you lose if SNDL goes up between now and then.   I'd sell it back for 61 cents and call the $8 you lost on the deal ""tuition""...

To quote the previous comment   ""Your mistake was using options before understanding what they are, how they work, and what risks could affect their value.""",Grayhawk4,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/our6m6/ive_made_a_mistake_and_now_i_am_confused/h74ijoa/,0.103,0.848,0.048,-0.9528
3,SNDL," First, definitely read up more on options before buying another one. 

That said, it’s price will go up if SNDL does fall. However a deep ITM put like that will have poor volume and liquidity.  I see a volume of 2 today and open interest of 27, that’s very low. So eventually selling this put could be difficult since there’s barely any activity. 

The low volume also results in wide bid/ask spreads that cause the mark price to bounce around erratically. That’s why you’ll show some weird gains or losses with low liquidity options. 

My advice would be to have a good til canceled sell order of $0.69, hope it fills, and in the future avoid buying super low liquidity options like that. Read up more on basic options strategies and then try again with a very insignificant amount of money.

Edit: a better strategy in this case, if you’re bearish on SNDL, would be to buy the 8/13 $1 put for $0.22. Volume of 200 today and over 5,000 open interest.",UnhingedCorgi,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/our6m6/ive_made_a_mistake_and_now_i_am_confused/h74iwk9/,0.123,0.732,0.145,0.7379

305,COIN," Question about avoiding flipping pre-IPO shares if you’re trying to trade the stock beyond those IPO shares. Say I got 100 at $38 (I know, what an incredible deal). If I buy 100 more today, then sell those 100, does it not discern between the original shares bought at $38, and does it dip into the original shares randomly and think I’m “flipping” them - or does it not matter and will it not be considered “flipping” as long as I stay above the original 100 shares?

As a side-note, after trying the “pre-IPO” access here I’m having a hard time understanding what the perk was supposed here. Could I not have simply waited till the bell and set a limit order after it opened where it was supposed to at 38 (or if I was smart, waited and watched the price action), and then no one would have been like “naughty, naughty” if I wanted to sell those? It seems like there’s no perks if so -  only negatives - to that “early-access” IPO feature on RH (or HOOD now I guess)? I suppose I thought it was like COIN where if it was supposed to open at $250 and opened at $380 or wherever you’d have shares from $250 (which obviously didn’t happen here), but now I’m wondering if you’d just have the shares at $380 if COIN had been through the RH IPO “early access feature?”",stilleatingcarrots,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/ouhpbh/daily_discussion_thread_july_30th_2021/h73wxtx/,0.03,0.858,0.112,0.9385

308,HOOD," I appreciate the response! I guess $20 is where SOFI is about now (and WSB and Atlas want a squeeze on that one, unlike HOOD which they want to die). 

Just to clarify, if I continue to hold my 100 “pre-IPO” shares (blah) for 30 days, but buy more today to reduce my cost average, then sell the additional shares I bought later (keeping 100), it won’t see that as a “flipping” penalty?",stilleatingcarrots,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/ouhpbh/daily_discussion_thread_july_30th_2021/h742vbt/,0.054,0.826,0.12,0.2124
