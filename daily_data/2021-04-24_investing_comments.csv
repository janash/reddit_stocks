Yes, the eternal debate wrt diversification is always a) what assets/baskets should be represented, and b) what is the ideal allocation/rebalancing strategy.

4,TDA," TDA is my broker and I use micro e-minis^((SPY is an ETF)^).  
I am not recommending someone actually take on 1900% exposure to stocks, just that you can use them for capital efficiency in order to fit more of the other assets/strategies that OP uses while raising your overall risk to a similar level as stocks or whatever target you have. Margin call risk is a practical consideration that can be avoided with very frequent rebalancing but that's annoying. Figuring out a good, practical rebalancing strategy is an important discussion, but you don't need to have that discussion in order to talk about leveraging a low vol portfolio in order to achieve higher returns than a (relatively) undiversified 100% stocks portfolio. (And I just want to add a disclaimer that I don't really endorse the dragon portfolio or its allocations to CTA and managed long vol for retail investors.

11,TSLA," It's great and impressive!  Where the problem lies is people have trouble timing the market over the long-run and how risky her holdings are to have during a bear market.

She's only really invested in a bull market.

When we have these long bull markets it is pretty easy to beat the market, at least on some level... if not this much or more. You just put your money into riskier stocks that has more innovation, momentum, and more room for future growth.

The catch is if you can keep all of your gains when there is a bear market in the future. The same stocks that go up more now, will go down more in a future bear market. The reason for this is these types of innovating growth stocks are being valued and priced on their momentum to grow future revenue. Their P/E ratios are often considerably higher, but there is a real innovation/market disruption coming from that company. The problem is many people see that and buy it and the price grows beyond what their current revenue would make it worth. They are pricing assumptions of future growth in revenue. In a recession that future revenue growth is at high risk and it the stock price will fall faster and further.

You have 3 basic strategies, without getting into options or anything complicated you can play:

1) Stay the course. Keep taking bigger gains hoping that will over power the losses in downturns (ie. If you bought TSLA, you're hoping they're going to sell 25% of the cars on the road before there is a bear market and investors will get huge gains as the growth company gains a stronger foothold in the market that turns to a permanent change)

2) Choose when to get out before a bear market and invest in safer things that are more defensive or value oriented before a bear market. The problem is the moment she does this her huge gains year-to-year will go down and her annualized gains will drop. She has to have the will to get out of the riskier high growth stocks before a downturn, while they still are making some gains.

3) You can diversify your portfolio to own combinations of both. This is what most people do, especially ETF index investors...whether they know it or not. You won't get the annualized growth that large, but you're investing in many things that are safer for the bear market and things that are making large gains for the bull market. This means you're annualized growth rate during the bull market will be lower then what your friend has done, but it might stay higher through both the bull and bear markets.

&#x200B;

I tend to be diversified, but I buy more growth stocks and innovation stocks when I feel like the bull market is young, stable, and has room to run.

I then buy more value stocks when the bull market has been around for awhile, the market has high P/E ratios (like right now), and the bull market each year has more risk of ending.

In doing this I miss out on a few years of bull market gains, but I'm safely switched over to safer stocks with stable, lower P/E ratios before a bear market or a bubble bursts. 

&#x200B;

There are two sides to investing, you want to maximize gains and you want to manage the risks. This is why people balance portfolios and this is where people run into trouble timing the market. It is the timing of the shift to the bear markets and asset bubbles that bursts and you need to be prepared.",cwdawg15,1,/r/investing/comments/mxrodc/is_this_good_22_returns_for_85_years/gvr16sq/,0.072,0.731,0.197,0.998
12,AMZN," 22% returns for that period of time is excellent, certainly higher than the vast majority of hedge fund managers and individuals during that time. There is still a large amount of luck when picking individual companies over that period of time though. I have 20%+ annual returns over the past 5 years and will be the first to say there was a large amount of luck, having sizeable amounts of AMZN and TSLA. 

Warren Buffet has averaged ~18% returns over the past 60 years. Given the number of investors out there, plenty of people will hit this at the 5, 10, maybe 15 year marks. What ends up distinguishing millionaires from billionaires are those select few who can do it consistently through their lifetime and time and again with different stocks.

But is it realistic that a typical investor can expect these returns? Absolutely not. Nobody knew what was coming for Apple. Personally I thought it was going to die. They lost a billion dollars that year.

38,AMZN," Someone should calculate the total earnings per share over the last 22 or 23 years for Amazon, and then figure out the annualized earnings return on investment.

No wait: I have some data for you.  Been tracking AMZN for a long time.

My AMZN quarterly data goes back to 2Q 2004.   Since then:

Total GAAP EPS:  $106.50 / Shr

Total Revenue: $1,710,322,000,000

Net Margin:   0.00000062%

In the last week of Q2 2004, the high price for AMZN stock was $54.70.  So, if we were calculating return on investment based on EPS, the annual return on the $54.70 invested in Q2 2004 would be 4.06%.  However, just based on the stock price, which reflects a prediction of uncertain future returns, the annual return on AMZN is  27.8%",hendrix_srv,1,/r/investing/comments/mxdrej/snap_q1_earnings_report_is_pretty_good/gvq42tn/,0.035,0.934,0.031,-0.128
