0,VS," In general, i agree with OP. But the important distinction is buying and holding VS buying and selling- it’s just that it is easier (for many of us ) to buy and hold etfs than to buy and hold stocks long term. 

If you are trading stocks in a taxable account- even if you hold over a year so we are talking long term capitol gains- whatever you lose to taxes has essentially diminished your returns and this can be significant for a long term investor. Because the $1500 you pay in tax on $10,000 long term capital gain may not seem that bad this year ( after all you still made $8500!) BUT that $1500 invested over the next 20 years would add up. ( at 7 percent compounded, it would be $ 6000- it would roughly double 2x)  And each year you get capital gains on whatever you reinvest in and sell,  and lose more in tax you are further bleeding out the value of the account. (If you truly buy and hold stocks and don’t sell it is not a problem) - so anything you buy and hold “ forever” does not have to do as well year to year as an account with even moderate amount of buying and selling. Buying and selling stocks ( or etfs) - Year to year you may have better returns- before taxes. But maybe not after. 
Obviously it depends on how much better you do than the  etfs - consistently- ( or if you do better)- but i suspect for many of us one or a few good broad index etfs held long term is a better choice. I’ve decided it is for me. 
- if you are buying and selling the etfs frequently- for example moving in and out of sectors- this does not apply. It is the relatively frequent buying and selling - and subsequent taxes- that diminishes your returns. 

OPs statement about etfs being tax advantaged is really in relation to the bit of rebalancing some people would do if holding stocks compared to an etf. The rebalancing that happens in the etf doesn’t cost us. fundamentally the big issue is holding something long term vs tax cost of buying and selling repeatedly. 

( my story for those not already bored)
- I have a mix of stocks and ETFs personally. And it’s only recently that the compounding effect of the tax cost over the years started to register with me. Before 2020 i did much l less trading. Since my brokerage account kept growing and I pay tax out of my checking account -the long term implication of trading- and resultant taxes- on overall growth didn’t quite register until this year. ( when i had enough capital gains that i needed to sell stocks to get the cash to pay my taxes).

-  in2020  i moved away from etfs and more into individual stocks because i feel the indexes were/ are getting distorted by a few overpriced and over hyped stocks. Indexes are basically forced to buy high and sell low when bubbles happen- so i decided to Cherry pick some stocks i had more faith in to “ rebalance”. - and i did a bit of gambling/ speculation on a few stocks too-some winning, some not- but now I’m sitting on capital gains and spending too much time trying to decide what to buy and sell. ( do you sell the stock with big gains to lock them in or the stock with losses that may go back up, or just ignore the question for now, etc) - meanwhile if i had left my money invested in the funds i sold as covid hit, id have had twice the gains- and paid no tax- and not be spending so much time obsessing over what to buy and sell.  (It’s the only time i ever sold on  news-  i always sat through dips before) anyhow,  lesson learned. Now trying to move slowly mostly back into etf funds, without incurring too much tax.",trurohouse,2,/r/stocks/comments/ocr43c/etfs_are_basically_tax_advantages_accounts/h3xk183/,0.054,0.834,0.112,0.992

4,MO," I'd argue ETFs perform below the average individual stock picker.

You suggest a small advantage in the ETF being able to sell for long term capital gains at all times, but every ETF has loser stocks I don't want, and ETFs tend to buy in late and sell late.

6,AMC," ETFs can be doing many things. For instance, take a look at SFYF

https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfyf/

SoFi will rebalance this automatically every month. So picture what that means. Right now AMC is a hot stock with SoFi investors, so AMC is 12% of SFYF. But say AMC starts crashing in 3 months, and people start dumping. Then SFYF will rebalance automatically, sell and replace with something else.

You don't have to move a finger. SFYF is rebalancing automatically for you, and handling loses and gains. You don't see any taxes on that.

Another example is leveraged stuff. Something like TQQQ rebalances daily. So gains or losses are realized automatically, you don't have to do anything and you don't get taxed for every daily transaction.

Imagine trying to do these things on your own buying the stock directly.",Banner80,21,/r/stocks/comments/ocr43c/etfs_are_basically_tax_advantages_accounts/h3w9lvy/,0.068,0.866,0.065,-0.1016

MF are less liquid. You can’t trade them during the day or have options capability, and is only traded between the fund originator and you. Note that doesn’t mean you can only buy Vanguard MF from a Vanguard account- you can buy them from most brokerages still.

One thing to note is it’s best not to hold an actively-managed MF or ETF (ARK funds for example) in a tax-free account like a Roth IRA or 401K due to the high fees. You can’t escape the fees in any account but in a taxable or tax-deferred account at least the fees will offset your gains to reduce your taxes.",alwayslookingout,5,/r/stocks/comments/ocr43c/etfs_are_basically_tax_advantages_accounts/h3xwqzm/,0.0,0.923,0.077,0.8201
10,AI," FWIW, not all of Vanguard's MF fees are that high.  VWINX a pretty conservative fund, with much of its assets wrapped up bonds/mortgage securities, the expense ratios are going to be higher than an index fund because there's more to manage (or was pre-rise of AI managed funds). Also, the .22% expense ratio is actually among the lowest in this class of funds.

VTI will out perform in bull markets and over all, but in severe bear markets / crashes will underperform. If you're in/at retirement, VWINX gets more attractive because you're not earning income and can't weather a big down turn in the market. Looking at 2002 or 2008 -- in both those years VTI was down 21% & 37% respectively.  VWINX was down 5% & 10%. Much better place if you're not in the workforce anymore.

40,DTE," disagree with what your saying.

for a defined risk stategy some backtesting shows its better to hold till expiry rather than quickly cut losses.

for a loss, dont cut them. you should roll the contract up and out if its a short call/put is tested.

You can chase higher gains and be greedy if you believe you have an edge thats not priced in.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

what i think new people should do is....

have most contracts that you are long at least 45 DTE. I average around 90 DTE. I do minimum  of 30 DTE and Max of 100 DTE.

For most contracts i dont buy OTM calls. 

Try to balance your greeks by selling options either in spreads to reduce theta decay of your accounts.

51,DTE," Well I’m buying 45 DTE credit spreads or ratio spreads. 60 DTE if you want more security but if it goes against you you’ll have a liquidity issue when rolling your strat. 

With that in mind, depending of the underlying and IV I enter at 5 - 15 deltas (aiming for 10 delta position). 

I then wait, collect premiums and close at 50% premiums (25% - 50% for ratio spreads) or 21 DTE (when waiting more you collect more premiums but the additional Vega risk isn’t worth it) 

I’m aiming for 0.1% Theta collected of my overall portfolio per day. With compound and market movers I’m managing to achieve 7% return per month. Currently at about 180% 1Y return.

Spreads allows you more flexibility but can complicate things quite a bit, lowers your liquidity (now you have to enter+exit two separate positions instead of just one), and you pay more transaction fees to the broker (directly like on TD or indirectly through bid/ask scalping). 

You can also get assigned early whenever you sell an option which can really mess up your account if that option was part of a spread.

The greatest described threat has been the rise of fintech, and JPM has the awareness, humility, and cash required to adapt and thrive. This is a very old company which is still a power in its space, and has proven that it can stay at the top as other powerful companies rise and fall. You may not like this choice, but it would be silly to say that it’s a poor selection if limited to one stock.",BetweenCoffeeNSleep,10,/r/stocks/comments/ocl08v/if_you_could_only_buy_1_stock_for_the_rest_of/h3vu3up/,0.093,0.822,0.085,-0.4506

119,GE," Microsoft in the 1990s was the most valuable company in the world switching spots with GE, it is currently the only company that was in the top 10 list in 1990 and is currently still top 10 right now (at #2 spot behind apple). It was the #1 company by marketcap in 2019 and march 2020.

Moreover, It has never fallen out of the top 10 list for more than 20+ years even with failure of Ballmer, tech bubble crash, Nokia, etc. Now with the new ceo, I dont see it going out of the top 10 especially since it is so far ahead from #10 spot which is Alibaba at 600 billion market cap. (Microsoft is worth 2.1 trillion).

Back in the 1990s #1 spot had 200 billion valuation compared to 100 billion for #10 spot. So now the Top 5 companies are much more valuable compared to the bottom 5 of the list. Unlike the 1990s the top companies were not investing to the future and focus on short term profits.

Microsoft continues to invest in the future with the cloud technology, ai, vr/ar tech as well as is extremely diversified with equal 33% weight in 3 different classified segments.(the other trillion companies aren't as diversified). Finally, it is one of two companies (other being JNJ) with triple AAA credit rating, higher than the US government. It faces less regulatory risk than tech giants competitors allowing for easy acquisitions thanks to its stellar balance sheet.

One is that they have unbelievably tight stop losses. If they even get a hint that they’re trade is not going as planned they abandon it immediately.  

The second is that they only trade fundamentally solid stocks. These would be things like roku, baba, amd, aapl, crwd.. They would never touch anything like GME or amc.

So i’m in a baba trade right now. Last week I entered around $211 when it looked like it was breaking out. I expected it to fail at 230 because of that massive volume candle on 12/24/2020, it did, and then I sold at 229. 

I entered baba again today, as I believe it will bounce off its previous resistance. I believe that resistance is now support. I entered baba today at $217.05. My stop loss is set at 216. Very, very tight stop loss. If we go below 216 I believe the next stop is 211-ish.

190,DD," Here's some DD for you.

Elon Musk has an incentive package that paid him a significant amount of money, over $50bil, If he was able to hit certain matrices. Part of that was keeping Tesla market cap over a certain amount. I can't remember off the top of my head but I believe it was $650bil for so many months in a row. So he became a master of manipulating the stock price in order to get his incentive bonuses. Deep down I believe this is why he bought Bitcoin. He knew that the company wasn't going to be profitable during the quarter that he bought Bitcoin. So he bought Bitcoin started manipulating it by promoting it through his Twitter account. This enabled Tesla to be profitable and saved him for his bonuses.

Do a quick Google search on Elon musk's incentive plan or read this article below to get more insight on how his pay plan works. Once you understand how it works and you stop to think about the things that he's done you'll understand

A few options:
1. As others have posted, AAPL and MFST are pretty much cash equivalent at this point. Buy and forget

2. SPY

3. Rethink your strategy before you invest in anything

241,KO," Yes, in my opinion. It beats inflation and retains wealth. It does not beat the market average. 


By ""retirement stock"" I mean it has particularly low risk for its below-market return - that's the tradeoff. People in retirement do not want to deal with market volatility. Young folk can deal with volatility; whereas in the later years, we need to retain what we have. 


So yes, it is a possibility. However, depending on your outlook - do you have 20+ years left in you? Do you take care of your physical and mental health? KO is an average company and not a bad choice, but if you are still looking to grow, there are better options even with a simple ETF.

It's just a necessary evil since they aren't bringing in much revenue.  Any good news on their clinical trials usually boosts the stock like you saw with NTLA (which I hold as well).

You should be careful here. Can you explain why in 2017, QYLD was 22.36 at the start of the year and only gave out 1.77 in ""dividends"" for the whole year? That's only a yield of 7.9%. This is because these aren't actual dividends that come from a company, they are profits from CC options trading. What prevents Nasdaq-100 volatility to come down and the yield to come down from around 12% now to 7.9% again?

Past performance doesn't determine future returns, but you don't think one should understand *why* it underperformed in the past to have any sort of prediction about future returns?

>criticism of QYLD and its brethren always seem to assume it's one's only holding

By that logic, why criticize anything? ""I don't want to listen to bear cases of NKLA because it's only 5% of my portfolio"". Criticism of QYLD being a large percentage a portfolio is because of the criticism of being not diversified. Criticism of QYLD itself includes: a lack of understanding of how it achieves that super high yield, only investing in it because of that high yield, super tax inefficient even compared to other high yield securities, opacity of future performance against past performance and similar investments, automatic use of an active risk management tool for passive yield. All of these are risks of QYLD and not understanding them can lead to long periods of underperformance.

If you want to make a case for it then make a case for it. I can show you some scenarios it can be a good idea, it does outperform a non-CC writing benchmark like QQQ if there is a prolonged bear or flat market in QQQ without much volatility, but that's about the only time when holding QYLD is better than QQQ, so investors should know this risk.",tachyonvelocity,1,/r/stocks/comments/od331b/ryld_recovery_time/h3yki7o/,0.103,0.786,0.111,0.7222
