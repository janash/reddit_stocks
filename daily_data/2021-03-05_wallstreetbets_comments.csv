They're going to do everything in their power to make us lose faith. There will be bots. There will be shills. There will be distractions. They are going throw everything at us today. All wet have to do is hold and we win. It's that simple.

**9:37 Update**

They are loading up. They are up to 1,000,000 shares today. This will be one of the biggest battles we've seen in weeks. We are holding around 130.

**9:44 Update**

GME makes the first move. We broke through a barrier that propelled us to 140. We've slowly been declining. Next short update will tell us if the drop is because of shorts.

Remember what matters is not that the price goes down, but rather how many shorts it takes them to go down. We want them depleted and us still in the green.

**9:47 Update**

They are still at 1,000,000 shorts available. The current price fluctuation seems natural. No shorts were bought or sold. Welcome to all the new GME members! Thanks for raising the price! Enjoy the ride!

**10:05 Update**

Shares available are at 1,100,000. We've been hovering around 135 for the past 20 minutes. The jump earlier might have been those 100,000 shorts being bought.

**10:34 update**

I'm at work, so updates happen when I have time. We're climbing! Whether this is natural or because of shorts closing, I don't have that info yet. I will update when I get a chance.

Current price: 147.69

**11:23 update**

Battle lines have been drawn. The Shorting Hedge Investors and Traders attack with 100,000 shorts once GME broke 150. It dropped to below $140 before climbing back up and hovering around 145.

These SHITers probably fear 150 as most of the call options this week would be in the money at that point. Expect another short attack if GME breaks 150 again.

Current price: 145

**12:26 update**

Not much has changed. The SHITers still have 1,000,000 shares available. GME has been hovering around 142. I expect a massive short attack to happen at some point.

Current price: 142.44

**12:33 update**

SHITers are most likely making they're move. GME made a quick drop below 140. The updated short availability will confirm this hopefully within the next 30 minutes to an hour. How low do they want to go? They want to get people to freak out and panic sell. It is currently lunch time for a lot of workers, so this makes sense for the SHITers to attack now.

To those seeing this during lunch, thank you for your interest in my commentary. Please hold and keep you hands and feet inside the vehicle for the duration of your flight. We may experience slight turbulence, but this is normal.

Current price: 139

**12:54 update**

GME hit just above 133 before ascending back up to 137. The 12:45 short availability is still at 1,000,000. Couple of possibilities for the drop could be the SHITers had shorts on hand that they didn't throw into the market, mini panic sell off due to volatility, or the short availability takes some time to properly update. I don't have access to volume so I cant make too many educated guesses.

Current price: 137

**1:08 update**

Nothing major. We're hovering at around 138. Short availability is still 1,000,000 as of 1pm.

Current price: 138.44

**1:50 update**

GME is moving up. As of 1:45, short volume is still at 1,000,000. Gamestop tweeted about same day and next day deliveries. I'm not sure if that actually had an effect on the price or if we're experience simple inflation due to the high short interest. If GME hits 150, I expect another attack down. Let's see what moves the SHITers make in the last two hours.

Current price: 141.62

**2:49 update**

Power hour coming up. If anything happens it'll be soon. We don't know what the SHITers are hoping for price wise, but it seems that they are content with it under 150. Chances are that if something happens, it'll be a short attack towards the end of close. Don't be surprised if we hover around 142 for the rest of the day.

Current price: 141.52

**3:15 update**

This might be my last update before close. Available shorts are still at 1,000,000. We dropped to around 138 and I thought we were seeing another attack, but GME made it back up to 142. No idea how the rest of this hour will go. Enjoy power hour, and realize that a 6-7% gain is a win. I'll make an edit with closing thoughts after hours when I get the chance. 

Current price: 140.37

**4:12 update**

50,000 shares shorted. That was the drop that sent it below 135 before it came back up right before closing bell. The fact that they didn't use the other 950,000 might mean a lot of things, but we won't know for sure until we get more information next week. They might be satisfied with the current price, someone might be out permanently, or they might be playing for a longer fight. Regardless, it's a positive day, and there are still a ton of shorts out there.

Have a great weekend!

I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me.

A day may come when the courage of monke fails,

when we sell our stocks

and break down before liftoff,

but it is not this day.

An hour of wolves and shattered portfolios,

when GME comes crashing down,

but it is not this day!

This day we Hold!!

By all that you hold dear on this good Earth,

I bid you hold, Men/Women of the World!!!

255,DDF," Here is my morning update of my expanded theory that I posted yesterday. I think I may have had a calculation error somewhere, because my values for today are much better.

So below is an expansion of my previously posted theory that we are following the same trend. Note DFF is differential difference factor. The Difference factor is the a comparison of the value from the current run divided by the value from the January run. The DDF is a comparison of the day to day change for the current run divided by the day to day change for the January run.

Closing Values From the January Run Up Compared to March Run Up

1/11/21 / 19.94 || 2/22/21 / 46.00 || Difference Factor 2.31

1/12/21 / 19.95 || 2/23/21 / 44.97 || Difference Factor 2.25 [Day2Day Change -0.01||-1.03; DDF 10300]

1/13/21 / 31.40 || 2/24/21 / 91.71 || Difference Factor 2.92 [Day2Day Change 11.45||46.74; DDF 4.08 ]

1/14/21 / 39.91 || 2/25/21 / 108.73 || Difference Factor 2.72 [Day2Day Change 8.51||17.02; DDF 2]

1/15/21 / 35.50 || 2/26/21 / 101.74 || Difference Factor 2.87 [Day2Day Change -4.41||-6.99; DDF 1.59]

1/19/21 / 39.36 || 3/1/21 / 120.41 || Difference Factor 3.07 [Day2Day Change 3.86||18.67; DFF 4.84]

1/20/21 / 39.12 || 3/2/21 / 118.00 || Difference Factor 3.02 [Day2Day Change -0.24||-2.41; DFF 10.04]

1/21/21 / 43.03 || 3/3/21 / 124.18 || Difference Factor 2.89 [Day2Day Change 3.91||6.18; DFF 1.58]

1/22/21 / 65.01 || 3/4/21 / 132.35 || Difference Factor 2.04 [Day2Day Change 21.98||8.17; DFF 0.37]

**1/25/21 / 76.79 || 3/5/21 (<- we are here)**

1/26/21 / 147.98 || 3/8/21

1/27/21 / 347.51 || 3/9/21

The average difference factor is 2.68, the maximum is 3.07, and the minimum is 2.04. The standard deviation is 0.3772.

The reason I say we are following the January pattern is because of two factors; 1) the difference factor is generally around the average difference factor 2) the day to day changes generally follow the same ""pattern"" as January (on days that had negative change in January, there was negative change now, and this is true for increases and stagnant days).

Previously I assumed a 10% margin of error because I was mostly doing back of envelope calculations only looking at key points. From here on out I will consider the margin of error equal to the standard deviation divided by the average difference factor, which is currently 14.09%. Compared to my calculations from yesterday, the error is now 4% better. Basically we are trending closer to the January pattern, which is **good**! Below are my updated estimates for the price for today and the next few days.

3/5/21 / $205.80 +/-$29.00

3/8/21 / $396.59 +/-$55.88

3/9/21 / $931.33 +/-$131.22

**PEAK VALUE** Previous run / $483.00 || This run / $1294.44 +/-$182.39

The peak value should occur between opening bell March 8th and closing bell March 10th, based off what happened on the January run.

I will be updating this as the next few days progress. Chances are that by Monday my model won't track the current trajectory at all. Luckily, the error is getting tighter so my intuition may be wrong here. That being said, keep my calculations in mind and watch the stock!

- GME is a ""dying mall retailer""

- BofA reiterated their 10$ price target because ""turnarounds are hard""

- They are closing stores -> this must be a bad thing!

They've been getting rid of some slack like unprofitable stores (seriously I love GameStop but do I really need _multiple_ stores in a single mall??) and their old CFO. Interactive Brokers perpetually runs out of shares to lend and despite a two digit increase of stock value GameStop has decided to not issue new shares or pay the CEO millions.

While they can, they are most likely hedging with options.   My guess is that market makers have done that and that‚Äôs why open interest is high.

383,GME," I want to see GME moon as much as everybody else but I keep seeing these posts and I feel the need to explain why this is not going to send the shares suddenly through the stratosphere. 

As part of their legal responsibility for selling these contracts, they buy these shares based on gamma leading up to contract expiry. The closer we are to price and contract expiry, the more shares they have to buy. Since we‚Äôre already talking about contracts that expire Friday and the price is already at/above/near strike price, they most likely already own the shares because they‚Äôre legally obligated to hedge their sold calls before expiry. They‚Äôre not going to be forced to suddenly buy 25% of float tomorrow.

384,GME," Sorry but it‚Äôs clear you don‚Äôt know what your talking about. The price has been steadily around 120 all week. Any contracts with strikes up to 120 will have gotten closer and closer to a delta of 1 as Friday approaches, and MMs are required to maintain delta neutrality, meaning they ALREADY HAVE THE SHARES TO COVER ITM CONTRACTS CLOSE TO EXPIRATION. The only contracts that matter are ones that suddenly become in the money close to expiration, as the MMs will not have FULLY hedged those positions. They will still have partially hedged them for to the volatility of GME.

396,GME," "" In a gamma squeeze,  the price of a stock transiently increases based on an investor buying  many options to drive up the prices of select stocks due to option  sellers needing to hedge their trades on the underlying stocks ""

The price doesnt go up because an option was purchased, it goes up because market makers have to hedge and buy shares to do so once it becomes apparent they are ITM

It‚Äôs a cause and effect though, there has to be huge amounts of options purchased, which creates a situation where covered calls being sold turn into naked calls being sold, they can‚Äôt leave themselves  exposed like that because MM need to stay neutral. This in turn causes them to buy to hedge and cover their ass. In the case of GME if everyone is diamond handing it, a massive uptick in options buying will at some point trigger MM buying shares with a limited supply causing big spikes in price, creating more contracts to be ITM. I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs why we‚Äôve seen big price swings today and last Thursday, if you‚Äôve noticed, there have been some big call purchases near market close both days, I can only assume this is to try to make more contracts ITM the day before expiration.

Now on the other hand, yeah if people exercise call options then it can create more pressure for the following week because MM will have to purchase more shares, but let‚Äôs be honest here, unless someone has been holding cheap ass options like DFV and those shares will only cost him $12 a piece, most people aren‚Äôt going to exercise their contracts, they are gonna take profit where they can. 

I‚Äôm not in anyway looking for an argument, I would love to see multiple gamma squeezes because I‚Äôm currently holding shares in GME. All that being said, those stimulus checks could work wonders if everyone bought super cheap ass deep OTM calls all on the same day. Imagine even a small percentage of WSBers all buying $1400 worth of call options. Even just 10% of members. That‚Äôs 900k people x $1400. 

$1.26 billion in call options would make MM buy shares multiple times over if it all happened in a single day. There‚Äôs your catalyst to start the squeeze of all things squoze.

Lastly I‚Äôll end with this, and this is just my honest opinion- I think gamma squeeze will slow and stock price could start coming down in the coming weeks when the highest strike price is no longer $800. Those calls are dirt cheap, when the highest strike is in the $400s, premiums are obviously much higher. I obviously could be wrong but I think less people will be buying more expensive options.

449,GME," The answers you've gotten are all wrong or greatly simplified. MM's buy based on delta exposure and WILL buy based on the delta of the option in question. A delta of 1 for an option means for every 1 dollar the stock moves the option moves 1 dollar. When an option is well ITM it has a delta of 1. As a option moves ITM the delta increases till it maxes at 1 and moves exactly like the underlying (ie. 1 dollar move in stock = 1 dollar move in contract x100, plus extrinsic value based on the other greeks, like theta which is time value). As far as for a stock this volatile, I'm not sure. MM's may be more careful, but they're still not out to just hold stock around and lose money.

This is why a gamma squeeze requires a fast and UNEXPECTED movement up or down with heavy open interest all the way up or down. Otherwise IV causes options price to ramp up so fast buying drops off unless it's literally rocketing past strikes. Buying high IV you can lose in either direction without serious momentum. 

MMs try to neutral delta hedge. Therefore if for example, if there are 10x MAR19 200C that have a current delta of 0.2 (no idea, just guessing for the example) MMs will NOT buy 1000 shares (100 shares per contract x 10 contracts), but maybe only 200. However, as the 200C come more and more in the money then they will buy enough to continue to stay delta neutral. This means they may hold stock before the option is in the money and liquidate as the chances of it becoming ITM drops (ie delta drops), or pick up more until they own the entire amount of stock to hedge the option at a delta of 1 (in this example 1000 shares at a delta of 1 for 10x contracts). Finally, it takes a stock to be deep ITM or decently ITM plus close to expiration to have a delta of 1. Just cause a contract is 1 cent or even a few dollars ITM doesn't mean it will be delta 1. 

This is why a gamma SQUEEZE, needs to be fast and violent with a lot of outstanding contracts stepwise up the call chain. Any big gap will stop the squeeze. Gamma squeeze are rare because like I said, it has to be fast and unexpected, and a lot of what people called ""gamma squeezes"" have not been. The initial explosion had a gamma squeeze to kick things off and maybe the rise from 40 to 180 seen earlier this month MAY have been a gamma squeeze. 

Regardless, even if tons of open interest and a rising stock price don't SQUEEZE the stock it can still buoy the price and potentially lead to a pretty good run up.

I will say, it seems like if GME rockets there is a good chance of a real gamma again to 200-400, BUT there is a gap on the way to 800 (where there is another large ladder of open interest) AND we need a spark to start the rise.

Edit: I'm not a pro so I'm not sure if all MM's must do this or if it's general good practice or any other considerations that may run counter to delta-neutral hedging.",FTRFNK,179,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxwhpy/gme_possibility_of_gamma_squeeze_just_went/gppq6of/,0.055,0.855,0.091,0.9636

This was the issue in January. A squeeze happened and way OTM calls were suddenly ITM and we had that upward spiral.

627,GME," This night I dreamt China was after me for resisting them when they forcefully took Honkong/Taiwan. I used a tactical tank to hold them off for a while. They thought it was humilliating and wanted me to pay for it.    

Meanwhile I'm sweating like a pig. Both proud for standing with Hong Kong/Taiwan and afraid of what they'll do to my massive dong once they realize how humilliating it is to torture a prisoner with the biggest schlong in all of China.    

Next thing you know, Johannes, an autistic former classmate that has assulted me is in my dreams. But the Johannes I know has an older brother. And boy is he massive like Animal Farms Napolean, tattoos like the bratwa and piercings like an identity crisis. And I felt mighty afraid as he was towering over me.   

In fact I was so afraid that I woke up. Something that Xi Ping in all his dictatorial terrorism couldn't do.     

I guess the old trauma somehow entered my sub consciousness as I have been reducing stimuli the last few days. Stuff like this keeps happening in my dreams.

SSR is a real stock, but these were non-sensical replies to people hyped on GME. Shortly afterward, people realized that the bots/shills/etc. thought they meant $SSR, when people were *actually* discussing GME getting on the short selling restriction list.

Then, this theory was tested by people posting ""$CUM in my $ASS"" and other ridiculous  tickers. I think there was even a stickied ""$CUM megathread"" for an hour.

I read in an report too on Melvin after their losses they told their data scientists to get more information from forums and social media. No doubt they're data mining everything we say.

So from the most mentioned tickers here, their algos buy it instead of short it? Could a possible strategy be that they find mentioned stocks, buy in, use their bots to push these stocks causing retail investors to buy in also pushing up the price, and eventually they reach their level of profit, close their positions and leave retail holding the bag.

While at other side if you calls still far out of money while you believe that stock will reach its target strike price but need more time, you can roll up calls to same strike price but further dates to give you more cushion of theta(time decay). In this case you cough up more money üí∞

1107,RS," Thanks for an actual good reply detailing why you are bearish. All about discussion.

Are Audis overpriced? Yes I agree. But people still eat up the chance the own an Audi from all walks of life. As a sort of status symbol.

Also I do not agree on the featured you claimed are bad on Audi as they are top notch in the industry, there's a reason why people aspire to own one. Which car company are you comparing them to?

Performance wise, you can't go wrong with VW or Audi, with Audi being the more power brand. The basic A1 is a beast of a little car and has some good speed and acceleration for its price and class. Not to even talk about the main line the A/S/RS lines all are at the top of their class. Then the SUVs the Q7 etc are also deemed as luxury and people don't usually regret buying them. The performance is not underwhelming at all, otherwise they would not have the status they currently have.

The VW line still packs a lunch but is cheaper than the more luxurious Audi. 

Regarding security features, I don't see what issues they have? These German cars are great for security.

Also the majority of people I know that own a golf or polo are happy because they say it just works. You get all you need, at a devent price with good features and performance.",zxc369,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lyazhy/why_dont_people_give_michael_burry_more_credit/gpt5iex/,0.009,0.826,0.165,0.9873
1108,IT," Yes, the status is still real, because again they're known to be overpriced so if you can afford them, therefore you must be rich (reality is often very different but that's another story). But if you compare to other expensive cars, Audi's bucks/prestige ratio is far from the best, and that includes Teslas (yes I know they're inferior in interior design but people judge by the cover, not the book). And Teslas are expensive too, despite the recent modest drop in price.

In terms of features, tbh I was shocked when I first tried a Q5 (high-end version, don't remember the exact name though) - IT LOOKS CHEAP AF! Plastics everywhere, nothing innovative, just very basic looking overall. Electronics were very basic (it was in 2018), it didn't park itself, the rear camera definition was worst than my iPhone 3.. I was truly disappointed. A 1990s' BMW or Mercedes does better, and that shouldn't be the case since VW makes enough money to improve and develop new features. Driving and security features were far behind the Volvo I also tried, and slightly behind the BMW X1. 

As of performance: yes A1 is correct, and so is the BM series 1, Volvo T40, and many others in the same range. But for Q3/5/7, no the performance is really not worth mentioning. except if you opt for the much more expensive sport versions (RS). 

My neighbor bought his Golf like 3 months ago and had to bring it back more than 5 times because of electronics defects or bugs in the onboard computer. The vendor told him that these used to be very good and reliable cars, but VW isn't so good with embedded technology.

All in all I am shocked how little they improved over years, especially given the size and resources of VW. But I'm not fingerpointing them really, I think it's the same crap with BMW and Mercedes now. My leasing recently ended and I opted for a more modest brand / car which provides a much better value/$.",esreverengineer_,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lyazhy/why_dont_people_give_michael_burry_more_credit/gptbpar/,0.097,0.779,0.124,0.9132

you think that all of a sudden they are going to be ITM?   IN canada we opened our in the summer,  Hollywood hasnt released a movie in almost 16 months.   You can only make so much showing ghostbusters with social distancing rules.. 

I thin $8/share is dirt cheap if you are long.   But for a quick buck.. thats not going to happen over night.

1271,USA," I agree with you on if they started to do something transformative I'd be way more interested. If you took half of the theater and turned it into a quarter for private rooms for streamers, and a quarter for Esports arenas, I would say okay this might have some growth. Speculatively gaming is a $60 billion market in the USA and over $200 billion world wide. I am not sure what movie you saw recently that you really enjoyed but I can say it's been a long time for me. It seems as if every movie I have seen recently is a revamp of an older movie. Meanwhile I have played several games I thoroughly enjoyed recently. CyberPunk 2077 (yes many glitches, storyline was great though), RDR2, Doom Eternal, Ghost of Tsushima just to name a few and that is just what I enjoyed. Sure some of those games are revamps but at least I feel engaged. I think we are phasing into a new era of media. When I see movie stars being featured in video games it confirms my bias. I think older generations struggle with this concept (29 year old software engineer btw). It also does not help that direct to streaming is cutting out the need to go to the theater. So if there is a movie I do particularly want to see I will get the best seat in the house, my house. And the cheapest best snacks, because they're mine and I bought them cheap at the store of my choosing. Now I feel as if you turn a quarter of a theater into an esports arena and you will bring back crowds like you had for harry potter midnight releases. Keep pushing out trash films like WW1984, Dolittle, Artemis Fowl, and the new Men in Black I will continue to sit in the comfort of my home and play video games.

Sprinkled into the meme were ARKK and ARKG calls. Thank fully sold out of all that weeks ago!

1308,GME," Robinhood has the worst customer support I've ever experienced.  I haven't been able to access my Robinhood account since January.  

I used Robinhood in 2016-2020 but cashed out when Corona hit.  So I have no stocks through it, but cash on my account.  When the GME craze started I went to log on (January) but my account was locked.  The app would not let me recover my password via email, instead it said it could only be recovered via text message, and they would text me a code.

No matter how many times I've tried the text-message password recovery, nothing would get sent to my phone.  I've had the same cell number since like 2006, nothing has changed.  Their phone customer support number is just an automated message saying to log into the app for customer support.  

Finally figured out how to submit an email ticket (this is February now), took them three days to reply and Robinhood Customer support clearly didn't read my email, because their solution to ""the text-password-reset is sending nothing to my phone"" was, ""if you forgot your password, please reset your password via the app.  A text message with a confirmation code will be sent to your cell number.""  Wow, thanks.  That's my fucking problem.

Email them back, three days later they reply with a list of bullshit solutions I've already tried.  Reinstall the app, update android, turn your phone off and on, *log into the app and try to change your phone number* (hmmmm), etc.  Emailed them back saying nothing worked.

Next week get another email asking me to take pictures of my drivers license and social security number and upload them using some third party website.  I thought it was a scam, like I was phished and was not talking to Robinhood at all but some scammer this whole time.  At this point (mid/late February) I was using Webull so my mind wasn't on Robinhood anymore.  I asked them if there was another less-shady way to give them my info.  Idk if they ever responded.

**TL;DR:** Fuck Robinhood.  Webull seems to do everything Robinhood does but better, with the sole exception being it doesn't look like you can buy pennystocks with Webull.",OneRougeRogue,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lyjwq8/robinhood_brand_perception_crashes/gptfnb3/,0.075,0.784,0.141,0.9743

Edit : my own copy pasta from when this happened on Feb 10th

Been trying to figure out if the following is true:

Inspite of reports, Fidelity did not leave GME.

https://fintel.io/so/us/gme

> GameStop Corp. (US:GME) has 490 institutional owners and shareholders that have filed 13D/G or 13F forms with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). These institutions hold a total of 109,434,643 shares. Largest shareholders include Fmr Llc, BlackRock Inc., FDMLX - Fidelity Series Intrinsic Opportunities Fund, Melvin Capital Management LP, Vanguard Group Inc, Senvest Management, LLC, Susquehanna International Group, Llp, Maverick Capital Ltd, Morgan Stanley, and Dimensional Fund Advisors Lp.

My understanding per above quote is that Fidelity has the holding now in their FDMLX - Fidelity Series Intrinsic Opportunities Fund. It used to be In their management and research LLC.

I bought rocket calls last week. On Tuesday my 260$ was 6000$ and I only sold 2 of the calls. Pocketed 1500, next morning they rapidly became fairy dust. 

I sold 2 more for 700 (down 2500$ that morning)

Now I have 4 expiring the 12th and I'm hoping to God they go up. 

I held the bag on gamestop at 80$x130 shares and listened to WSB. 

I deleted my 420.69 limit sells and my 50,000$ gain turned in to a loss for over a month. Gradually sold it all at an average of maybe 100$

1460,AM," I'm gonna chime in here, UWM is my specialty. I'm in the mortgage business, and my company sends most of our loans to UWM.

Today the CEO made a ballsy move. I'm on mobile, so I'll keep it short. But you can look for UWM's Facebook page and watch the live video for more info.

Anyway, he cut his rate prices by about 100 basis points (1% for you apes who don't mortgage). What that means for the consumer is now it'll cost you 1% less to get that rate you wanted. This is great because this past Friday, mortgage rates went up at the federal level, so this helps bring them down again.

Since UWM is the industry-leader in wholesale business, all other lenders are going to follow suit and also lower their rates, so this is a win-win for everybody.

Quick rundown, in order to get a mortgage you have to go to a loan officer. They work either for a broker, or for a retail lender. If they work for a broker, they can shop around for you with lots of different lenders. If they work retail, they can only work with the lender they work with. Nothing wrong with either option. Rocket, however, has both a wholesale and retail channel. You can get a loan with Rocket direct from their website, or you can go to a broker.

Following so far? No? Good.

Now the most ballsy play is UWM fighting Rocket because Rocket is super shady. Rocket claims to be on the broker's side, yet they keep doing things to fuck over brokers. One of those things is Rocket is offering programs for real estate agents to get their loan officer license in 20 days, and in turn, the realtor just needs to send their business directly to Rocket, and they'll pay the realtor for their business. That's shady because if you claim to be helping out brokers, why would you go and do something like that to steal business from them? They also like to take the loans that you submit to them through wholesale, then turn around and steal the client and do a loan for them through their own retail channel, completely cutting out the broker.

Now for those who don't know, UWM is strictly wholesale lending (meaning you need to go to a loan officer who works for a broker to get a loan with UWM), and Rocket has a wholesale and retail channel.

See the conflict? Rocket has two channels, a retail and wholesale. They have two ways to make money. They don't care if they screw over wholesale, because they'll always have another way to make money.

So UWM is saying that brokers who continue to do business with Rocket will no longer be able to submit loans to UWM. Super ballsy, but tons of brokers are already signing addendums to their contract, so now UWM is going to generate even more business.

My broker used to send about an equal number of loans to UWM and Rocket, but now we're ditching Rocket and sticking with UWM (but we still have plenty of other options if we don't pick UWM for whatever reason, maybe a certain loan program, etc.)

Anyway, the tl;dr, UWM lowered costs on rates and is about to generate a TON more business. On top of already being the #1 wholesale lender in the US, they're going to be the #1 wholesale lender on the moon.

I've owned UWM since GHIV, and I plan to hold for years. If this spikes to $20, I'm not selling. This is a long term investment for me.

This is not financial advice, I like the stock. And I really do love UWM. I hate working with Rocket, their underwriters are clueless and their whole system is made for retail (wholesale was always a second idea for them, they even said so themselves.)

1461,CEO," I'm gonna chime in here, UWM is my specialty. I'm in the mortgage business, and my company sends most of our loans to UWM.

Today the CEO made a ballsy move. I'm on mobile, so I'll keep it short. But you can look for UWM's Facebook page and watch the live video for more info.

Anyway, he cut his rate prices by about 100 basis points (1% for you apes who don't mortgage). What that means for the consumer is now it'll cost you 1% less to get that rate you wanted. This is great because this past Friday, mortgage rates went up at the federal level, so this helps bring them down again.

Since UWM is the industry-leader in wholesale business, all other lenders are going to follow suit and also lower their rates, so this is a win-win for everybody.

Quick rundown, in order to get a mortgage you have to go to a loan officer. They work either for a broker, or for a retail lender. If they work for a broker, they can shop around for you with lots of different lenders. If they work retail, they can only work with the lender they work with. Nothing wrong with either option. Rocket, however, has both a wholesale and retail channel. You can get a loan with Rocket direct from their website, or you can go to a broker.

Following so far? No? Good.

I used to work in the data center business in China. It was the exact same concept of retail / wholesale. Retail tends to have higher margins, why it makes sense that Rocket is shifting business over to their own retail. However, wholesale has a shit ton more volume, and more than makes up for the slimmer margins.

If you look at the two companies VNET and GDS, VNET used to be primarily retail focused, while GDS is primarily in the wholesale IDC business. Their clients include Alibaba and Tencent. If you look at their stock price the past few years, GDS has vastly outperformed VNET, meaning investors are giving a much more favorable valuation to the wholesale business. *Edit, I should add that one of the reasons VNET has been performing so well recently is exactly because they're also moving into the wholesale business. It's a main driver of their recent stock price growth. 

Anyway, I know the businesses are completely unrelated, but this is just some insight into another industry's retail vs wholesale business. It might be a sign that UWMC will outperform RKT long-term as well.

1496,AMC, So they failed to deliver them and have to pay interest on them. It was a big win for AMC. But in order to have a gamma squeeze AMC will have to have consistent weeks of high call options volume and high volume of calls expiring ITM. If not I‚Äôd imagine they would continue to short to drive the price down and slowly but surely cover those shares over about a months time which would have very low effect on price actions. AMC really needs option volume and calls expiring in the money to pick up to seize the opportunity it has right now for a gamma squeeze,Outthemud247,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ly4lze/a_class_gamma_squeeze_101/gpre2ak/,0.056,0.818,0.126,0.847
1497,AMC, Yea a lot of OTM calls is what got GME to moon last time. It‚Äôs way more costly for the seller so it‚Äôs applies more pressure on the oppositions end than ITM calls. Obviously there are multiple factors that come into playing with that. It‚Äôs risky  from the stand point of winning because your break even price will be high so there is less of a chance you hit that price by expiration. More likely to expire worthless. But on the other side of that the premium is really low so you don‚Äôt risk to lose a lot of money. So normally what people do when they are expecting a stock might skyrocket like GME or AMC they buy some ITM calls they are confident they can hit before expiration and then some way OTM calls that are really cheap that helps the cause and also benefits them if it does sky rocket.

1501,AMC, That‚Äôs a fact. People are actually holding. That has become very apparent. So no one who‚Äôs holding AMC right now is selling so that‚Äôs good thing. But we need more than that. It would be different if we were trying to short squeeze but no one knows the real % of float shorted. If it‚Äôs high holding a waiting is the best move. But we don‚Äôt know the real short number. It started out as multiple things and it landed on a gamma squeeze attack. But a gamma squeeze needs options being bought and options in the money. It happened last week. Option volume was low this week but we still have a chance today if we get to $9/$10 to have a decent amount of ITM call expire that would help the gamma squeeze. Really need that to happen and really need people to start buying option. We can‚Äôt tell people we are doing a gamma squeeze and all they are doing is buying shares and holding because that‚Äôs not a gamma squeeze. A gamma squeeze it‚Äôs a high volume of options calls which spike the price which in turn helps contracts expire ITM which spikes the price more which domino effects to the moon. People just arent understanding the concept of a gamma squeeze so hopefully this post helps them.,Outthemud247,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ly4lze/a_class_gamma_squeeze_101/gprexeh/,0.052,0.824,0.124,0.9546

Now say for the next few weeks AMC has low option volume and low volume of calls expiring in the money. They just continue to short the stock while slowly delivering those shares over the next month. If they are successful at shorting and we aren‚Äôt successful increasing option volume and calls expiring in the money ITM... they will slowly provide those shares no problem with little action to the price. Only problem they‚Äôll have is if we successfully gamma squeeze them with multiple weeks of options buying and ITM expirations.",Outthemud247,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ly4lze/a_class_gamma_squeeze_101/gpr19d8/,0.095,0.793,0.112,0.5661
1505,GME," I assume all this:

They bought a call option at some point when GME was riding higher, with a strike price of $114. No date info provided.

They watched that call deterioriate as GME dropped from its price at purchase time, and doubled down by buying a heavily ITM (in-the-money) call with a $1 strike price, also no date info given.

My retail smoothbrain assumes the $1 call would be less exposed to downside, still capture some upside, and if they bought it at the right time, could have more than covered the losses on the $114 call as the stock re-approaches/surpasses that strike price. Thus the overall fat gain.

Again, I'm guessing at all of this. The pic shows no options so like, props to OP for exceptional smoothness.

EDIT: It would also explain ppl asking how much the contract was, cause that $1 contract has an intrinsic value of like $10k when GME is at $101, if I'm not confused.

Was wondering why people thought the dividend was relevant. Not sure shorts will jump due to this, but makes sense there should be some upward price pressure here.

I am holding onto my RKT investment (mostly shares and calls for 4/16/21.. and some for 1/2022 and some for 3/19/21) because I agree that it is undervalued and think it can pretty much only go up from here.

1614,GDP," I liked your report. I have a bachelors in economics (what a waste) and the short of the macro economy is there are many variables at play. Sometimes correlations can help identify trends and help with forecasts but it‚Äôs not guaranteed.

I share your sentiments that we should not be worried about hyperinflation at this time. Inflation is tied to GDP, remember the US‚Äô GDP shrank 2.3% in 2020. 

We still don‚Äôt know what life is going to look like post Covid and how it will affect unemployment. People might have changed normal behavior, travel, large entertainment venues, etc and the fallout on complementary service industries restaurants, hotels, etc. 

These actions taken by the fed are a security blanket for our economy to help normalize.

Normalize is a key term. The stonk market the last 18 months has been anything but normal. It may end up being one of the craziest bull markets of our lifetimes. The issue is we are used to massive quick gains (30-1000%) and it has become an addiction. The old standard of a diversified portfolio was 7-10% gains annually. How many people on here would be happen with 10% annually, a very small amount because that is fucking boring!!!!

I have no fucking idea what will happen. My guess is this is a slight correction. It will depend if white collar moves their money to bonds.

Also nice to see a fellow $RYCEY holder. I like the Stonk.  (No idea what will happen with that either don‚Äôt listen to me)",WinOtherwise7423,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ly6b5k/inflation_expectations_part_1/gprjs1o/,0.039,0.823,0.137,0.9773

Yea this sucks but I‚Äôve watched my money double and didn‚Äôt take any profits the whole time. That‚Äôs because I believe this company is going higher than 44$. 


Same thing happened to me a few years ago with CGC and the Canadian pot boom, I watched the stock get wiped out but I bought all the way down. I eventually made a nice chunk of change. This feels no different to me other than I believe this is way under valued.

1802,PII," I once had an idea like this. When it was announced a few years ago that Shure was discontinuing the M44, the most popular DJ stylus, I found the last website that still had them in stock for normal retail and bought 5 of them @ $80, then put the package on a shelf untouched. M44s now list on eBay for 2x-5x what I paid for them. I figure I'll sit on them a while longer, the pandemic lockdown can't have been kind to the rave DJ stylus market.

On a personal note: Dammit, dammit, dammit. I can't reveal PII but a very long time ago I was once closely connected to a Dr Seuss fan club, one that counted some of the biggest progressives and lefties I've ever met among its membership, and we staged public readings of those books in front of huge audiences, including some of the ones that are now being criticized. I was a huge progressive at the time too, 'lefties' is not a perjorative. I haven't looked at them in ages, I can't and won't comment on the validity of the claims, but this is news I sure didn't expect to hear. The whole thing was good fun and until this evening nothing but a very fond memory for all concerned.

1812,GME," I can definitely confirm that I was in way too deep the first time GME popped. I was having anxiety like I've never felt before, losing sleep, cold sweats, stomach aches, grumpy, sad, all of it. It started while GME was on the rise, but wasn't too bad, and then got awful when it was coming back down.

The Market is ridiculously hot. Only buy that are reasonably valued compared to 1 year ago - and a small speculative bets (and gamestop, but that is a story for another day). For tech, buy things like DBX or FB. Other than that, buy stuff that is considered defensive like consumer staples. I missed the train on oil - though that might go up another 50% ... no idea. Get a gold miner or two, apparently inflation is good for the gold price. ... And get other industries that pretty much did not move last year. There are reasonable stocks that are still down from the March crash!

Anyways, yesterday was +- 0 for me. I hope that I can ride these picks up as they get rediscovered  (or at least not get trashed) and then I can dump them in the Summer and jump on a cheaper Nasdaq. In my heart, I believe those growth/tech stocks are the future. The problem is, most of them are prized 5-10 years ahead.
