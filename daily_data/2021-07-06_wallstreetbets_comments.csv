*11 distinct pics, 11 weeks of flat trading*


For a couple months now I have been theorizing the idea of quarterly spikes in GME price related to quarter end options. You can view my profile for my 2nd to last post to see details, here is a summary:

Jan 14 expiration
Apr 16 expiration 
July 16 expiration

Jan 14 led to a spike approx 40 days later from feb 24-March 10. We then traded flat/down for 11 WEEKS!!

*this method disregards the huge spike in the end of January as a legitimate gamma squeeze that got out of control of market makers and forced them to turn off the buy button.

TLDR: DFV went completely radio silent since this tweet. 11 distinct pics. It matched our 11 weeks of flat from March-May and we are on track since June 9 in our 5th week since.",adventuresofjt,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oesywr/gamestop_continues_expansion_of_fulfillment/h49fnsy/,0.041,0.943,0.016,-0.5696

544,WISH," My dawg you did such a good write up but missed a key point of the RSU fuckup. It seems like the CFO fucked up the vesting date and therefore created a massive tax liability which none of the employees had cash to pay therefore the massive selling pressure we have likely been seeing since IPO is all the employees shares being liquidated to pay the tax. This means the depressed price is probably just a technicality and will recover strongly from here.

Also, very important practical and significant benefit of being granted Payment Institution (PI) licence is ability to generate individual IBAN format accounts for their clients. This allows PI to be as a bank and do not require additional account with commercial bank. Euro payments can be processed instantly and at low cost. PI does not need to pay commissions to the intermediator commercial banks (which means significant costs savings as each bank transaction is charged by certain % per value). This makes basically PI equal to the banks in EUR payment processing.

Also, capital gains tax. Not sure how long op has had the stock. 

By selling the put the gain is fixed. And it’s opening a new position. Whereas, op is already in the trade at a real good cost basis. I’m sure the premium will be juicy on the CC. 

A credit put spread would be a better use of capital if the stock doesn’t dip. If it dips you have a fixed loss but I’d rather sell a Csp and end up owning the stock than a put credit spread. But a put credit spread is a better use of capital  but you can end up with nothing but a loss.

757,AI," the shortage issues massively massively hurt AMD. Without it, it would have shown higher YoY growth and faster marketshare growth in datacentre/HPC. Its fucked AMD a lot. We could have been 105 now instead of 95. TSMC expansion in the US along with Intels drive to expand into foundry leaves a lot of possibilities for AMD. Its not super clear that its a slam dunk win for AMD. Its more moving parts in the future whereas we prefer less moving parts with current competitive advantage.

NVDA is kicking AMD's ass inside out on GPU and hardware acceleration in datacentre/AI. We just have to accept it as it is. NVDA is something you should also look to get into when the price isnt so stupid. AMD is not NVDA though. Dont expect those price levels. NVDA has a fucking stranglehold in market sectors that AMD does not have.

AMD is however takings Intel's lunchmoney on x86 and its mainly because Intel fucked up on EUV. Intel's comments on ""chiplets glued together""? Well those chiplets glued together are what allow AMD to make much better yields on smaller die sizes. When a wafer has an issue, you lose a lower portion of the wafer if you have smaller dies, or chiplets. So now AMD has several years lead on making chiplet designs talk to eachother faster or more efficiently.

Intel is however throwing in the towel and going to pay for EUV by TSMC in 2023. AMD has advance plans for 2023 with TSMC anyway and think they are second customer behind Apple so should be on a more even playing field moving forward in 2023, with the advantage of maybe 5 years with infinity fabric and chiplet design instead of monolithic dies. However if EUV pellicles come good by then, monolithic dies may be better - cant tell.

When a wafer has an issue, you lose a lower portion of the wafer if you have smaller dies, or chiplets. So now AMD has several years lead on making chiplet designs talk to eachother faster or more efficiently.

Intel is however throwing in the towel and going to pay for EUV by TSMC in 2023. AMD has advance plans for 2023 with TSMC anyway and think they are second customer behind Apple so should be on a more even playing field moving forward in 2023, with the advantage of maybe 5 years with infinity fabric and chiplet design instead of monolithic dies.

Kudos to NVidia for not slacking off when no competition was in sight, but quite simply we don't know what's going to happen when real competition enters the data center space. It hasn't happened before, so we don't have a lot of data to work with. A lot of the deployments are new, running new software, not upgrading legacy x86 systems.

Here's the comparison for i9-11900K vs Ryzen 9 5900X. Same [results](https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/AMD-Ryzen-9-5900X-vs-Intel-Core-i9-11900K/4087vs4110). With intel performing 10% better than the AMD counterpart and cheaper as well.

That said, it's still worth a 50% increase in their capacity over their last biggest battery, so that's still huge.

825,AI," 1. Not going to see cars with Solid-state batteries for a few years still
2. Battery swapping will force them to expand these pricey stations that are expensive to run and maintain. They should never have gone with battery swapping. They want to move away from that, but you have tens of thousands of customers who will be very upset if you stop building out the swap stations.
3. Driving computer and hardware... Without the software and proper AI training you are not going to make a system like Tesla. Also, China is not known for doing software as well as the US, so maybe don't pin your hopes on a Chinese company to achieve with software what Tesla can.
4. Saying you provide service versus being able to service a growing user base are two different things.
5. Ummm... in 2020 about 1/5th of Tesla sales (not 30-40%) were in the Asian market.
6. In terms of quality, since NIO is in China, you should know that Tesla's made in China scored top scores for quality. Also, Tesla is opening soon two new huge factories. For anyone that has followed Tesla, it is clear that quality should improve in the new factories as compared to the production lines in Fremont. For one, Tesla is going to use more single casts which inherently make the cars able to meet tighter tolerances. Secondly. the new production lines will allow for greater flexibility in shutting down and making needed changes that Tesla lacks in Fremont now.
7. NIO is trying to expand in a world that is less forgiving for EV's than when Telsa was doing this four years ago (roughly the similar place NIO is now, I think). Tesla being the first mover has benefitted from better margins than anyone showing up now can command. With NIO, they may be able to raise money and keep on expanding, but they will not have the necessary margins and they will keep on hitting a cash shortfall and if at some point they can't keep on raising funds, they will ultimately fail. Basically, take a company that is attempting to copy Tesla but with worse cash flow.

Maybe  stock goes up, maybe not. Long-term, NIO is a huge risk in a world with an EV company like Tesla already.

857,ICE," Cars make up a miniscule amount of the pollution in China. Industry and energy generation are the problems in China and have nothing to do with getting rid of ICE. Their strategy for that is loading up on nuclear and solar, which is a good strategy that does not need EV adoption at all.

Whether or not Nio does well has nothing to do with their plans for reducing their environmental impact.

Clov had a squeeze a month ago, and you should have sold then. Now it is still fine as a long term holding, because the fundamentals of the company are strong. But its likely not going to short squeeze anymore because the volume is too low.

Great growth and a lot of the customers are pretty hardcore fans (check the FB groups for example).

I use SoFi to buy SoFi because I heard I like SoFi.

1110,FSD,"  Model 3s of 2019 come with AP2.5, whereas new updates like this needs AP3. It has nothing to do with FSD. The sensors are there. It's just that the processing unit is faster in newer generations.

Buying FSD does not only allow you to use FSD, but also guarantees you of any hardware update needed to maintain FSD until the EOL of the car. That's why the price goes up each year and that's why they wanted to link this option to only the original buyer.

1127,ADM," I do get it.  APPH's goal is to scale up farming ASAP and then find other revenue streams like SaaS.  Agrify just does SaaS.
