0,BK," No that doesn't makes sense.  If you don't know what correlation coefficients are please read up on them.  

Basically, in statistics it is a measure how much one thing moves against another thing.  It is measured on a -1 (perfect Indirect correlation) to 0 (no correlation to +1 (perfect direct correlation) and everything in between.  

That means if something goes zig and the other goes zag by the same amount it is a C.C. of -1 (stock A goes up +10% stock B goes down -10%).  If something goes zig and the other goes zig as well that is a C.C. of +1 (stock A goes up 10% and stock B also goes up 10%).

SO go to ""portfolio [vizualizer.com](https://vizualizer.com)"" and plug in spy (sp500 etf) and BK (berkshire hathway) and look at its C.C.  Anything above .8 is very high.  Especially look at the years of the bear markets (00-02, 08-09, and last year) to see how they both do in times of crisis.  My guess the c.c. will be near +1.0.  That means in times of crises the both go the same direction and unfortunately that is down the tubes!  That only makes sense since they both invest in U.S. large cap companies (more or less).  

BTW, an asset that goes up when a stock goes down (high negative correlation) is termed a ""hedge"" in finance theory.  Finding an asset that goes up when stocks go down is the HOLY GRAIL of investing.

5,SNP," I do not think that Berkshire makes for a good hedge against risk with how closely they follow (and have recently underperformed) the SNP 500. They'd probably capture just as much of the downturn as the snp 500 would, so it wouldn't really work that well as a hedge.

At the same time, their recent investment choices aren't necessarily optimal and one wonders whether they'd use their cash reserves to grandiose effect - they are in a great position to buy the dip after all and in a ...very creatively abstract sense you could say that that's a ""hedge"".

No offense to these legends, but Munger and Buffet are 90 and basically 100 years old at this point in time. You watch interviews with them and Warren basically has, from 2008 until today, only barely learned how to bring up an SMS on his smart phone, in fact, he still doesn't know.

There's a somewhat memorable quote from him regarding the situation when he was being asked to help with funding where he said. *""I got a text message and I didn't know how to read it.""*

He says he doesn't know any tech, and it's good he stuck to what he knows, but he has also refused to learn for more than 30 years now; and I don't believe in the slightest old dogs can not learn.

It's an understatement to say they haven't gone with the times. They're both extremely out of touch regarding certain things, and that's certainly fine, but doesn't necessarily make them the ideal people to make investment choices in 2021/22 if you want average or above average performance. Hadn't they had Apple, they'd been screwed, and that wasn't even his idea.

Warren is great at getting three free puffs out of dumpster cigars, but poor-ish as a mega-investor.

People can only get so fat and drink so much coke and eat so much peanut brittle; they love those businesses but it's not a sector that can keep growing forever - just like the already very swollen American people.

Honestly I'd say: If Berkshire drops due to the news of his death, I'd buy it because I strongly believe I'd be getting value + vastly superior management, but I really believe that this play of yours literally only work after Munger and Buffet - and since they will never retire - have died.",Lilith_LaVey,1,/r/investing/comments/p3wy3m/what_do_you_think_of_berkshire_stock_as_a_hedge/h8y7xxt/,0.052,0.778,0.171,0.9951

7,BHE," The problem for BRK is that the market values the company at book value + float. All of their operating businesses (GEICO, BNSF, BHE, etc) are thus valued collectively at around PE 15. If the valuation of their operating business would've been subjected to the same multiple expansion as the market, then BRK would've outperformed. However this is a moot point since the market continues to value BRK at book value + float, which is how one would value a simple straightforward insurance company.

edit: my point being is there isn't much Buffet can do against the multiple expansion of the market when their operating business cannot take part of that expansion",michelco86,2,/r/investing/comments/p3wy3m/what_do_you_think_of_berkshire_stock_as_a_hedge/h8wzk1z/,0.023,0.849,0.128,0.8885

This looks like Series A so you would need to have a relatively longer timeframe - at least 5 years. And you are mostly betting on the current team - from what I can tell, the company currently has about 10 employees including the management.  

Personally, I wouldn't try to stock pick unless I know the management and I can acquire shares through other means.

16,IMO," >The market is efficient and no one can reliably outperform the market over time on a risk adjusted basis except by luck

We know this is wrong.   Several institutional investors have outperformed the market.  

Looking to mutual funds and hedge funds to test for outperformance is a mistake.  These funds can't control buying and selling because investors buy and sell the funds on a daily basis, forcing the fund to buy and sell at inopportune times.  

Furthermore, if you spend a few months reading reddit investing threads, you'll see immediately why the average investor fails to outperform the market: they use investment strategies that are certain to fail, investing disproportionately in unproven technologies and low margin businesses. 

You didn't mention growth investing.  IMO that's by far the best chance to outperform the market.",hendrix_srv,1,/r/investing/comments/p44n7w/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h8y0nsg/,0.135,0.771,0.094,-0.6467
17,PB," Thanks for your reply! I agree with your post, including your point about growth investing. I would add that the traditional definition of value investing as buying low PE and low PB stocks is not a very good definition.

That's a worse demographic picture than China has. I can't see some 30 year old all of a sudden getting super into wrestling. The fans are people who grew up with Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, Ric Flair and the attitude era fans after that with Stone Cold, Undertaker, the Rock.

It will then move to an island in the middle of the ocean where full contact wrestling will take place. So the stock will jump with the initial sale, it will climb when “real” wrestling is announced, then it will dip when it moves back to scripted except for PPV, finally it will climb strongly when the first few PPV events take place to finally completely tank when all the talent is either dead or has a broken neck.
