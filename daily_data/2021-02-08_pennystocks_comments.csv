1,DD, This is giving me serious fomo and a bit of envy. But kudos to you on hitting it hard and taking the risk. Right now I'm just trying to max out my TFSA and RRSP which are like the Canadian equivalent to the 401k. If anyone's in Canada and knows how to go about buying otc please feel free to reach out.

3,DD," This. You put a significant amount of money in a $0.10 stock. It goes to a dollar, you are in great shape. It goes to $0.05, you’ve lost half your investment. Guess which one is more likely? 

Also, you should be wary of the macro environment. Stocks are growing basically everywhere and have been for years. If there is a major downturn while you are holding penny positions, you could easily lose your investments. I would say we are overdue for serious downturn, but also, there’s nothing saying it’s going to happen soon. This is gambling, even with DD. DD only mitigates risk. You got a 47% to double your money at a roulette table inside 5 seconds. Are the stocks you pick better odds?

9,ATH," A couple of people here have brought up a good point. It looks like they were at $60 a share about four years ago, and then went to basically a penny stock after a few scandals. The share price went way down in Sept/Oct after a lawsuit was announced. 

Probably two possibilities- 1. the cost of the suit will hurt their prices and keep them from reaching their potential or  2. the prices will continue to go up towards their ATH (but probably quite a bit lower).

They would have had needed the kiosks already manufactured and ready to go at that point. Nearly five THOUSAND of them.  I know for sure they'd use Covid as an excuse, so I've factored that in.

In another pro INND post, someone claimed they sell high tech, new age hearing aids. The ones they have on [Walmart.com](https://Walmart.com) are identical to the same ones my Grandfather has worn for 15+ years.  They have a total of a whopping 15 reviews.

WDH partnering with Philips. They all have remote fine tuning and other functionality as standard now which will allow for greater support in the DTC space.

On top of that you have a lot of similar functionality likely to come into future iterations of galaxy buds and apple buds.

193,DD," Recently former dental equipment guy chiming in...

I sold a decent amount of lasers over the last two years. Biolase has an interesting dust up with their former exclusive distribution partner (several years ago) and while their product has some solid word of mouth and price point, I don't know that it has the sex appeal of some of their competitors. The laser market is interesting for all the reasons stated by others in this thread however, my takeaway is that dental is somewhat of a niche market. I am more comfortable investing in a company that has a broader consumer base. 

It would be interesting to see some DD on their sales data for the past 5 years and see how much of their revenue is from people trading up/trading in their existing Biolase product for a new/updated version. Their all tissue laser looks promising but it might be late to market as Solea is the standard there: [http://www.convergentdental.com/solea/](http://www.convergentdental.com/solea/)",Biddipbo,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/lfd7vm/biol_dd_stocks_with_frickin_laser_beams/gmlhrzd/,0.0,0.922,0.078,0.8045

198,BIOL," Wow so much to unpack, first off, maybe do research. Just because you're in school for dental hygiene (not even dental school), doesnt mean you know what you're talking about in regards to soft tissue procedures.

Speaking as someone who just had their newborn infant get their upper and lower lip frenectomy done with a laser instead of the ""established hand instruments"", you're wrong about several things:

1. Initial healing speed of laser treatments is much faster, although they both heal eventually to the same point, the laser heals faster. The pain is less severe both initially, and over the first 3 weeks, which are the most crucial. Especially when you're talking about things like frenotomy for infants, where you have to physically stick your hands into their mouth and force their tongue to stretch in various ways to avoid reattachment, and you have to do this for weeks. When you're doing this on a procedure performed with the hand tools, the chance for rupturing and causing bleeding is WAY HIGHER than it is with a laser. We only saw a tiny spot of blood on the very first day, after that, nothing. And he was fully healed by 3 weeks. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347729620\_Evaluation\_of\_Pain\_Perception\_and\_Wound\_Healing\_After\_Laser-Assisted\_Frenectomy\_in\_Pediatric\_Patients\_A\_Retrospective\_Comparative\_Study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347729620_Evaluation_of_Pain_Perception_and_Wound_Healing_After_Laser-Assisted_Frenectomy_in_Pediatric_Patients_A_Retrospective_Comparative_Study)
2. PPO covers laser treatments, I know this because mine covered my sons, and the more ubiquitous they become the more covered they will be. Also, they're not even expensive as far as dental procedures go, even if we paid out of pocket it was going to be $450 per procedure with the laser.
3. This is not a reason not to invest in the future. And this is also why BIOL entered into a deal with a dental network to help get lasers into more offices, this will have a domino effect and offices that do not offer the laser procedures will begin to fall by the wayside unless they catch up.
4. They definitely haven't, if it were true, it would actually be a counterargument to your own claim in #3. I live in a very technologically forward area in SoCal, and even here we only had 4 dental offices spread across our county that offered the laser procedures.
5. Nothing to say about this as I know nothing about teeth whitening.

I have no position in BIOL.",ZoibyWantBuyOnMargin,15,/r/pennystocks/comments/lfd7vm/biol_dd_stocks_with_frickin_laser_beams/gmlc5q1/,0.039,0.902,0.059,0.8221

245,CBD," Tickers I mostly saw here and researched this weekend:

I think this market is mostly driven on momentum and emotion... you could argue that all the tickers mentioned here have some of both in their favor. Even still, a lot of these companies don't look good if you peel back the cover.

BBRW: good press in the last couple months, but nothing very recent. Good revenue (almost $1m per quarter) and diverse offerings. Not a lot of free cash, but that seems to have always been true and they are making it. I secretly want to run a brewery someday, so I have a soft spot for their market. I'm in

TSNP: $113k in revenue in first 9 months of 2020 and they are now a $5b company? I don't buy it. I'm not in

OZSC: 247k revenue in quarter but COGS of $271k. Could be an emerging investment. But market cap of $763m? I'm late - I'm out.

BRLL: The most recent filing I found was for 2019, when they had $9 in cash and in the previous quarter tracked $182 in bank overdraft liabilities. Seriously? This is a $10m company? I'm out

SNPW: 88k in revenues in 3 months, and a $116m market cap - I think I'm too late on this one. I'm out

SIML: Modest revenue, emerging industry interests (cannabis), low market cap of \~$5m, recently announced a $3m deal, active and current filings. Passes my smell test, I'm in for a bit

ENZC: Very cool tech and news - new binding sites identified for HIV, working on COVID now; I think I'm late on this one - they are over $1b market cap. I'll probably try a small investment

GTEH: I like the news they're generating on CBD coffee and other markets. From their recent filing: ""...the Company has incurred continuous losses from operations, has an accumulated deficit of $9,779,976, has a negative working capital of $2,356,588 and has cash on hand of $111,613 as of October 31, 2020, and has generated minimal revenues to date."" That's bad. But revenue in the quarter of \~$250k and a low market cap, makes it a risky play but a momentum play.

That means your looking at posts that look boring, there isn't much going on and the company's price is either stagnant or declining. Just pick any rocketing stock right now and look back to when  it was flat. There is a lot of risk in this as there might not be anything going on at all or it might suddenly crash.

AABB is a good example it was declining for a few weeks with a post every few days and today its up some and testing higher daily highs. ABML is growing slowly but only a % or two a day. This is a good time to hope in before movement happens.

You can also take some risks based on price. Today I bought 175k shares of FHBC because the financials are good, it is making a product and they are working hard right now on distribution deals. This might sit for a month or two but at less than $300 investment I can do that. AT $0.0017 it doesn't have to move very much for me to make my money back plus some.

through its presentation of the superior pharmacokinetic data documented from two previously completed pre-clinical trials and was granted approval by the BSL-4 facility to commence this trial in late February 2021.

So I don't like that at all, there's no reason it HAS to be at a BSL-4 facility, they're apparently doing an animal study, so they only need BSL-3. 

Maybe their PR person fucked up, and their trial is actually at Tulane which is where all their professors are (and they have a BSL-3 facility there), but they seemed pretty explicit in the press release.

What is a warrant you ask...

Most stock warrants are similar to [call options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp)  in that they provide the holder the right, but not the obligation, to  buy shares of a company at a specified price (strike price) before the [warrant](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/warrant.asp) expires. [Unlike a listed option](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/stock-option-warrant.asp), a warrant is issued by a company instead of an option writer.

You can read more about them here on [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/how-to-exercise-stock-warrants/).

I'll also add, I've read all this multiple times myself. I don't think I fully understand how it works. I'm not sure why a warrant can be traded like a stock, when it gives you the option to gain the stock that is at a higher price. The whole thing seems odd to me. Which makes me think I'm missing some key part to the whole thing. Because if you can buy the warrant for $0.30 and then instantly turn it into a stock worth $1.47, why are those people holding a .30 warrant not just converting and selling.

476,AMP," Working in Digital Marketing, AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) are annoying as fuck. It was all the rage a few years ago when a few years ago when they tried to tell people that sites with non-AMP pages were going to de-prioritized for Google SEO. It's basically a stripped down mobile-only version of a webpage.",aMAIZEingZ,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/lfbzc2/tonix_pharmaceuticals_tnxp_to_develop_covid19/gmmjxu5/,0.173,0.827,0.0,-0.8689
477,AMP," there are even reddit bots which convert amp links to the normal links. Looks like they're not active on this subreddit though. Here's one for example: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmputatorBot/comments/ehrq3z/why_did_i_build_amputatorbot/

AMP links can be tricky to detect because the one you posted above is the obvious one, where it directly points to google.com. But some companies these days want to have the higher search ranking that comes with it, so they'll completely integrate AMP into their website. THis way you'll actually see the server that you want to contact in the url, but internally, that server is simply loading everything from google. You'll see this if you use your browsers network traffic tab. In the url you will only see this as something like https://amp.somenewspaperwebsite.com or https://somenewspaperwebsite.com/some-article/amp

if like me, you have a browser addon that blocks tracking scripts and ads, AMP scripts that secretly load everything from google anyway, might be blocked. If google detects this, they sometimes use a css trick to just give you a blank white page for about 8 seconds, before finally redicting you to the original website. That's their way to punish me haha (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21714264)",Type-21,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/lfbzc2/tonix_pharmaceuticals_tnxp_to_develop_covid19/gmlm6vi/,0.068,0.845,0.086,0.5677

480,PKG," Look at the fundementals, look at the catalysts. It's not a pump and dump. It's had huge spikes followed by consolidation and support builds aka it's had organics growth. 

If you want to look at one aspect of the fundementals, look to the pkg acquisition. 

It's estimated PKG had $30mm in revenues BEFORE their new contracts and CleraMask in 2020 and ~$70-100mm after. The market cap on $CBBT is showing $32.25 mm on my broker and $100mm on OTC site.

483,PKG," People will lie to drive prices down, unless someone produces a clear and coherent argument it's just bashing. The acquisition of a company that specializes in the design and production of human interfacing systems speaks for itself in what they all believe can be done.

Industry experts often dismiss revolutionary technology and treatments in their own fields because it's something they're not used to or doesn't fit the mold of something they expected. What I see is a company (PKG) who has been around 30+ years in this area, successfully driving their business with the products they develop and generating $20MM+ in revenues telling us they think this can work. So you can listen to internet arm chair experts or just observe what's actually occurring, these business are putting themselves on the line for this chance.

Regardless, PKG/CBBT have a heck of a lot more going for them other than this, 90% of the investments most of you are making in the OTC/Pinks is in companies that have *no revenue at all*, and that's is stratospherically huge thing to recognize. People go nuts over FDA approvals but don't realize how much longer it takes to go from there to revenue and how much debt is accumulated in the process. This company acquires into a position of having a well established business and revenues over night. There will be an actual budget for R&D and there won't need to be any major dilution to work through this process.

488,OUT," Don’t have a ton of time to type this out but my key issues are:

1) The whole basis for this technology and the study you mentioned is that Alzheimer’s is caused by decreased cerebral blood flow. This is not proven nor commonly accepted in medicine. It’s only an alternative unproven hypothesis.

2) Let’s say that the hypothesis is true (I doubt). In that case perhaps VEGF in the brain could help. Ok, maybe. If it caused the right effect in the right region of the brain. So now you have omentum transplant into the brain hypothesis. That’s a small study, and there haven’t been many of any subsequent studies. What does that tell you about what scientists think about the results?

3) Even assuming the omentum transplant thing works (I doubt), stimulating the omentum in the abdomen and hoping that VEGF is released into the systemic circulation, survives the trip to the brain, crosses the blood brain barrier, and causes angiogenesis to promote increased perfusion in the right areas without causing havoc all over the rest of body are all unproven leaps.

I just bought  $ZOM and $SNES for 100$ total. Those are my ""playmoney"" that i am willing to loose just to learn basics on how to trade. I've read other people's DD about these two pennystocks (since i'm too noob to make my own), and i choose those because i see a potential. I am not a intraday trading person, so i'm planning to keep those for a few days or even weeks and exit when i feel ""satisfied"" with my gain or loss. Is this a fair way to treat those kind pennystocks? Mid term trading (or whatever is not day trading) makes sense with pennystocks? Or should i aim to some other kind of stocks? To recap : low budget, no intraday / no long term, and as i said before, what  am i doing now is litteraly ""playing"" to learn.",whelpling,4,/r/pennystocks/comments/lf3xcr/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gmlq085/,0.096,0.797,0.106,0.6712

Hey guys,

Sadly I forgot the name of a Canadian gold mining company that is set to explode in the next two years. All I know is the following:

1. I remember they are active in Canada as well as Australia.
2. Their areas are in the neighborhood of areas where a lot of gold has been found already.
3. They started their second phase drilling in August 2020
4. Their stock price is a steal right now.
5. It is a Canadian gold mining company

I would be so glad if anyone could help me out. Thank you already in advance guys.

In the 9 months ending 9/30/2020, they had less than $4,000 in cash, and $140k in AR (money other people owe them). They had total liabilities > $500k, including over $50k on credit cards.

In those 9 months, they had total sales of $113k but COGS (how much they spent, e.g. on labor, to earn that money, not including sales or officer pay) of $74k - respectable, but it leaves only $40k for other expenses to grow the company.

Over those 9 months, they spent $1,033 on sales.

Now they have 4.5 billion shares of stock and a market cap of over $5 billion dollars.

Do those add up? Would you trust someone who maybe did an awesome job managing a $1,000 sales budget with $5 billion dollars?

625,OCGN," They are selling 3 million shares directly to big institutional investors at a price of $7.65. 

Because the price is quite high, it’s bullish. It means that institutions are paying $7.65 to get in on OCGN right now, which indicates that there’s a perceived upside from that price. It goes against all of the people who said this would dump back to $5. 

In the short term, sometimes offerings cause dips. This is less likely to do so because it’s direct (meaning OCGN is selling direct to institutions) offering. 

Public offerings are different and usually involve dilution, issuing more shares, etc. Those can be less bullish, especially in the short term.",bluelemoncows,11,/r/pennystocks/comments/lf310o/for_those_of_you_in_ocgn/gmke06d/,0.023,0.938,0.039,0.2023

725,DD,"  Re-pasting my DD on $SING (SinglePoint) from another thread. This has made a slight run up over the last week, closed at 0.04 on Friday, but in my opinion there is still legs on $SING to run up over the next couple of weeks (current market cap is only about US$50 million).

\- Company's latest presentation can be found here: [https://www.singlepoint.com/downloads/singlepoint-presentation-jan-2021.pdf](https://www.singlepoint.com/downloads/singlepoint-presentation-jan-2021.pdf)

\- Basically, SinglePoint is set up as an investment vehicle, management identifies and acquires companies, recent acquisitions are in the **solar, EV charging and weed sectors**, all of which are good businesses and well-positioned to grow in current general macro and political climates.

\- Latest revenue reported by company has grown significantly (+15% year on year from 9M 2019 to 9M 2020)

\- Company recently removed all convertible notes from its balance sheet, significantly reducing dilution overhang for the stock, benefitting shareholders like us

\- Company's solar installation business appears to be one of the best in town. Gross profit margins on the solar business is \~30%, very much higher than competitors. Large-cap Solar Alliance and SunRun's gross profit margins are at 21% and 23% respectively. Another penny stock $SIRC (which I am also bullish about) has gross profit margins of 26%. $SING's margin's are certainly top notch.

\- Solar's in the trend right now, because of Biden's policy stance. Solar installation businesses will grow very quickly due to increased demand in residential installation. Panel installation businesses such as Solar Alliance, SunRun and $SIRC will continue to grow. So will $SING.

\- From a valuation multiple perspective, these 3 businesses above (Solar Alliance, SunRun and $SIRC) are currently trading at an average of \~45x EV/Revenue. If you apply this 45x multiple on $SING, you can expect at least 30% more upside to the current share price of 0.04. And this 30% upside is not even considering that $SING still has EV Charging and Weed businesses, as well as other future acquisitions!

\- In terms of management team, the team appears to know what they're doing. From its official Twitter account, it announced on Jan 13 that it had entered into a Letter of Intent to acquire EnergyWyze. Just less than a month later, on Feb 3, it announced that the acquisition has been completed. Completing the transaction in such a short span of time points to a highly competent and efficient team which is good news for steering the company forward in their future acquisitions.

\- Near term catalysts: Any new acquisitions announced (very likely due to the fact that the business model of the company is based on new acquisitions and portfolio companies), short term news on EV Charging and Solar industries

If it fills, it fills. If not, don't chace because a lot of time it will bounce back down for a second. Long way of saying, if you are putting market orders and they aren't letting you, good, put in a set limit order.

817,DD," Understanding things like balance sheets, estimated EPS/actual earnings blah blah blah is going to take some time. The key basic thing you can look into for long-term investment or if you think you will make any gain is looking at the most current PR, and digging into the company online. Here are some questions: do they have any social media presence? Website up to date? Have they moved from one product to another... like was a mineral company now a weed company? A lot of pennies will fake press release for pump and dumps. Take a look at  ELCR (Electric Car Company Inc)... it’s last real news was 10-11 years ago but it’s stock has recently moved up. There is no solid presence online, so you can see after doing your DD if someone is trying to hype a stock online but you look at see nothing... it is most likely a pump and dump. Meaning someone will invest thousands along with most likely a few others so new investors like yourself fall for it and throw in your cash only to see them pull out when there is a spike in gain. Now look at a stock like SIRC, question why that stock has made a good run these past 2 weeks. You can start with looking at at their PR. And yes, too many “to the moon” post lately. 
Good luck. 
I think a stock to do DD that is still low is HITIF. It is one of my long-term picks but I think it has good solid info out there for you to decide if it’s for you or not. If not, I say just look into it to see how to compare other stocks your eyeing as in how you researched the company and not rely on forums.

Not saying base your decision on press release or websites alone but that’s a good sign that the company is actually making moves.

819,DD," \#1. Search bar top of page.  Type there, see how many posts with the stock ticker you want to learn about.  If its a good one, there will be quite a few posts about it.

\#2. There are sometimes subreddits of the stock too r/INND for example.

I like to take a look at the charts and see what the chart says.  There are some configurations that you can change to get a much better view of just how good it may be, or if it just hopeless rockets and emojis waiting with their shares for some suckers who saw a tic tok video and bought in so they can get the heck out with their money.

Charts.  Company website.  Google it, find any recent news, etc.

That's basic stuff that can get you a pretty good idea i in a short amount of time.   

 Yahoo Finance has a decent chart but be careful with OTC they don't update quick so you are pretty much looking back in time a bit.

That's the quick method.  Increased risk, because it takes DD, which takes time.

Good luck to you.  Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance and click view all. Check 50/200 MA + Float that the smaller the better and prefer under 100M. Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign. Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

928,TYME," With TYME the first red flags that popped out are:

1. The dilution. They issued 40m shares just after the patent news/when the price got up a little bit. That is more than 25% of the outstanding shares and almost as much as the float... Also, the timing of the offering is suspicious and means we could see this another time when the stock moves up...
2. The price target estimates (6/8/9) were pre-dilution. When they are updated it is possible to see another dip out of fear from downgrades.
3. Insider activity in the last 12 months is big. They sold a lot. Insiders own 49% (according to yahoo)  - more than the float. If they continue to sell...

Green flag: the 40m shares were at least a direct offering. The current price could be an entry point but idk.

938,HAS," Sure. And some of us don’t treat the stock market like a casino and try to understand corporate finance 101 before we throw money away. Reverse splits (and regular splits) are part of basic corporate finance that they teach in freshman year college courses... or anyone can learn in an hour by a simple “corporate finance 101” google search.

I totally understand the sink or swim approach of just jumping right in and learning on the fly, at least when there isn’t something substantial at risk. But, day trading is something even people that are knowledgeable about investing don’t do because of the swings (especially in inherently bankruptcy-risk instruments like penny stocks). People that don’t understand something as simple as a company decreasing its share count and the share price rising commensurately really shouldn’t be putting money into those instruments. Might as well play roulette.

This isn’t supposed to be an insult. It’s just that people really need to take the stock market seriously, and try to learn a little bit before they risk any real money. You wouldn’t drive a car without learning the basic operations first. If it’s just play money, specifically being used to learn (like testing a car in a parking lot for the first time), that’s one thing. If it’s anything substantial, people really need to do at least a bare minimum of study before they throw their money away.

I mean, last year you had tons of retail investors buying up Hertz stock after it filed chapter 11 because they didn’t understand the single most important  aspect of equity investing (equity risk — bankruptcy = equity gets $0 in 99.99% of cases). This is similar.

954,DD," $SENS seems to be the best choice at lowest cost  between 10 different competitors.  Good for a run, especially due to the recent news that Ascensia has committed to sales and marketing in the European market.

$AITX is starting to make some money and entered the market in Romania.
There may be some locsl positive partnership news coming out in the near future here too.

$SIRC I hope takes off like a rocket.  Solar energy should be utilized more. The Enerev acquisition was a good move and will do well for them.

$SSFT has a solid business, but some competition with other players, but the price is right to get on board.

959,DD," I'm not sure if you mean when an executive sells themselves stock in their own company, or if you mean to simply copy the portfolio of a wealthy person...

If insider buying is what you mean:

In OTC land, insider buys can indicate in opposite directions. It could be a pump and dump, ie the company has no future and is an atm. It can also indicate that the company genuinely has a future, and the executive in question is funding his/her own company in good faith. How can you know the difference? Deeper DD and chart indications of P&D. A YouTube search will show you how to read P&D in a chart, and what a P&D company profile looks like in terms of debt, transparency, history etc. 

Whalewisdom.com has the droids you are looking for. They are called 13f filings. Free version is updated quarterly, paid version gives you updates every 2 weeks. Quarterly is usually good enough. Insider buys in good faith usually don't happen immediately before a run, unless the volume spurrs it. If a fat 13f is filed by an insider a week before PR, be very very careful of P&D and be ready to drop it like a hot potato. 

If a stock has been deadpan, just flitting back and forth from 0001-0002 with low average volume, and three funds throw 5+ million at it, you can bet its for a reason. You just have to be careful because, the reason is always that they will make money. Will they make money if the company is legit and has legs? Yes. Will they make money if it's going to moon over the course of three days, then slowly peter out while the funds try to get off their shares at a pace to avoid producing chart-readable P&D characteristics? Yup. 

If you mean to simply look for a wealthy/successful persons portfolio to copy...

This isn't such an attractive concept unless you are loaded. Down here in OTC land, we are focused on leveraging risk in order to move up quickly. If you're someone managing a 50 mil portfolio, you're going to want to do things differently than someone trying to turn 5k into 500k. You're going to protect a significant portion, probably almost all of it. If that's what you want to do, I would go take a look at Ark Investment ETF contents. They're getting so much good press for these modest gains lol! This is what a wealthy person considers an ""aggressive"" portfolio.

YOU, being in this business for a while know that ABC product is currently the mkt leader, so you start to investigate and find out they are a small public company that you believe hasn't been given a fair mkt value based on what you're seeing in your own industry. A mkt disrupter is that such a company. A company that is finding new and better ways to serve the industry, disrupting the status quo - sort of taking on and possibly even taking out the big guy!!😁 Hope this helps",Maleficent_Club_2029,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/leyy5x/how_relevant_is_fundamental_financial_analysis/gmkiim3/,0.011,0.893,0.096,0.9328

975,AGTC," AGTC is another R&D type company recently issuing stock for cash.

What's the probability of success and what would that success pay back?

With these sorts of shares I'd take a portfolio approach. If you had investments in 10 of these companies then hopefully 1 would 20x your money and another couple return or double your investment. The rest wither on the vine.",Actualise101,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/leyy5x/how_relevant_is_fundamental_financial_analysis/gmj74my/,0.02,0.803,0.176,0.8979
976,IMO," lmao I've had positions in literally all of these except for ERPNF. 

IMO MLFB is gonna be hold until they get any sort of PR about the season they are planning

AITX is a long term hold for me. They seem to be ramping up sales and I believe in what the company is building towards

PVDG also is probably a hold until PR for me. IDK much about what they are about long term but I hear they will be announcing a lot soon

SNPW is a long term hold. I think they will run up pretty quick this year, then be stagnant for a while until they expand operations and people can see more revenue coming in. Also excited to see if they do anything with their solartech

RSSV I am planning on holding until at least .5 if not $1. I think their value hasn't been fully recognized yet.

HITIF I will hold as long as they have good revenues. 

Those are just my plans. Just make sure you do your own research and make your own exit strategies. You should always have your own opinions and targets otherwise the moment a stock goes down a bit you will be doubting and freaking out. I always rank them by risk and what I think their upside is. Out of all of these I think SNPW and AITX have most long term potential so I'll probably be holding them for years. The rest of them are more short term plays to me.",yarnafnaf,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/lfk71l/mlfb_aitx_pvdg_snpw_rssv_erpnfhitif/gmmamnf/,0.042,0.861,0.097,0.939

Some believe this will be happening within a week or two. Funding for the season is said to have been secured with TV deals already in place. We are waiting into the SEC filings to make it official.
