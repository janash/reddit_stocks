90,FAF," Does anybody more sleuthy than me want to look into Couchetard-> FAF -> American Acres Managers -> WeedMD (WMD/WDDMF)

There are some odd coincidences happening. Couchetard invests in Fire and Flower. Fire and Flower raises 15m. WeedMD raises 15m (that one went sideways with a refiled Q3 write down, but hey nobody’s perfect... ((edit: also might not be unrelated, something forced that accounting housecleaning right?)

Couchetard has agreements to buy more of FAF, who have agreements in place to buy this new ghost company American Acres Managers that is beginning to set up a chain of stores in the US; Couchetard wants to sell weed internationally, including across the US, and is getting going ahead of legalization.

The most interesting part to me was that the President and CEO of American Acres Managers is George Scorsis— who is also the interim CEO of WeedMD; Trevor Fencott, CEO of FAF, hired George to work at Mettrum years ago so they go back.

Would Couchetard ever be setting up to buy a few of the better smaller LPs in order to have more fingers in more pies? Sell some of your own products in your global pot shop chain, might not be the worst move.

I wrote to WeedMD to ask about the coincidences, of course they didn’t write back— but unless I’m blind, the highly redacted document that FAF put out on SEDAR filed Feb 21 or 22 that included George’s name has been pulled and replaced with a much shorter document (Feb 22 date) with no names at all... and the American Acres Managers website has been put on time out.

Color Cannabis seems like a good global brand to me, and their website sure uses the word ‘world’ a fair bit for a Canadian pot company.

I invested in WMD right after legalization because they had the best bang for bucks weed of all; I’m a poor picky addict, it’s my thing. Bad investment obviously, been holding red for years... but it’s been the least stressful bag ever, because I love their weed.

Anyway I’m all in on this stock now as of recently and somehow already dark red again because I’ve got as much financial savvy as Peter Pan... but in addition to a whole lot of good stuff i believe they’ve got going on, I’m rather interested in this curious strangeness that’s itching my brain.

Sure, it has halved, which means something, but it is not negative ([example](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CTXR/balance-sheet?p=CTXR)). If the company declares bankruptcy at that point, each shareholder will still receive $500 - though it will be unlikely that they file for bankruptcy, obviously.


Negative stock equity basically means that the company is insolvent. If they had to repay all their debts today, they'd be bankrupt. This is fundamentally different from the situation above.

That doesn't mean that the company is bound to go bankrupt. If the product is almost in production, they can sell themselves to solvency. If the product is promising they can gather either more debt, or issue more shares. But it does mean that there is a greater risk of bankruptcy (e.g. in the case of a setback), and a greater chance at dillution.",DutchPhenom,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/m7secw/asln_aslan_pharmaceuticals_receives_30_price/grepqbt/,0.137,0.744,0.119,-0.7776

111,RSI," That sucks about last week, that's a big loss to me.  I do the same thing; I fixate on ""well, let's see if it goes up to xxx and then I'll sell.""  

I've stopped doing that lately, though, as I've realized that maximizing the sell price means a minor difference in the bottom line, so just make the transaction and go.  I've actually started using market orders more often, too -- when I am buying/selling due to a trigger or timing (peak on RSI, hitting a resistance line, etc.) instead of a price target, I've stopped messing with limit orders.  Less time typing in the order, guaranteed it will be processed, it has made things easier.

Part of my concern with selling to lock in gains for AABB is that my original cost basis is so low, I feel comfortable letting it go up and down with the whims of the market.  I am worried that if I sell and lock in those profits, then I'll want to be strict about stop limits and things and may sell my shares before it takes off.  For example, there is a chance that AABB dips on open tomorrow, but then rallies and goes back up to $0.45+ -- if I am worried about the dip, I may miss out on the rally.  I think I'm just going to accept that risk, however, and focus on ""not losing money"" instead of just blindly trusting that AABB will go up to $0.6 eventually.",PsycheRevived,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/m7rgyt/aabb_asia_broadband/grepjgj/,0.071,0.837,0.092,0.7459

181,ONE," I did that with $SANP.. finding myself in 2017 holding a bag of 4 mil at $0.0009, I spent 3 years buying a mil here, a mil there at $0.0001, until I ended up with 14mil at $0.00027. I sold those last December at 0003 for 10% gain (3%apy), then watched the price hit $0.0348 in February... 

I literally sold half a million bucks, for $4,200.

Thing is, I had my 3 years of bagholding and zero communication from CEO on one hand... and ONE order someone placed in December for 2 billion shares at $0.0001 (a $200k commitment) on the other. I chose to sell based on what I knew, over what I speculated about the meaning of that one order for $200k.

* Same concept as Noveau Monde except their current market cap is $312M (vs $405M for NMGRF)

* The NPV of just the Vittangi resource is $1B (they also have rights to Niska - NPV ~$3B - and two other huge deposits that haven't been scoped yet).  

* Talga is further along the anode development phase - their standard graphite anode and silicon/graphene composite are both in testing around Europe.

Flurotech

TSX: $TEST | OTCQB: $FLURF

They're developing a revolutionary Pandemic Defense and Economic Recovery System. Their tech can rapidly test for COVID19 using saliva at entry ways of stadiums, airports, offices, etc. It is the first testing system that will be Antigen-based with a throughput capacity of 2,500+ tests per hour. They've got a great board with connections to the FDA, which will help with fast tracking authorization. This will be huge in the long run!
