Maxim Group‚Äôs Jason McCarthy Upgrades Titan Pharmaceuticals to Buy, Announces $11 Price Target 

Given the changes at the company and a cash runway into 2022, there is ‚Äúvalue to be unlocked,‚Äù McCarthy said.

‚ÄúEfforts around commercialization of Probuphine (buprenorphine ProNeura implant) are being 'smartly', in our view, wound down. The technology in ProNeura delivery is now shifting toward its next indications, most notably targeting pruritus with a peptide-based therapeutic, JT-09 (acquired from JT Pharma [private] in 4Q20),‚Äù the analyst wrote in a note.

‚ÄúManagement also plans to develop ProNeura-based nalmefene for prevention/treatment of opioid overdose,‚Äù he added.

‚ÄúOur view is that Titan has essentially hit the 'reset' button and taken what we view as an attractive and de-risked drug delivery technology, and steered it toward potential high-value therapeutic areas,‚Äù McCarthy noted.",unimpressed_observer,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/mafb5d/ttnp_2021_high_prediction/gru47k8/,0.0,0.959,0.041,0.6739
