359,GME," I‚Äôm using it in the context of there being only so much funds the ape army has to pump into something for its price to go up without having to write a dissertation on price action that will go unread. Ape money finite and currently largely tied between amc and gme. 

All the meme money can be pulled from amc and gme right now and thrown into Nokia and it‚Äôll hit what? A whopping 10-12$ a share. Nokia has been a money trap for the truly retarded of the meme army since this nonsense started. These people think they‚Äôre making a smart play ‚Äúgetting in early‚Äù. When in fact the only moon it‚Äôs going to is a moon bounce.

Tldr: most of this sub think every share of every company is basically identical and think Nokia can hit the price of gme which just as much ape money thrown into it. Gme at 5$ a share not the same at Nokia at 5$ a share. And market cap comparisons are a pretty brainless way of expressing that for anyone that‚Äôs not actually autistic. If GME has a market cap of 30 billion at 250 a share and Nokia has the same cap at 5$ a share anyone but the truly retarded can realize why Nokia ain‚Äôt going anywhere.",Sguru1,-6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nujffg/not_every_stock_is_a_short_squeeze/h0y0hdv/,0.05,0.856,0.094,0.6043

900,GME," Hi folks, if you check my post history you can see I know a thing or two about GME. 

GME itself moving from R2K to R1K is bearish. 

1) There are more assets under management indexed to the R2K vs R1K. For large caps (R1K) most index money is tied to the S&P 500, not the R1K. For an example of this, see the assets under management of IWB (R1K fund, ~30B aum) vs IWM (R2K fund, $70B aum). 
2) The total market cap of R1K is greater than R2K. Combine this with item 1) and that means that LESS money is spread across MORE market cap, i.e. less $ per equity of index buying. 
3) it's likely that the rank and relative weighting of gme will be much lower in the R1K compared to where it just was in the R2K. 

So I anticipate net selling on the 25th. Collars make sense if you're holding. 

On the flipside, if enough people think GME moving to R1K is bullish, then it might ramp in the meantime from people buying, but I'm not even sure this recent rally is retail driven at all.",FatAspirations,35,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntvua1/gme_and_amc_to_be_added_to_russell_1000_if_market/h0vo4jb/,0.021,0.954,0.025,-0.0772

People have been saying for months already that there was going to be a squeeze soon. People keep setting dates and it keeps not happening.

You won‚Äôt find any veteran traders who have actually made a lot of money trading and who have a deep understanding of the market setting those ridiculous price targets for GME.

I disagree with you though that for most of those people gamestop is ‚Äúmore than a store‚Äù. If it went out of business tomorrow and was replaced by a different company that served the same purpose, I doubt that many of the big gamers I know would care much, as long as they could still get their games and new systems.

1341,BB," The fact that you think Blackberry outperforms crowdstrike is hilarious.

BB purchased Cylance; which was eventually completely anihilated by crowdstrike and proven to be hot garbage.  Cylance was so shit, enterprises only purchased it because it was CHEAP and they had zero budget.  That's why ""BB"" is in any enterprises currently.  They just haven't purchased the actually good solutions yet (CrowdStrike, S1, Carbon Black, etc.)

Why is crowdstrike the best?

They collect meta data from every single computer installed on in an organization, send that data to the cloud, analyze it with the FIRST/most advanced Ai/ML algo for unusual pattern activity (ie. a user logging in on a sat. and deleting backups and encrypting stuff which is what ransomeware looks like)..AND then they have services (profesional cyber security gods) that investigate that data.

They have the second largest data imprint on Amazon Web Services...behind only Netflix.

This is with just storing meta-data....ie. logs of a person opening microsoft word, etc.

So tell me how BB/Cylance is better than CrowdStrike again?  Rofl.

BB is a nich product for security of iot type devices like cars, which is still important but what you said above is straight up lies.

People investing in BB deserve the truth and you gave them straight marketing garbage, with regards to enterpise security software. Banks will NOT go to BB if they have the money.  They will go to crowdstrike.  If they dont have the money, they will likely use other better solutions like SentinelOne, carbonblack, etc. that are leaps ahead of BB.

FInally if they are super broke they will use windows defender, which actually has decent efficacy despite being last-gen technology and has no threatgraph.",WeReallyOutHere420,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntvrr6/bb_consolidated_dd_why_last_week_was_just_a/h0x82y7/,0.042,0.803,0.156,0.9791

1346,BB," the comparison to top tier products like crowdstrike is completely deceptive in this writeup.  I detailed more in another comment in here.

BB is great for IOT type security, like for cars.

For enterprise security, it is garbage rebranded cylance.  It will never catch up to cs, s1, cb, etc.  The ""awards"" and accolades are well know pay to play non-awards to anyone knowledgable about cyber security, and their accounts are due to being a cheap product for organizations that have zero budget.",WeReallyOutHere420,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntvrr6/bb_consolidated_dd_why_last_week_was_just_a/h0x8nbb/,0.015,0.747,0.238,0.9595

1349,BB," I would never lie to you baby.

**TL;DR: No, it's not too late. When this is a $100 stock the difference between $10 and $14 will seem negligible.**

I want to put a lot more into BB - as in I sold off a quarter of my portfolio on Friday in preparation for Monday. My play is as follows:

* \~12.50 - \~14.50 is no man's land. I'm good with just holding in that range.
* If it opens high (above 14.50), I'll wait for the inevitable post-open drop. If it's still at 14.50 by 10:30 or if it climbs back, I'll be looking at buying a massive amount of $40 2023 LEAPS. The $40 strike is the best value here. People are rushing to the highest strike available - $42. So much so that the premium on $40 is actually *lower than the premium on $42 right now.*
* If it opens under $12.50 or falls there, I'll likely be buying a combination of shares and $40 LEAPS.
* If it opens high and stays high, I'll play $30 weeklies. Just a word of advice though, you'd have to be absolutely crazy to hold these to expiration unless a short squeeze or some massive turnaround actually happens. If you can buy on Monday and sell for a big profit before Wednesday, that's preferable here.

If there's a big drop down to $10 or so, don't despair and assume the run up isn't happening. It'll mean it's just been postponed and you can get in *even cheaper*. I originally got in at $18 in January. Watched it run up to the high 20s, and drop back to $8. I didn't reee and paper hand - I very happily averaged down. The 10x run up is inevitable, you just may have to wait a couple years.",TheCarlos,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntvrr6/bb_consolidated_dd_why_last_week_was_just_a/h0vcjir/,0.059,0.844,0.097,0.9305

1356,BB," no prob.  i like BB by the way.  i'd buy it.  But not for the enterprise security play.  

when a system has one specific purpose, like a car, to drive, it doesn't have tons of software the security solution has to ""play nice"" with.  You know what software the car will have, it wont be installing new random apps etc.  

Given we know that, a security solution is much easier as it doesnt have to whitelist/blacklist a ton of apps etc.  It can determine: only these apps are allowed to run, in this order, etc. and it's much easier to lock down.  SOemthing like cylance/BB works perfectly fine for that, and it's something that if you get it tuned and pre-installed it's a great value add.  

at enterprises, something like cylance can and has interrupted people trying to use microsoft excel, or word, or other random programs, interferred with databases, etc.

shit, i even had cylance installed on my personal computer in the past, and in the middle of a game of league of legends it randomly decided league was a ""malicious program"" and it deleted my game files WHILE I WAS PLAYING lol.",WeReallyOutHere420,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntvrr6/bb_consolidated_dd_why_last_week_was_just_a/h0xgnu7/,0.039,0.664,0.298,0.9962

1981,RC," The fact that the pandemic didn't cause massive, sweeping reforms to our healthcare system makes me worry it'll probably never happen. I can't think of a bigger indictment on our ass-backwards system than what he just all beared witness to. 

Tying healthcare to employment has never made any fucking sense, but we got to see first hand why. The pandemic causes shutdowns, shutdowns cause layoffs and now we have all these uninsured people during a pandemic. 

My state actually did a decent job of getting everyone on Medicare last year, proving that it's affordable and a viable option. However, most, including myself, got kicked off and had to go back to the private insurance racket. 

[This](https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/industries) is a list of the biggest lobbying industries in the US. Pharma is far and away the biggest spender. Insurance, hospitals, and hospital administrations are in the top 10. There's a fuckton of money being spent because the healthcare racket does not want to lose its golden goose. Once people realize that M4A is a cheaper and simpler solution, it'll be difficult to ever convince anyone we should go back to our old system. 

Those industries always push these narratives that people suffering under socialized medicine in Canada or Europe have to deal with an imperfect system. Yet, I've never once met anyone from a country with universal healthcare saying ""hey we should scrap this and do our healthcare like the Americans!"" Like you'd get laughed out of the room for suggesting it. 

Americans are conditioned to just not seek out treatment unless they're literally dying because of the costs and bills. Moreover, it's funny watching all these people push for ""mental health awareness,"" while completely missing the forest for the trees. Like certain NFL players or other celebrities like to virtue signal about mental health awareness, but totally seem to miss that most Americans are already hyper-aware of their mental health, but they can't afford treatment. Who gives a shit if you're aware of mental health issues if you have no access to affordable treatment? When I was younger, I was diagnosed with a pretty severe mental condition: the pediatrician told my parents that, ""best case scenario I would be retarded."" Have I been able to live a happy and fulfilling life, despite being fucking retarded? Sure. Have I had affordable access to treatment and counseling to mitigate my retardation? Fuck no I haven't. 

It doesn't matter if you watch Fox News or MSNBC, you're going to be hit with countless fucking advertisements from pharma or insurance companies. Those networks obviously will never bite the hand that feeds them and promote universal healthcare because those private industries pay all their bills. 

It was not shocking for anyone that we heard about Covid patients ending up with a bill for thousands of dollars. That's just what we've come to expect. Healthcare is one of those things that doesn't really follow other trends in economics. For instance, if I want to buy a Pepsi and they tell me it is $5,000, I'll tell them to get fucked and go buy an RC Cola instead. With healthcare, lots of people are put into a situation where it's either ""pay a ridiculously high price or literally die or fall ill."" They can gouge the ever-living fuck out of prices and people don't really have the means or the option to tell them to get fucked. 

A big point of single payer is that the US would negotiate drug prices and they won't be getting bent over and gouged like the rest of us. The US isn't going to spend $1000 of your tax dollars to buy a single EpiPen or they're not going to spend $700 a month to treat one junkie with Suboxone. 

That's why they lobby way more than any other industry. That's why they spend so much time influencing leaders and advertising on television. Our system is so ridiculously ass-backwards and it makes zero sense, and they know this. They spend a metric fuckton just pushing narratives and leaders to pretend like our system makes a lick of sense, but it doesn't.",Claudius_Gothicus,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nuhgua/clov_bet_torwards_a_better_america_and_a_better/h0y1yt5/,0.096,0.79,0.115,0.9492

Not missing out on this!

Other CRAZY CATALYSTS for CLOV!!

1. Extremely high SI (40%+)
2. CEO and owners can‚Äôt sell until stock hits 30$ for 90 days. Stock is currently at 9$.
3. Recently joined MCSI index and had a nice run up from 7.7 to 9
4. ZERO DEBT, 700 million cash, unlike AMC, no risk of dilution!
5. Will be added to Russel 3000 soon, should be another nice reason to begin lift-off. ** MVIS was added last Friday and we saw what happened there!
6. Available shares to short almost done and BORROWING rate going up, doubled last week.
7. They beat earnings two weeks ago!

2212,GME," Well there are two ways to do this.  First watch the SP all day, when you see 5 to 20 dollar drops get in and hold.  Take profits when you are up.  The second way is to wait when both retail and hedge funds are reloading and the SP drifts down.  So say its like 222 and falls to 120.  Yeah that would be a time to hop in for GME.  You know they want GME down into teens, you know they want to profit all the way down.  You have an opponent willing to sustain repetitive injuries to achieve a goal using a very specific method.

Look at any zero sum game where an instant win can be achieved.  Throwing hay makers in boxing, going all in on a poker hand and so on.  It requires a great deal of energy and effort.  If you get countered the effects can be devastating.  If you don't lose because of being countered  you are in a desperate situation.  So the instant win strategy becomes your only way out, but now it requires more effort and energy.  Again getting devastated if it doesn't work.

So we have these stupid fucking hedge funds that are throwing hay maker after hay maker.  Just dying to give away free money because they really need to win this.  They also don't want these losses to be on their yearly statement.  It's one thing to get hit in one or two quarters but make your money back in the last two.  It becomes a funny story at the Holiday Party.  But get beaten in all 4 quarters?  People lose jobs, and the ""Smart Money"" no longer looks so smart.

**There is a huge industry behind managed money.  So to get beaten by WSB is a huge blow to that as well.**  

The best part about that is they can't just turn around and join in, because that is a loss for them.  Having to bow to WSB and make money by backing the investments we like.  Retail dictating what Hedge Funds buy is a nightmare scenario for them.  Because if we can do it, it suddenly becomes repeatable.

2217,DD," Who cares. Everybody should do their own DD and come to their own conclusions. Don‚Äôt just base it on what DFV did and does. 

Figure out which one has the higher chance of a turnaround. Are they in a growing market or a shrinking market? Are they in debt? How diluted are the shares of the company. What does the team look like. Is this a good long term play if a squeeze never happens? 

And if you‚Äôre just buying on the squeeze, then figure out which is carrying the higher short interest through what‚Äôs listed, ftds, married calls/puts, deep OTM puts, etc, and compare that to the number of shares outstanding. Whichever has the higher ratio has the bigger squeeze potential. 

Finally, compare the number of shares available in the float to the amount that retail owns to make sure that your stock of choice has an actual likelihood of being squeezed. 

If one of those stocks is better on every front, that‚Äôs probably the one you want. 

Should you diversify? Not if you actually believe in what you‚Äôre doing. It merely reduces pressure on the short position and makes a squeeze less likely.

2226,GME," Short selling got an undeservingly bad reputation over the past decade or so. When they pulled the Uptick Rule, they've blamed the 2008 crash on a bear raid in Q4 2007. 

Short selling has a good purpose, but it's been abused in the past to manipulate share prices in the market. The SEC put in a modified Uptick Rule sometime in 2009 or 2010 I think, so it *shouldn't* happen, but then you have all of these naked (illegal) shorts using shares borrowed from borrowed shares that were lent and borrowed and borrowed and lent. There's a huge difference. 

So yeah, I agree. It has a place, and it's a valuable tool even for retail investors. The trouble is when people f\*&k with the rules and change the game for everyone else.

*Also this sub seems way too focused on short interest and seem to think every stock is about to squeeze due to GME hype and it's really, really bad to use that as the rationale behind buying a stock.

2230,DD," The problem I see, is shorting is hugely abused. Not just naked shorting. I agree, naked shorting is evil for all Intents and purposes and should be put down. Now, there has been considerable DD done on sec ‚Äúfines‚Äù for misclassifying shorts as longs to cover margins. That is like the number one fine, they don‚Äôt mark a sale as short and creates false liquidity. Shorting in itself literally drives price down artificially, since you never paid into the stock. In essence it‚Äôs the casino effect of stacking odds in your favor. The more you short, the more drastic prices change, causing potentially good companies to come crumbling down. This process has set back our medical research by decades. It shouldn‚Äôt exist in a fair market, it is literally a tool of the wealthy to keep people down. You dont like the stock? Buy a put. That‚Äôs fair and equal.

Edit: to clarify sec fines are like 150k 3-5 years down the road, when misclassifying is making/saving funds millions. Is just the cost of doing business, or a bribe.

2231,GME," There was a time when I was completely ignorant and thought shorting might be a niche tool for the market.  But then I started asking myself some serious questions.  

One of the questions I asked was, ""If you agreed to let someone borrow something and found out later they sold it in some crazy effort to buy it back at a lower price, how would you react?""  My answer was, ""I would be PISSED OFF!""  Firstly, I would never agree to have any borrowed objects sold for any reason.  Second, the object I borrow in question will more often than not have more value than the value its sold for, which often means that this idea burns the borrower when they pay more than they sold it for.  

Finally, there's this idea going around that doing this kind of trading stabilizes the market and helps prevent crazy spikes in demand, and I find that to be definitively false on the securities side.  If you friend agreed to let you borrow his PS5 so you could sell it then buy it back for a profit, 99 times out of 100 you'll be the one who gets burned because you sold it at the wrong price, the fees kill your profit or your friend forces you to buy it back.  As for securities, the ongoing instability with GME and other highly praised stocks proves shorting doesn't help stabilize crap, and that 99 shorts out of 100 got burned because they shorted at the wrong price, the borrowing fees kill their profits or the margin calls forced them to buy it back.

If a given stock was at the maximum possible price it could sell for on the market, then theoretically, I might be open to the idea of shorting if the stock was within 90% or so of the maximum price allowable, the stock could not be split to lower the price, and the margin risk of reaching the maximum price was acceptable to the broker.  But that's all nonsense, the truth is if I had power over the laws in the market, I would make shorting illegal because it does more harm than good.",Raiqchan,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nu47k3/shorting_is_not_bad_not_going_away/h0xxx7u/,0.177,0.698,0.125,-0.9777

2242,INO," Have you seen this stock market...?  This is one of the most untrustworthy markets that exists at this point.  And why is that?  *Shorting*.

Practically every stock is being shorted.  INO as an example, has never once released a product and has never once finished a vaccine despite always being in the race every time a pandemic hits.  It was a huge BUY here on this sub a while back despite their borderline fraudulent behavior simply because ""STONK IS BIG SHARTED, BUY BUY BUY"".

What about this is healthy?  If the company is fraudulent, just don't buy shares.  If the company is failing, just don't buy shares.  If you already have shares and you see that the company is a fraud, sell your shares.  If shareholders sell and buyers aren't willing to buy at higher prices, the value goes down.  Simple as that.  Fraudulent companies don't need shares sold short to be exposed.

And it's still worth it to expose fraudulent companies because puts exist.  Exposing the fraud from INO?  Get puts.  Is the IV too high?  Then wait a bit for it to drop before releasing the report.  If people keep buying it, driving up the price, that's their own problem, they should have done their research before putting money into a company they barely know anything about.

Everybody fucking loves this stock. If you think I cherrypicked threads, google ‚ÄúUWMC stock reddit‚Äù and open up the first 50 reddit threads. Read every comment on every one. Everybody. fucking. loves. this. stock. apes.. boomers.. value investors.. whatever the fuck the r/stockmarket people are called, they all like it. Plus a lot of these threads calling this a steal are from when this was at $11+/ share. currently at $9. This thing could go up 20% tomorrow and it would still be a steal.  
**Price target**  
This is a $15-18 stock trading at $9. My bull case: current fair value of $20. Easily $40 by 2023, wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see $60+. If this squeezes, we could see that in the next few months.  
**Bear case**  
The main one I see is the debt, but even that is not so bad. They do have a sizeable amount of debt, see chart above. But the Fed will do anything and everything to preserve rates. This precious stock market will be caudled all the way to UWMC $60. So the debt is not such a bad thing. They‚Äôre betting on themselves and the Fed isn't stepping in. They‚Äôre invested in the future of this company, and the revenue growth makes me less worried about this.  
**Catalyst**  
Ok so what‚Äôs the catalyst for the pop?  
1. What was the catalyst in BB/AMC/SENS/WKHS popping? People saw the short interest? Probably, but not sure. I think people just need to look at it and say would you look at this. I think shorters are now scared to get involved with reddit stocks, so WSB interest in this could scare them out. As we‚Äôve seen with all the other stonks, once the shorts are out, the sky is the limit  
2. Check out this DD by u/icedknee, on how Wall Street‚Äôs top brokers are quietly tightening their rules for who can bet against retail traders‚Äô most-popular stocks. ‚ÄúNow the hedge funds can‚Äôt keep adding to their position at higher prices to avoid getting margin called.‚Äù Once it starts to run, it‚Äôs gone. These upward movements are going to be a snowball effect.  
3. Dividend this week, people are going to want in before that. plus it‚Äôs on 6/9 lol  
4. UWMC had a mishap in getting their stock listen on the Russel index. There is a lot up in the air as to if/ when it might be listed, and question marks around this inclusion. Once the dust settles, a listing on the Russel could start the snowball in motion. From u/ swamipro, ‚Äú1. Institutions have been shying away from adding the stock because they view the inclusion as not guaranteed- Fintel is showing about a 30% institutional ownership-only 10% increase from May 15th- added stocks are at least at 60%. Folks don't fully grasp how much pressure this is...Excited about a $300 million buyback over 2 years? Institutions have to buy 25 million shares over 15 trading days!‚Äù  
5. Buyback. I don‚Äôt see it staying this low for that long. They've said they think the stock is a steal at current prices (which were $7) so I could see more of the aforementioned buyback happening sooner rather than later, as the run up appears to have started.  
6. Quad witching. Did you feel that? that‚Äôs 70% of WSB wincing. ‚ÄúThis time will be different‚Äù ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. For apes: quadruple witching refers to the third Friday of every March, June, September and December. On these days,¬†derivatives¬†(e.g. market index futures, options futures, stock options, stock futures) expire, usually resulting in increased volatility. With the current IV being so low (66%), even if nothing happens, calls going up. This is the IV play we talked about earlier. 6/18, mark your calendars. Or wait.. dates are already marked on your calendar.  
7. Earnings run up. Expected sometime in August/ September. Earnings expectations have already been raised once in the last 30 days, 2-3 months out. I could see this running up to earnings  
tl:dr UWMC has 20.5% short interest, insane growth compared to peers, static stock relative to peers (for now), 5% dividend, great financials, low IV (for now), plus half of WSB already fucking owns the stock. tons of bag holders waiting to be saved.

3068,AMC," It kind of follows it a bit cause of the association as others have mentioned. 

However, GME‚Äôs market cap is 2.5x as large as BB‚Äôs. AMC‚Äôs is 3.5x as large. These multiples need to be applied to BB appropriately with the buy and sell orders + options trading to reflect the same *magnitude* of movement. This means that 2/5ths of the volume vs GME and 2/7ths of the volume vs AMC. In other words, it takes way less to move the price of BB.

Now this is where I get a bit perplexed‚Ä¶ BB has been the lead ticker in this sub for the last week and is not moving at a larger magnitude relative to GME and AMC. In addition, this stock is not only a hidden gold mine but also has its dick beaten down for 5 months straight. Just my honest opinion, but I see WAY more promise in terms of future growth and value a few years down the line compared to most amped up stocks in this sub. BB is the play. Always has been. Many are realizing now that this company has a short term opportunity with very minimal downside in the long term. It‚Äôs the perfect place to park money for massive returns. HOWEVER, the *magnitude* of these movements in BB are not 2.5-3.5x larger than GME and AMC. That is very very weird. Perhaps buy and sell indicators for day traders are being primarily based off of AMC is my theory. 

This is all going to change though! I am sure most of you dumb asses know recently it has followed suit of AMC, but I don‚Äôt think it will anymore for long, but instead it will break free and find it‚Äôs own pattern. I actually think it will end up being the leading pattern pretty soon here. More and more people will realize that BB can make way more money from this point forward. It has only doubled from it‚Äôs low a few weeks back. AMC has grown substantially more than this. 

Would you rather FOMO into AMC that already exploded or get into BB before it has exploded? Why can‚Äôt we see this shift in sentiment reflected into the market cap of BB? If it were to catch up to AMC‚Äôs current market cap, that would make it priced in at $55+ per share. PLUS, this isn‚Äôt even a fair comparison because AMC as a company does not have the same promise in the future as BB. It could go way way higher than $55 per share. 

PS. I think AMC still has room to grow but I see better opportunity with new money in BB from what I discussed above.

These multiples need to be applied to BB appropriately with the buy and sell orders + options trading to reflect the same *magnitude* of movement. This means that 2/5ths of the volume vs GME and 2/7ths of the volume vs AMC. In other words, it takes way less to move the price of BB.

Now this is where I get a bit perplexed‚Ä¶ BB has been the lead ticker in this sub for the last week and is not moving at a larger magnitude relative to GME and AMC. In addition, this stock is not only a hidden gold mine but also has its dick beaten down for 5 months straight. Just my honest opinion, but I see WAY more promise in terms of future growth and value a few years down the line compared to most amped up stocks in this sub. BB is the play. Always has been. Many are realizing now that this company has a short term opportunity with very minimal downside in the long term. It‚Äôs the perfect place to park money for massive returns. HOWEVER, the *magnitude* of these movements in BB are not 2.5-3.5x larger than GME and AMC. That is very very weird. Perhaps buy and sell indicators for day traders are being primarily based off of AMC is my theory. 

This is all going to change though! I am sure most of you dumb asses know recently it has followed suit of AMC, but I don‚Äôt think it will anymore for long, but instead it will break free and find it‚Äôs own pattern. I actually think it will end up being the leading pattern pretty soon here. More and more people will realize that BB can make way more money from this point forward. It has only doubled from it‚Äôs low a few weeks back. AMC has grown substantially more than this. 

Would you rather FOMO into AMC that already exploded or get into BB before it has exploded? Why can‚Äôt we see this shift in sentiment reflected into the market cap of BB? If it were to catch up to AMC‚Äôs current market cap, that would make it priced in at $55+ per share. PLUS, this isn‚Äôt even a fair comparison because AMC as a company does not have the same promise in the future as BB. It could go way way higher than $55 per share. 

PS. I think AMC still has room to grow but I see better opportunity with new money in BB from what I discussed above.

3251,AMZN," On the topic of a possible acquisition of Rite Aid, while I'm not sure that Albertsons would be involved in a Rite Aid buyout scenario, I believe there are several companies for whom RAD would clearly be a strategic acquisition.

**Amazon**

CFRA Research group recently stated (Thursday, June 3, 2021) in its latest Rite Aid (RAD) analysis report:

""***It would make more sense for AMZN to acquire a regional drug retailer like RAD to quickly establish a physical presence***.""

Also, it should be noted that there is already a partnership existing between Amazon and Rite Aid since July of 2019. Rite Aid was the first partner that Amazon selected for its retail in-store pick-up program called Amazon Counter. Here is the link for the launch of the program:

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-rite-aid/amazon-launches-new-in-store-pickup-option-with-rite-aid-as-first-partner-idUSKCN1TS0RI](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-rite-aid/amazon-launches-new-in-store-pickup-option-with-rite-aid-as-first-partner-idUSKCN1TS0RI)

So the companies are already coordinating some business activities to a minor extent.

Finally, with the acquisition of Bartell Drugs, Rite Aid became the #1 retail pharmacy in Seattle, WA. Should Amazon buyout Rite Aid, AMZN itself would be able to cut out the middleman and provide cost effective prescription drug benefits to its 75,000 employees at the Seattle headquarters.

**Walmart**

Walmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company. However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens. In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale. If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over. WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.

A couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:

Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions thereby lowering its overall drug cost, improving profitability

All the goods sold in the front-end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products Walmart sells in its own department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.

Based on the above 2 points, Walmart would improve both its own existing margins and at the same time would improve those of the Rite Aid revenue through such an acquisition.

The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.

If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $4 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels. So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payback on the investment.

Whichever company, Walmart or Amazon, utlimately decides to buy Rite Aid, that corporation will instantly become the #3 retail pharmacy in the USA, and will be well-positioned to someday challenge CVS and Walgreens for the #1 or #2 spots.

**Walgreens**

Another darkhorse in this whole race is Walgreens. This week, Walgreens completed the sale of its Alliance Healthcare businesses to AmerisourceBergen for $6.5 billion (---see link below this paragraph). This windfall gives WBA the needed funds to finally finish the takeover of Rite Aid that it started back in 2015. While that deal was ultimately blocked by the courts, no judge could reasonably claim today that there is insufficent competition to support consumers if the balance of Rite Aid was taken over by Walgreens (NOTE: WBA bought 1,900+ RAD stores in 2018, and RAD currently has 2,500+ stores remaining). With CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Kroger, and numberous mail order prescription services (including Amazon), there is pleny of competition in the USA.

An acquisition of Rite Aid by Walgreens would be a highly strategic move accomplishing the following:

\- Gaining more size and scale, thereby putting WBA in a much more competitive position with CVS

\- Giving Walgreens a PBM in Rite Aid's Elixir group that would help WBA gain more prescription drug business share compete more successfully in that category

\- Blocking both Amazon ( $AMZN ) and Walmart ( $WMT ) from acquiring Rite Aid thereby removing the threat of a financially powerful competitor moving into the #3 retail pharmacy spot in the USA.

3252,CVS," On the topic of a possible acquisition of Rite Aid, while I'm not sure that Albertsons would be involved in a Rite Aid buyout scenario, I believe there are several companies for whom RAD would clearly be a strategic acquisition.

**Amazon**

CFRA Research group recently stated (Thursday, June 3, 2021) in its latest Rite Aid (RAD) analysis report:

""***It would make more sense for AMZN to acquire a regional drug retailer like RAD to quickly establish a physical presence***.""

Also, it should be noted that there is already a partnership existing between Amazon and Rite Aid since July of 2019. Rite Aid was the first partner that Amazon selected for its retail in-store pick-up program called Amazon Counter. Here is the link for the launch of the program:

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-rite-aid/amazon-launches-new-in-store-pickup-option-with-rite-aid-as-first-partner-idUSKCN1TS0RI](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-rite-aid/amazon-launches-new-in-store-pickup-option-with-rite-aid-as-first-partner-idUSKCN1TS0RI)

So the companies are already coordinating some business activities to a minor extent.

Finally, with the acquisition of Bartell Drugs, Rite Aid became the #1 retail pharmacy in Seattle, WA. Should Amazon buyout Rite Aid, AMZN itself would be able to cut out the middleman and provide cost effective prescription drug benefits to its 75,000 employees at the Seattle headquarters.

**Walmart**

Walmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company. However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens. In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale. If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over. WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.

A couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:

Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions thereby lowering its overall drug cost, improving profitability

All the goods sold in the front-end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products Walmart sells in its own department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.

Based on the above 2 points, Walmart would improve both its own existing margins and at the same time would improve those of the Rite Aid revenue through such an acquisition.

The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.

If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $4 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels. So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payback on the investment.

Whichever company, Walmart or Amazon, utlimately decides to buy Rite Aid, that corporation will instantly become the #3 retail pharmacy in the USA, and will be well-positioned to someday challenge CVS and Walgreens for the #1 or #2 spots.

**Walgreens**
