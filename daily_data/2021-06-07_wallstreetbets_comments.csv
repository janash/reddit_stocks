900,GME," Hi folks, if you check my post history you can see I know a thing or two about GME. 

GME itself moving from R2K to R1K is bearish. 

1) There are more assets under management indexed to the R2K vs R1K. For large caps (R1K) most index money is tied to the S&P 500, not the R1K. For an example of this, see the assets under management of IWB (R1K fund, ~30B aum) vs IWM (R2K fund, $70B aum). 
2) The total market cap of R1K is greater than R2K. Combine this with item 1) and that means that LESS money is spread across MORE market cap, i.e. less $ per equity of index buying. 
3) it's likely that the rank and relative weighting of gme will be much lower in the R1K compared to where it just was in the R2K. 

So I anticipate net selling on the 25th. Collars make sense if you're holding. 

On the flipside, if enough people think GME moving to R1K is bullish, then it might ramp in the meantime from people buying, but I'm not even sure this recent rally is retail driven at all.",FatAspirations,35,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntvua1/gme_and_amc_to_be_added_to_russell_1000_if_market/h0vo4jb/,0.021,0.954,0.025,-0.0772

916,GME," Ok let’s talk option GME plays going into earnings this week!

This is going to be a very interesting one and curious how others are going to play it.

I’ve only ever been IV crushed holding past earnings, even if my directional play is right it’s never been with it. I’m thinking about taking a call position and ride the IV up and sell before 6/9 then buying my leaps on right after when IV is crushed.

Any feedback? How are y’all playing it?",JackedToTheTits69,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntvua1/gme_and_amc_to_be_added_to_russell_1000_if_market/h0x0zwo/,0.059,0.766,0.176,0.846

going to love to see who is swimming naked when the tide goes out..

can't wait to see the price in GME rip maybe hold at 1,000 to try make people sell for far less then everyone knows fair well it should get to

watching Apes refuse to sell at 1k maybe for days.. until its let loose to find its true price discovery

would love to know how many shares are totally phantoms...

I want the float to get bought up ridiculously high prices just to see it hold there past the t+2 because there physically are not enough to cover...

Also kinda new is the gamma squeeze.  Mass retail purchase of options causing MM's to hedge is making things even more volatile.

1018,GME," I disagree heartily on the idea that it’s undervalued. I would argue quite the opposite. It’s a store that sells video games that has said they plan to transition to online sales. Maybe they were undervalued at $4, but right now they’re WILDLY overvalued if you ask me. 

People have been saying for months already that there was going to be a squeeze soon. People keep setting dates and it keeps not happening. And, no offense, but the people who write about how the shares are gonna be worth a million each and shit like that? Every one of those “DD” posts I’ve read is clearly written by someone who has no clue what they’re talking about. You won’t find any veteran traders who have actually made a lot of money trading and who have a deep understanding of the market setting those ridiculous price targets for GME. 

The reason I don’t buy a share “just in case” is because, like I said, I consider the company to be wildly overvalued.

I believe it to be overvalued, and I expect it will drop - that doesn’t mean I want to bet on it. Stock never does what you think it’s gonna. Doesn’t change my opinion on what I think it should do, though.

1341,BB," The fact that you think Blackberry outperforms crowdstrike is hilarious.

BB purchased Cylance; which was eventually completely anihilated by crowdstrike and proven to be hot garbage.  Cylance was so shit, enterprises only purchased it because it was CHEAP and they had zero budget.  That's why ""BB"" is in any enterprises currently.  They just haven't purchased the actually good solutions yet (CrowdStrike, S1, Carbon Black, etc.)

Why is crowdstrike the best?

They collect meta data from every single computer installed on in an organization, send that data to the cloud, analyze it with the FIRST/most advanced Ai/ML algo for unusual pattern activity (ie. a user logging in on a sat. and deleting backups and encrypting stuff which is what ransomeware looks like)..AND then they have services (profesional cyber security gods) that investigate that data.

They have the second largest data imprint on Amazon Web Services...behind only Netflix.

This is with just storing meta-data....ie. logs of a person opening microsoft word, etc.

So tell me how BB/Cylance is better than CrowdStrike again?  Rofl.

BB is a nich product for security of iot type devices like cars, which is still important but what you said above is straight up lies.

People investing in BB deserve the truth and you gave them straight marketing garbage, with regards to enterpise security software. Banks will NOT go to BB if they have the money.  They will go to crowdstrike.  If they dont have the money, they will likely use other better solutions like SentinelOne, carbonblack, etc. that are leaps ahead of BB.

1349,BB," I would never lie to you baby.

**TL;DR: No, it's not too late. When this is a $100 stock the difference between $10 and $14 will seem negligible.**

I want to put a lot more into BB - as in I sold off a quarter of my portfolio on Friday in preparation for Monday. My play is as follows:

* \~12.50 - \~14.50 is no man's land. I'm good with just holding in that range.
* If it opens high (above 14.50), I'll wait for the inevitable post-open drop. If it's still at 14.50 by 10:30 or if it climbs back, I'll be looking at buying a massive amount of $40 2023 LEAPS. The $40 strike is the best value here. People are rushing to the highest strike available - $42. So much so that the premium on $40 is actually *lower than the premium on $42 right now.*
* If it opens under $12.50 or falls there, I'll likely be buying a combination of shares and $40 LEAPS.
* If it opens high and stays high, I'll play $30 weeklies. Just a word of advice though, you'd have to be absolutely crazy to hold these to expiration unless a short squeeze or some massive turnaround actually happens. If you can buy on Monday and sell for a big profit before Wednesday, that's preferable here.

If there's a big drop down to $10 or so, don't despair and assume the run up isn't happening. It'll mean it's just been postponed and you can get in *even cheaper*. I originally got in at $18 in January. Watched it run up to the high 20s, and drop back to $8. I didn't reee and paper hand - I very happily averaged down.

1356,BB," no prob.  i like BB by the way.  i'd buy it.  But not for the enterprise security play.  

when a system has one specific purpose, like a car, to drive, it doesn't have tons of software the security solution has to ""play nice"" with.  You know what software the car will have, it wont be installing new random apps etc.  

Given we know that, a security solution is much easier as it doesnt have to whitelist/blacklist a ton of apps etc.  It can determine: only these apps are allowed to run, in this order, etc. and it's much easier to lock down.  SOemthing like cylance/BB works perfectly fine for that, and it's something that if you get it tuned and pre-installed it's a great value add.  

at enterprises, something like cylance can and has interrupted people trying to use microsoft excel, or word, or other random programs, interferred with databases, etc.

1981,RC," The fact that the pandemic didn't cause massive, sweeping reforms to our healthcare system makes me worry it'll probably never happen. I can't think of a bigger indictment on our ass-backwards system than what he just all beared witness to. 

Tying healthcare to employment has never made any fucking sense, but we got to see first hand why. The pandemic causes shutdowns, shutdowns cause layoffs and now we have all these uninsured people during a pandemic. 

My state actually did a decent job of getting everyone on Medicare last year, proving that it's affordable and a viable option. However, most, including myself, got kicked off and had to go back to the private insurance racket. 

[This](https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/industries) is a list of the biggest lobbying industries in the US. Pharma is far and away the biggest spender. Insurance, hospitals, and hospital administrations are in the top 10. There's a fuckton of money being spent because the healthcare racket does not want to lose its golden goose. Once people realize that M4A is a cheaper and simpler solution, it'll be difficult to ever convince anyone we should go back to our old system. 

Those industries always push these narratives that people suffering under socialized medicine in Canada or Europe have to deal with an imperfect system. Yet, I've never once met anyone from a country with universal healthcare saying ""hey we should scrap this and do our healthcare like the Americans!"" Like you'd get laughed out of the room for suggesting it. 

Americans are conditioned to just not seek out treatment unless they're literally dying because of the costs and bills. Moreover, it's funny watching all these people push for ""mental health awareness,"" while completely missing the forest for the trees. Like certain NFL players or other celebrities like to virtue signal about mental health awareness, but totally seem to miss that most Americans are already hyper-aware of their mental health, but they can't afford treatment. Who gives a shit if you're aware of mental health issues if you have no access to affordable treatment? When I was younger, I was diagnosed with a pretty severe mental condition: the pediatrician told my parents that, ""best case scenario I would be retarded."" Have I been able to live a happy and fulfilling life, despite being fucking retarded? Sure. Have I had affordable access to treatment and counseling to mitigate my retardation? Fuck no I haven't. 

It doesn't matter if you watch Fox News or MSNBC, you're going to be hit with countless fucking advertisements from pharma or insurance companies. Those networks obviously will never bite the hand that feeds them and promote universal healthcare because those private industries pay all their bills. 

It was not shocking for anyone that we heard about Covid patients ending up with a bill for thousands of dollars. That's just what we've come to expect. Healthcare is one of those things that doesn't really follow other trends in economics. For instance, if I want to buy a Pepsi and they tell me it is $5,000, I'll tell them to get fucked and go buy an RC Cola instead. With healthcare, lots of people are put into a situation where it's either ""pay a ridiculously high price or literally die or fall ill."" They can gouge the ever-living fuck out of prices and people don't really have the means or the option to tell them to get fucked. 

A big point of single payer is that the US would negotiate drug prices and they won't be getting bent over and gouged like the rest of us. The US isn't going to spend $1000 of your tax dollars to buy a single EpiPen or they're not going to spend $700 a month to treat one junkie with Suboxone. 

That's why they lobby way more than any other industry. That's why they spend so much time influencing leaders and advertising on television. Our system is so ridiculously ass-backwards and it makes zero sense, and they know this. They spend a metric fuckton just pushing narratives and leaders to pretend like our system makes a lick of sense, but it doesn't.",Claudius_Gothicus,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nuhgua/clov_bet_torwards_a_better_america_and_a_better/h0y1yt5/,0.096,0.79,0.115,0.9492

2212,GME," Well there are two ways to do this.  First watch the SP all day, when you see 5 to 20 dollar drops get in and hold.  Take profits when you are up.  The second way is to wait when both retail and hedge funds are reloading and the SP drifts down.  So say its like 222 and falls to 120.  Yeah that would be a time to hop in for GME.  You know they want GME down into teens, you know they want to profit all the way down.  You have an opponent willing to sustain repetitive injuries to achieve a goal using a very specific method.

Look at any zero sum game where an instant win can be achieved.  Throwing hay makers in boxing, going all in on a poker hand and so on.  It requires a great deal of energy and effort.  If you get countered the effects can be devastating.  If you don't lose because of being countered  you are in a desperate situation.  So the instant win strategy becomes your only way out, but now it requires more effort and energy.  Again getting devastated if it doesn't work.

So we have these stupid fucking hedge funds that are throwing hay maker after hay maker.  Just dying to give away free money because they really need to win this.  They also don't want these losses to be on their yearly statement.  It's one thing to get hit in one or two quarters but make your money back in the last two.

2213,SP," Well there are two ways to do this.  First watch the SP all day, when you see 5 to 20 dollar drops get in and hold.  Take profits when you are up.  The second way is to wait when both retail and hedge funds are reloading and the SP drifts down.  So say its like 222 and falls to 120.  Yeah that would be a time to hop in for GME.  You know they want GME down into teens, you know they want to profit all the way down.  You have an opponent willing to sustain repetitive injuries to achieve a goal using a very specific method.

Look at any zero sum game where an instant win can be achieved.  Throwing hay makers in boxing, going all in on a poker hand and so on.  It requires a great deal of energy and effort.  If you get countered the effects can be devastating.  If you don't lose because of being countered  you are in a desperate situation.  So the instant win strategy becomes your only way out, but now it requires more effort and energy.  Again getting devastated if it doesn't work.

2217,DD," Who cares. Everybody should do their own DD and come to their own conclusions. Don’t just base it on what DFV did and does. 

Figure out which one has the higher chance of a turnaround. Are they in a growing market or a shrinking market? Are they in debt? How diluted are the shares of the company. What does the team look like. Is this a good long term play if a squeeze never happens? 

And if you’re just buying on the squeeze, then figure out which is carrying the higher short interest through what’s listed, ftds, married calls/puts, deep OTM puts, etc, and compare that to the number of shares outstanding. Whichever has the higher ratio has the bigger squeeze potential. 

Finally, compare the number of shares available in the float to the amount that retail owns to make sure that your stock of choice has an actual likelihood of being squeezed. 

If one of those stocks is better on every front, that’s probably the one you want. 

Should you diversify? Not if you actually believe in what you’re doing. It merely reduces pressure on the short position and makes a squeeze less likely.

2226,GME," Short selling got an undeservingly bad reputation over the past decade or so. When they pulled the Uptick Rule, they've blamed the 2008 crash on a bear raid in Q4 2007. 

Short selling has a good purpose, but it's been abused in the past to manipulate share prices in the market. The SEC put in a modified Uptick Rule sometime in 2009 or 2010 I think, so it *shouldn't* happen, but then you have all of these naked (illegal) shorts using shares borrowed from borrowed shares that were lent and borrowed and borrowed and lent. There's a huge difference. 

So yeah, I agree. It has a place, and it's a valuable tool even for retail investors. The trouble is when people f\*&k with the rules and change the game for everyone else.

Now, there has been considerable DD done on sec “fines” for misclassifying shorts as longs to cover margins. That is like the number one fine, they don’t mark a sale as short and creates false liquidity. Shorting in itself literally drives price down artificially, since you never paid into the stock. In essence it’s the casino effect of stacking odds in your favor. The more you short, the more drastic prices change, causing potentially good companies to come crumbling down. This process has set back our medical research by decades. It shouldn’t exist in a fair market, it is literally a tool of the wealthy to keep people down. You dont like the stock? Buy a put. That’s fair and equal.

Edit: to clarify sec fines are like 150k 3-5 years down the road, when misclassifying is making/saving funds millions. Is just the cost of doing business, or a bribe.

2231,GME," There was a time when I was completely ignorant and thought shorting might be a niche tool for the market.  But then I started asking myself some serious questions.  

One of the questions I asked was, ""If you agreed to let someone borrow something and found out later they sold it in some crazy effort to buy it back at a lower price, how would you react?""  My answer was, ""I would be PISSED OFF!""  Firstly, I would never agree to have any borrowed objects sold for any reason.  Second, the object I borrow in question will more often than not have more value than the value its sold for, which often means that this idea burns the borrower when they pay more than they sold it for.  

Finally, there's this idea going around that doing this kind of trading stabilizes the market and helps prevent crazy spikes in demand, and I find that to be definitively false on the securities side.  If you friend agreed to let you borrow his PS5 so you could sell it then buy it back for a profit, 99 times out of 100 you'll be the one who gets burned because you sold it at the wrong price, the fees kill your profit or your friend forces you to buy it back.  As for securities, the ongoing instability with GME and other highly praised stocks proves shorting doesn't help stabilize crap, and that 99 shorts out of 100 got burned because they shorted at the wrong price, the borrowing fees kill their profits or the margin calls forced them to buy it back.

If a given stock was at the maximum possible price it could sell for on the market, then theoretically, I might be open to the idea of shorting if the stock was within 90% or so of the maximum price allowable, the stock could not be split to lower the price, and the margin risk of reaching the maximum price was acceptable to the broker.  But that's all nonsense, the truth is if I had power over the laws in the market, I would make shorting illegal because it does more harm than good.",Raiqchan,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nu47k3/shorting_is_not_bad_not_going_away/h0xxx7u/,0.177,0.698,0.125,-0.9777

Practically every stock is being shorted.  INO as an example, has never once released a product and has never once finished a vaccine despite always being in the race every time a pandemic hits.  It was a huge BUY here on this sub a while back despite their borderline fraudulent behavior simply because ""STONK IS BIG SHARTED, BUY BUY BUY"".

What about this is healthy?  If the company is fraudulent, just don't buy shares.  If the company is failing, just don't buy shares.  If you already have shares and you see that the company is a fraud, sell your shares.  If shareholders sell and buyers aren't willing to buy at higher prices, the value goes down.  Simple as that.  Fraudulent companies don't need shares sold short to be exposed.

And it's still worth it to expose fraudulent companies because puts exist.  Exposing the fraud from INO?  Get puts.  Is the IV too high?  Then wait a bit for it to drop before releasing the report.

2340,DCF," I can't imagine anyone buying right before the dividend in order to get it.  All that does is create taxable gains which funds generally want to avoid.  It doesn't create any profit because the stock drops by the amount of the dividend when it goes ex-div.

There are lots of good reasons the invest (the stock is hugely undervalued given its present and future earnings -- a DCF amalysis suggests that it's worth at least 2x what it's trading for) but buying just to get the dividend is a pretty dumb move -- there is no way Vanguard, or any other big fund, is doing this.",Keith_13,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nuhu4k/uwmc_is_this_time_to_finally_move_the_bull/h0y6s2x/,0.091,0.792,0.117,0.025

Mat Ishbia. NCAA 2000 Tournament champion, Mat Ishbia. He owns a 69% stake in the company (nice). Bloomberg news service estimates his personal fortune at $9.42 billion, ranking him as the world’s 244th richest person. Yet he still credits Spartan basketball coach Tom Izzo, along with his father, lawyer Jeff Ishbia, as the mentors most responsible for his position today. Still showing his love for the game, UWMC just announced that they are the exclusive mortgage partners of the Detroit Pistons.  
“There's no detail too small. I know exactly what the sales team is doing … If you start to outsource the little things, the big things don't get taken care of. So we focus on every detail of the business. Another one is to outwork everybody.

I don't have our people work like that, but I'm here at 4 in the morning and out at 6:30 at night. Izzo used to say this: ""I'm not the best X-and-Os coach, but I'm going to outwork everyone.' I'm not as smart as Jamie Dimon. I don't have as much money as Dan Gilbert. Whatever it may be. But I can work three hours more a day than them, and if I do that for 18 years, I'm going to eventually catch them. And that's what we've been doing."" -Mat Ishbia

r/wallstreetbets likes it (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)  
Even fucking r/dividends likes it (very informative thread, tl;dr: boomers say it's a 10 year hold)  
Everybody fucking loves this stock. If you think I cherrypicked threads, google “UWMC stock reddit” and open up the first 50 reddit threads. Read every comment on every one. Everybody. fucking. loves. this. stock. apes.. boomers.. value investors.. whatever the fuck the r/stockmarket people are called, they all like it. Plus a lot of these threads calling this a steal are from when this was at $11+/ share. currently at $9. This thing could go up 20% tomorrow and it would still be a steal.  
**Price target**  
This is a $15-18 stock trading at $9. My bull case: current fair value of $20. Easily $40 by 2023, wouldn’t be surprised to see $60+. If this squeezes, we could see that in the next few months.  
**Bear case**  
The main one I see is the debt, but even that is not so bad. They do have a sizeable amount of debt, see chart above. But the Fed will do anything and everything to preserve rates. This precious stock market will be caudled all the way to UWMC $60. So the debt is not such a bad thing. They’re betting on themselves and the Fed isn't stepping in. They’re invested in the future of this company, and the revenue growth makes me less worried about this.  
**Catalyst**  
Ok so what’s the catalyst for the pop?  
1. What was the catalyst in BB/AMC/SENS/WKHS popping? People saw the short interest? Probably, but not sure. I think people just need to look at it and say would you look at this. I think shorters are now scared to get involved with reddit stocks, so WSB interest in this could scare them out. As we’ve seen with all the other stonks, once the shorts are out, the sky is the limit  
2. Check out this DD by u/icedknee, on how Wall Street’s top brokers are quietly tightening their rules for who can bet against retail traders’ most-popular stocks. “Now the hedge funds can’t keep adding to their position at higher prices to avoid getting margin called.” Once it starts to run, it’s gone. These upward movements are going to be a snowball effect.  
3. Dividend this week, people are going to want in before that. plus it’s on 6/9 lol  
4. UWMC had a mishap in getting their stock listen on the Russel index. There is a lot up in the air as to if/ when it might be listed, and question marks around this inclusion. Once the dust settles, a listing on the Russel could start the snowball in motion. From u/ swamipro, “1. Institutions have been shying away from adding the stock because they view the inclusion as not guaranteed- Fintel is showing about a 30% institutional ownership-only 10% increase from May 15th- added stocks are at least at 60%. Folks don't fully grasp how much pressure this is...Excited about a $300 million buyback over 2 years? Institutions have to buy 25 million shares over 15 trading days!”  
5. Buyback. I don’t see it staying this low for that long. They've said they think the stock is a steal at current prices (which were $7) so I could see more of the aforementioned buyback happening sooner rather than later, as the run up appears to have started.  
6. Quad witching. Did you feel that? that’s 70% of WSB wincing. “This time will be different” ™️. For apes: quadruple witching refers to the third Friday of every March, June, September and December. On these days, derivatives (e.g. market index futures, options futures, stock options, stock futures) expire, usually resulting in increased volatility. With the current IV being so low (66%), even if nothing happens, calls going up. This is the IV play we talked about earlier. 6/18, mark your calendars. Or wait.. dates are already marked on your calendar.  
7. Earnings run up. Expected sometime in August/ September. Earnings expectations have already been raised once in the last 30 days, 2-3 months out. I could see this running up to earnings  
tl:dr UWMC has 20.5% short interest, insane growth compared to peers, static stock relative to peers (for now), 5% dividend, great financials, low IV (for now), plus half of WSB already fucking owns the stock. tons of bag holders waiting to be saved.

1. What was the catalyst in BB/AMC/SENS/WKHS popping? People saw the short interest? Probably, but not sure. I think people just need to look at it and say would you look at this. I think shorters are now scared to get involved with reddit stocks, so WSB interest in this could scare them out. As we’ve seen with all the other stonks, once the shorts are out, the sky is the limit  
2. Check out this DD by u/icedknee, on how Wall Street’s top brokers are quietly tightening their rules for who can bet against retail traders’ most-popular stocks. “Now the hedge funds can’t keep adding to their position at higher prices to avoid getting margin called.” Once it starts to run, it’s gone. These upward movements are going to be a snowball effect.  
3. Dividend this week, people are going to want in before that. plus it’s on 6/9 lol  
4. UWMC had a mishap in getting their stock listen on the Russel index. There is a lot up in the air as to if/ when it might be listed, and question marks around this inclusion. Once the dust settles, a listing on the Russel could start the snowball in motion. From u/ swamipro, “1. Institutions have been shying away from adding the stock because they view the inclusion as not guaranteed- Fintel is showing about a 30% institutional ownership-only 10% increase from May 15th- added stocks are at least at 60%. Folks don't fully grasp how much pressure this is...Excited about a $300 million buyback over 2 years? Institutions have to buy 25 million shares over 15 trading days!”  
5. Buyback. I don’t see it staying this low for that long. They've said they think the stock is a steal at current prices (which were $7) so I could see more of the aforementioned buyback happening sooner rather than later, as the run up appears to have started.  
6. Quad witching. Did you feel that? that’s 70% of WSB wincing. “This time will be different” ™️. For apes: quadruple witching refers to the third Friday of every March, June, September and December. On these days, derivatives (e.g. market index futures, options futures, stock options, stock futures) expire, usually resulting in increased volatility. With the current IV being so low (66%), even if nothing happens, calls going up. This is the IV play we talked about earlier. 6/18, mark your calendars. Or wait.. dates are already marked on your calendar.  
7. Earnings run up. Expected sometime in August/ September. Earnings expectations have already been raised once in the last 30 days, 2-3 months out. I could see this running up to earnings  
tl:dr UWMC has 20.5% short interest, insane growth compared to peers, static stock relative to peers (for now), 5% dividend, great financials, low IV (for now), plus half of WSB already fucking owns the stock. tons of bag holders waiting to be saved. Anybody know what UWMC stands for? Ultimate WSB Moon Cruise 🚀🌜",AnAccountForNews,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nuhu4k/uwmc_is_this_time_to_finally_move_the_bull/h0ye7ty/,0.058,0.815,0.126,0.9977
2362,UWMC," **$300M Buyback**  
May Q1 Earnings Quote: “As you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special dividend or a share buyback program. As you guys have seen, we concluded share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward shareholders. We announced the authorization of $300 million share buyback over the next 24 months. And quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that.” That was at a price of $7  
**CEO**  
Mat Ishbia. NCAA 2000 Tournament champion, Mat Ishbia. He owns a 69% stake in the company (nice). Bloomberg news service estimates his personal fortune at $9.42 billion, ranking him as the world’s 244th richest person. Yet he still credits Spartan basketball coach Tom Izzo, along with his father, lawyer Jeff Ishbia, as the mentors most responsible for his position today. Still showing his love for the game, UWMC just announced that they are the exclusive mortgage partners of the Detroit Pistons.  
“There's no detail too small. I know exactly what the sales team is doing … If you start to outsource the little things, the big things don't get taken care of. So we focus on every detail of the business. Another one is to outwork everybody. When I coached for a year with Izzo and saw the meticulous attention to detail and the focus he had on outworking everybody — we'd work until 1 in the morning and come back at 7 in the morning. I don't have our people work like that, but I'm here at 4 in the morning and out at 6:30 at night. Izzo used to say this: ""I'm not the best X-and-Os coach, but I'm going to outwork everyone.' I'm not as smart as Jamie Dimon. I don't have as much money as Dan Gilbert. Whatever it may be. But I can work three hours more a day than them, and if I do that for 18 years, I'm going to eventually catch them. And that's what we've been doing."" -Mat Ishbia  
**Reddit sentiment**  
Honestly, I can barely find any negative sentiment on this stock on reddit.  
r/stocks likes it (1, 2, threads)  
r/investing likes it (great thread)  
r/stockmarket likes it (""exploding stock of the week"")  
r/wallstreetbets likes it (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)  
Even fucking r/dividends likes it (very informative thread, tl;dr: boomers say it's a 10 year hold)  
Everybody fucking loves this stock. If you think I cherrypicked threads, google “UWMC stock reddit” and open up the first 50 reddit threads. Read every comment on every one. Everybody. fucking. loves. this. stock. apes.. boomers.. value investors.. whatever the fuck the r/stockmarket people are called, they all like it. Plus a lot of these threads calling this a steal are from when this was at $11+/ share. currently at $9. This thing could go up 20% tomorrow and it would still be a steal.  
**Price target**  
This is a $15-18 stock trading at $9. My bull case: current fair value of $20. Easily $40 by 2023, wouldn’t be surprised to see $60+. If this squeezes, we could see that in the next few months.  
**Bear case**  
The main one I see is the debt, but even that is not so bad. They do have a sizeable amount of debt, see chart above. But the Fed will do anything and everything to preserve rates. This precious stock market will be caudled all the way to UWMC $60. So the debt is not such a bad thing. They’re betting on themselves and the Fed isn't stepping in. They’re invested in the future of this company, and the revenue growth makes me less worried about this.

3068,AMC," It kind of follows it a bit cause of the association as others have mentioned. 

However, GME’s market cap is 2.5x as large as BB’s. AMC’s is 3.5x as large. These multiples need to be applied to BB appropriately with the buy and sell orders + options trading to reflect the same *magnitude* of movement. This means that 2/5ths of the volume vs GME and 2/7ths of the volume vs AMC. In other words, it takes way less to move the price of BB.

Now this is where I get a bit perplexed… BB has been the lead ticker in this sub for the last week and is not moving at a larger magnitude relative to GME and AMC. In addition, this stock is not only a hidden gold mine but also has its dick beaten down for 5 months straight. Just my honest opinion, but I see WAY more promise in terms of future growth and value a few years down the line compared to most amped up stocks in this sub. BB is the play. Always has been. Many are realizing now that this company has a short term opportunity with very minimal downside in the long term. It’s the perfect place to park money for massive returns. HOWEVER, the *magnitude* of these movements in BB are not 2.5-3.5x larger than GME and AMC. That is very very weird. Perhaps buy and sell indicators for day traders are being primarily based off of AMC is my theory. 

This is all going to change though! I am sure most of you dumb asses know recently it has followed suit of AMC, but I don’t think it will anymore for long, but instead it will break free and find it’s own pattern. I actually think it will end up being the leading pattern pretty soon here. More and more people will realize that BB can make way more money from this point forward. It has only doubled from it’s low a few weeks back. AMC has grown substantially more than this. 

Would you rather FOMO into AMC that already exploded or get into BB before it has exploded? Why can’t we see this shift in sentiment reflected into the market cap of BB? If it were to catch up to AMC’s current market cap, that would make it priced in at $55+ per share. PLUS, this isn’t even a fair comparison because AMC as a company does not have the same promise in the future as BB. It could go way way higher than $55 per share. 

PS. I think AMC still has room to grow but I see better opportunity with new money in BB from what I discussed above.

I looked up FIGS on the popular garment wholesale distributors sites and didn’t find them. In a way, that’s bullish because once they get distribution their sales will 🚀 - but it’s also bearish because it suggests they don’t have production capacity to handle wholesale distribution yet. 

If they can get garment decorators (the people who embroider the doctor’s name on it) to sell/promote their products, then they can sell a whole lot more without paying anyone to do it. Looks like they handle all their customization in house now though.

""***It would make more sense for AMZN to acquire a regional drug retailer like RAD to quickly establish a physical presence***.""

Also, it should be noted that there is already a partnership existing between Amazon and Rite Aid since July of 2019. Rite Aid was the first partner that Amazon selected for its retail in-store pick-up program called Amazon Counter. Here is the link for the launch of the program:

So the companies are already coordinating some business activities to a minor extent.

Finally, with the acquisition of Bartell Drugs, Rite Aid became the #1 retail pharmacy in Seattle, WA. Should Amazon buyout Rite Aid, AMZN itself would be able to cut out the middleman and provide cost effective prescription drug benefits to its 75,000 employees at the Seattle headquarters.

**Walmart**

Walmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company. However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens. In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale. If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over. WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.

A couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:

Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions thereby lowering its overall drug cost, improving profitability

All the goods sold in the front-end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products Walmart sells in its own department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.

Based on the above 2 points, Walmart would improve both its own existing margins and at the same time would improve those of the Rite Aid revenue through such an acquisition.

The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.

If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $4 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels. So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payback on the investment.

Whichever company, Walmart or Amazon, utlimately decides to buy Rite Aid, that corporation will instantly become the #3 retail pharmacy in the USA, and will be well-positioned to someday challenge CVS and Walgreens for the #1 or #2 spots.

**Walgreens**

Another darkhorse in this whole race is Walgreens. This week, Walgreens completed the sale of its Alliance Healthcare businesses to AmerisourceBergen for $6.5 billion (---see link below this paragraph). This windfall gives WBA the needed funds to finally finish the takeover of Rite Aid that it started back in 2015. While that deal was ultimately blocked by the courts, no judge could reasonably claim today that there is insufficent competition to support consumers if the balance of Rite Aid was taken over by Walgreens (NOTE: WBA bought 1,900+ RAD stores in 2018, and RAD currently has 2,500+ stores remaining). With CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Kroger, and numberous mail order prescription services (including Amazon), there is pleny of competition in the USA.

An acquisition of Rite Aid by Walgreens would be a highly strategic move accomplishing the following:

\- Gaining more size and scale, thereby putting WBA in a much more competitive position with CVS

\- Giving Walgreens a PBM in Rite Aid's Elixir group that would help WBA gain more prescription drug business share compete more successfully in that category

\- Blocking both Amazon ( $AMZN ) and Walmart ( $WMT ) from acquiring Rite Aid thereby removing the threat of a financially powerful competitor moving into the #3 retail pharmacy spot in the USA.
