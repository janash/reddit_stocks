0,HNW," You and every one else in this thread seem to misunderstand the goal of a lot of these funds. They don’t beat the market a lot of times because they aren’t designed to. They are designed to make risk adjusted returns when compared to the market. In a year the S&P does 17%, maybe they’re up 8%. In a year the S&P does -12% they’re down 4%. Hedge funds, before some people bastardized them as high risk vehicles that are more akin to betting, were about reducing risk for HNW individuals looking to park money and preserve wealth. Most still do that. Now, why does this matter? Because you don’t know the fund managers goals. Maybe they have massive inherited wealth they want to hold onto and investing in a low-risk fund is a good move for them. That sucks for you, because your capital is going to be chewed up via fees while not realizing returns because you don’t have the same goals as him. Almost all retail investors are better off investing in indexes or individual securities than going the active fund route because your goals are typically about wealth creation rather than preservation.",kdrisck,7,/r/investing/comments/m01mob/finding_funds_where_managers_have_skin_in_the_game/gq6l8ix/,0.067,0.816,0.116,0.8599

2,CEO," > Abstract

> We unpack the concept of managerial risk taking, distinguishing among three of its major elements: the size of an outlay, the variance of potential outcomes, and the likelihood of extreme loss. We then apply our framework in hypothesizing the effects of CEO stock options on strategic behavior and company performance. We find that CEO stock options engender high levels of investment outlays and bring about extreme corporate performance (big gains and big losses), suggesting that stock options prompt CEOs to make high-variance bets, not simply larger bets. Finally, we find that option-loaded CEOs deliver more big losses than big gains.

CEOs that hold more stock/options in their company take bigger risks and yield lower returns. Might also be true for fund managers?

7,PM," I don’t think you have a good handle on how PMs for index funds are paid. They are rewarded not on performance, but on keeping variance to a minimum. Variance is a measure of how closely their funds track the market. The reason this is important is because in the event their holdings are outsize compared to the index, either too big or too small a position, the firm has to rebalance the fund and incur associated sales expenses. The lower a variance, the bigger the PM bonus, because it means the firm is pocketing more of the fees paid by the shareholder. So your concern is unfounded, because the expense ratios don’t change QtQ, it’s just a question of how much the firm nets from those fees after expenses.",kdrisck,2,/r/investing/comments/m01mob/finding_funds_where_managers_have_skin_in_the_game/gq6kihh/,0.021,0.895,0.083,0.802
8,HAS," It's considered a ""backdoor"" roth ira contribution.

Even I have to do it.. the limits are lower than most people would expect around $140k/year.


You contribute the money into a tradtional IRA so that taxes are paid on the money, then you roll it into a Roth IRA. The benefit being, you now don't owe money on any gains and there's no RMDs or cap on withdrawing. 



In general, i'd say it's probably questionable if it's worth it or not. For me, it absolutely has been.

10,IMO," It's on Cathie's LinkedIn. She states herself she co-started a hedge fund in 1998..and left in 2001.

Unfortunately there is no performance data available. ARK's info about Cathie states that her fund reached $800+ billion in 2000.

Let me be clear, I have no proof the fund crashed and burned in 2001..but I find the timing of when she started the hedge fund and left interesting. Also note she advertises total assets under management from 2000, which would be at the height of the bubble. Make whatever conclusions you will with that. 

Note that after she left that hedge fund, she went to work at Alliance Bearstein. From what I can see in Morningstar, her performance was unremarkable.. Unless I am missing something. Only fund I found history for is this fund she managed from 2008-2013, and it underperformed both index and category for that period. https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/altfx/performance.

ARKK itself underperformed Vanguard's Technology ETF in all years but 2017 and 2020. Can you guess what was her biggest contributor to outperformance in 2017? Check Arkk's quarterly reports for details, but it was their ""investment"" in bitcoin.

My personal take on Cathie is that she isn't a con artist or anything like that, but she is trying to be the next JP Morgan... Not simply buying companies like other fund managers, but partnering with them.. using her great marketing ability to solicit inflows and ""pump up"" the valuation on those companies. This in turn helps those companies to raise more cash and be successful. She absolutely was instrumental in elevating Tesla's valuation and helping them raise billions of dollars as a result, which is great for them and the EV industry. JP Morgan did the same thing with rail and electricity back in the day.

Here's the catch, can YOU make bank by following Cathie? JP Morgan lived in a different era. He took advantage of the nearly complete lack of antitrust laws to kill competitors and make his companies monopolies. Tesla will not be a monopoly..batteries will be a commodity and Toyota will come for their EV business.

IMO Cathie has intentionally or not made a pump scheme. And she is being irresponsible IMO by advertising she will double your money in 5 years... this is pulling in short minded investors. I don't understand why she doesn't close her fund to new inflows. See T Rowe New Horizons, a very successful innovation fund that has crushed the S&P 500 for over 20 years, they have been closed to new inflows for years to protect existing shareholders.

41,GM," > all they have to do is supply

You say that like it's easy. Building out a global supply chain that can reliably make millions of cars a year is tough and Tesla are still a good ways behind companies like Toyota, Ford, GM, or Honda.

At this point it's clear that Tesla has cemented themselves as one of the big players in the automotive industry, but them being valued at more than all of their competitors combined seems a but insane to me.

I whole heartedly agree that Tesla is the front runner by a good margin when it comes to EV technology, but they're still pretty far behind on production numbers. Even if they double the number of cars they produce every single year (which would be miraculous) it'll still be 4 years before they're in the range that Honda, Toyota, or Ford are.

I'm sure you'll disagree, but I'm of the belief that at least one of Tesla's competitors will catch up with them from a technology perspective (either through R&D or partnerships) before Tesla can get to a point where they're producing 5 million cars a year.",Drugba,3,/r/investing/comments/m0fk5u/news_david_tepper_is_getting_bullish_on_stocks/gq92xxa/,0.041,0.817,0.143,0.9562
42,GM," The issue with Ford and GM IMO is that they are soooo big.  It is very difficult for them to make changes to their assembly lines -much less completely alter them for an EV.  The big guys are not nimble.  You may have a point that they might buy their way in to the party, but it will be very challenging for the big boys to move to EVs organically.",Mommafed,1,/r/investing/comments/m0fk5u/news_david_tepper_is_getting_bullish_on_stocks/gq97xxv/,0.026,0.916,0.058,0.3167
43,GM," If these big companies were just now deciding that EV was the future, I'd agree with Tesla's valuation more, but most of these companies already have one or two EVs on the market. These companies are behind in the race for sure, but it's not like they're just sitting on the side lines. Pretty much every single major car company has at least one EV on the market at this point. Things like VW out selling Tesla in Europe last year are a sign that Tesla now has real competitors in the space. 

I don't think Tesla will be dethroned as the #1 EV company anytime soon, but as Ford, Honda, GM, Toyota, VW, Nissan, Hyundai, etc all release their EVs they're bound to each take a little bit of Tesla's market share which will add up. 

You're absolutely correct that they're slow to adapt and in fact, that's how Tesla became the front runner in this space, but they've been making that shift for a few years now and it's finally starting to pick up pace. Tesla basically had the market to themselves until recently as the bigger companies let them prove that there was demand for EVs. Now that it's clear that there is they all making their moves and playing catch up is a lot easier and quicker than being the leader.",Drugba,2,/r/investing/comments/m0fk5u/news_david_tepper_is_getting_bullish_on_stocks/gq9bbwy/,0.03,0.882,0.089,0.9327

* Market
* Size
* Value

Value and profitability are a bit linked, so they are the main selection criteria. Then securities with negative investment exposure are excluded.

Momentum isn't included in the fama-french 5 factor model because it doesn't have a risk based explanation.

However, the effect is so big and robust that it is probably a good idea to consider it if you need to trade anyway. So they delay buys for stocks with negative momentum and sells for stocks with positive momentum.

Stock prices change daily and a value stock can become a growth stock pretty quickly. A daily implementation would sell such a stock, a index will hold it until the next index construction occurs.

118,DD," I have done a ton of DD actually considering watching all this slowly play out.  My favorite is RCAT.  Some others in the space I have looked at also are UAVS, TAKOF, ALPP, and DFLYF.  RCAT stood out for many reasons.  First, RCAT and UAVS are the only full on revenue producing pure drone plays.  ALPP is a holding company and Drones are only a small piece of their 35-40m in revenues.  So of course, the OP would not necessarily affect them as much as a UAVS or RCAT....and especially RCAT since RCAT is approaching 12-15m which is all drone and UAVS only has 2m in revenues total per year at this point.  Another factor is RCAT is a holding company and has already completed 4 M & As to create the current company.  This approach allows them to grow much more rapidly and acquire companies where UAVS is more of a standard drone company in the Ag industry.  And finally, and most important, RCAT has a product they have been working on called DroneBox.  This product acts like a planes black box and they have been collecting thousands of flight logs and developing the software and hardware chip to run it for over 5 years.  This product has WHOLE INDUSTRY APPEAL not just a nitch area and will be compatible with any drone type and manufacturer based on their PRs.  It should be launched after all these years sometime this year.  It will should also have remote ID capabilities to tie into the soon to come FAA and NASA Drone Air Traffic Control System also that was started by the government and in development since 2015.  Anyway, RCAT is just about to uplist to NASDAQ and have applied and filed the plan of IPO funding as well as they have a 3m float and only 27m out at this point.  This is compared structurally to the others who are in the 100m range float wise. If you know anything about float you understand well on a NASDAQ upgrade what 3m float could do to a stock.  Maybe one for the record books if times just right.

The last one I mentioned was TAKOF.  This was the worst one!  It looked like a cool name and concept until you open up the financials.  It is a train wreck IMHO and being used for a personal piggy bank to the tune of 12m a year burn rate with zero revs for YEARS!  This is one that of course could be pumped if we have a drone boom but really looks like an over all scam IMHO with just a hollow shell with no significant ops regardless of any PRS or other crap they put out.  

SO, those are my thoughts!  If you want to take a closer look at RCAT there is a lot of DD at Stocktwits and someone started a reddit here recently at https://www.reddit.com/r/RedCatHoldings/  This is also a recent investors presentation they just released in the past week.

This product has WHOLE INDUSTRY APPEAL not just a nitch area and will be compatible with any drone type and manufacturer based on their PRs.  It should be launched after all these years sometime this year.  It will should also have remote ID capabilities to tie into the soon to come FAA and NASA Drone Air Traffic Control System also that was started by the government and in development since 2015.  Anyway, RCAT is just about to uplist to NASDAQ and have applied and filed the plan of IPO funding as well as they have a 3m float and only 27m out at this point.  This is compared structurally to the others who are in the 100m range float wise. If you know anything about float you understand well on a NASDAQ upgrade what 3m float could do to a stock.  Maybe one for the record books if times just right.

The last one I mentioned was TAKOF.  This was the worst one!  It looked like a cool name and concept until you open up the financials.  It is a train wreck IMHO and being used for a personal piggy bank to the tune of 12m a year burn rate with zero revs for YEARS!  This is one that of course could be pumped if we have a drone boom but really looks like an over all scam IMHO with just a hollow shell with no significant ops regardless of any PRS or other crap they put out.  

SO, those are my thoughts!  If you want to take a closer look at RCAT there is a lot of DD at Stocktwits and someone started a reddit here recently at https://www.reddit.com/r/RedCatHoldings/  This is also a recent investors presentation they just released in the past week.

120,PRS," I have done a ton of DD actually considering watching all this slowly play out.  My favorite is RCAT.  Some others in the space I have looked at also are UAVS, TAKOF, ALPP, and DFLYF.  RCAT stood out for many reasons.  First, RCAT and UAVS are the only full on revenue producing pure drone plays.  ALPP is a holding company and Drones are only a small piece of their 35-40m in revenues.  So of course, the OP would not necessarily affect them as much as a UAVS or RCAT....and especially RCAT since RCAT is approaching 12-15m which is all drone and UAVS only has 2m in revenues total per year at this point.  Another factor is RCAT is a holding company and has already completed 4 M & As to create the current company.  This approach allows them to grow much more rapidly and acquire companies where UAVS is more of a standard drone company in the Ag industry.

127,GME," I don’t know WTF is happening with GameStop, other than people with far more money and cleverness than me are playing games with the market that are way above my level.

But I will say, to the extent that the bump is tied to Ryan Cohen, it’s an overreaction. Cohen was able to strike gold with Chewy because Chewy hit an in-demand market with no real competition in the digital field. 

GameStop is a company with tons of liabilities that is trying to pivot from brick and mortar to e-commerce about ten years too late and is now entering a field that is stuffed to the brim with competition. And not just any competition. We are talking giants like Amazon and Walmart, all of whom have ten year head starts. And none of that speaks to first party, direct to consumer, distribution from storefronts owned and maintained by manufacturers such as Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft. 

GME might be able to break into the e-commerce field under Cohen’s leadership. But the reactionary take of “Ryan Cohen made Chewy so he will save GameStop!” is stupidly simplistic, bordering on idol worship and a total lack of understanding of (or willful ignorance toward) the many differences between Chewy and GameStop.",MattTheSmithers,9,/r/investing/comments/m0ckrk/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gq7xesw/,0.088,0.832,0.08,-0.2258

156,BB," Outside the ETF, what analyses did you do on the stocks?  As I look at PLUG and they have not returned a profit in 25 years of existence - always a lot of hype.  

BB has great technology and a good patent estate - I would hold.

None of these others seem to payout a dividend or at least nothing that I saw recently. I get having things that dont. Because simply put they can double or triple in price.  And make you a lot of money.

However. If you sell before 1 year you pay capital gains. ( US ) after 1 year I think its 23%. So not bad after the year.

But with a lot of these listed just for tech they may never make you more than 10 to 100$ per share than what you buy.

For MSFT. if you have 4 shares ( 1000$ ) you may or may not ever see that go up by more than 40 to 60$. so you make a mind breaking 240$.

Look for stocks, ETF and Index that have a dividend. Drip that into more shares so that the Small increase in the long run comes back as more. Rather than just the 4 you got, you might have 8 to 12 at the end. Maybe more.

However. If you sell before 1 year you pay capital gains. ( US ) after 1 year I think its 23%. So not bad after the year.

But with a lot of these listed just for tech they may never make you more than 10 to 100$ per share than what you buy.

For MSFT. if you have 4 shares ( 1000$ ) you may or may not ever see that go up by more than 40 to 60$. so you make a mind breaking 240$.

Look for stocks, ETF and Index that have a dividend. Drip that into more shares so that the Small increase in the long run comes back as more. Rather than just the 4 you got, you might have 8 to 12 at the end. Maybe more.

217,JNJ," The “competitive advantage” you mentioned seems to have shifted to JNJ, not only because of the existence of its one-dose regimen, but because that efficacy is a “floor” of what we can expect from JNJ’s two-dose regimen, for which phase 3 trials are underway. 

Think of it this way: JNJ proved that its one-dose vaccine is “good enough” by a pretty decent margin. If the two-dose regimen is even more successful and approaches or exceeds Pfitzer/Moderna’s efficacy under the same variant conditions, everyone would switch to JNJ and ditch the others (it’s cheaper, easier to store and transport). So at a minimum, JNJ has a successful competitor that will draw significant market share away. Best-case scenario (for JNJ), in the coming months, it can provide an even more effective two-dose regimen which has been proven to still be highly effective if the second dose isn’t taken (which is possible/even probable in many communities).",minneDomer,2,/r/investing/comments/m0l36g/moderna_continues_to_slide_despite_news/gq8yt3u/,0.0,0.807,0.193,0.9886

Things I don't know,  since the MRNA is a set of instructions to use the ribosome to manufacture proteins and build the parts,  are they protected from generics?  Next, the government was uncertain about MRNA delivery, now that they approved the vaccine will future MRNA treatments be approved faster?

252,DD," So, before I get into what strategy I would do, I'm going to recommend some educational resources for you incase you need them. So first is investor.gov, which has a great getting started section, aswell as being all round a great website for investing ""safe"", next is investopedia, which is like the Wikipedia for investing, but also as a great education section full of great articles. Finally the one I recommend the most is khan academy, which has some really spectacular videos on all things related to the stock market. Ok so now for my strategy, what I would do is split your money (not necessarily evenly) between three different stocks/ETFs, so the first one would be your stable stock/ETF, (example VOO)where you just set it and forget it. Next is your dividend one, where it should be sort of stable but with high dividends (example VYM), and now with your new found dividends I'd reinvest back into your stable and the following. The following is what usually is a individual stock, but could be an etf. So the following would be something that you really believe in, something that you think is undervalued and will grow. This doesn't necessarily have to be 100% safe, as you have your stable stock and to a extent your dividend stock to rely on. So an example would be Sony, which is a company I feel really passionate about on which I  made a DD that I can share wit you if you would like. So , in summary, my strategy would be a very low risk etf, low risk dividend stock/etf and sort of risky stock/etf which you believe will grow faster than your stable and the market in general.

292,AI," I agree with you. Personally I think it highly depends on the government's decision. And there are a few factors in the ""national security"" conern. 

The current technology node from intel is enough to support the military. However, if AI starts to come into play, it may not be enough. 

The shortage at the commercial side can cause economic damage and can also escalate to national security issue. And this is the best hope Intel has. Again, their technology is still good, and more than enough for a lot of applications. They just need to open their fabs for third party design (or even to offer design service for custom chip).

So I think there's potential for Intel. Decision is on them to put in the money and resources to make it happen and the government can help on that.

For bearish side, my belief is on the CPU front. If they can't keep up with the technology advancement, they will be behind in performance, power, and cost, which is deadly in the CPU market.

297,CEO," Is possible but will take years. I don’t think a lot of people understand how long the cycle is to upgrade fabs/build new fabs/develop the next gen technology. The scary thing is this is turning into a virtuous cycle for TSMC, the more orders they get the more they invest in their fabs. Intel just simply can’t keep up with that R&D budget that is pure play fab technology.

Personally I think they will throw in the towel and outsource to TSMC in the next year unless Uncle Sam steps in. I’m bearish on them, even with Gelsinger coming in. Krzanich (the CEO before Swan) entire Intel background was in fabs and tech dev and even he couldn’t retain their lead.

Edit: While I’m bearish on Intel the reason has more to do with cloud service providers going their own way to develop proprietary chips. Same with Apple in their laptop line.

301,AMD," Dennard scaling died, that's why we use FinFETs today. Smaller transistors are no longer more power-efficient, or cheaper for that matter, since FinFETs are much more complicated to make than a planar MOSFET. Each new process node these days no longer tries to make the transistors smaller, but rather, they make the FinFETs more complicated so that they use less power for the same performance, to emulate Dennard scaling. The only problem with this is that making the transistors more complicated also makes them more expensive.

This is also why AMD is doing so well, they realized that newer transistors are more expensive (didn't used to be true when Dennard scaling was still alive) so they moved to only manufacturing the most important transistors on the newer process while keeping the remaining transistors on an older, cheaper process. If the newer process were cheaper, then they would have been better off making the entire chip on the newer process.",jmlinden7,1,/r/investing/comments/m0cz1m/us_semiconductor_fab_companies/gq9a7iv/,0.052,0.862,0.086,0.7783
302,AMD," Short term, their current product aren't good compared to the competition. Not that it matters though, AMD can secure very little of the tsmc capacity, they can't put enough of their stuff on the market which means that Intel's product, even though inferior, will sell out anyway.

The big bet for them is at the end of the year as i said. If they have another delay or their 10nm are a disappointment after all these years, then you can expect a massive sell off. Which would be a good bargain again since their 7nm that comes after that seem to be solid. If they can finally deliver on the 10nm, it would be a big win for them and time to cash on some gains",Uesugi1989,1,/r/investing/comments/m0cz1m/us_semiconductor_fab_companies/gq89oj9/,0.104,0.808,0.088,-0.2928
303,AMD," Yeah I know it's been reported by various outlets without any official confirmation from TSMC or Intel.  But humor me a bit :P

We're in the midst of a global chip shortage, which will go on until early 2022 at least.  TSMC can barely keep up with its current customers like Nvidia, AMD (No shortage on Apple since they seem to have priority).  I find it unlikely, TSMC would push aside their existing loyal customers for Intel who in the future may even cancel the work and go back to making their own chips.

Intel isn't a small customer either.  TSMC produces maybe 10 million wafers per year, and Intel maybe 3.  To foot Intel's production line is a 33% increase in wafer capacity, which is easily 60 billion dollars worth of factory spending.  I doubt TSMC can get that up and running anytime soon.  Intel would also have to go all in with TSMC.  There is no way they could produce 14 nm in their own fabs while sourcing some 5 nm to TSMC.  Once a 5 nm Core i7 hits newegg, all 14 nm i7s are worthless.

I didn't see your Edit text, but that actually hits the nail right on the head on another point I am thinking.  It is true that software companies are designing their own proprietary ASICs for machine learning and super computing which poses a great threat to Intel.  However though I think there could be a good opportunity too.  ASICs do not need to be on the latest gen process and many successful ones like the Google TPU are produced on older gen processes.  I think Intel could split off their company into a design company and fab (like Samsung) with the former outsourcing manufacturing to other advanced foundries and the latter offering manufacturing to ASIC designers.",c00750ny3h,2,/r/investing/comments/m0cz1m/us_semiconductor_fab_companies/gq7swhl/,0.044,0.801,0.155,0.9896

305,GM," That is correct. They are few key points that made me believe that Tesla can achieve my assumption.

1. **Superior self-driving capability**. Among other competitors in this space, Waymo and Cruise are the ones that look the most promising. But their technology is based on labeling every single object in that city. No doubt that is the safest way to do it, but it comes with a much greater cost and the scalability of such tech is questionable. Tesla's self-driving is more affordable and scalable. The superior self-driving capability will continue to attract new EV buyers.
2. **Competitive Pricing.** I believe Tesla will continue to enjoy the economy of scale by having its own factories. For companies like Ford and GM, even if they have the cash, it may not be in the best interest of their shareholders to go all out to compete with Tesla. For the newcomers, we will still have to wait and see which of them can actually scale up production and compete with the big guys. I am confident in Tesla's ability to offer a competitive price while maintaining a high margin for future growth.",MisterBing18,-11,/r/investing/comments/m043mq/supercharing_your_portfolio_with_tesla/gq607b6/,0.028,0.767,0.205,0.9912
