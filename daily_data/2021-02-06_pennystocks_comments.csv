4,DD," Always have an exit strategy. Kept hearing this on this sub but never actually planned ahead. Depending on my confidence in the DD I‚Äôve done and the potential of the stock I‚Äôll set a percentage gain I believe is appropriate and sell once I reach that percentage regardless of fomo. Typically when I do this the stock will continue to rise afterwards but if it‚Äôs a stock I believe has real long term potential I‚Äôll leave a few shares with house money. 

Another hard lesson learned just recently is to never sell for a loss if you‚Äôve done your DD and are even semi confident in the stock. Set a stop loss limit.

I bought a decent amount of ¬£GDR - is a company called Genedrive and they have developed a rapid Covid test and recently signed a deal with Beckman to distribute it in the US. I bought some stock at 0.80 and some more at about 0.90. Yesterday it has hitting 1.0 but I think it still had a way to go as it's still quite under the radar. I put in about 1k and gonna leave it at that, I am hoping it goes to maybe 5.0 or more, stocks to do with Covid can go on to do quite well.

I also bought another one called MVR  Melody VR, they do online and virtual music shows and concerts. They just bought Rhapsody and will be changing their name to Napster. I bought at 0.03 (though only put in ¬£200) and I feel that there is a good chance that the price will shoot up once the name is changed to Napster. Also they seem to have a lot of private backing as they were a le to acquire other companies.

If you day trade meaning you don‚Äôt hold stocks a year, always deduct 20% from each gain. It will save you a headache. Investopedia.com has a lot of information. I made the
Mistake and my tax return was reduced accordingly. IRS always knows.

Edit: I was incorrect in my initial answer as corrected below. It will be taxed as income.

The way I see it, throwing $100 for a million shares at .0001, given you do your DD and believe in the product, the growth coupled with non-expiring shares makes sense.

124,THC," Anybody looking at XXII?  


Their FDA-approved, VLN (very low nicotine) cigarette contains 95% less nicotine compared to regular cigarettes and is awaiting FDA marketing approval which can happen anytime now (big catalyst ahead). They are also a hemp stock using the same technology to guarantee 0% THC levels in their hemp crop. This is huge for farmers as the cannabis wave is set to hit the US this year under the current administration. A big problem for small farmers today is a federal law that says any crop with THC levels over 0.3% has to be destroyed. As farmers can\`t control the THC levels of their crop this poses a too big of a risk for smaller farmers as their crop may turn out illegal and therefore useless. Therefore, only big companies are able to take this risk as they have the capital to do so. With their biotech, 22nd century group can give smaller farmers an insurance in the form of their technology, by guaranteeing 0% THC levels.

Have you ever heard of a tech startup with a small team that hasn't launched yet with a $6 BILLION valuation? It's insane. 90% of startups fail, and a very very very small fraction of those startups ever reach a valuation of one billion, let alone $6 billion. I'm in it for the ride, but this could crash back to reality at any minute once the hype fades and people actually understand what they own.

It kind of sucks because Humbl could be a great app that brings in millions in revenue. But living up to a $6B valuation out the gate is going to make things tougher for them.",AnUninterestingEvent,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/ldi1bk/where_all_my_tsnp_fam_at/gm7kbg3/,0.095,0.837,0.067,-0.4809

327,DD," I started trading about 6 months ago. I‚Äôm not looking to day trade or swing trade although I enjoy learning about both. I prefer to take long positions and have no problem holding through dips if nothing fundamentally has changed about the company and I still believe in the DD preceding the buy in. 

As others have noted the market is favorable for pennys right now. I‚Äôve never known it any other way since I‚Äôm new. My first penny stock was OZSC and I‚Äôm currently up 3000% on it so I have beginners luck. I‚Äôve also taken up positions in TLSS, TSNP, INND, CBBT and SNPW. Those have treated me great so far. 

My question is since a large portion of the penny stocks mentioned on this board are doing well can anyone give me recent examples of a stock that started in the low cents then raised up to .50 or more then completely crashed? I‚Äôd like to go over those charts or see the reasons why the stock did not succeed. I‚Äôm having a hard time coming up with exit plans as I just want to continue to hold as my current positions are having success.

328,DD," Hey all, relatively new here. Been a lurker for a while, just joined. I've been looking closely at TYME, which recently had a run up and then a huge pull back down to $2.32 on news of a $100M direct offering. I think the pullback was significantly overblown, and this still has a lot of room to run.

Current analyst price target is between $8-$9, and the $100M direct offering was sold for $2.50/share. This means if you buy it now, you can get it for LESS than the institutions JUST PAID. I haven't really seen anyone talking about this stock, but I think there's definitely some opportunity here. The company is focusing on low toxicity cancer therapies that have shown to reduce tumors, and prolon life expectancy in treated cancer patients. They also have been doing some work developing a COVID-19 therapy drug that significantly reduces the symptoms during the illness. 

Would love to get your guys thoughts on this. I've been doing as much DD as I can, and the main fault I can find is they're pre-revenue, and their cash burn rate is only $6.5M/quarter, they had $19M in cash at the last financial update two days ago. But they just raised $100M,so I think they've got plenty of cash to sustain their research efforts and get to that $8-9 range over the next few months, which is a 387% upside from current levels.

Edit 1: The recent run up was from news that the USPTO granted them their patent on their COVID-19 treatment.

368,DD," TEAR ME TO SHREDS!  Please..

So, i am one of the brand new investors as of this week and outside of buy low sell high know nothing about the finer details of investing.

40 years old, about 80k in cash doing nothing for me except losing money over time to inflation. another 20k in a 401k that i put 12% into. 

not married, one adult child finishing college this year. i do not own a home, have 0 debt outside of my car payment and live an extremely frugal lifestyle.

i make between 80-90k a year, with 100k possible 

Plan to buy some land with a friend in 3-5 years, build some tiny homes (ourselves)

and airbnb as passive income. i figure to need about 50k for that,  25k for the land and 25k for the tiny home.

which, just based on what i have now would leave around 30k for investing.

As i do not need the cash i want to try and put as much money in to the market as i can for this year, so about a minimum of an additional 1k a month.  

With that being said, i want to go all in on cannabis with a smaller interest in nickel and renewable energy.

My self adopted high risk strategy is to try and buy into as many cannabis companies as i can and roll the dice,  i do like penny stocks as both for a potential lottery ticket as well as long term hold, at least for cannabis

 I will toss some money at a meme stock if i can get in low enough, just for funsies.

My first week i invested in 35 positions for a total of around 6g., which i know is a lot of stocks to have.  I have the time and have really enjoyed DD, though , outside of checking if they have a website and upcoming catalysts i have yet to dig deeper than that as i need to learn to read financials and such.  yes i know it is a high risk putting money into something without in depth vetting into themoney side, i just feel cannabis and nickel have absolutely no where to go but up for the next 10 years and the initial boom will be so huge once they can start using banks.  I am investing under the premise of off schedule 1, federally legal medical and decriminalization of recreation., though it really is pointing towards a full on legalization, even as soon as this year.  They want the tax money to help pay for the 1.9 tril aid package.

this is not a fact i have read, just a gut feeling 

I have another 5g in buying power available as cash.  Outside of a life changing moon shot i plan to hold everything,  selling enough to just cover the seed if the opportunity arises.

I plan to have as many as 100 positions by end of year, assuming i can find enough cannabis companies that look solid enough to invest in.

I do realize this is not how it has typically been done but we will most likely never have an opportunity to invest in something like this.

The point of all the positions is to have a hand in as many cookie jars as possible to increase the odds of a moon shot and trying to get as much of intial boom as i can

depending on the DD im in for between 50-200 bucks on most of these.

i actually hope it take awhile so i can buy some dips and increase my positions before everything goes down.

How stupid is my plan? 

Any and all advice would be appreciated.",Praughfet,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/ldpt05/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gm8r6e1/,0.031,0.87,0.099,0.9905

Also, I‚Äôm always looking at the extended charts (5 years) because some of these pennys were at $5.00 at one point. If that‚Äôs the case, I‚Äôm most definitely looking at them as quick turns because something catastrophic happened fundamentally at some point, or they‚Äôve completely changed their business model. If a stock had always been a penny and is steadily increasing I‚Äôm still in and out but it‚Äôs a candidate for rebuy in my estimation.

430,NEO," Also in deep. 100k shares here! Got in as low as 0.40 but average is closer to $1. Also never selling!!

Saw some folks wondering how to find these early. First, it‚Äôs still incredibly early for MindMed! Don‚Äôt be fooled by the stock price being dollars and not cents: it‚Äôs still in 5 bagger potential this year alone. 

Second, look for large trends. Compass Pathways‚Äôs meteoric rise got me looking into others like it in the psychedelic space. MindMed is by far their biggest and most well organized competitor. I perused their website when they were 0.40 and it was obvious they were guided by the right leadership, funded by big names, and diversifying their portfolio. If you research like a lot of the folks on the sub you‚Äôll find NUMI, EHVVF, and a myriad of others, too. Get in now!

And if you don‚Äôt know which ones to get in, there‚Äôs an ETF called PSYK on the NEO that currently has 17 psychedelic companies in it.

433,DD," If you‚Äôre questioning the validity of a very small stock cross reference a few forums, Reddit and Twitter are my two, and see what‚Äôs been discussed. Sometimes there is a lot of legit DD people have done, and other times you can catch the pump and dumps prior to investing in them. By checking multiple forums you‚Äôll be able to confirm a lot of DD quickly, and then confirm the trends of the stock itself.

434,HUGE," So, if you go to OTCmarkets.com, click in the upper left hand corner on ‚Äòstock screener‚Äô you can parse these out according to market and sort by volume or price.  Sometimes the rise is organic, but usually at these levels, it is either market manipulation or insider info. A small caveat is that sometimes filings might quietly happen on a stock and savvy investors will see these court or sec filings and buy accordingly.  Very rarely is it a shot in the dark. But the good news is, with that scanner you can spot these trends as they appear. Case in point, I saw $DKAM yesterday and bought 1m shares for $500 as a dart throw.

ALSO, when you see a stock mentioned by pumpers, check the volume and price for the previous couple days. Usually, you will notice that there is a HUGE spike in volume, even into the hundreds of millions (or even billions) and the price has risen from .000x to somewhere much higher.

444,CTRM," Where are you getting this random information and numbers from. Please quote your references or links anytime you say something because if not it just look like fancy words that mean bullshit. Either way since you mentioned their PE, well first off PE is simply price of share/earnings-per-share; that‚Äôs literally what it is. So using trailing PE instead of forwards PE CTRM current price per share is $0.75 and earnings-per-share last year is at $0.31. So simply 0.75/0.31 = 2.41 PE ratio. For a stock price of $3 assuming same EPS 3/0.31 = 9.7 PE ratio that all it means. Where are you even getting 250 PE or even 35 P/S. Even if you‚Äôre calculating PE using market cap/net earning your numbers are still wrong. And to add on, looking at the P/E of a stock tells you very little about it if it‚Äôs not compared to the company‚Äôs historical P/E or the competitor‚Äôs P/E from the same industry. You can‚Äôt conclude whether a stock with a low P/E is a bargain, or a high P/E is expensive without performing any comparisons, all this is futile/useless if you‚Äôre not even comparing it with other companies in the same industry, which you have not done. Also u probably didn‚Äôt know CTRM currently has 37mill cash in hand‚ùóÔ∏èand if you look at their revenues it was well increasing before COVID took at hit. And even rn their gross sales seem to be going up. You can find all these numbers I listed on marketwatch.com - CTRM.

According to Globe & mail it lists a PE of 5.75 and an EPS of $0.12. According to the app Bezinga CTRM has a 12.03 PE. As you can see all these different apps shows different values, but overall they seem to have an accurate approximate average compared to your 250 PE. At this point it‚Äôs gonna be my sources/links vs yours, and I don‚Äôt know about you but out of the 3 that I mentioned, MarketWatch is considered the most reputable. Even then, you seem to not understand we are talking about a penny stock of course most of its reading on different sources aren‚Äôt gonna be as accurate, but I still bet on market watch being a better source.

In looking at the charts on a longer term, right around $4 (the high it just hit and is coming off of) looks like a long term resistance that it just tested.

487,DD," Let's face it. Everyone on here talking about any stock probably already has positions in that stock and is trying to get more people to jump on the train and increase the hype for quicker profits. I don't think anyone can deny that. 

To me it doesn't matter, as long as that person can provide reasoning for pumping. I hate the posts that go ""\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ stock is about to moon! Jump on the train while you can!"" and has no other DD. In the case of SNPW I actually saw some potential in what they're doing. The DD's at least had links and when I looked further, I found an active twitter and an actual website with new projects on the way. Add that to the fact that green energy companies right now are jumping off the charts regardless of earnings and you might have yourself a winner here. In the past there have definitely been low karma accounts that spammed a ticker that actually ended up blowing the fuck up. It's all up to you and your judgement man.

If CBBT makes up 10% of the company they get 10% of the shares in the new company at a 1:1 ratio (or another set by the deal). sponsors get their share for money invested and PKG will get the rest.

I mean risks beyond just penny stocks like I'll put all my money into this 0.0001 all I need is for it to move 10x! 

Always start small when learning. I am exploring options so I bought a few. My first was SENS long call. Then AMC 06Feb put(made $17 on $34). Then I lost $100 buying 7 NOK calls trying to play the earnings. Last I finished attempting to buy a stock with a put that closes next week. If I get assigned I own it otherwise I get paid $150 for $500 on hold for 7 trading days. All are small and I was prepared to lose my money I played with.

I stated penny stocks on fidelity with free trades so I traded $100-300 shares at a time. One of my first large purchases was ALPP 2,000 shares at 0.43. I used watch those smaller investments and when they started moving I sometimes added more into it.

If I want to enter this trade, I will sell cash secured with a long expiration date against good growth tech stock, for example, SKLZ, and use that premium to buy OCGN. Even if OCGN goes to 0, I still can recover from SKLZ's contract.

From what I have read on investopedia is that these warrants are valued similar to stock options complexity. Also, exercising warrants is dilutive, so 500 million shares will have to be created by HUMBL to fufill this obligation. An easy way to see if FORW is undervalued based on the 500 million warrants is to calculate the approximate value of them and compare them to FORW market cap. George sharp regularly tweets the value of each warrant as TSNP has risen.

$1000 or $100 or $10 capital at the start of the challenge 

Put it all in a single trade in the morning. Choose a safe is trade that has actual potential and not P+D or random stuff you didn't research on

If its in profit before market closes, take profits and do the same thing the next day.

Example 

$100 in ABC

At market close it is at $102

Close trade

Tomorrow

$102 in XYZ

Its at $110 at close

Following day 

$112 in LMN 

At close it is a $106

Leave it alone until it is in profit 

Do this until you see huge gains 

You could even start with $2000/$200 etc and open/close 2 trades a day

702,EV," OTC: ILUS, ILUS International Completes Acquisition of The Vehicle Converters LLC (TVC), Increasing ILUS Group Manufacturing Capability in Preparation for the ILUS EV & FireBug Technology Roll Out
Mentioned:	ILUS
via NewMediaWire -- ILUS International (OTC: ILUS): The Vehicle Converters LLC, known as TVC, is a Dubai-based $3mil dollar annual revenue business (Pre Covid) operating as a specialist manufacturer and converter of service vehicles, primarily Medical, Military, Police, Fire & Rescue response vehicles, usually small rapid response type vehicles. TVC has converted more than 8,000 of the most advanced vehicles for some of the biggest brands in the world and is listed on almost every major Preferred Supplier List in the Middle East and North African Market. Many of the leading governments globally have been researching the possibility of having joint first responders in a single vehicle, meaning 1 small vehicle arrives with multi trained multi-skilled responders instead of sending a Fire Truck, Ambulance and Police vehicle to a small incident, wasting taxpayers money. The TVC medical & police vehicle experience combined with Firebug's patented fire technology would make a world-leading solution that would be very difficult for any competitor to compete with.

The management team at TVC is highly experienced and operates a good corporate governance system that fits strongly with the ILUS model. ILUS management believes that the strategic value of the acquisition will provide a return on this investment in a very short time. The FireBug & TVC factories will merge into one single facility during the second quarter of 2021, allowing consolidation, scale, substantial cost savings and skill enhancement. The acquisition was paid for in cash and restricted shares.

The revenue consolidation into the ILUS group is a building block and the strategic value is placed on the manufacturing capacity, skill sets and established routes to market. While FireBug already supplies to many top brands in the Middle East, the Acquisition of TVC will speed up the access to a huge customer base of almost every top brand in the Oil & Gas, Military, Civil Defense & Medical Sector in the Middle East and North Africa Market. TVC's experience in the specialist vehicle market will allow the FireBug Group to expand their offering to customers in the rest of the world where TVC has not been active and FireBug is active in more than 20 countries. This gateway should bring exponential growth for both company's core products and open the door to develop some new game changing products. In addition to the core products, TVC has developed a range of products that are non-core to the ILUS group, the margins are very attractive and utilize the same manufacturing process and the products have an outstanding customer base and strong cashflow, and would create another platform for EV sales later, so ILUS will continue to develop this cautiously and structure it in a way that could allow possible divestment in future and does not distract from the core focus of the group.

While TVC has strong manufacturing skills and IP, FireBug brings new more advanced, environmentally friendly, more cost-effective & longer lasting, lower maintenance & lighter-weight technologies. FireBug has its own Co-Polymer plastic vehicle body manufacturing technology and this will be introduced into the TVC products, replacing the old fashioned conventional GRP and Metal vehicle bodies with almost indestructible co-polymer bodies.

Importantly TVC has the assembly capability to scale up the production of the ILUS ERaptor for the region. TVC has been successful over the years, providing vehicle conversions under partnerships with OEM vehicle manufacturers for the Middle East Market and ILUS will look to develop this further.

Ultimately the TVC customer base in the region, who are mostly Blue Chip, Government departments and various agencies, are under immense pressure to move to EV. This opens the door for the ILUS EV sales. ILUS is heavily focused on the development of an expanded EV offering in the future. The majority of the sectors which ILUS Group target have not been modernized for decades so the demand for modernization way supersedes the supply.

The Middle East and North Africa Market (MENA) has a population of 580mil people and is undergoing extensive re-focus and huge investment moving away from oil dependency, creating the opportunity for change. The market is largely under-serviced with the products that TVC supply and naturally being a desert, water saving is vital, which supports the FireBug water saving technology. One example is Saudi Arabia, who is creating an entire new Region called NEOM, which is a 2 Trillion Saudi Riyals (+$500 Billion) development, the demand for ILUS & TVC",Guled952,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/ldimbz/ilus_who_is_in_this_gem/gm613ri/,0.038,0.856,0.106,0.9931
