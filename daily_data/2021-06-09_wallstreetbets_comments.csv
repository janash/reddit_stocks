29,DD," Actually a problem for the long-term suitability of the sub. So far the few stocks pushed recently look a LOT like a pump and dump. WSB had serious issues in Jan about getting shut down (remember the discord fiasco and WSB going down for a bit?). I'm a new ape, but through all the shit flinging I've learned so much in such a short time thanks to so many dedicated apes. Despite that, the rhetoric now is eerily like after Jan where if enough stocks make it to the front page and look like pump and dumps the power that be will come down on us. That really almost happened once. As for the good old days, communities evolve and adapt to new members (there should be a turnover) to stay alive. Here I feel it's attracted a unique scattering of personalities and with that comes conflict. Now mix in some FUD and that's where we are now.

As far as I can tell the only time it hasn't worked is GME because they sold to soon. 

It's big benefit is that I don't think there's been one good non-Citadel ticker. If they don't have shares, and it's on wsb, it's not pumping. In that sense it's probably saved me more money than it's made me when I think about fomo'ing

Also hedgefunds have a lot of capital to send out there. Not everyone can YOLO into CLOV back on May 5 when we learned about this and watch their money bleed out until the right amount of bossbabes and hedgefunds get the pump ready... but if you can throw a few bucks into it, it's not bad

111,PM," Ryan Cohen Gives Shoutout to Reddit Crowd at Annual Meeting (1)
Wednesday, June 9, 2021 05:41 PM 
By Olga Kharif

Cohen was elected the retailer‚Äôs chairman at the meeting
Cohen said he doesn‚Äôt plan to telegraph his strategy to rivals
(Bloomberg) --Ryan Cohen, the GameStop Corp. activist investor who became its chairman on Wednesday, said he isn‚Äôt going to unveil a new strategy yet. But he gave some hints during a talk at the retailer‚Äôs annual meeting.
‚ÄúWe are trying to do something that nobody in the retail space has ever done,‚Äù Cohen said at the gathering, held in GameStop‚Äôs hometown of Grapevine, Texas. ‚ÄúBut we believe we‚Äôre putting the right pieces in place and we have clear goals: delighting customers and driving shareholder value for the long term.‚Äù

Cohen is trying to turn the brick-and-mortar retailer into an e-commerce competitor to Amazon.com Inc., in part by increasing the number of products and services it offers. He‚Äôs already shaken up the company‚Äôs management team, and is working to improve customer service and delivery. GameStop, slated to release its quarterly results later on Wednesday, is currently seeking a new chief executive officer.

The company is still struggling, but it has won the faith of the Reddit crowd, which has helped propel the stock more than 1,500% in 2021. GameStop has been one of this year‚Äôs top meme stocks, which trade off of social-media buzz rather than business fundamentals. The shares gained as much as 6.7% to $320 on Wednesday.

While some investors had hoped Cohen would lay out a detailed plan for turning GameStop around, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not going to happen,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt find us talking a big game, making a bunch of lofty promises or telegraphing our strategy to the competition.‚Äù

His previous company, pet supplier Chewy, had the same philosophy, he said.

Cohen announced a stake in GameStop last year and began pushing for changes at the video-game retailer. He now owns 13% of the company and has three seats on its board. On Wednesday, Cohen also made a shoutout to the Reddit fans behind GameStop‚Äôs rally.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre fortunate to have such a special group of investors holding the company‚Äôs shares,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou guys inspire us to think bigger, fight harder and work longer each day.‚Äù",quantkim,105,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvs3c6/gme_q1_earnings_megathread/h169h4l/,0.021,0.854,0.125,0.9923

Simply open a new account and initiate a transfer. If you call Fidelity a super nice person will actually answer the phone and walk you through it, if you have questions about anything. Their phone support is amazing, and will continue to be for years to come. 

It will take a few business days to settle, and there is a small fee. Ask RH what the fee will be, that's on their end.

546,CLF," Just a teenie-tiny not exactly a warning about CLF. (I've been long on CLF since March 2020.)

Their manufacturing process works best when massive orders are rolling in and foreign competition is low.

If you take a big position in CLF -- it is my biggest -- you need to follow the news on anything that might roll back the steel tariffs from the Trump era against China.

So far so good on Biden not rolling them back. My guess is that Biden's ties to labor make him Trumpier than Dems like to admit, especially on this front.

However . . . you still want to keep an eye on how much foreign steel might make it into the U.S.

If the tariffs stay rock-solid, I have CLF reaching $125.

If not, then a lot depends on how well their plans to buy back their debt go. So far so good on that front, too. They'll likely be in a better position to ride out the next dip if they keep reigning in their debt during this boom time. So they shouldn't crash back to $3.

642,GME," lol this is the comedy I come to WSB for.  There have been people playing this before GME was a thing.  Take off your tinfoil hat once in a while.  Any minor amount of research on your part - or ""scrutiny"" - as you say will show this is a fundamentally undervalued company.


Further ""scrutiny"" will show steel prices have been through the roof and this company hasn't moved much even thought they directly benefit from this.  I can go on much more, but you aren't worth my time.


Go back to diamond handing your GME.

The 100 shares of CRSP I really don‚Äôt want to touch.

Also, like an idiot, while I was still living with my parents back home in Ohio, I was still on my lease back in NC and gambled $2500 (about 6 months worth of rent) in the market as well and lost about $1900 leaving me with just south of 2 months worth of rent. 

I‚Äôve learned my lessons for sure, and I‚Äôm happy that I put money into CLOV and WISH yesterday, and I‚Äôm optimistic about AMC, but my goal is

The 100 shares of CRSP I really don‚Äôt want to touch. I originally had 50 shares of MSFT at around $245 at its peak (then), sold it all for GME, diamond handed it, and then sold it for a slight loss at $90/share (bought in around $94/share). Used that money to buy CRSP because I felt like an idiot with my GME purchase, thinking it wouldn‚Äôt ever spike again. Also, like an idiot, while I was still living with my parents back home in Ohio, I was still on my lease back in NC and gambled $2500 (about 6 months worth of rent) in the market as well and lost about $1900 leaving me with just south of 2 months worth of rent. 

I‚Äôve learned my lessons for sure, and I‚Äôm happy that I put money into CLOV and WISH yesterday, and I‚Äôm optimistic about AMC, but my goal is 

100 shares of BEAM, 
100 shares of FATE,

25 shares of NVDA, 
25 shares of TSLA, 
50 shares of AMD, 
50 shares of AAPL, 
50 shares of MSFT, and 
50 shares of AI. 

That said, I really want to get into purchasing calls, I just don‚Äôt really know how to. I use TD Ameritrade and I just want to make sure I‚Äôm doing it right and be super careful. I definitely have opinions about what prices certain stocks will be at by some time point I think, I just don‚Äôt know how to trade calls on those.

There is this moment when you finally do a couple SMALL trades for real, they work out like you expected them to, and you think ""maybe I CAN do this.""

Now I wish I had a little more of that fear left to stop me from gambling on so much dumb shit like 0-day SPX Iron Condors.

EDIT: I've been slowly working through a copy of Get Rich with Options by Lee Lowell that a friend gave me a few years ago. I should have read it a lot earlier because I already picked up a lot of the advice from other sources, but it does seem to be a pretty solid primer on options for beginners from what I can tell so far. Probably the most useful aspect is that Lowell used to work the exchange as a market maker so you get to see this stuff from the perspective of the other side.",ToastFaceKillahhh,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvonrs/500k_gain_today_with_wish_clne_and_vldr_leading/h16gse3/,0.098,0.769,0.133,0.8367

1297,BB," I'm just a smooth brained ape but here is my understanding from reading this - it sounds like the operating costs might make BB take a hit for a little while in revenue. Then once their connected vehicle app system starts getting popular they should make plenty of money, that is if Amazon doesn't take too large a chunk of the profits. The news is nice, will give BB a boost in stock price for a bit then I'm sure it'll stagnate.

My fear is too many people are buying into too many stocks causing small blips where if, like in the beginning with GME, everyone fixated on 2 stock, or maybe 2, all the funding would cause another spike like we saw. People say ""it costs too much now""... well, im sure plenty of people said the same for GME at 50... I know I did. Then I saw the spike and realized 50 a share would have me banking right now. You drop in $50 x1000 and it goes to 100.. is that much different than the guy who dropped 10 and now has 20? Actually, the guy dropping 50 will profit way more for smaller increases. So... its never too late unless you're an idiot using the light bill money on trades.... about like the fucktards in line at the gas station buying a 22 oz beer buying 200 in lottery tickets, wearing rags and smelling like shitty cat litter...saying ""this is the ticket"" . If you cant lose the money and be okay, dont use it... pay your bills, whats left your willing to roll, roll it. Its a new pair of shitty shoes or 50 on a share that could easily make you 3-4x that.. and then you have a new pair of shoes and more money to roll.. and repeat.

1916,OR," Bro.. drop the fkn mic. You leveled it. I wish this post could get out on fb land (but fuck mark Zuckerberg....prick) and theyd actually get whats taking place. My fear is too many people are buying into too many stocks causing small blips where if, like in the beginning with GME, everyone fixated on 2 stock, or maybe 2, all the funding would cause another spike like we saw. People say ""it costs too much now""... well, im sure plenty of people said the same for GME at 50... I know I did. Then I saw the spike and realized 50 a share would have me banking right now. You drop in $50 x1000 and it goes to 100.. is that much different than the guy who dropped 10 and now has 20? Actually, the guy dropping 50 will profit way more for smaller increases. So... its never too late unless you're an idiot using the light bill money on trades.... about like the fucktards in line at the gas station buying a 22 oz beer buying 200 in lottery tickets, wearing rags and smelling like shitty cat litter...saying ""this is the ticket"" . If you cant lose the money and be okay, dont use it... pay your bills, whats left your willing to roll, roll it. Its a new pair of shitty shoes or 50 on a share that could easily make you 3-4x that.. and then you have a new pair of shoes and more money to roll.. and repeat.

2078,BB," One call is a contract to buy 100 shares for a specific price at a specific date. Calls are used when you predict a stock will increase in price, Puts are used when you predict it will fall

For example, say I bought 10 calls of BB for $12 for 6/18. That means that on 6/18, I reserve the right to buy 1000 shares of BB for $12 each. The catch is that you're charged a premium per share to reserve this contract. So if the premium costs $1 for this call, I'd have to pay $1000 in premium to hold this contract.

Then you have 3 options. 1) on 6/18 you can execute the call and purchase 1000 shares of BB for $12 each, having already paid your premium. 2) You can sell the contract to someone else, but that's only going to happen if the stock goes up. 3) Let the call expire, meaning that you don't actually buy 1000 shares for $12 each (handy if the stock price falls), but you still lose the premium you already paid. 

Definitely a lot more risky than just buying and selling stocks, but with the potential for a lot more profit",hjhoulton,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvo3ym/bb_expect_large_movements_within_1_month_part_7/h16eivl/,0.043,0.867,0.091,0.836

2113,LNG," I have a different view on the company than many here.  Although LNG and CNG seemed poised to take over transportation as little as 5 years ago, the movement has stalled thanks to the flat YOY change in diesel prices.  when accounting for inflation, it's not a big enough hit to transposition fleets to risk the massive conversion to CNG.

the risks are that the companies that explored CNG found that the engines ran hotter and had worse longevity at a higher cost (which even my ape brain thinks it's probably a bad thing)
Some companies (like one that I worked for) tried to build their own CNG infrastructure.  It costs millions and is way harder and more expensive to maintain than a similar diesel (or even electric) infrastructure.  
 
Buy a company that provides electric infrastructure to heavy duty fleets, that's gonna be the money maker in the next 5 years.  Local and short haul fleets are going to convert fast as soon as American heavy duty OEMs start mass production.",Deviousterran,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvg0fv/you_all_saved_my_ass_with_clov_wish_and_clne_made/h146cse/,0.073,0.898,0.029,-0.7717

The option gamblers and the long share holders are friends not enemies!!

We fight for the same cause, one cannot exist without the other

If the options market was stable mms and shorts would have no problem managing their exposure and the shorts wouldn't be shorting their pants about an impending gamma squeeze

Try not to get too caught up on SI numbers. There can still be positive short interest with net market long exposure.

Even 10% SI is enough to light shit up in the middle of a gamma squeeze when the spot price is unstable and crushing through limit sell walls",Maleficent_Platypus6,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvw92o/wish_short_interest_of_4867_why_do_people_say_it/h16vpnu/,0.105,0.741,0.154,0.7421

Yesterday's volume ([7 million in 1 minute + low volatility](https://imgur.com/IZ3GC4P)) 7 million volume and that low volatility? Impossible for 60 million float. On top of that, previous SI reported was around 8 to 12 percent. 8 to 12 percent of true float (assuming Bloomberg is wrong would be 275 mil) is around the 48 percent of 66 mil reported. On top of that, there's absolutely no evidence of any float shrinkage. Float shrinkage can be caused by a few reasons, but a 275 mil to 66 mil without any SEC or media evidence seems impossible. I know people aren't going to be happy to hear this, but WISH wasn't the short squeeze we thought it was.

2381,WKHS," On a technical note. WKHS is pushing a massively strong resistance level at $16. If it can turn this to a support level, it will have a strong foundation for climbing further. But it needs to close in the green above the $16 on the daily. It should close today above $16 but it comes with a lot of selling volume. It needs a solid green day full of buy volume to turn that resistance into support. If volume confirms the flip - we should be able to rocket until at least $24 which is a 50% upside to the $16 :)  


After that we should have a $28-$30 level resistance.

It's super early for a long play given fundamentals (a little over $500k of rev last quarter), but there are several potential catalysts. The first is the short interest + retail investors holding. I wouldn't say it will squeeze, but there's upside for sure.

The more important catalysts are 2 things. 1) reversal or increase of the USPS contract to add more EVs to the fleet. That could be imminent and I believe is one of the reasons for this past week's runup. 2) their IP in last mile EV + drone is the future.

2604,WKHS," It‚Äôs a solid question, my guess is because it was overvalued in February, and the USPS decision made for an easy short opportunity. 

Also, revenue is a real concern. $520K sales with a $120M net loss. Clearly they‚Äôre in the capital investment stage of their growth, so there‚Äôs a lot of uncertainty with how quickly WKHS can grow sales, let alone turn a profit.

2605,GME," Unlike all the others, this one actually is. High short interest. Low number of shares compared to larger companies.   

The reason they are shorted is because they ""lost"" the bid to supply the USPS. In reality the head of USPS is a Trump guy who you might remember is famous for dismantling voting machines to fuck with the mail in vote thought to favor Biden. He also doesn't believe in climate change and bought a shit ton of the stock of the gas powered vehicle company he awarded it to the night before he announced. Intentally flouting Biden's mandate for electric fleets. This is now under investigation and it is possible the bid will be overturned.

I have a high confidence rate in this stock, both short and long term (might actually add to my Roth IRA), but I don't want to be the reason anybody loses. 

My rule of thumb is get out early. When the sentiment dies the stock falls quicker than it rose. It's paramount to secure profits as soon as you can sell 25%-50% of your investment and entirely cover your initial cost. Today I sold about 40% of my CLOV investment for roughly $2.5k (initial investment of $200), I know CLOV is still going to rocket but gotta cover my own ass.

2970,FOR," Great point. Let‚Äôs not forget that even during a crash, a well managed Mortgage Wholesale lender will dominate. Market crashes are essentially when values of homes fall, leading to: more qualified buyers. Even if the buyers are the higher wage earning crowd, they will not walk away from a good deal.

3092,CLOV," New to options as well. (This week)

From what I read... it's not just price of the stock, but really the volatility up and down as well. 

If WSB gets a hold of this stock, like they did GME AMC CLOV call option prices go through the roof. (Even of they are not in the money) 

I sold a couple of these same options you mentioned. I purchased yesterday for some pretty good profit today. (Low volume yesterday, high volume stock up 10% today... but options were never in the money) 

It is a true gamble esp with short term calls in my opinion. Think of a short term call option as a pull of the slot machine. You could win big, chances are you just dumped 20 bucks in and got nothing out.... however.... if the stock hits and goes waaay up! OMG huge wins.

I have been looking for ""cheap"" contracts... like .05 to .50 cents per. (They dont have to be in the money, just close to strike price with a lot of volatility from what I have seen) 

BTW.... I notice that there is always a ""sweet spot"" on options pricing... no idea why... but options that expire a week later or earlier at the same strike price is like double the cost. I am dumb so probably missing something completely obvious. 

By going cheap I dont loose everything, and have some good upside! 

These calls sold for 5 cents yesterday and I seen them at over a dollar today. 

Long term calls are totally different in my opinion... I look at those as purchase in something you likely believe in, and dont have dough to purchase shares right now. 


TLDR: not huge balls ape, conservative investor. I purchase cheap calls in hope's they hit big. I have no idea what I am doing. 

Not advice. I am likely drunk and eating crayons in my own tears of lost dough as you read this.

3109,GME," Float volume data is self reported, and doesn't account for synthetic shares that are caused by naked short selling, which is a practice that's extremely common and definitely illegal. It's even made mainstream news lately. What it means is that if a company has a known amount of shares out that are reported in data generated by FINRA, MarketWatch, etc, their float interest isn't genuine. There are millions of shares out there that aren't accounted for. It's the whole source of doubt in the original GME ""Shorts have already covered narrative"" while every day there are hundreds of thousands of shares borrowed and sold to add to sale volume to drive down price.

3175,CLF," I am quite familiar with those guys as well. The mills being older is a good reason why they are not the steel company with the highest stock, but it doesn't matter in the end. Steel is going crazy. 2008 levels of crazy. Every company and supplier that needs steel is outbidding one another to make sure they get said orders. 

In your comment, you mentioned that you're short. I am unsure if you mean taking on a short position, short on the angle at play here, or short in height. If you have a short position on CLF, then I hope it's far out. Like a year out. Steel stocks are not buckling down anytime soon, as the demand just keeps on revving up.

It has a decent short float, but I‚Äôm not in it for the short term. I think it‚Äôs an extremely promising company that already has had some great success, so even in the event of a short squeeze, I would still keep shares afterwards.

3286,CLNE," There are 32,000 $13 6/18 calls. They cost around .88 or $88 each right now. If CLNE reaches 13.88, then the contract holders can execute the contract and force whoever sold it to them to sell their shares to them at $13 each. 

If each contract is executed then it would be 3.2 million shares that would be bought at $13 which would raise the price of the stock even higher. Now most likely not all contracts will be executed so you have to understand that too

With a lot of contracts being executed, raising the price even higher, then other contracts will be itm letting those contracts be executed too and the gamma squeeze continues until there‚Äôs not enough juice

3357,AMC," AMC and GME are very unique, in that we essentially (no literally) saved them from bankruptcy. They are headed by CEO's sympathetic to our cause and incontestably in our pockets (which they should be, we own the companies now). But most other companies will exploit us (and this movement) to their advantage through share sales and quiet bonuses, some that we won't know about for months. Then there's the various share structure games and BOD arrangements to rob us more. They do not care about you or I. And we have no ability to reign in this centralized power of theirs. So I believe we're stuck with a handful of opportunities. It's also why I think we can push these companies to astronomical valuations.

I am waiting to see breakout from this downward channel as well. I also like to use Fib Retrancement/Extension. 61.8% retrcement (**$9**) mark is your support line at the moment. It is in a pressure cooker at the moment with this support at the bottom and down trend line at the top, something got to give. It is doing well after hours so tomorrow might be the day when it pops. If it does, it will probably go above $11 and retest 50% line in the opening. If it holds above, I'll probably buy some calls specially if volume is high again. 

But yeah, feels like tomorrow might actually be the breakout day.

4004,RH," What broker? Remember the risk with options:

* They wildly fluctuate in value (so as much as it goes up, it goes down)
* BUT the good thing is, if you buy a call, you can only lose as much as you invested
* Option calls have an expiry date, the closer it gets to that date, more value it loses, until it's zero 

Personally I take a share + option strategy. Shares are safer, if you're in a good company, eventually they will be valuable. Options are about timing. Safest options are 1-3 years, but they cost more and therefore you don't make as much as your risk is lower.

4014,RKT," Good advice but don‚Äôt jump in to options based on comment replies alone.  Read and watch a bunch and dip your toes in very lightly on SPY. If you ignore that noise, then at least buy RKT options out at least a year.

4020,RKT," It's important to look at the trends and how it's trending. It's breaking out of the sideways trading and is receiving lots of analyst upgrades to BUY.   
You have to remember that RKT has a large number of investors that would like to pin the price down for a variety of reasons. I suspect they are distressed in other short positions and so RKT should now go back to it's real value.",Original-Baki,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvjrwa/the_og_meme_stock_rkt_is_about_rocket_into_tendie/h13ozah/,0.066,0.829,0.105,0.25
