0,GME," What I've done is started with an amount that I was comfortable gambling. I got a bit above that and took out the amount that put me back down to my original number and then I've skimmed off a little here and there, eventually setting in a slightly higher base. I followed here for a while, wsb up through GME, and haven't kept up much with either in a little while. 

I would say I've had one decent win and a lot of smaller ones that would have been huge (6x-11x) if I had held on. I usually take profit at 5-10% if I can. I guess my couple of lucky plays have mostly offset my losing plays. My 1yr chart is +230% (for now). We're talking like, four figures, because I'm not comfortable losing much on super risky stuff apparently.",Jakeeggs,4,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/n8znjt/who_else_is_back_to_where_heshe_started_trading_1/gxlvgei/,0.046,0.74,0.214,0.9732

6,GE," Though not penny stocks, I like GE, Apple, Goldman Sachs, PNC Financial, and Total for long term. Speculation is not my best play lately. Took a small loss on Coupang. Much more on InvestHawks thread if you‚Äôre interested.

10,CTXR, Are you worried about the buy the hype sell the news trend that has been occurring with a majority of pennies? CTXR has been hyped up a lot for months because of MinoLok but with the conference on it coming Thursday May 13th I‚Äôm afraid of the inevitable crash that almost everything has done at major catalysts. I was holding 200 shares but got out on the last run because I don‚Äôt want to bag hold ctxr anymore. So I‚Äôm genuinely interested on peoples thoughts. I‚Äôm not asking for an answer just speculation.,youngmuss666,8,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/n8o9bt/dd_ctxr_is_most_likely_going_to_be_included_in/gxjq6i2/,0.053,0.863,0.084,0.467
11,PLX," It's impossible to tell beforehand, I sold PLX before the news and their stock tanked 40% when they werent approved, I held PTE through their news because i didnt feel it was priced in and made 23% today. It's been a really rough market for swings lately but it's still possible for catalysts to rocket a stock if it turns out their mino-lok has very good news on thursday. If there's nothing big on Thursday I feel that we will plunge as the main reason it tanked last week was because everyone thought the approval news would be last week and then they announced that news wouldnt happen until this week. Just remember were a bunch of people on reddit, not financial advisors, the market is extremely unpredictable at the moment so I am being cautious, be safe but hopefully we can all moon on this one",barksonic,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/n8o9bt/dd_ctxr_is_most_likely_going_to_be_included_in/gxnoooa/,0.024,0.872,0.104,0.9346
