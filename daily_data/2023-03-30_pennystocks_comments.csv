7,MA," Hey, I am also in this :)

But I don't give a shit about a companies financials, to be honest, I don't even know what they do besides Biotech.

[See the chart here with my entries](https://www.tradingview.com/x/znstSvdH/)

I got in at first when they had an [Episodic Pivot](https://qullamaggie.com/how-to-master-a-setup-episodic-pivots/) after earnings, sold half of that position at around ~$4 and the rest at breakeven on Mar 10. But that day the market totally tanked and all the other stocks I was watching broke below the 10d MA line. Not this one though, it showed real relative strength, so I got back in after the bounce.

Sold half of that position as well after a few days and will let the rest ride until it breaks down below the 10d and closes there. There was also another [Breakout-Setup](https://qullamaggie.com/my-3-timeless-setups-that-have-made-me-tens-of-millions/) on monday where I could have added more to the position, but it wasn't really clean.

I disagree with your statement ""you only have to be right once"", because you are not going to stop trading. You always want to have a longterm statistic of your performance. If you do 100 trades like this and 99 of them fail, you better make sure you only lose as much money as the one trade makes up for. If you take this 80k win, but lose 1k for each other trade for example, you are not profitable..

Best of luck to you :)",El_Grappadura,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/1266dhf/you_only_have_to_be_right_once_that_is_all/je8xj0i/,0.085,0.74,0.176,0.9753

It had a massive sell-off and it’s currently sitting at around 0.50 cents a share which would be equivalent to 0.125 cents pre split per share.
