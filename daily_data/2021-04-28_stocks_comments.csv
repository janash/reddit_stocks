28,GME," 100% yes it will be/is now overused. GME in January was a very unique case in that it was a) an extremely heavily shorted stock, and b) there was a genuine contrarian recovery play going on there. Personally I don’t think it justified its current valuation - but remember back in January GME was only valued at $1bn, so even a modest improvement in its future prospects could have massively improved its valuation.

If both those factors hadn’t been present ie extreme shorting and a Cohen-led recovery play, we wouldn’t have seen a squeeze like we did. Equally Volkswagen in 2008 was very unique - first of all the German government owned a big chunk of the stock meaning it wasn’t available to trade, and secondly Porsche had built up a huge hidden long position which the market wasn’t aware of (they were aiming to takeover Volkswagen using huge amounts of leverage, although ironically VW ended up buying them).

I’m not saying you shouldn’t be contrarian or think the market/hedge funds aren’t ever wrong - they often are, and there is plenty of money to be made by contrarian plays/buying into undervalued companies.
But usually if a company is heavily shorted there is a reason for it (ie it’s a cr*ppy company - these hedge funds are generally pretty smart guys) - and secondly even with significant short interest there is rarely ever the catalyst for a short squeeze.

So yes in summary I think it will be heavily overused going forward without much merit (both on a certain sub Reddit and also CNBC)",introspective79,1,/r/stocks/comments/n0jre7/do_you_think_the_term_short_squeeze_will_be/gw71wzl/,0.025,0.79,0.185,0.9923

37,GME," We started seeing this immediately after the WSB short-squeeze hype surrounding GME in mid January. Because of the level of activity GME caused and because it was a traditional short squeeze, we see people who are actively trying to manipulate the market to their benefit by calling everything with over a 5% short float a potential short squeeze candidate. It's all just a new take on manipulating markets but now we're seeing it with huge companies, something very unusual.

I first started trading penny stocks when I was a teenager on some random app that's now almost certainly defunct. What I'm seeing now is exactly what I was seeing then. You go on to a message board (in this case reddit) and there's one person who claims to know a stock will move quickly up. They pump the stock on all the boards and get enough sheeple to dump a few bucks in which of course artificially inflates that price and then a few people make money hand over fist while everyone else is left bag-holding.

The only difference here is that these are large cap stocks, not some random penny stock with no volume. We're seeing it with huge corporations like Rocket Mortgage and even more so with all the drug/pharma companies back in early February. You take any highly speculative stock and look at their January or February graphs and you'll see the power of this 'short-squeeze' tactic. There are so many more people able to invest today that are simply following WSB or call-outs on Twitter and investing. 

The good news is, because these are large cap stocks generally, there's no real fear of losing everything... like I did when I was just a teenager with a few bucks to trade. If these folks just let their investments sit for a few months they'll almost certainly gain back all their losses.",LaughAdventureGame,1,/r/stocks/comments/n0jre7/do_you_think_the_term_short_squeeze_will_be/gw7o3f3/,0.066,0.828,0.106,0.9143

The reality is that hedge funds will feast on each other if they out themselves into vulnerable positions. Retail coordinated their buying on gamestop, yes, but they had significant tailwinds with other whale entities taking the same position.

70,GME," I’m heavily into GME and yes it does get pretty “cultish” in these subs. I think there’s two reasons it’s garnered a cult like following, for myself included. 
1. Blatant fuckery. I personally bought in after seeing RH shut down their buy button. You can argue why they did this all day, but no matter if it was malicious or not, retail investors got screwed here. Also, the borrow rate for shorts is staying around 1% which does not make sense considering there are not many shorts available and the SI is still really high (around 20% last time I checked). 
2. It is becoming a mix between growth and value investing. GME is positioned to become one of the biggest companies in the video game market. This market is RAPIDLY growing and changing, making it all the more possible for GME to suck up a decent percent of the market share. Not just for selling copies of games, but selling peripherals as well, pc parts, and they’re even stepping into esports (I think) which will be huge in the next decade. This is why it’s a growth stock, yet is slowly becoming a value play because of recent events. They paid off almost all of their long term debt, raised 551MM by selling shares (which even made the price go up after this announcement. lmao), and currently have a market cap of 12.5BB. Comparatively, this is small relative to how large the market for gaming is. They still are pivoting their business model so their finances aren’t going to reflect this for at least a year if they pull off their strategy. I have faith they will be able to considering the new directors hired on, and their decision to compensate upper level management with shares rather than salaries. 

The company is making some good strategic moves for the future, and the markets showing indications of fuckery afoot, which arguably can be blamed on the cultish following looking for anything that they can say is correlated.

123,IMO," I think today Apple is somewhat to expensive, I wouldn’t buy simply because I do think the market will go through a big change. Not only Apple but all tech companies will see a big shake once the shortage of semiconductors levels put in a year, maybe 2. With Intel and TSMC(this one been the main supplier for apple chips) announcement of 30-40B on fab space in Arizona for 5nm fabs and government pushing for trillions in development, I think we will hit a point where supply is greater than demand in like 4-5 years which will make US supply chain more independent in this field but will also hit the market in terms of having too much capacity that we don’t really need. This will be pivotal, the supply will sure become more useful in the future but short term it might affect us in a negative way. I think this will hit all big tech companies, Apple included, but Apple also has the advantage of moving to ARM earlier than any other company of its size and having already amazing integration. I think this will make them recover faster companies others, they simply will have already adapted to where the market wants to go, since IMO ARM is the future of computer architecture. 
TLDR: 2 years for supply to level, 4-5 for us to see too much supply and not enough demand, and then recovery. I already own Apple shares, I wouldn’t buy today unless I’m think in short term, but I would buy in the future after this transition periods.

If a stock is trading at $100 and moves up to $110 but you believe the company to still have an attractive valuation you should buy regardless of recent price moves. So in that context, yeah, averaging up is fine.

I average up a lot, but rarely on stocks that have had a large run up because normally I won't see as much value in a stock that has say doubled in the last 6 months.

178,UWMC," All of it lmao. I did extensive research, and at one point the stock reached 7.18 for a P/E ratio of 5.05. However, in the interest of disclosure, I started buying in the mid 8's, and averaged down to 8.04.

I'm vested in the interest of the stock, because it's a good short, medium, and long term play. The Dividend Yield alone, alongside the earnings call where their CEO stated he would increase the dividend, give a special dividend, or even do stock buybacks if there was excess cash this year means that it's well positioned for income investors with a dividend yield at it's lowest above 5.5% and currently at 4.8%, not counting a dividend raise. This, alone, would make it a T stock worthy investment, without the overburdened debt load, and with strong cash flow and market share prospects.

Medium term, it's poised for rapid share appreciation between its catalysts, and the fact it's severely undervalued, and you will get a very strong Month on Month Return. This is where I stand. If it reaches my internal Month on Month Return Number, i'll likely sell the shares or sell covered calls well in the money to eke out a bit of premium on the way out in its runup.

Long Term, the housing Market in terms of purchase will continue to grow in the next few years and briskly. Furthermore, UWMC is a market leader with 34 percent of market share, poised to dominate and take further market share as the years come since the area is extremely fragmented. Furthermore, the Wholesale Channel is growing as a whole, so that's two tailwinds. Their competitive advantages in their technology ensures that time to close, and the ease of use for brokers, will sustain that market share gain in an overall growing market.

I would not normally put my eggs in one basket, but as Warren Buffet said ""It's best to be greedy when other's are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy."" And, yes, i also know he also said to invest in a small basket of stocks, if you're not going to be in an index fund.

They're a great company and I've been yelling to buy for awhile now, but you cant ignore refinance shrinking and them alienating their brokers. How do you feel about that? The positive tail winds that should have carried this company fall apart when Mat forces business elsewhere. My good friend who encouraged me a lot with my large UWM position because of his experience with them as a loan officer came to an abrupt end as they got forced out because they didn't sign the addendum. Obviously he's not the only lender who had to make that shitty choice. That, plus 76% of their origination's being refinance turned me neutral.

185,RKT," Sorry Moolium, i intend to respond to you eventually, but as for you u/_Please it's because I'm basing it off 2022 and further on. This Refinance Boom was a once in a lifetime thing (Though with this new exclusive by the WSJ regarding Freddie and Fannie helping low income people with low credit scores get a refinance. Up to 2 million could qualify for that. Here's the link:  [Mortgage Refinancing Initiative to Help Lower-Income Borrowers - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mortgage-refinancing-initiative-to-help-lower-income-borrowers-11619616615)). That would further the refinance boom along further through the summer and  a little beyond. It's expected that Purchase is much stronger here, and from here on out, and that it should be for the next 4-6 years. Plus with the undersupply of homes (Near 4 Million), things are just getting started, as it will take years to rectify the long term imbalance.

To answer your question this is why i am bullish on UWMC as opposed to RKT (Other than their P/E valuation). ""This is problematic for Rocket because the company is more reliant on refinancings than purchase mortgages. Susquehanna analyst Jack Micenko said last year that while Rocket controlled 9% to 11% of the refinancing mortgage market between 2018 and 2020, its share of the purchase mortgage market was in the 2% to 3% range."" UWMC has a much stronger advantage in the purchase market than does Rocket, and while Rocket may want to get an advantage by furthering its market share in the Wholesale business, they prefer the higher margin retail side. Furthermore, they tout a 91% stickiness across all their loan vehicles, so if you buy a home through them you're 91 percent likely to get your auto loan through them. This incentives them to cut the middleman out, and i can understand why there is a lot of people who are against Rocket in that respect. After all, they don't want what Zillow did to retailers, to happen to Mortgage Brokers. Especially since UWMC expects it to grow, unless stunted by the cutting out of the middle men. UWMC is also entirely in the wholesale channel, so they don't have an incentive to fuck over Brokers.

Let me be clear, UWMC's tech is pretty much universally praised, and they let brokerages use that tech, even if their not routing their mortgages through them. Even the person who wants to file a class action lawsuit admits this (To be clear that lawsuit has almost no chance of winning on the merits), Their time to close, on their website has ticked down from 15-16, to 14 and less to prove it.

Furthermore, just today they upped their prime jumbo from 2 million to 3 million, and offer better terms. They also started allowing manufactured home originations through them.

Like, it's a very strong business, with a competitive attitude. Their CEO stated of the 4500 who did business with both Rocket and UWMC, less than 500-600 refused the addendum. It sucks for your friend, but the market is so hot right now that it shouldn't even matter. There are 73-75 other mortgage brokers other than the 3 companies (UWMC, RKT, and that other one).

It's an aggressive business move, but it's a strong one to make. If they didn't think they'd win, they wouldn't have issued it. It's really as simple as that. I'm investing in this company based on fact, not emotion. It sucks for your friend, but it's good for UWMC.

Edit: Just wanted to cite the number exactly. Here you go.

GME hitting 1k or more was only somewhat realistic during the initial squeeze, when short interest was at 130% of the float. If it didn’t happen then, it’s not happening now, since the short interest is only around 30%. 

You might get some moves up here and there on some good news or something but there isn’t really a chance that you’re gonna get the same type of returns as the original short squeeze. The only reason why the price is still sitting near 200 is because of the hundreds of thousands of people on Reddit pumping it up right now.

448,DD," It smells funny in here. First off, I hold a double digit position and I couldn't care less about the MOASS, the company is going up. Short version:

1. They have no debt, billions on their balance sheet and positive cash flow.
2. The stock is trading at two times sales (and that is 2020 sales, they are going up last and running quarter).
3. The company has hired lots of directors and execs that could have made a lot of money staying with their old employers. Just like everyone else they neither hate money nor reputation. They would not have signed up with a failing company, so obviously Ryan Cohen has presented them with a clear vision of what is to come.

Now to the MOASS. I have not signed up to the subs mainly because I don't want my feed spammed with the memes and stuff. I think that ""DD"" posts have increased in quality.

We know that the reported SI is likely untrue, even assuming they don't misreport to FINRA. FTDs are massive, there's unusual options activity in suspicious intervals. There have been good arguments made that retail alone owns the float. The price movement makes no sense and the Dark Pool activity is suspicious as hell.

Shorts have not covered. Their DD told them the stock was going to go back below 20 and historically they could push retail around, so they tried just that. I think the media activity is indicative of that. When in doubt, watch the video where Cramer describes how short HFs manipulate the narrative again.

Where is it going to go? I don't know, but they had to put the emergency brake on after 400$ in January. Let's just say I would certainly not consider selling in the low 1000s, as the stock can make that by itself in a few years.

Can it go up to ten million? I think in theory yes. The question is if liquidating banks or the government will let it. I say no to the first, but the government has an interest in something happening, so you never know:

1. Retail pays taxes and actually spends the money on the economy.

453,GME," I have hopped on and off the GME train a few times.

I do not get into the hype personally but profit from it when I can.

GME is still all hype and very little substance to justify the current price.

At the point you see 50+ WSB posts on ""HODL THE LINE"" the pump is already in and those 50 people are looking for bagholders as they make a smooth exit and its easy to dump your shares, block style.

Hype fades and the stock reverts to the mean. This is true for BOTH short squeezes as well as hype-based pump n dumps and GME is a rare combination of both.

I took my profits and didn't regret it a single time.

454,GME," Not in on GME, but just as general comment you put an evaluation on GME and compare it to legit stocks that rose over years and decades to their value, that's a mistake. I don't know what the current thesis on GME is, but the idea of it reaching such numbers is based on shorts being forced to cover due to margin calls, and this would happen at similar times for many since many shorted at similar times. If that happens a snowball effect can get started and ramp up the price enormously.

That said, I'm not sure why people make up such numbers. 
A lot compare it to VW in 2008, but Porsche owned 43% of VW shares, the German government 20% and there was not a lot left. Why does this matter? Retail investors are not an entity. If you own 99% as a single person you function as 1 brain and can watch it shoot up without selling. Then you sell at the highest point. But here, people will sell way before that and that happened previously already. 

Now, since GME hit a way new overvalued level I am sure a lot of shorts that left and had to pay went back in, probably not the same, maybe the same, but it should be at a high level. But that means if these opened their positions at 350-500 AND didn't already close it when it hit 39$, which would be stupid, then it's the same situation as before but instead of starting at 20$ it's now at a way higher level. On one hand that means it's way harder to break, but shorts pay higher interest now. So if a similar or even same scenario happens, then this could probably easily reach 700-800$. But as I said, it's way harder to reach the same goal as before. When it hit 360 it was 12 times over the most shorted amount of 20$. To reach a 12 times limit right now at probably 200$ it would need to reach 3600$ per share to have the same trigger. There was a big change where you need to have the money to short something, though I am not sure if that impacted risk or volume. If it's volume, then that sucks. If it's risk, then that could mean the 12 times is instead ""only"" 6 times or even just 2 times. Which is still way higher as before but more manageable.",oodex,1,/r/stocks/comments/n006p3/an_idiot_seeking_clarity_serious/gw5cif3/,0.079,0.856,0.065,-0.8313

483,YUMC," Part of the problem is their brand makes them so immobile. I bet if coke made a weed base drink they’d make a ton of money, at the expense of their other business. If they focus less on soda, are they really even Coca-Cola? 

MCD is much more interesting, since they have locations and all sorts of fun stuff, but the same problems that coke has. More health conscious market spends less on fast food, yadda yadda you know my lines. 

I’d lean more to YUMC, specifically because China has a fast growing consumer spending and I’m sure they will love Taco Bell like my high ass does.

With those pressures coming from both sides I'd be surprised if it doesn't bring the margins you get for weed down to the same you get for special tomatoes.

522,AMD," Stocks are currently over valued. We are in speculation mode. 

Honestly your best bet would be to just put it all in AMD at 85 and hold it for a year and then sell. 

Once the fed starts to taper the market will see a huge correction. You'll be gambling that the fed won't do that in the next 12 months. 

This is terrible advice but it's honestly probably the best advice. You could see a 20% gain with AMD in the next 12 months. 

Chase released a report that showed an expected 4% return over the next decade. In other words, we are at or near the top of this cycle and the next decade will have very poor returns. 

AMD isn't speculation. It's valued at 115 and is trading at 85. But there are stocks trading at 4-10x intrinsic value. 

Another idea is to take that 40k, pay down your mortgage and refinance (if you haven't already). You'll get a guaranteed return of 3%. That's infinity larger than a loss. Then you can take your increased cash flow from a smaller mortgage and buy VOO on a regular interval. Dollar cost averaging is the way to go. You could dollar cost average the 40k over 12 months but you'd have 40k mostly doing nothing during that time period. 

This is the worst time to put a lump sum into stocks.

Usually I batch my trading. I am on the west coast, so I wake up at 6:20 and am ready to place trades at opening. My trading window closes by 7:30, when the regular day starts. At 10 or 11 I earmark another 30 minutes to adjust the sails for the day and exit positions that missed the mark. At 12:45 I get back on until market closes.

557,TTM," I'm the editor of the Investor Advisory Service (IAS), so I can perhaps provide some info.

All three of these newsletters have long track records that have been validated by [HulbertRatings.com](https://HulbertRatings.com). In particular, Marketimer and IAS have both been on the Hulbert Investment Newsletter Honor Roll for the past 11 years. This means that they have both outperformed all bull and bear market cycles since 3/31/2000, providing a more consistent result for subscribers along the way (going up more than the market during bull cycles and falling less than the market in bear cycles). The Honor Roll approach for measuring performance puts less emphasis on the newsletters that turn in super results during bull cycles but then fall off severely during bear cycles (or vice versa), so there will be other newsletters that top the performance rankings for different periods.

For instance, Nate's Notes' ""Wagamore Advisory Letter"" is currently the best performing newsletter for the TTM as of 3/31/2021, but the worst performing newsletter for the last 5 years. There's nothing wrong with this, but subscribers should understand the range of returns for different periods and market cycles that a newsletter typically achieves so they can avoid dumping the newsletter picks during periods of underperformance. This is often difficult to do -- if the market is up 30% and your newsletter picks are down 30%, it can be hard to sit tight even if that's the best thing you could do. Hulbert's Honor Roll methodology is meant to filter newsletters so that the ones that qualify will generate ""smoother"" returns over time.

Marketimer is more short-term in focus and attempts to time purchases and sales (as suggested by the name), while Nate's Notes and IAS are more long-term focused. Nate's Notes makes changes to its model portfolio almost monthly, while it's possible to be a buy-and-hold investor following IAS picks and only make a few portfolio adjustments a year. This is important to consider based on how you want to monitor your own portfolio and how often you are willing to make changes.

All of Hulbert's calculated returns are based on pre-tax figures, so that's something to consider when selecting a newsletter -- are you investing in a tax-advantaged account like an IRA or in a taxable account? A short-term focused newsletter may have more gains taxable at short-term rates, which would cause some decay in your personal returns.

IAS only covers stocks, Marketimer uses mutual funds, and Nate's Notes recommend ETFs and stocks.

Nate's Notes and Marketimer offer model portfolios that are for intended for subscribers to follow, while IAS leaves portfolio construction to subscribers according to their own objectives, preferences, and tolerances. IAS covers about 90 stocks in total with updated buy/sell prices each month and 3 more complete recommendations in each monthly issue. Nate's covers about 20 securities in total with some hedging investments & ETFs along with stocks. Marketimer typically includes even fewer securities in his Model Portfolio I, with just a handful of funds.

Since IAS doesn't offer a model portfolio like most other newsletters, Hulbert constructs a hypothetical portfolio of all picks we designate as being in a ""buy"" price range and rebalances it each month accordingly. In practice, few subscribers would follow this same procedure, so individual subscriber returns will vary. This is likely the case even with newsletters that offer model portfolio since many subscribers probably don't automatically execute every portfolio change recommended by the newsletter.

Any other questions, let me know.",gerlach,2,/r/stocks/comments/n0f8zo/newsletter_bob_brinkers_marketimer_vs_investory/gw6p86p/,0.041,0.857,0.102,0.9881
558,ADP," You can download a sample issue from Nate's Notes' website (as well as from the IAS website), and that might give you a better idea of the differences. It looks like Nate's Notes is making multiple buy/sell decisions each month, whereas I would expect that our IAS subscribers are making a handful of buy/sell decisions a year (once they've established their portfolio). IAS is steadfastly devoted to a 5-year horizon, which is a risk management technique that prevents kneejerk decisions and lets company management drive EPS and sales growth over the course of several years.

Cabot is another long-standing newsletter publisher, and they offer several different publications. Their Turnaround Letter uses a value investing approach, which can be successful but also can be very difficult to implement since you are buying stocks that the rest of the market hates. John Buckingham's The Prudent Speculator newsletter is one of the best value newsletters, but returns are prone to swings in underlying sentiment about value vs. growth.

The Buyback Letter has several portfolios that you can follow (if you're looking for income, tech stocks, healthcare/biotech stocks, or the broader market). They also offer a Dogs of the Dow type portfolio -- the Dow 30 stocks that are the most beaten-down (and thus have the highest yields) and are also buying back shares. Personally, I look at stocks that are buying back shares in significant amounts as being a bit troublesome -- it can mean that the stock is in crisis management mode and the board wants to boost the stock, or that the company has too much cash that it doesn't have anything more worthwhile to do with it (such as reinvesting in its business), for instance. As companies have slowed their dividend increases in the last several decades in favor of using cash for share buybacks, I wonder about the overall effectiveness of this approach in the current market and business environment.

Jim Stack's Investech newsletter uses stocks (mostly large-caps), funds, and ETFs in an active strategy. Each month there might be a handful of recommended actions to take, and it's not uncommon for the newsletter to push the portfolio into significant cash levels. (We have a longstanding subscriber to the IAS newsletter who is also a fan of Stack; she manages the portfolio in their household, and at a MoneyShow a few years ago, she made a point of introducing her husband to Stack and instructing her husband that if she should die before him, he should just give all their investing assets to Stack's management service.)

The [HulbertRatings.com](https://HulbertRatings.com) website has returns for 1-year to 30-years for all newsletters that they cover, so that's the best place for an apples-to-apples comparison of results.

What's interesting is that the top-performing newsletters don't represent a single investment style or approach in just about any period. You'll find newsletters that follow growth, value, fundamental, technical, market timing, or income strategies, and that use commodities, ETFs, mutual funds, stocks, and options.

Many newsletters do require constant portfolio action, where each month there might be several changes that they advise subscribers to make; others are more of the ""set it and forget it"" approach. \[Aside: When we say that IAS focuses on the long-term, we mean it -- in November 2020, we recommended buying ADP for the fourth time. The previous recommendations were in May 1997, February 1990, and June 1975. ADP was $2.91 (split-adjusted) in June 1975 and closed yesterday at $195. It's been at least a hold in the newsletter for a very long time.\] But selecting a newsletter that works with your expectations for monthly transactions and strategy can do better for you in the real world than the hypothetical returns in a performance table.",gerlach,1,/r/stocks/comments/n0f8zo/newsletter_bob_brinkers_marketimer_vs_investory/gw7zy64/,0.04,0.833,0.127,0.9942

Revenues of $158.4 million were 11.1% below the year-ago quarter and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $159 million due to lower-than-expected revenue-generating horsepower capacity, which, at 3,004,069 horsepower, fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3,009,000 horsepower.

Joe Manchin and some other moderate Dems are starting to push back pretty strongly against the Biden agenda. it's all gonna get watered down significantly 

Biden is just dumb for proposing this, anyway. the best way to get more government revenue is to LOWER tax rates. to quote the economist Thomas Sowell 

>The facts are unmistakably plain, for those who bother to check the facts. In 1921, when the tax rate on people making over $100,000 a year was 73 percent, the federal government collected a little over $700 million in income taxes, of which 30 percent was paid by those making over $100,000. By 1929, after a series of tax rate reductions had cut the tax rate to 24 percent on those making over $100,000, the federal government collected more than a billion dollars in income taxes, of which 65 percent was collected from those making over $100,000.

Whereas a bank like Goldman has a much lower PE ratio because whilst it is a huge reliable cash cow, ultimately a mature bank just can’t grow like a big tech company can.

- RYCEY - Rolls Royce, nothing to do with the cars btw (they sold that to BMW years ago) - they’re an industrial powerhouse, think a leaner/nimbler version of GE. They have big defence contracts, burgeoning green tech, nuclear power station contracts - their bread and butter is jet engines which has obviously been hit hard, but they’ve raised $10bn in funding now so have ample liquidity even if airline travel doesn’t recover.

And if there is a big recovery - currently it has a $12bn market cap, pretty much half of it what it was pre covid. If jet engine orders go back to pre Covid levels, they’ll be making $2bn profit a year. Plus you get exposure to their other research eg green tech

BP - similarly massively down from pre Covid levels. Nowadays it’s trendy to sh*t all over big oil, but ultimately whatever happens with green tech, oil will be huge for the next 20-30 yrs minimum (not just cars it’s used in plastics and tons of other materials everyone uses daily). When things go back to normal it should recover 50%+ hopefully

Boeing - similar story to Rolls Royce, still massively below pre pandemic levels. Unless you think air travel will stay low permanently, should be huge scope for recovery

REITs are also worth looking into imho, I own a few - they’ve been beaten up badly during Covid and obviously retail/office has been hit badly, but again I would expect the worst to be behind them - yet many of them are still substantially below pre Covid levels

So yeah that’s my “old economy” basket of stocks - despite not being as exciting as tech, I’m actually doing very well so far (up around 30% since start of the year) - of course it very much depends on the speed of the recovery",introspective79,1,/r/stocks/comments/n0giy6/overvalued_stock_market/gw80aae/,0.073,0.839,0.088,0.4655

605,LOTZ, I actually bought it today but not for a short squeeze but an earnings play. It’s stabilized in April after a brutal decline and is undervalued here. I also sold a Call Spread.
