33,OR," are you that dumb?

\- is THIS true:  
<<life expectancy for people who die young is low>>  
...   <duh?>.. really ?

Your definition of ""poors"" includes what percentage of the population? .. and WHY are they dying faster?.. OR **MAYBE** the percentage of poors is GROWING and there are many MORE of them, but still living as long ??

If you have 50% ""poor"" and 50% ""rich"" and the poor die at 50 and the rich die at 60, then the average age of death will be 55, right?

but if you have 90% poor and 10% rich the average age of death will be 51

So now if the poor start to live a year LONGER and the rich live a year **SHORTER** then the average age of USA death will RISE by MORE than a year.  
= too bad for the rich.

Did you check where your OWN income fits into the life expectancy graph .. or your weight, or your job, or your sex, or your State, or your sport, or your IQ?

If you habitually get **blowjobs** from **whores** in your **lambo** while snorting wealthy quantities of **coke** you will live a **long time**? -LOL-

And AMC will go right back to being a dying movie theater getting fucked into irrelevancy by a growing number of streaming services. They are even releasing movies straight to streaming platforms now... 

AMC is just trying to kick the can down the road and get as big of bonuses as possible for execs as they ride off into retirement and leave behind a dead company in a few years time.",lJustLurkingl,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o3460o/wish_it_literally_couldnt_go_tits_up_until_it_did/h2bye1m/,0.124,0.796,0.08,-0.8555

250,WKHS," Reason why it's so heavily shorted and been for a few months is mainly the loss of the USPS contract to Oshkosh back in February. Everyone pretty much expected it to happen and would've been worth a few billion over a number of years as the contract was to electrify the majority of the USPS delivery fleet. That, together with production being very slow and then being investors of Lordstown have also negatively impacted their earnings. HOWEVER, the circumstances of Oshkosh being awarded the USPS contract seem suspicious (they didnt even make electric vehicles) and WKHS filed a lawsuit against USPS last Wednesday on grounds that losing the contract was unfair

Edit: An article from last week on the current WKHS situation and lawsuit: https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/06/16/usps-trucks-workhorse-lawsuit/ 

Something I didn't note earlier is a securities filing from Oshkosh themselves saying in Nov 2020 that they ""didn't have the expertise or resources to build electric vehicles""... and they won the contract 3 months later.

It‚Äôs a shitty way to do business and it used to work until retail caught on and just refused to sell their shares to the HFs. The thing is the HFs won‚Äôt accept that their age old tried and true tactics won‚Äôt work anymore so they keep borrowing shares, even creating them out of thin air if they have to, and keep piling on the short interest.

358,GME," When a MM sells you calls they are now in a short call position - which is bad for them because now they are no longer delta neutral.  MM's always want to be delta neutral - they make money on the bid / ask spread - not when a stock goes up or down.

If they don't remain delta neutral they could get blown out if a black swan event occurs - like a Sept 11, or a meme stock goes nuts like GME.   And some do occasionally when they start using leverage and it goes against them.

Anyway - the way to offset being short a call is with a synthetic long call - returning them to delta neutral.  So they would buy an equivalent of underlying shares and buy an equivalent amount of underlying puts which = a synthetic long call.

They now are short an actual call but own a synthetic long call.  Stock goes up and the short calls are worth more (they lose money) but so are the shares they now own (making them an equivalent amount) offsetting any risk to them.

He's a talking head, on TV. His whole paycheck is dependent on people liking him, or at least trusting him enough to turn in for ratings. Fawning over fund managers and CEOs is one way to get these people on the show (they don't need money, most of the time, they need their ego's stroked), and retail investors a la WSB have (rightly) screwed with ""the system"", of which he is a part. Reverting course when WSB and individual stock buying retail investors are starting to be a new significant thing (rather than just sticking to pension funds, 401k managed funds and index funds, like the upper middle class used to do in decades past), is par for the course, for both politicians and entertainers alike

509,BB," i don't think Canada will ever sell Blackberry or QNX. They basically own the iot/smart city space and cybersecurity space. Lot of people don't understand the tech blackberry has today...it's basically god of all gods!!! Spark and QNX will rule the world and like CEO said....bb will be in EVERYTHING YOU TOUCH!! 

look at my previous QNX design wins article. Basically anyone serious about iot devices have signed up to use QNX. It's a secure platform that can be connected to internet. From drones to meters to lights to cars to trucks to industrial robots to all robots!! There is no way Canada will sell BB. This is why canada government invested in BB few years back.

516,FORD," that wasn't the point of this post. the point was that the stock price took a hit because of FUD put out by hedge funds and fake sites without contacting or researching. Blackberry was never dropped by Ford but every site that covered it basically said QNX is no longer used by Ford, which is false. This article is to clear that fud and let everyone know that FORD has like 15 modules that have QNX and QNX Hypervisor!!!!

This is not priced into the stock price. Wallstreet has not priced in the revenue from QNX, Ivy, or Spark. They are still pricing blackberry as a hardware company...look at the multiples. Having leadership in car software space and iot space and having best cybersecurity in the world deserves much much much higher market cap and stock price ($140 lets talk)!",ModernBuddha1,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o36b6k/ford_drop_blackberry_qnx_for_google_android_really/h2c4lox/,0.061,0.837,0.103,0.8608

609,AMC," AMC was never a ‚Äúvalue‚Äù investment imho.  Maybe when it was so far down (like $2.00) it had very short term strategy, even at $8-$10 as well.  But until the world as we know it returns to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù where no one has to fear for their lives leaving their house, if I was invested in AMC, I would have sold it at $50+.  Any smart invested would do the same and walk away from it.  One always needs an exit plan.   Or at least enough shares to sell CC‚Äôs on it to average down to a level where they could take the loss.

611,AMC," Your spot on, but your talking to people who think the hedge funds are losing billions a week not covering.  When i say losing, they think every week the shorts don't cover costs them billions of new dollars.  This is how they math.  When half your premise is 1000% wrong (again, using real math) your beyond fuk.  They also believe increased reverse repo usage is because shorts need to borrow money to pay these billions of dollars weekly.  Obviously, they so far into the Donny Kruger experiment there is no saving them.   

I think at this point, the funds have positioned so well that they are just making fat premiums and toying with these apes.  They bleed it slowly to keep hope alive.  

Essentially, AMC peeps own 25bil of 3bil company and paying dearly to keep it overvalued.  The greatest cuck of all time.  All the hedge funds have to do is feed the paranoia and paint the tape.  They will collect premiums and once apes lose faith ride all the way back down to about 10bil, where a handful of these dummies will baghold forever.",OhNoMoFomo,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o314nl/where_was_the_amc_squeeze/h29kxsr/,0.099,0.777,0.124,0.808

AMC investors probably saw AMC as being ""cheaper"" and incorrectly thought AMC at $60 a share could be like GME and go to 300$ or higher like GME.

Ask yourself, why is the media constantly talking about AMC?  The media rarely ever mentions GME. Seems like they really want to you notice AMC.  Why? Because the media is in bed with corporations and HFs that are long AMC.

Looking at the data you have as a retail trader, look at the buy/sell orders on Fidelity.

If you compare GME and AMC, you see AMC has far more ""paper hands"" than what you have been lead to believe.

The shorts had to work really hard to get it down to $12 last week, raising the short interest from low 40% up to 48%. I think there is a greater than 50% chance your calls are ITM at some point over the next month.

769,BB," I've been watching shares available to borrow for clov in multiple brokers every day for the past two weeks and it has been fluctuating by hundreds of thousands daily, usually starting the day with 200k-400k and dropping to 50k-100k by mid-afternoon. In other words, there is definitely a lot of shorting activity going on.

As shares are short sold, the shares available to borrow gets replenished, but the fact that it keeps getting depleted shows that huge short sales are occurring which keeps the share price down.

Short selling activity certainly happens on other stocks I've watched, but I've never really seen it happen day after day after day (exception is this also happens with AMC). If you look at BB, they usually have around 39m volume and somewhere around 10m shares available to short, and that number doesn't change much - it was basically the same all week last week. So it's very strange to me that CLOV consistently has less than 500k available to short with similar mkt cap and volume to BB... (clov also has about 40m volume per day).

787,CLOV," The past week CLOV short interest has notably increased, but you're right, the share price is still up from where it was when CLOV was under the radar. This can only mean one thing - that CLOV now has a lot of (bag) holders that are sticking to their guns and going long.

Short squeezes are triggered by unexpected price increases in heavily shorted stocks. I consider the current price bump from where CLOV was 3-4 weeks ago an ""unexpected price increase""... Currently shorts are trying to wait it out (while also increasing their short positions). They're waiting for WSB to lose interest as they always do and move onto something else. The question is will the new CLOV army be able to wait out the hedge funds that have been increasing their short positions to instigate FUD and shake out WSB. Personally, I think all the new investors that have been introduced to CLOV as a result of the price surge are here to stay and some of the hedge funds will eventually realize that they're better off being the first to cover rather than paying the 7%+ fee to maintain their positions.

796,AMC," I fail to see how that has any influence on AMC at this point. When it was trading at $15-20, sure that was definitely a factor, but now? The real move has already happened and its taking AMC about 200 million volume a day to essentially just trade sideways. This level of volume won't keep up forever and the risk for any new money coming in to take the trade is significantly greater at this point.

AMC right now presents the same underlying factors for short volume, options open interest, and float as WISH along with similar levels of daily volume yet I would feel 100% more comfortable taking WISH at these levels than AMC. I'm not taking WISH personally because I do believe it is a hype play now but it shows more potential upside right now with less downside. AMC shows limited upside with more potential downside.

When it comes to CLOV, it has a better set up across the board compared to AMC right now so taking it here just makes more logical trading sense.

1. Smaller float so less volume needed to make moves.
2. The highest short interest around right now which keeps going UP each day.
3. Almost half of the entire float is borrowed short (42 million shares) yet only about 100-300k shares available each day to cover. As of Friday close there is only 30k available after significant ladder attacks.
4. Highest borrow fees of any other meme stock that topped more than 116% when it was going last week. This alone is an indication of how screwed shorts are and when more shares are available to borrow the fees have been going UP. That doesn't make sense unless the same shares are being covered and then re-borrowed again since no other shares can be taken to bring it down.
5. More than $5 billion lost so far in June and its BARELY done anything yet.

799,GME," I fail to see how that has any influence on AMC at this point. When it was trading at $15-20, sure that was definitely a factor, but now? The real move has already happened and its taking AMC about 200 million volume a day to essentially just trade sideways. This level of volume won't keep up forever and the risk for any new money coming in to take the trade is significantly greater at this point.

AMC right now presents the same underlying factors for short volume, options open interest, and float as WISH along with similar levels of daily volume yet I would feel 100% more comfortable taking WISH at these levels than AMC. I'm not taking WISH personally because I do believe it is a hype play now but it shows more potential upside right now with less downside. AMC shows limited upside with more potential downside.

When it comes to CLOV, it has a better set up across the board compared to AMC right now so taking it here just makes more logical trading sense.

1. Smaller float so less volume needed to make moves.
2. The highest short interest around right now which keeps going UP each day.

Long term it‚Äôll take off based on all the analytics due to a variety of reasons you can do your own research on. Just don‚Äôt FOMO like me and buy in the upper 30s if you are looking to get into CRSR in the next couple weeks.

872,AMD," Nvidia doesnt make their chips for their high end graphics cards. Micron does. 

Nvidia is a solid company from a product standpoint. I just built a gaming computer and used the highest end parts available for gaming. I use a nvidia rtx3090 and intel i910900k for a cpu.

As someone who is in this market as a consumer i feel safe speaking on it. Nvidia is awesome. But right now AMD is about to sweep the whole market.

AMD not only has very comparable graphics cards at a better price point but they also make their own cpus. 

AMD at the moment is gaining major ground. Their flagship cpus are THE BEST for workstations. Point blank. No comparisson. Their multi core cpu like the 5950x is actually as good as intels i910900k processor for gaming if not just a cunt hair better...plus it blows intel out of the water for multicore uses but at 2x the price. I used intels 10900k in my gaming build as it is neck and neck for the best cpu for gaming for half the cost. I have no use for the amd 5950x because i dont do content creation or stream. If i did i hands down wouldvw went for the 5950x.

Mind you the split has been approved and is coming in July.  This should make options more affordable, thank God.  I like the 90 day contract on NVDA because sometimes it trades sideways, or you buy at the wrong time, but it always recovers.

Just be patient and wait for the next sell off.  And then right before you buy, wait another 48 hours.  Watch the MACD chart.

Target?  Who the fuck knows.  Monday could be end of days, or the market could shrug shit off.

1073,RUN," Solar roofs are definitely not popular. The market is very niche because they're only viable in areas with like 14 hours of direct sunlight year round. So, basically, southern California, Texas, Arizona, and Florida. They also cost over $30,000 for the most basic of roofs and last maybe 30 years. Metal roofs will last over 50 years at half that price and shingles 10-15 years for 1/5 of the price. If you factor in what you're not paying in electricity, you would be lucky to break even with any other roof. 

If this is a long play, the technology isn't there yet and it's a gamble at best.

RUN also has a negative EPS. They lost money last year whereas they were actually profitable for at least the previous 4 years, so something is going wrong. The years they were profitable: they were barely profitable, with net incomes of small cap companies trading OTC, definitely not worth over $10/share.
