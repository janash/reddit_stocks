17,USA," My 2 cents: this is propaganda made by politicians to make some headlines and pretend that these G7 meetings (whose attendants, btw, are not ‘the Great 7’ powers since 20-30 years) are somewhat useful. 

Why?

For a starter, they only agreed in principle, which is meaningless. How an actual global legislation or agreement on taxation would look like or be enforced is all to be seen. Until you see the paper, this is just an empty promise to a room full of journalist. 

Secondly, even the principle (15% minimum corporate tax rate globally) is meaningless, because all the 7 countries have already higher tax rate. What they would need to do is close tax loops that allow corporates to LEGALLY move profits abroad. For this they don’t need any globs treaty, they can just change their local tax codes. 

Finally, tax ‘competition’ is encouraged in the European Union (which many of these countries belong to) and in general globally. 

Let’s start with Europe. Inside the EU Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Ireland, Cyprus, Malta and to some extent Greece (on ship taxation) all use lower corporate taxation to their benefit at the expense of larger EU states. Geographicaly inside the EU, Switzerland also does. The EU is a dead project that is reluctant of any change since 20+ years. These countries all have vast power inside EU insitutions and have used it consinstely to make sure legislation is not changed in regard of ‘tax competition’ between EU members. In plain terms, EU members couldn’t even agree on a common travel policy in times of covid (with good riddance to the principles of Schenghen and weaponization of COVID issues against Britain in times of brexit), do you think they will ever agree to have a minimum corporate tax? 

Outside the EU, the USA already has one of the lowest tax rates for a developed country.  Of course Biden now signs these ‘agreements’ and promises change, but believe me the USA have very little to earn or lose from different corporate tax when they only represent something like 6% of total tax revenues as of 2020. Add that they are only talking about making the minimum 15%... which is below what they already have. Nothing would really change for them. 

What actually matters is to close tax loops that allow companies to not pay taxes in the countries where they register profit. To do so, the US does not need any global agreement and neither does Europe. They should just change their respective tax codes ...which they won’t do. 

Reminds me of some news a few months ago when banks and big corporations in the USA signed some sort of agreement saying that from there on they would consider their impact on the environment and not only return to shareholders. Have you ever heard anything from them ever since?

They could pay for a very expensive widget from Apple Ireland, an expensive app (Apple Ireland now owns the calculator app and Apple France needs to pay $50 for any device they sell with it installed), a patent, rent, ""consulting"", etc. Basically anything.

Which is why the law would have to be incredibly broad to have teeth (any expenses paid to a company in a non-compliant country generates a tax liability).

This would have a massive negative impact on many companies that aren't evading taxes. For example, a small business that imports rugs from Lebanon to sell. They would have no control on if Lebanon becomes compliant and the increased taxes could put them out of business.

Part of this could be helped by only having it impact companies over a certain size or at a sliding scale.

81,GME," You're not completely wrong. As the DMM for GME, they are allowed to produce synthetic shares in times of illiquidity... So long as they locate a share to balance the books within a certain number of days. Note that this isn't necessarily short selling, which is where you sell a stock with the promise to buy it back after a certain amount of time because you think it will be cheaper. Short sells are also supposed to be recorded as a short sell instead of a normal sale.  
&nbsp;  
The overall problem is whether they were abusing that DMM role to flood the market with synthetic shares to devalue the stock; and whether they located real shares to balance out the synthetic shares. The retail investors in various communities believe that they have not, and that retail controls the float several times over.  
&nbsp;  
If the retail investors are correct in their theory, then Citadel will be forced to cover their shorts and puts and buy back every single share they counterfeited. The question is *when* would that happen; as hedge funds will never accept that they lost a bet - especially one they rigged. Therefore, it will likely come down to either: a gamma squeeze (buying frenzy) to drive the price above their assets for payment level and force the DTCC to Margin Call them; or the price of their other assets dropping due to market shifts (such as a recession or other market plummet).",Superstonkfollow,1,/r/stocks/comments/nskazq/wall_street_reins_in_hedge_funds_short_bets_on/h0q84wk/,0.072,0.825,0.104,0.5304

120,GME," Shorting a stock is borrowing shares to sell if you're bearish on a stock and Hopefully being able to return the shares at a lower price while pocketing the difference. (Borrow and sell @10 then buy back and return at 5 so you keep 5 bucks per share minus fees). 

Naked short selling is when they do this without locating shares to borrow and when they do this in a extremely predatory way, without intention to return the shares via shorting them into bankruptcy. 

The big problem is that short selling dilutes the float and in extreme cases like GME and I'm sure many others, 1 share can be shorted multiple times and there's no limit or restrictions enforced to stop this. (B borrows from A and sell to C. A has the actual share and C is holding a borrowed share. Now D comes in and borrows C's borrowed share and sells to E so on and so forth.) Suddenly you have 1 share but multiple ""fake shares"" out there that are being traded like regular shares. Now at some point these shares must be returned and if the price has risen from the time the shares were shorted, the shorters are at a loss and when they all rush to cover their shorts is what causes the short squeeze.

Yes, it is prevalent out there. Watch superstonk YouTube interview with Wes Christian to learn more. Some good info there.",sadlifestrife,21,/r/stocks/comments/nszoju/is_naked_shorting_truly_a_common_practice/h0pex98/,0.053,0.777,0.169,0.9711

133,AMC," Well for one institutions love to loan out their shares because it is free money.  Unlike retail where the broker gets the fee for loaning out shares the institutions get that money themselves.  Also remember that institutions are just companies.  This can include hedge funds as well as mutual fund companies like Vanguard, Blackrock etc.  So all of the shares backing up your ETFs and Mutual Funds will happily be leant out.  This is especially true for index funds where the fund manager has zero care whether or not the underlying companies go up or down.  As far as how you get over 100% it is not that hard of a concept.

Person A has 100 Shares.

Person S1 borrows those 100 Shares from Person A and Sells them to Person B.

Person S2 borrows those 100 shares from Person B and sells them to Person C.

Person A now has 100 synthetic shares

Person B now has 100 synthetic shares

Person C now has 100 real shares

Person S1 now has short 100 shares.

Person S2 now has short 100 shares.

The short interest is now 200% as there are 200 shares short on 100 share float and 200 synthetic shares.  

The only reason short sellers have to pay a high price to cover is if they get margin called which means the margin loan exceeds the safety levels in their portfolio and the broker is worried that if the stock keeps going up the short seller would be unable to afford to cover.  They may choose to reduce their exposure by covering part of their position early to prevent a margin call but in that case they wouldn't have to.

What evidence is there that AMC had to bail out short sellers?

The fact that you think all shorting is naked shorting tells me you actually don't care what the correct facts are.

So, to introduce the topic further to you, what do you think happens if the share price drops to 0 and then the company is bankrupt? The regular shares no longer exist, so poof - all the illegal naked shorts vanish, hiding what they did. And ya know what else? There's a tax loophole - since they didn't technically close the short positions (the shares instead ceased to exist), they do not have to pay any tax on their gains.

They had pushed GME down to $2 before this all started via massive naked shorting. We've caught them in the act, and now they are supremely fucked.

This is merely the tip of the iceberg, and I hope you learn more about what is going on here. r/superstonk is the place.",manbeef,1,/r/stocks/comments/nszoju/is_naked_shorting_truly_a_common_practice/h0q9k9q/,0.106,0.78,0.114,-0.3536
137,AMC," Thanks for the explanation, You lay it out simply, I was trying to explain same to my broker who insisted a share could only be loaned out once. While I was obviously not party to the AMC discussions re the bail out as I call it, by the 560% increase in the share price, the short sellers were short a ton more than they could buy. You’re clever, so you know that the price increase was exponential, were it not for an 11m dump the price would likely have been way over double that.  The timing, what a coincidence that AMC were just about to dump another 11m shares when the squeeze happened, and I no longer believe in Father Christmas. So yes, I think the shorts were bailed out by AMC, regardless of the degree to which it was orchestrated.

I take just a teeny bit of a exception to your saying I don’t care about the facts. I do care, and I’m totally willing to learn, but I also have a free brain to question the ways people justify evil. So I understand the distinction between so called naked shorting and shorting borrowed shares, I just choose not to believe the BS narrative created by the manufactured nomenclature.  If I steal your bicycle and sell it to Peter, it’s theft. If I tell the judge that Paul loaned it to me, even though it’s your bicycle, it’s still theft. Even if Peter bought it from me, paid me and sold it to John, Peter still sold what was not rightfully his, it’s still stolen property. So I see the distinction, I just call the distinction the BS it is.  In fact, I think you prove my point, in your example, there was only one block of a hundred shares. If there are 200 shares short, only 100 could ever not be naked because there’s still only one 100 block of real shares, the other 100 has to be “naked”.  The 100 shares belong to person A, only him selling them can change that.  The other two 100 blocks are what is phantom, therefor the shorts are naked.",Significant-Elk-4625,1,/r/stocks/comments/nszoju/is_naked_shorting_truly_a_common_practice/h0py8fn/,0.083,0.814,0.103,0.1574

140,IMO, Coin base’s revenue derives mainly from trading fees. IMO they’ll eventually have to lower those fees to stay competitive,Junkaccoung69691,52,/r/stocks/comments/nt0irn/what_do_you_all_think_of_coinbase_coin/h0phozr/,0.105,0.813,0.081,-0.128
141,COIN," I am bullish on COIN! Coinbase is one of the top 5 most profitable exchanges in the world. Coinbase might make more money than Nasdaq. Coinbase is going to be huge because this is the first time we are able to directly play crypto in the equity market. Why I like COIN is that it is a play on Bitcoin AND all the other coins out there...whereas bitcoin is just a play on bitcoin, so you are getting all the other coins for free. COIN is heavily (96%) tied to the price of bitcoin, which is very hard to predict. Another advantage of COIN being the first crypto exchange coming onto the market first is that they potentially can use their stock as currency to buy any other competitors. And you don't have to believe in the crypto party line and the dangers of fiat currency and how you need an alternative, because central banks all over the world are printing money like crazy - even if you think this is nonsense, we know that there is a market for this kind of nonsense because gold bugs have been saying the same thing for decades. In other words, crypto has a natural constituency. Like gold, people buy it as a kind of inflation insurance and gold's strength is its scarcity - its supply only increases about 1% per year and it is getting harder and harder to find more - that sounds a lot like Bitcoin to me and I think it is totally legitimate to believe that crypto, in general, can rival gold as a storehold of value and COIN is the biggest brand and easiest on off ramp to do that.",The_Folkhero,3,/r/stocks/comments/nt0irn/what_do_you_all_think_of_coinbase_coin/h0q34zh/,0.042,0.814,0.144,0.9798
142,COIN," I did my own research on COIN before the IPO and i reached a conclusion that I'd expect it to trade at around 600 per share within next 5 years. But i might be a bit biased due to being in crypto since 2015 and making insane amounts of money. This space doesn't stop to blow my mind and make me money every single year... And i genuinely think that the real growth of crpyto will only begin in next ~5 years. We didn't see anything significant yet. Yes, at some point in the future the COIN's revenue from fees will disappear. But by that time Coinbase will have so many other streams of revenue. Its going to be like Blackrock, Goldman Sachs, Square and all kinds of other businesses in one. Anyway, for me personally any price below 300 is amazing value (i was buying at 400 and i am buying now too). But it is absolutely ok if others disagree!

When companies go public part of the reason is to raise money, meaning, they obtain money from the public far and above what they were able to obtain privately because they are offering their company on a public stock exchange. All that money that investors give them when their buy their stock they will turn around and make an offer to a competitor like Kraken, etc, ""hey, we will give you 1.3 shares of COIN for each share of your privately held company if you agree to merge with us.""

The company has thrived together with the meteoric rise of online marketplaces like ETSY. People bought arts and crafts to pass the time at home, create masks and items to sell online, etc. 

Now that reopenings are well underway, is it realistic to think that comparables for these companies will be the same or better? Personally I don’t think so (and expect a reversion closer to 2018-2020 results).

Also, given the low operating margins and high assets (low return on assets) and high debt, I don’t see why they should command the type of P/E ratio you expect.
