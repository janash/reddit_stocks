1,IRS," When you sell shares or crypto for more than you paid for it, then those are taxable capital gains.  It makes no difference if you leave the money in your account or withdraw it.

2,CPA, Don't worry about quarterlies the first year. The IRS will give you a little buffer and won't hit you with any penalties the first year you make money outside of a wage income but after you get your taxes done your CPA/accountant should inform you that quarterly payments are a must for the next year to avoid penalties and fees.,BB_Captain,2,/r/RobinHood/comments/ojfrew/question_about_taxes_and_selling_not_sure_if_its/h526ofw/,0.047,0.924,0.029,-0.2725

4,IRS," yes, the IRS doesn't care what you do with the money you owe them. If you made untaxed income at a job and spent all of it on a car, you would still owe taxes on the money you made at work even though you put that cash into a car. If the shares you bought drop below your entry value and you sell at a loss, that is factored into your yearly realized gains (subtracted from).",rmphilli,2,/r/RobinHood/comments/ojfrew/question_about_taxes_and_selling_not_sure_if_its/h52kouz/,0.085,0.798,0.117,0.3964
5,AGI," Your gains will be reported on your 1040 and your Traditional IRA contributions will lower your taxable income. You don’t necessarily have to transfer those gains specifically, but you can make a contribution for that same amount, and it’ll net out. 

Also there are factors, like if you have an employer sponsored account and overall AGI, that will limit deductible contributions.",CajunKick,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/ojfrew/question_about_taxes_and_selling_not_sure_if_its/h52mh6q/,0.025,0.872,0.104,0.6187
6,RH," If it helps, think of your cash sitting in RH as just another bank account.

Alternatively, if you sell a stock in an Roth IRA account, it is not taxed and can stay in the money market account (cash account) until you're ready to buy another stock. That is a tax-free event.",phi186,2,/r/RobinHood/comments/ojfrew/question_about_taxes_and_selling_not_sure_if_its/h51ljnn/,0.0,0.904,0.096,0.6249
