Honestly at first I was like ‚Äúhah musk just shitposting.‚Äù But anyone who named their kid what they named their kid has a penchant for obscurity. Plus easy way to deflect any SEC nosiness, lol.

102,GME," **Short selling** is a fairly simple concept‚Äîan investor borrows a stock from a pension fund like BlackRock **(pays interest on it like a loan plus the rise in value of the stock)** or it's a naked sale, **sells** the stock on the market to a buyer (T+3 settlement), and then buys the stock back some time in the future, at the market price, to return it  to  the lender. **Short** sellers are betting that the stock they sell will drop in price. If the price rises and stays up and the terms of their agreement with the lender expires short sellers can lose a lot if they have big positions.

It looks like it's best for you to hold on if GME is 150% by hedge fund managers, as there's not enough stock to cover these positions in addition to the fact most retail investors own much or all of it. They  are still hurting dude. **STRONGER TOGETHER!**

**Hedge funds are down $19 billion with GME short positions. Hold on tight this could be the biggest market disruption yet. If you can afford it buy more.**  **Something big is happening. The Feds are getting involved. The people will be silenced no more.**

I bought at $2 on the expectation that their business can literally only improve, or they'll go under  

placed a small bet then, placed a much larger bet when they hit $5, sold enough at $22 to cover my initial investment, and now I'm just waiting for Black Widow to come out, basically  

quit trying to ride the wave on this one  

buy the dip and hold until movie theaters are back at capacity and Hollywood studios are releasing that *massive* backlog of films they haven't even put on streaming services yet  

this isn't rocket science  

if you can get in at $5, you'll *at least* double your money, I'm sure of it  

(look at their history: they're a shitty company but they don't need to get back to their five-year high of $17 or even their pre-COVID average of $12 for you to make real money off of the deal)

Netflix with old movies has a $552 a share stock where would that put AMC if they corner the market on New Movie Premieres. It's seems extremely undervalued at $7 a share right now. Take that how you will I'm no financial advisor just some guy on the internet who sees tremendous opportunity where others can only see the cloud put before them by propaganda or hype.

143,DD," Anytime you want to do some DD, Google ‚Äú(company name) SEC Filings‚Äù. [I realize this is penny stock subreddit, OTC / Penny stocks won‚Äôt have nearly the amount of information disclosed, as a warning.]

[Financials]
A lot of people get caught up in ratios and percentages and then get flustered cause it‚Äôs complex, but you can gain some really good information by just looking at the basics. Is the company‚Äôs revenue growing at a steady pace year over year? Have they consistently shown a profit with a good margin? Do they have a high amount of debt compared to assets? Do they have operating cash flow, or is all their cash coming from debt/equity?
These simple questions are really good starter questions to determine if a company is worth looking at. 

[Disclosures] 
Within financial statements are footnotes and disclosures. Much of this is lawyer language, or canned documentation with numbers inserted in, but there are some disclosures you want to pay attention to. Any disclosure about a significant client, if there is a disclosure about how 1 client makes up 70% of revenue then you‚Äôre going to want to understand how that client is doing in their business. Any disclosure about stock issuance or taking out debt, you want to understand if they have some grand plan in mind for the money that will generate future revenue or if they are trying to generate cash flow due to failing operations. Any disclosure about significant write offs they have had, is it a one time thing? Does it seem indicative of a problem at the company? And if you see a going concern clause, then either start considering shorting the stock or just close out and move on. 
Many disclosures can be made within F/S footnotes, these are just a few examples of what to look for. 

[News] 
What does the news say? Is there a big announcement of a new product line, new business venture, new partnership, new big client? Are the latest news articles about the company/stock mostly positive or negative? Does it seem like they are moving in the right direction or does it seem like things may not be going so great? 

[The Actual Stock]
And then you take all of this and you look at the stock price. If you see a good news for the company article from 3 days ago and the stock has risen 16% in those 3 days, then the good news may already be baked into the price and it‚Äôs not the optimal time to buy. Maybe you just wait and see if some people sell off to lock in gains. 
If you see the stock has made any significant movements in the past 1-3 months then make sure you understand what was behind that. 
If you see the stock is down but can‚Äôt find a reason why, then maybe it‚Äôs a good opportunity to invest. 
Volatility, price range, shares outstanding/market cap, and trade volume are all relevant things to look at when considering what is going on with a stock. 

Keep in mind, stocks are supposed to represent part ownership in the future earnings of a company. But sometimes stocks don‚Äôt always toe that line (see: GME / the last 2 weeks). Sometimes there are forces/situations that are outside a company‚Äôs operations that can affect a stock price. 

This isn‚Äôt a complete guide by far, but these are some of the things you can do to get started. It‚Äôs just important to start learning. Read through financial statements and Google everything you don‚Äôt understand until it makes sense. Look at motley fool or other similar financial sites and see what reasons they give for recommending a stock. Most importantly, DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. A lot of people lost a lot of money these past two weeks because they believed a bunch of misinformation posted on WSB and upvoted 30K times.

161,PM," I have an educational background in accounting/finance so most of the books I have read are textbooks haha. I always recommend Rule One Investing, it‚Äôs a website and podcast that provides amazing tools for people to get started in understanding how to value a company. It‚Äôs this investor Phil Town, on the podcast he is basically teaching his lawyer-daughter how to invest and therefore you are learning along. The website has spreadsheets and tools to teach you how to value a company and he has a lot of ‚Äòfollow along with me‚Äô lessons where you both go through a company and learn where/what to look at and how to do some calculations. I used it a lot when I was first getting started to really hammer home the basics.

SeekingAlpha is a great place to learn. Read through their analysis articles, pick articles that sound interesting to you or involve companies you‚Äôre interested in. If you come across terms or acronyms you don‚Äôt know, Google them. The other day I read ‚ÄúTAM‚Äù, seemed vaguely familiar, looked it up, oh yeah it‚Äôs total available market, meaning the amount of demand basically. Doing stuff like that will slowly grow your vocab and understanding of what indicators/analysis is important and what to think about. 

For books, I would just Google Best Finance / Investing books, maybe add Reddit after the search and see what the most upvoted ones are. The only barely-related book I will recommend is ‚ÄòThe Smartest Guys in the Room‚Äô, it‚Äôs by far one of my favorites. It‚Äôs about the Enron scandal and takes you through both the business and personal / social aspect of what happened. Super well written and interesting. You don‚Äôt have to have a great understanding of accounting to enjoy it, but if you do read it and want to better understand some of the accounting tactics/methods and vehicles they used, feel free to PM me and I‚Äôd be happy to break it down in more understandable terms.",Bezit,4,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ld6i26/here_come_the_gmeamc_people_looking_to_make_a/gm4lhv9/,0.009,0.833,0.158,0.9914

Counterpoint on SNDL; they suck as a company and this stock forever teeters b/w .50 and 1.25. 

I‚Äôve been in and out of $SNDL for the past 14 months. I‚Äôve made some and lost some each time, but if you do a bit of research (on the company, not the stock) it‚Äôs pretty clear that they‚Äôre poorly run, even with a new CEO, and relatively unstable going forward.

A lot of the recent DD is boasting that they‚Äôre ‚Äúdebt free‚Äù now, but that debt only existed because they fucked up so hard in 2019 that they had to enter Financial Restructuring and nearly went bankrupt.

Now you could look at their avoidance of that and their ability to pay back the debt as a sign that things are turned around, or at least headed in the right direction, but, if you look at their balance sheet, they don‚Äôt have strong or even consistent revenues, and there also isn‚Äôt any sort of indicator to lead you to believe there‚Äôs future growth (no new product or partnerships on the horizon, no market advantage over a competitor, etc).

Also, they didn‚Äôt erase their debt with profits/revenue, but rather, they did it thru asset sales (not using equipt because of covid), capital raises (diluting current investor‚Äôs shares massively), and debt equity swaps (rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic essentially).

So while a tweet about them being a ‚Äúdebt free‚Äù company looks good on paper, it ignores the fact that they were only in debt because of being a terrible a business, and are only out of debt now becuause of selling things (assets, shares, value) that are not their main product (cannabis).

>...US state legislation would cause a boom on the market, which is why I would recommend getting in ahead of the curve. 

Sundial is a Canadian company. Recreational weed is legal in Canada. Sundial does *not* operate in the US (I haven't been able to find any news in the last few months implying intention to operate in the US in any capacity- if you have news items to that end, please link them!). There are various Canadian weed companies that already have a supply chain in place in parts of the US where recreational and medicinal marijuana products are legal; to me, these companies would be the clear leaders in the sector as states legalize/the federal government decriminalizes. Therefore, I am hesitant to think US legalization would be a catalyst for Sundial.

This goes back a year and a half to around the time of their IPO, but this is still 13 years after the company was incorporated; by this point, significant scale production issues should have been ironed out.

228,ZOM," This is true. 

I have been in ZOM since 0.45 and closed when it peaked around 1.20 early on.   
I bought back in at .90 and sold yet again in the 1.10s.  
I had to use my funds to make some other plays, so I figured I had time to move things around. I was wrong.

I expected ZOM to consolidate again around 0.95-1.00, which it did for a little while, but I guess the word spread like wildfire or the hype train is here after all the recent social media frenzy about #stonks.

None-the-less, at the time of writing this, I'm a true believer in their product(s) and actually do like this stock.

Whether folks are here for a quick buck or not, this company has had great catalysts and even better ones are upcoming. As a passionate pet caretaker and owner, I do see value in their product that releases end of March.

But that's not where they're stopping. They have plans and are continuously in the process of developing additional products or supplementary tools that synergize with their ecosystem. This is the start of a newer generation of healthcare technology for your beloved pets.

How valuable professionals and veterinarian organizations find the product, only time can tell. It's just as important that there are cus

258,EMP," A great idea, but are you allowed to select which brokerage? For example Vanguard makes you manage everything yourself, but the load fees on transactions, so like you contribution and your employer's monthly match it's something tiny like 5 or 6 cents per share you purchase each month. Since my 401k, personally, is legitimately an account I don't plan on touching 'til I retire (if China/Russia/America/Proud Boys don't detonate an EMP in the atmosphere over USA and erase all the 1s and 0s that actually are our money), I put like 95% of my contributions into the S&P 500. Thought process being since 1951 when index funds were invented, the S&P500 has performed at an average of +7% annually. Inflation is +3%, so if you weather the downs and just stay in, you theoretically will beat inflation by 4% each year. And that's a way to grow your money long-term. Remember too, that's YOU managing your account. 

So now when you open a 401k with brokerage like Fidelity (and that very well may be your only option that your employer offers), when you sign the paperwork etc, in the fine print they are MAKING you agree to active management at a fee of ~5.5% of your gains. I know this specifically because when I got out of the Army, my first job had a 401K plan with Fidelity and I was pissed because it just didn't seem to be growing aside from my principal. I finally got blackpilled enough that I read all the fine print, and here's their operating model....they force you to agree to active management at 5.5% of your returns. They're not stupid, so they just throw your money in the S&P500 (which you coulda done for free). So, if you have an average year, your holdings will grow 7% (minus 3% for inflation). You've beaten inflation by 4%, but then Fidelity takes 5.5% of the 7%. SO. Where does that leave you? +7% - 5.5% - 3% = -1.5%. NEGATIVE ONE POINT FIVE PERCENT. You will loose your money when they actively manage it. They know this. They know that because of their douchebagesque terms of service, they can have YOUR cake, and eat it too. 

Now, you're not fucked if Fidelity is your only option.....you can opt out of active management. It has been a few years now, and I can't remember specifically how I did it, but I do recall seeing the opt-out clause in the fine print. I did what they said, opted out and immediately the value of my 401k started growing the way I thought the math should work. 

I'll never forget it. It was 2018 and I listened to this podcast episode and it all finally clicked: https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-thing-can-money-rebroadcast/

All of the above being said (written), YES absolutely take advantage of your company's 401k. it's legitimately free money

*edit* my math is wrong; I'm a history major. Math doesn't work the way I explained, but the concepts remain. Don't pay someone else to do what you could just as easily do yourself for free!

They're not stupid, so they just throw your money in the S&P500 (which you coulda done for free). So, if you have an average year, your holdings will grow 7% (minus 3% for inflation). You've beaten inflation by 4%, but then Fidelity takes 5.5% of the 7%. SO. Where does that leave you? +7% - 5.5% - 3% = -1.5%. NEGATIVE ONE POINT FIVE PERCENT. You will loose your money when they actively manage it. They know this. They know that because of their douchebagesque terms of service, they can have YOUR cake, and eat it too. 

Now, you're not fucked if Fidelity is your only option.....you can opt out of active management. It has been a few years now, and I can't remember specifically how I did it, but I do recall seeing the opt-out clause in the fine print. I did what they said, opted out and immediately the value of my 401k started growing the way I thought the math should work.

260,ONE," A great idea, but are you allowed to select which brokerage? For example Vanguard makes you manage everything yourself, but the load fees on transactions, so like you contribution and your employer's monthly match it's something tiny like 5 or 6 cents per share you purchase each month. Since my 401k, personally, is legitimately an account I don't plan on touching 'til I retire (if China/Russia/America/Proud Boys don't detonate an EMP in the atmosphere over USA and erase all the 1s and 0s that actually are our money), I put like 95% of my contributions into the S&P 500. Thought process being since 1951 when index funds were invented, the S&P500 has performed at an average of +7% annually. Inflation is +3%, so if you weather the downs and just stay in, you theoretically will beat inflation by 4% each year. And that's a way to grow your money long-term. Remember too, that's YOU managing your account. 

So now when you open a 401k with brokerage like Fidelity (and that very well may be your only option that your employer offers), when you sign the paperwork etc, in the fine print they are MAKING you agree to active management at a fee of ~5.5% of your gains.

Your calculation is wrong. They don't take 5.5% of your total - they take 5% of the 7% gains - what you've worked out is 7% minus 5% of your total.

As someone else has pointed out, it should be 7% - 0.385% (which is 5% of 7%).

337,RMBS," $IVR, hit hard by covid and recovering, high yield, profit and dividend increasing. Besides, it's heavily short, for those like squeeze, there's lot of juice in it.

It has issued new shares recentlly but will benefit in long term by raising capital to increase profit, this how mREIT grow and this also provide the best time to buy this mREIT at the dip with great discount price. Buying dip is the best way to win big in REIT because you enjoy the yield and also the appreciation.

$IVR is a great deal because profit is increasing and the dividend has raised 60% from $0.05 to $0.08 on Dec 2020 (follow the cash never go wrong). It is even safer now as 98% investment is in Agency RMBS. Selling on discount with huge potential. All this is my opinion, do your study.

That being said,  there hasn't been much news since August/September when they failed their second test for the hyped product. 

Maybe they will have some news about a merger or their strategic direction during their upcoming earnings call. 

Taken directly from the website:

Engaged Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.¬†to Assist in Strategic Review.¬†On September 29, 2020, the Company announced that it had engaged Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. as its financial advisor to assist in the strategic review process. Potential strategic alternatives that may be explored or evaluated as part of this review include, but are not limited to, a merger, business combination or other strategic transaction involving Acasti and/or CaPre. There is no defined timeline for completion of the review process.
Reduction in Headcount and Discontinuation of Substantially all¬†Commercial and¬†R&D Activities.¬†The Company initiated a plan in September 2020 to reduce personnel and expenses to preserve cash and further reduce its operations consistent with the decision to discontinue substantially all commercialization and research and development activities. The Company expects to devote significant time and resources to identifying and evaluating strategic alternatives, however, there can be no assurance that such activities will result in any agreements or transactions that will enhance shareholder value.
Jan D‚ÄôAlvise, Chief Executive Officer of Acasti, commented, ‚ÄúWe remain committed to maximizing value for our shareholders, and as previously disclosed, we are actively exploring and evaluating a range of strategic options. We have also taken a number of proactive steps to preserve our cash by reducing staff, discontinuing all commercialization activities and putting R&D activities on hold. This has resulted in certain one-time and non-cash charges as reflected in our financial statements this quarter. While we continue to pursue strategic alternatives, we plan to complete the full data analyses for TRILOGY as contemplated in the Statistical Analysis Plan, including the pooling of the data from TRILOGY 1 and 2. As previously disclosed, we plan to provide an update on the final TRILOGY data when feasible.‚Äù


This to me screams that the company as we know it will not be around long, either due to closing or acquisition. That doesn't mean there isn't money to be made, but I personally don't see long term value. 

If you or anyone else reading this views this differently, I am also looking to expand my knowledge and techniques for assessing and appreciate the feedback.",Cardinalsfan5545,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lcrbgg/txmd_what_are_your_thoughts/gm2r095/,0.034,0.856,0.11,0.9841

646,ATOS," I am still new and learning as well. I did notice though, if you look at the 5 year chart, you will see a very obvious pattern where it goes up and then down three times. To me, that seems like something that is being caused by the company. From my college days I remember that companies can do a stock split which will lower the price per share. That's exactly what it looks like ATOS is doing over and over again. They are splitting in order to use the money for hopefully something useful for growth and then letting investors buy up the additional shares over a time period (around a year maybe?) and then splitting again. Rinse and repeat. Personally, I am holding what I have because I'm fine with waiting to see if they in fact did split or if it will continue to rise. If it dips then I'm fine with buying up at the dip and waiting for the next rise. Anyone can feel free to correct anything I said. Like I said, I'm still new and only have a basic understanding of accounting from college to sort of help me at times. Let me tell you though, it's not much help lol. Accounting classes in college don't go very deep into investing from the point of view of the investor.

927,IMO," It depends on your risk tolerance IMO. If you're OK losing 20% or more in a couple days, then only do 4-5. If you want to minimize large swings, going with more diversity will reduce your likelihood of losing a lot in a short period of time if one stock does an offering or announces a RS or something like that. 

The other side of the coin is that if you have 200 shares in a stock that takes off, your balance goes up significantly more than if you only have 25 shares. 

Like others have said, do your own due diligence. Know the upside and downside to the company. Set a price target (which I still haven't been very good at doing) and a stop loss or exit strategy in case the trade goes against you. 

Finally, this is something I learned the hard way, is never be afraid to take profits. About a year ago when NAT pumped like no other i took my account from around $200 to around $2500 and rode that MF RIGHT BACK DOWN.  I now use the idea that if it's good enough to Screencast, it's good enough to sell. A generally sell most of my position to ensure gains but leave some for continued exposure in case it still goes up. FOMO is one hell of a thing, and it has burned me personally.

I also sometimes set multiple stop lost especially when I'm in good gain's

Like it ATOS recently I got 500 at 3.04 put first stop lost at 2.44 for all 500 shares, then the stock grow to 4.70 I sold haft(250) at 4.60 and removed my original stop lost to put another one at 4.10. hoping the stock grows and I can move up my stop lost but at the current moment I am happy how its performing and what I'll make if I sell at stop lost.

1025,AYTU," Thanks for the article btw!  It sounds like NEOS should go up in anticipation of the merger, and AYTU will take a hit initially, then rise:

  

* When one company acquires another, the stock price of the  acquiring company tends to dip temporarily, while the stock price of the  target company tends to spike.
* The acquiring company's share  price drops because it often pays a premium for the target company, or  incurs debt to finance the acquisition.
* The target company's  short-term share price tends to rise because the shareholders only agree  to the deal if the purchase price exceeds their company's current  value.
* Over the long haul, an acquisition tends to boost the acquiring company's share price.

So I suppose I'll watch and wait.",jpmoney26,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ldfiiw/understanding_a_merger/gm5t70b/,0.019,0.822,0.159,0.9412
