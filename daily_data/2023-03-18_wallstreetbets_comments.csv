0,AKA," If banks don't invest their money they lose on ""unrealized profit"". AKA opportunity cost. This is especially true in times of inflation, they would be losing money like the rest of us plebs. So they invest as much as possible, knowing that if lose they will just get bailouts.

13,VC," The biggest institution in this case SVB is #16 in the country and below $250bln, so this is nothing like what happened when all 10 of the biggest lenders were in trouble in 2009.

The issue was subprime with $1trln-$2trln, so it touched every institution in the system. Loans going bad to borrowers who should have never qualified, impacting all banks. Nothing close to this is happening today.

We’ve had aggressive expansion especially in the last 3 years and with that there’s naturally going to be some trash that needs to be taken out. The 2023 event impacts a few regional lenders, that’s not necessarily the sign of a broader systematic issue like 2009. 

It makes sense these lenders are the first to go down, they may not be the last, but they’re all related to tech, a capital intensive industry, especially when you consider newer start ups and research firms which these banks catered to. In other words, companies hoping to make money next year, or the year after that, because they’re not making money today. They don’t have to have any income and when capital costs rise these companies have issues and thus their banks also see issues.

Tech has has a boom since Covid when everyone including businesses bought softwares and various tech to work remotely and work from home and meet Covid restrictions. There should have been expectations for somewhat of a tech slowdown just because of this. 

Normally, bank runs or crashes are stemming from the loan side. There’s been a capital or liquidity crunch sure, but in the tech start up space, these kinds of companies don’t go get normal loans. They get financing from venture capital. VC has less capital to throw around, and these startups have to draw down their own cash so this is a deposit issue for the banks not a lending portfolio issue. At the end of the day these banks didn’t have enough operational cash to meet their needs.

Typically bank and financial industry meltdown exposure are fueled by loans. Loans that are sold from one institution to another, the secondary market, MBS, etc. this is not the case today so the overall exposure to the entire industry is low. 

Sure, any banks that continued to buy short term bonds in an aggressively rising rate environment would be in trouble. They’d also have to completely ignore best industry practices, ignore what rates have been doing for the last year, and have no asset liability management and insufficient portfolio and pipeline hedging. And they have $2trln “line” secured by bonds lent out at face value.  15% of that has been used (low advance rate) with 5% concentrated in SVB alone, which we know is in a liquidity tech related crunch. 

Bad for the tech industry and venture capital. Not as nightmare mode for the banks and financial companies.",UCACashFlow,38,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11ukpfj/bank_failures_20012023_inflation_adjusted/jcp0om4/,0.073,0.877,0.05,-0.763

Yup, exactly. It should cover expenses and then turn a small profit for the people running it. That's it. If that was the case, failed banks caused by bank runs would be a once in a *century+* event. Instead, this is twice in 10-15 years we're seeing massive banks fail and it's because these are publicly traded companies trying to maximize profits.

102,ALL," (20+ years as IB/portfolio manager); Excellent post and link.  I don't think I saw it in the original post but one thing that compunds the loss is the fact that a lot of those Treasuries that a private fund owns are hypothecated - they are borrowed against and leveraged.  It effectively is a mini derivative.  

I hate to say this but investors who are in these funds signed a subscription agreement that specifically spelled out ALL of the possible risks - including macroeconomic risks.  Is the Federal government going to bail me out if I own Enron and they go bust bc of criminal management?  Did the 401k accounts of Enron employees get protected in anyway?  No - all those people lost it all.  

So, here we are today.  All of these private funds are made up of corporate or Accredited investors.  Accredited investors affirm that they are effectively ""experienced"" and ""sophisticated"" investors.  I am not saying I personally don't feel bad - I am saying they knew what they were doing - or at least attested to the fact that they did.

Since these funds can all prohibit withdrawals, the investors in these funds are effectively stuck and screwed.  The SEC, which governs these funds, is NOT going to find any of these funds guilty of anything - bc the investors all signed on the dotted line.

Finally, this whole issue is but a microcosm of the bigger problem in the investment community: easy returns due to loose money policies caused investors to believe that they would always make money if they just held.  Did the investment community take advantage of easy returns and market and sell more aggressively?  Sure.  There was demand and they filled it. That's capitalism.  Look at the attached chart.  And that's just hedge funds.  The growth is absolutely incredible in the last 10 years.  

The fault, imo, is entirely on the investors.  THEY signed a document that gave complete control of their money to an advisor.  THEY attested that they were accredited.  THEY did so in the pursuit of returns better than they could get in the market.  Those who say that Blackrock et al took advantage of the investors are merely passing the blame.

There is no difference between bailing out a private bank and bailing out a private fund - bailing either out effectively guarantees against losses.  That is exactly what the government did in 08 and as a result, we are where we are today, oversimplified of course.  

At some point, people, investors need to accept that they can lose money.  I am talking the entirety of investors.  But Private Fund investors believe they are getting access to managers that are sophisticated and ""better"" than the common folk get.  Hubris.  Investors in private funds are no different than Madoff's clients: they listened to the swan song of easy returns and now that those returns are over, they want their losses recouped.  Sorry - that's called investing.

TLDR: Investors in private funds should get no help from any regulatory agency to recover losses - even if those losses are 100%.

104,OP," I guess OP will not be responding, but I do have a question if anyone else can answer it:

Let's say one of these funds is down 20%, and then someone wants to withdrawal their money... do the funds only have to pay out 80% (the current market value) or is it written in the contract that they can withdrawal the full amount of money that they contributed? 

Because if they only get the current market value, I don't really see an issue here. Ya, they lose money, and if these clients want to sell at a loss, go ahead. Yields on the long term bonds are already coming down, so the losses on the bonds are already getting reduced... but the stock market is going down again, so any stock losses are growing. But if it's just the bonds they're worried about, I'm not sure we'll see yields make a new high... we might see lower yields going forward. Not back to 2021 levels, but they might go lower than they are right now. 

But if they're able to get 100% of their money back, then the first customers who pull their money out will be fine, and the last ones to do it will get nothing. That becomes a much bigger problem as there becomes a huge incentive to get your money out first and not last.",NorthernLeaf,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11ufsaj/private_funds_will_be_the_next_massive_problem/jcp47us/,0.121,0.81,0.069,-0.9444

109,ALL," Leverage. I buy a “stable” investment for $100. I collect interest of 5%. But that’s not good enough. So I borrow against the $100 say 3:1. Now I can collect the spread between the 15% (5% x 3) I’m getting and the 2% I’m paying on each of the 3 levered assets. 
All is good. I’m making 9%. 
But then, interest rates go up and this happens: 
The original $100 that yielded 5%?  Yeah, it’s not worth $100 in a 6% world. It’s worth say $80. But your not down only $20. Your down an  additional $40 on the other two levered $100 investments. 
So your original hundred is now worth $80 minus the $40 on the second two, resulting in a market value of $40 on an original investment of $100. Ooooops. 
And, to make it worse, all of your buddies did the same dang thing. In fact, you all borrowed and loaned to one another. Last one to sell gets fired. 
That’s a simplistic example of why these private funds are in trouble. 
Now for the really scary part: it’s exactly what caused the 2008 crisis. Except it was at magnitudes of 1000x. 
That’s not the scary part. 
The scary part is ALL of those derivatives from 2008?  Which are nuclear hypothecated bullshit products. They are still on every single money centers balance sheet. 
What happens if those are forced to be priced?
The criminal part, among many, is that when Goldman et al with their new brilliant derivatives product, went to the SEC to get them approved? guess what the SEC said?
They said we don’t understand these so you guys regulate them. Total dereliction of duty. 

I can tell you that maybe one of my hundreds of former clients ever read a prospectus. Or understood what the risks were. Worse, maybe 15% of the professional I work with could explain even part of the above. It’s not that I’m so smart. It’s that most people in the biz are NOT smart - they are SALES PEOPLE who either create or sell wonderfully complex products that few understand, purposely. 
They are drug dealers in nicer suits. 
Finally, how many people do you think actually read the quarterly fund updates?  Or question anything?  Why? Bc they talk to the manager and he says everything is fine blah blah blah. 
This is what I want to change. I want people to understand and take control of their money by teaching them to ask the right questions. If you don’t understand hypothecated assets or debt coverage, I bet you CAN tell when someone is lying to you. 
Here are two simple requests you can make from any advisor:
1. How much did you make over the last 3 years?  And provide income statements. 
2. Show me your investment account and 401k statements bc you’d better own what your recommending to me. 

I’d say 1 out of 50 will provide the above. If they do provide and their investment account is LESS than yours, run away. 
See how simple that is?  You just got rid of 90% of “pros” that are out there.  If I’m going to build a house I’m not going to hire a guy who doesn’t live in a house and never has built a house but says he can build a better house then anyone has ever built, almost guaranteed.

115,VERY," No, I'm not prohibited from trading. I trade options every day.

I sometimes have the ability to read into future forecasts from these funds for the market but most of the time, it's stuff I already know. Besides, most of these funds aren't really invested in anything sophisticated. You'd surprised how many funds copy off each other making this whole thing sooo much worse lol.

So, right now, the fed is in a VERY bad situation. The memes on the front page are spot on. Do we save the banks and subsequently everyone else that is overleveraged, got greedy but are also ""too big to fail"" or do we protect consumers and keep thwarting inflation? Frankly, I think many of these banks lose perspective of what inflation could manifest into if the fed loses it's grip on it. If these greedy fucks all got bailed out and inflation sky rockets, they'll likely need another bail out within the year or 2-3 years since rates will continue to go up. So, they start new with new US treasury bonds and inflation increase by a lot pushing the timeline further for thwarting inflation. It's a lose lose situation for the banks and I think JP see's this. So, this bailout could just be a one time thing and JP telling everyone else to pound sand, welcome to capitalism. 

If banks fail on a mass scale because they all got incredibly greedy in 2020/2021, the fed bailing more banks (and now Private Funds) will just make inflation worse. So much so, that they'll likely go under again. So, capitalism forcing the hand of the fed which ultimately decimates the value of the dollar.

That said, this market is absolutely ripe for making money. It's an options traders wet dream to see this kind of volatility. Just be weary of a potential pause in fed rates. If this happens, markets will explode forward. One way or another, by the end of the year, it will be up a shit ton or down a shit ton. So I recommend a long spy straddle however, I have a feeling the fed will just start letting banks fail knowing they can get away with this without losing too much versus what they have to lose bailing them out. So, it's tough to say.

I currently have SPY puts for the end of September.",,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11ufsaj/private_funds_will_be_the_next_massive_problem/jco5l34/,0.172,0.713,0.114,-0.984

That said, I tend to agree with you. I feel like we're conflating to very different issues here. Investor redemptions may bring down some funds, but I don't see that as becoming a systemic problem.

Back stopping depositors for unlimited amounts is a bad precedent to set, But our banking system fully operates on confidence, and a total loss of confidence would be detrimental to the economy at large, much more so than some funds going bankrupt.

But god do they SAY they love the free market. You know, just not like that.

You literally have to have a vertical “monopoly”/business integration from “seed to sale” which is insane. I believe the original requirements was something like “Must be an established licensed nursery or 20 years with millions in yearly revenue.” Again, keeping out anyone but big business from making a dime of new and flourishing market of MJ.

Edit: Current requirements

“A business that has been registered in Florida for the past five years;
A valid nursery certificate of registration from Florida’s Department of Agriculture; 
The technical and technological ability to cultivate and produce marijuana, including low-THC cannabis;
The ability to secure the premises, resources, and personnel necessary to operate as an MMTC;
The ability to control all any and all cannabis products, including the raw cannabis plant parts and any byproducts;
The infrastructure to dispense marijuana to registered qualified Florida medical marijuana patients;
The financial resources to keep operations going during the two-year approval cycle; 
A medical director to supervise the MMTC’s activities; and
A diversity plan that ensures the involvement of minority- and veteran-owned businesses. “

The irony of “The technical and technological ability to cultivate and produce marijuana, including low-THC cannabis” is all the state grower complained if they were forced to cultivate less than 10% THC potency MJ they would lose a large portion of the harvest yearly because it’s not possible to be at 9.9% without going over sometimes so they would have to grow less then 5% potency weed which no one will buy/ is basically hemp. So one of the requirements is openly discussed by those already in possession of the license as impossible, but you have to be capable of doing it. Also the 5 years in business was originally greater and required being a nursery for that time period. You have to be a nursery for 5 years before you can grow weed.

269,FC," Wrong. The guaranteed result is a deep and lasting recession and the deflation that comes with it. Took so long because the new money created was mostly from QE and not a credit bubble in the classic sense so raising rates didn't have a rapid effect. 

The net result from SBV is much stricter lending standards. From banks to VCs. History is now relevant again. Just dust off the pre FC play book.

It is going to be slow because soooooooo much money was created. Even with M2 tanking at rates not seen since the gold standard, the preparation of competent CFO's ( not you Silicon Valley VC idiots) means the massive corp debt doesn't get rolled forcreal till next year onward, and ZIRP will never happen again.

Best case is a replay of 79 to 83. By far the worst economic slow down since the great depression.

Prepare yourself.

Second option is a resurgence in inflation followed by all of the above. Just later and worse.

They can do what SVB tried to do, raise $1-2b and use that to cover losses from liquidating a portion of their securities portfolio, that would be effective, but why do that at the lowest possible share price when they can just borrow that money at 5%

“Unrealized losses” means they can continue operating and generating good income as long as short term liabilities (deposits) don’t flee, that was life at $140 ticker and the day before SVB, FRC being a bank that offers an uncommonly good and personalized service to high-value clientele makes this more likely than shorts may want to admit",That-Relation-5846,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11uueya/first_republic_is_conservatively_worth_83_share/jcqgehr/,0.061,0.825,0.114,0.8201

303,FRC," The interest paid to FRC on the loans is income. Their cost of funds is way below the interest rate on the loans even after the run on the bank over the past two weeks, because of Fed and large bank intervention",kuvholt,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11ub9bq/why_first_republic_banks_stock_probably_wont/jcqjo9y/,0.0,0.87,0.13,0.7184
304,VC," >while you make some good points I agree with,  a lot of that is irrelevant when it comes to a traditional bank run.

SVB was not a traditional bank run.

The demographics of Its depositors were very concentrated - they were mostly tech and biotech startups.  And the VC firms who invested in these startups knew and were connected each other, and also banked with SVB..

Also the depositors who got investment/financing from SVB Investment division had to leave a big chunk of their funding with SVB",phileo99,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11ub9bq/why_first_republic_banks_stock_probably_wont/jcq098e/,0.014,0.922,0.064,0.6369
305,FRC," Yes. But I have looked at some of the other regional banks' numbers similar to this that are also down this week, and they didn't look as dire as FRC (no negative book value or Deposit Deficit.

306,SWAG," The accountants do and they do so at level 2 and level 3 estimates which include a lot of SWAG. Mostly cash flow estimates and PVs which would obviously decline in a rising rate environment. The FV estimate also includes holding and liquidation costs. If you see a bank with FV exceeding book be sure to let us know, we can turn them in for fraud and maybe get an SEC reward.  I hope most people who can read have the ability to discern what is happening here (crayon eaters excepted).",soffo_moric,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11ub9bq/why_first_republic_banks_stock_probably_wont/jcpdj2t/,0.04,0.842,0.118,0.7506
