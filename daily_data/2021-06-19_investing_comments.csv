3,GE," Because of the fast recovery of the market crash in 2020, I suspect that many inexperienced retail investors may think that's how all crashes work. Plus there really hasn't been a significant correction that I recall in the last 10 years. An investor really has to look much further back to at least '87 to see how trading and investing has evolved. Plus - there have been significant changes in market mechanics since the late 80's.  

I don't necessarily disagree with your overall sentiment. But I think that an informed investor should worry if their choice of investments drops in value. I agree that short-term fluctuations shouldn't be a concern. But macro issues do matter. 

I saw that you cited Enron as an example. But it's not just outright management fraud that can cause a slow decline or even a slow recovery from an initial crash. Companies like Sunbeam, Cisco, GE, Kodak, etc. can all be interesting examples and counter-arguments to why someone shouldn't ignore systemic risk.   

If a portfolio isn't risk balanced for the investors profile - they should worry. Someone in their 50's with 50% of their net-worth tied up in meme stocks probably should worry. As should someone in their 20's with a large chunk of their savings in a money market who is not seeing a raise in their net worth.",greytoc,1,/r/investing/comments/o3a1ls/three_awesome_quotes_that_will_help_you_keep_your/h2cmvzs/,0.11,0.785,0.105,-0.5034

For example, if you invested in Enron and their accounting scandal keeps getting bigger every single day. Or if you went all in on, say, Albanian stock market, and they've just ended up as the epicenter of some new bloody war.

99% of investing isn't like that, though. :P If you did your DD, and if your stock falls due to basic market fluctuations (and not because the management spent years cooking the books), that's still the same company that you'd invested in - so don't panic, stop looking at the price, and go watch a movie or go for a walk. :)",Night_Runner,1,/r/investing/comments/o3a1ls/three_awesome_quotes_that_will_help_you_keep_your/h2c1v7d/,0.126,0.791,0.083,-0.6951

Also when you get assigned you don't have to immediately turn around and sell a CC.  You can wait til the stock appreciates in price and it has a higher IV period like around earnings.

40,IMO," Keep in mind that stocks are high for a reason: the Fed has been pumping unprecedented liquidity into the economy since March 2020 (and honestly since 2008), so of course some of that money is going to make it into stocks and assets. 

It hasn't simply been a matter of irrational euphoria that got us to this point.  I'd personally say there's an element of that, but these sorts of equity prices are exactly what you'd expect when safer assets are not only yielding nothing but actually have negative yields. 

Another commented mentioned that we may trade sideways while we have a controlled Fed walk down and earnings catch up with stock prices. It's a definite possibility.  Me, I'm doubtful that it will be so smooth, because the world isn't a smooth place like that.  But it is a possibility.

IMO just looking at P/E ratios is not enough to be predicting a collapse.  That said, there are other issues we've got to worry about like ballooning debt, inflation, and what will happen if the Fed has to raise rates sooner than expected, of if we have another crisis and they have to double down on accomodative policy.  The situation is precarious either way, and we may well be headed for disaster. But it's not guaranteed. 

The way I look at it is that, if everything goes to plan, we should be just fine.  If it doesn't, however, we're in a very vulnerable situation.

As for crypto, there's no guarantee that it won't go crumbling down in a moment of panic along with the rest of the market.

45,IRS," A crash isn't necessarily a bad thing if you are bold enough to capitalize.

You are spot-on regarding the looming crash, however with the coming $6TN economic sugar pill we will certainly see new high's market highs which will exacerbate an already dyer inflation situation. 

Add to this the inflation crisis in Europe, Asia even in the little Islands and you will soon realize that we are not only heading for a period high-inflation, but rather hyper inflation because of the globalization drag. 

There are few that will come out of the next crisis on top, and I do not think wealth preservation can be successfully achieved by holding Gold. Precious metals and gems have been confiscated in the past, while the IRS already knows how much assets you own.  Because of anonymity BTC will likely be taken down. Besides the Establishment has fought 2 world wars to control the money supply, do you honestly think they will give over control to crypto? Laws are easily passed these days which changes traditions, while the sheep keep believing in fiat.  

In closing; if you plan to manually trade, there are companies that will most likely survive such as coca cola, after all, they survived 2 world wars. I plan to ride out the highs and the lows, but I am smart enough to use machine learning to do this, and I am not talking about the $500 robots that can turn you into a millionaire in 2 months.

46,IRS," A crash isn't necessarily a bad thing if you are bold enough to capitalize.  
  
You are spot-on regarding the looming crash, however with the coming six trillion economic sugar pill we will certainly see new market highs which will exacerbate an already dyer inflation situation.  
  
Add to this the inflation crisis in Europe, Asia even in the little Islands and you will soon realize that we are not only heading for a period high-inflation, but rather hyper inflation because of the globalization drag.  
  
There are few that will come out of the next crisis on top, and I do not think wealth preservation can be successfully achieved by holding Gold. Precious metals and gems have been confiscated in the past, while the IRS already knows how much assets you own. Because of anonymity BTC will likely be taken down. Besides the Establishment has fought 2 world wars to control the money supply, do you honestly think they will give over control to crypto? Laws are easily passed these days which changes traditions, while the sheep keep believing in fiat.  
  
In closing; if you plan to manually trade, there are companies that will most likely survive such as coca cola, after all, they survived 2 world wars. I plan to ride out the highs and the lows, but I am smart enough to use machine learning to do this, and I am not talking about the $500 robots that can turn you into a millionaire in 2 months. Nobody sells system that work unless you are like Citadel, and willing to pay billions.

47,AMC," I like your comment, but here is something to bounce off of you: If you could go back in time and tell yourself in mid February 2020 that the stock market was about to free fall, would you have done anything about it? Of course this is easy to say since we all now know what was to come. I am not selling everything, but I did sell almost all of my individual stocks early Monday morning. I would say the best long term hedges against the soon to come sideways market and inflation is crypto (bitcoin and cardano) and I would invest in stocks that will benefit big from the chip shortage (TSM is my pick). Also am picking cyber security stocks (NET). And lastly picking solid stocks with normal range P/E ratios (Apple). 

I used to believe in time in market beats timing market - but we are in a different stock market. A relative of mine opened his brokerage account because of Tesla skyrocketing last year. Then got in the AMC trading craze back earlier this year, and made enough money that he at his age of 33 only has to work a part time job to pay the bills because he made enough money from the Reddit stocks.

59,IMO," Why are you settling for 6-7% when mediocre index funds will get you around 10% in return?  
You need to question your financial advisor, she's being a bit conservative.

And on the other hand, IMO your investments are very risky, if I were you, I'd save some cash and wait for some Blue Chip stocks to crash, and then buy the dip. There have been 2 significant crashes in the last 18 months, and the bounce has yielded 100% gains easily, so think about that.

60,IMO," Hey there.   The other guy gave you good advice for retirement, but I don't think that saving for retirement is your primary motivation right now (although starting slowly could be a great idea!)

So, I would say that you want to be careful with whole-market ETFs since you're young and might actually need this money before retirement.  You say you don't need the money right away, but you never know once you leave your parents house and start providing for yourself.  Expenses come up.  Job security is not 100%.  And even if you don't need any of it until your 30s, 13-15 years is not a very long time horizon.  The last thing you want to see happen is a market event that wipes out 30% of your money right when you might need it.  That's the risk of whole-market ETFs.  Of course, if your time horizon is 40-50 years, no issue.  But that's not necessarily your case right now.

IMO if you want to start saving for retirement now you could put a little bit into a whole-market ETF.  The rest I would be looking at more conservative investments like high-yield savings accounts or money market funds, which suck right now but hey it's better than nothing.  You could even consider looking into bonds, but be careful because even the bond market is the Wild West right now.  Defensive stocks could be an option, too, but those are still pretty risky.

One option would be invest a portion of it and keep the rest in cash savings (in a high-yield savings account, for example).  I definitely would not go all in on investing at your age, tempting as it may be.  You'll be grateful you have at least part of that money secure as you transition into adulthood.

Just my 2 cents, I'm new to this but I'm 29 and having a backstop of savings has provided me a lot of comfort and security.",shortyafter,1,/r/investing/comments/o3btd5/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h2bp7sy/,0.036,0.816,0.148,0.9894

63,ORCL," I just don't feel your questions are the right ones. You must be an organizationalist in your day job. Someone who needs orderlinessnes, tidy, efficient. And while fine traits, none of them serve much purpose to the goal of trading.

What you want in a broker is honesty. 

When I go in Monday, not only am I going to look like a fool, he'll politely not express he thinks I'm a fool.

But depending on what the market does Monday I have to tell him I'm not a fool and knowing what I know now I'd have sold out my positions late May.

I want honesty from him. And I believe he has it ... good insight to a ton of news. And I want that.

A broker doesn't and can't to your analysis.

A broker can make sure after your analysis there isn't a piece of news you've overlooked. Like ORCL losing a government contract.

The paperwork questions is less important. Good brokerages have more but have staff to help you.

Retail brokerages have little staff.

So if you're weighing better or worse brokerages the better ones tend to be traditional.
