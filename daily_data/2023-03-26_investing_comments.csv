0,CD," I was totally in the I-Bonds camp since 2021 but not anymore. 

If you’re right and their new APY is 3.5%, that’s a lot lower than a MM fund.

Also, the rub with I-Bonds is you can’t redeem for one year after you purchase and if you redeem before 5 years, you lose the last 3 months of interest.

To me, it seems a better, more flexible deal to buy a short term CD or MM Fund. But, if you choose the Fund, check the expense ratio vs the 30 day SEC yield so you know the actual return you’re getting.",SpecificTrading,40,/r/investing/comments/122dis3/ibonds_still_a_good_buy_when_compared_to_cd_rates/jdqy4im/,0.06,0.84,0.1,0.6474

3,NYT," I think you should start getting your financial news from better places. Reuters is pretty good, Marketplace with Kai Rysdal podcast is excellent. Your big old media like NYT, WAPO, Houston Chronical are good if you stay away from the opinion column. 

Inflation absolutely is going down, and has been for six months. By the end of summer were probably going to be very near the 2% yoy target. Used car prices are stubborn but that's kind of expected with millions fewer new cars being produced during the pandemic. New rents have stayed the same the past 5 months but that data isn't showing in the CPI yet. But the end result is inflation the past few months is mostly just in our minds at this point. The data shows the big increases are a thing of the past. Doesn't mean it's over and dead, but it's heading that way.


Second, you're not understanding what's going on in the banking sector. The money printers are not on. We can argue about the definition of a bailout but these are not bailouts. They're short term loans to provide liquidity because the media whipped up a frenzy and almost caused a nation wide bank run. What happened to SVB is serious, but it's not 2008. It's something new, it was bad but because of 2008 and the ensuing tools given to the fed it didn't spiral. It's not going to cause inflation. If anything it will have the opposite effect since banks might be tightening up.

On to your question. I think short term CD's or treasuries are probably the best safe option right now. 3 and 6 month are nearly 5%.  Really it just depends how long you're okay not having your money available. I bonds are locked up for a year. If your outlook is long term then market ETF are probably smarter right now. Interest rates will probably continue to move upward until the fed is confident inflation is truly dead and gone. So getting any CD's or bonds long term is probably a bad idea",shicken684,17,/r/investing/comments/122dis3/ibonds_still_a_good_buy_when_compared_to_cd_rates/jdqt5kv/,0.084,0.806,0.11,0.802

11,FOR," You need to read the specifics. 

If you buy an I Bond right now, you get 6 months at 6.89%. Then you get 6 more months at likely 3.5% + 0.4% fixed rate. Then I'm assuming you get 6 month at maybe 2.5% + 0.4% fixed rate 

That equates to roughly 4.7% annualized during those 18 months. If you sell before 5 years, you then have to give back the last 3 months of interest as a fee. 

This effectively means you get 4.2% if you sell 18 months from now. Some CDs pay around 4.5%-5% right now

20,IMO," I agree 1% of advice cost produces +1% is a wash.  Your net is zero. 

VOO is a popular etf  at Reddit but it is certainly does not have the lowest expense. The SPY 500 lost -19% in 2022, and YTD losses is -10.65%. My most optimistic expectation is it will fall more when the fear of recession arrives in 2023. Your 40% seems to be a heavy bet.  I backtest SP500 last 10 years that catagory returned a total of +7.3% yearly avg and had +11% total return only. Most of these returns were from bull years that I do not believe will repeat with a WW3 like scenario possibly pending. 

Perhaps you ask them to put the cash in some high dividend etfs.  IMO today you can attain that +7.3% with high yield. Whenever the interest is up there are more people going to put % in safer places.  If you study the volume there are more exits than entries lately. 

For VOO or whatever, the heavy weights are FAANG that control >25.1% of the total fund, if I remove some of them and backtest last 10 years I get no worse than +7.3% w/o the volatility of tech stocks.

21,OP," I’m skeptical of direct indexing. My financial advisor quoted me 0.3% fee for parametric. Let’s say you’re OP and invest a $500k lump sum today, then over the next year the market is flat but your direct indexing manages to harvest 10% losses. Great!, that’s $50k in losses! But you either need $50k of gains to offset or it’s going to take you 17 years to recognize the tax credits.  And your tax benefit will be $3k * 35% marginal tax rate = $1k. But you’re paying 0.3% * $500k = $1.5k in fees each year. 

Then, the real issue is when you fast forward 5 years. The market is up 20%, but because you locked in a lower cost basis of $450k, you’re sitting on 33% ($150k) unrealized gains.  Going forward from there you’re unlikely to realize any more significant losses, but the shares are sitting in this high fee account.  If you withdraw the shares, then you have to manage a portfolio of 500 individual holdings. You could sell the shares to switch to an etf, but you’d have to pay taxes on the gains.

34,USA," I think you need to consider what you want to do with the money/what you need it for and have your allocation reflect that.

If you want this to be your retirement fund or generally want to grow a large nest egg, focus on the long-tem and just go with a globally diversified equity allocation: 80% developed world, 20% emerging markets (or leave out the emerging market part altogether if you prefer). 

If you want to overweight the USA in your portfolio (you specifically mentioning the S&P 500 alludes to this), you can make your allocation consist of, say, 80% developed world and 20% S&P 500. Since about 65% of the developed world allocation is USA, the aforementioned combination ups your USA allocation to ca. 72%. This deviates from the passive investing standard of using capitalization weights as your allocations, but if it's what you want it's a valid thing to do.

If you want to be safer, reduce your equity allocation and throw in some bonds: 80% equities, 20% bonds and a gliding path to more bonds as you age. The downside of euro-denominated bonds is that yields are still excruciatingly low, unlike US bonds. Perhaps you want to look at European corporate bonds as your bond allocation.

If you want to be even safer, throw in more bonds. It'll cost you potential returns but your portfolio's volatility will be lower. For a large part it's a psychological thing - can you handle market volatility and swings in your net worth?

If you want to be a bit more adventurous/put in some more effort dealing with the different funds, diversify with small cap value ETFs in addition to your large cap equities.

If you acutely need the passive income (from your description, you don't) look at REITs and dividend ETFs.

You are thinking of putting a quarter of your allocation into precious metals. I am not a fan of this at all. Traits prescribed to gold by and large stem from the performance of gold in the 70s - what isn't included in the story is that this coincided with the end of the Bretton Woods system which kept gold prices artificially low and might also have had a hand in the inflation spike of the time. Clearly when this system ended, gold prices boomed. If you exclude that period, gold has a pretty poor track record. Commodities in general don't provide lasting returns - they act as short-term inflation hedges. Really ask yourself what you want to achieve with your precious metal allocation and consider if you can't achieve this in a portfolio-friendlier way (lower fees, higher return potential) using a mix of equities and bonds.

It seems like you - as many newbies do - want to overcomplicate investing to convince yourself you are doing the necessary due dilligence and putting in the work to avoid mistakes. This is understandable. The simple truth is that fewer funds, a simpler strategy, a focus on the long-term and continuously cost averaging are the magical ingredients to growing wealth.

43,USA," > I watched a video where BRICS are going to dedollarize the us, and to buy gold.

You're watching conspiracy theorists.  You should not follow their advice on the fact they told you to buy gold alone.  Gold is worthless, you need real assets. 

BRICS was coined in like 2008 and for the most part it's been a flop.  The only big growth story there was China.  In the next decade it'll likely be India. 

Russia - look at them.  Look at their war in Ukraine.  They're fucking pathetic.

South Africa?  Not very impressive.

China - same deal - housing crash, COVID overreaction, lagging economy, and an eternal risk the same thing that happened to Russian investments a year ago happens to yours when they invade Taiwan.

Brazil - Growth story there is not impressive at all.  Maybe you ride the bump on export costs because Brazil competes with Russia in a lot of categories?

India - again, this is the only one I'd be willing to put money into if you want big growth. 

The USA has some really really big advantages on the global stage that drive its growth, and those advantages seem to be on the trend *upwards* despite what people will tell you.   

The dollar isn't going away anytime soon either.  There are many qualifications for a global currency like the USD.  Liquidity, openness, willingness to run a deficit, **political independence of the central bank**.  Literally nobody meets the qualifications the USA does, and the Russia/China duo are far and away not likely to meet those qualifications anytime soon.

Don't buy the narrative of conspiracy theorists.  Unless you have some great solid knowledge - and if you're watching these videos you fucking don't - stick to decent, safe, **diverse** investments.

51,USA," I've had the pleasure of living and working in India and China for the better part of the last decade. (In Civil engineering projects and development in conjunction with some of their top universities)

There are massive systemic road blocks to either nation becoming top dog,  or even close to that. Some of which have improved slightly,  others which have come to the forefront,  and others still which have gotten worse. 

From my point of view there is zero chance in the next 2 decades India will make any major gains on the states. There will be more manufacturing moved there,  and then it will probably be moved elsewhere once the reality sets in.  I'm sure India will rise up the ranks,  mostly due to population,  but nothing that will challenge Europe or America. 

China,  15 years ago,  I'd laugh at the thought,  7 years ago I'd entertain the notion they could possibly do it with a very lucky set of circumstances and perfect policy maneuvers,  but they went the wrong way and it's going to be impossible for them to reverse course as long as the present leadership is in charge. So it's pretty easy to write them off for another 10-15. And then it'll take even longer to right the ship if they ever get the chance/ choose to do so. 

It's going to take a lot more than a bunch of citizens and manufacturing to overtake the USA.",roox911,1,/r/investing/comments/1225b44/emerging_markets_a_good_time_to_invest_or_no/jdqkr6s/,0.034,0.817,0.15,0.9834
52,ALK," I am sure there is money to be made if you can pick the right airline , I mean just look at ALK stock price over the last 20 years.

But to me I don't know enough about the industry to weight what makes a good airline vs bad and the entire industry suffers these issues

1. High capital costs, they must buy or lease airplanes what are expensive and require lots of maintenance and be replaced or rebuilt every several years.
2. Lots of external forces , oil prices can affect them . Yes they can hedge but higher oil prices will eventually lead to higher costs. 
3. Cyclical , when the economy turns cutting leisure trips  is one of the first things people do to save money. Even business will cut down and maybe even more so now with virtual meeting tools (zoom, teams, ect) . Having lived through 2008 I can remember being surprised how much business travel the company I worked for did, people where flying everywhere weekly , hell they would fly half way across the country to attend a single 3-4 hour meeting then fly back. When the 2008 GFC hit I can remember them basically saying only 100% needed travel would be approved . 

Most of my holds are long term holds, I want to buy and sort of forget about it for 10 years. Hopefully buy a good well managed company and not worry about the market for 10 years. Airlines seem not to be like that, you sort of have to know when to get in and out.
