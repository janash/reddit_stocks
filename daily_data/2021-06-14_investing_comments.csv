0,GME," I actively test this hypothesis on a regular basis. My 401k is invested in about as Bogleheaded a manner as possible. However, I have a bit of money in an active Etrade account. 

I am not a terrible stock-picker. However, I am quite bad at understanding when to buy/sell a given company. Let me give you some examples. 

After a lot of research, I was quite into Renewable Energy Group (REGI). I bought some shares on June 10th, 2020 for about $31. The market crashed the following day, and I got nervous and sold out. By February 2021, however, the stock nearly hit $120. Around the same time I was into Canadian Solar (CSIQ), Palatin Technologies (PTN), Airbus at $15.31, and so on. In all cases I sold - sometimes at a loss - even though most of those companies have doubled, tripled, or quadrupled since then. And for all my careful research, I can easily cancel out gains with terrible choices (I thought Cyberpunk 2077 was going to be big like the Fallout games for sure... thanks Elon Musk for helping me get out of that one). 

I also made dumb decisions around options (partly to try to understand how they work). I bought a put on Tupperware on May 18th at $2.71. I had been looking at Tupperware's bonds and it seemed impossible for the company to survive. Well, the Tupperware recovery peaked at around $38, obviously the put died. I also bought puts on GME near the peak of the first short squeeze in January. It turns out I didn't account for how important the role of the volatility premium was in the price of the options. Obviously GME fell, but it didn't fall as much as I'd expected - and not enough for my OTM puts to print. I have had a few successes with options too, but they haven't compensated for the losses.

Thanks to an incredible bull market, I managed to be positive despite my terrible instincts. However, my 10% return pales in comparison to the passively managed index funds that comprise 95% of my investments - all of which required no effort, zero management, and no stress.",radagast_the_owned,12,/r/investing/comments/nz9dxc/is_bogles_style_passive_investing_really_better/h1p2q7k/,0.071,0.821,0.108,0.8696
1,DD," So one thing to remember about the 1%; their goals may be totally different than yours. So the ""average"" investor is saving for retirement, they have a job and stash away money for the purpose of having enough when they retire. Their long term goals are pretty much to retire with enough money so they can live comfortably . So yes their goal is basically to make as much money as possible; as safe as possible.  They also do not have a ton of extra money where they can waste it or gamble with it.  Very rich people are not really worried if they will be able to afford food in retirement (they will) they have already made their fortune so their goal may not be the best return possible, they may be more concerned with wealth preservation. They are already rich, they just want to stay rich . Also a huge amount of their wealth may be tied up in one asset (their business) . Jeff Bezos simply cannot sell all amazon stock and then index, doing so he would lose control of his company . So when 70% of your wealth is tied up in one asset, and you cannot sell that because you are still involved your investment strategy needs to be different.

Back to regular people ; if everyone just picked stock yes a lot of people would beat the market , however a whole lot of people would not beat the market and end up with out enough money to retire and be in a very bad situation .

So I think the safest way to make very good long term gains is the simple 3 fund portfolio of low cost index funds. It requires no complex strategy, no timing the markets and hitting moving targets, no in depth DD , its simple, it works very well and it has a long track record of providing very very good returns.

So its like if the average person had a couple choice

1. Gamble there is a small chance you will make massive returns and end up very rich, but there is also a very good chance it will go wrong and you will end up poor in retirment
2. An almost guaranteed strategy that is easy to implement that has provided very good returns for the last 90 years, you may not end up filthy rich but you are not going to be in the poor house

2 is almost always the better answer . Now my advice is this

For your retirement focus on maxing out your IRA/HSA/401k. You should be able to save 25k single, 50k per year married in retirement accounts, in those accounts invest in low cost index funds if possible

If you do this for 35-40 years you should retire with a good nest egg and you shouldn't be poor and you should be able to retire in comfort, if you have more to invest; go ahead gamble try to beat the market if you fail you still have a health retirement nest egg to fall back on",SirGlass,40,/r/investing/comments/nz9dxc/is_bogles_style_passive_investing_really_better/h1oop3t/,0.07,0.784,0.146,0.988

3,CL," If you don't want to do a ton of specific company research you can also look into sector specific ETFs via the SPDRs:

XLK = Technology

XLV = HealthCare


XLC = Communication


XOP = Oil/Gas. I would also consider this a futures proxy for /CL, Crude Oil Futures Contract.

9,DD," I only have a few years in the market so I'm not qualified to say what happens in the long term, but so far I've noticed a few key points that might give a retail investor an edge if they chose to pick their own stocks:

\- Knowledge of a specific market or company  
\- Ability to adjust strategy and not measuring P/L every quarter or 18 months  
\- Better DD if that's something you enjoy doing as a hobby

I like picking stocks, but I also have a few index funds in my portfolio, nobody says I can't do both! When I feel the index is a better buy this month, I'll put a little more into it, if not, I might concentrate on a single stock whose price has lagged recently.

I'll often buy an index and then a few additional shares of my favourite companies, or options, and try to trade around the momentum on the individual stocks while just buying the index regularly.

But I like this, it's a hobby that I enjoy spending time and energy on, and I can now easily stomach major swings in price because I have a strategy/reason for owning each stock.

There is no doubt that it's risky though.",pete_tong,2,/r/investing/comments/nz9dxc/is_bogles_style_passive_investing_really_better/h1pz7q0/,0.051,0.791,0.158,0.9765
10,ABC," I gave up on stock picking due to my employers.  I have worked for 2 publicly traded companies and the reality of the business was rarely reflected in the stock price.  In addition listening to the investor calls was both eye opening and depressing.  Occasionally there would be an analyst who would ask the right questions, but when I would look them up they were always working for companies that were discrete and did not have little people for clients.  

Even if you are right and company ABC is worth more than its current stock price it simply does not matter.  The institutions are what determine the stock price and they seem to move like a big, stupid herd.  

That said, I do believe that there are managers who can beat the market on a risk adjusted basis over the long term.  But they don't deal with retail clients, they don't go on CNBC and they certainly are not wasting their time writing newsletters.

So all I can do is ride with the herd.",D74248,2,/r/investing/comments/nz9dxc/is_bogles_style_passive_investing_really_better/h1qqe2s/,0.057,0.879,0.064,0.3455
11,APR," The key to winning in poker is it's not about the hands you win. It's about the hands you fold. Retail investing is this to an extreme. 

MOST stocks trail their index. About .02% of stocks make up 10% of returns and about 20% make up all of the return. At least in poker you can go in blind, make a bluff, and take a small pot. Try that in the market and odds are you lose money 4/5 times. 

These patterns necessitate indexing. Now one can actively trade indices and there is likely profit to be had there for not a ton of time of invested knowledge. But for the vast majority of people, especially the wealthy whose time is more valuable, passively indexing wins out.

But for the 0.02%, there are some benefits towards other plays. Be it taking tax advantages (structuring things as capital gains vs income tax, using a 1031 exchange for real estate, asset protection ie homestead protection ie why West Palm Beach has so many billionaires), hedge funding to reduce volatility (in a costly and underperforming the market way) though this may make sense if you're borrowing assets against collateral where you want to minimize volatility, etc. 

But even then. You're better off with passive investing +/- diversifying into real estate with a homestead protection, +/- diversifying into real estate with a 1031, +/- coming up with some weird LLC with a weird charter/rules and copious deductions and will still likely want to passively invest the profits, +/- a small proportion in a hedge fund. I'd argue the hedge fund is stupid as they historically underperform the market, take 2% as fees, and if you can't smooth out volatility enough to make up for a 2% difference in APR, I can't help you.",Infamous-Brain2972,3,/r/investing/comments/nz9dxc/is_bogles_style_passive_investing_really_better/h1oyuo7/,0.074,0.771,0.154,0.9797
12,DD," I can't answer you question in the general but I can tell you that I observe my gains against two different benchmarks that would be passive options and I beat them over time. I can also tell you that I do not manage 500 million or 2 billion or more. 



If you invest in what you know and do DD before buying you can find buying opportunities when the general trend is a selloff. You can figure out when there is a dip or the rally after earnings is far too large far too fast so you can take some profit, or it dips despite a great long term outlook because the quarter appears bad by some metrics but the long term strategy shows that the quarter was about restructuring or changing the business in some way that will pay off next quarter or after that.


The point is that I can do research at almost any time. I can watch the market regularly every day on the stocks I am interested in, and I can also take time off whenever I need to. I don't owe anyone my time like for real estate or a small business.

I also do believe that small alpha exists that isn't economically worthwhile for large active institutions to pursue due to liquidity issues. Retail could take advantage of this, but the amount of due diligence to eek out that marginal alpha may not be worth their time either - given it's at the expense of energy spent on the rest of life and career, which arguably has a bigger impact on the trajectory of an individual's life. If you're sizing your overweightings after your DD appropriately and not just going all-in all the time, your long-term outperformance over the broad market will likely be minimal at the expense of improved wages.

That being said, outside of stock picking, I think by knowing yourself (as opposed to knowing the market), you can benefit from self-management by picking an allocation tailor-fit to your risk capacity and financial goals.

Assuming all the risks you take are compensated, you could achieve better long-term returns by taking the most risk you can afford, over just taking the market risk which works for most people, but may not necessarily be what's best for you.

Costs me money, yes, but the returns more than make up for it. So.. I don't know, been close to a year now, I'm happy with what I see. Their DD makes sense, but who the hell am I to know if it's good?

22,MSCI," I believe, that it is possible to beat the market by using factor investing. ETFs for the more well-known factors already exist, so you can still continue to invest passively.

23,IMO," It's all relative to the timing. Can you outperform passive investing in the short run? Usually, yes. Active investing typically involves taking on a higher degree of risk because your position is more informed. However, the problem the similar to gambling; the longer you play, to more you risk making a big mistake/loss, or simply missing out on healthy/steady growth your money could have been making if placed elsewhere.

IMO, the only difference between active investing and gambling is that with active investing, the degree of the ""house"" edge is not obvious.",jaydean20,1,/r/investing/comments/nz9dxc/is_bogles_style_passive_investing_really_better/h1pwswz/,0.086,0.747,0.167,0.8176
24,REAL,"  Most people don't beat the market. You might get the survivorship bias, or the bull run bias, but that's all. And if you don't believe people can get lucky time over time, read some statistics. There is 0.1% that does really good for a very long time, like years, but then after that goes to the mean.

 ETF's are great because, do you really have the knowledge to do REAL DD? Or hours to do so and learn. 

I do pick my own stocks, and have never bought a ETF, but my government through banks have a 3:1.5 match pre-tax and that's free money and enough for my pension.

 I also know accounting, and how to redo it for financial analysis. I also know economics, corporate finance and how to value a company. I know portfolio management and have a strict plan that I follow (and investing philosophy) to not Yolo my money into $AMC. Also learning for a CFA. 

All that takes time to learn. To see if you are a good stock picker you need to experience a bull run, a bear market, a bubble, crashes, economic troubles, inflation, 20+ years of investing, iron lid market, rising 10Y yield.... Only then you compare yourself to the best of the best in that timeframe and can tell that you are actually good. I don't know yet how lucky I am, but time will tell.

 I also barely have time for any other hobbies , friends, dates and so on. So pick wisely, because you can't half ass it. If you chose to go that way, you have to go all the way.

29,LUMN," I've found I've had best luck with a balance of passive and active investing. I start with a portfolio of index funds based on factor investing(mostly chasing value premium),  and devote a small percentage of my portfolio to at most a few individual stocks where I'm confident they are undervalued.

I've had a lot of luck with this strategy so far. What I've learned from my early mistakes is:

1. Don't own anything unless you have a very good reason for owning it. If your reason is ""their dividend is good"", ""their business is booming"", or ""they seem like a sustainable business"", just stick with index funds. You need a compelling reason the market is not valuing them fairly, something that isn't priced in. When I bought SLV, it was because I knew it was a temporary liquidity crunch and that fed actions would drive inflation fears. When I bought LUMN, it was because I took a deep look into their financials and determined they were undervalued. When I bought Western Digital & Seagate, it was because I saw the potential for Chia to boost their earnings.

2. Buy as if you can't sell for 5 years. It's possible that after you buy, the price starts dropping and doesn't recover. If that happens, will you be comfortable holding it? If the answer is no, then either don't buy, or keep it to a very small position.

3. Don't buy a ton individual stocks to ""diversify"". 1 stock you are confident in accounting for 5% of your portfolio and a broad market index like VTI for the remaining 95% is safer than 40 manually picked stocks each representing 2.5%.",skilliard7,1,/r/investing/comments/nz9dxc/is_bogles_style_passive_investing_really_better/h1qh3bt/,0.033,0.805,0.162,0.9879

I don't think I'm that 1% either. I also don't think I could continue to consistently beat the market. I was hoarding cash since fall of 2017. 0 trades in 2018, 0 trades in 2019, and 0 trades in 2020 until the market crashed. I think I would have mostly underperformed the S&P500 in that time? But I was focusing on business and saving up money. Put most of the credit on my outperformance to preparation, knowing how to be opportunistic, and a certain amount of luck. Will say that I probably beat the market in 2020 and currently beating the market for 2021 and but had dips where I underperform the S&P500. The reason why I beat the market was because I'm more bullish than the general market was.

I think it's less the picks but picks PLUS other factors like timing, leveraging, and other things that allow for beating the S&P500. 

>so I'm wondering if trying to build these advantages and taking advantage of any market inefficiencies is worth it.

Problem isn't the picks so much as the additional and perpetual homework that is necessary to keep on top of the SPY/VOO assuming you chose that route. It's less ""picking winners"" so much as ""picking winners, constantly doing additional homework on them, and managing readjustments to de-risk and rotating to other outperformers in a portfolio of numerous and growing assets to assure that you outperform the S&P 500"".

Also outperforming the S&P500 isn't some unimaginably hard thing to do:

1. Buy VOO. Sell far OTM covered calls and puts to supplement your VOO. If you don't get exercised or can hold out the exercised puts then YOU HAVE BEATEN THE S&P 500.

2. Buy VOO. Leverage 10-20% margin on 1-4% interest and hold for the long run. Assuming the S&P500 continues to generate a bit above 7% returns and you continue to hold until it does YOU HAVE BEATEN THE S&P 500.

3. Buy 80% VOO. Buy 1 or 2 stocks you have high conviction on and just research those. If say GOOG and/or AMZN outperform then YOU HAVE BEATEN THE S&P 500.

4. Buy 80% VOO. 20% of a leveraged S&P500 like the SPXL. If the S&P500 goes up enough to offset the SPXL costs then YOU HAVE BEATEN THE S&P 500.

So back to the original point. It's not so hard to pick winners so much as picking winners that will remain winners 1m, 1y, 5y, or 10-30yrs down the line. Also it's not so much that picking can't beat the S&P500, but doing so consistently and myriad of alternatives YOU could do to easily beat the S&P500.

36,MCD," Depends on the person.  What I hate is people constantly quoting Buffett or Bogle to a lesser degree as if their vague/general slogans apply to everyone all of the time.  Their advice as well as the ""you can't time the market"" as well as the ""lump sum investing is best"" are all skewed and based on historic data.  You probably don't have a 40 year timeline.  The data used in those studies may not include a tech bubble, fed money printing, or money making stocks going up 50-60X in 30 years.  For example, MCD was a popular money making household name in the 80s and 90s but was priced between $3 and $15 in those decades.  I highly doubt we're going to see more 1200%+ gains on household names by 2050.  So why would I then use historic data when that happened to make current investing decisions?

Their advice also assumes people suck at picking individual stocks.  And maybe some do.  But some don't.  Some follow predictable patterns and then buy when it's down.  It's not rocket science .

I think that Diy risk parity is the age of steel. You can match the growth of a bogleheads 3 fund with less drawdown and better sharpe etc. no leverage required. It’s just a different way to view asset allocation which is slightly more nuanced than the bogleheads 3 fund.

52,GDP," Yeah, retail investors obsess too much over the benchmark. The SP500 over the last 12 years has been one of the greatest bull markets at 14-15% annualized. Just look at the crazy Vanguard numbers for 1, 3, 5, and 10 year performances: [https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/performance/vfiax](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/performance/vfiax). How many retail investors got extremely rich? If you can't do it in a 15% annualized environment, it's not a returns problem.

There is a very good chance we will never see returns like that again in our lifetime, given that real GDP growth over the last 12 years has been really low. If we are only going to get 5-6% annualized going forward, and a superstar active investor can beat it by 4% and get 9-10%, it's still very disappointing compared to the previous 12 years.

The problem is not investment returns, it is the ability to earn and save money, and to be able to set aside capital for long term investment. And I'm not talking about a house fund or a college fund that you will completely empty in a few years down the road, because future gains won't mean anything after you empty the accounts. Some people can get extremely wealthy with 6% returns. Others can have 15% returns and never get rich. Most people need to get their career and financial habits in order before thinking about investment returns. Rather than wasting time analyzing stocks, they need to work on themselves.",alisonstone,57,/r/investing/comments/nz9dxc/is_bogles_style_passive_investing_really_better/h1p7s65/,0.072,0.779,0.149,0.9678

Sure, someone down 20% right now could beat the S&P eventually, but there’s probably like a 99% chance that they won’t. 

And if you invested in SPY in 2008 I think that you’d be in neither the 99% or the 1% because you would be investing in an ETF that tracks the market, so you’d actually be the benchmark against which the 99% and the 1% are being compared.",Splooshkat,1,/r/investing/comments/nz9dxc/is_bogles_style_passive_investing_really_better/h1qpync/,0.026,0.89,0.085,0.7727

Disagree with this. The difficulty is not so much in picking a company that will successful in the future, but somehow getting in there before it's reflected in the price. If you're going to beat the market in terms of returns, it's not enough to pick a winning company if the price has already ran up.

My first gambles had me up 150k from shorting hard in 3x leveraged short-finance ETFs ahead of and during the 2008 crash. Problem is, I kept shorting. Lost it all.

117,VERY," > Seems odd that all of us poor people on reddit are saying that Hedge Funds are bad and they rarely beat the SPY anyway

That's like saying ""Your sports car is lousy because it only seats four people.  My van is the best car because it seats nine.""

Hedge funds can have lots of different goals besides beating the SPY.  For example, a fund might be designed to have moderate gains, but if the market tanks (2008, 2001, etc.) then the hedge fund will only lose 10% instead of 40%.

> seems like a lot of people downplay the fact that you give a fund money, they take a cut and they make you money BUT if this is how the ""rich"" handle their investments why shouldnt the poor people do it also?

Maybe.  Current regulations 'protect non-rich consumers from potentially risky, or merely unregulated, investment products'.  If you don't think that people should be protected, I can't disagree.

> I'm assuming the ""rich"" are a lot more okay with only making 5% a year when that 5% is coming from a portfolio of $10 Million....for the lazy, its $500,000 a year or one VERY expensive Lambo

118,DE," There are at least three relevant metrics here.

1. Absolute return. A lot of hedge funds, especially those top ones (RenTec, Citadel, DE Shaw…), beat the market (in terms of the absolute return) by a large margin. 

2. Correlation with market return. Most hedge funds provide returns that have no market exposure (and a lot of other risk factors too). In this way they can be used to diversify your portfolio.

3. Risk adjusted return or Sharpe ratio. Hedge funds care about Sharpe ratio probably more than the absolute return because ideally you can always keep leveraging your portfolio (not considering the market capacity/impact). The limiting factor is really the downside risk, which can be partially quantified by the Sharpe ratio. While some hedge fund might not make as much as S&P in terms of the absolute return, the performance might be much more consistent (for example, they never lose money on a single week), which is more desirable to risk-averse investors.",andrew_shen,1,/r/investing/comments/nzr17w/if_hedge_funds_really_do_such_a_bad_job_why_do/h1rfrr6/,0.063,0.862,0.075,0.4855

123,VC," Exactly this 10000%. Let's say a long/short hedge fund has an excellent track record of 5% per year **real** returns after inflation adjusted. Let's say rain, sun, or snow, bull market or bear market, their investing strategy is so close to a guarantee of 5% per year.

Clearly they are not beating VTI which on average produces 7% real returns per year. However, the fund is going to have way less drawdown risk and way less volatility. 

If you're seeking financial independence (/r/financialindependence/) then you may have a goal of retiring early. People often cite the 4% safe withdrawal rule, but if your portfolio is 100% VTI then it's more like 3%. Under the 4% rule you could have a dollar after a 30 year retirement and it still be considered a success. 

Let's say my retirement goals is $100k of inflation adjusted dollars each year. If I do it by myself in VTI with the 3% SWR rule it's going to take $3.3 million to safely withdraw it.

With the hedge fund I could very well withdraw that 5% every year thanks due to their returns regardless of market conditions and lower volatility/drawdown. In order to have the same income I only need $2 million in the hedge fund.

I'd be able to be retired 1.65x faster by moving my money to the hedgefund when I want to retire!

137,GME," Most of the narrative around hedge funds shorting certain stocks are probably not accurate. And much has been based on a single hedge fund that did have a heavy short position in one stock which may have been in itself a hedge.

A lot of the noise centers on short interest data which could also be made up of retail investors and swing traders. The way that short interest and short volume data works - it is a snapshot of what's occurred and it could very easily simply be day and swing traders capturing fast price movements or overnight short positions.

\[edit\] - also - this is pure speculation on my part but I bet that few people in the industry (at least those who are regulators and examiners) will come to the defense of the hedge fund that was shorting GME. Many of those people who have ties to SAC Capital back in the 90's are heavily despised for the insider trading fraud.

I think SolarEdge and EnPhase are probably going to continue to reliably drive revenue growth and margin expansion, but not at the levels we seen from 2017-2020.

The highly speculative, pre-revenue plays are going to be interesting to watch. These companies need cheap capital to invest in R&D. Many of them will see stock prices fall, as interest rates rise. We seen it earlier this year when the 10 year rallied. 

The debate over Tesla - well, that is its own conversation in itself. Tesla is, IMO, a bubble that will burst. There was a FOMO with Tesla. Everyone piled in to it. All the best performing funds and ETF’s in 2020 were heavily exposed to Tesla. Tesla is priced to perfection, with growth expectations that Tesla is unwilling to hit. IMO, Tesla won’t hit the growth expectations due to....
- underfunding of key programs (e.g. EV charging infrastructure, vehicle manufacturing & quality controls, solar roof tiles, service departments)
- competition from other EV companies & models
- Aging models (the Tesla body style that the Y,X,S,3 have is now 11-12 year old look/appearance. Is Tesla the next Porsche - where buyers lineup even as models styling has changed very little?)
- The “fruits” of acquisitions in the past will be lackluster (e.g. solar roof tiles. A complete failure. The acquisition of SolarCity will be seen as a bailout for SolarCity and Elon Musk)

Tesla has accomplished a ton, but for Tesla to get to the next level of growth, they need to double down and reinvest in many parts of the business. At its core, Tesla’s core competency and competitive advantage is their battery manufacturing and their technology (battery management system + autopilot). Other parts of the business are, IMO, more of a liability than an asset. That is what Musk needs to fix. Instead, Musk focuses too much effort/time (IMO) on crypto, and crypto’s role at Tesla.

143,TSLA," Will add that buying an ETF also means you're paying management fees and buying into smaller new companies that could either succeed or fail. 

For example: take the IWM which tracks the Russ 2K. No one buys it thinking *""Man I fucking love [gaming retailer that can't be mentioned on r/investing] or [movie theater chain that also can't be mentioned on r/investing]""*. Yet those were the companies you also buy into when they were eating shit for years. Also what is pulling it up right now. The IWM has 2042 holdings. At equal distribution each should have around 0.05% of the ETF's value. However, right now those 2 combined make up 1% of IWM's entire AUM value.

If you want diversification then that is what you're buying into with a smaller ETFs like that. There is merit in diversifying away from a TSLA where it's market value is now tied to it's portfolio of [digital currency that can't be mentioned]. 

Will note how [Warren mentioned (1:33:00) an interesting note about buying a net basket of innovators.](https://youtu.be/gx-OzwHpM9k?t=5581).

147,NX," 2021 is bringing some decent competition, but to your point, nothing quite at the price point necessary to give a wider swath of consumers the feeling of affordability.

With federal EV tax credit - ID4, and Kona EV are quite affordable. (compared to $58,000 Ford Explorers and $40,000 Subaru's). But not going to hit that sub-25k price point. Bolt EUV is probably the cheapest out-the-door ""normal car"", and the appearance is updated to have broader appeal. Not sure if the Bolt EUV will convince enough people. But the Bolt EUV might be the closest thing to a $25k Camry/Accord.

Rivian looks to be a serious competitor, but we're really working with a lot of rumors/speculation at this point. If Rivian can live up to the hype, I think Tesla is in trouble. Rivians look great, and their vehicles are different enough to not overlap with a Model X or Cybertruck. Rivian looks new, has a ""addictive"" look like a Tesla (or Porsche). If Rivian can hit it off; a Tesla will seem like a car from a different decade next to the Rivian (because it literally is), and this is going to really hurt the momentum Tesla has in with middle-upper middle income Americans.

Competing over the same customer, we'll see Porsche and Audi bring more expensive options. 

Ford and Hyundai are doing a lot of interesting things, but nothing quite at the $25k price point. I guess what is really missing in the EV market is *that* $25k good looking 4 door sedan/crossover. I am not sure if this will ever come (in America); Americans really like these crossover/SUV styles. And I can see why so many manufacturers have some sort of crossover/SUV/dont-call-it-a-stationwagon offering. The average vehicle price for many ""legacy"" mainstream crossover/SUV/dont-call-it-a-stationwagon (Explorer, Forester, etc) is totally in that $30-50k price range now. Then to bring a sub-30k offering to the market; brands keep making crappy new models (Lexus NX is a great example, but 37k. It is a terrible vehicle. Yet Lexus makes it because affordability. Benz CLA is another good example. But other cheap examples being Ford Ecosport (a lifted Ford Festiva?), Chevy Trax, etc).

&#x200B;

It is definitely a weird (and probably frustrating) auto market for buyers at the moment (affordability problem). Speaking of affordability......is Tesla ever going to release that...what was it, $25k or 30k Model 3?

It's a combination of the MACD and the DMI. They seem to act like a leading indicator when you compare it with the change in price.  


For instance if a bearish signal hooks into a bullish signal but the price continues down even against bullish indicators it's a false hook. Things like that.  


Watching meme stocks really seems to help test signals because their volatility is so high it is like watching everything in fast motion.  


And since backtesting is significantly likely to be biased based on when you pick your starting point - observing real time and prediction seems to be a better way to digest signals-data.

212,AGFY," VOO is an easy index fund you can throw money in to sort of set and forget. It's the top 500 US companies, so it's fairly stable over the long term.

Look up the Dividend Aristocrats and throw some money into a few you like. They give stable dividends (mostly, ATT is doing some weirdness at the end of the year), so you'll get some relatively reliable money in exchange for lowered growth potential.

Keep a little money around to play with random stocks to learn how stuff works. You might end up with a big winner or huge losers, so don't overextend yourself here. I'm feeling good about AGFY right now, which sells products to support agriculture. I expect it will double this year, but it's still a risk so I've only put a measly $70 in it.

I think people should have some degree of their portfolio in things that benefit from inflation and rising rates. Do I know what these names will do tomorrow or next week? No idea. If I felt like I had to time/trade around every Powell speech I'd probably just cause unnecessary stress more than anything. If someone's daytrading, great. If not, I just think people should have a longer-term view and get used to volatility - something being 5% off the high wouldn't really get much notice from me.

I mean, I own SE and that was about 33% off the high at one point earlier this year and has since bounced.  Not fun, but have a long-term view on it, have a cost basis that's quite a bit lower. Happens. Has bounced almost entirely back since. Own great companies, buy them aggressively early on and/or during times like March 2020 and just own them. Eventually, your cost basis is well enough lower that a 10-20 or even 30% correction is not fun but it's not ultimately that big of a deal. Have the fundamentals changed? Is there a better idea? If no, then just continue to own it. 

Lets say I bought at the high. That would have been substantially not fun - it's a matter of psychology; buying at the top and being down 33% feels a lot different than owning it for a while and from much lower levels and having it correct 33% off the top. The latter is a lot easier to tolerate than the former and if you have a long-term view on something and have a lower cost basis, that psychology IMO is helpful when there's corrections or more substantial pullbacks.

Buy great companies, if there's a correction buy some more, if there's a March 2020 really be more aggressive buying. If things get excessive, take a little of the table (not so much that you get FOMO if you're wrong) and wait for a better opportunity to re-deploy.

Current budget is $800 a month to go toward investing starting now. This does not include my 401k which is receiving a similar amount between my contributions and employer match.

Time horizon is most realistically within the next 5 years (vehicle purchase, moving, etc).

Risk tolerance is low/medium. Effectively looking for a higher interest savings account. I have zero desire to try to ""beat the market"". 

No depts other than our current mortgage which we're paying down extra principal on as well.

Both 401k and investment account are with Fidelity, if that matters.

268,FANG," I'm sure that there will be rumblings of antitrust for a while and it will probably take a while for anything to actually happen if it does. If it does, there's scenarios where parts and pieces are broken up and imo could wind up unlocking value as investors run to own parts of larger companies that they could never could separately before. 

But, I dunno: I tend to have an opinion that so much of this sort of thing revolving around ""government doing something"" is noise and political theater. How many times have there been discussions about lowering healthcare costs and fixing healthcare? Quite a few over the last decade and every single one of those has been a buying opportunity for healthcare stocks. Infrastructure? I've heard a lot about that for years, too. This whole thing of tech antitrust is theater of ""look at us going after the villainous corporations!"" Will they ultimately?

270,HUGE," I'll shortly explain my reasoning: TQQQ being a 3x ETF can be modeled through a simple differential equation which shows that its returns over long time are three times the logaritmic returns QQQ divided by a factor which depends on daily volatily: the higher the daily volatility the higher it is, the worse it gets. So for long term returns' sake it does not really matter if qqq has dipped itself, but market crashes usually bring higher volatility and that's where the problem lies. The thing is, you need a HUGE volatility in respect to gains to actually perform worse than QQQ, and this did not even happen with covid crash. So either there is a gargantuan crash with crazy high volatility or TQQQ wins (whether dot com bubble actually was so bad to do what I said i do not know, I am only saying that maybe even that was not enough do destroy TQQQ)

I hope i explained myself, what about spy? Do you agree that qqq is better?",Victorgab,2,/r/investing/comments/nzhki5/give_me_reasons_to_choose_spy_over_qqq/h1plnpn/,0.15,0.697,0.152,0.3404
271,NOW," I live in Vietnam. Use Grab every day for food delivery about 3-4 times a week for Grab bike/car/shipping stuff. Prices have been creeping up the last few years but still so cheap & convenient. Lots of competition here though including Now (SEA Group), Baemin, Bee, Gojek & a few smaller ones that have popped up lately, but Grab still seems to be the most popular (followed by Now). Grab bought out Uber in VN a few years ago as I recall.

There is also Grab pay but as far as I know hardly anyone uses it at as there are like 100 alternatives (Airpay (SEA Group), Zalopay, VN pay, Momo, Wepay... ). Personally I wouldn't invest in Grab as the market is so saturated. Although they get a lot of money from me I can't imagine their margins are great as 99% of the time its significantly cheaper for me to order Grab food than go to the restaurant myself.

274,AMZN," Use the Expected Value formula to discount these stocks against the possibility of going to zero due to some event such as fraud, govt regulatory risk, or ADR ownership shenanigans.

P(normal) = 0.90

EV = P(normal) \* Current Value + P(go to zero) \* 0

EV = 0.9 \* Current Value + 0.1 \* 0

By this logic, you should basically discount the value of Chinese stocks by whatever % chance you think they have of going to zero.

I know people in this thread will all love to play up these risks, but my own assessment is that they are a low probability of actually happening. Now compare BABA at 25 PE to AMZN at 60 PE and tell me the market giving it more than a 50% discount to AMZN is appropriate. I'd hardly say so.

282,QQQX," A bear market is unquestionably drawing nearer with every passing day. The easy retort is that one is always on the horizon, of course, but in this case we will almost certainly see some sort of sharp correction by September or earlier, and most likely before August.

There is no magic fund that will protect you perfectly from a crash; there are just hedging strategies, and everything costs money. That is, to stay invested for growth in this shaky market you will have to spend some of your earnings on hedges if you're careful, or lose the gains when the correction/crash comes (and likely much more). 

If you're investing for a very long time horizon, you could invest as you normally would, avoiding clearly overbought stocks and funds, while keeping some cash aside as dry powder. Staying in the market isn't either-or. 

Two types of securities that tend to do well in depressed and sideways markets are REITs and buy-write funds; an example of the latter is QQQX. Make sure you understand tax implications of buy-write funds if held outside a tax-advantaged retirement account. In terms of REITs, pick best of breed ones with strong balance sheets known for weathering downturns; WPC is a prominent example. Strong REITs do well in depressed markets because they can add to their property portfolios at a discount, plus the depressed share prices keep dividend yields high--the longer the better, actually!

284,ATH," Because they go up & down unpredictably. Silver had its ATH in the 80s i believe, what sense does that make?  I always say Speculators invest in news, investors invest in numbers. Commodities are very news based. Some bomb going off in a desert somewhere sends the prices of oils up?  It’s not sound & predicable. It creates a ‘get it on it’ or ‘ride this wave’ mentality. I just believe commodities are not for the average investor. 

Gold I somewhat understand the reason behind it. If you brought gold from 1500s Europe to 1500s Asia, 2 groups of people that never traded before, you can trade. They both accept it. It has inherent value. (Nobody is buying an engagement ring made of plastic). Humans have always wanted gold until the US pegged gold to the dollar & people got used to the paper for convenience. People still Think the dollar is backed by gold. 

Commodity investing is just not for me. 

An oil co making more or less $ for the same quantity of same quality product because of the year it happens to be in.

286,IP," Absolutely. But to me as an investor this still isn’t a sound reason for investing. I prefer to invest in the underlying asset for the asset itself, not for what others are doing. Although others appetite drives up a stock price, the stocks cash on hand or IP can increase. The commodity is just a commodity.

For context, this is the highest tier of Nasdaq and two tiers above MARA/RIOT who have 4-5x the marketcap. Management did a great job positioning themselves financially for this uplisting (even in spite of BTC's pullback).

Bitfarms is the middle tier, one above the current Nasdaq miners.
