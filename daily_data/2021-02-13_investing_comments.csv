1,RH," This is actually headlining the news in Norway today, i.e. RH locking people out of their accounts, refusing to settle up and no customer service to talk to, and a bunch of lawsuits pending. And that says something, cause it's not your average news story here. 

What I don't get is how they can do this and not get fined, sued and go bankrupt. Locking people out of their trading, investing and money wireing, is basically disabling the very fundamental of the business they participate in. And this isn't some insignificant thing either. Money fraud and theft is a bit more serious than some average company denying service to it's customer.

I had a scenario to start this week that might be relevant. cuz I'm new to this too and I also just made a RH account because convenience, easy to use app etc. Now I started off by like...just fucking around and buying random shit. ""$20 each into dollar general, coca-cola, and gopro! why? because idk what I'm doing!""

so this past Monday I said okay let's be serious, I've done some research, let's sell all the BS and the fractional shares and let's re-allocate that capital to open some real serious positions. robinhood gave me the buying power to do so right away once I closed those positions, but advised me that I had a negative account balance, *because those trades still had to be settled*. I received confirmations right away, but all those buy/sell orders still have to go through their clearing house.

28,RH," Im going to go out in a limb here and say that they had an issue with people withdrawing unsettled funds or somehow getting into trouble with the like. 

It takes time for your trades to reconcile between the firm and the clearinghouse to be “real” again and it works this way with every brokerage. Each time you sell a stock for a gain and see your purchasing power go up, it’s not actually in the account yet. RH has fronted you the gains until the trade is reconciled to become “settled funds.” 

You guys might not like what I’m going to say, but it needs to be said. Many of you need to read, learn, and play around with an extremely small account before you try to make substantial investments. So many of you have no business trying to make substantial investments with your current understanding of simple mechanics like this.

83,GME," Maybe you can help me out. I have Schwab and hate it, mostly because I can't find my per-share cost basis.  On every screen the cost basis is in total dollars and not price per share, so if I'm wanting to see what my break-even cost is per share I need to divide this number by my total shares.

The other frustrating thing is that order status for non-filled orders vanishes after a day.  I put it an order for some GME puts last week which didn't fill.  Two days later the GME balloon deflated and I wanted to go back to that order to see what that position would have looked like if it _had_ filled (I missed the fill by 0.10), but there's no way to retrieve that history.

The other thing I'd like is a 'quick trade' link.  I was migrated to Schwab from Optionsxpress, and on the positions screen there I had a 'Trade' link that would move me to the trade screen and pre-populate the symbol, total number of shares, and trade type (If I owned shares it would set the order as sell, if I had options it would set the order as Sell to Close).  It also showed me my per-share cost basis so that I could quickly see what my position looked like.  Schwab makes to do all of this manually, and God forbid I don't record my total $ position before moving to the trade screen so I can calculate my per-share cost basis, because that info isn't there, which means I need to navigate back to the home screen to figure out my basis.

Basically I'm looking for ways to get Schwab to work this way, specifically per share cost basis and quick trade, or to find a broker that has these options.",shady_mcgee,5,/r/investing/comments/lisah9/robinhood_doesnt_allow_me_to_take_money_out_of/gn7me58/,0.055,0.871,0.074,0.7032

88,UI," Every UI I've encountered with Fidelity so far has been confusing garbage. Including their Active Trader Pro desktop app. I can eventually figure out how to do things but it is painstaking. 

I also accidentally opened multiple Roth accounts because they weren't letting me fund with my linked bank account and the accounts I was creating weren't appearing in my list of accounts so I thought there was some error creating it.

Turns out you have to link your bank account separately for each Fidelity account, but that is completely unclear during the ""fund your account"" step of account creation. 

So now I have a bunch of random accounts, including some mysterious IRA that already existed when I signed up for a brokerage account. I've tried closing the accounts in the virtual assistant, and get confirmation, but weeks later the accounts are still there. Waited on hold for hours before I gave up by phone. For now I've ""hid"" the accounts but it would be nice if they would actually close them someday. 

Putting in a trade order is tedious. I do all my research elsewhere, then just use their web UI to enter all the order info. Hopefully I never need to exit a position quickly!

If someone at Fidelity reads this: you need to hire some engineers that work with modern tech stacks. I think you all are solid, but need that sleek UI.

105,RH," If you still show $1000 of Instant Deposit, that may be it. Your cash is the collateral that gets you the Instant Deposit. Here’s what I think is happening:

>You made an initial deposit (I guess $1000)

>Whether you used the Instant money or not, it’s there by default because all RH accounts are margin accounts to start 

>You’re now trying to remove the collateral, which would leave your account with free Instant Deposit money but no cash to back it

You need to disable margin. Activate Gold (Account>Settings>Robinhood Gold) and deactivate margin. Your Instant should reduce to zero. You can then deactivate gold (which I’ll admit took me 20 attempts but you get 30 days of trial) and you’ve got a cash account with no Instant holding you up.

152,ALL," > But there is zero chance we see mini reactors in the near future. The current regulations make nuclear plants so expensive and time-consuming to engineer and operate, it's not even funny. Mini reactors would disadvantage nuclear even more by making scaling on costs worse.

I'm going to respectfully disagree with you. There are several companies in the late stages of designing SMRs(small modular reactors) and it solves a lot of problems that larger 1000MW+ plants have to deal with. These companies consist of GE Hitachi, Nuscale, and Rolls Royce and other smaller companies.

- Scalability and streamlining designs. One of the biggest fuck ups the US nuclear industry put on themselves was not having a standardized design per company. EVERY plant is wildly different, Westinghouse(who built most PWR's in the states) has so much variability in their designs that it's hard to streamline construction and implement efficient logistics and processes during construction. GE was better about this with their BWR designs, but it's still not standardized. France did it right by standardizing many of there plants through government intervention. SMR's have the benefit of being built in a factory so the designs and systems will be identical. Economies of scale will pay dividends on these plants.

- Smaller reactors means less emergency core cooling robustness and residual heat removal. A huge burden of full scale plants is having safeguards to respond in case of LOCA's(loss of coolant accidents) or loss of off site power. Even when the plant is shutdown , you gotta constantly cool the core with recirculated flow or things start to heat up and melt. This includes expensive upkeep of 2+ massive emergency diesel generators(per unit), redundant trains of residual heat removal systems, and high pressure injection systems. The greatest benefit of SMRs is the fact they are air cool able after 72 hours of shutdown. I can't overstate how important this is; if you lose power in an SMR, the stored water on site will be able to cool off the plant for the first three days(through natural recirc!), from there, the reaction will decay to the point that air can cool if off. It will be walk away safe.

- Smaller exclusion zones. To the public, this will be huge. Right now, NRC regulations require very thorough emergency procedures for the area within 50 miles of a NPP. This will be reduced to 10(and that is overkill) for SMRs. 

- None of the SMR's are 'new' designs. They are just streamlined, proven designs of the larger plants. There is nothing fundamentally novel about any of 'em(at least, the ones close to being finished). The GE hitachi SMR is just a compact ESBWR(Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor), which has already been scrutinized by the NRC and has passed initial licensing. Truly novel, new designs have to go through a litany of research and testing by the regulatory agency to get the 'go ahead,' but SMRs are still traditional plants.

No leap needed, it's here with Lithium ion batteries, hydrogen, and other developing battery/storage technology. And it's at price parity. With the passages of FERC order 841 and 2222 it will be even more economical, as the assets can also be used to bid into markets. The most important takeaway is that resolving GHG with reapect to energy generation is not a technology problem, it's an economics problem. And the answer is easy, it's increased incentives for solar/wind/storage and investment in soft cost reduction, or even better just implement a national carbon market or cap and trade and let the market decide.

>Nuclear is also not particularly dispatchable. Even with nuke baseload you need flexibility. That comes from peakers and storage.

Of course. The ideal mix I think is what we have come fairly close to in Ontario - a nuclear/hydro/wind mix. Nuclear for base, hydroelectric with a storage component to give flexibility, and wind to reduce the total amount of hydro that needs to be built. The difference IMO is between that and people who think we can achieve a 90% wind/solar grid

“In 1990, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) ranked the failure of the emergency electricity generators and subsequent failure of the cooling systems of plants in seismically very active regions one of the most likely risks. The Japanese Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) cited this report in 2004. According to Jun Tateno, a former NISA scientist, TEPCO did not react to these warnings and did not respond with any measures.[36]

Filmmaker Adam Curtis mentioned the risks of the type of boiling water reactors cooling systems such as those in Fukushima I,[37] and claimed the risks were known since 1971[38] in a series of documentaries in the BBC in 1992 and advised that PWR type reactors should have been used.

Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) operated the station and was warned their seawall was insufficient to withstand a powerful tsunami, but did not increase the seawall height in response. TEPCO ran other stations (such as the Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant) closer to the epicenter of the earthquake which had much more robust seawalls.”

175,EV," This isn't a valuation, it's fan fiction and why it's hard to get traction with bearish arguments against the company.  No one has cared in the last year, you can point to the fact that ex-reg credit tailwind their margins haven't really materialized on their manufacturing operations and that they've continually had to cut prices to move higher sales volumes which sustains this trend.  China, which accounts for pretty much the entirety of Tesla's 2020 growth and most of the projected growth this year isn't buying into Tesla's FSD promises and has a terrible take rate on the only piece of high margin software they actually gain any money off of.  Competition in Europe has seriously dented sales and it's looking like Berlin isn't going to be as heavily subsidized or get any of their next generation battery manufacturing for at least two years (assuming they actually get the permitting done and can economically produce the batteries in the first place).

Most of the positive potential developments have happened in the US with the S+X refresh at Fremont hopefully increasing volumes of higher margin vehicles out of that plant.  There's some chance they might get another sizable sales subsidy in the US if Democrats get everything on their wishlist and reauthorize another $7k tax credit for another 400k units for the company but the same bill has been reintroduced and failed several times over the last few years and there's not much of an appetite to subsidize rich and upper middle class people to buy luxury cars either.

Tesla also isn't going to be the sole supplier for the EV industry either, they already aren't for their own vehicles.  Panasonic makes the cells in Nevada and was shipping some from Japan for the S+X in the past.  CATL and LG supply cells for Shanghai and Tesla's access to the market there is literally predicated on them using local suppliers.  Batteries are ultimately a commodity product too and not something that anyone would expect strong margins on or to be particularly quick to roll out.

EV charging also isn't a particularly lucrative line of business as electricity prices are cheap and most early adopters charge at home.  The only time you see a ton of use is during big travel holidays and there's a huge need to over build capacity to meet that surge while it earns a small fraction of that income 95% of the time.

Solar is probably an even worse industry historically as companies frequently lose money and rarely make it while Chinese firms periodically dump excess supply on the market and run companies out of business.

I mean you're faulting people for not offering good criticism on the company when it's been around for years here and your entire thesis is basically, what if Tesla develops some fantastically profitable line of business that they don't currently possess down the line.  Even then that's pretty much priced in as the company is basically a robotaxi fleet punt at this point and analysts are just slapping numbers on potential business lines to try to justify the current stock price (see Adam Jonas valuing Tesla's insurance business at $40B and non-existent SaaS business at anything above $0).  I mean congrats to the longs really is all I can say we've gotten to the point where people are willing to spend billions of dollars on products and business lines that don't even exist here.

There's some chance they might get another sizable sales subsidy in the US if Democrats get everything on their wishlist and reauthorize another $7k tax credit for another 400k units for the company but the same bill has been reintroduced and failed several times over the last few years and there's not much of an appetite to subsidize rich and upper middle class people to buy luxury cars either.

Tesla also isn't going to be the sole supplier for the EV industry either, they already aren't for their own vehicles.  Panasonic makes the cells in Nevada and was shipping some from Japan for the S+X in the past.  CATL and LG supply cells for Shanghai and Tesla's access to the market there is literally predicated on them using local suppliers.  Batteries are ultimately a commodity product too and not something that anyone would expect strong margins on or to be particularly quick to roll out.

EV charging also isn't a particularly lucrative line of business as electricity prices are cheap and most early adopters charge at home.  The only time you see a ton of use is during big travel holidays and there's a huge need to over build capacity to meet that surge while it earns a small fraction of that income 95% of the time.

Solar is probably an even worse industry historically as companies frequently lose money and rarely make it while Chinese firms periodically dump excess supply on the market and run companies out of business.

I mean you're faulting people for not offering good criticism on the company when it's been around for years here and your entire thesis is basically, what if Tesla develops some fantastically profitable line of business that they don't currently possess down the line.  Even then that's pretty much priced in as the company is basically a robotaxi fleet punt at this point and analysts are just slapping numbers on potential business lines to try to justify the current stock price (see Adam Jonas valuing Tesla's insurance business at $40B and non-existent SaaS business at anything above $0).  I mean congrats to the longs really is all I can say we've gotten to the point where people are willing to spend billions of dollars on products and business lines that don't even exist here.

Will this meme ever die? They sell cars. Everything else people pitch them as  selling is just speculation or a business you'd 100% expect a 21st century car company to be in. You think Toyota isn't working on battery tech? You think GM isn't working on self-driving? You think Fiat doesn't provide software for vehicles? Yet, would you call these companies anything other than a car companies? Everything else with Tesla is a glorified side-hustle.

Oh, their an energy company? Ok... so, where's their big move into this space? What justifies the price? How much US energy infrastructure is built atop Tesla tech? What's been planned, and what's been executed, and what's the competition? All these questions just get a big shrug and a ""well, they make batteries"". On that note:

\> Where are they going to get the batteries? How are their customers going to charge them?

\> The answer: Tesla.

\> Musk has made it clear from the beginning that their intent is to supply batteries for the entire EV *industry*

&#x200B;

I think this sums up one angle the Tesla hype in a nutshell. It's the weird assumption Tesla has a monopoly on this and that, and always will. They don't, they never have, and they never will. It's like valuating an ice-cream company based on the total consumption of ice-cream in the world. If batteries are a profitable business, you're going to get a lot more people entering the space. They are already competitors rising up. In the next 10 years, most batteries in the world are not going to be Tesla, why would they be? As you pointed out, #5 now, during a time when they got a 10 year head start.

&#x200B;

And even if they do end up being the sole seller of battery tech to the car industry (which, is really not going to happen), it still doesn't justify the price. How can you be valuated higher than, what is it now? The top 10 automakers combined, when your end goal is to sell those top 10 a few components each year? It just seems weird to me. No automaker worth their salt is going to let some component manufacturer have a ridiculous profit margin on anything they build. They'll just go elsewhere.

&#x200B;

The thing is, I do think Tesla can be big. I think it has the potential to be very big. But I don't think that means it's going to be the biggest company in the world over the next 10 years which is pretty much what the current valuation would suggestion.

Amazon didn't reach TSLAs market cap until their profitability was higher than TSLAs current Revenue, and Amazon has a MUCH larger addressable market. Energy is a utility market, the margins are regulated.

TSLA is valued as if they've already won these markets, that don't even really exist, and that they are already extremely profitable in them. They haven't, and they aren't.

Is there a story that COULD justify their valuation. Yes. Is it likely, no. Doesn't mean it couldn't happen, but you're betting on an unlikely future outcome.",arlsol,2,/r/investing/comments/ling8b/why_cathie_wood_might_be_right_and_why_tsla_is/gn7t3qu/,0.05,0.787,0.163,0.8768

197,TSLA," It's tough to use reddit to discuss if a stock is fairly valued because the users that own the stock will upvote a bullish post and downvote a bearish post - and vice versa. A post making it to hot does not mean that the OP is correct, just that reddit agrees with them.

In truth, nobody knows for sure what the ""fair value"" is for a company that (1) had less than $10B in revenue last year, (2) has a market cap of ~$800B, and (3) has the potential to become the world's largest company.

204,IBM," Lithium is *not* necessarily the most successful battery technology in 5 years. There are other promising designs that do not involve Li. So, it might be possible that all of those investments turn out to be worthless. 

Cloud computing might become a lot smaller again in the future. AWS is what IBM was. Running in the cloud is just running on a more unstable mainframe. (Yes, AWS is not so perfect as the marketing tells you.) There are technology cycles. People find it difficult to run their systems on multiple clouds with good security, but there is demand for that. Kubernetes is a pathetic attempt at doing that. Other solutions are likely to emerge and at some point those might become dominant, because nobody likes to be dependent on any particular vendor.

Non GAAP profit was 2.4 billion
GAAP profit was 721 million. 

Really if you look at that, the GAAP being under a billion just tells you that they spent a lot of money. It's plenty profitable, it's just using that to grow instead of paying us a dividend. 

And I paid 10k for FSD, it definitely sells software. Keep looking at the powerwall / solar roof combo because the autobidder, like FSD, would make me money. That would also be software. 

They also installed over a gigawatt of grid storage for utilities in Q4, so they do sell batteries as well. 

Their energy margins are shit though,  which is interesting. Nobody ever asks them about those, or why their factories don't have solar on the roof.

What evidence is there that main stream consumers (those who buy a $25k civic, not a $50k lexus) are going to buy into subscription models on a vehicle? This is not likely to be a major revenue stream anytime soon, the market is going to take a long time to adjust to this model, if it ever evem gets there.

Every OEM could increase profit substantially if they halted investment, high recurring investment is a part of the automotive industry driven by consumer demand for ever evolving features and styling. It doesn't matter how much growth Tesla invests in if they can't manufacture vehicles profitably; if they can't do it today its just going to get harder as more competition comes online.

305,TSLA," I'm not sure I agree. The point of ARK is to get in early on emerging tech, which is currently manifested in the 5 sectors or so with K being the catchall(ish).

They should in theory pivot to entirely new sectors and not stay stuck in TSLA and whatever else is responsible for the 2020 performance.

That being said, what I think will happen is that they'll grow too big for their own good and they will struggle to execute.

332,EV," I am looking at how to pick up on the commodities upswing and this is what I have done and am trying to do:

I have kept around 10% of my portfolio invested in gold through an etf that is backed up by physical gold. This allocation served me as a defensive asset mostly to hedge against markets corrections. It worked fairly well even if it was a bit unnecessary as I am young and my investment horizon is the very long term. However gold price went up when markets volatily spiked for several reasons (Trump win, brexit, first covid wave). So if I had to raise cash, I guess that gold would have made sense for this risk hedge purpose.

Now I have reduced the allocation to gold to fund a position in a broad commodities index (BBG ex agriculture). I have picked up an ETF that uses synthetic replication with swaps. I get an exposure to various metals and energy (oil, gas etc).

In aggregate the individual gold position plus the broad commodities one make up slightly less than 10% of my portfolio, and I feel it's still a bit too much.

My next play is to allocate to the EV and battery sector, with two ETFs that track EVs makers and the battery value chain. Unfortunately I can't allocate to US based ETFs due to my location (I am European and my broker doesn't allow me to invest in ETFs that don't publish factsheet in my native language) otherwise I would have picked LIT.

To conclude, I have heard that with the economy getting out of the lockdown, the energy sector will perform pretty well for various reasons. So my goal is to get this commodity exposure through equities but with a long term view by balancing the exposure towards the green energy sector as well.

I like Altria (MO) and believe in them long term as a major Weed player and for the tobacco moat they have formed through regulation and time. If weed is legalized on the federal level they own a 45% stake in CRON with the option to buy the remaining 55% and are the only ones in the US who will be able to pump out 4 billion joints to every gas station, supermarket, retailer in the USA in green Marlboro packs. The little guys do not have the money or the power to fight with Altria. The regulations and laws will make it easier for MO to dominate and for the government to worry about just regulating the few corporate giants like with cigarettes. They also have a new heat not burn product they are rolling out in test markets. Check it out it is called the IQOS 3, it is classified as a reduced risk product by the FDA and they plan to use the same device IMO for people to smoke joints with reduced risk. The acquisition of Juul will pay off long term celebrities love it look at Sophie Richie, Bella Hadid with hers or Hailey Baldwin.

348,CBD," To me, if MJ is legalized throughout the US and Canada, it will become a ""crop"" (i.e., corn, soybean, hemp) with some large and many small players and a fragment distribution system (dispensaries). Now there are many small players that will go under or consolidate. This [article](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/11/27/toke-lahoma-cannabis-market-oklahoma-red-state-weed-legalization-437782) really opened my eyes on this market fragmentation with many independent growers and retailers.

In the short term, you can profit with some of the growers; however in my opinion, t*he real market are the suppliers to the growers (regulatory compliance, inventory control, pest management (like natural products from MBII) , etc.) and the derivative market (beverages, edibles, topicals (like the CBD plays), and pharmaceutical actives) - hopefully the ETFs will cover these markets to afford maximum exposure.*",stickman07738,2,/r/investing/comments/lj0qo6/im_thinking_about_getting_some_hexo_shares/gn7y3pl/,0.0,0.936,0.064,0.7964

354,III," short answer: it depends

medium answer:

you are most likely not going to find a serious answer from keyboard experts on reddit.

take for example my exchange with u/[enginerd03](https://www.reddit.com/user/enginerd03/) who claims to be a quant, given how much time he/she spends on reddit i highly doubt they are an actual PM. We had an exchange where they claimed that dollar liquidity is infinite in practice and given how preposterous a comment that is, proceeded to weasel their way out of actually explaining how it is infinite (which would get you laughed out of any room full of professionals)

If you are looking to better understand some 'trading' related issues a forum like wilmott.com (quant website) will offer information that is orders of magnitude higher in quality. You can lurk but cannot join since you need to actually work in the field to join (this keeps out the riff raff).

if you are looking for 'investment' advice ill just say just buy the US stock index , forget about it and go live your life, you will be much happier and likely come out ahead instead of trying to stock pick/time the market.

if you are more so looking to understand 'money' and 'the fed'/'banking' there is literature out there that explains how convoluted it is, youll have to do your own research but heres some help  to get started:

take for example my exchange with u/[enginerd03](https://www.reddit.com/user/enginerd03/) who claims to be a quant, given how much time he/she spends on reddit i highly doubt they are an actual PM. We had an exchange where they claimed that dollar liquidity is infinite in practice and given how preposterous a comment that is, proceeded to weasel their way out of actually explaining how it is infinite (which would get you laughed out of any room full of professionals)

If you are looking to better understand some 'trading' related issues a forum like wilmott.com (quant website) will offer information that is orders of magnitude higher in quality. You can lurk but cannot join since you need to actually work in the field to join (this keeps out the riff raff).

if you are looking for 'investment' advice ill just say just buy the US stock index , forget about it and go live your life, you will be much happier and likely come out ahead instead of trying to stock pick/time the market.

if you are more so looking to understand 'money' and 'the fed'/'banking' there is literature out there that explains how convoluted it is, youll have to do your own research but heres some help  to get started:

359,CEO," >Are these actual assets that they acquire, or just some made up number in a computer?

Most transactions are carried electronically nowadays, but yes, these are actual assets that they own. As a matter of fact, the Federal Reserve publishes its balance sheet every week. [Here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/current/h41.htm) is its most current release. For the week ended February 10th, 2021, the Federal Reserve had $7.442T in total assets and $7.403T in total liabilities (see chart 5 for breakdown). The net difference is capital contributed by member banks. The assets are mostly composed of US Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities. There are a few miscellaneous items like PPP loans, swaps, and foreign currency assets but they are less than 2.5% of total assets.

Reserves and physical currency are liabilities of the Federal Reserve but Treasury Notes are liabilities of the US Department of Treasury. It is the US Department of Treasury, via the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, that physically prints the currency in the US. The Federal Reserve can hold Treasury Securities until maturity (see chart 2) and the US Department of Treasury will be required to pay them just like they would with any other holder of US Treasury bonds.

The mortgage-backed securities are all guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, and their insurers. Should they declare bankruptcy and not be able to pay the Federal Reserve, the Fed has first dibs on any assets before any other creditor or shareholder. By law, Fannie, Freddie, and Ginnie must pay their current obligations to the Federal Reserve before buying back any stock or issuing any dividends to any shareholder (including the US Department of Treasury who is the largest shareholder via its Conservatorship program).

The US Department of Treasury keeps its own separate account within the Federal Reserve to settle their obligations with the central bank.

>Bitcoin was a very apt example, since ""reserves"" sound a whole lot like if I were to invent a new alt-coin this weekend and just claim it now has monetary value.

Yes, I understand this feeling but I am afraid it is very misguided. People often hear ""The Fed is printing money!! This is the end of fiat currencies!!"" And they don't really understand the intricacies of what really is happening. All of the liabilities of the Federal Reserve are backed by actual assets. They can just walk across the street and demand the  US Treasury to meet their obligations. 

>Some very respectable people have detailed out a stance that the fed is quite literally ""printing money"" such as Ron Paul - a United States congressman and medical doctor, and Peter Schiff - A respected CEO and hedge fund owner.

I feel like these people have exploited people's irrational fears, angst, and mistrust of public institutions for their own benefit. The Federal Reserve does publish its [annual Financial Statements. ](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/audited-annual-financial-statements.htm). And guess what...they are actually audited by an external CPA!! As a matter of fact, they are required to change auditors every couple of years.

361,CPA," >So you don't think that low interest rates are pushing investors out of debt markets and into equities? This in turn raising asset prices?

Not quite. [For the 12 months ended December 31, 2020](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/icieqbnd.pdf), US equity Mutual Funds and ETFs had net OUTflows of $253.9 Billion dollars (Chart 1 on Figure 2, Page 2). During the same period, bond mutual funds and ETFs had INflows of $555 Billion dollars. If anything, during 2020, Americans sold equities and purchased bonds...by a lot. From January 6th, 2020 to December 31st, 2020, the S&P500 increased from 3,217 points to 3,764 points; a net increase of around 14.5%. This contradicts your supposition about investors pushing asset prices up.


It is important to remember where asset prices, particularly equities, derive their valuations from. The current price of an asset is nothing more than the addition of all the expected future cash flows discounted to the present at some rate. When the discount rate (usually the risk-free rate) decreases, the net present value of an asset increases. Ceteris paribus, when the expectation of future cash-flows improves, the current asset price will also increase. 


Mind you, it is not as simple to state that since A=B, and B=C, that therefore A must always equal C. It is possible for interest rates to decrease and asset prices move downward or vice-versa. There are other phenomena that may be able to explain why asset prices have increased; besides low interest rates.


>And you don't think that low interest rates have caused the existence of zombie firms, that are basically just hanging on due to cheap money being available?

Not at all. A bank, any bank, will always issue a loan which it believes it will be profitable. If a bank believes that a loan will not be profitable, or the borrower will not be able to pay, then naturally they will not extend the credit. Corporate-issued bonds will adjust their yields accordingly to take into account that a specific firm is not likely to pay back their obligations. In other words, if a company is truly a Zombie firm, the market will adjust accordingly and they will go out of business sooner rather than later.


Japan is the country that has had the longest experience with low interest rates and QE for a long time. [During 2018, 59% of publicly-listed firms were debt-free.](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-trends/59-of-Japan-corporations-are-essentially-debt-free). This is not your standard definition of Zombie firms. They literally have no debt whatsoever, and yet they struggle to grow and beat American corporations. These companies will never go bankrupt because if you don't owe anybody anything, do you really ever go bankrupt? By the way, unlike the US, interest rates on Japan are negative. 

>Do you not believe that at some point the rise in asset prices combines with the real weakness of underlying companies, real estate, etc. is going to force central banks to raise rates? (here I am referring to political concerns and social unrest, due to the creation of a permanent underclass of wage slaves).

For the last decade or so, it has been widely accepted within academia, that the Federal Reserve does not [control long-term interest rates.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JAKHb5dom9E). Newer research is starting to suggest that the Federal Reserve does not even [control short-term interest rates](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2124039) and that the effects of QE and negative interest rates are greatly exaggerated. If anything, they have had no effect whatsoever. There are some theories out there but nobody has been able to empirically demonstrate yet why.

Interest rates are largely determined by the free market. Specifically, demand for loans and funds. Interest rates were already low before March 2020, without interventions from central banks. Put simply, interest rates are low because there is too much saving and not enough borrowing. 

I am a Tax CPA and I mostly work with banks and other financial institutions. Class warfare and apocalyptic scenarios is not really my forte so I really can't provide additional insight here.

362,UK," Hi, looking for some advice as I am extremely new to stocks, ISA’s pensions, which is embarrassing at my age, but I want to learn so I can understand my money better and hopefully get it to grow. Unsure of the best trading and ISA platforms to use, especially for my country. 

I will be 36 in December and live in the UK. 

I am employed, full time. Earning £40k PA (if I was male in my company would be earning more) and circa £7k bonus each year although I had to forfeit my 2020 bonus due to covid. 

I have no debt (never have) but I have a mortgage which has £81.5k left to pay, current rate 1.54% and I pay £941 per month. I really want to pay this off as quickly as I can. 

I have a pension through my employer that I was paying 16% of my monthly wage into each month for a few years but since April 20 I reduced this to 6% (I was still working but my employer asked me to take a 20% wage cut for 9 months). My employer pays the minimum legal requirement, which is 3% currently. My pension savings are worth £19k. 

I currently have savings in my banks ISA (interest rate 0.05% tax free) and there is £7k.

Also have a Revolut account with £600 sitting in the account which I can withdraw or “invest”. I did follow some hype and bought £400 worth of shares at too high a price and have just sat on them - just a reminder to myself not to be so stupid to dive in as they’re at a loss and won’t reach the price I paid for them. 

Have been looking at Freetrade and Trading212 accounts that have access to more stocks and investment ISA’s which might be more beneficial for me? I don’t want to deal with CFD’s though.

I would say I have a moderate risk tolerance and I’d be prepared to completely risk £300 out of monthly wage to play with but I am open to all options available to me.

* 10k investment instead of paying off car loan immediately.  The objective is to turn this into more than 10k in a year
* My risk tolerance is high.  Even if I lost this 10k, I could still pay off my car without it affecting me too much financially
* Current holdings are in various ETFs, weed stocks I'm long on and some psychedelics related companies that I'm also long on 
* I also have a ""YOLO"" account that I trade with on RH with about 2.5k at the moment.  Anything over 2k at the end of the week I send back to my savings account and then eventually to Charles Schwab where I have my more serious investments
* No other debts other than my car loan

My plan for 10k is all in tech stocks.  Here's a list of tickers and how many stocks I plan on buying

* AAPL - 4

386,RH," So I'm pretty new to investing. I've been using Stash to buy increments of solid stocks each payday (Amazon, Google Tesla, etc). But I also wanted to invest in crypto. I know RH has really screwed up lately but they've also made some changes to make up for it. And more changes are on the way...one of them being the capability of  transferring crypto off their platform.

So when i decided to invest in a few crypto currencies, RH was the most cost-effective way to do it because it was free and it was fast. They gave me instant access for transfers up to $1,000. I don't have a lot of money so that was sufficient for me.

This is all pretty new territory for me. I've been hesitant to invest in crypto for a while and have finally bit the bullet and I'm happy that I have.

393,NAV,"  I was hoping to get some general feedback on my current allocation plan between self-directed choices vs ""safer"" targetdate and more conservative mutuals and ETFS.  I've had pretty good success over the past few years with self-directed investing (mainly value and dividend with a bit of growth thrown in), but completely understand this market has been super bullish and I want to make sure going forward I have a good amount allocated toward ""safer"" plays that no one (mainly my wife) could blame me for in the event things turn more bearish.  


I'm mid-thirties in the US and hope to be retired in about 20 years.  As a household we're doing well financially (two employed adults with little risk of losing jobs and no debt other than a mortgage) and can afford to take some riskier bets, but have dependents so we can't go too crazy.  


My plan is going to be:  
Total self-curated stocks/riskier etfs (e.g. ARK funds): 35%  
Total ""safer"" target date / other highly diversified long-term mutuals/etfs: 65%  


I'm envisioning this split between varying account types:  
Standard Taxable Brokerage - 30% curated / 70% ""safe""  
ROTH - 60% curated / 40% ""safe""  
DeferredIRA - 20% curated / 80% ""safe""  


For my ""safer"" plays I'm currently mainly in vanguard target date funds, VDIGX, VSGAX and VEU etf for international diversification.  


A few questions:  
1) Do people generally agree it make sense to make my ROTH the account with riskiest allocation?  I'm thinking from a tax perspective that makes the most sense and gives me the most freedom to get in and out of individual securities without worrying as much about tax implications.  


2) Did anyone have any suggestions on tax-conscious ""safer"" ETFS / mutuals / etc. to invest in for my taxable account?  


3) I currently have about $60k of unrealized long-term gains in a taxable account in self-directed investing that I'd like to re-allocate to ""safer"" funds.  Do I take all of this out this year before a potential capital gains increase next year or is there any benefit in trying to split it up between two years?  


4) I have about $40k cash in a taxable account that I want to park somewhere for about 2 years until it can be used as a down payment for my first rental property.  Any suggestions on pretty conservative plays for that?  I was thinking SPACS near NAV might be appropriate and offer some potential upside as well?  I'd hate to just keep it in pure cash as the fed continues to print money, but also do not want a March 2020 event to take out half of it right before I need to use it.

I have searched a little and found some information: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/happens-stock-company-gets-acquired-233217667.html#:\~:text=If%20the%20buyout%20is%20an,the%20company%20doing%20the%20buying](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/happens-stock-company-gets-acquired-233217667.html#:~:text=If%20the%20buyout%20is%20an,the%20company%20doing%20the%20buying).

for what I understood it can happen two things:  
1-If amazon buys amc, the shares of the stock we own disappear from the portfolio, and we get some cash?  
2-If amazon buys amc, the shares of the stock we own are converted to the amazon ones, but not at the one-to-one ratio. and since the diference is pretty big.... I dont really know what could happen....

Based on that info, the most probably logically thing to happen, is that the shares are converted to cash. And the value is gonna be set by the terms of the buyout...But theres no way on guessing the value right?

404,RSI," Hey amigos,

33 yr old here, just started investing this year with some money I inherited from my mother. 

Most of my money is in ETF’s (VOO and ARKG) and some stocks (DIS). The remaining ~15% I’m hoping to use to swing trade options, and then use whatever profits I make to buy more VOO and ARKG. 

So far, I’ve done pretty poorly with this, but after reading a lot about MACD and RSI, I feel like the mistakes I’ve made have been somewhat predictable and avoidable (literally bought the day before MACD crossed below signal line, w RSI at like 90).  Should have done more research first! 

One thing I’m confused about: What is the best time frame and interval to use when analyzing MACD to swing trade? It seems buy/sell signals vary greatly depending on the time frame and interval I’m using... I’ve done a lot of Googling, and can’t seem to find a solid answer. 

I’m hoping to buy options, hold for a few weeks, and then sell them for a couple hundred/maybe $1k, and then use that profit for solid investments. Also, I just think it’s kinda fun to try and swing trade options to make some extra money.

408,ST," How is everyone portfolio hedging for inevitable drop?

I'm currently heavily invested in equities (45% broad market funds, 45% growth stocks (mostly large cap, maybe 15 more speculative mid cap/agressive growth, 10% bonds), and having gotten my start trading in the late 98-99, the current situation smells exactly like 99 where every stock can only go up and there is a huge amount of euphoria/speculation in the air. The only thing I don't know is how much further it will go before the music stops (ie: how far the Fed is willing to go and for how long).

I'm familiar with the basics of options (single option strategies mainly), but what is the best way to hedge my portfolio? Out of the money puts is an option but could be somewhat pricey. Perhaps going to mostly cash and then selling cash secured puts (that would incur a huge ST capital gains problem).

I'm not anticipating a violent crash like last march but a more sustained drop  on any bad news (6+ months) with more largish red days intermittent consolidation and then more drops akin to 2000. Also anticipate recovery will be long and slow, not a V shaped recovery like last March (ie: sustained drop will keep a lot of buyers on the side lines) Not sure if longing way OTM volatility/VXX would give me the best long for my buck. Also looking for about 33% downside protection from current levels (pulled that out of my ass. But feel it is possibly realistic and is far enough away to be alittle cheaper). I already have some ST capital gains for 2021 I'd be willing to invest into the said protection (essentially tax loss harvest the protection if I'm wrong) but there is the chance the drop wont start or be anywhere near playing out by end of 2021. Another possibility outside of options is just rotating to value stocks (but would incur similar capital gains). I'm particularly bearish on certain areas (revenueless spacs/ev in particular) but feel they have the potential to drag down the entire market for a period of time.

How can I determine how much to invest to protect a portfolio of a certain size?

Anyone else begin thinking of hedging strategies without cashing out?",greenerdoc,-1,/r/investing/comments/lixso8/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gn7u6gq/,0.071,0.777,0.152,0.9864

428,ALL," >how index funds and ETFs work. But I have read enough to know that it  is relatively low risk and high profit when compared to mutual funds.

This really isn't true and I think you are confusing some terminology. ETF and MF are just how the fund is organized, ETF trade like stocks on an exchange , where MF you buy in daily the price only updates once a day .

Not Both ETF and MF can be index funds

Both ETF and MF can be actively managed

Some people for some reason assume ALL ETFs are low cost index funds and ALL MF are high fee active managed funds and this is not true at all

There are many low cost index fund MF, there are many high fee active managed ETFs so it really doesn't matter if the fund is a MF or ETF , what matters is the underlying assets or strategy .

>would like to know if I buy a few shares of VTI and VOO once., do I  have to pay monthly/yearly for the entire duration of my investment  period to get compound interests or is it just a one time buy.

Over time each buy will compound ; an overly simple example is lets say each year the fund goes up 10% you invest 1000 

Year 1 you end with 1100 profit 100

year 2 you end with 1210 profit 110

where did that extra $10 come from; well you gained 10% on your initial investment and 10% on your year 1 gains too

Find the different competitors and do a comparison. The most important item was for business users to be able to develop with limited/no help from IT.

I researched Automation Anywhere v Blue Prism v UiPath. To save all of the boring details UiPath had the advantage of being truly user interface-driven without having the need for a bunch of backend code. UiPath has 2 ""products"" for developing automations. In each, you have the ability to ""record"" your steps the same way macros used to work. Just press record, do your typical task, stop recording, and it will save all the activities to your project.  
Studio - Aimed at developer and more technical people.   
StudioX - Aimed at business users who want to drag and drop activities. Cant find an activity, someone has likely created one and you can pull it down from the package manager.

We have processes that used to take a person 3+ hours reduced down to 15 minutes. Not that this couldn't have been done by one of the other RPA solutions just our experience. But these processes were done with limited IT help and limited coding knowledge. I'm not confident any of the other solutions could have accomplished this.

UiPath is working on document understanding which could be huge if implemented correctly. It could process invoices that come in and create ""tasks"" for humans to verify if the confidence isn't high enough. AI paired with machine learning. Again not unique to UiPath. From what I understand Blue Prism has something similar.

The biggest issue I have found is that occasionally we have to ""kick off a job"" because the selector wasn't found the first run. These could be from a variety of issues like the web page didn't load fast enough to the window wasn't maximized. All of these are fixable, but all things you have to consider when building.

True, you cannot record all movements. But you can record in blocks. For example, logging into a website to download a file. Can be recorded. Save the recording and continue editing your process. Drag over the activity to move/rename a file. Iterate through csv/excel. Create vlookups. Put in formulas etc. No windows command needed.

True most business users don't know how to query a database, that is where the limited IT help comes in. I'm not saying that they download UiPath internally and just begin working on it without any help.

>Split through how many robots? Quick working robot makes mistakes (maybe due to weak server that was). Also, it requires picking different options to make sure robot passes input always correctly. On websites it usually requires wild cards and html/css skills.

One robot. Through creating the robot they discovered inefficiencies ""from the way they have always done it"". When typing an input into a website, you can use automation next which will automatically try to find an anchor and guide you through the process. You can also create fuzzy selectors.

This is the main point of RPA. You use the UI based automations for legacy applications because they don't have the modern technology to interface with; specifically APIs. If you use it to interact with modern applications you'd prefer to use the API route.

Many of these legacy systems aren't going away, which is the appeal for automating the processes in those systems. They are repeatable, consistent and the UI isn't changing. These are ideal processes.

> Drag over the activity to move/rename a file. 

Well you need to know the original filename then. If you don't know it you need to add custom code to find most recent file or something.

> Iterate through csv/excel. 

If the robot crashes (for not finding some selector for example) and robot restarts it doesn't start from the point it ended. Requires adding columns to check that. Extra checks and if/else. Putting delays, setting continue on error doesn't sound friendly to anyone except who knows about these things.

Saying you have to know HTML/CSS to create wild cards and me posting the link where it will create them. Now they aren't reliable. So if we always focus on the worst-case scenario, sure. It will never work as intended. With or without IT help.

463,IT," It's true recorded events aren't fail-safe. But they have the ability to continually modify the processes they create. If they hit play and it fails, they modify the activity/activities that are an issue.

Lots of industries have downsized. Groups that were 10 are now 5 or less. There are a lot of tedious tasks that are left behind that still must be done. Downloading files from websites. Reading files/tables from websites. These are things that UiPath can automate very easily. The issue is that IT staff also dwindles. The goal is to get business users trained and have power users for others to bounce ideas off of when they begin using it.

So the efficiencies become apparent when groups are no longer having to wait for IT to get around to learning their process just to implement a process. And if their process changes, they can edit the automation without having to wait around for IT. If the issue is more than business users can handle, they can pass the project to IT to get them over the technical hurdle and pass the project back.

I guess I should have said in my original post, not everything is a full-fledged end to end automation. Some things are just going to multiple sites and reading data and putting it into excel or downloading files from websites.

We do have some automations that are much more involved and only 1 was created end to end by IT. I'm not saying they are all created without IT help, I'm saying they were mostly created by people outside of IT.

I'd be cautious on this name. It was obliterated recently because of a situation (https://www.medtechdive.com/news/low-medicare-ekg-device-draft-slams-irhythm-stock-price-sinks-by-over-30/594229/) that (unless something has happened that I haven't seen) hasn't been fully resolved and could still go either way. After the significant bounce post this news, I sold the rest of what I owned. It's headed back lower since. I did well with it but two massive declines (huge decline on news in December, big ramp/recovery and at the end of January another, even more massive decline where at one point it was down 50% in a day) in two months is a bit much. If the situation is resolved well could bounce considerably again, if it isn't then could certainly go lower again. In any case, I'd like to like this stock but don't see revisiting it.

Just texted my Dad who is a real life Hank Hill, and just finished his 14th straight 12 hour day delivering propane. 

Zero shortage of fuel, but there is a shortage on hours of the day and manpower to deliver it. 

Pricing hasn’t changed at all in the past month, and he just waded through 7” of snow dragging the hose all day. So you could say he’s in a very high demand area. 

Best of luck with this one.

I would just start with a Roth IRA. I'm sure you know it. But the tax advantages compared to a traditional are amazing. And the limit of $6,000 a year is good enough to get started and grow over time. It's slow and boring at first but it will grow so much over her life.

And if she ever needs to take money out for an emergency she can with a Roth. You can take out what you put in, just none of the tax free growth.
