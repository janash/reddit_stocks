3,CTRM," First of all, I know almost nothing about shipping, so apologize my ignorance on this.

I am looking at DAC, DSX and CTRM, just a quick glance, at all the while DAC has YoY increase of 600% and (pun intended) it seems that ship has certainly sailed on this one, even more so the short interest adds another layer of uncertainty into the valuation formula for me. 

On the other hand, DSX and CTRM have both pulled back significantly through last few months, DSX is still up YoY by \~40%, CTRM is actually slightly down YoY.

All of this is quite conflicting a bit for me, 1 out of 3 is certainly in bubble territory seemingly, on the other hand, in the short term, other 2 might see reasonable bounce back up in short term at least, specially until container boom continues and will perhaps reflect in their Q1 results at the very least.

22,CTRM," See I dropped CTRM when I noticed they were acquiring older dry bulk ships which is for stuff like ores and grains. If the demand is in container ships with finished goods these guys might not be a good short or long term and why they haven't shot up. Yes we know ores and minerals are going to be huge for battery and energy tech but the age of these ships might not see efficient or long term use as demand for the materials their equipped to move increases.

I work in transportation and logistics on a regional/subregional level (on land) so I'm not expert and just scaling up combined with all I've ever heard second and third hand from living on the great lakes where dry bulk is pretty much all they ship.

While we don't know the repair and upgrades of these ships I believe they are close to 10 years old on average and the fleet will be varying sizes (for different canal passes) of 10 bulk carriers and 2 tankers when complete.

I personally regret not taking time into looking into dry finished goods shipping deeper over the past 2 weeks and using my schema from what I know about Lakers.

I might re enter CTRM though as it looks like their heavy dip attracted some buyers driving the price up. It's volatile and doesn't have the best reputation since they're being run very minimalist in a way where they almost look illegitimate. Given that all the company needs to do is own the ships and contract crews though they likely won't have a large team themselves. Overall, hard shrug on these guys.",Tacoman404,10,/r/investing/comments/lyzw4d/my_second_post_on_international_shipping_nyt_ive/gpyxewp/,0.065,0.845,0.089,0.8741

59,IMO," At one point not long ago I would have said it was a near certainty, but the fact that it’s started getting politicized gives me some doubt. At the same time, SLR extension isn’t actually necessary, or even IMO the most efficient way of addressing the problem. Removing the RRP counter party cap seems like the more obvious fix without making for some of the headaches that SLR would cause. I’m far from an expert in the mechanics of the funding markets, but I’ve spoken with (and read commentary from) a number of people who actually are and my takeaway is that regardless of exactly how this gets fixed, it’s going to get fixed one way or another. The fed has plenty of tools to unclog the system and everyone knows just how badly things end if they don’t.",fakerfakefakerson,3,/r/investing/comments/lynwgj/t_notes_bonds_why_stocks_are_selling_off/gpyq8n1/,0.072,0.837,0.091,0.2357

61,UAL,"  > Sorry to hear about what you and other pilots are going through.

Appreciate your sympathy. I fly for the USAF/air national guard as a reservist so I'm actually much better off than some of the other airline guys out there furloughed or whose companies shut down. At least I have a fallback.

 > I imagine there is an enormous amount of pent up demand for travel and flights.

That is the feeling overall. Since we're already seeing a transition to epicenter stocks my guess is we'll see a big uptick in Air BnB / Trip Advisor and definitely a lot more travel as things continue to come back and reopen. However that doesn't necessarily translate into better financial outlook. Here's my personal opinion below based only on publicly available information.

Consider that during the pandemic the legacy carriers were losing billions of dollars every month. Some of them (AAL) already had atrocious balance sheets going into it. Following years of greedy profit taking, stock buybacks, exorbitant c-level bonuses and ripping off customers the majors were in no way positioned to take the brunt of the economic effect. I don't know a single 121/scheduled air carrier that didn't take the bailout money. That means that even going into a recovery, the airlines will have new lines of debt. And given the airlines' brutal history of undercutting eachother out of existence, m&a, insolvency and overall volatility I would expect to see a tumultuous recovery period marked by consolidation, failure and disruption. The best players in the industry are currently the Low Cost Carriers (Frontier, Spirit, maaaayyyybe JetBlue) and DEFINITELY the Part 91k Fractional Companies (NetJets, FlexJet, XOJet). These companies' business models are built to be flexible, they lost the least during the worst part of Covid and they run lean and clean (Frontier's orders of new high efficiency Airbusses were amazing timing). The fractionals (e.g. NetJets) absorbed so much business flying that I have serious concerns about business flying coming back to major carriers soon (or ever at the level it was before) - that model is the future of commercial flying, they basically uberfied private charter which is perfect for giant blue chips that don't want to maintain a fleet of private corporate jets but want access to cheap, pandemic proof and flexible air travel. New entrants like Breeze (brought to you by David Neeleman) are also going to definitely disrupt here. Expect the fractionals, ULCCs and new entrants to take the lead with point-to-point outstation service (not hub and spoke which are killing the legacy major airlines) and they will lead with better service, cheaper tickets, actual plans to address climate change and leaner balance sheets.

So in summary - legacy majors (DAL, UAL, AAL) will probably be slow to adapt, be overencumbered with poor finances, suffer consolidation through competition, will continue to repeat the mistakes of their past (they can't help it) and will face hurdles from the pilot hiring crisis (this is a no-shit crisis that cannot be understated). Meanwhile ultra low cost carriers, fractionals and new entrants will disrupt the airline industry entirely. Will JETS ETF and individual airline stocks fly at some point and make you money? Probably. But the party may not last long once the recovery honeymoon period is over, and I personally won't touch them with a 10 foot pole. The legacy carriers are completely fucked in my most humble opinion. And yes I'm betting against my own company...",SPAWNmaster,8,/r/investing/comments/lynwgj/t_notes_bonds_why_stocks_are_selling_off/gpvmq9j/,0.106,0.81,0.083,-0.9615

The latter has been known forever, but still like...fuck em. Anyways, most if not all of those have covered so that’s out of the way.

70,TGA," It gives the system another option to absorb the cash that's coming into the system. The balance sheet constraints created by SLR rolloff means a) banks aren't buying more treasuries directly (hence the failed 7 year auction last week) and b) banks don't want to take new deposits.  If banks aren't taking the deposits then that excess cash gets pushed to MMFs which have to hold bills to meet their 2a7 requirements.  They do this by either buying more bills or by tapping RRP. If they get 50Bn of inflows but can only do 30bn of RRP then their only option is bills, but those already getting pushed towards negative territory because of supply constraints from the TGA drawdown.  Once bill rates go negative MMFs are going to start gating inflows.  

All of this has the same impact of making it more difficult for the system to absorb new UST issuance.  If RRP cap is removed it doesn't necessarily solve the bank balance sheet issues, but it releases stress from other part of the system increasing net demand for treasuries.",fakerfakefakerson,1,/r/investing/comments/lynwgj/t_notes_bonds_why_stocks_are_selling_off/gq0s00c/,0.142,0.85,0.008,-0.9768

They use bees to transport ecological phytosanitaires, which is by far more efficient than conventional spraying (>95% loss in spraying). Their product must meet high approvement standards as bees are involved, which means that growth is slowed down by regulations. On top of that they can only scale up on a season to season basis as farmers will only test their service and product on a small part of their land, then more next season, and so on.

Higher interest rates (even though they aren't even a thing yet) are going to hit high P/E companies especially hard because it means that they can borrow less and thus their growth is stifled. The higher 10 year bond is one of the indicators that the economy is returning to 'normal' and this may trigger a shift in the Feds fiscal policy which may mean an increase in interest rates earlier than originally anticipated. 

It is a bit of a double whammy this time because it also means that people are reassessing their allocation based on new risk/reward possibilities, higher bond yields which are essentially risk free mean that people who were previously over invested in stock can now reallocate a portion of their portfolio to bonds for a guaranteed return, if the yield crosses over the average dividend line (which it has already) then things get even worse in the short term for stocks. 

In the long run this is probably a short term dip, so people who aren't playing short expiry options will probably be fine if they hold in the long term. However if there is one thing I've learned is the market can remain irrational longer than the average person can remain liquid, so do your DD and for the love of god don't sell at a loss if you are holding stocks in a company you believe in long-term.",Razorfiend,15,/r/investing/comments/lypic3/why_cathie_woods_once_hot_ark_innovation_etf_has/gpuha5r/,0.074,0.838,0.088,0.7197

131,FT," I think its great if you bought ARKK for 10 years from now.  Even at its peak recently.  So long as the ETF remains solvent through some future black swan event.  But....the mid term looks dicey with any inflation.   Personally, I would rather own the actual stocks the ETF invests in to have some ownership and some rights.  But...I get it that looking at her daily positions is work.

To the OP, what a situation as it sounds like the individual wants to be an active investor (awesome) but has a long way to go to understand markets.  

I mean, look, my 401k is about as chalk and vanilla as you can get, outside the fact I have it allocated to a heavier emerging markets focus because I believe the US within 30 years will face a convergence of problems due to fiscal and wall street irresponsibility.  But I am also a gambler and love research (4 plus hours a day on bloomberg, FT, chart analytics, etc) so I tend to shoot for big gains on options outside this set allocation for retirement.  Im also a hyper bear, so my idea of speculation is, waiting for the black swan events to make a fortune.  Note...I am not dellusionally pessimistic calling for crashes daily.  But... puts on every damn high flying growth tech stock heading into 2022 January.  Having said all this, I wait a lot longer than most to place my bets as I am perfectly fine not making money on runups becuase I dont understand the euphoria when fundamentals are terrible.",cbdscienceguy,3,/r/investing/comments/lypic3/why_cathie_woods_once_hot_ark_innovation_etf_has/gpzf3u3/,0.07,0.825,0.105,0.8274

EPR will return with their focus on entertainment as people will spend a lot on that to mingle and have fun, once all restrictions are gone. Just be careful with office REITs.

&#x200B;

The first would be the demographic or age group of users playing Roblox. In their investor day presentation they stated they saw an increase of 107% of DAU's (daily active users) over the age of 13 in 2020. This is great but what I would really like to know if how many of those users are above the age of 18. These are the users that are most likely to own a credit or debit card and be making the micro transactions to generate their revenue.

(you can view the presentation here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XisxSUUbe8&ab\_channel=Roblox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XisxSUUbe8&ab_channel=Roblox) skip to 1:13:41 for the DAU chart)

&#x200B;

The second would be a build up from the DAU argument. How many of those DAU's are actual users vs bot? Now I don't think this is a huge point to be arguing because as you stated Roblox was the most viewed game on YouTube behind Minecraft so obviously the player base is there, but it's something to think about. In my opinion, more bots in a game makes me less inclined to play it.

&#x200B;

Finally, the third would be engagement hours. I assume a large percentage of their player base is under the age of 17-18 and are still in K-12 or whatever your country considers pre college. As we know in 2020 everyone was forced to continue education from home. More time in front of the computer = more time on Roblox? How many hours will users be able to commit to once school starts back up?

&#x200B;

151,DNN," If anyone wants to take a less risky position in the uranium market, they shouldn't invest in any miners, especially those such as DNN which will start mining at 2024 at the earliest. In the meantime, expect further dilution, which will make it highly risky to hold it long term in a highly volatile market.

They should instead invest in Uranium Participation Corp (listed on Toronto exchange) or Yellow Cake PLC (listed on London exchange) which invest in uranium by directly holding them in the storage. This means you won't be exposed to the exploration, development, and mining risks that come with the uranium market, and still be able to be a part of it. Of course, you won't be able to make as much if there is indeed an uranium bull run in the future, and you're still liable to a dilution, since the company issues more shares to purchase additional uranium when they feel that the stock is overpriced. Still, it is the safest way to invest. Go read the 10-K on their websites.

Some downsides (I’m no expert)
1) One downside I can think of is if some major nuclear disaster/accident happens. It could be due to either mismanagement or a natural calamity.
This can have a really long term bearish effect as it is hard to move on from something like that.

2) Emergence of more states with nuclear weapons and maybe high tensions of nuclear exchange (although it might never happens) between say India - China/Pak may hurt the sentiments. This is a very low risk imo.

3) Thorium - right now it is not the play as it is not extensively used in Nuclear reactors . But Thorium is generally more safe and efficient.
Also countries like India (followed by US) have massive reserves of Thorium. I have heard they are investing a lot to make Thorium work. While I don’t know the technical details, but someone who knows better told me that there could be major breakthroughs in Thorium tech in the coming decades which can make Uranium less preferred and potentially replace due to it being more abundant and easier to extract.
The reason I am telling this is because I assume Uranium investment is a very long play (few years atleast?) and if some major breakthrough occurs in Thorium or something else we are not sure what might happen?

Having said all this I continue to remain bullish on Uranium. So you recommend more on DNN or UUUU?",pSaCha,1,/r/investing/comments/lymi5h/still_bullish_on_uranium_also_i_have_not_been/gq0qs9v/,0.078,0.823,0.099,0.8529

208,FUV," ""why has the market been sooo terrible to me??""

This: ""mostly Large cap tech companies""

There has been a tremendous rotation out of tech and into financials and other things. Rotations happen and the issue becomes as I said the other day, feels like the market really used to be more broad and gradual and there'd be good and bad days but the gradual path was higher. Now it's ""this portion of the market does well and basically ramps for several months to a year - ""escalator up"" and then there's a panicked scramble into other things  (""elevator down."") I thought there'd be a rotation and was posting earlier this year that I was increasingly concerned with the ""100% Ark"" posts. For all the ""Cathie or Chamath is the new Buffett"" articles, it started to feel increasingly like it was time to invest with the current Buffett. For all the ""so and so is the new Buffett"" (Ackman, Lampert, now various growth investors) over the years, Buffett has ultimately remained the Buffett.

I thought the eventual rotation out of 2020's winners would be very significant but didn't expect it to be quite like the last couple of weeks. Last year was ""the more aggressive the growth the better"" and now this year ""the more aggressive/disruptive the growth story, the worse it's done.""

I did trim a lot of aggressive/disruptive growth in the second half of last year and early this year and switched to other things. Still have not had a good couple of weeks, but had I continued to own the same things would have been worse. MTCH I do own and I think that's something where I have to give them credit for doing a tremendous job navigating what I would have thought in March 2020 would have been a potential disaster for the company. From their shareholder letter: ""Singles are already posting their positive antibody test results and vaccine
confirmations on their dating profiles."" If anything, the impressive way that MTCH has handled the last year actually makes me more long-term confident in the company. It's a rare thing that I think actually did well during lockdowns (better than I could have ever imagined, given the nature of the company) and will do well when things re-open.

I don't even really have an issue with any of the companies you mentioned. I still own NVDA (and ASML), MELI, SQ. There's still absolutely a place for these sorts of names in one's portfolio, I just think that if ""large cap tech"" is the *majority* of your portfolio, that might not be the best place to be in the year ahead after the unusually fantastic year growth had last year and people may want to consider trying to diversify away at least somewhat from being largely a tech fund after last year's outperformance.

I think where the real problems are are things like SPCE (which Chamath just dumped before they even got going), LMND (which I never really understood the appeal of - not every industry needs a ""disruptor"" - and was trading at a very insane multiple), shroom stonks, battery companies that won't have a product until 2025, a lot of the EV stuff (the fact that FUV did what it did in the last year is absolutely absurd, it looks like a Kickstarter project and was a former Reg A IPO), etc. I think if people are majority large cap tech, that might be a problem in the coming year after what was a totally fantastic year last year. ""Rapidly growing but unprofitable"" is now looking like a very problematic place to be. ""Might have a product in 2025?"" type of situations are particularly problematic.

If you have aggressive growth holdings you have to really look at what you own and sit there and focus on what are your *very best* long-term ideas. It's not ""don't own any aggressive growth"", it's have a reasonable allocation to it where if periods like this happen it's not fun but it's not massively stressful. Have a portion of your portfolio dedicated to high quality companies that have a consistent track record of delivering over the years, have a portion of your portfolio dedicated to more speculative bets and maybe a very small % are dedicated to more far-out bets or short-term plays. You don't have to have investments in every single industry (and don't own something you don't give a shit about because it will inevitably be dumped sooner than later to make room for something you do), but you shouldn't own just tech or majority tech. If you want to benefit from inflation and couldn't give a crap about Exxon (for example), find some other inflation play that you find a better fit for your interests. 

I think this sub in the last year has gone from a lot of discussions about index funds and boomer dividend stocks to ""how many Ark funds do you own?"" The best thing for a lot of people is somewhere in the middle. People in their 20's should not have a portfolio full of stocks that look like they're from an AARP magazine article on investing but should definitely not be ""100% Ark"" either. People have to find their happy medium and maybe that's going to change over time and be dialed up and dialed down a bit but being largely at one extreme or the other isn't good and neither is frequently bouncing back and forth between the two. If you were all in Ark and now are dismayed after the last two weeks, the answer is not to go all into Coke and Walmart, either. It's trying to find somewhere in the middle where you're comfortable and where you can benefit to a satisfying degree during good times for growth and not be completely stressed out during the not so good. **And if your whole portfolio isn't aggressive growth, then you have to be even more discerning about what names make it into that aggressive growth portion of your portfolio.**

Some things that I shifted to worked very well during this and I wish I'd have shifted quite a bit more their way than I did. As things bounce with growth (which I expect as things get significantly oversold) I think the discussion people have to have with themselves is what do I want my portfolio to look like going forward?  A little over a year ago it was a scramble to figure out what would work in a new covid world, now a year later it's a scramble to revamp to figure out what things might look like as things return to some degree of normalcy and inflation becomes an increasing worry.  

Again, that's not saying ""get rid of all your growth tech."" Its not ""quality aggressive growth stories are over."" It's saying, ""maybe that can't be your entire portfolio going forward."" People also have to be even more discerning with the aggressive growth stories that they invest in and focus more on the eventual path to profitability. Or you have a long-term view and are okay with being reliant upon it through the good and the not so good.

I do think a lot of people new to investing piled in in January and February and I hope that this whole period doesn't discourage them; you do have to eventually get used to volatility and occasional periods like this, but I don't recall another period where so many people seemed to pile into investing (there were stories of brokerages with huge wait times because of all the people) and then something like this happened right after. 

These periods are very difficult, but they really do test your belief in what you own - if you look at something during a time like the last couple of weeks and your first instinct is to hit the sell button, maybe you didn't really believe it in as much as you thought you did in the first place. And there will be more of these periods in the coming years; you want to get used to them because these are the times you look around for opportunities - you don't want to be a seller and dumping your portfolio when everyone else is, too - that's really the time to look around for potential things to buy.",dvdmovie1,5,/r/investing/comments/lyykh9/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gpxyula/,0.059,0.774,0.167,0.9994

Now it's ""this portion of the market does well and basically ramps for several months to a year - ""escalator up"" and then there's a panicked scramble into other things  (""elevator down."") I thought there'd be a rotation and was posting earlier this year that I was increasingly concerned with the ""100% Ark"" posts. For all the ""Cathie or Chamath is the new Buffett"" articles, it started to feel increasingly like it was time to invest with the current Buffett. For all the ""so and so is the new Buffett"" (Ackman, Lampert, now various growth investors) over the years, Buffett has ultimately remained the Buffett.

I thought the eventual rotation out of 2020's winners would be very significant but didn't expect it to be quite like the last couple of weeks. Last year was ""the more aggressive the growth the better"" and now this year ""the more aggressive/disruptive the growth story, the worse it's done.""

I did trim a lot of aggressive/disruptive growth in the second half of last year and early this year and switched to other things. Still have not had a good couple of weeks, but had I continued to own the same things would have been worse. MTCH I do own and I think that's something where I have to give them credit for doing a tremendous job navigating what I would have thought in March 2020 would have been a potential disaster for the company. From their shareholder letter: ""Singles are already posting their positive antibody test results and vaccine
confirmations on their dating profiles."" If anything, the impressive way that MTCH has handled the last year actually makes me more long-term confident in the company. It's a rare thing that I think actually did well during lockdowns (better than I could have ever imagined, given the nature of the company) and will do well when things re-open.

I don't even really have an issue with any of the companies you mentioned. I still own NVDA (and ASML), MELI, SQ. There's still absolutely a place for these sorts of names in one's portfolio, I just think that if ""large cap tech"" is the *majority* of your portfolio, that might not be the best place to be in the year ahead after the unusually fantastic year growth had last year and people may want to consider trying to diversify away at least somewhat from being largely a tech fund after last year's outperformance.

I think where the real problems are are things like SPCE (which Chamath just dumped before they even got going), LMND (which I never really understood the appeal of - not every industry needs a ""disruptor"" - and was trading at a very insane multiple), shroom stonks, battery companies that won't have a product until 2025, a lot of the EV stuff (the fact that FUV did what it did in the last year is absolutely absurd, it looks like a Kickstarter project and was a former Reg A IPO), etc. I think if people are majority large cap tech, that might be a problem in the coming year after what was a totally fantastic year last year. ""Rapidly growing but unprofitable"" is now looking like a very problematic place to be. ""Might have a product in 2025?"" type of situations are particularly problematic.

If you have aggressive growth holdings you have to really look at what you own and sit there and focus on what are your *very best* long-term ideas. It's not ""don't own any aggressive growth"", it's have a reasonable allocation to it where if periods like this happen it's not fun but it's not massively stressful. Have a portion of your portfolio dedicated to high quality companies that have a consistent track record of delivering over the years, have a portion of your portfolio dedicated to more speculative bets and maybe a very small % are dedicated to more far-out bets or short-term plays. You don't have to have investments in every single industry (and don't own something you don't give a shit about because it will inevitably be dumped sooner than later to make room for something you do), but you shouldn't own just tech or majority tech. If you want to benefit from inflation and couldn't give a crap about Exxon (for example), find some other inflation play that you find a better fit for your interests. 

I think this sub in the last year has gone from a lot of discussions about index funds and boomer dividend stocks to ""how many Ark funds do you own?"" The best thing for a lot of people is somewhere in the middle. People in their 20's should not have a portfolio full of stocks that look like they're from an AARP magazine article on investing but should definitely not be ""100% Ark"" either. People have to find their happy medium and maybe that's going to change over time and be dialed up and dialed down a bit but being largely at one extreme or the other isn't good and neither is frequently bouncing back and forth between the two. If you were all in Ark and now are dismayed after the last two weeks, the answer is not to go all into Coke and Walmart, either. It's trying to find somewhere in the middle where you're comfortable and where you can benefit to a satisfying degree during good times for growth and not be completely stressed out during the not so good. **And if your whole portfolio isn't aggressive growth, then you have to be even more discerning about what names make it into that aggressive growth portion of your portfolio.**

Some things that I shifted to worked very well during this and I wish I'd have shifted quite a bit more their way than I did. As things bounce with growth (which I expect as things get significantly oversold) I think the discussion people have to have with themselves is what do I want my portfolio to look like going forward?  A little over a year ago it was a scramble to figure out what would work in a new covid world, now a year later it's a scramble to revamp to figure out what things might look like as things return to some degree of normalcy and inflation becomes an increasing worry.  

Again, that's not saying ""get rid of all your growth tech."" Its not ""quality aggressive growth stories are over."" It's saying, ""maybe that can't be your entire portfolio going forward."" People also have to be even more discerning with the aggressive growth stories that they invest in and focus more on the eventual path to profitability. Or you have a long-term view and are okay with being reliant upon it through the good and the not so good.

I do think a lot of people new to investing piled in in January and February and I hope that this whole period doesn't discourage them; you do have to eventually get used to volatility and occasional periods like this, but I don't recall another period where so many people seemed to pile into investing (there were stories of brokerages with huge wait times because of all the people) and then something like this happened right after. 

These periods are very difficult, but they really do test your belief in what you own - if you look at something during a time like the last couple of weeks and your first instinct is to hit the sell button, maybe you didn't really believe it in as much as you thought you did in the first place. And there will be more of these periods in the coming years; you want to get used to them because these are the times you look around for opportunities - you don't want to be a seller and dumping your portfolio when everyone else is, too - that's really the time to look around for potential things to buy.",dvdmovie1,5,/r/investing/comments/lyykh9/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gpxyula/,0.059,0.774,0.167,0.9994

It's not ""don't own any aggressive growth"", it's have a reasonable allocation to it where if periods like this happen it's not fun but it's not massively stressful. Have a portion of your portfolio dedicated to high quality companies that have a consistent track record of delivering over the years, have a portion of your portfolio dedicated to more speculative bets and maybe a very small % are dedicated to more far-out bets or short-term plays. You don't have to have investments in every single industry (and don't own something you don't give a shit about because it will inevitably be dumped sooner than later to make room for something you do), but you shouldn't own just tech or majority tech. If you want to benefit from inflation and couldn't give a crap about Exxon (for example), find some other inflation play that you find a better fit for your interests. 

I think this sub in the last year has gone from a lot of discussions about index funds and boomer dividend stocks to ""how many Ark funds do you own?"" The best thing for a lot of people is somewhere in the middle. People in their 20's should not have a portfolio full of stocks that look like they're from an AARP magazine article on investing but should definitely not be ""100% Ark"" either. People have to find their happy medium and maybe that's going to change over time and be dialed up and dialed down a bit but being largely at one extreme or the other isn't good and neither is frequently bouncing back and forth between the two. If you were all in Ark and now are dismayed after the last two weeks, the answer is not to go all into Coke and Walmart, either. It's trying to find somewhere in the middle where you're comfortable and where you can benefit to a satisfying degree during good times for growth and not be completely stressed out during the not so good. **And if your whole portfolio isn't aggressive growth, then you have to be even more discerning about what names make it into that aggressive growth portion of your portfolio.**

Some things that I shifted to worked very well during this and I wish I'd have shifted quite a bit more their way than I did. As things bounce with growth (which I expect as things get significantly oversold) I think the discussion people have to have with themselves is what do I want my portfolio to look like going forward?  A little over a year ago it was a scramble to figure out what would work in a new covid world, now a year later it's a scramble to revamp to figure out what things might look like as things return to some degree of normalcy and inflation becomes an increasing worry.  

Again, that's not saying ""get rid of all your growth tech."" Its not ""quality aggressive growth stories are over."" It's saying, ""maybe that can't be your entire portfolio going forward."" People also have to be even more discerning with the aggressive growth stories that they invest in and focus more on the eventual path to profitability. Or you have a long-term view and are okay with being reliant upon it through the good and the not so good.

I do think a lot of people new to investing piled in in January and February and I hope that this whole period doesn't discourage them; you do have to eventually get used to volatility and occasional periods like this, but I don't recall another period where so many people seemed to pile into investing (there were stories of brokerages with huge wait times because of all the people) and then something like this happened right after. 

These periods are very difficult, but they really do test your belief in what you own - if you look at something during a time like the last couple of weeks and your first instinct is to hit the sell button, maybe you didn't really believe it in as much as you thought you did in the first place. And there will be more of these periods in the coming years; you want to get used to them because these are the times you look around for opportunities - you don't want to be a seller and dumping your portfolio when everyone else is, too - that's really the time to look around for potential things to buy.",dvdmovie1,5,/r/investing/comments/lyykh9/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gpxyula/,0.059,0.774,0.167,0.9994
214,SQ," ""why has the market been sooo terrible to me??""

This: ""mostly Large cap tech companies""

There has been a tremendous rotation out of tech and into financials and other things. Rotations happen and the issue becomes as I said the other day, feels like the market really used to be more broad and gradual and there'd be good and bad days but the gradual path was higher. Now it's ""this portion of the market does well and basically ramps for several months to a year - ""escalator up"" and then there's a panicked scramble into other things  (""elevator down."") I thought there'd be a rotation and was posting earlier this year that I was increasingly concerned with the ""100% Ark"" posts. For all the ""Cathie or Chamath is the new Buffett"" articles, it started to feel increasingly like it was time to invest with the current Buffett. For all the ""so and so is the new Buffett"" (Ackman, Lampert, now various growth investors) over the years, Buffett has ultimately remained the Buffett.

I thought the eventual rotation out of 2020's winners would be very significant but didn't expect it to be quite like the last couple of weeks. Last year was ""the more aggressive the growth the better"" and now this year ""the more aggressive/disruptive the growth story, the worse it's done.""

I did trim a lot of aggressive/disruptive growth in the second half of last year and early this year and switched to other things. Still have not had a good couple of weeks, but had I continued to own the same things would have been worse. MTCH I do own and I think that's something where I have to give them credit for doing a tremendous job navigating what I would have thought in March 2020 would have been a potential disaster for the company. From their shareholder letter: ""Singles are already posting their positive antibody test results and vaccine
confirmations on their dating profiles."" If anything, the impressive way that MTCH has handled the last year actually makes me more long-term confident in the company. It's a rare thing that I think actually did well during lockdowns (better than I could have ever imagined, given the nature of the company) and will do well when things re-open.

I don't even really have an issue with any of the companies you mentioned. I still own NVDA (and ASML), MELI, SQ. There's still absolutely a place for these sorts of names in one's portfolio, I just think that if ""large cap tech"" is the *majority* of your portfolio, that might not be the best place to be in the year ahead after the unusually fantastic year growth had last year and people may want to consider trying to diversify away at least somewhat from being largely a tech fund after last year's outperformance.

I think where the real problems are are things like SPCE (which Chamath just dumped before they even got going), LMND (which I never really understood the appeal of - not every industry needs a ""disruptor"" - and was trading at a very insane multiple), shroom stonks, battery companies that won't have a product until 2025, a lot of the EV stuff (the fact that FUV did what it did in the last year is absolutely absurd, it looks like a Kickstarter project and was a former Reg A IPO), etc. I think if people are majority large cap tech, that might be a problem in the coming year after what was a totally fantastic year last year. ""Rapidly growing but unprofitable"" is now looking like a very problematic place to be. ""Might have a product in 2025?"" type of situations are particularly problematic.

If you have aggressive growth holdings you have to really look at what you own and sit there and focus on what are your *very best* long-term ideas.

215,GDP," A) Any dip like this is temporary. It might last 6 weeks, it could last 6 months. But it will eventually go back up. What you should worry about more than anything is bankruptcy of any company. I know it sucks for your money to seem illiquid, but it's not the end of it.

B) Market dips like this are great because you get to get a better position in most companies you hold. There is something call per cost basis, and you have an opportunity to lower that during dips. 

C) The dip is very needed. The market as a whole was as high as 4x the national GDP....which in theory includes public companies. It's not weird for the market to be close to 1.5-2x the GDP, because it's usually priced for 5-10 years out, but GDP doubles every 20 years. By any metric 4x is insane. 

D) Look at a companies financials, project their earnings out realistically and try to derive a realistic stock price that way. Then every buy you do will be fairly safe.",PressurePass,3,/r/investing/comments/lyykh9/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gpy1j46/,0.052,0.825,0.123,0.9411

234,RKT," Hey guys,

New to trading on margin and I think I made a pretty big mistake/lesson learned. I had 10 option contracts expire and get auto assigned for RKT. I was assigned 1000 shares totaling $21k that I did not have in my core account - so margin was used. I watched the stock soar, thought this margin thing is cool and bought 1000 more at $37, then held my way all the way back down to where we are today :( So I am down about $24k now.

Anyways - my plan is to hold these shares until RKT and the market makes another run and just pay the margin interest daily. **Since these losses are unrealized right now, if I were to deposit another $5k in, would I be able to buy with that or would it be applied to my unrealized margin debt?**

237,GME," Hey. I'm just investing for the first time. It's thanks to GME, of course. I only have around $3k to invest with at the moment and I'm sure I'll put it into long term holdings. I'm 30yo. 

My actual question is if anyone can recommend some good audiobooks to learn about investing maybe day trading. Most of my fellow retail stockers are listening to music but I want to try and learn something while doing my boring grocery tasks. I have a particular interest in learning about options, but I really need to learn everything from the ground up.

238,AAPL," 28 in the USA and just getting started with a taxable brokerage account. Make about $70k a year and already have a 401k through my employer that I’m contributing to heavily. So the goal here is to build some wealth that I can have access to in the next 15-20 years before the typical retirement age. I have a fairly high risk tolerance here, again because I don’t feel the need to use these funds at least for the next decade or two, so the short term market volatility doesn’t scare me because in the long run I know it will go up.

I’m planning to invest $5000 in my new brokerage account soon and am torn between just going all into index funds or going 50/50 between index funds and individual stock picks. The vast majority of the individual stock picks would be in proven large cap stocks that are steadily growing and I believe in (think AAPL, DIS, JNJ) with a very small percent going into some more speculative small/mid cap stocks.

So the question is what’s the best portfolio allocation for this $5000 considering my longer term goals? Is it smart to dabble in individual stocks and if so then what percent?

241,IT," Im 35, not new to investing in the big picture but new to wanting to do more on my own outside of an IRA/401k (maxed out contributions). I have a manager for that is maximizing returns and assisting with tax strategy, something I don't want to focus on myself. Not looking for someone to tell me exactly what to do but rather guidance on a general strategy. My general outlook for personal investing is much less risky that it is with my retirement savings where I am in a 90/10 situation currently. I want to use this account as an overflow to my emergency fund. My goals would be to reduce cash just sitting in bank getting no return  but with some flexibility make some bets (could be risky) for companies I believe in but have some diversification. My ESPP also feeds into this account. I work in the Healthcare sector. This is something I would try to feed monthly based on reserve cash flow. 

Current Positions: 17% Large Cap ETF, 21% Balanced MF, 20% Large Cap IT (this is also a holding in my large cap ETF so is redundant), 17% Large Cap Healthcare: the rest is risky bets on IT, Pharma and Consumer Cyclical.

242,DOW,"  Margin account questions

First off I will disclose that I am fairly new to investing. I had some money saved up before corona virus crashed the markets and went all in on airlines, oil, and DOW etf between May and early June. I use TD Ameritrade. At the time this was just a standard non-margin account. So my first experiences in the stock market have been fairly successful so far. Now I find myself sticking any spare penny I can muster into the market into something.

At some point along the way I decided it would be a good idea to change my account into a margin account incase the the market dropped and prices were too good to pass up. I haven't really used this to intentionally burrow money yet. I have only bought stocks for the actual dollar amounts I have deposited so far. I thought this would just grant me the ability to borrow money if I want to. But now after more research into how margin accounts work I am understanding this differently. Now I think when I changed my standard account into a margin account, this effectively changed my existing investments so that half were funded by me and half are funded by the margin account. If I am correct in my new understanding I am wondering if I will have to pay fees/interest on these initial investments that were bought with my own money. My first question is if anyone can please comment if my understanding is correct here?

I will provide some context around my second question. Right now I am very bullish on American Battery Technology Company(ABML). Their main focus is going to be Lithium recycling. I I think this could be a major player in an up and coming industry especially if the democrats push through any sort of electric vehicle or green incentives. Right now this is a penny stock so I can see these purchases don't have any margin requirements. Now the actual questions surrounding this:

* If this stock price drastically increases some day and is no longer a penny stock, would my account change this so there is margin requirements on it?
* Could this in turn change my margin requirements to be so high that I would get a margin call?

My final question: Since I am not really using any margin or purchasing any more than the actual cash value I have deposited, is it even worth having a margin account? Would I just be better off changing this back to a standard account?

247,USA," I have two rollover IRA accounts on fidelity from former employers.  I sold out of the mutual funds they were allocated in and bought up the entirety of those accounts in $GME stock.  I'm looking at avoiding capital gains tax when I sell the stock, and wondering if I move the stocks to a newly created Roth IRA with Fidelity, what the tax consequences will be?

At the moment it's \~6k worth of stock which I intend to sell once it squeezes.  As I understand it, if I transfer and sell the stocks from within a Roth IRA, I don't need to pay capital gains tax on the 5-6 figure return I'm hoping for?  I'd just be on the hook for taxes on the initial value of the stock when I transfer it from the IRA?  My thinking for transferring is if I sold inside of a traditional IRA I'd still have to pay tax when I finally cash out?  I'd also like to do some more investing / control my accounts so thinking the Roth would make more sense.

253,MCD," Joe Biden is threatening to start a tax of $1 per every $1000 traded. Of course, the example they give is if you are buying small quantities of a fund, and holding forever - you don't end up paying very much tax in this scenario. Except, wait, you do. Because every time your fund re-balances to keep their index or otherwise makes a trade; you are paying.

Also, many people don't invest like this. Many people prefer to set their own goals and seek their own financial freedom. I know that I do. I enjoy investing, I prefer to choose the companies I own, and I already have a system where I pay taxes on my salary of about 31% (state, federal) then I use that hard earned, hard taxed money to buy shares of my favorite company, say, MCD who pays tax on what they earn and every burger they sell is taxed before I get to enjoy the fruits of ownership; but wait, if I make money by owning a company (funds that I and the company have already paid tax on) - Uncle Sam wants another 31% cut. When I loose money, does Uncle Sam want to share in what I've done with my money then? No, of course not. Now they want to take money just so I can have the \*privilige\* of investing my money?

257,GME," I don’t endorse this strategy, but I’ll answer your questions.

When you take money out of a traditional IRA, you pay income tax on the full amount withdrawn. When you roll over a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, you pay income tax on the full amount rolled over.

(This is assuming you don’t have any after-tax contributions to your IRA - you probably don’t since they’re rollovers from a 401(k).)

Once your money is in a Roth IRA, you never pay taxes on it again for capital gains or dividends.

Buying and selling within a Roth or traditional IRA is not a taxable event. You can feel free to reallocate your investments at any time within an IRA and suffer no tax bills. Making dividends in a Roth or traditional IRA is also not a taxable event. The only taxable event is withdrawing money from a traditional IRA or rolling the traditional IRA over into a Roth IRA.

So the question is: do you pay taxes now by rolling over the IRA into a Roth, or taxes later by not rolling over? It depends on whether you expect your marginal tax rate to be higher now or in the future. But if you roll over, YOLO into GME, and lose everything, you’ll feel pretty stupid for having paid the taxes for little to no benefit. On the other hand, if you 10x your money, you’ll be glad it’s in a Roth since your marginal rate will be higher in the future.

Also, if you withdraw your money before age 59.5 in either type of account, you may be subject to penalties. But that’s not relevant here since you’re not touching your money until retirement.",BobSanchez47,1,/r/investing/comments/lyyjy0/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gpzuuje/,0.081,0.824,0.095,0.8049
