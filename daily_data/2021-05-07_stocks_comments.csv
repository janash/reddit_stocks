EDIT: Apparently they are working with Samsung on new process which every chipmaker is doing. Announcing something 3-4 years in advance is vaporware to generate positive buzz. I don't doubt we will have 2nm chips sometime in future but when we do, 1-2 foundries will be making them and everyone big (nVidia, Apple...) will be designing chips.

5,IBM," > “Right now, in the most advanced production in the world is about the 7-nm node, you know **on the verge of getting** to 5-nm node,” Darío Gil, SVP and director of IBM Research, told Yahoo Finance.

am I not allowed to laugh? such a bullshit article provided by the dinosaur.

also,

> In 2017, IBM revealed that they had created 5 nm silicon chips,[13] using silicon nanosheets in a gate-all-around configuration (GAAFET), a break from the usual FinFET design. The GAAFET transistors used had 3 nanosheets stacked on top of each other, covered in their entirety by the same gate, just like FinFETs usually have several physical fins side by side that are electrically a single unit and are covered in their entirety by the same gate. IBM's chip measured 50 mm2 and had 600 million transistors per mm2.[14][15]

meanwhile Apple has shipped like 100 million devices with 5nm and 3nm is next year thing. Also no idea where marketing lies in this. and about yours

52,AMD," This is a good summary, but they aren't just experimenting with Big little, and it's literally coming to market Q3 or at the latest Q4 this year via Alder Lake. They actually already had a very low volume essentially proof of concept chip come to market, admittedly it wasn't that good, but it was 1 big core 4 little for ultraportables. Now that's scaling up through the entire consumer product stack.

I'm not entirely sure how things will go for Intel, nobody is, but it's definitely far more interesting times for them than in the last 5+ years. They could catch up to AMD in nodes (since AMD won't ever have the latest due to Apple), and their own chiplets and multiple die solutions are going to cut costs and increase performance and lower power, plus IDM 2.0 which opens their fabs and patents to others, and mobileye which has 13/15  (and more smaller ones) of the biggest car manufacturers.

There is a LOT going on at Intel.

Also remember that the semi and fab industry never moves at breakneck speeds, on one hand this is great, as we will finally see what Intels competition to AMD zen is, since typically designs and fabs are 3-5 years in progress, the slightly bad news is, it means that Pat as CEO only has so much ability to steer the ship, as it's a slow moving industry.

Something I should have said higher up in the thread is that I don't think the node is Intel's problem.  Their bigger issue is that they don't have a CPU architecture that can compete right now.  The node wouldn't matter so much if the architecture was decent.

That's why the big.LITTLE designs and chip-stacking stuff is interesting.  They are pouring money into precisely the kind of research it takes to overcome these problems.

Intel's market cap is over 230 billion dollars. AMD's is like 93 billion.  That's today, right now, with all the problems taken into account.  They have the money to ""fix"" this problem.  It sucks that it takes time but it's not like they can just call up a guy and ask for a better CPU lithographer.

In addition to this, the United States small business administration is absolutely slaughtering our small business owners to the point where even if these lockdowns were nonexistent at this point we mostly won’t have enough capital to hire on people out a quality wage to re-open the business or reestablish it.

The SBA has only approved a small percentage of grants that were supposed to be available for majority of business owners which is hurting small business recovery.

The SBA is also denying people who have already received an economic injury disaster loan their loan modification increase to re-open their business if the IRS hasn’t produced their tax transcript yet which as we are all aware that IRS is significantly behind on peoples taxes. 

So if your business that went into lockdown which majority did you lost a lot of money and then you’re expected to rehire people with the limited cash that you have after receiving a loan last year that was supposed to last you six months which has already been exhausted six months ago and then you’re denied 24 months of additional working capital to help open your business because IRS is behind...

Lots of big tech have crushed analysts estimates across the board and have seen basically no movement.

But now we are seeing crazy forward earnings already being priced in.

Then we got the Fed operating like a circus. The government putting the population in a cash fan tube. Unemployment being more profitable than most hourly paid positions in the country.

159,HPE," From my trading journal:  (not financial advice)

The NASDAQ has, in recent history, ended dips and corrections after at least kissing the 100-day SMA. The NASDog is finding support on the 50, but this could also be semi-experienced and/or impatient traders ""buying the dip"" after seeing support on the 50-day yesterday. This occurred back on 2/23 with the NASDAQ finding footing on the 50, moving up and trading choppy for a few days before ultimately making final bottom on 3/8. To feel confident in a rally if the NASDAQ does not make lows, I’m looking for price to reclaim the 20-day SMA.

You raise a good point and long-term one has to wonder if this sort of policy is really sustainable.  I'm not talking about an immediate crash - the economy is improving, albeit slowly, and inevitably things are going to recover from Covid sooner or later.

266,MMT," I wouldn't be so sure about that. Last time the Fed tried to taper rates, it caused a market upset in 2018 and that was \~80% gains ago. The Fed knows if this bubble pops, it might pop for good, because billions and billions of dollars are sitting in underfunded pension and retirement funds that can't afford a market crash and would require trillions of dollars of government intervention in equities markets, which puts us right in line with China-level fiscal policy. It's much, much more likely that the Fed will allow inflation to run very hot (possibly north of 10%) to avoid a situation where they can be blamed for the crash that will dwarf the GFC because of the easy money policy they've provided for the past decade. Japan is a bad example because their entire society is in a deflationary period. 

People say ""well inflation hasn't happened in 40 years.. so it's unlikely to ever happen"".  Apply that logic to the odds of getting into a car crash: As you spend more time spent on the road, it becomes less likely that you get into an accident? I don't think so. Also, ""past results are not indicative of future performance"". If the ""roaring 20s"" thesis plays out this summer, inflation will be rampant. If demand for the dollar falls off because of US instability, inflation could be incomprehensible. That last part is what they are trying to avoid at all costs, because it will bring this MMT experiment to its knees.",kaleidoscope_eyelid,1,/r/stocks/comments/n6iw9i/buckle_up_ladies_and_gentlemen_fed_warns_of/gx9mrg3/,0.067,0.845,0.088,0.5811

It's only since 2019 after the 2018 dip that they started soaring, up to 20+ and then after COVID 30+ Lets assume they meet earnings expectations which even I, an AAPL bear, think is a safe assumption - that means that if the stock price stays exactly flat for months (is that what AAPL investors want?) they'll reach the forward ratio of 25 - that's still like at least 35-40% above where they’ve normally been when the market is not in a bubble about to pop.

You're doing options wrong if this is your take on them. The problem is that people focus on moon shots instead of high probability, low risk plays that don't necessarily have gigantic upsides. It isn't exciting to buy a deep ITM LEAP on a stock that /r/valueinvesting likes and sit on it for nine months, but you'll likely get a good pay out if you do. It isn't exciting to do a bull call spread in the wake of a stock pulling back. It isn't exciting to do a bull put spread on SPY. It isn't exciting to do a 30-45 DTE iron condor on a stock that never moves and doesn't have earnings coming up.

 - Gaming only cards    
 - Mining only cards

Nvidia is trying to destroy the market for *used* mining cards, that was undercutting their gaming card profits.

You can't buy AMD CPUs too and these aren't used for mining. They're just the fastest gaming and productivity CPUs. It doesn't help they are made in the same TSMC fabs as GPUs, car chips and almost all other chips actually.

Logitech grew their gaming division revenues by 117% in the recent quarter. Corsair by 72%. 

Not sure about Logitech margins within their gaming division - but given that gaming is 25% of their revenues and as mentioned Logitech has almost double margins as CRSR, stands to reason that they also have much better margins within the gaming segment.

I would also echo the comments of others here regarding antitrust breakups, that they are few and far between (AT&T was 40 some years ago and Standard Oil was 100 years ago). I don't know however, if we can necessarily extrapolate from history that a breakup would automatically be a good thing. In the case of something like Google, even though I salivate over the thought of being able to receive and own Youtube shares, it's not entirely clear that there would be no adverse impact on the Youtube business (loss of search synergies, having to host Youtube outside the Google infrastructure, etc.).

I also think about the point you raise about Amazon. When Bezos  came out in favor of Biden's infrastructure plan (and a rise in the corporate tax rate), the commentary revolved around how Amazon would benefit from public infrastructure spending, and how they don't pay the full corporate tax rate anyway. But I think that's missing the point: these corporations are walking on thin ice, with over a decade of spectacular success generating substantial financial wealth to their high level employees, all while a lot of other folks in the country did not do well at all.

The subscription model is cheap compared to a gum membership for their target market and they have plans for more hardware to attract more customers.

Biggest threat is probably Apple - they launched their own fitness content and already have strong shares in hardware and adoption. But that’s not going to take off for the next few years, likely, so I’m bullish on PTON for now. I bought at $83 and feel like a rise back to $120 is likely in the next 6 months.",Logan__Squared,9,/r/stocks/comments/n6zfku/pton_peloton_over_reaction/gxa11yo/,0.053,0.738,0.21,0.9806
419,DD," For some reason people on r/stocks (and reddit in general) hate the peloton product but everyone I know who has one loves the product (both bike and treadmill) and community (subscription service). I've used it myself (my cousin bought a treadmill) and it's a fantastic product. 

Is the price high to buy one? yes

Is it worth it? It's like any fitness product - if you use it regularly of course it is. If it ends up int he closet it is not

OP I would really encourage you to do your own DD and not listen to reddit - the truth is no-one here knows more than you about what a fair share price is (never mind one in this market)",thatssodisrespectful,4,/r/stocks/comments/n6zfku/pton_peloton_over_reaction/gxb0sno/,0.017,0.732,0.251,0.9876
420,PTON," It's a complete overreaction and a great buying opportunity.  And PTON bears just don't get this company.  Here are my two cents:

1. The financial impact of the treadmill recall is almost nil.  They hardly had to adjust their revenue projections at all to account for the impact.
2. The earnings they just released showed that growth and retention are still incredibly strong and weren't just a COVID phenomenon.
3. The company isn't just equipment with a tablet attached.  The expensive bikes and treadmills are just the first step in the process of getting customers into the ecosystem, much the same way that Apple uses its hardware.  In Q3 paid digital subscriptions grew 404%.
4. People keep saying that gym reopenings will kill PTON's growth but that simply isn't true.  PTON appeals to people who want the social aspect of workout classes from the convenience of their own home.  Plus, part of their strategy is to partner with hotels and gyms so people can go to a gym, connect to their PTON account on the gym equipment, and still do their favorite class.  Besides, this company was growing very strongly before COVID.  Q1 2020 saw 116% growth in digital subs and 103% revenue growth.
5. Any company can create a connected bike or treadmill but what other companies can't duplicate is the brand value and community aspect that PTON dominates.  Think of Lululemon as an analogy.  There's nothing special about yoga pants and many other companies tried and failed to duplicate their success.  They failed because people want Lululemon yoga pants.  Apple is another good analogy.  They dominated the smart phone market for years because there was a cool factor associated with being an iPhone owner.  PTON has that cool factor; other companies don't.",SirGasleak,4,/r/stocks/comments/n6zfku/pton_peloton_over_reaction/gxaf1wl/,0.057,0.78,0.163,0.9843
421,PTON," PTON was overpriced. PTON had a PE Ratio over 1000 less than six months ago and is now finally starting to work down to a somewhat expected range (100 - 150). Hype drove their stock price up that high, not their fundamentals. Now that there is a lawsuit tainting the company, the hype dies, the stock price drops.",hellarad,1,/r/stocks/comments/n6zfku/pton_peloton_over_reaction/gxa5zho/,0.035,0.965,0.0,-0.2263
422,PTON," PTON needs a long term strategy to remain viable.  Hype and emotionalism are not business strategy.  Their commercials are so cringe and fake.  Plus, people have been locked up for a year. How many people are going to be indoors riding a stationary bike this summer with some dipshit instructor feeding them faux emotionalism.  Also, human nature with exercise equipment: it is purchased emotionally and then goes unused.  It is a highly cyclical, highly seasonal, high risk business.  The stock was overvalued because people were in lockdown, it is gonna crash back to earth.  I have been in the fitness industry for 10 years, human psychology never changes. Great business around New Years and winter, mass drop off after.  Rinse repeat, and there are always new exercise fads.  Finally, they are in a saturated industry and have massive competition not only from Mirror and other equipment + streaming companies but also from thousands of fitness apps, outdoor sports, and the thousands of channels of fitness content on roku, Vimeo, utube etc for in home exercise.",thedrishti,0,/r/stocks/comments/n6zfku/pton_peloton_over_reaction/gxa49e2/,0.065,0.897,0.039,-0.384

425,PTON," 100% this. 

All the other brands operate in a fragmented space. Peloton by far has the most mindshare in the health equipment space. While this means jack to most people here, the implication is that the moment PTON releases a new product or service, everyone will know about in less than a week. 

You can't say the same about:

* Precor
* Nautilus
* Woodway
* Technogym
* Stryker
* Life Fitness

&#x200B;

For anyone thinking that Google or Apple will get into this market, apple will tread lightly. Google will buyout someone and the shut it down and release a far worse product.

428,PTON," I agree with a lot of what you said. 

I got in during the dip yesterday, got out at a gain today but I think the stock will go a bit lower so I'll wait till then before I buy back. 

Alot of people saying PTON is in trouble as gyms are reopening - but tbh actually I would be worried if I was a gym owner as COVID definitely accelerated disruption in the fitness space - everyone I know that has a peloton won't go back to the gym because of how great the product is. 

Also, once the PR blows over with their treadmill - that's a huge catalyst for growth. 

Is it expensive? certainly but I really like the lululemon analogy you've used. Also being first in the space should also serve them. I dont see apple google or anyone else getting into the treadmill or bike space...even from a fitness perspective apple google and whomever else leave a lot to be desired.

But there are other companies that I believe overall will be good long term I will buy no matter the timing. 

Time in the market is better than timing the market as they say. Now I’m more into just striking when something dips or is considered undervalued. Never wait for a better price or for earnings to hit.

470,BABA," Unregulated monopolies are fantastic businesses, especially in tech.

I’ve gone through a gut-wrenching portfolio allocation strategy over the last four months and bounced from low fee ETFs, to “value” stocks, and landed on big tech and feel good about it. I own Amazon, FB, Google, and Microsoft. These are some of the most profitable companies in human history - they also have a growth runway. I came to the conclusion I’d rather be sitting in Google than, say, Verizon, big pharma, Lockheed, or tobacco. 

Except for Amazon I don’t know if these are decade-long holds but they’ll get you through the next few years until anti trust ramps up. Amazon for me is a long term hold.

For me personally I hold them in the order of Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google. I don’t own the big daddy Apple. Microsoft is probably the most overvalued of them that I own on a historical PE basis. Polen Capital has a good framework that I like.

478,DD," I'll be honest, I started investing in ETFs a few months before the March crash, and then after the crash I saw all of these tech and high growth stocks 'on sale' like Uber at 18$ so I bought into it, and did minimum research. I'm glad to say I've since sold out of Uber around 48, made a great profit as an incompetent investor, but as I've started learning more and more and actually doing somewhat proper DD before I invest into something I've learned that these companies really aren't what most investors seem to think they are. 

So if I'm not mistaken, Uber has either sold or given up on their autonomous division. Legislation regarding their 'employees' is in the pipeline which will probably destroy their already terrible margins, they have NO customer loyalty, customers just go to literally whoever offers the cheapest service or has the best promotion going on at that time and profitability is still a huge problem for all of them. 

Personally I wouldn't invest in any of them, especially not at their current valuations.",SorrowsSkills,1,/r/stocks/comments/n6x07v/grubhub_vs_uber_vs_doordash_for_automation/gxaugvj/,0.106,0.745,0.149,0.7855
479,GM," we are so far from automating anything not on rails its speculation at this point.   
People hate this, but most of the driver automations  that exist are just  driver assists that are repackaged expansions on Volvo's driver assist technology which has been present on Volvo's commercial vehicles for ages.   


I simply have never been impressed by the frequency results of these companies, if this is happening. Then why are they having frequency at the level of normal cars?   Also there is kind of this knife hidden under complex vehicles, as technology drives up cost it also increases total losses as cars that strike anything are just likely to damage the complex systems that are not easily replaced, as a result current automation setups are just not working as you would expect.   


If I had to bet on a system that was going to win the automation races it would be NVIDIA. Tesla automation systems sucks and has people who don't know how to read insurance pricing looking at it as  Technology company.   and GM apparently has something so impressive no one can see it.  Uber had something so good they abandoned it, in 2015 in Pittsburg.   Simply put  accident avoidence is not  self driving, reading lines is not machine vision . These systems have to go much further before we can count on anything remotely marketable being called automation.",No-Development-130,1,/r/stocks/comments/n6x07v/grubhub_vs_uber_vs_doordash_for_automation/gxaw5ei/,0.134,0.804,0.062,-0.9411

I'm also in IMBBY, not sure about the long-term future but the value right now is undeniable.  Believe it or not I actually sold out of MO and UVV recently because they were my lower conviction picks... but now that I'm realizing my risk tolerance isn't what I thought it was I'm regretting putting that money into indexes.
