34,DD," Well, I think that if it was possible to know what the ceiling was and what the chances were, then stocks like these would enjoy far more popularity among investment institutions and algorithm trading.

It is something that you have to judge by yourself after reading all the available information. If you haven't read it yet, my original DD post (link at the start of the post above) is a good start.

If you want to know the ceiling and a likelihood, the best place to start is to know exactly what you are waiting for. Are you after the likelihood and price at finding a trap in well #3? At confirming a conventional resource? At confirming 40+ billion barrels of oil? At the beginning of oil production?

The further you go, the more difficult it is to estimate. You should also be aware that the sheer potential amount of oil that is possible here will drive a considerable amount of speculation. The price will not be bound to fundamentals for a while.

45,DD," Great find.  Business model looks great.  Looks like a substantial part of their business is selling their product in exchange for royalty interests in the various mines.  Entry point for the stock is still good with strong upside.  I have been looking for a new stock to throw cash at for a while.  I checked up on your DD and there are a few clarifications that are important to make: 

\#1) They are not sitting on $22 million in cash.  Actually it is $4.4 million or so in cash on hand.  What they have is $22 million in assets (which includes the cash).  The lion's share of the assets is its investment in Golden Planet Mining.  Based on the latest round of funding for that project, their investment interest is worth something like $11 million.  It looks like they have also listed some of their other royalties as current assets on the balance sheet (which isn't a problem), but it isn't the same things as cash on hand.  But they are still in a pretty strong cash position and it doesn't look like they will need to do an equity raise unless they start to moving into some acquisitions.

\#2) The total number of shares would be a little over 101M because there are more than 7 million outstanding options and warrants.  Still a reasonable number, but that is the number from the most recent financial statement published on SEDAR.

\#3)  They are not operationally profitable just yet.  More at a break-even point right now.  The profitability comes into play when you consider the increase in value of certain held investments.  But on a cash basis, their revenues and expenses line up pretty closely.  I do agree that growth year over year has been pretty solid.

None of these are huge issues, and I think there is great potential here.  I threw some money into this and I am excited to see what happens over the next few years.",SnidelyWhiplash1,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/mr3ae9/deep_dd_goldspot_discoveries_ticker_spotv_a/gunn7t7/,0.008,0.72,0.272,0.998

49,ALOT," The ""pump and dump"" would've been back in February. There is no big spike nor massive drop-off since it began moving back in December. And I'm of the mind that this is one of the more grounded penny stocks out there, with lots of news coming from the company, great QTR over QTR performances, expansions, acquisitions, and NYSE filings are being reviewed as we speak, meaning it'll open to ALOT more players and money.

Out of all the penny stocks that Ive looked at with a stupid PO Box number in Bumville with no actual performance to their names getting pumped and dumped over the course of a day or a week....this is not that.

This company is on the move imo, and is no way related to the pump and dumps that we see on ""shadow companies"" here.

One of the largest retail footprints in an emerging market....(granted it's Canada), but imo the only thing holding them back is legislation. That's the bet with this company. And that could be a few more years wait before they really push into the US market.

I've only got about 5% of my portfolio in this company, but it's one that I see myself continuing to add to, averaging down whenever possible, and riding this as far as the emerging Marijuana market takes it. Out of all these stupid quasi-pharmaceutical companies that are all doing some sort of trials and you're wagering their success...this is one that isn't playing that convoluted game. They are simple. Retail Marijuana. This, imo, is like betting on a publicly traded alcohol retailer. Alcohol storefronts don't go out of business. People buy alcohol, regardless of the economic climate. Same will be said for MJ, once it makes its rounds and gets cemented. Well, this company has a headstart on that process and will at least be around for the beginning of the MJ expanse. Whether they'll survive the onslaught of the mass migration to MJ, time will tell. But once the flood gates open, High Tide should at the very least see stock prices increase to match their expansion and favorable MJ legalities.",Don_Julio_Acolyte,7,/r/pennystocks/comments/mrgn0m/who_else_is_averaging_down_on_hitif_sucker_is_now/gum8963/,0.058,0.897,0.045,-0.2393

97,RS," No, but as the other user said it’s highly likely.

Reverse splits are generally frowned on as it’s usually an underlying problem with a company if they’re losing stock price and RS in order not to be delisted. If they believed they’d recover share price organically they wouldn’t necessarily worry.

In HITI case they’re diluting to raise funds, and then likely going to RS prior to uplisting to meet the share price requirement. Now it’s not necessarily a bad option, but people are selling up as short term it’s seen as bad for price (see the share price). Depends on what they’re going to use this funding for and what they do when they uplist. You would hope if they uplist they would stop or lessen diluting as that will drive down price when they won’t want to do so at risk of delisting.",Narradisall,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/mr9dji/daily_plays_april_15_2021/gum173c/,0.108,0.765,0.126,0.4556

BBKCF pumped already, it looks like you got a small bit of a bounce right now, but that's a BULL TRAP as far as I'm concerned.  It's extremely volatile and I recommend you evaluate the odds of it going up after a pump (not likely) or crashing (as they always do).

Based on what you said, have yet to look into it further, we need to know what this ""option"" entails. I have a few scenarios in my head:

Anyhow, I just put in $500. I have a 401k through work which I'm not touching. I'm basically going to just make stupid decisions with $500 for as long as it lasts. 

I'm just doing cash, not margin. 

I think I understand the cash settlement rule. 

Here's what I don't understand. Let's say I buy $50 in stock and then sell it at $55 the same day. Can I do that a couple times in the same day as long as I don't run through more than $500? Like, I can do it 5 times, but, if I do it 10 times I'm in trouble? After that, I have to wait a couple days for everything to settle? Is Ameritrade going to close my account for doing tiny buys and sells?

Obviously I need to read a lot more- is there a good quick start guide somewhere?

Recon could have 100's of billions worth of recoverable oil, meaning the value of that land they control by acre would be immense. Farm out contracts, joint venture and self production will likely jack their market cap up to 25-50b in the next few years. There is a rail nearby, good roads, and a port a few hundred kilometers away at walvis Bay. When you have huge oil assets, getting production going is easy.

143,COIN," The whole fake article thing was one of the more bizarre and sketchy things I have seen recently.  Much weirder than just the usual Hindenburg hit piece type deal.  I think AABB has the potential to continue to do well over time as they complete more phases of their plan.  That said, I'm not sure this whole idea is the correct path forward.  If this was some great idea, you'd see it done more frequently.  

Also, it is one thing to pursue actions like ""having Reddit remove claims that you are a money laundering front"" and ""try to find out who published a fake PR in the name of your company that alleged a false merger"".  It is very different to try to sue alleged stock manipulators.  I don't see how anyone gets to the latter from the company saying they are doing the former.  

People are just acting weird in their refusal to be patient and let things play out.  Oh, did the stock go down yesterday?  So did almost all of tech between Powell, COIN shenanigans and countless other factors.  That doesn't make AABB the victim of nefarious actors.

145,TA," $AGYP is a scam. 

\#1 Allied Energy Corp. has not had a SEC filing since 2013 and has not had audited financials and they are doing a promotion type pump to sell their share dilution. 

They are dropping tens of millions of shares on the float.

&#x200B;

That is a + of just under 10 million shares with millions more on their way. Proof? Read below

\#2 This is a share selling scam - more proof on Page 4-12, yes 8 pages worth of convertible notes and debt [https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/financial-report/274872/content](https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/financial-report/274872/content) that may become worth more than the overall market cap soon of the company.

146,CBD," u/multicraft1 response he messaged me and said it's not showing because reddit is screwing up.  Reddit has been having problems today.  His response below

""I have been in the food manufacturing business for many years and I can tell you those systems BBRW makes cost an absolute fortune. The plant I help manage has over 50 $million in stainless equipment just like the ones they make and that is only one plant. They are not limited to only brewing equipment with the skilled crafters they have on staff and they can manufacture equipment for the entire food industry if requested.

Your comment on them using only USA stainless steel is very important. The overseas steel is not of the proper grade and can show stains as well as harbor bacteria as it is of inferior grade. The world market has become very conscious of food safety in the last few years and they are demanding the type of quality stainless equipment that BBRW can produce. I have complete confidence that we will see many shipments of BBRW equipment being shipped to European countries very shortly.

I also followed their CBD process carefully and it is a patent pending cold extraction system capable of making very high grade CBD extract. It is basicly a continuous mix that can run 24/7 if necessary. The cold extraction process does not require chemical solvents or extreme heat to process the CBD thereby producing very high quality extract.
BBRW is here to stay and will continue to grow and earned its place as the next market giant in this industry.""",Bug_Deep,-1,/r/pennystocks/comments/mr40ew/beercbd_pharmaceutical_grade_american_steel_bbrw/guk80fd/,0.033,0.89,0.077,0.8767
