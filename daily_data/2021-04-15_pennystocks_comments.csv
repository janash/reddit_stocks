I appreciate your post and I thank you for taking the time and energy, and putting yourself out there in front of everybody to receive scrutiny.  That takes courage.  Your responding to others is nice to see as well and shows me that you really are passionate with this ticker.

The ticker was being pumped all over twitter from Jan to March at least, so I just wanted to let you know everybody knows about PVDG and it's not a secret, you are not entering before the masses.

I was in it a couple times and bailed because the movement was stagnant, the communication and engagement with the public was little to none, and they were not putting emphasis on getting the Pink current status.

OP, there are other tickers that would be more profitable to you, with lower entry cost and better increase in gains than PVDG.  You said .02 entry? How long has it been at this level? A week, a day, a month?

Someone else said it has 2 billion share structure.  That's not terrible, but not ideal.  I have been in tickers that have 5, 10, 12 billion shares and some have run up fast and hard with profits, so the billion share elephant in the room is not always a terrible thing.  However, companies like to reverse split that to get the share count down and the reverse split is death to your profits and cost basis.  I am in an energy company that did a reverse split and my thousand dollar gain went to negative thousand plus more as soon as they changed out my shares.  14000 shares reduced to 1400 shares and same cost totally took all my gains.  Apparently shareholders voted a year ago for it and I was unaware until it happened basically.  
Watch out for reverse splits.

Not financial advice, but I would not put a lot of money into PVDG, the past pumping, management communication, and potential for RS is too risky.

There are better ones out there, less cost, less shares, better history.

Best of luck to you.",ausernamez001,4,/r/pennystocks/comments/mqshfa/pvdg_poverty_dignified_inc_beeze455_surface/gujx7te/,0.049,0.74,0.211,0.9967

The 3months low for this stock is around 1.02.

The way I see is is if people start to see the link between this and SYSX, it has potential to go up 100% easily. If it doesn't, it drops maximum to 1.02 which is only around -15% from what is it now.

97,RS," No, but as the other user said it’s highly likely.

Reverse splits are generally frowned on as it’s usually an underlying problem with a company if they’re losing stock price and RS in order not to be delisted. If they believed they’d recover share price organically they wouldn’t necessarily worry.

In HITI case they’re diluting to raise funds, and then likely going to RS prior to uplisting to meet the share price requirement. Now it’s not necessarily a bad option, but people are selling up as short term it’s seen as bad for price (see the share price). Depends on what they’re going to use this funding for and what they do when they uplist. You would hope if they uplist they would stop or lessen diluting as that will drive down price when they won’t want to do so at risk of delisting.",Narradisall,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/mr9dji/daily_plays_april_15_2021/gum173c/,0.108,0.765,0.126,0.4556

100,COIN," The whole fake article thing was one of the more bizarre and sketchy things I have seen recently.  Much weirder than just the usual Hindenburg hit piece type deal.  I think AABB has the potential to continue to do well over time as they complete more phases of their plan.  That said, I'm not sure this whole idea is the correct path forward.  If this was some great idea, you'd see it done more frequently.  

Also, it is one thing to pursue actions like ""having Reddit remove claims that you are a money laundering front"" and ""try to find out who published a fake PR in the name of your company that alleged a false merger"".  It is very different to try to sue alleged stock manipulators.  I don't see how anyone gets to the latter from the company saying they are doing the former.  

People are just acting weird in their refusal to be patient and let things play out.  Oh, did the stock go down yesterday?

I look to see what posts they've created, and where (all posts about the same stock/identical posts in every stock sub), what comments they've made (all identical/all mentioning the same stock/nothing but stock subs), and if there are any weird gaps with personality changes (4 years of weight lifting posts, 2 years nothing, suddenly nothing but posts about a single stock).


If you look at my bot stats, I look weird or suspicious.  Account less than six months old with almost 40,000 karma? If you look at my posts and comments, though, you see that I have cute cats, one oddly popular photograph of cheese in a shopping cart, and several comments that went a little cuckoo on the updoots.

126,MRO," You don't understand how market caps/share floats work. You need to do some reading man. MRO had an 8.9b market cap, to make recon's the same right now @ 4.44/share would be a 12.5x or 55/share. Recon could have 100's of billions worth of recoverable oil, meaning the value of that land they control by acre would be immense. Farm out contracts, joint venture and self production will likely jack their market cap up to 25-50b in the next few years. There is a rail nearby, good roads, and a port a few hundred kilometers away at walvis Bay. When you have huge oil assets, getting production going is easy. They will build any infrastructure that they need.

129,TA," $AGYP is a scam. 

\#1 Allied Energy Corp. has not had a SEC filing since 2013 and has not had audited financials and they are doing a promotion type pump to sell their share dilution. 

They are dropping tens of millions of shares on the float. ""As of December 31, 2020, the number of shares outstanding of our Common Stock was: 51,815,458"" [https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/financial-report/274872/content](https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/financial-report/274872/content) (Page 1) 

BUT if you go to their OTC Markets profile you will see    
61,775,458  shares as of  4/12/2021 [https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/AGYP/security](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/AGYP/security)

&#x200B;

That is a + of just under 10 million shares with millions more on their way. Proof? Read below

\#2 This is a share selling scam - more proof on Page 4-12, yes 8 pages worth of convertible notes and debt [https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/financial-report/274872/content](https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/financial-report/274872/content) that may become worth more than the overall market cap soon of the company. 

\#3 Already $2.1 M in liabilities shareholders will have to pay for (Page F-2) 

Still drinking the kool aid? Call the company and ask yourself  858-876-0633  ...oh wait its a fake number that hangs up on you hahaha.

""I have been in the food manufacturing business for many years and I can tell you those systems BBRW makes cost an absolute fortune. The plant I help manage has over 50 $million in stainless equipment just like the ones they make and that is only one plant. They are not limited to only brewing equipment with the skilled crafters they have on staff and they can manufacture equipment for the entire food industry if requested.

Your comment on them using only USA stainless steel is very important. The overseas steel is not of the proper grade and can show stains as well as harbor bacteria as it is of inferior grade. The world market has become very conscious of food safety in the last few years and they are demanding the type of quality stainless equipment that BBRW can produce. I have complete confidence that we will see many shipments of BBRW equipment being shipped to European countries very shortly.

I also followed their CBD process carefully and it is a patent pending cold extraction system capable of making very high grade CBD extract. It is basicly a continuous mix that can run 24/7 if necessary. The cold extraction process does not require chemical solvents or extreme heat to process the CBD thereby producing very high quality extract.
BBRW is here to stay and will continue to grow and earned its place as the next market giant in this industry.""",Bug_Deep,-1,/r/pennystocks/comments/mr40ew/beercbd_pharmaceutical_grade_american_steel_bbrw/guk80fd/,0.033,0.89,0.077,0.8767
