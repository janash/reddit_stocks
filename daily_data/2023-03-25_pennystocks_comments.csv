2,ICE," I did a tour of their facility and test drive of their single seater vehicle a few years ago when I was consulting. They had a cool niche business making cars in Canada mostly by hand and it seemed to be working pretty well for them. 

The solo electric vehicle didn't make any sense to me. It was a single seater electric vehicle, with almost no storage, and even the ones they were planning to produce in China were more expensive than a small 4 seater ICE vehicle (think Chevy Spark, Nissan Micra, etc.) They also had very limited range, and weren't particularly comfortable or fun to drive.

I didn't see the value in the vehicle they were pouring so many resources into. If they scrap the idea of the solo, or pivot and make it an affordable, entry level electric vehicle, then maybe they can turn it around, but if they're still on the track that they were on when I was dealing with them then I don't see a market for their main product.",EyesWideStupid,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/121mupk/anyone_else_been_watching_this_one/jdn2y2a/,0.038,0.897,0.065,0.558
