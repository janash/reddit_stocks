0,LEVI," Background: Yesterday I anticipated a high % surprise earnings call for LEVI, given covid-related changes in weight and thus pants sizes. LEVI has been undervalued and testing the $30 resistance level for some time, and indeed several institutions upgraded its target price to as high as $36-$40 after earnings today. A +7-10% price jump from its weekly high would have brought the stock to $32-33, which I expected would have outweighed the loss from IV crush and brought the ambitious strikes here (expiring next week, not today) into profitability.

Unfortunately, despite a universally positive earnings that described record-setting margins, 150%+ surprise on earnings and a return to pre-covid dividends, the revenue despite being a +5.87% surprise was lower than I anticipated and the caution caused by Delta variant on retailer stocks a more bearish effect than anticipated.

Moving forward, I will think about adjustments to my strategy for earnings plays including using pre-IV crush OTM calls more sparingly in favor of deep low-vega ITM calls.",UnhappyDish8786,550,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oh9zt5/10125_daily_loss/h4o1ngw/,0.101,0.815,0.084,-0.244

15,PT," i’m not gonna laugh or berate you like virtually everyone here. 

PT raises are basically useless. most will say never hold thru earnings and i would agree because it’s never a guarantee to go up - play the run up. earnings *is* the catalyst. after that, there usually isn’t one unless something extravagant (mind you, we are talking about jeans here) is unveiled during the call that says otherwise and entices traders (which are usually the ones jacking up the price, traders are here for a good time not a long time), hence a sell off typically ensues. if you want to make bets with such large amounts of money in the future, *please* go for ITM contracts with time. that way theta doesn’t murder you and intrinsic value somewhat helps salvage some of the loss

also, i would study options more closely, because those strikes are pretty unreasonable. good luck in the future",justawallower,108,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oh9zt5/10125_daily_loss/h4o7r48/,0.098,0.756,0.147,0.7538

Gosh, at least the stock went up a touch along with the positive earnings report though, half the time they don't even do that.
  
  
But I guess it's nice to harness the price movement of 187,800 shares temporarily instead of 1700 or so. I hope you're planning on holding to hit that 30 strike by friday.

26,PLTR," It makes sense in a pretty simple way, though - The less time you have until the date of expiration, the less likely the stock is to move to the strike price before it expires entirely, and so the less it's worth.   
  
I have a PLTR $50 call that expires 1/21/2022, for instance. Now, the $50 strike is pretty far-fetched - so it was relatively cheap to buy, even with such a far-out date, something like $250. In January this year though, PLTR absolutely steamrolled it's way from the mid-20's up to around $38 in a week or two time period. My option, which was worth around $250 when I bought it, was now worth $1353, and with an entire year to spare until it expired.  
  
I held, because *fuck that, let's see this fucker hit $100, I want big boy money*. And now the same option is worth $36 because PLTR has spent the last 6 months piddling around <$20-$25 a share and my 50 strike is looking much more far-fetched than it did in late January. Not that that stopped me from doubling down on my position twiceover since then because emotionally I thought ""*It was worth $1353, $120 is a steal!!*"".  
  
I'm probably 1 for 2 on successful options tbh - but the feeling of making $250-500 from a single position in a day is hard to beat... even if you lost $700 to get there.",nothanksreddit2,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oh9zt5/10125_daily_loss/h4oexcv/,0.049,0.86,0.091,0.6071

74,AAPL," My friend, I urge you to close your position. The risk reward ratio is just not there:

Things to consider:

1. Historically, AAPL rallies after it hits an all time high.
2. There is a LOT of liquidity out there and AAPL is known as a safe blue chip stock a lot of institutional funds buy into.
3. AAPL usually outperforms this time of year and AAPL is lagging the overall market YTD.
4. Although there is antitrust legislation in congress right now, the market doesn't seem to care from last weeks performance so I would not count on this to be a catalyst for you position.
5. Interest rates will likely rise next week from the new CPI data and bank earnings which will likely be a catalyst for stocks, especially big tech like AAPL.

In 1960 the average American *house* was less than 1,000 sq ft (for a family) with no AC in the middle of nowhere with no nearby access to a Wally World or Wendy’s.

Even today 35 m2 apartments are very normal through much of the world to include developed nations in Europe and Asia. It’s common to find two adult human beings living in an apartment less than 400 sq ft (35 m2 = 377 sq ft) 

If you look at entry level wages especially for retail in some flyover shitholes and compare it to desirable metro areas, you’ll sometimes find the VLCOL shit hole areas pay more. How can this be when COL is so much higher in Los Angeles? Well it’s evident that people choose to live in desirable metro areas with shit happening over BFE rural shit hole.

Same with Amazon - its valued based on its proven product.  Tesla is a bit different but is proven to be a leader in its market and the big question is can competition take away share but yes the Elon factor adds a premium.  None of this applies to VG as you decide to pick very large companies to compare against.  In my view VG has a lot to prove before it can be in the same sentence as the companies you mention and for now is fairly valued.

I don’t know if you’ve looked at their projections, but they are projecting 3 million this year in income, probably because they do not intend to take up any passengers.

234,IMO," the thing is that debt is always growing. It can't be any other way as money is created with the promise of being repaid with a premium. 

If things get bad, just print more money, let inflation eat away consumers savings and buying power and make the debt smaller as you now can exchange a loaf of bread for 10 bucks. Now, who gets to survive in a high inflation environment?? commodities, of course with gold and silver faring better than the rest IMO.

239,IRS," Not an expert and not a US citizen, but lets say for instance that the US will not be able to pay its debts, fortunately speaking the US federal budget do have places to cut expenses, such as its oversized defence budget, that alone can accelerate payment on debts and its interest, the good/bad part is that it will depend on the ability on who is cutting what in the defence budget, cause if it was done smartly enough it will not lead to a weaker armed forces nor endanger the industrial relation with the armed forces.

Then you have the unreasonable high price that is being paid for medical care in the US, whether you're in favour or against it, the amount of money that is being paid for medical care have exceeded what is beyond justification, and the number of US citizens that want it implemented similarly to the one that is already working in Canada or in the EU would lead to a huge saving on only for every US citizen, and the national budget, and that option is gaining popularity in the US.

Third, saving money alone would not work, it needs to be accompanied with increased revenue, and here your IRS may need to push the government to legislate against the loopholes were money is being siphoned from, and hire more tax agents to reduce the amount of money that is escaping its control under the current conditions of understaffing.

So the most question that must be answered, if those ideas are viable solutions, are you capable of seeing the US government adopting them even when other ideas will not or can not provide a better outcome!!!",NBelal,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ohmxgg/us_debt_climbing_to_soon_exceed_the_size_of_the/h4qc3rd/,0.044,0.791,0.165,0.9897

281,DD," Interesting perspective. Here's my take.

I think they will continue to keep a large chunk of the streaming market. Yeah it's weird that they haven't been able to turn a profit - but when you have that kind of marketshare (and expect to keep it) you'v got green lights to increase prices and or the option to start slimming down head count to get there. The growth in the ad-driven users is dece @20% for Q1'21 (wondering what this was in the past quarters) and prospects are good that they'll convert those to premium users. Not sure how sustainable this is, but music appeals to an on the go lifestyle too post-covid, so not expecting a Zoom-style pullback from the reopening.

Operating cashflow was alright for the quarter and will improve if and when they execute on the above. No red flags there IMO.

Now for the interesting part as you mention... The use of the proceeds from the unsecured notes!

Surely you wouldn't do that without a plan. The convertible nature is dilutive but only triggers with a big upswing in share price.

I'm genuinely intrigued and do think there's alot hanging on that strategic plan. If it's good, I SERIOUSLY think there's upwards room here, since you've got a cashflow machine that just needs a couple of tweaks in the background that can support the new strategy as it matures. In fact, why can't this reach a Netflix style valuation? (Disclosure, I haven't DD them to compare).

If Netflix can turn into a film studio, Spotify could become a label/talent manager/event manager à la LiveNation type of deal. I could see that - the Joe Rogan signing shows they have promise in securing content. They're latest acquisition screams directly streamed live concerts as well - we'll see where that goes.

Sure Apple's lossless audio is cool, but unless you're a serious audiophile, most probs won't notice unless you've got good headphones (I listen to FLAC and if you're banging tunes from a flipped cell phone like 95 percent of people not in public or using 20 dollar values earbuds, you're not gonna care).

283,IMO," Interesting perspective. Here's my take.

I think they will continue to keep a large chunk of the streaming market. Yeah it's weird that they haven't been able to turn a profit - but when you have that kind of marketshare (and expect to keep it) you'v got green lights to increase prices and or the option to start slimming down head count to get there. The growth in the ad-driven users is dece @20% for Q1'21 (wondering what this was in the past quarters) and prospects are good that they'll convert those to premium users. Not sure how sustainable this is, but music appeals to an on the go lifestyle too post-covid, so not expecting a Zoom-style pullback from the reopening.

Operating cashflow was alright for the quarter and will improve if and when they execute on the above. No red flags there IMO.

Now for the interesting part as you mention... The use of the proceeds from the unsecured notes!

Surely you wouldn't do that without a plan. The convertible nature is dilutive but only triggers with a big upswing in share price.

I'm genuinely intrigued and do think there's alot hanging on that strategic plan. If it's good, I SERIOUSLY think there's upwards room here, since you've got a cashflow machine that just needs a couple of tweaks in the background that can support the new strategy as it matures. In fact, why can't this reach a Netflix style valuation? (Disclosure, I haven't DD them to compare).

If Netflix can turn into a film studio, Spotify could become a label/talent manager/event manager à la LiveNation type of deal. I could see that - the Joe Rogan signing shows they have promise in securing content. They're latest acquisition screams directly streamed live concerts as well - we'll see where that goes.

286,TV," They cannot increase prices if their closest competition (Apple and Amazon) keeps prices down and offers essentially the same product (although arguably better since it has lossless audio quality).

Netflix was so successful because they were able to make quality content (e.g., Crown, House of Cards) and expand quickly into movies with big name directors. Most households would not replace them because of their exclusive content. Making a good TV series can capture peoples attention over the course of years, as people want to see new seasons. In music, you have to constantly innovate and find new and catchy songs, and artists are not going to want to go exclusive unless they are offered quite a bit of money. Spotify should be trying this but they haven’t (at least not successfully), and it’s not guaranteed it would have favorable economics like with series/movies.

In the near term, if you are a Spotify holder, you have to really hope podcasts will take off, as this is where Spotify has aggressively been putting money and is an early mover. But many podcasts artists will opt for wider distribution to get more ad revenue.",estoy_al_pedo,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oh77it/is_there_still_a_bullish_case_for_spotify_time_is/h4nmvx5/,0.029,0.84,0.131,0.9527

300,NC," You, unironically, sound like a communist right now. It has nothing to do with keeping a middle class away from owning real estate, and everything to do with a severe, severe, supply and demand imbalance alongside other trends like higher commodity prices (in the short term), and homebuilders who are okay with waiting until commodity prices decrease so they can increase their margin even more than they have been.

There is no reason to believe prices will come down other than that T2 cities and growing areas of the country like Raleigh NC etcetera have seen bidding wars in highly desirable areas with all cash, as they are able to since they have just sold their homes in places where home prices have also increased and which were worth more.

Interest rates increasing could mean people can afford less house, and decrease demand slightly, but for the next few years demand will outstrip supply and it's not going to be by a small margin until the inventory backlog gets cut through in a meaningful way. They'll also most likely price out people wanting to get their starter homes, since those are the ones most in demand by investors. 

I'm sorry for you and others here, because a lot of people here are conflating my cold analytical calculation of the housing market for both new and old homes with my very human desire to see my fellow American prosper. I do applaud the Biden Administration's attempts to help, but i think structural changes need to be made which can only be done through Congress to boost new home starts. 

Again, this very real misery that people feel about their  perceived (or real!) inability to purchase a home has made them feel emotional in this thread. It's a us vs. them narrative, and anyone who punctures that narrative risks people getting mad at them for stating a simple truth. I've had people who couldn't possibly have read through the thesis (because of time constraints), bash me in the comment section lmao.

304,CCS," Purchase home builder stocks, or calls. I wrote on it before. CCS/M/I have the highest upside due to their really low valuation relative to peers (and for no reason). I've checked, and you can read my DD on it. A lot of home builders will release earnings late july (including my favorite CCS), and you can expect increased guidance. Lennar and KBH homes increased guidance, and i don't see any reason why the trend won't continue. 

Lumber is decreasing at a faster pace than i thought, and there is usually a 60-90 day lag time before you will see the correspondent margin increase (ergo, the home starts using THAT lumber). For that reason, to be safer, you should buy longer dated calls if you want to be more assured of making money.

Home builders have had a huge run in the last year, but are still trading below their historical multiple. Once people realize this is a secular, and not a cyclical trend, you'll see a boom time. Rapid bond rating increases, much lower leverage, and the glimpse of fortress balance sheets have occurred and will continue to occur. This will eventually lead to home builders being assigned a higher multiple. If the markets don't organically assign them one, home builders will force the issue through stock buybacks, dividend raises, or a combination of both.

312,CCS," I'd buy a earnings call on CCS/M/I, but not LGI. Take a look at price to earnings multiples, and future price to earnings multiples for a variety of homebuilders. The sector is poised to boom even further than it has, but it's always better to buy companies that have lower valuations (with the caveat that there's no reason for it) and higher ROE and higher future P/E (growth). 

Their debt looks super safe to me as well, M/I homes was upgraded to the first rung of investment grade, and CCS was upgraded to one step below investment grade with a positive outlook by Moody's. 

I've taken a look at a ton of financial statements for home builders, and especially for these two. Read through earnings calls for Lennar and KBH. If you look here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwtg7n/ccslennar\_like\_good\_god\_ccs\_is\_making\_me\_hot\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwtg7n/ccslennar_like_good_god_ccs_is_making_me_hot_and/)  this was my first of 2 DD's on homebuilders, and I perfectly called the Lennar play. It boomed on Earnings the next day, and then boomed even more the day after. At one point it was up over 10-11% for the week intra-days. 

Penny had the right idea with his KBH call, but (as i explained to him) the wrong stock. KBH was valued at over 12 price to earnings, and so even though they beat earnings by between 10-15% and increased guidance that 2% revenue miss fucking knocked them the fuck down to a price to earnings multiple of 9 or a bit above it which was roughly in line with Lennar. 

I'm not going to keep waxing eloquent about home builders, but you can see the numbers in their financial statements, and you can see my 2 DDs (my most recent one was much more detailed).

Their debt looks super safe to me as well, M/I homes was upgraded to the first rung of investment grade, and CCS was upgraded to one step below investment grade with a positive outlook by Moody's. 

I've taken a look at a ton of financial statements for home builders, and especially for these two. Read through earnings calls for Lennar and KBH. If you look here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwtg7n/ccslennar\_like\_good\_god\_ccs\_is\_making\_me\_hot\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwtg7n/ccslennar_like_good_god_ccs_is_making_me_hot_and/)  this was my first of 2 DD's on homebuilders, and I perfectly called the Lennar play. It boomed on Earnings the next day, and then boomed even more the day after. At one point it was up over 10-11% for the week intra-days. 

Penny had the right idea with his KBH call, but (as i explained to him) the wrong stock. KBH was valued at over 12 price to earnings, and so even though they beat earnings by between 10-15% and increased guidance that 2% revenue miss fucking knocked them the fuck down to a price to earnings multiple of 9 or a bit above it which was roughly in line with Lennar. 

I'm not going to keep waxing eloquent about home builders, but you can see the numbers in their financial statements, and you can see my 2 DDs (my most recent one was much more detailed).

With that said, it's roughly 1.4K. 1.4K for a HOUSE is less than i pay in rent for a 1 BR APT. Lot more space, and likely nicer bedrooms and flooring and kitchen.
