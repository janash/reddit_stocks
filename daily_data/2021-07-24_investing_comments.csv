0,FB," I think all companies and even national economies have a maturity point. Infinite exponential growth is a convenient lie we use to make financial valuations easy to do, but it’s not reality.

That said, I’m still very bullish on US tech megacaps as I believe they are monopolizing enormous markets and really haven’t even started to monetize those opportunities fully.

Just compare ads on FB and YouTube to old media like cable TV for example. Cable has both a massive monthly sub price and enormous amounts of ads on top. All these social media and streaming businesses can squeeze 5x the revenue per user if they monetized as hard as old media does. They are just starting down this path now.

I’m not saying that part is great from a consumer POV, but I think covid hitting during the start of the streaming wars has really normalized a big jump in spending and I expect they will keep squeezing 15-20% revenue growth easily for years to come.",vansterdam_city,12,/r/investing/comments/oqje9y/when_does_a_company_reach_its_full_potential_when/h6c9t6j/,0.046,0.817,0.138,0.9477

2,MSFT," As you alluded to in your post, the real question isn't really if they're going to keep growing (they will), but its if they are going to keep growing at a rate that outpaces the greater economy and whether or not their stock returns will continue to outpace the SP500/Broad indexes. This is where I'd probably say ""no"".

In general, winning stocks of the last decade are almost always losing stocks over the following decade. I don't think there is anything unique about APPL or MSFT to logically conclude that this will eventually not happen to them. Immature/small stocks tend to grow at a faster rate than larger stocks, and APPLE/MSFT are very mature at this point with most of their growth behind them.

MSFT / APPL will be almost certainly be larger than they are now in 10 years, but I would be \*very\* surprised if their stock returns are anything near what they've been in the last 10 years.",MrInsano424,3,/r/investing/comments/oqje9y/when_does_a_company_reach_its_full_potential_when/h6dcra4/,0.017,0.844,0.139,0.9648

4,AAPL," >How realistic is it that these Multi trillion dollar companies like APPL and MSFT, keep growing at the rate they are, in the future?

It's not realistic.  Microsoft has grown 10x in the last ten years.  That probably won't happen again.  It's true that there is no limit to the size of companies.  However, most companies eventually get too top-heavy and overly laden with cash-sucking and useless middle management to continue growing at a high rate.

Likely MSFT, AAPL, AMZN etc will continue to grown in fits and spurts for a few more decades, but not nearly at the rate of the last decade.  New, leaner and more aggressive companies will eat away at their business until growth slows to a crawl.  New trends in society will lead to new companies that will rise and replace them at the top.

60,GM," Long term expectation is they'll lose value as the established car companies catch up. The F150 Lightning is the first real shot across the bow and I expect that truck to outsell Tesla's entire lineup especially when that platform is expanded for lower cost fleet/work vehicles. When GM really steps it up I think they'll own the fleet EV market.

Tesla's long-term strategy will have to revolve around what technologies they can license out. I think charging higher rates for other brands to use the Supercharger network will be a short-term way to make some revenue, but won't last as eventually there will be a political push to standardize charging interfaces (I expect this especially from the EU).

I'm a doofus and I'm trying to time the market by expecting a correction.

Also when credits running dry once electric cars become mainstream. 

 - they stay firm = due to a new line of vehicles, that are able to be mass produced and surpass the big companies (in the public's eye, a la they hold the iphone ish outlook of themselves). they start making huge deals with other manufacturers to provide them batteries while producing solid products themselves that the people want.",DaBombDiggidy,-1,/r/investing/comments/oqsosi/what_do_you_expect_for_tslas_2nd_quarter_update/h6e947z/,0.0,0.923,0.077,0.802

 I don't expect robotaxis until the next generation of hardware. I do think more cameras with higher definition will be required along with even more processing capability and redundancy. I do think they can do it with vision alone since humans can also, but it requires a level of perception they have to create to get there. 

I definitely would not buy FSD on a monthly basis until it's released, but I have zero regrets on purchasing FSD for the $2k lifetime and computer upgrade when I had the chance the other year. I use Enhanced autopilot all the time and my car has driven 190 miles straight on the highway with no steering or braking, along with multiple trips into Dallas during rush hour traffic using navigate on autopilot taking a few highway interchanges. Busy lane change traffic is where I usually take over, but road trips on autopilot is well worth it overall.

They also can't mass produce anything....so it takes much longer than it should to produce a vehicle. Their aftermarket model is also attrocious. Since they don't sell on lots they leave preowned sales to shady auctioneers that let the vehicles rot in private parking structures until they are sold with more problems then ever. You can only operate on hype for so long. Eventually you need to back it up with a product. I've owned a Hyundai EV for about 2 years now and have had ZERO problems.

You can’t scale a dumb autopilot program to full self driving, but an AI doing cruise controls is like a human mind that already understands what the regulations are and how to drive a car and react to different situations.

90,FSD," Here was my reply. I did not use emojis. 

As a Model 3 owner with FSD, I think it will be able to drive people to work for the most part with minimal interventions once they get FSD rolled out to everyone. How soon is definitely longer than 2 weeks, but everyday is one day closer to when it gets released.

I don't expect robotaxis until the next generation of hardware. I do think more cameras with higher definition will be required along with even more processing capability and redundancy. I do think they can do it with vision alone since humans can also, but it requires a level of perception they have to create to get there.

I definitely would not buy FSD on a monthly basis until it's released, but I have zero regrets on purchasing FSD for the $2k lifetime and computer upgrade when I had the chance the other year. I use Enhanced autopilot all the time and my car has driven 190 miles straight on the highway with no steering or braking, along with multiple trips into Dallas during rush hour traffic using navigate on autopilot taking a few highway interchanges. Busy lane change traffic is where I usually take over, but road trips on autopilot is well worth it overall.

I usually have no major issues with autopilot on city streets going through normal street lights, but windy multi lane roads present issues with knowing what lane to be in on some areas. This is still using the previous code for autopilot. FSD is already far more capable than my version already.

Ford cannot secure any batteries so they are being forced to source them from a currently non-existent factory in Georgia.

99,FSD," I don't complain about problems. My car has had no issues in 33k miles and 2.5 years other than some scratches from the shipping carrier that Tesla fixed. The only delivery issue aside from that was a stitching error on the seat which they fixed. I rotate my tires, bought one new set which had a 60% Michelin prorated warranty discount, cleaned and replaced my air filter and add washer fluid as needed. 

It needs no other maintenance otherwise and constantly improves with software updates, but the current update is taking a while to get FSD out which required a fundamental restructuring of the autopilot algorithms to fully utilize the FSD computer. I still consider the FSD hardware upgrade well worth the money even though it's taking a while to release the software.

I pay 9 cents a kwh in Texas so it only costs me around $6.50 to charge my model 3 for around 230 highway miles. I took a trip to North Dallas and started with 300 miles of range, drove mostly on highways from 75-85mph (I am not conservative) and got home with 6 miles left and drove it to 0 miles which hit 232 total miles. Then I plugged in on my 50 amp charger and it took 8 hours and 45 minutes to fully charge overnight. When comparing against my old scion tc I still have, that car costs around $35 to fill up for 280 highway miles. Electricity is 1/5 the cost of gas and I never plan to go back. I will replace both of those vehicles with a cybertruck eventually. It's just far cheaper to drive with electricity.

On the manufacturing issues, it looks like they keep improving with their newer factories. China reportedly has far better quality since they designed the plant around the production line. I view Fremont as an operations nightmare. They are doing the best they can with the facility, but they designed the manufacturing around the building which can lead to far more issues than fine tuned process designed from the ground up.",rideincircles,7,/r/investing/comments/oqsosi/what_do_you_expect_for_tslas_2nd_quarter_update/h6e7t5x/,0.019,0.896,0.085,0.9739

There is an index I want to track however no UK broker offers access to the ETF that currently exists which tracks this index.  
  
I reckon I would be able to self-create the index (at the correct %) but I am loathe to go through and place over 200 separate trades unless I have to do that. I would have to monitor these monthly I assume to ensure they matched the index but realistically I would stick to a six month balancing cycle.

142,MSCI," Hello,

At the moment I'm investing in  NN Enhanced Index Sustainable Equity Fund (ISIN: NL0012125736).
It is actively managed (0.17% fee) but it tracks the MSCI World (NR) index.

The only difference for the fund is that it excludes certain companies (weapons, tobacco) so the focus is on sustainable.

I read a lot on the negatives on actively managed funds. But I think most of those arguments don't hold true to this fund. Since it still follows the index but it excludes companies I don't want to invest in anyways. How do you guys see this?",ICT_Guy,1,/r/investing/comments/oqmf1e/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h6cn5of/,0.082,0.847,0.071,-0.2562
143,TD," A few quick points:

Roth IRA is the ultimate savings account for low wealth savers. You can withdraw contributions at any time without penalty. The catch is you can't replace it, you can only continue with future contributions at the annual limit. This makes withdrawing from a Roth IRA painful for high wealth savers because they want to have large IRA balances, but if your alternative is a taxable brokerage account, a bank account, etc. and you otherwise wouldn't contribute to a Roth IRA, you're leaving money on the table. If you never need to withdraw it, awesome, you have a retirement account to hold onto and never pay tax on again. If you do need to withdraw, great, no penalty as long as you don't start withdrawing earnings. It's win-win compared to your alternatives.

401k and IRA are comparable things -- accounts. Traditional and Roth are comparable concepts -- tax treatments. Traditional/Roth are adjectives, not nouns. You could roll a traditional 401k into a traditional IRA and it is basically the same thing, but now you control it. Separately, you can roll a traditional 401k into a Roth IRA, but this is a conversion and the amount that you convert becomes ordinary taxable income in the year you do the conversion. It is often advantageous to do a conversion like this in a year you have low income, since your taxes will be low and now it's Roth going forward (no more taxes on this account ever again).

Stay away from Robinhood entirely. They have literally no advantages over larger, established brokerages like Schwab (and its now subsidiary TD Ameritrade) and Fidelity. Robinhood may have been the catalyst that made larger brokerages offer things like free trades, but as it stands today there's no longer a reason to use Robinhood at all.",hydrocyanide,2,/r/investing/comments/oqmf1e/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h6dvlww/,0.052,0.815,0.133,0.9809

149,BAC," This is what I'm seeing: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lot.asp

> Options
In terms of options, a lot represents the number of contracts contained in one derivative security. One equity option contract represents 100 underlying shares of a company’s stock. In other words, the lot for one options contract is 100 shares.
> 
> For example, an options trader purchased one Bank of America (BAC) call option last month. The option has a strike price of $24.50 and expires this month. If the options-holder exercises their call option today when the underlying stock, BAC, is trading at $26.15, they can purchase 100 shares of BAC at the strike price of $24.50. One option contract gives them the right to purchase the lot of 100 shares at the agreed strike price.
> 
> With such standardization, investors always know exactly how many units they are buying with each contract and can easily assess what price per unit they are paying. Without such standardization, valuing and trading options would be needlessly cumbersome and time-consuming.
> 
> Typically, the smallest options trade an investor can make is for one contract, and that represents 100 shares. However, it is possible to trade options for a smaller amount with mini-stock options which have an underlying share amount of 10.3
