85,GME," Exercise / breakeven are about the same thing usually... unless the underlying assets would cost you a fortune to exercise (like in this case).

OP has 39 contracts of 100 shares each at a strike price of $300. (39 x 100 x 300)

He will need $1,170,000 to exercise all of these. So you're likely correct in that their goal is to sell them ITM for a profit. Which means GME has to go well above $315 for this retarded endeavour to be worth it.",StreetTripleRider,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nhbxy0/new_home_or_homeless/gyxy82r/,0.066,0.812,0.122,0.4451
86,GME," You are correct. He probably shouldn't have said ""shares"" because ""shares"" usually refers to stock, not options. $9.25 is indeed the current premium, ie the current price of the call options (quoted on a per/share basis, even though each contract is actually for 100 shares of the stock).

So basically, today, you could buy the same option contract (same strike and expiration date) for $9.25 that he paid $15 a while back. So why has premium (option price) gone down? For an OTM option, there's a few reasons:

1) Stock Price: the stock price hasn't moved up substantially. Obviously the closer it gets to $300 (or above), the more likely his call is to end ITM.

2) Time Decay: Time is ticking away. For an OTM contract, the more time remaining before expiration, the higher the chances are that the share price will make its way into the money before expiration. Think of it this way: what are the odds GME breaks $300 in the next day? Not good. What are the odds it breaks $300 during the next 5 days? Not good, but definitely higher. Maybe even 5 times higher? What are the odds it breaks $300 in the next 100 days? Definitely higher still (although probably still low). So the longer the time remaining on an option, the more likely the stock price will move before expiration, because it has more time available to move. Thus, as time ticks away, if the stock price isn't moving favorably (such as staying flat), then the value of the option is going to decrease. You can see this in the options chain. Options with expirations that are further out have higher premiums (more expensive).

3) Expected/implied volatility: If an option is currently OTM, the odds of it going ITM is also a function of the expected amount of volatility in the stock price. A stock price that is wildly bouncing all over the place certainly has a higher likelihood of moving far enough to get ITM than a steady stable boring stock price. The steady stable boring stock price is most likely to just stay where it's at (OTM in this case) and thus expire OTM (worthless). So, expected volatility affects premiums. So, if he bought the OTM calls when volatility was high, he paid a higher premium because that volatility increased the chances of his calls ending ITM. So now, if GME had flatlined and shows no signs of big moves in either direction, that will hurt the value of his options. On the other hand, if news leaked that a big board announcement is coming up, or perhaps an earnings release is coming up, or suddenly GME starts getting more attention again and the stock gets a lot more volatile, those would all increase expected volatility, which would cause his options to rise in value, since now there is a higher likelihood of a big stock price move that could put his options ITM before expiration.

So there you have it:
1) stock price relative to strike
2) time remaining until expiration
3) expected volatility

Changes in any of those will change the value of his calls.",Dubs13151,10,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nhbxy0/new_home_or_homeless/gywzaon/,0.054,0.87,0.076,0.9208

If you think about the math it would have told you this was a bad play to hold that long. If I buy your option right now, for 60 bucks, I'm out 6,000 and the price difference at the moment is 4,000. I'd lose 2k unless it dropped further. There's still some time value to try and make some profit but since this stock keeps trading sideways for weeks with some spikes up, it's a losing proposition for me.

Now cheap FDs for intraday scalps.... risky as fuck but more likely to print some money over yours.

I would sell that thing for a loss and put that 6,000 to work making money back.

I speak from experience. I ate a 8,000 loss on GME... but the 16,000 I got out of it I scalped GME for 4k and now have it elsewhere that is up 12,000. So I'm double profit what my loss was. Worst part is I could have easily quadrupled profit had I bit the bullet earlier and put my money to work. 

Oh well, I was stubborn because my position was actually a money maker it just tied my capital up for a long fucking time unless I ate a loss. Instead of losing 8k I'd be up a good 36,000... instead I'm only up 16.

302,LNG," There are some ways it's being used in a less damaging way, for instance converting coal plants to LNG. If every step in the supply chain is managed ethically (extraction, transport and eventual use), it can be significantly cleaner than the plant would have otherwise been.

Yup, it's still fossil fuels so it's not green but the grid can't reliably run 24/7/365'ish on renewables alone at this point. Large scale battery deployments would be a game changer in smoothing out renewables' ability to become primary sources for our grid (in the US at least) by filling in demand gaps when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing.

2. Peacock offers a free add supported service and a premium version for 4.99 and 9.99 a month. Peacock will be basically free for comcast to run and basically is all profit after they exit growth mode.
3. You can buy a subscription through infinity or comcast broadband/wireless to Nflx,Hulu, Prime, Hbomax, Showtime, a Starz etc. Etc.etc. so comcast wins either way because they take a cut out of all those business.

Doesn't really matter if Tesla uses lidar anyway since they don't drive much sales volume. What matters are the bigger manufacturers who are ramping up EV efforts and more interested in lidar.

542,AAPL," I have a IBKR and Schwab account and here are my observations:

Things that bother me with Schwab:

1. Higher options trading level approval is pain in the ass 
2. Margin rate is much higher
3. Pre/after hours market is not open for the whole duration, rather \~2h pre/post market
4. Street Smart Edge is unnecessarily complicated and slow to use. Besides, you can't trade all instruments in it - Futures can only be traded in Street Smart Central via browser. Although IBKR's TWS looks archaic, I find it more streamlined and faster in use.
5. You have to set up separate trades to buy/sell during regular and extended trading sessions (In IBKR you can tick the ""include extended hours"" box). This one is really annoying - for example, I want a GTC order to buy AAPL at $100. I don't care if it will be executed during standard trading session or after hours or tomorrow morning - I just want it bought (or sold) at a particular price. That's impossible to do with Schwab. You have to set it up separately for each and every extended hours trading. Super annoying.
6. Pre/post market is unavailable for 5 mins just before or just after standard trading session. There's no such 5 min break with IBKR. Super annoying.
7. Standard margin requirement for holding particular shares is 30%. If I sell cash covered put, it will require 100% margin. If put gets executed, and I'm assigned shares, the required margin will again be 30%. I guess this has something to do with your option level approval but I don't see why higher options approval level changes the basic math. Very illogical and super super annoying.

Good things with Schwab (comparing with IBKR):

1. Zero fee shares trading
2. Schwab zero fees debit card
3. Support is generally more knowledgeable and accommodating. IBKR has a great support as well only if you get a US customer service representative. The problem is most of the times you'll get Indian with poor knowledge of the products.

They are entering the EV market with no advantages.  No battery cost advantage, no pricing advantage, no performance advantage, no charging advantage, no production cost advantage.

Go on Autotrader and look at all the Mach-E's available.  Hundreds in my area.  They aren't selling out, because Mustang buyers buy V8 Mustangs.

Ford and GM service centers will have issues with less maintance but companies are pushing to subscription type service on vehicles or fleets to make up the costs.

What Ford and GM are doing is getting into the market before Tesla fully takes it over.

643,VS," You learn by learning about them, not buy panicking as your money inexplicably bleeds out of your portfolio on an option you thought would profitable. Investopedia has all the information you need. If you need more the book 'understanding options' is basically options for dummies.

They aren't super complicated but the concepts can seem pretty foreign at first and take a while to wrap your head around, but once you start to get it they are pretty intuitive. 

Here's a short list of questions you should be able to answer before you start trading options.

1. What is the difference between a Call and a Put

2. What are the potential benefits of buying a call VS buying shares. What are the risks?

3. What are the potential benefits to selling Covered calls on the shares you already own? What are the potential downsides.

4. What are the two main uses for buying Puts?

5. What does it mean to sell a cash secured put? What are the pros/cons of doing so?

690,AMD," Idiots in this thread, Jesus. Shortage issues? AMDs market share gains have slowed down due to shortages, they're selling every chip they can make.

When supply catches up to demand (which isn't happening for another year at least), their sheets will still look great because they'll start chipping away at Intel and Nvidias market share. With the Xilinx merger they'll become the largest customer at TSMC. As they start transitioning to 5 nm, they'll be able to allocate 7nm to lower margin GPU products, a segment which is currently neglected due to shortages, both by Nvidia and AMD.

Besides that, they just announced a $4b share buyback. AMD have never had this kind of free cash before. This is going to prevent any sub $70 targets, unless there's a very sudden macro cause, and even then they'll eat it up because they want to buy the shares at a decent price. The reason they're doing share buybacks and not investing in the company? They have no factories, so they don't need capital to increase production levels. They've already effectively maxed out on R&D, and as Intel have proven over the last 4 years, you can't throw extra money at semiconductor R&D to get better results.

Their product roadmap for the next 5 years is amazing and they have a proven track record of delivering.

They said themselves that their gpu lineup should get another 50%+ per/watt improvement next gen, and leakers who have been pretty reliable previously are pointing to much higher numbers.

In the CPU space, Intel's next two generations are no threat whatsoever, and AMDs iterative design approach means consistent gains in performance and power consumption every year. Intel's 10nm laptop CPUs can increase their performance by 10% for a 50% power consumption tradeoff. It proves how bad the state of their foundries really is.

The Xilinx merger is a big brain play if it goes through, which it should. It gives them the FPGAs necessary to chip away at Nvidias monopoly on machine learning. Xilinx already easily outperforms Nvidia here, but Nvidia has an ecosystem that needs to be broken. As we move towards smaller processing nodes, transistor size reductions will no longer be the way to get better performance. A mix of FPGAs, ASICs, and general compute units is the future. That's what AMD have recognised and why they're building an arsenal of integrated CPU and GPU products now. They're building the experience required to meet the demands of the future.

I don't have much money so I've got 265 shares via CFDs on 5x leverage. Assuming the Xilinx merger is successful, $100-130 EOY is easily manageable imo. It will likely take a hit after the merger as Xilinx owners sell their converted shares, but that's to be expected. With the guidance AMD have for this year it's also plausible they may increase the buyback program depending on demand/shortages, which could alleviate Xilinx sellers.",Edhellas,15,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nhx6hu/amd_100_by_end_of_year/gyyvyvd/,0.046,0.845,0.109,0.9789

At $65k/yr/patient in revenue they will need about 3000 patients to break even by then. In Q1 they were able to get 250 new patient signups, if they get 250 new patients each quarter and those patients use the drug for 3 years (FDA approval guidance was for 1 year!) they will NEVER make $50mm/qtr.

805,DD," Something to add to your DD.

I am sure it will run because people are fucking crazy, but the following is to keep in mind because correction will come, without a doubt, when common sense (ie fundamentals) kicks in:

Right before the pandemic was declared, they had 685M shares outstanding; the current number is at about 1,200M. Those shares were trading at $51.9 per share at its peak; today they closed at $27.53. That provides a market cap of $35.55B at the peak before the pandemic and $33.04B currently.

At the same time, long-term debt increased from $12.94B to $31.33B. Cash on hand as at Feb 28 was $11.51B, up from $9.51B. That provides the enterprise value of $38.98 before the hit and $52.86B currently. This is a very rough calculation and some numbers may be slightly different, but it isn‚Äôt far off.

So, while they lost $11.43B last year (and made about $3B the year before), market cap hasn‚Äôt significantly changed and enterprise value rose by a whooping $14B! Pretty sure everyone in their right mind understands that this is fucking insane.

This does not take into account that they will still be burning cash for the next few months, at least; and thus, issuing more shares or assuming more debt. Income prospects are also questionable for the foreseeable future for obvious reasons. For example, RCL‚Äôs CEO was talking about ‚Äúfavourable bookings‚Äù for 2022 (!). That was on the earnings call a couple of months ago (if I recall correctly).

Then add the green regulations that will come rather sooner than later since there were talks about it in not such a distant past and the current environmental concerns of the decision makers. That will require additional capital, which leads to more dilution and/or higher debt.

What I am saying is that it isn‚Äôt even remotely as bright as people are assuming it to be. Keep in mind that what I wrote above is really just the stuff on the surface and there is more shit to scratch. When the real market correction comes, cruise liners will be taking one of the biggest hits. When that correction comes is up for debate (not in the next few months, in my opinion, but I was wrong before). You should also keep in mind that they can dilute at any time and the last time they did was at the end of February; so we may be about due for another one, maybe not. Their next earnings call is on July 9, so that dilution may come before or right after, or not at all.
