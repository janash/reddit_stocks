12,AMZN," If you build a single store on Shopify you will instantly know why Shopify will be one of the biggest companies in the world 10 years from now. No one does it better, no one does it close. Their competitive advantage is in having the most superior product and services.

Shopify's customer base is rapidly growing, but more importantly the revenue from those customers is also growing due to the growth of their customer's businesses.  Think of Netflix for example, they need to grow their user base to see growth in their overall revenue or they have to up the price of services.  Shopify could fail to grow users (just an example) and not increase their cost of services and still have drastic revenue growth, because so long as their customers grow, they grow.

However, since their customer base is rapidly growing and their customer's businesses are growing as well, and shopify is introducing more value-added services to further monetize, I think the growth trajectory is becoming exponential. Their P/E ratio is indeed high, but you commonly get that with all companies transitioning from not being profitable to being profitable. A company can have 1 billion in revenue but not be profitable and no one seems to care because there's no high P/E visible. But once the company transitions to profitability the PE can be very high for 1-2 years.

If a company has been profitable for 1 year, I don't personally think PE is a very useful metric.  But I do find it to be useful on mature companies with at least 5 years of profitability.

Shopify is my 2nd biggest portfolio position behind AMZN.  I also use Shopify.  After using it for the the first time I instantly though ""I need to invest in this company"".",FunkyFlamchango,8,/r/investing/comments/n117k6/shopify_earnings_report_q1/gwavkjw/,0.083,0.752,0.165,0.9771
13,API," There are (literally) a million businesses subscribing to Shopify's services that transact close to 200 billion in sales. They provide a complete end to end solution for a business to sell, fulfill and communicate with customers about the goods they purchased.

> you want to make anything that falls outside of the purview of the traditional payment/subscription for something in return, what do you choose? -> stripe

Ok? So if you aren't looking to open an ecommerce store, you won't choose Shopify?

Stripe and Shopify are not competitors. Shopify Payments literally uses Stripe.

> Why risk your portfolio on shopify when they don't have a moat on payment systems

Shopify charges transaction fees for every transaction that processes through someone's shopify store.

> Don't tell me shopify's moat is its plugins, no code is getting started and disrupting that plugin atmosphere.

What does this even mean? Shopify has a very active add-on/plugin marketplace. It's APIs are extensive and allow developers to create a ton of apps. (An argument against Shopify is that core features you'd expect to see in an ecommerce platform are often third plugins rather than built in, like multibox or variable box sized shipping for example.)

> Don't tell me shopify's moat is its partnership with facebook, zuckerberg literally said yesterday that they're building out their own payment systems to replace shopify

Not sure what this means either. Shopify can integrate with Facebook via their sales channels feature. They don't provide ecommerce functionality for facebook.

Facebook could theoretically deny Shopify API access but that is probably unlikely due to all the anti-trust scrutiny.

A key feature of Shopify is that you can have an ecommerce store -  also sell on facebook, amazon, etsy, ebay AND have that all managed through Shopify.

Overall, I think you are creating false equivalencies about Shopify's core business then listing really successful companies that are somewhat tangent to it and declaring Shopify a non-starter.",cambrianentropy,4,/r/investing/comments/n117k6/shopify_earnings_report_q1/gwaxmy2/,0.03,0.895,0.075,0.9315

20,GDP," Good morning contrarians!

Futures are pointing higher this morning. Tech stocks are leading the way, with the Nasdaq up 1%. Small caps and S&P 500 are 0.7% higher. Dow Industrials pointing to a gain of 0.4%. That’s as of 0630.

Earnings appear to be one driver here, after Facebook, Apple, and Qualcomm blew away estimates yesterday. Some good news on the reopening front, with the CDC saying cruise ships can begin their voyages again in July.

Many more earnings on tap today: Altria, Caterpillar, Northrop Grumman, McDonald’s, Mastercard, and Merck before or during market hours. Amazon and Twitter after the close. That’s just the highlights and some of the bigger names.

On the economic data front we have initial jobless claims at 0830. Those have been trending in the right direction, though estimates are for the number to come in roughly equal to last week (530k or so). You’ll be hearing a lot about the GDP report but that is backward-looking and not of particular interest to me.

Yesterday we had the Fed say and do just about everything that was anticipated. Markets still didn’t like it, for whatever reason. Maybe because Powell finally acknowledged things were ‘frothy’ in capital markets. But the Fed remains accommodative, and the federal government is coming in with even more stimulus. Hard to see how this will not result in risk assets moving higher, especially with earnings continuing to beat estimates.

I'm from the UK and have saved around £100,000 after making a really big risk on gme.

I intend to max this out every year from now on until I buy a house, it must be used for this purpose or retiring and I don't want to use it for retirement.

What should I invest in with this sum for say 5 years from now? I want to turn it into a really strong deposit and I know most of it will be from my own contributions/ the government but obviously I want growth.

I am either thinking VUSA or VHYL 

My worry with vusa is that we are at market Peak and I don't know what will happen with inflation soon.

My worry with vhyl is that the growth won't be so great but I would reinvest all dividends and get something at least as dividends were consistent through last year despite covid.

61,OR," I was told by AutoMod that this belongs here. Hopefully someone can help. I'm pasting my attempted original post here:

&#x200B;

I've got a couple of stocks I'm in right now expected to jump in target price within the coming months. My question is kind of complicated, at least I think so, and I'm not really sure why I can't wrap my head around it.

I use WeBull to invest and research stocks, and when I'm looking at their desktop application, I see that I'm able to set sell orders based on Order Type, Quantity, Limit Price (if applicable), TIF, and then add Stop-Loss and Take Profit to the order if necessary. 

So, say I want to sell 100 shares of Stock for $10, IF the stock reaches $10. But, in the event the stock goes up to $12 in value, I would rather sell at that price point. I would also like to protect my profit in the opposite way, by ensuring that if the stock doesn't quite reach $10, that it sells at $9 instead. How would I go about properly setting this up in WeBull?

My thought process is below -- help me clear things up if you can. 

* I think that I should set a Sell order, with the Limit order type at the limit price of $10, Good 'til cancelled.
* I then should set a Stop-Loss Stop Price @ $12 to ensure that I don't lose profit if the stock does make it to $12 -- this would make my Limit Price become $12, I think.
* I should also add a Take-Profit Limit Price to the order to ensure I gain at least a bit of profit at a $9 sell point.
* With this setup, the order SHOULD execute at $12 if the stock price reaches $12, or it should execute at $10 if the stock reaches anywhere from $11.99 to $10.00, OR it should execute at $9 if the stock rises from market price to $9, but then begins to drop.

I just don't want to mess up and configure the order the wrong way. Of course, I recognize that many commenters will not be licensed financial advisors and that I shouldn't take their advice, but if I do it is of my own free will. I have tried reading on the subject of stop-loss and take-profit and all these order types, but they only confuse me further.

64,EDIT," >I mentally threat these instruments along with social security as bonds.

I guess I understand treating SS/pension as ""bond-like"" (a more guaranteed source of money) but it's a bit of a shaky comparison.

>Ive back tested all country ex US indicies and found no 5-10 year period where they outperformed. Do you have any data that Is contrary?

Where what outperformed? Bonds? And by what metric, total return? Again, bonds aren't about raw return, they're about stabilizing your portfolio. You keep talking about testing but I don't know *what* you're testing.

EDIT - As a simple gut-check, Vanguard's 2035 target date (i.e., targeting a retirement date roughly 15 years out, like you) [is about 25% bonds right now](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTTHX). And, moreover, you're [squarely in the transition period of their glide path](https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/investments/TargetDate), sliding more and more towards bonds with each passing year.

Their strategy may well be overly conservative: they seem to target roughly 50/50 by the target date and as low as ~25/75 by ""late retirement"". Meanwhile, [historical results of the Trinity Study](https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadepfau/2018/01/16/the-trinity-study-and-portfolio-success-rates-updated-to-2018/?sh=2119a0a68606) certainly suggest that you can (at least historically) maintain higher equity levels at a 3-4% withdrawal rate consistently.

NIO is doing great. But it's not eclipsing the competition. You can think of total car market as a pie and the more players are sharing the market share pie the less there is for a single company. EV manufacturing is getting very crowded so that's another downward force on NIO market valuation.
