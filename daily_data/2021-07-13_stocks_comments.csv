17,KO," With pleasure! If we only look at growth (and both company’s dividend on Nasdaq (on mobile, sorry)), just there you can see that PEP’s growth is vastly superior than KO’s growth is, and l don’t mean vastly lightly, Pepsi’s dividends increased by a whole 5% this year alone and is going to keep on growing, while Coca-cola’s was only of a steady 2% (steady as in, it augments every year consistently).

Now onto sustainability, Coca-cola owns the following brands ; Coca-Cola, Sprite, Barq’s, Smartwater, Vitamine Water, Dasani, Fresca Sparkling water, Simply, Minute Maid, Five Alive, Fruitopia, Fairlife, Core power, Nestea, Peace Tea, Gold peak Tea and poweraid to name a few, in total there are ~500 brands partially or totally owned by Coca-Cola.

Pepsi owns a much smaller sum, here it is ; Pepsi, frite-o’lays (or LAYS for simplicity’s sake), Mountain Dew, Doritos, Gatorade, Quaker, Starbucks Bottled Frappuccino (Not Starbucks), Ruffles, Cheetos, Brisk, Tostitos, Fritos, Mirinda, SodaStream and Lipton to name a few. The list does not stop there but these are just the most popular ones, and they are MUCH heavier than the ones Coca-cola have despite being fewer in number. 

Now what are the odds of everyone on earth getting tired of soft-drinks? Pretty unlikely, but if it happened, Coca-cola would be absolutely ruined while it would make a very small dent in Pepsi’s business, why you ask? Because the majority of their revenue come from their food division, Particularly LAYS (Source: Employee that used to work there, he also said “they could drop the Pepsi drink and they’d be just fine”).

Pepsi’s financials are also much stronger than Coca’s with a whopping 70.37 billions in 2020, while Coca-cola had less than half at 33.01 billions in 2020 despite owning 4x the brands that Pepsi has.

Those are the reasons why l will always chose PEP over KO in the stock market and as a company.",Hanshanot,8,/r/stocks/comments/ojdg20/pepsico_raises_forecast_after_earnings_crush/h529wb0/,0.038,0.857,0.106,0.9397

19,AI," > Nah I just worked for them through the CCE->CCR switch and the CCR breakup and watched how the bottlers began to fall apart. All they did was hike materials costs to bottlers to ""beat earnings"" and all the restaurants that re-opened their fountains had to replace expired BiBs from being shutdown. BiBs are incredibly profitable for not only bottlers but KO themselves. KO is only as strong as it's customers, the bottlers. Bottlers are moving more and more toward automation in not just physical labor but programming AI to regulate inventory which is going over terribly from a logistic and ethical standpoint. They are likely going to weaken and drive the independent bottlers into the ground so they can consolidate again but that seems more like a 5-10 year plan.

Quote from another comment of mine. Compared to Pepsi, Coke is kind of a dumpster fire right now with KO acting like a vulture over it's independent and private bottlers.

Any boost in earnings from re-equipping restaurants will be gone not to return. KO's support for bottlers has gotten pretty bad. They give them almost nothing and expect bottlers to pay hiked prices in return which then hurts the bottlers' bottom line which makes it worse for the workforce which forces experienced people to leave so fast they can't train new personnel for a niche job that required knowledge of the development of a specific market over the past decade to thrive.

You get left with personnel with tenure who haven't regularly been boots on the ground in 7-10 years and dumbass burnouts working jobs that used to pay 90k that now pay the same as a head cashier at a gas station. Bottler compliancy to KO standards is flying out the window. I watched an RD truck at a gas station today take 2 hours to do one stop that should have been done in under 45 minutes. It's ridiculous.

KO also has no current interest or the capital to buy back their CCR holdings or they're trying to devalue them so hard that they indys almost go out of business.

Not to mention on top of all of this, core sparkling HFCS, the core of any bottler's and KO's income, is still down 2% YoY. Sure they can come up with a ton of sugar substitute and still innovation but HFCS sparkling pays the bills still primarily. It's just so under diversified compared to the Peppybois.

You don't see Pepsi shooting 10 lifewater or gatorade flavors out their ass. There's not enough money in the category. KO had the AHA relaunch go for it with the goal of 50%-100% over the PY sales... but it was OOS down to 2/9 flavors for so far almost half it's existence due to can shortages so no fucking shit will it 100%. KO bottlers also still have major supply issues in some places, including $COKE, one of the publicly owned bottlers which $KO still holds a stake in.

I'm glad I'm out of the business because anyone still in a DC/PC/SC there is on the wrong side of operations going forward.",Tacoman404,5,/r/stocks/comments/ojdg20/pepsico_raises_forecast_after_earnings_crush/h522j3x/,0.124,0.788,0.088,-0.963

37,GDP," Valuation data is exactly how you determine whether a market is overvalued or not. If you’re investing purely based off economic data that is unrelated to market valuations then you can quite literally justify buying at any price as long as you think the economy is fine. If that’s your view on the market, that overvaluation doesn’t exist if economic data is fine, then so be it. 

Regardless, if you look at the actual economic data from the past year, it’s not good at all yet the market skyrocketed. The market made massive gains even compared to pre-Covid levels despite declining GDP, high unemployment, and heavy restrictions on entire sectors of the economy. Of course this data is improving now but in general we’re still not at pre-COVID levels and tons of people are still out of work.

38,GDP," >Valuation data is exactly how you determine whether a market is overvalued or not.

Valuation data is widely known on both a day to day basis and on a minute to minute basis. Any valuation calls that don't come with supporting data points will not be acted upon.

>If you’re investing purely based off economic data that is unrelated to market valuations then you can quite literally justify buying at any price as long as you think the economy is fine.

Do you not know what an example is? You've extrapolated my example of economic data as a data point as economic data is the only information I look at. This is a mental error known as generalization.

>Regardless, if you look at the actual economic data from the past year, it’s not good at all yet the market skyrocketed. The market made massive gains even compared to pre-Covid levels despite declining GDP, high unemployment, and heavy restrictions on entire sectors of the economy. 

Investment markets are forward looking. Looking back at data from last year is not as helpful as the trend line this year in evaluating where the economy and financial markets will be next year. Projections are made and either supported or denied by new data points.

> Of course this data is improving now but in general we’re still not at pre-COVID levels and tons of people are still out of work. Maybe we’re in a new paradigm where valuations don’t matter and annual gains of 30% with no pullback are the norm regardless of the economic situation.

Tons of people are still out of work and still receiving unemployment benefits and there are tons of jobs to be had when those benefits expire. There will be pullbacks. But they will come on data points, not valuation calls. And a crash this close to the last one in March of last year would be unprecedented. So if you are extrapolating unprecedented events as the norm, then you might as well extrapolate the continued bull market because it is supported by current data points.",iKickdaBass,1,/r/stocks/comments/ojeore/june_cpi_has_been_released_up_54_year_over_year/h52u0ko/,0.058,0.878,0.064,0.3134

I just think the idea and the way it was / is implemented has outlived its validity. 

I am ok with the idea of large block trades being conducted via external markets. for me its like changing the name on a house deed. of course thats not done via a public trade forum.

BUT it needs better regulation and much more transparency. and retail trades shouldn´t be allowed to be ""hoarded"" and sold of as block trades only to be able to be routed through those back channels. 

e.g.: I f I want to buy a security at the NYSE, I want my order to be executed at the NYSE for the exact price I can see when I buy OR the limit I set.

177,EFT," According to the IRS, it’s considered a “wash sale” if you bought a ""substantially identical security"" although that phrase is not specifically defined and is left up to the individual or the broker to decide (my understanding).  I took that to believe that if the EFT follows and is weighted per the same index, it could be considered “substantially identical” (my interpretation of the phrase in order to be safe).

A couple examples and my belief between a couple popular funds an my thinking.

* VOOG (S&P 500 Growth Index) vs QQQ (NASDAQ 100 index) = not a wash sale because of two different indexes but the major holdings are pretty close so could be used for a substitute in a pinch while the 30 days passed.
* QQQ vs QQQM = wash sale (both NASDAQ 100).
* VOO vs SPY = wash sale (both S&P 500).

Again, that was my interpretation of “substantially identical.”  After looking a bit more I read the following which changed my understanding and even used the exact comparison that the OP mentioned.

*""For example, if an investor sells the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) at a loss, they can immediately turn around and purchase the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF. Tax-loss harvesting has become increasingly popular as algorithmic trading and investment management services such as robo-advisors are able to tax loss harvest on your behalf automatically.*

*The rationale is that the two S&P 500 ETFs have different fund managers, different expense ratios, may replicate the underlying index using a different methodology, and may have different levels of liquidity in the market. Presently, the IRS does not deem this type of transaction as involving substantially identical securities and so it is allowed, although this may be subject to change in the future as the practice becomes more widespread.""*  [Source](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/substantiallyidenticalsecurity.asp)

Also, if the IRS suspects you gave your assets away for tax reasons, and they suspect that the transfer is only on paper, that would generally lead to you being investigated for tax evasion.

Your friends ""friend"" who is a ""trader""....what does he do for a living - no not just being a ""trader"".  What is his full-time job?  Can you verify that?  Is he an insider with one company and only trades in that stock only?   If he works in the stock market the ""trader"" may be privy to insider information which he is passing on to your friend.   If so, that is a potentially a bad thing involving jail time, becoming a felon, etc.

Have to ask yourself why does a ""trader"" want to pass tips ""...where the trader basically tells him exactly when, where and how much to buy and sell, and they split the profit 70/30 (30 going to the trader).""  Why doesn't the ""trader"" just use his own money to execute the trades?  What is he afraid of?  Why involve others in his money-making scheme?  Maybe because he is trying to hide his activity from his employer or the SEC.   

Now let us go one step further.  Your friend has told you of this marvelous opportunity to make virtually free money that is extremely likely to lead to jail and fines.  Such a deal.  How many other friends has he told this to?   What is his motivation? Why is he not keeping this secret to himself?   Is he involving other friends in this scheme to rake more money off (paying the trader only 20-25% & pocketing the difference)?  A secret is only as good as its' weakest link.  A weak link (that you do not know) will be the downfall of this scheme.   And you, more than likely, cannot afford the time and money that the lawyers that Martha Stewart used to try & keep her out of jail.  She went to jail anyway just for this style of scheme.
