Partnership with Apple co founder Steve Wozniak and his education company WozEd

Partnership with AgEagle (UAVS) through Micasense

Partnership with cold chain distribution who works with big pharma companies for vaccine distribution

121,APHA," APHA is a great example imo. It shot up from $15 to $32 overnight.  Then paper hands/institutional investors cashed out, causing it to tank *hard* over night for no fundamental reason.  It climbed back up and stayed at around $18/20 for weeks, then the blood bath happened. It held strong around $17/18-ish for days. Then dropped to $14-ish on Friday. I bought more at $14.80 because I love mj stocks and the upcoming merger with Tilray is gonna send it to the moon and payoff APHA holders bigly. It ticked back up to $16 at close. If it drops again I‚Äôll buy more.

138,DD," Recognise that penny stocks are inherently volitile and small changes in price can have big percentage changes to your portfolio. Trade with a plan with buy in and exit strategies (for both gain and losses). Research before buy, don't just accept a DD at face value. Use charts, trend lines and indicators to guide your decisions, read guides or books if you don't know how and there are decent free charting tools out there if your broker sucks. Keep your charts updated as well as your view point on the stock. Don't trade emotionally, don't chase losses, don't marry your position, do stick to your strategy.
