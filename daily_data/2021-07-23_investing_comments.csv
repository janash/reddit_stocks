TikTok is really starting to challenge YouTube but AliExpress is no longer the bargain basement emporium it once was (they have to charge VAT now too).

Netflix - my Samsung TV comes with free TV and YouTube. I don't need any more TV.

43,DTE," You can get 155% annualized returns much better ways than rolling a 50/50 dice on which direction the market will go and by how much (by weighting it against you with ITM options).

Just selling a put against TQQQ has 187.30% annualized returns for a now 7 DTE put. And if you're wrong about what direction the market took or by how much and you end up owning the underlying, you just write a call against it.

Not sure how you are thinking 155% at 25% risk with a bi-directional strategy is good...

You're literally just buying options, which a monkey can do, and getting lucky on which way the market goes by expiry and by how much.

Even at 25% your account is liable to blow-up within 2 trades.

And what you're considering opportunities are just uninformed luck. While it was probable the market would rebound after Monday, it was equally probable it would have dropped to its next level of support. And there was no way to determine either direction.

But rather than create a bidirectional straddle to take advantage of market volatility in EITHER direction.

You got **LESS GAINS** for **GREATER RISK** by buying a call.

And I guess you think you're cool.

* the regulators will keep on beating the stock down, but business fundamentals won't change - likely - depends on your situation: how long can you hold and how deep in the red you are.

* we already saw the worst, it's close the bottom - unlikely, I still think DIDI will hit the news at least a couple times more - hold

Chinese Nationals know this. They have an inflated real estate market partially because stocks don't give comparable return despite continued stellar growth in the economy. Because the government has too much power (by US standards) over what companies can do to make profit. The government especially cracks down on ""profitable but not socially responsible"" actions, which it judges more or less unilaterally.

78,BABA," Xi will definitely kill tech companies that are backed by the other part of CCP that is a threat to him and his power. Look at what he did to ANT and BABA. That action already started to make even the stupid people realize CCP controls businesses, not like USA where business control the government.

Xi doesn't care about DIDI (or BABA) that money and influence goes to his rivals and not to Xi's group. Xi is more concerned about keeping face, keeping power, and know that the money will come later in a different way. This is why the regulators can crush Didi since Xi's faction has nothing to lose and everything to gain such as humiliation of Jiang Zemin, former president, and giving chance for a Xi-backed service to gain market share in China.

Didi pissed off Xi, and is backed by Jiang Zemin's group, just like Alibaba, as it also has the roots to Alibaba through Cheng Wei, the founder, who worked at BABA.
