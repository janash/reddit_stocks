73,RH," Beyond the resentment that people have over Robinhood's poor handling of the meme stocks debacle, RH has far fewer investing tools than any other broker, and worse execution of orders. Market orders typically fill higher, not at best available execution -- for which the [SEC issued a $65M fine](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321) this past December. 

Likewise, Limit orders take longer to execute, because Robinhood routes orders to its preferred market makers -- the ones who pay them the most.

As for the issue of tools -- Robinhood's charting is so primitive, that people have to look up historic info on other sites. And they have a complete lack of stock screening, individual stock news, earnings calendar, etc. 

Robinhood also has a very short pre-market (30 minutes, 9AM eastern) and post-market (2 hours, to 6PM) extended trading window. WeBull in contrast extended trading starts at 4AM Eastern, and ends at 8PM! 

The one area that RH does shine in, however, is making options orders very easy. But that's also what has gotten them into trouble, as they have allowed unsophisticated customers jump in over their head, without providing accurate information-- sometimes with catastrophic results, such as in the case of a 20 year old who killed himself when Robinhood incorrectly showed he had a negative balance of $730,000. They are now being [sued over that by his bereaved parents](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alex-kearns-robinhood-trader-suicide-wrongful-death-suit/).

79,UI," It is surprisingly hard for large companies to do this.

When you look at all of the large banks, almost all of them are heavily investing in UX talent right now. Seriously, look at their job boards... they're trying to hire lots of UX designers (and researchers, interaction designers, etc). But, that shit takes time, lots of time. You wouldn't believe the amount of work that goes into making something more simple and less confusing. Making big dumb confusing shit is fast and easy!

The problem they all have, that robinhood doesn't have, is massive legacy systems in areas or features that Robinhood will not touch. It's the same advantage Tesla has in the car market. Not having a bunch of old shit to deal with is a huge moving advantage.

Having a moat is usually good, but it can be bad when it limits how nimble you can be when market winds shift. That said, the other car companies are slower to pivot, but when they do Tesla is going to have a tough time competing on things like quality, parts distribution, timely repairs, etc and they'll be the ones playing catch up for awhile.

It's probably going to be 2+ years before many of the big banks have a trading user experience that is half as svelte as Robinhood, and even then it will probably be a new trading product and not a redesign of an existing one.

Since Morgan Stanley acquired eTrade last year, I think eTrade has a good shot at being one of the first to receive a big UI overhaul.",AutoGeek3000,19,/r/stocks/comments/nyyzvz/how_come_etrade_isnt_usually_recommended/h1mxiam/,0.12,0.785,0.095,-0.856

Even if it’s as simple as a “proactive camera,” where instead of just recording footage to review later, it can detect suspicious behavior and issue warnings and star running through a playbook of planned actions. It opens the door for cheaper security monitoring, especially in places that would benefit from it that don’t current have a permanent solution, like convenience stores or ATMs.

142,GM," Nah you're wrong there. If it were true then it'd apply to Toyota or Chevy today, which it doesn't. 

Battery technology was inefficient and cost prohibitive. There's a reason Toyota isn't where Tesla is today despite having the Prius very early. There's a reason Chevy isn't where Tesla despite having the Volt early. And it's the same reason why GM wouldn't be where Tesla is today had they just stuck with their 90s piece of crap. 

Tesla. Made. EV. VIABLE. They are the only reason why batteries are cheap enough, powerful enough, and last long enough for an EV to even be a viable alternative to standard cars. Tesla designed the batteries from scratch to perform well enough and last long enough to be a true and genuine alternative to gas engines. GM/Chevy/Ford would never have gotten to this point because they source batteries from others and therefore played no role in advancing battery technology. They just looked at what batteries were available on the market and tried making the best out of it. Essentially they were chronically a few years behind where modern tech should've been. 

Musk designed Tesla to be vertically integrated specifically so they'd be making their own batteries to reduce cost and allow them to maximize the efficiency as much as possible. On top of all that, they created a national infrastructure of charging stations.

Before Tesla there were way too many obvious disadvantages to owning an all-electric car for your average consumer to even consider it. Without Tesla, there still would be.

I think it comes down to flaccid corporate leadership that is afraid to take any risk, goaded on by pension funds and Wall Street types who wanted to treat their dividend as an entitlement program.

178,DD," It’s easier than you think. If you invest in growth here’s what you do: take most of your technical and financial analysis and dump it in the trash. It feel stupid to say this, but honestly it’s kinda sentiment and forward thinking speculation. There is some amount of balance sheet analysis but it’s more just to acknowledge that the company knows what they’re doing to some degree. For the most part when you look at a growth company’s balance sheet it looks like they’re taking bundles of money and lighting them on fire to run their heat. You can’t really tell tbh. It can be as simple as the board deciding that they don’t need anymore “growth” and flip the switch and start becoming profitable. It’s BS I know, but that’s my honest opinion. Financial analysis is for value investors which will be disappearing in the near future as those companies begin to fade as products and services. The new value will be the growth stock of today which will cool off as valuations settle and they turn off the growth.

188,DD," $PTRA

It's currently listed as $ACTC, but the merger vote passed overwhelmingly on Friday and it'll be de-SPACed and listed as PTRA on Tuesday. Here's another comment I wrote about it a couple days ago:

>A lot of things, but to keep it brief: they’re selling shovels (batteries and charging stations) in a gold (EV) rush. Unlike the majority of SPACs, it’s already a functional business with a steady stream of revenue. Commercial EV represents a vast untapped market — estimated $260b right now — and Proterra currently serves HALF of the market (front runner status). 

> The Biden admin has already made it very clear that investing in this sector is one of their central priorities — Biden had a virtual tour of Proterra HQ to promote the infrastructure bill not too long ago. Commercial EV has been largely overlooked in favor of flashier companies like Lucid or Tesla, but it has the potential to be really big. American-made definitely helps with Proterra too.

> I think a large reason why this stock has been overlooked in recent months is simply due to SPAC hate, which is understandable with so many bad ones abound. However, I believe th****e stock has real potential of taking off once it officially is de-SPACed on Tuesday and becomes Proterra (PTRA).

201,CAT," I have a similar strategy. Some of my current favorite speculative picks-

VACQ: SPAC for RocketLab with merger expected in July. The only real proven small rocket company to consistently reach orbit. Essentially the (very) little brother to SpaceX, but they have a niche in small satellite launches and vertical integration, with plans to scale up. Michael Burry owns a decent sized chunk. 

PSTH: Bill Ackman’s SPAC hybrid that will be buying a stake in Universal Music Group. Very profitable and established business. The kicker is that you also get shares or warrants in Bill’s next 2 mergers. So potentially 3 stocks for 1 SPAC. Complex deal, but could pay off big. Research the details before jumping in. 

I also like CAT and the semiconductor stocks/ETFs but don’t hold any of them currently.",AstroDog3,2,/r/stocks/comments/nz08yc/looking_to_open_some_new_riskier_positions_with/h1n1cl1/,0.012,0.878,0.11,0.8998

268,GM," I’ve certainly looked at the R&D budgets of Tesla’s competitors vs Tesla. VW and Toyota both spend over $10B a year vs $1.5B for Tesla. Ford and GM also spend 3x as much. 

Tesla’s value assumes both that the majority of cars will eventually be electric and that Tesla will maintain the market lead, although its 30% dip from its peak recognizes that competition from larger and better funded automakers is heating up.

At Oatly’s current value, similar assumptions are not fully priced in for their industry. They might not ever be, who knows. In this case there are many other plant-based milks besides oatmilk. The bet is not just that dairy will keep declining (despite being healthier and perfectly sustainable) but that soy milk or other alternative will not have a resurgence in popularity.",SmallParade,-3,/r/stocks/comments/nyt281/looking_at_otly/h1m0qy1/,0.0,0.902,0.098,0.8957

273,IMO," Well I take the ""invest in what you know"" intensely and criticize the quality of products in that space.

I never considered Beyond Meat to be particularly good and was never excited about the product. I believe the key metric in the plant-based market is **repeat** customers, rather than consumers trying things out as a novelty. This is why I think some investors are wrong to consider that the majority of Beyond meat consumers are not plant-based consumers. To me, Beyond meat seems like a product that's pushed by investors and  competitors that aren't fully knowledgeable about the plant-based market.

I was excited about Impossible some time ago, when I first tried it and they were closer to establishing a proper moat around the meat substitute market. However over the years my excitement has decreased. It's pretty easy to cook Impossible meat incorrectly resulting in an even worse product experience than Beyond.  So getting Impossible in places like Burger King and Red Robin results in an absolutely terrible and expensive experience. The room for error in Impossible is its biggest problem.

My experience with plant-based milk has been a gradual one. I absolutely love dairy and cheese and my consumption of dairy has remained stable throughout the years. Almond milk, soy milk, etc; it was good but it was not enough. I would have it if there wasn't milk around or I would use it to cook some vegan plates. If it makes sense, I found it totally lackluster to use almond milk in a core ""milk"" dish like cereal, so I just stuck to typical dairy.

Oatmilk consumption was very similar to my consumption of Impossible beef. It excited me genuinely and I felt compelled to tell people about (word-of-mouth is a true human phenomenon). Over the years, my consumption of dairy has decreased for the consumption of plant-based creams and oatmilk.

Plant-based cheese still has a way to go, but the cream and milk quality is there. I have a strong preference for it these days which is abnormal consumer behavior choice. I was motivated to go plant-based on my own accord, but my motivation to stop consuming dairy was motivated by the quality of the alternatives. Cashew products are what I use for heavier creams, and oatmilk products are what I use for more liquid uses.

On that note, I read through Oatly's S-1 in its entirety because I always believed that plant-based dairy consumption would eventually find its way and I was happy to see that Oatly also looks forward to integrating into pea protein, which is found in meat subsitutes like Beyond or Gardein, and potato starch which is found in many fermented vegan cheeses. Pea protein is also a common alternative in health markets for exercise where Whey is unavailable for some plant-based diets and Oats are quite common in health drinks that want to boost their protein/calorie intakes.

The quality of ingredients is also excellent. They use oils so that it could be partitioned for cooking purposes or to add a similar fatty flavor profile to dairy milk. I could go, but I think you get the point, Oatly is the real deal IMO.",notbrokemexican,4,/r/stocks/comments/nyt281/looking_at_otly/h1mtzv2/,0.042,0.846,0.112,0.9903

There is no hard rule what differentiates between the two, just a general guideline. So you may want to avoid swing trading and definitely avoid day trading in your TFSA. 

Again no hard rule, but if the CRA determines you are using your TFSA for trading, expect to pay taxes and a penalty. Kind of annoying there is no clear cut way to know if you are breaking the rules, but I would stay on the side of caution.

If you're genuinely in this for 10 years, I think price is more negotiable, but I'm not buying at this price.

I'll say, 90% of my portfolio is currently in commodities. Mining, PMs, and oil. Barrick is a not  insignificant portion of that. So you can guess my opinions on that holding.

There's a reason why they had such short interest.",Ideaambiguousawhole,1,/r/stocks/comments/nz1e8j/how_do_we_capitalize_off_of_meme_stock_mania/h1n8ykv/,0.127,0.782,0.091,-0.4404

GME still on an exponential curve, suspected because of shorting:

To be frank, I got in back in January for the squeeze 100%. I knew absolutely nothing about stocks or the stock market. In 6 months, I've learned about as many aspects as I can, including ways that stocks can be manipulated. I've poured through SEC filings, broker check filings, news articles, etc. I'm coming from a place that if it is to be considered a gamble, it's the most asymmetric I've ever seen. I'll remain in GME after too.   


That sub might come off as cult like or a bunch of dumb people, but I'd argue that some of the research coming out of there will be studied for a long time after all this.",DigitalArts,0,/r/stocks/comments/nz1e8j/how_do_we_capitalize_off_of_meme_stock_mania/h1ninda/,0.058,0.916,0.026,-0.5574
354,GME," I still feel like there's no further value to be gained from holding GME at this point in time, which is the point. I respect the short squeeze, but continuing to hold GME will only stand for the hedge funds to gain more from shorting it when it inevitably falls. 

At this point, it's gambling whether reason, or irrationally wins out on a daily basis, and who knows when reason will prevail.",Ideaambiguousawhole,2,/r/stocks/comments/nz1e8j/how_do_we_capitalize_off_of_meme_stock_mania/h1niyuv/,0.06,0.735,0.204,0.899
355,GME," That's the idea yeah, but by their own rules and laws they are supposed to follow, they control the room with the price movements, but slowly the tide is rising, and retail controls the door. Only way out is if GME goes bankrupt or they cover. Being debt free and having access to $1b+ in cash can do a lot of things, but I don't see bankruptcy in the cards anytime soon. 

&#x200B;

You're completely right, the whole situation is irrational, but we didn't start it or break laws, they did. If the US has any hope of keeping the stock market with any sort of credibility, then game already over and it's just a war of attrition. Costs retail nothing aside from the entry ticket to hold. Costs them more and more to keep shorting the stock and digging their hole deeper.

You said you wanted to make money. Not financial advice, but you have people from every walk of life, from engineers to quants in that group. Every angle was picked apart and peer reviewed. I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss at least GME from the equation. Good luck though.",DigitalArts,1,/r/stocks/comments/nz1e8j/how_do_we_capitalize_off_of_meme_stock_mania/h1nl59t/,0.077,0.84,0.082,0.0387
356,GME," I mean, I agree with the idea of screwing over the hedge funds, but that was months ago. Hedge funds shorting GME now are shorting it at 200, not 10 dollars. Much more to gain, a lot less to loose when there's a limit to how much money regular investors have. Buying it now is financial suicide imo.",Ideaambiguousawhole,3,/r/stocks/comments/nz1e8j/how_do_we_capitalize_off_of_meme_stock_mania/h1n5fdw/,0.155,0.742,0.103,-0.5369
