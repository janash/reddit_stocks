0,AI," This DD sucks because it is so narrowly focused on QNX. QNX is not BB's main offering.  Look at the company from a complete perspective. 

I don't even think you fully understand from a technical point what QNX does or how it fits in the tech stack. There is an entire QNX stack that covers everything from security to entertainment.  17 OEMs are using QNX and the number is only increasing with IOT expanding. Android auto is literally built along with QNX. Car companies are coming out with their own UI & entertainment systems that run on top of QNX.

When it comes to the EV play, BB IVY & QNX will be dominant players in the industry because of the security they provide. Understand that cars are basically becoming computers with wheels. That is a dangerous, because someone can hack a car and fuck shit up. They could run it into a group of people or load it with explosives are have it auto drive into a building.   People are giving a lot of weight to QNX (due to the EV & IOT play), but they need to understand that this isn't the only reason to buy BB.

I think you (and a lot of people) are looking at this the wrong way. You really need to understand that BB is now a (cyber) security company first. The security standard for BB is the highest in the industry and it is no joke. There is a reason the G20 countries have contracts with BB. This OEM's still has a lot of power in the industry and you guy are forgetting that BB was and still is an OG player in the industry.  Here are all products/services that BB is offering besides: [BlackBerry - All Products](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/all-products)

**Unified Endpoint Manager (UEM):** An enterprise mobility management platform that provides provisional and access control over smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops with support for all major platforms including iOS, Android (including Android for Work and Samsung KNOX), BlackBerry 10, Windows 10, and Mac OS.

**Spark Suites:** Spark offers visibility and protection across all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It leverages AI, machine learning and automation to provide improved cyber threat prevention.

**SecuSUITE:** Phone application to allow employees to use work related data in personal devices without cross communication (between personal and work data).

* End to end encryption.
* Separation of concerns between personal and work data. Employers CANNOT access your personal data.
* Used by NATO; doesn't carry much value in my book but maybe in yours.

**QNX: Embedded system OS.**

* Multi-OS housing: It has the capability to allow for multiple OSs on a single chip.
* Real-time availability/software prioritization: Not all pieces of software operate on the same priority. Steering/braking would be higher priority than media, and QNX allows for that. Even if the thread/core is shared with other applications, when high priority software is requesting a resource it will be prioritized to ensure reliability.
* Resource sharing: CPU, RAM, and GPU resource sharing between different applications capability. Two applications can share the same CPU core and bump each other based on prioritization.
* Why not Linux? QNX has the highest certification for security available. Linux does not. CEOs would want to avoid liability and this certification allows for that.
* Device agnostic: It can be installed on any device, not just cars. Any IoT and offline device can use QNX.

**QNX Hypervisor:** Consolidate multiple OSs on a single SoC using virtualization

* SoC: System on a chip. Instead of using multiple ECUs, which is what car manufacturers currently do, they can use one single chip to run multiple high priority applications and multiple OSs. This is what Tesla does now.
* Virtualization: Running an OS in a virtual environment. Think Linux environment inside of Windows. This helps with debugging for developers without having to have the actual hardware.

**IVY: Scalable cloud-connected software platform for vehicles.**

* What is it a solution for? When a vehicle manufacturer wants a way to transmit the QNX/OS data safely, normalize it, and visualize it/interact with it. It also allows car manufacturers to own the data, unlike other OSs.
* Scalable: AWS servers are capable of handling the load from many endpoints.
* Software platform: There is currently no centralized software ecosystem for vehicles. IVY is providing that.
* Non-BB developers would be able to use an SDK to develop applications on IVY for infotainment/general apps/others. IVY will also use ML to gain insight on unrecognized patterns by developers. An example of this is detecting if a car slipped, without having the developer connect multiple sensors to figure out if that event happened.
* 50/50 joint effort on revenue and effort to develop the ecosystem. Using AWS's knowledge in AI/ML for calculated sensors (slip, driver on seat, etc)
* Usage by other vendors: A city can connect to the data from vehicles and detect when ice/slipping is happening. If brakes are getting overheated coming from a high elevation area. If a car had an accident, etc. An insurance company can provide an app to give discounts similar to the currently implemented OBD-2 readers. A maintenance provider can also connect to this data and check if an error is specific to maintenance, malpractice, or general misuse.

Than you got patents, major/huge lawsuits won, acquiring other security companies, decent leadership, getting out of mobile, pivoting to focus in software, decent cash inflow, etc...I hope BB will close around 20 by the end of the year. Just need a few catalysts. I think the rocket is being built right now and will blast off as soon as we get some fuel.

With that said, I want to add one more Con to the list:

Blackberry has yet to figure out how to generate profit off of this product they have.  They are currently trying to make QNX a subcription-based product, but currently they are selling it as a one-time payment.

They are not worth hyping ""to the moon"" until they get that resolved, AND the resolution ends up in their favor.

Their security products are tip tier, and BB is valued much lower than the other companies in the cybersecurity sector. Mainly due to the misconception that BB is still a phone company.

IVY has the possibility to compete with Tesla to change how we think about our cars in general. It has the power of Amazon marketing behind it. It has the possibility of recurring massive revenue for very little overhead.

26,ACC," QNX was never about infotainment. Which is why the whole premise of your “all these companies ditched QNX so BB == bad” is flawed. 

The infotainment system does not and should not ever be tied into the safety core of the car. The CAN bus is where critical messages for power steering, braking, LKAS, and ACC are taking place. The CAN bus system in every modern vehicle operates independently of infotainment modules because should the infotainment system fail, it cannot prevent safety features from working. 

Telematics, the QNX core, is so much closer to the vehicles operation than the infotainment system. 

A good friend of mine works for AISIN that is 50% owned by Toyota and provides the infotainment core to all modern Toyota and Lexus vehicles. They don’t touch telematics, they are a consumer of the telematics API instead of a publisher. 

In short, your premise is flawed. Every manufacturer in the world could drop QNX for infotainment and it wouldn’t matter in the slightest to BB. Because that was never it’s core value proposition. 

The fact that Amazon has partnered with them for telematics in the cloud is the death blow.  QNX is setting up to be the single cloud equivalent of Tesla’s proprietary cloud offering for vehicle telematics. 

If QNX takes hold there, it means every manufacturer benefits from driving data from every car. Tesla has ground out billions of miles using their own fleet. Whereas all the manufacturers you mention can benefit collectively from all the data of the rest in real-time and catch Tesla’s ML model very very quickly.

secondly, I think your thesis is wrong just because there is 1 thing you are not taking into account that nullifies everything you said related to price bearishness:

There is upside because the company is undervalued and until we get out of undervalued stock prices, we won't see any bearish price action. Whenever we stabilize on a value that is for example in a decent PE ratio compared to others in the same industry, that's when all these thesis will be useful to understand if we are overhyping it or not. Until a stock gets out of undervalued values, all thesis are useless and will present reasons for the price not to skyrocket, but to only go up until a certain value, not below.

63,BB," From a trading perspective what I would ask you is,

if you are bearish, are you going to short the stock or just not buy it?

If your action is to just not buy it and this reaction is the market's response, then it wont affect the price.
It will then rely on fundamentals to increase the share price. 

As long as their revenue stays consistent, then the share price should trade flat.

Now, if you intend to short it, on a large scale this will have an impact. Here you would be competing against the wave of people who are looking to buy highly shorted stocks(gme type of trade), the company's performance, and borrowing costs.

In this scenario, you'd be at a disadvantage imo.

99,BB," I don't own equity in BlackBerry, and it's unlikely I ever will, but it's a popular company on Reddit lately, so I'll thrown my thoughts into the ring once again.

BlackBerry transitioned into a software company several years ago, but their financials have not improved. Their revenue has heavily relied on IP sales, which cannot continue in perpetuity, and their software/IoT has performed poorly. QNX is a dated system, and while it can certainly be improved upon, it will be facing a significant amount of new competition. We are already seeing companies abandon QNX, while other companies are developing new ecosystems. Consider that Apple hired Dan Dodge, the founder and developer of QNX. 

> When it comes to the EV play, BB IVY & QNX will be dominant players in the industry because of the security they provide

This feels like a catch phrase at this point. I've seen many users quote the word ""security"" without detail or context. Do you believe that companies like Apple and Google are incapable of producing secure software? 

The bottom line for me is this. BlackBerry could not grow their revenue despite having minimal to no competition throughout much of their sector. For instance, as a historical point, QNX has been used due to a lack of viable alternatives. They made their transition into software and cyber security years ago, so their current model is not new. Moving forward, they will face substantially more competition from the world's leading technology and automotive companies. The stock trades approximately 4x higher than where it was only a few months ago, despite no meaningful accomplishments. 

So, to make a profitably investment at the current moment, we need to assume that BlackBerry is going to perform well enough to justify its current valuation, plus an increase in valuation, despite an incredible amount of new competition. Is this possible? Sure, I suppose it's possible, but it seems unlikely.",thirtydelta,1,/r/investing/comments/ld4k0x/why_i_am_bearish_on_bb_technical_analysis/gm5sryb/,0.071,0.813,0.116,0.9403

For instance, as a historical point, QNX has been used due to a lack of viable alternatives. They made their transition into software and cyber security years ago, so their current model is not new. Moving forward, they will face substantially more competition from the world's leading technology and automotive companies. The stock trades approximately 4x higher than where it was only a few months ago, despite no meaningful accomplishments.

101,IP," I don't own equity in BlackBerry, and it's unlikely I ever will, but it's a popular company on Reddit lately, so I'll thrown my thoughts into the ring once again.

BlackBerry transitioned into a software company several years ago, but their financials have not improved. Their revenue has heavily relied on IP sales, which cannot continue in perpetuity, and their software/IoT has performed poorly. QNX is a dated system, and while it can certainly be improved upon, it will be facing a significant amount of new competition. We are already seeing companies abandon QNX, while other companies are developing new ecosystems. Consider that Apple hired Dan Dodge, the founder and developer of QNX.

It's far more likely that they suck at engineering, and possibly that they put less competent teams on the audio system because ""it doesn't matter that much"".

Either customer experience doesn't matter (clueless and actually dangerous when one considers distractions on the road and things like volume malfunctions, phone dialing) or they don't define let alone enforce non-functional requirements on things like the audio system. Sad!

184,SYNC," > it’s easier to re-map your PCM and build a new fuel map from scratch than it is to get your phone paired with Ford’s SYNC audio control system. Which is embarrassing. Why? Because Ford tried to use QNX for both platforms, yet QNX is much, much better a platform for PCM modifications than fucking radio controls. 

It's far more likely that they suck at engineering, and possibly that they put less competent teams on the audio system because ""it doesn't matter that much"".

Either customer experience doesn't matter (clueless and actually dangerous when one considers distractions on the road and things like volume malfunctions, phone dialing) or they don't define let alone enforce non-functional requirements on things like the audio system. Sad!

188,BB," I think QNX, as a 30+ year old well understood and trusted technology, is being positioned by BB to be a foundation on which automotive software systems can be developed. What Tesla has shown us is the the car is just a new software OS platform and BB is trying to develop a suite of products to establish a deep offering in the space. It is in 175 million cars already, primarily in embedded roles (engine function, etc). They are trying to extend it to all areas of the car with a variety of middle-ware, which may or may not be successful, as OP notes, there is a lot of competition in the space.

However, no car manufacturer is going to use Android to control your braking, hydraulics, and other critical functions, so I believe QNX will continue to be necessary for these applications, and many car companies will elect to layer other OSes over it for user apps. BB knows this too, which is why they provide the QNX hypervisor, which is like VMware for your car, allowing you to run other OSes on top ofthe QNX platform.

Personally I think there is a lot of promise here, and I have a long position in the company.

196,BB," QNX is a *real-time* OS.  It's designed to be non-interrupt driven.  Android and other user interfaces use lots of interrupts to make whatever the user is doing the most important thing...ignoring background tasks for a few of microsecond.  You can't do that in a real-time system like managing emissions or ignition.  You have to use a real-time OS.  

QNX was really stripped down when BB bought it.  It's so lean that it can be real-time.  Linux would need lots of excess computing hardware to operate as reliably for engine control.  

I think the OP is confusing the infotainment interface (which QNX can do) and the vehicle controls (which has to be some simple response-control module or a real-time OS like QNX).",dvm,21,/r/investing/comments/ld4k0x/why_i_am_bearish_on_bb_technical_analysis/gm4ploc/,0.035,0.907,0.058,0.4391

For comparison, I live in NYC currently, have a good career, and am on track for my retirement in my early 60s despite some major life events (working on bringing that number down by a few years). I bought 2 shares of $GME for fun. I bought a little too late, sold a little too late (around $150), and lost a little money on it, as I expected to. It was fun for a lark, but I treated it like going to Las Vegas. I knew the chances it would go anywhere after the initial jump were pretty low.

What I really didn't like was watching WSB become such an aggressively hostile cult where dissenting voices were shouted down, the sound of barking replaced dialogue, and intense group pressure was put on people who had doubts. It became scarier over time as people talked about putting in their life savings.

235,GME," I enjoyed the WSB memes, so I got into GME fairly early compared to most.  My cost basis was around $39.

In hindsight I wish I would have kept the original meme limit sale of $420.69.  But I bought into the ""remove your limit sales"" propaganda they were spewing over there.

I'm glad I found this sub and r/stocks and I made a post about feeling bad for selling my stocks.  I ended up recovering my initial investment before the stock price fell below $200.  I should have sold it all at this point.

I ended up with a 30k profit when I got out at around $120 or so.  I could have had over $140k though if I sold at $400.

I'm salty af, but thankful I walked away with something and learned some hard lessons.

238,GME," I fell into this one pretty hard as well, FOMO driving almost every decision I made along the way. I’m normally a buy-and-hold person when it comes to the market. I’m not quite retirement age but I’m no longer working, slowly selling off investments as my source of income. As long as I live modestly and don’t do anything foolish, I should be out of time before I’m out of money.

Then along came GME, and I was late to the dance. I wound up with 50 shares at an average of $330, at which point I put in a sell order at $410 - “I may be dumb but I’m no fool,” I told myself. It hit $400 and I FOMO-canceled the order, replacing it with a trailing stop of 10%; “hey, it’s still going up, I’ll ride it and use a trailing stop to close out before I take a loss.” Meanwhile, I was rolling my eyes at all of the hype and shenanigans on WSB.

It peaked close to $500 and started to drop, and I thought “well heck, this is just a dip! Hold!” so I FOMO-canceled my order again. Once it dropped below my basis, I kept telling myself it would go back up, and I kept reinforcing that baseless thought by gobbling up all the hype on WSB (even while simultaneously thinking it was nuts). Finally sold at $88 just before it bounced back up to around $120 (at which point I *almost* FOMO-bought back in!).

Compounding the pain for me is that while I was preoccupied over GME I completely ignored the rest of my portfolio. I have a few thousand shares of MAC that I picked up as a long-term during my “COVID drop shopping spree” for around $7, and I didn’t even notice it spiking a week or so ago; I was too busy obsessing elsewhere (*refresh, refresh, refresh*). Reminds me of the days when I was so busy playing Ultima Online that I’d forget to eat or sleep. 

Lots of lessons for me. I regret the losses but even more I regret abandoning reason and sound judgement, and overruling my own few efforts to impose sanity along the way.

269,GME," Everything is a learning experience. Sometimes mistakes lose you money and sometimes they just mean you don't make as much as you should have. I feel like I have gotten significantly better as an investor every year since I put my life savings into the market during the black week of 2008. 

My advice would be to work on getting better at identifying speculation and set a limit for how much you can invest in it. Could be 10, 20 or even 50% (mine is like 1-2%, but I'm sure there are massive holdings in my portfolio that others would identify as speculation that I do not). In my opinion, risk is the hardest thing to properly quantify and one of the most important. 

FWIW, I put a little money into some of those names as well to see what would happen. Risk was high, but potential reward was higher.

There’s many of us this happened to but the lesson is priceless imo (if you actually take it). You get to write off the capital gains loss so it wasn’t all for nothing either. No such thing as poof moneys gone.This will be helpful as you become a better investor and will see more gains faster without having to pay as much taxes. Everything that goes around comes around and evens out in the end. Instead of making a bunch of money and spending it on crap or gaining a false sense of success, you were humbled and now you have the tax write offs to offset future gains. You also won’t make this mistake with *real* money in the future (hopefully). Finally it should show you there is no such thing as a quick buck and gambling don’t work in the long term.

If you want to stay in the market you can still go aggressive but have someone else manage your money, invest in Cathy Wood’s innovation ETF or something along those lines, some safer shit also, diversify, and then maybe save 5-10% of your port for that high risk high growth speculative shit.

Never invested in stock before. Have a good steady income so can play around with small amounts of money on a whim. Which is what I ended up doing a week ago, jumping on the hype train and buying a small amount of GME. Got swept away in the mania, believing it would peak even higher, despite all evidence to the contrary. The echo chamber in WSB was not helping.

Short story even shorter: lost about 500€. 150€ of which went into brokerage commissions unbeknownst to me except after the fact, that was another lesson.

But thinking about it, 500€ for a valuable lesson in stocks and shares and options and leverage and short selling and long positions etc etc etc, could end up being an excellent investment in itself.

289,GME," It was quite a week.

Personally, I lost a little bit of money (nothing critical) but learned a few very important lessons.

\- I first got in at around $80, which was still a pretty good price point; I made a mistake and bought a few more shares at $300, diluting my position.

\- My second mistake was by being too greedy and not securing the profits - on Thursday afternoon I removed my MIT sell order at $450 AND didn't create any stop-loss order. Very stupid since this is what I going to sell at initially.

\- Finally, I got so fixated on the unrealised Thursday's profit that I waited until early this week to sell, watching how my gains are steadily evaporating.

On the positive side, this whole madness finally convinced me to take a more aggressive approach to investing (I've been enjoying steady growth with a bunch of ETFs prior to this point) and revisit the foundations of technical analysis.

Yep. Most people would agree. I don't think that POV is by any means uncommon.

>For comparison, I live in NYC currently, have a good career, and am on track for my retirement in my early 60s despite some major life events (working on bringing that number down by a few years). I bought 2 shares of $GME for fun. I bought a little too late, sold a little too late (around $150), and lost a little money on it, as I expected to. It was fun for a lark, but I treated it like going to Las Vegas. I knew the chances it would go anywhere after the initial jump were pretty low.

Same (almost). While I went in with the same mindset as you, I am not in a field that will get me to retirement in a reasonable amount of time (dropped out of school; no career). I went in at the same price and the same attitude for 3 shares.

361,GME," Implied volatility. Options are bets on a future outcome. Essentially like insurance. For it to be worth selling insurance, the insurer is paid a premium. It's the same with options: the seller receives a premium on top of what the option is ""worth"" at the time.

Theoretically for options to be priced ""correctly"", the premium should reflect the probable average payout by the seller for this option contract by the time it expires, plus a risk premium that is at least as high as the risk-free rate. That's a lot of complicated math and figures, but what's important here is that you can compute all of it precisely. 

Well, with one exception: the volatility that the underlying stock experiences during the option contract's remaining lifetime has a massive influence on what the current price of the option should be, but of course it isn't knowable. Yet people still trade options and come up with prices. Which, when you do the computation backwards, yields a volatility that would fit the current price of the option. As this isn't a real volatility value, but just one implied by the market behavior, it's called implied volatility.

Essentially, IV is high when options are expensive and low when options are cheap. And IV is high when a lot of volatility is expected by the market in the near future. This means that when volatility is expected (i.e. there is massive uncertainty over where the stock is going) it is very profitable to sell options. 

To figure out whether IV is high or not you have to compare it to actual volatility. Which was high for GME, but not nearly as high as options prices implied.",skgoa,2,/r/investing/comments/lcroz5/gme_and_meme_stock_an_expensive_lesson_to_learn/gm40jma/,0.034,0.907,0.059,0.7299

364,GME," **2) Getting too greedy with GME or any other hyped up stock**

I bought GME because I wanted to ""get rich quick"". I put in $5k last Wednesday thinking I wouldn't take anything less than a $10k gain for some reason. Well I was up a good $3k Thursday, Friday, and Monday, but didn't sell because I was too greedy. I closed my position being down $3.5k. Had I held longer it would have probably be more like $4k or so now.

**Lesson:** Hyped up stock is dangerous, if you really want to gamble, use only the amount of money you are willing to lose or just bet on a sports game, it will be easier. Greed is also a dangerous game. It is euphoric to see a couple of thousand dollars of gains in a couple of days no doubt, but seeing tons people on WSB making 5 to 6 digit gains blinded me on how much a few of thousand is. I thought it was too little and got too greedy and held the stock too long. I am hating myself right now for not selling in the green when I had the chance.

**What I am doing now to not repeat the same mistake:** Unfollowing WSB and removing it from my Reddit home screen. I have put a big majority portion of my excess cash in my checking account into an S&P ETF for now and doing research on other stocks that I should be investing in. Having excess cash in my checking account allowed me the opportunity to spend it on dumb shit and gamble it away. I need forced scarcity to stay humble and stay focused about what I spend my money on. Maybe I will expand the 4 month emergency fund to 6 month and keep $1000 or $2000 at most in my checking account for day to day spending.

&#x200B;

**CONCLUSION**

During both the Covid drop and GME hype for a week, I literally stared at my phone screen from when I woke up to 8pm when after hours closed. I wanted to see every movement of the market/stock and it consumed me. I definitely could have used the time to do my work more efficiently or literally do anything else. This is what happens when you trade with emotion, it can and it will consume you.

The positive takeaway for both is that I am relatively young in my investing life. I am glad I made these few thousand dollar mistakes now rather than 10s or 100s of thousand dollar mistakes later on in my career if my portfolio had more money.

I had no debt other than my mortgage, and a modest emergency fund. They had a telegram channel pumping the stock (of course, at the time, I had never heard the term “pumping” before so I had no idea what was going on). I put $500 in, and the next day it was worth $1,000! I didn’t want to wait until payday. I needed to hurry and invest more, BIG, NOW. Before it really took off. Over the course of the next few months, I invested $23,000 into it, all using 0% balance transfers from my cc’s.

At one point, about 6 months after getting into it, the stock was worth $48,000! I felt on top of the world. I had done the same stupid thing with cryptos, and was down there, but I was up so much with the stock I didn’t care. I was being extra generous, putting everything on credit cards, not even budgeting anymore because I knew I’d have millions soon. I was in the telegram channel all day every day listening to all the great things about the stock.

It started to fall, and it was worth about $30,000. Anyone that questioned anything about the stock was immediately kicked out of the telegram room. Someone told me to go watch Boiler Room and I did. I started getting uneasy. I hired a taskrabbit in the area the company was located, and asked them to take pics of the office. It was just a single office in a building, with SIX different companies running out of it. And the sign was literally a piece of printer paper taped onto the door with scotch tape, written in pen. 

I was at break even when the CEO suddenly announced a reverse split. The stock very briefly went up, and I held on, thinking I could get all my gains back. Then it plunged. One of those plunges like $GME had. Like didn’t even take any breaks on the way down. By the time I gave up and sold, it was only worth $5,000. 

By the end of 2018, I had $65,000 in credit card debt and $17,000 worth of stock and cryptos. I ended up having to sell my house to get out of the debt. With the leftover money, I bought 3 bitcoin at $4k each. So the story hopefully won’t end too badly. :) 

I’ve definitely learned a lot about greed. And also how much money a few thousand really is, like you! It never seems like much until you lose it!

375,SIX," I got sucked into a penny stock in late 2017/2018 during the ICO/crypto craze. The stock was claiming to be associated with crypto. I had never invested in anything in my life. I had no debt other than my mortgage, and a modest emergency fund. They had a telegram channel pumping the stock (of course, at the time, I had never heard the term “pumping” before so I had no idea what was going on). I put $500 in, and the next day it was worth $1,000! I didn’t want to wait until payday. I needed to hurry and invest more, BIG, NOW. Before it really took off. Over the course of the next few months, I invested $23,000 into it, all using 0% balance transfers from my cc’s.

At one point, about 6 months after getting into it, the stock was worth $48,000! I felt on top of the world. I had done the same stupid thing with cryptos, and was down there, but I was up so much with the stock I didn’t care. I was being extra generous, putting everything on credit cards, not even budgeting anymore because I knew I’d have millions soon. I was in the telegram channel all day every day listening to all the great things about the stock.

It started to fall, and it was worth about $30,000. Anyone that questioned anything about the stock was immediately kicked out of the telegram room. Someone told me to go watch Boiler Room and I did. I started getting uneasy. I hired a taskrabbit in the area the company was located, and asked them to take pics of the office. It was just a single office in a building, with SIX different companies running out of it. And the sign was literally a piece of printer paper taped onto the door with scotch tape, written in pen.

385,SO," >Lesson: Timing the market is hard. It is SO much easier to just keep everything in and put MORE money into your positions on red days.

I'd argue putting more money into your positions on red days is just as dangerous. You should come with a level of risk tolerance and stick with it. If you really want to be responsive to prices, come up with a specific target threshhold of cash/stocks. For example, if your net worth is $120k, target 90% stocks 10% cash, with minimum of $10k in cash. Then if the market drops you buy, but you never end up taking more risk than you're comfortable with.

I was buying in with each drop without a particular strategy in mind, but when I was near the bottom I realized I had very little in cash left, and I could very well end up with nothing if the economy truly collapsed great depression style. This caused me to partially panic sell and go into silver which was also down at the time, and I believed it would handle stagflation well. I profited substantially as the recovery of silver beat the recovery of stocks, but much of that was luck.",skilliard7,1,/r/investing/comments/ld7rwx/self_accountability_2_big_mistakes_i_have_made_in/gm5l2ni/,0.104,0.741,0.155,0.912

And, frankly, you probably thought you'd never be in this position - due to going against everything you probably ""knew"" about investing due to this one time things being different - a sure thing.

I'm relatively new to investing myself.  I mean - I've got the retirement account going through work, which is awesome.  But I just opened a brokerage account back in August and started putting some money away outside of a 401K.  I've got an auto transfer for what I can invest that happens every paycheck and my plan has been to put essentially everything into an index fund or etf, and that's what I've done until today.

I decided I wanted to play around a little - and by little I mean really little - so I purchased my first couple of stocks today.  I think I'll continue with 95%+ going into indexes, and let myself mess around with any growth that comes from the other 5%.

But in all honesty - I don't have the time or energy to compete with the overall index and risk the rest.  I'm smart enough to know that I'm not smart enough and am more likely to lose than win.  And I'd still like to retire someday.

But I've also learned that FOMO is real.

405,GME," The big problem with GME is like many others you fell victim to the lies many were and still are perpetrating.

A new report was just released this morning that shows that short interest within GME is still number 1 in all of NASDAQ and NYSE. Lots of people this past week sold because ""ah no way all these misinformed people are lying."" Just to find out with the releasing reports that they were wrong. As soon as that report came out GME jumped from 50 back to 80. 

Its calmed a little but considering everything in the works and the super shady things I've seen this entire past week via order books, I truly believe GME will go higher. 

Report about short interest released this morning:

https://highshortinterest.com/?theme=2&_v=1&color=1&hl=en&sp=1

Personal evidence I collected from the order books showing the hedge runs are running out of shares to counterfeit because holders are hypothecating which is causing high limit orders to appear on the order book as basically the only shares available to queue:

Now I could be terribly wrong because I've only been investing 2 years and only got really into it this past year but even my day trading buddy who trades everyday for the past ten years said the order books look fishy and couldn't provide an explanation.

Now I've been looking at the order books for GME for the past two weeks even when it shot up to 500. Not once did I see anything like I'm seeing today and yesterday via the order book.

Edit: also look at Webull, Fidelity, and E-Trade data (yes I realize there are other brokers as well) for the past three days there have been more inflow than out, more buys than sells by a twofold amount. Aslo if you chart the volume the volume of buys relative to the price increase and the volume of sells relative to price decrease are not correct.

If anyone can poke holes in this with data to back it up, please do. I'm just tired of receiving messages about being a bag holder with no argument or data. I'm fine holding the stock. I want debate as to why people think this is over despite the data.",MLouie18,4,/r/investing/comments/ld7rwx/self_accountability_2_big_mistakes_i_have_made_in/gm4rsqi/,0.074,0.833,0.093,0.7783

421,DM," I day traded 10 years ago when the market finally started recovering from 2008 crisis. I was young and arrogant. Looking back, a good portion of it is luck because of economy. I couldn’t lose. Then one day, a stock I was 100% confident in got crushed. At the time I had a rule where I will never let a single stock exceed 10% of my entire portfolio (even that’s a lot). You can guess what happened next. 

So I changed my strategy since. Although the return is much higher doing single stock, so is the risk. As I got older and as my portfolio got bigger, stock market even seemed lacked diversity. So I expanded into foreign market and real estate. 

Slow and steady wins the race. Except this is not a linear trajectory. As your wealth build, money start making money and it grows faster and faster. Get rich quick is not as good as a good foundation of wealth building. 

My advice: sit back breath. Look down the road. 5, 10,20 years. What’s your current risk tolerance and goals. What’s your main stream of revenue and how to leverage it with correct risk gauge and plot a plan. Not just math but actual actions. Such as I want to put away x% in this this this and that.

456,GM," As someone who has been investing for 13 years and has been in this same place with some bad stocks I bought when I was a novice, all I can say is that you just have to get past it and try again.  Take whatever is left and invest it in companies that have good earnings, favorable P/E ratios, good analyst ratings, innovative products, etc.  It will take time but you will slowly dig yourself out of the hole.  Use this as a life lesson that only a very small minority are lucky enough to get rich quickly in the stock market, and it is better to be slow and steady with your portfolio growth.

I tend to tell newbie investors to buy Exchange Traded Funds instead of individual stocks.  ETF's are a basket of dozens or hundreds of companies contained within one fund, and if you buy ETF's from some good brokers like Fidelity or Vanguard they have extremely low expense ratios (.1% or less).  The benefit of ETF's are that you are not exposed to the booms and busts of a single stock - you're investing in an entire market sector so there is much less risk but still the potential for good performance.   If one or two of the companies in the fund goes bankrupt, it's just a little blip and hardly noticeable.  However, if you buy a single stock and that company happens to go bankrupt, you will lose everything very quickly.  I've been there - I bought GM in 2008 right before it filed for bankruptcy in early 2009, and I lost everything.

I enjoy buying stocks in individual companies because there is a higher risk/reward, but you need to put work into it.  Understand what you are investing in; read company press releases, read earnings reports, and generally know what is going on with the company so you can set an exit plan if that company is falling out of favor, facing headwinds, or running into financial trouble.  Never fall in love with a stock.  If things are heading south, get out and put that money into a different stock that is performing better.

The last thing I would say is that you need to ignore the daily market fluctuations.  Don't try to time the market - most people fail to time it correctly, even professionals.  If the company you are invested in is financially healthy but being impacted by an overall market slump, ignore your portfolio until things settle down.  There are so many times where I would be following stocks daily during high volatility and emotion would get the best of me.  I would sell and then regret it later when the volatility subsided and the stock moved above the price I sold it at.  Use dips as an opportunity to buy more.  You should be investing for the long-term - there was a study done over a 30 year period where people who attempted to time the market and missed the best 10 days of gains over that 30 year period far underperformed those who stayed in and never sold.  The years 2008 and 2009 were a very scary time to be an investor, but when you look at a 30 year chart, with the Dow now at 31,000, that 6,000 point crash that occurred back then is now just a little blip in time.

TL;DR - ETF's are better for new investors and less risky.  If buying individual stocks, do your research and know what you are buying.  Don't time the market - you are far more likely to lose.  Invest for the long-term and buy the dips when everyone else is selling.",bluehorseshoe87,30,/r/investing/comments/lcuiaj/to_all_sufferers_of_the_whole_fiasco_mental/gm2pwsl/,0.096,0.79,0.113,0.9172

458,GME," The saying every investor should have imprinted in their brain is from Warren Buffett.

""Be greedy when other's are fearful and fearful when others are greedy.""

The GME entry point was when the stock was $5 or below and everyone thought the company was garbage and going bankrupt at the nadir of the pandemic.  People were fearful. Above $300 people got greedy.  If you already made tons of money and were hoping for $1000, you learned a painful lesson in GREED.

The exit point was when the media and the bandwagoners and everyone and their mother was cashing out the mortgage.  People are being greedy.  Now get fearful and sell.

In reality, index 90% of your portfolio and dollar cost average like company 401k's do.  Set it and forget it.  S&P 500 has returned 9-10% annualized for the last 20 fucking years.  It's hard as fuck to beat that.

Emotionally you will want to hold in hopes of further gains - all stocks go up and down. If you don't realize profits on the way up you will be stuck holding the bag for years. 

I learned this during the Weed stock bubble of 2018. Had 200k of unrealized gains and ended up with -80k. I continued to hold for years hoping for a recovery in which time I missed out on regular market gains only to have a few companies fizzle out.

you know, its funny because normally i would call myself a very critical thinker, i could never fall for the Qannon, conspiracy stuff, right? but only when another user pointed out, that whenever S3 published some data about the lowered short interest people would scream: ""FAKE NEWS, MSM ARE All BOUGHT!"", but when the new york times reported something along the lines of: ""short interest might still be high"", everyone, including me, jumped right on it. which is EXACTLY what i thought could not happen to me. yet it did and now i feel ashamed, greedy, and frankly just dumb.

I've been investing my money for over 20 years now (started when I was 15 with a little custodial account). After seeing what happened after the .com crash of the 2000s and 9/11, I've started holding a decent chunk of money in low beta investments and cash to throw in every time there's a once-in-a-lifetime event (roughly every 10 years nowadays).

481,GME," Same buddy. I could have left with 50k returns but ended up with ~10k ones instead because I sold before the thursday peak. It stings but, I recently returned to investing and had told myself as a sort of 'pipe dream' type of goal that I wanted to hit 100% returns by the end of 2021. I'm currently at 140% and still growing, as I took my GME returns and have reinvested them in considerably safer ways. So I'm telling myself I should just be happy with what I gained, especially as it's barely February and I already hit my end of year goal, and it's slowly starting to sink in.

But, I knew that the reason was 100% on me and it just took over the weekend to get over it and do better trades. I was stupid but it was my own fault and I learned from it.

With GME I'm down about $2.5k and it feels *awful,* like unimaginably so. The reason is not because I made a stupid decision, went on holiday and came back to sub-50 per share. The reason it feels like shit is that it went tits up not because I personally made a bad judgement call on a bad trade, it was that the rules of the game changed which tipped the scales massively in the hedge funds favour. Even though it's a small loss compared to my previous ones (and let's be honest, I've made many more stupid trades on penny stocks, crypto etc.) it feels so much more exhausting knowing that you lost not because of your own fault but because even if you play by the rules it doesn't matter because the rules are arbitrary and can be changed on a whim just because poor people are suddenly winning against the system.",MagneTismen,5,/r/investing/comments/lcuiaj/to_all_sufferers_of_the_whole_fiasco_mental/gm3bqsz/,0.209,0.677,0.114,-0.9808

They're pretty high but I don't really see how it's a scumbag move as it's clear what the fees are in the fee schedule.

535,NVAX, One advantage of mRNA is that redosing is possible to treat variants unlike viral vector based ones where the host can develop immunity against the vector. But an issue is with the titer - putting more mRNA induces unpleasant side effects. Protein subunit vaccines are better equipped to deal with both viral mutation and side effects reduction. Since NVAX has both protein subunit and mRNA technology - its an added plus!  Also it can be stored in a normal freezer  - 4-8C. It does have a lot going for it even after the current pandemic passes - as the technology platform is very important for future vaccines.,angraamainyu,18,/r/investing/comments/ld1u00/nvax_4x_potential_market_ignoring_recurring/gm3ivj5/,0.031,0.878,0.091,0.683

604,IMO," Hear me out. I see pot stocks as a good short time play. But I think the tax burden will have to change in order for them to be a good long term play. In the short term the hype will drive them up. No doubt.

However, I have yet to see a Pot stock with positive cash flow from operating activities (maybe I missed one). IMO the problem is they compete with the black market. The legal pot market gets taxed crazy amounts (50% - 100%) because politicians see it as a cash cow. So let's think about it from the buyer's perspective. They have been buying weed from their local guy for say $100 for who knows how long. Then weed becomes legal and they are happy to support the legal industry. But the legal industry is selling the same quantity for $150 - $200. The buyers aren't going to do that for too long before they go back to buying from their local guy. Which is even less risky now since it's legal. So what do the legal shops have to do? They have to drop their prices to be competitive with the black market guys, and you have what you have now. Which is negative cashflow from operating activities.

I think the shift from prescription pain meds to cannabis is a bigger source of revenue than recreational use. I think there is a lot of competition on the recreational side. I like that it's a REIT because I think low interest rates will also fuel growth in the asset valuations.

The $10 psychological support area was visited this past week with a drop down to 9.81 but buying interest was found there as a bounce up to 11.07 occurred. Nonetheless, the overall formation remains bullish looking as it seems that a bullish flag formation might be in the process of being formed. The flagpole being the rally from 6.90 to 11.75 and the flag being the trading back down to 9.81.  If this flag is formed, the upside objective would be 14.55 (using 9.70 as the bottom of the flag). This fits in well with the intraweek resistance that is presently in place at 13.95 and at 15.30. Overall, the probabilities favor the bulls but it is also probable that for the next 2-3 weeks the traders will be building a new support base from which to launch the rally up to the $14 level.

However, penny stocks with low floats trading on the CSE are victims of no uptick rule in Canada don't require a massive short position to control the company's stock price, and on the contrary, it doesn't take a lot of buying pressure to move the stock 10%-20% in a single day to the upside. [The Tinley Beverage Company Inc. • Shortdata.ca](https://shortdata.ca/stock/TNY.CN/?fbclid=IwAR2C-yN7QS-RZr2nPkoydATp7nPrQhmD0WTNfPjAWw06b138MGhxmRSZE6U) 

It’s a global problem, but it poses the greatest threat to Canadian capital markets, where naked short selling—the process of selling shares you don’t own, thereby creating counterfeit or ‘phantom’ shares—survives and remains under the regulatory radar because Broker-Dealers do not have to report failing trades until they exceed 10 days.

This is an egregious act against capital markets, and it’s caused billions of dollars in damage.

Make no mistake about the enormity of this threat: Both foreign and domestic schemers have attacked Canada in an effort to bring down the stock prices of its publicly listed companies.

 In Canada alone, hundreds of billions of dollars have been vaporized from pension funds and regular, everyday Canadians because of this, according to Texas-based lawyer James W. Christian. Christian and his firm Christian Smith & Jewell LLP are heavy hitters in litigation related to stock manipulation and have prosecuted over 20 cases involving naked short selling and spoofing in the last 20 years. 

Their MO is to short weak, vulnerable companies by putting out negative reports that drive down their share price as much as possible.

This ensures that the shorted company in question no longer has the ability to obtain financing, putting them at the mercy of the same funds that were just shorting them. After cratering the shorted company's share price, the funds then start offering these companies financing usually through convertibles with a warrant attachment as a hedge (or potential future cover) against their short; and the companies take the offers because they have no choice left. Rinse and Repeat.

In addition to the foregoing madness, brokers are often complicit in these sorts of crimes through their booking of client shares as “long” when they are in fact “short”. This is where the practice moves from a regulatory gray area to conduct worthy of prison time.  

Naked short selling was officially labeled illegal in the U.S. and Europe after the 2008/2009 financial crisis. 

Making it illegal didn’t stop it from happening, however, because some of the more creative traders have discovered convenient gaps between paper and electronic trading systems, and they have taken advantage of those gaps to short stocks.

Still, it gets even more sinister.  

According to Christian, “global working groups” coordinate their attacks on specifically targeted companies in a “Mafia-like” strategy. 

Journalists are paid off, along with social media influencers and third-party research houses that are funded by what amounts to a conspiracy. Together, they collaborate to spread lies and negative narratives to destroy a stock.

648,AI," I would recommend taking a narrower view if you're looking to invest. For example, companies like Qorvo are great for high power semiconductor devices, but there currently isn't a huge need for such devices in automobiles as far as I'm aware. Similarly, Qualcomm specializes in more processor-based semiconductor technologies -- specifically in semiconductor technologies that allow for reduced power consumption and reduced footprint. Those can certainly be used in automobiles, and they may play a larger role in auto products that use AI/ML and autonomous vehicle types of features, but there are a number of reasons why I would choose other companies for automobile semiconductors. Figure out what small sector you want to hit -- say, semiconductors used in smart headlights -- and go for that. That's at least my recommendation as a former patent attorney for semiconductor companies and as a current tech transfer attorney for robotics and autonomous vehicle companies. Perhaps others directly in the auto field can weigh in further or correct me.",workingatbeingbetter,0,/r/investing/comments/ld8owt/semiconductor_shortage_in_auto_industry_investing/gm572mi/,0.014,0.863,0.123,0.9393

So while I agree with you that they aren't a major player (3% of their production), TSMC has committed to increasing their output in the auto market which in essence should increase their revenue stream. They are also a major player in Lidar chipsets which auto companies are going to need more of to compete with the likes of Tesla or other EV companies that use that as their main driverless technology. Lidar is also starting to be included on smartphones for 3d imaging which is being employed in a host of new markets like real estate, construction, drone technology, and robotics control. I agree that a lot of people are just looking at market cap vs price here and are scratching their head and saying buy buy buy, but there is an upside to it. However, with companies like Apple and Samsung now doing in-house chip production I would be cautious to not  overvalue TSMC.",Caveman_ATX,8,/r/investing/comments/ld8owt/semiconductor_shortage_in_auto_industry_investing/gm4lirq/,0.01,0.902,0.088,0.8511

From an investment standpoint. I don't need the money back for 50 years I guess.

These credit cards have an interest rate above 25% and I'm in thousands in debt. You have the option of pretending that doesn't exist though.

I know historically stocks go up, but what if we have a market like Japan where it never gets back to an all time high. I'm basically asking for input on whether the S&P 500 is overvalued.

694,GME," Question: How to determine cost average strategy?

Say a stock has had a recent catalyst which is causing short-term volatility, however you like the company long-term and would like to invest. I think this is a general question and not specific to one certain company/investment, but for the sake of understanding let's take GME as an example. I'm not interested in any of the drivers behind the recent price fluctuations, but I would like to be invested in the stock medium to long term. Dollar cost averaging would be a good tool to mitigate some risk in this scenario. The question I have is, are there certain parameters which determine the buying schedule of the dollar cost averaging? How would you determine the answer to the following:

695,UI," What is the difference between limit order and market order on Fidelity.

good morning.  I am new to stocks, and have only dabbled in robinhood and with the UI being so user friendly, I didn't understand a lot of terms at first.  Now on Fidelity, SOME stocks have market order when I try and buy, some have limit, and some have both.  I understand market is what the current price is right at that moment, but what's limit?  For example:

I want to buy a share of apple.  Apple is $100.  I go to buy by putting in a ""1"" and it gives me an error saying I need to do a limit order.  Kind of confused and not sure how to word my issue with google.

The current SP is \~137.

702,GME," Somehow missed this stickies thread and posted this as a normal thread, sorry about that.

So I’m completely new to anything to do with the stock market, and I - like many others - got wrapped up in the GME hype and inevitably made a loss. Not a huge amount, around £200, but enough to make me realise that I’m not suited to playing the investment game.

So, as a bit of background, I have tendencies towards addictive behaviour - gambling, impulse buying etc - usually this isn’t a problem, because I’m usually too poor to put any money into anything other than essentials. I avoid typical gambling (casinos etc) for this reason, but I had managed to convince myself that stock trading wasn’t gambling and, at least for me, that was wrong.

I inherited some money last year and after clearing my debt I’m left with around £10k which I’m trying to save to buy a house later on this year (uk house market is pretty screwed atm). I’ve been keeping this money in an easy access savings account for now, but I’m spending more of it than I would like. So basically, my questions are:

Is there a way to invest this money into something secure than would be a better option than me just putting the money in a fixed term ISA or similar, where I can just invest the money and forget about it? 

If the above is a decent option, what are the recommendations for some safe places to invest? 

I’m still learning the ins and outs of investing, and I’m not 100% sure what everything means. I hear a lot of talk about ETFs, but I’m not sure what they actually are. Would someone be able to give an idiot proof description of these, and is this a good investment?

With a starting investment of £10k, what - if any - return could I expect on this? I’m not particularly interested in massively pushing my money ‘to the moon’ as it were, but a little bit of passive income would be nice to build back the money I’ve stupidly spent.

I appreciate these are probably common questions, but I know that I can’t truly trust myself with this money any more and I want to put it somewhere safe where it can hopefully make a little on the side.

703,GME," Very new to options, any help is appreciated

(Background: I'm an idiot, I invested in GME pretty much at the top and bought into the hype and have lost 75% at this point. The only good thing to come of this is that I learned so much about investing in less than a week!)

I'm deciding between taking out what little money I have left in my GME stock or putting puts to cover just in case. I'm not exactly sure how to do this. I don't need the money now, I can wait to see what happens. I have 26 shares bought at around $300. 


I read up on options for several days but when I go look at the options chain for GME puts right now, they barely make any sense. I obviously don't understand it well enough. This isn't about GameStop, I'm trying to understand the concept in general for future trading. 

The GME stock is at around 58 right now. 

The puts available with close expiration dates have a strike price of around 57-65 and cost about 15-20 per share. 

How does that make any sense? Why would anyone get it if it's so expensive but with such low returns. Is it because everyone is assuming the price will go down and this isn't usual? 

I thought I'd be able to buy a put with a strike price of around $15-$20, an expiration date of the next few weeks because that's what I think it may go down to and I'll recoup some of what I invested in longs.

After the GME thing, I got inspired to dabble in the market, and bought my very first stock as a learning experience.

If so, given the time zone difference, for plays that try to follow trends for quick wins i.e. swing trades over the course of a few days, is there any strategy that should be employed like buying at the end of one day then selling at the beginning of another?

711,GME," 25m, recently finished uni/Master’s.  

Had around £7k in the bank, bought into GME early enough (15@38), then kept averaging up around 90-110. And then a few more when it hit 300. I’m avg 40@89 now (currently -£1k).  Always planned to cover the investment and said if I made £10k I’d be done. I kept watching it rise, screenshot my 10k profit, and never cashed out. 

I got into this knowingly at first, though clearly bought into the hype as time went on.. but I still have rent money, and I do believe that GameStop has some potential to turn around (though maybe not to the levels last week saw), but I also wouldn’t have put in ~£2.8k initially as a value investment alone.

I really tried not to follow ‘the meme’, be cautious and do my research and still ended up here? But I learnt a lot about the markets and myself and that I REALLY should have covered myself when I had the chance, and would like to keep learning and getting involved with investing. 

I know it’s the question to ask rn, but any suggestions on whether to realise the £1k loss or keep holding out?

I’ve done my DD, I’ve made my conclusions. Asking here what others think about the future of LL.
Their fortunes last year were bolstered by the pandemic and many folks found themselves with a check from the Gov and time on their hands. Lots of projects around the house. Many featured on other subs here on Reddit.
I originally got tipped off to LL back when they were at $7 and rode some options to a quick triple, then got focused on other things. A redditor posted some DD back then saying they would go to $30, and that’s exactly what they did by Fall. Should have stayed the course...
However. With pandemic going to end later this year (rather, once we reach critical vaccination mass we expect changes in society that will have many folks returning to labor jobs), I’m betting against further growth for LL and probably a run down or a plateau. This makes it attractive for selling calls and iron condors if it’s going to plateau.
But I like to read the perspective of others, so let me hear what you think?",Misaiato,1,/r/investing/comments/ld4283/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gm4ktjk/,0.012,0.927,0.061,0.8126

I don’t have the ability to trade on options until acct is at 2k through TD so I’m currently doing stocks until I can get there and I’m not too far off. My question is in regards to options. If there are a high volume of option interest and fewer puts does that mean most people think that they will meet the strike price or can you not really factor that in? I’m trying to see when to sell. I know nothing is 100% but I’d like to utilize as much information as I can to see if the current dip is because of a true sell off or something else.

743,AAPL," Hello all, I am a total beginner to investment that first got into the market during the dip in March 2020. I am 26 yo living in the US. I am unemployed atmo as I was working as a bartender when the pandemic hit. I am receiving unemployment and that is my only source of income right now. I currently use RobinHood for the majority of my portfolio, Stash for my ETFs and Roth IRA, and Acorns just for the round-ups. My RobinHood is around 12k rn and I only have about 3k in my IRA. I'm starting to realize that for my interests (long term investment strategy for retirement) I probably made the wrong calls in how I invested. Basically I don't understand how anything works and just put a bunch of money into individual stocks on Robinhood because I thought that's what you do?

Since the sh*storm that's gone on with RH re: GameStop etc, I'm thinking it's probably best for me to move to a more established/reputable company and I have been looking specifically at Charles Schwab. From my initial research it looks like Schwab mainly offers ETFs and Index more so than individual stocks? I know they only allow fractional shares from S&P500 companies, and I don't even know if the companies I'm invested in fit that. I'm not currently invested in any Index Funds. 

If you have any sort of experience/knowledge you're probably reading this like ""wow this person is an idiot"". I know, but please be nice to me. I really don't think investments/stocks are very accessible to the average person and I tried to do A LOT of research/speaking with family with investment experience before I got into the market and I still have no idea what's going on. I think there are a lot of barriers to access on purpose, especially for someone like me who just worked as a bartender and is now unemployed. 

TL/DR: Basically, is it worth transferring my portfolio through an ACAT from RH to Schwab or Fidelity if it's all individual stocks, or should I just cash out and use the liquid funds to reinvest in ETFs and Index Funds that better suit my 25+ year long term investment goals?

I'm starting to realize that for my interests (long term investment strategy for retirement) I probably made the wrong calls in how I invested.

The area of stocks that I like to focus on the most are small-mid cap natural gas and oil pipelines and transporters.

I have followed these stocks long enough that I *feel* like I understand their range pretty well and I would like to start swing trading between a basket of 4-5 of these stocks.

So my newbie question here is,

1. What is the best free stock screener

2. Is a stock screener the correct tool to compare stocks?

3. I am trying to find a way to overlay the price action of these stocks so I can see who in the basket is up and down. I want to do this so I can lock in some gains with who is up and move it into who is down. What sort of tooling would allow me to do that most effectively?

That transfer was approved as I received notification from E*TRADE last evening that assets would start to be transferred over within 1 to 2 business days. This morning when I logged on to my Robin Hood account to see how things were progressing I noticed that the portfolio value is now over $600 and I have no idea why. I’m also showing $400 in buying power and $400 available for withdrawal. Could someone please explain why? Is it because the shares have all settled?

If you can afford to hold on to it for 30 days you can write it off your income taxes, and if you can't then you can write it off any other gains you get the rest of the year.

As far as your motivation... I'd say try to find a good paper trading app. I like Etrade's for the immersion, but an excel chart works just as well. Read a lot about investing strategy and pick what is right for you before you start.

Do you want long term low risk where you never have to look at it and come back and see a 3% yearly gain?

Do you want medium risk where you might need to check on it month to month and keep up with company earnings? You might get a 5% growth with something like this...

Or do you want high risk where you need to be watching your stocks on a daily, hourly, or minute by minute basis? This is how professionals earn their living income.

If you want to call GME a strategy you could look into chasing squeezes or getting in on the pump of a pump-and-dump that some hedge is running. Or you could go to a casino and play a hand of blackjack, you'd probably have similar odds.

Not reasonable.

""So far i started looking at YouTube for the basics. It all feels click bate as fuck.""

A lot of it is (""like and subscribe!"")

""My understanding is pick a sector then a company and invest based on you best educated guess""

You can pick themes or industries and then look for the best candidates (do research into the company - read the annual report, read the most recent transcripts,  read customer reviews, read company and broad industry articles, etc.) if you think something will be a strong theme in the years ahead, but best really before everyone else starts talking about it. If everyone else is talking about it, it's not necessarily over but it's not early.

I think a lot of ""hyped"" sectors/names get ahead of themselves and the last one in is often the first one out when the stock corrects. The people in early and who have a much lower cost basis can have the luxury of the long-term view; when the cost basis is a lot lower, a 10-20% decline is a bummer but doesn't likely phase them that much if they have a long-term view. It's the person who was late to the party and who is now losing is often the first to leave.

""In the short term, Sana is planning to treat various cancers, with a plan to file new drug applications next year. But its ambitions are actually bigger.

“Our long-term aspirations are to be able to control or modify any gene in the body, to replace any cell that is damaged or missing, and to markedly improve access to cellular and gene-based medicines,” the company wrote in its IPO prospectus.

At the GeekWire Summit last October, Sana CEO Steve Harr explained how they are essentially turning the body into its own “bioreactor,” which can fend off disease.

“You deliver the tools to enable your body to make its own medicine,” Harr said at the time.

Even without the IPO, Sana is sitting on a large cash pile. At the close of 2020, the company reported cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $412 million. But like many emerging biotech companies it is losing money. It has posted a net loss every quarter, and its accumulated deficit since founding stood at $316 million as of September 30, 2020.""",dvdmovie1,1,/r/investing/comments/ld4283/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gm4y93t/,0.058,0.885,0.057,-0.0258

822,CD," If you have decent or better credit save that $800 a month for 6 months then find an FHA lender in your area and talk to them about a first time home buyer FHA loan. You don't even need that much of a down payment with an FHA loan but the more you can put down the cheaper your monthly home payment would be, obviously.  Most 30 year fixed rate FHA loan rates are 3% or even lower right now which is just unbelievably low.

Another suggestion I can offer is take the 30 year mortgage for the cheapest possible monthly payment.  That leaves some wiggle room for ""life happens"" over the years.  If you want to pay it off faster than 30 years you can throw more at it if/when you are able.  If you simply make one extra principle only payment every year on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage your mortgage would be paid off in about 21 or so years give or take. 

As for where to put your money you may be able to find an ok but stable savings rate at credit union or possibly even a short term CD but more folks around here may have better ideas on that front. Hope this gives you some food for thought and a few ideas at least.  Cheers!",BitOfIrish,1,/r/investing/comments/ld4283/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gm4x7ir/,0.031,0.849,0.12,0.9636

You buy 25 shares of SPY today at $388 (9700). You're single, making 50k AGI which is the 22% income tax bracket and 15% LTCG bracket.  

In March, June, September, and December, they'll distribute dividends, currently at around 1.5% yearly rate. So $145 in dividends each year, all qualified. You'll be taxed 15% on those at the end of the year, or $22.  

The fund's price grows 13% in year one, -12% year two, 0% year three, 21% year four, and 15% year five. That's a cumulative gain of 38% ($3725). When you sell and realize those capital gains, you'll owe 15% tax on that, which is $559. and you're also reinvesting 1.5% dividends each year for more shares which will have some gain at the end and a few dollars additional tax.

900,CEO," *tldr: if you like BTC, buy BTC. I spent 2-3 weeks fulltime obsessively researching mining, MARA and RIOT, and determining the actual profitability of miners throughout the last 7 years by analyzing hashrate, $BTC, and hardware specs and price. Mining is super competitive and misunderstood -- they are more of a utility than a play on BTC. *Network hashrate / difficulty always goes up and destroys the temporary profitability miners enjoy during surges in $BTC -- do not project off of todays profitability!**

If you like BTC, go long in BTC.

I highly advise staying away from Bitcoin miners.  They are vastly overvalued and misunderstood, and their prices are propped up by two things:

* Hype around BTC and lack of public traded ways to invest directly in BTC
* Grossly misunderstood business model

The first is self explanatory. Sure, you can buy GBTC and pay a little premium for the scarcity and management fee.  However, investors somehow believe they are clever by buying mining stocks and feel this is somehow a leveraged play, as well. If you buy in now, you are betting not only on BTC going up, but the hype going up as well. You are at the whim of a wildly misinformed and enthused crowd that does not value these things on fundamentals, not even remotely so.

Second, the business model. I've seen many arguments like those in this post about projected BTC's per day, $/BTC, etc, etc. I used to get angry, shocked, appalled, and all worked up about it. Posts like this are so blatantly short sighted and ignorant of BTC mining that I just can't believe this is how people choose to invest their money. I'm now at peace with it, because people will believe what they want to believe, and only a select few people will put in the work to acquire the knowledge necessary.

I spent three weeks fulltime studying, compiling spreadsheets, and modelling bitcoin mining, for each generation of available hardware I can see the returns miners saw. I've done the same level of research on MARA. I looked at all of their SEC filing, took apart their purchase orders, and made a sheet that tracks their fleet and finances month by month -- when they get new miners shipped, when they pay for them, etc. You can trust me, or not.

Here it goes.

**Bitcoin mining is like running on a treadmill.**

Bitcoin mining is a fixed-sum, hyper competitive space -- by design. You first need to understand how mining works. You pay for hashrate (upfront for hardware, then for electricity), and you get a share of the rewards proportional to your hashrate vs the hashrate of everyone else.  So if you have 1TH/s, and the network rate is 100TH/s, you can expect 1% of rewards.  Currently, the rewards are about 100BTC/day, and this will halve every 4 years (it halved earlier last year).

That's basically the game. Now you need to understand a very simple economic principle:  **The more profitable it is to mine now, the less profitable it will be to mine later**.  It's a race to the bottom. This is proven by simple economic arguments, as well as by the history of bitcoin mining.

The reason for this is the concept of **difficulty** -- the higher the network hashrate is, the more hashrate you yourself need to get the same reward.  In other words, as more people participate, your revenue declines.  This is not like gold -- you cannot go off to your own mine and chip away and collect gold. No. This mine gives out rewards at a fixed rate, and your share is proportional to the work you put in relative to *everyone else*. As others join in, you need to work more to earn your keep. This is ""network hashrate"".  And if you look at a chart of it, you'll see why it sucks to be a miner.

If it's profitable to buy hardware and mine BTC -- you can bet your ass other miners will buy hardware and put them online. This raises the global hashrate, and so it reduces the amount of BTC you will mine.  If it's *super profitable* to mine, then that only increases the speed at which miners buy hardware, so hashrate will increase even faster.  See how this works? It's a race to the bottom for profit margins.

Now, that should be enough for you to see that mining is not easy money. In fact, there is *extremely little* you can do as a miner to best your competitors. Electricity is electricity (and is not the primary cost), and they all buy hardware from the same manufacturers. You can pay people to set up your farm. There is very little barrier to entry. And there is very little economy of scale.  (Even with MARA's giant orders, they hardly got any discount.  As you can imagine, the manufacturers have no trouble selling profitable hardware.)

Now let's make things worse for miners by considering how the hardware they buy is constantly going obsolete. Every new model by the manufacturers is faster, and more profitable. Remember what ""more profitable"" means? It means miners will buy it, and raise up hashrate, and your margins go down. Unless, of course, you buy that new hardware. You should now see that BTC mining is essentially an arms race.

The key to all of the above is as follows:  **the network hashrate always increases, and miners are always forced to buy new hardware in order to maintain the same BTC/day**.  It is preposterous to project out say X TH/s will earn you Y BTC/day in the future (at the given hashrate).  Hashrate can 10x in a year ... if it does, well, now you only get Y/10 BTC/day.

I've gone through all the data for the last 6 years and analyzed how miners have fared, given that they run the absolute best hardware and upgraded ASAP.  It's not bad, but it's not great. They can expect maybe a 1-3x return on each generation of hardware they buy (provided there is a big burst in BTC price, like now).  That's about all. They are continually dumping capital into hardware, running it until it's obsolete, and repeating.

**I also found that BTC outperformed miners, by a long shot. That is, if miners had just purchased BTC instead of hardware to mine BTC, they would have done a lot better... it's not even remotely close.** So why outlay your capital to them, rather than bitcoin?

For every $1.00 worth of BTC mined, about $0.90 of that goes to manufacturers and electricity costs. This makes perfect economic sense -- hardware makers, middlemen, and utilities are essentially the gatekeepers of mining and as such they should capture most of the profit.  If it were something like $0.50, then they would be incentivized to raise prices.  **Remember how to get rich in a gold mine -- sell the shovels. That's hardware, and electricity.**

Finally, some litmus tests:

* How can owning $100m in hardware input a $2b valuation?  What value add is MARA adding? Collectively, probably like $4b of that hardware will be sold -- do you think the total market cap of miners should be $80b?
* Do you think MARA is the only one that is going to receive big shipments of this hardware? No. All miners are going to upgrade to it, and they will simply explode the network hashrate. This is how it has always been, and always will be.
* What do you think 1% of the network hashrate is worth? It entitles get 1% of BTC rewards... so 1BTC/day. What valuation would you put on that? Now consider the cost of upkeeping that 1%. Remember, hashrate always goes up.

To conclude, please stop ignoring network hashrate, aka difficulty. That, and price of BTC is the crux of the entire industry. Network hashrate always catches up, and always ensures miners remain nothing more but utilities making some fixed percentage on their capital, in exchange for hedging the risk between outlaying $'s for equipment, but earning BTC in return.

I will say one thing. MARA is positioned better than most miners simply because it was able to fund purchases ahead of the pack (of public miners that declare their puchases).  I was long MARA and short RIOT for this reason -- that hedged out volatility and sentiment, and put me in a position to make $ if investors actually cared about earnings, fleet size, etc.  It worked out and I exited that and I'm done with this, because investors in these stocks are not rational at all.

However, MARA's CEO is one greedy man. To me, it's clear this is all a cash grab to him. On Dec 31 he decided on his own bonus structure: it will amount to 7m shares if/when the market cap stays above $2b for 30 days. 5m shares for $1b for 30 days.  **That's tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to the CEO... which is almost as much as the company has invested in hardware (basically it's only asset).**  Seem a bit excessive to me, and contrary to the benefit of other shareholders. Why not just spend those shares or $ on expansion?

Regarding the hardware shortage, there's a possibility that the shortage means whoever gets these juice S19's and whatever else will fare far better than other competitors. However, I personally find it hard to believe that the manufacturers would not be aware that they could sell their super-highly-profitable hardware for higher prices, and that they wouldn't sell boatloads of it.  Also, we know only that it is sold out until the end of the year -- we know nothing about the size of the inventory and who else they are selling to (hint: themselves, other chinese miners, etc).  Do not be surprised if hashrate goes up 3-10x by the end of the year, as it did in 2017.

My take on the entire mining industry:  One or both of these will happen:

* Bitcoin hype dies down. 
* Investors start to really start to look at earnings vs capital expenditure, and realize they are on a treadmill.

It is preposterous to project out say X TH/s will earn you Y BTC/day in the future (at the given hashrate).  Hashrate can 10x in a year ... if it does, well, now you only get Y/10 BTC/day.

I've gone through all the data for the last 6 years and analyzed how miners have fared, given that they run the absolute best hardware and upgraded ASAP.  It's not bad, but it's not great. They can expect maybe a 1-3x return on each generation of hardware they buy (provided there is a big burst in BTC price, like now).  That's about all. They are continually dumping capital into hardware, running it until it's obsolete, and repeating.

**I also found that BTC outperformed miners, by a long shot. That is, if miners had just purchased BTC instead of hardware to mine BTC, they would have done a lot better... it's not even remotely close.** So why outlay your capital to them, rather than bitcoin?

For every $1.00 worth of BTC mined, about $0.90 of that goes to manufacturers and electricity costs. This makes perfect economic sense -- hardware makers, middlemen, and utilities are essentially the gatekeepers of mining and as such they should capture most of the profit.  If it were something like $0.50, then they would be incentivized to raise prices.  **Remember how to get rich in a gold mine -- sell the shovels. That's hardware, and electricity.**

Finally, some litmus tests:

* How can owning $100m in hardware input a $2b valuation?  What value add is MARA adding? Collectively, probably like $4b of that hardware will be sold -- do you think the total market cap of miners should be $80b?
* Do you think MARA is the only one that is going to receive big shipments of this hardware? No. All miners are going to upgrade to it, and they will simply explode the network hashrate. This is how it has always been, and always will be.
* What do you think 1% of the network hashrate is worth? It entitles get 1% of BTC rewards... so 1BTC/day. What valuation would you put on that? Now consider the cost of upkeeping that 1%. Remember, hashrate always goes up.

To conclude, please stop ignoring network hashrate, aka difficulty. That, and price of BTC is the crux of the entire industry. Network hashrate always catches up, and always ensures miners remain nothing more but utilities making some fixed percentage on their capital, in exchange for hedging the risk between outlaying $'s for equipment, but earning BTC in return.

I will say one thing. MARA is positioned better than most miners simply because it was able to fund purchases ahead of the pack (of public miners that declare their puchases).  I was long MARA and short RIOT for this reason -- that hedged out volatility and sentiment, and put me in a position to make $ if investors actually cared about earnings, fleet size, etc.  It worked out and I exited that and I'm done with this, because investors in these stocks are not rational at all.

However, MARA's CEO is one greedy man. To me, it's clear this is all a cash grab to him. On Dec 31 he decided on his own bonus structure: it will amount to 7m shares if/when the market cap stays above $2b for 30 days. 5m shares for $1b for 30 days.  **That's tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to the CEO... which is almost as much as the company has invested in hardware (basically it's only asset).**  Seem a bit excessive to me, and contrary to the benefit of other shareholders. Why not just spend those shares or $ on expansion?

Regarding the hardware shortage, there's a possibility that the shortage means whoever gets these juice S19's and whatever else will fare far better than other competitors. However, I personally find it hard to believe that the manufacturers would not be aware that they could sell their super-highly-profitable hardware for higher prices, and that they wouldn't sell boatloads of it.  Also, we know only that it is sold out until the end of the year -- we know nothing about the size of the inventory and who else they are selling to (hint: themselves, other chinese miners, etc).  Do not be surprised if hashrate goes up 3-10x by the end of the year, as it did in 2017.

My take on the entire mining industry:  One or both of these will happen:

* Bitcoin hype dies down. 
* Investors start to really start to look at earnings vs capital expenditure, and realize they are on a treadmill.

903,TH," *tldr: if you like BTC, buy BTC. I spent 2-3 weeks fulltime obsessively researching mining, MARA and RIOT, and determining the actual profitability of miners throughout the last 7 years by analyzing hashrate, $BTC, and hardware specs and price. Mining is super competitive and misunderstood -- they are more of a utility than a play on BTC. *Network hashrate / difficulty always goes up and destroys the temporary profitability miners enjoy during surges in $BTC -- do not project off of todays profitability!**

If you like BTC, go long in BTC.

I highly advise staying away from Bitcoin miners.  They are vastly overvalued and misunderstood, and their prices are propped up by two things:

* Hype around BTC and lack of public traded ways to invest directly in BTC
* Grossly misunderstood business model

The first is self explanatory. Sure, you can buy GBTC and pay a little premium for the scarcity and management fee.  However, investors somehow believe they are clever by buying mining stocks and feel this is somehow a leveraged play, as well. If you buy in now, you are betting not only on BTC going up, but the hype going up as well. You are at the whim of a wildly misinformed and enthused crowd that does not value these things on fundamentals, not even remotely so.

Second, the business model. I've seen many arguments like those in this post about projected BTC's per day, $/BTC, etc, etc. I used to get angry, shocked, appalled, and all worked up about it. Posts like this are so blatantly short sighted and ignorant of BTC mining that I just can't believe this is how people choose to invest their money. I'm now at peace with it, because people will believe what they want to believe, and only a select few people will put in the work to acquire the knowledge necessary.

I spent three weeks fulltime studying, compiling spreadsheets, and modelling bitcoin mining, for each generation of available hardware I can see the returns miners saw. I've done the same level of research on MARA. I looked at all of their SEC filing, took apart their purchase orders, and made a sheet that tracks their fleet and finances month by month -- when they get new miners shipped, when they pay for them, etc. You can trust me, or not.

Here it goes.

**Bitcoin mining is like running on a treadmill.**

Bitcoin mining is a fixed-sum, hyper competitive space -- by design. You first need to understand how mining works. You pay for hashrate (upfront for hardware, then for electricity), and you get a share of the rewards proportional to your hashrate vs the hashrate of everyone else.  So if you have 1TH/s, and the network rate is 100TH/s, you can expect 1% of rewards.  Currently, the rewards are about 100BTC/day, and this will halve every 4 years (it halved earlier last year).

That's basically the game. Now you need to understand a very simple economic principle:  **The more profitable it is to mine now, the less profitable it will be to mine later**.  It's a race to the bottom. This is proven by simple economic arguments, as well as by the history of bitcoin mining.

The reason for this is the concept of **difficulty** -- the higher the network hashrate is, the more hashrate you yourself need to get the same reward.  In other words, as more people participate, your revenue declines.  This is not like gold -- you cannot go off to your own mine and chip away and collect gold. No. This mine gives out rewards at a fixed rate, and your share is proportional to the work you put in relative to *everyone else*. As others join in, you need to work more to earn your keep. This is ""network hashrate"".  And if you look at a chart of it, you'll see why it sucks to be a miner.

If it's profitable to buy hardware and mine BTC -- you can bet your ass other miners will buy hardware and put them online. This raises the global hashrate, and so it reduces the amount of BTC you will mine.  If it's *super profitable* to mine, then that only increases the speed at which miners buy hardware, so hashrate will increase even faster.  See how this works? It's a race to the bottom for profit margins.

Now, that should be enough for you to see that mining is not easy money. In fact, there is *extremely little* you can do as a miner to best your competitors. Electricity is electricity (and is not the primary cost), and they all buy hardware from the same manufacturers. You can pay people to set up your farm. There is very little barrier to entry. And there is very little economy of scale.  (Even with MARA's giant orders, they hardly got any discount.  As you can imagine, the manufacturers have no trouble selling profitable hardware.)

Now let's make things worse for miners by considering how the hardware they buy is constantly going obsolete. Every new model by the manufacturers is faster, and more profitable. Remember what ""more profitable"" means? It means miners will buy it, and raise up hashrate, and your margins go down. Unless, of course, you buy that new hardware. You should now see that BTC mining is essentially an arms race.

The key to all of the above is as follows:  **the network hashrate always increases, and miners are always forced to buy new hardware in order to maintain the same BTC/day**.  It is preposterous to project out say X TH/s will earn you Y BTC/day in the future (at the given hashrate).  Hashrate can 10x in a year ... if it does, well, now you only get Y/10 BTC/day.

The price of BTC does not move based off of hashrate, it's the other way around... except hashrate goes up regardless.  If it goes down, it means miners are not making a profit.

If you think it's likely bitcoin will go up, buy bitcoin.  Unless you want to go off of the temporary sentiment that miners are ""leveraged bitcoin"", then by all means go for MARA and ride the wave as long as it lasts.

> And for Mara’s valuation, it’s honestly undervalued at 1.95 Bil. They have $630 mil in cash and crypto + $100 mil from initial investment and then the SOTP of their entire current business + all ordered gear.

Their share price exploded from $BTC going up and people misjudging how much profit they would earn (because, like you, they project outward to infinity based on today's hashrates). The fact MARA's own investor presentations do this (save for a little asterisk that says ""based on todays network difficulty"") is abhorrent. 

Here's how it works. They raise capital while their stock is hot. They buy hardware to be delivered in the future -- literally anybody could do this. Then people think ""oh wow, when they get the hardware, they will mine X BTC/day!"".  Stock goes up. They do another offering and buy even more hardware.  Stock goes up. They do another offering and buy BTC. Now you are saying stock should go up even more.

In the meantime, CEO is about to take 7m shares for himself for all the hard work he put into... um... spending investors money on hardware and BTC?

It's your call if you want to invest. But I cannot justify valuing a company based strictly on their ability to purchase commodity hardware and BTC. I don't see any competitive advantage, and I see a lot of red flags. And, more importantly, I understand the economics of bitcoin mining at that there is no theoretical reason miners will outperform BTC, nor is there any evidence of this in practice.

These mining stocks are trading as ""leveraged BTC"" because they are misunderstood. As soon as investors understand them better, they will trade as utilities. You can try to play the market, and you might win if BTC goes up or people somehow get even more hyped about good Q1 revenues.  But the music will stop eventually.

If you do go in, my advice is to keep as close an eye on network hashrate as BTC price. Their ratio is nearly the only thing that matters to miners. Investors do not understand this.

You can also track their revenue pretty much in realtime -- you have all the info needed:  Number of each type of hardware miner, network hashrate, cost of electricity, price of BTC.",pennyether,5,/r/investing/comments/lctrib/why_mara_will_explode_this_year/gm2mb4r/,0.041,0.873,0.086,0.9627

It's by sharing opinions that you one can learn they are wrong. I have aggressively looked for counter opinions and flaws in my research. I've yet to find anything that suggests bitcoin mining is nearly as valuable as is reflected by miners' market caps.

The current market caps suggest mining, as a whole, is worth around $200b. Yet, mining is simply a utility. Maybe 10% of BTC's rewards are actual profit. The big question is: would you pay $200b for a spigot that pays out 10% of BTCs ongoing rewards in dollars? Do the math yourself.

**MARA, in my opinion, is certainly the most well positioned public mining company.** I won't deny that one bit. I think they will outperform all other miners on the grounds that their fleet will be the largest, and they ordered ahead of the crowd (other public miners) in a market where hardware is currently hard to get.  I just can't buy in on the current valuation.

As for ""first to act"" -- there is an entire economy of bitcoin mining. On what grounds do you believe MARA is receiving hardware before, say, miners in China with longstanding relationships to Bitmain and other manufacturers? The vast majority of miners are not public, and do not announce their purchases. And, a large amount of supply is pre-ordered by ""scalpers"" that resell it when BTC rises. 

So, what you are seeing in the POs of MARA and others is just the tip of the iceburg in terms of supply. This means there is plenty of more network hashrate that will be added throughout the year. That means less profit for MARA.

> to suggest that its not profitable when you see those operations pumping out hundreds of thousands if not millions a day is in my opinion just ignorant

I never said not profitable. I said their profits will not justify their valuation. The current profitability of mining is temporary -- this is when miners make the majority of their profits. BTC has gone up faster than network hashrate -- historically, this never lasts.  Hashrate will climb and chew away at profit margins.

A lot of the points you listed are understandable but scream value trap to me. Stating that they were one of the few banks to cut/suspend their dividend is essentially saying ""they are in substantially worse shape than their competition."" Cutting the dividend is basically a last resort for any company because the stock gets dumped by income funds which many people have money in for retirement. 

Points 3 and 6 are kind of contradictory because expanding the investment arm is going to be hard if they're also trying to cut costs. Usually if a company says they're expanding while cutting costs, they're either too optimistic, delusional, or lying. 

We just saw an extended period with low interest and banks underperformed the S&P500 over that time. Other than my belief that interest rates won't remain st zero for nearly a decade, I don't think much else will be different. To me it would basically be buying a weak competitor in a weak sector.

The issue with valuation of new therapies is that they don't always receive full uptake among the potential patient population.  That's aside from the risk of transitioning from Phase 3 to approval.

This seems roughly in-line with the IPO raise of $750mn ($3.9bn=$750/19.2%).*  However, there is an earn-out of 30mn shares which dilutes FTOC shareholders down to a little under 18% based upon 30mn new shares being issued to a total outstanding of ~370mn shares outstanding at close (my guess but not very clear). Honestly, I'm really just taking a SWAG here and am certainly open to others more knowledgeable weighing in.

* Note: The footnotes are conflicting in the presentation slide as note 8 says the PF ownership does not include the earn-out while note 10 indicates it does for the FTOC sponsor.

Taking the classes is great if you can but but if you are self directed the books can be had fairly cheap if used and can provide a really great foundation and kind of lens to view things through. If you don't have time for that I'd recommend just getting a book on financial terminology and trying to make sure you understand the definitions of all the terms, they often get thrown around loosely by media but usually have pretty specific meanings, and if you get to point where you are ""fluent"" everything you read/hear will make more sense.",localhelic0pter7,2,/r/investing/comments/lctdrl/investment_strategy_theory/gm39ldh/,0.0,0.85,0.15,0.9761

Intel has really been struggling in both design and manufacturing for a while now, and there are investors who even suggest that Intel completely drop off it's manufacturing arm and outsource instead like AMD and NVIDIA. Although Intel has lost ground in consumer chips, it's server chips are still king. Simply put, you have to look at Intel holistically.

1003,MSCI," I don't know if the jargon in this paper is too familiar, but other parts of it made it easy for me to understand factors.

Copypasta:

Couple months ago I tried to figure out what the hell MSCI and others talk about when they say there's a ""quality"" factor.

This paper really helped me out.

https://conferences.pionline.com/uploads/conference_admin/ERI_Scientific_Beta_Publication_Dimensions_of_Quality_Investing1.pdf

Why the profitability factor exists - Companies with high profitability factor loading - High Profitability Firms facing high cost of capital will focus on the most profitable projects for investments, and investors do not distinguish sufficiently between growth with high expected profitability and growth with low profitability, leading to under-pricing of profitable growth firms 

Why the investment factor exists - Companies with low investment factor loading - Low investment reflects firms limited scope for projects given high cost of capital, and investors under-price low investment firms due to expectation errors.

>...The corresponding factor is based on sorting stocks by asset growth into portfolios and creating a zero investment strategy called Conservative Minus  Aggressive  (CMA).  Cooper,  Gulen  and  Schill  (2008)  show  that  a  firm’s  asset  growth  is  an  important  determinant  of  stock  returns.  In  their  analysis,  low-investment  firms  (firms  with  low asset-growth  rates)  generate  about  8%  annual  outperformance  over  high-investment  firms  (firms  with  high  asset  growth  rates).

Interestingly, they show that the investment factor is able to explain a large proportion of the value premium  (low  valuation  firms  do  not  invest  a  lot  while  high  valuation  firms  invest  a  lot)  and  the  profitability  factor  explains  a  sizable  proportion  of  the  momentum  premium  (momentum  stocks  correspond  to  highly  profitable  firms).  They  suggest  using  their  four-factor  model  as  a  better  alternative to the Carhart four-factor model or Fama and French’s three-factor model and stress the economic grounding of the investment and profitability factors.",095179005,1,/r/investing/comments/lctlu0/books_on_factor_investing/gm2709d/,0.077,0.711,0.212,0.9946

1012,SNE," I'm long SNE too, but my entry point was years ago when it was more of a value play.

Sony is a funny beast.  They make money from digital cameras, selling optical components for phones (like iphone), video games, movies, music, and insurance.

I wouldn't call them a ""tech"" stock.  Besides their optical sensors for photography, they're not really providing bleeding edge technology.

I see them more as a content-media play.  While their Sony-Columbia library has a lot of value, they have been unsuccessful in monetizing it as a platform like Disney+. 

Gaming is important to Sony too, and they get a lot of press for Playstation 5, but they don't make money on the hardware sales, so its impact will be back-ended.

Finally, there's insurance.  This is an important division for SNE but one that is not well understood by most American investors.

I hold a Wealthfront taxable account about \~25% larger than the assets going into the IB account. The plan would be to use WF's portfolio line of credit feature as a ""bridge loan"", as it can fund in real-time, to cover any capital calls that IB might be too slow to cover. As a side note, WF only allows a 30% drawdown to total portfolio value.

I was thinking the company could be valuated at $5bn or $10bn tops, at IPO. Then it would make a lot of sense to get in at that price point where the stock could easily double in a year. But $30bn pre-IPO is insane. Just for a perspective, EA is at $40bn and Blizzard is at \~$75bn. 

Roblox could still be a good investment, but it will take a lot longer to realize significant gains. Which means a lot more things could go wrong before it becomes truly successful.

I've very often heard Roblox referenced as YouTube of gaming. YouTube spend billions of dollars a year on infrastructure to support so many users on its platform and it has the advantage of economy of scale as it lumps into Google's infrastructure. 

Roblox will either choose AWS or Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure for data center hosting solutions or it will have to spend billions building up it's own infrastructure. Either way, their capital investment cost will ramp up very quickly as it grows. 

They also have to pay the content producers who may or may not be infringing on other people's original IP. (I imagine Disney will quickly sue and end the SW themed Roblox games unless Disney gets a fat cut on the revenue).

Amazon has won in e-commerce for ages and will still do well, but Target and Walmart are doing very well in digital and are really starting to use their significant store fleets as an advantage.

3. Exposure to EM e-commerce. While certainly a minor part of a giant company, Walmart has investments in JD, DADA and others.

4. Further and further concentration of shopping.

Target has discussed this on conference calls. Walmart has already started to have 'dark stores' - stores that function only for pick-up.

All said and done the local dentist charged me $600 vs the $2400 SDC wanted. There are also a TON of competitors because anyone with a few thousand dollars can set up a competitor in their mom's basement. I actually thought about doing it myself and I have no prior dental experience.

The intraoral scanners are sold by 3M or TRIOS. 3SHAPE Smile Designer is the software to create the retainer from the initial scan. From there the .stl can be sent to a manufacture which there are tons of or you can print the models on a resin printer and vacuum form the retainers using Essex plastic.

Smile direct club is actually bad for the industry as they are really pushing what is ethical and giving customers very poor outcomes.

1037,ALGN," I was going to mention the quality of their product. It's inferior to the wires in terms of actually fixing your teeth, but more worryingly it's even inferior to Invisalign as well. Both beat wires in the visuals, but ALGN fixes teeth better than SDC. Neither SDC or ALGN can fix really bad cases the way wires can and their ability to move molars is inferior. SDC in particular is specialized in being a cheap way to align your front teeth.

Will say on the other hand that they do have a ""moat"" (I get your point in that it's more of a small puddle) is their convenience and options. Payment options, physical on site scan vs mail kit, and mail delivery of product. 

Main issue is that they aren't better than Invisalign which has more cash, sales, size, is more well known, the original innovator in the industry, and **their product is better**. It's so much better that they are pretty much dealing with proprietary eponym where people think SDC's product is ""an invisalign"" the same way searching online is called ""googling"" even if you use Microsoft Bing. 

SDC's advantages come with the fact that Invisalign also has no real moat outside of it's brand. And it's true that that some local guys are cheaper (the local guys in California charge more than either SDC or ALGN), SDC does have cost advantage against ALGN.",zxc123zxc123,1,/r/investing/comments/lctwnx/sdc_smile_direct_club_5x_upside_short_squeeze/gm513am/,0.062,0.788,0.15,0.9746

>The pricing is cheaper than orthodontists & the value of the end to end experience is cheaper than paying out of pocket. What makes them unethical?

Just take a look at some of the plans posted to /r/smiledirectclub they pay dentists $50 a pop to approve plans and I don't think I have ever seen a single customer turned down.  There approach doesn't utilize attachments or IPR so it is limited in what it can accomplish.  There is no way they should have a 100% approval rate.

>I agree that the local dentist gave you the better pricing. However, manufacturing mouth pieces, fitting them, & following up has hidden costs.

No hidden fees the process is really no different than SDC its just an extra revenue generator for the office since they already have all the equipment necessary.  SDC if anything has been a necessary evil in getting dentists to reduce prices for simpler cases.

>I know that they hold patients on manufacturing & the mouth piece itself. I don't know the patent specifics but it's worth looking up.

I would be weary about what they claim all these patents claims where initially made by Invisalign and the only reason SDC is around is because Invisalign's initial patents expired.",2phonesonefortheplug,2,/r/investing/comments/lctwnx/sdc_smile_direct_club_5x_upside_short_squeeze/gm51v7m/,0.074,0.87,0.055,-0.5186
