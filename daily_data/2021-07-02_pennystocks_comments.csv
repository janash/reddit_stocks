3,DD," Hey, thanks for asking!

I am a purpose driven investor that is making good money on my Exact Sciences investment -my core position is up around 2150 % now. For many years I was sharing all the info I could find about EXAS and paired it with my thoughts on the Yahoo message board. Needless to say, I wish I would have bought much more radically on the lows when It already seemed 100% obvious that it will become a massive success. So I promised to myself that whenever I’ll feel 100% confident that I found a multi-bagger - I will bet the farm. While for now I would have done better if I would have left my money at $Exas. I am actually very happy that I was able to accumulate almost 1% ownership of Biolargo. I attended the last 4 BLGO shareholder meetings, did almost daily DD, had conversations with all the key management people and did a few 1000 posts on various message boards. I am constantly reassessing my Biolargo investing strategy- so my DD is mainly for myself but might give interesting information for others as well. Also it has worked so well with EXAS and the info sharing that I am just continuing that DD/posting habit. And those 148 days ago i discovered reddit as the much better platform ;)

I am not a financial advisor, this post is made for educational purposes only. Literally. Don’t take my word for anything that is presented in this post, do your own research, and invest solely based on the thesis that you create for yourself. Don’t get influenced by anyone.

I honestly believe there is no better way to place the money than putting it into a purposeful company that will have a positive impact on the world, will „Make Life Better“, and also looks like a certain multi bagger.IMHO BioLargo is one of the best investing opportunities out there - the perfect combination - investing in the “clean” future while going for the big bucks.

6,ALL," In case you missed it- This is a must-read Article to get an idea of what might happen very soon.[Five Top Contenders Competing For Multi-Billion-Dollar PFAS Removal Race - One Appears To Have Formidable Competitive Advantages](https://stocktwits.com/julianjakobi/message/307887237)

(this was blocked by a reddit spam filter - that is why I am linking it now to the StockTwits post that has the right link)

This Micro Cap looks like to have a massive competitive advantage in comparison to some global players. Trials at huge municipal wastewater sites are already scheduled - latest when they will get positive data will be multiplying.

Within a few Qs we will know if we will have hit the Clean Earth/Clean Tech Jackpot.. It appears that it is the right time, right place for BioLargo’s AEC - as of now the best performing targeted PFAS Collector out there. 

The stars keep aligning nicely- and this could become massive. The CEO about how they’ll target the PFAS problem globally:

“I suspect that we will have many, many partners and we’ll have many, many distributors and it’s Going to keep us busy for the next 20 years. “

There are many other projects happening but this Opportunity is certainly the largest. 

I think it is looking great that this tiny company will provide one of the PFAS cleaning solutions. 

The opportunity is that big ($1 TRiLLION) that even the smallest market share would catapult us Into the stratosphere. 

When people will realize that ALL of BLGO (4 subsidiaries, 20 patents, plus Asia joint venture) etc.) is currently worth only $45 Millions but might provide a “green” go-to solution for one of THE global contamination problem, and has the potential to jump multiple Xs on great trials news, paired with the MASSIVE de risk of this investment as they are debt-free now- We should see a lot more investors discovering this company and many more leaving the sidelines to join the ride or add to their positions. Looking forward to following the story as it continuously progresses. 

I expect a minimum of 4-8X in price until EOY 2022 and no limit to the upside in the long run. This could very well become a multi-billion dollar company in the future (that would translate to 40X plus).",julian_jakobi,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/oc4byg/168_billion_water_bill_just_passed_biolargo_dd/h3t25xy/,0.043,0.818,0.139,0.9891
