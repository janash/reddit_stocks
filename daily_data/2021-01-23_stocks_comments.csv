It is rude to bet against the Come line. You bet the Come line. It is like shorting a stock. But whatever. 

There has proven to be consequences to shorting GME in this age. Brilliant. It’s amazing that people are committing capital (real money) to squeeze them. Options are crazy and I can’t think of a trade.

Also, there may have been a couple brokers closing out people's positions that they couldn't support at the halts and reselling those short positions to other people (at the higher price) that could support it more; which is why it tanked some after the halts. So some shorts got closed out and replaced by new shorts.

And that has nothing to do with the pandemic and how many stores are closed and that many people don't want to go to stores even if they are open, yet look for something to do at home so they buy video games? I would be shocked if next year their e-commerce revenue doesn't go down.

Despite all that, their store revenue is still 65% of the business. Except with less customers (if more buy online) those stores will be losing even more money. Will GameStop become a online physical copy retailer long term? We'll see but I'd say unlikely that works well. Not when Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo and Steam are the main competitors and gaming subscriptions are on the rise.

And even if it goes well. To be worth 14B as a retailer, they'd have to turn that 600M deficit into something like a 500M profit. That's a massive shift that represents roughly 15% of their total expenses.

Edit: they won't sell to cover losses, they'll have to buy to cover losses, sending the price higher. They owe 140% of the shares. Only 100% of the shares exist.

So let's say you think GME is going to $420.69 and I'm a bear who thinks it's done and the squeeze won't happen.  I'll sell you that 210129GME$115c for let's just say $50. If GME is above $115.50 (stock price plus the $50 you paid divided by 100 shares) on Jan 29 at 4pm est, you've made money. You then ""exercise"" the contract and I now have to sell you 100 shares for $115 each - which you can immediately turn around and sell for current market value.

A put option is basically the same thing, but in reverse. You're paying for the option to SELL 100 shares at the strike price, on that date. I'd be offering to buy them from you at that price - even if the price of the stock goes to 0. So you could buy the 100 shares on the market for peanuts and make me buy them for the strike price.

You can also turn around and sell an option to someone else - so if GME shoots up to $200 on Jan 26, maybe someone is now willing to buy that contract from you for $8500 ($200-115=85, times 100 shares). If you're worried that your 420.69 prediction was a bit too optimistic, you could sell and make $8450 profit.

325,DD,"The risks really depend on what you see as the full value of the stock. For example, some short sellers think the true value is $20. Because these are stocks, and not options, the most you can lose is if the price were to drop from where you buy down to 20.

However, a lot of other people think that the full value of the stock is actually much higher - between 70 and $100, or more. This is based upon Ryan Cohen turning GameStop around like he did chewy.com.  stock until it reaches that fair value.

But what has happened currently with the stock is detached from fundamentals. It's a technical issue. If you read those two DD posts I linked, it might help you understand what a gamma squeezes and what a short squeezes. Basically too many people borrowed shares thinking that the price would fall. As the price rises from retail investments, these short sellers have to buy shares to cover their short sales. That drives the price higher. 

You can look up the VW short squeeze of 2008 to understand where this could go in the short-term, before it returns to a fundamental value.

- Long whale MMs continue to buy up GME shares, lending to higher stock prices, but not precipitous climbs like today's
- Long whale MMs buy new OTM call options like crazy, or perhaps short-sellers do as well in order to hedge their shorts should a squeeze happen or just a continued bull run
- GME dips as there is no gamma left for accelerated price increase, then either big MMs get a gamma squeeze downward, or bullish long whale investors get in a bigger position stabilizing any downward trend. I am confident big institutions have their eyes on this play, this is not driven by the little guys so much anymore. Just look at the volume. 192M traded, yet two weeks ago average volume traded was just 10M or less
- Continued pressure and short interest leads to short coverage, creating a bull run or even a true short-squeeze
- From any of these scenarios, high volume and large volume of buys continues to deplete the float to nothing -- more margin calls leads to hedge firms and MMs covering their shorts and possibly beginning a short-squeeze

If a short seller borrows from one brokerage and sells on another that share can be re-shorted and counted twice.

They are now on Generation 3 of Ryzen and still nothing from Intel in sight.

Usually I would say yes it is a game of poker. But you also know that since the market crash in 2020, this game of poker has shifted from gambling to something different. Everyone knows how inflated the stock market has become since March last year. Pick a random stock and there's a good chance it's up 30% or more since March lows.

That's most people's guess, that is the only uncertainty, his exact business strategy, but its safe enough to bet that he has a good one.

My point in all this is that for GME, I don't think any of the people who had invested in December viewed this as a YOLO gamble. Maybe people are doing that now, not knowing much, but this started with a ton of research on fundamentals, the board and possibilities of how Cohen might navigate himself to a CEO or board director position, and how Gamestop would change their business strategies.

If people knew who Ryan Cohen was, and his history and what he has been doing since Chewy, they would understand that he intends to take Gamestop and pivot the business around to become an e-commerce videogame giant in the industry. That's most people's guess, that is the only uncertainty, his exact business strategy, but its safe enough to bet that he has a good one.

My point in all this is that for GME, I don't think any of the people who had invested in December viewed this as a YOLO gamble. Maybe people are doing that now, not knowing much, but this started with a ton of research on fundamentals, the board and possibilities of how Cohen might navigate himself to a CEO or board director position, and how Gamestop would change their business strategies. They've actually already started to do this as early as 2019, when they started consolidating stores, paying off debts, creating a large free cash flow, and making board adjustments, adding Reggie Fils-Aime in 2020, and now Ryan and his Chewy CFO and COO in 2021.

I could talk about all of the DD and TA for many more paragraphs, but I don't suppose anyone is looking to hear that.

But even a simple 6 month, 1 month, or 1 week chart analysis is bullish, the 200MA has crossed the 50MA (golden cross), tons of candlestick patterns, cup and handle etc. A simple SOTP analysis shows GME on their current fundamentals alone has a suppressed stock price of 4x underevaluation (well that was back when GME was at 20, so around 70 or 80 for current balance sheet), but that doesn't even price in future value, that's for hitting like a P/E of 1",0.051,0.859,0.09,0.9683

466,GPS,"Windows is a general purpose OS. Real-time means at the moment of happening. RTOS are more used for time critical applications. 

Doesn't matter how heavy the load is or how many things the OS needs to handle, it should finish each task within a certain time. RTOS are good in scheduling their resources to ensure that tasks are executed in time. Tasks get priorities to make sure they get more attention. 

Let's say in Windows you are playing a game that requires a lot of effort from your CPU and then you decide to also run several memory intensive programs and open a very large excel file. Loading that large file will take a lot longer than when you wouldn't have all those other programs running.
RTOS should handle that better, of course there are limits, but with an RTOS you guarantee that a certain task will always be finished within a certain amount of time depending on the priority of that task. 

You don't want your self driving car to be slower at processing the images and sensor data because you turned on the radio and but on your blinker and are using your GPS. This is an example of course, because those things will normally have their own system handeling those tasks.

485,BB,BB is not great for a long position please actually know what the fuck you are investing it. Literally no one has said anything about the future outlook other than they won a settlement with Facebook that both parties signed NDAs on and we won’t ever know the true outcome. All the speculation is around the partnership with AWS mainly to build software for automotive partnership they have. But that is a big if and even if it succeeds no one really knows how profitable if any the upside to that partnership would be. The reason it’s moving at all right now is pure speculation and the fact that it has momentum. The second it slows down at all it will drop until news comes of what the settlement actually means for the company.

BB and Amazon has IVY for cars, apps will be created and all sensors will be able to communicate. For example, it will play different music depending who is driving, will alert you if your kid or pet is left in the car, all this for a subscription.

I've been in the market for a little over one month now and I'm up around $2000 USD from $15,000. I've seen my highest returns today, I made 800$ from PLTR jumping up 25% this morning. NIO did great for me too. Definitely felt good seeing that return but I'm in for the long term and am expecting their to be dips, I also am keeping a little money on the side lines to invest in case of a potential crash.

As for your question I think this market is just super bullish right now and it's very easy to make money off of these super high growth stocks right now. I'm not really sure though and I'm curious to hear what other people say. I feel like pulling out some profits from my individual investments and throwing them into my ETFs might be safer if everything goes down a while but right now everything just seems to be going up. But like I said i'm very fresh to the market and still have a lot to learn.

Answer to your Q:

If your account say has $600 total value -- 500 own money, $100 borrowed to buy 5 shares GME @ $20. With 75% margin requirement, a call will be triggered if any occurs:

1. your account value falls below $400 ($100 / (1-0.75))

2. if GME price falls below $80 ($400 account value requirement / 5 GME shares on margin) AND you don't have cash/other stocks in account to cover the 400

666,GME,">I dont know whether I bought it with margin.

Think of margin like a credit limit on a credit card. Your buying power represents your cash in hand + the amount you can put on your margin ""credit card"". If you buy  on margin, your cash balance will be a negative number (because you now owe your broker and will be charged interest). To avoid buying on margin, just make sure you have the cash for your purchase available in your account before you buy (or transfer it in just after). If you have the cash to cover your purchase in your account it will always be bought with cash rather than margin.

The email you got is saying your broker will now only lend you 25% of what you're wanting to buy, rather than 50%. They may have sent this email to everyone holding GME regardless of whether or not it was purchased on margin.

Tl:dr; look at your cash balance rather than your buying power. If your cash is 0 or positive, you have not purchased anything on margin. If your cash balance is negative, you have borrowed money from your broker (aka you purchased on margin).",0.053,0.849,0.097,0.8074

They do have $100m potential shelf offering in their pocket, which I actually think would be a positive thing down the road because they can use those proceeds to payback debt, therefore increasing their bond ratings and attracting institutional investors that once couldn’t put their money in because of their current bond ratings.

713,GME,"What you need to understand with GME is pretty much the same as with any stock.

Stocks do not have their own value. They are worth nothing if no one buys (or for that matter sells) them. 0. The entire value of stocks comes for multiple reasons but this is why P&D is so effective. 

The main reasons companies go up is usually:

\-Potential

\-Accomplishments

Since certain companies also pay dividends there is a solid interest in getting in as low as possible and once the value goes far up related to their increasing income you earn more (technically, in theory).

But the other side is what was done at the same time, ""artificially"" bloating the value of a stock. Gotta put that in quotation marks because even with great innovations and profit, if a company is not in the eyes of a large audience the stock price will barely change - so the artificial bloating is mostly spreading awareness. In some cases, this causes the stock to reach a value that fits alongside the market and is considered normal, while previously being undervalued.

In GMEs case their value dropped for a reason, they are highly outdated and made their moves way too late. They have a technically promising future, but only if they manage to speed up a lot without sinking on the way AND have to compete in an established, fully satisfied market, which is never easy.

So GMEs value is right now not bond to potential or accomplishments, but purely to artificial bloating. This is pretty much what happens in a P&D, and if you have ever seen one or invested while one was going on, that's the answer as to what could happen. Since this case here is more of a fight to cause certain market reactions, it might go on for a while. It might actually go on for insanely long and be a back and forth. Due to this entire thing GME has gotten more attention than in ever, meaning more people will jump on buying the stocks. It doesn't matter if only 1/100 that hear about it invest into it, if 100.000 people see it that's 1000 new investor meaning higher demand, meaning less supply.

The main danger in this thing is those tipping over that hold the most value right now. If they decide to leave the boat, either because they don't see a point in continuing because they made xx millions or start having a feeling the fight is turning and they will lose their profit slowly but surely, then they will jump off. GME will fall hard at that point, really hard. Usually with P&D the fall is fast to a certain degree but caught by the amount of new investors not understanding what's going on. For GME, most know what's going on and I would be very surprised if people haven't set up stop loss orders close to the current price, maybe 10% below it.",0.058,0.789,0.153,0.9937

None I know of can keep that up for 10 years.   I would love for somebody to give me a historical sample of one that did.

At any rate that would assume that a company valued at 60 x sales will stay flat for 10 years until it grows into its valuation.   Not gonna happen.  It will lose about 80% of its value fairly soon and then if it does continue to grow will over time gain back its lost value.

This is a very risky move, because if the price goes up and not down, you've already sold the shares at a cheaper price and now you have to buy them back at a more expensive price to close your position. The potential loss is massive.

If the stock price starts to move up dramatically, the banks may margin call you, making you put up collateral to cover potential losses. If it goes up too much, you will probably have to bite the bullet and buy the shares to cover your short.

When GME went from $15 to $35, this put the short sellers in a bind. Do they continue to short? Or do they eat the losses. Most continued to short.

There's a few other things that could trigger a run up, thus ""squeezing the shorts""

One being call options being exercised. Many in the money options expired today. Those getting. Exercised forced the banks that sold those options to buy the stock at current value and sell them to you at the lower strike price. This buying helped build upward momentum. The stock goes up to $55, and now some large short sellers start to run for cover and buy to cut their losses, more upward movement.

Once one big position starts to cover, it creates a chain reaction because as the price moves up, more short sellers are forced to cover, making the price move exponentially.

One more thing is the fact that since more shares were shorted than are actually available on the open market, (I believe that at one point WSB claimed to hold about 8% of the total shares on the market) that meant that all those short sellers running to cover their positions are trying to buy stock that nobody has to sell them.

Did my best to explain what a short squeeze is while typing on a mobile phone. I'm sure it's not the most perfect explanation, sorry if I missed anything.

One more thing to note. A really good short squeeze is rare because it needs some really perfect conditions to align. (Very high percentage of shares are shorted, unexpected upward catalyst, low percentage of shares available on open market, bonus if high amount of long calls sold)",0.081,0.842,0.077,0.0275

857,CBOE,"GME Infinite Gamma Squeeze | Gap In Option Market Structure | Once In a Lifetime Opportunity

# Context

What happened last week with GME stock price and option was a combination of a gamma squeeze \[1\] and infinite short squeeze \[2\]. For the first time in financial history all GME call options are in the money (ITM) because the highest call strike price set by the CBOE for Januaray 29, 2021 is $60.

**Note:** A primer on gamma squeeze:

h[ttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme\_i\_think\_this\_is\_a\_gamma\_squeeze\_where\_dealers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/)

Market Maker \[1\] are in a condition never observed in financial history. Hundred of thousands of retail (wsb) are buying the GME 60C across the options calendar and MM can't hedge properly because there are not enough GME shares to buy to properly financially hedge (accounting for the interest rate to borrow)

# Market Structure

To summarize the market structure:

1. Few GME shares to hedge.
2. Hundreds of thousands of (wsb) are buying the GME 60C because of the infinite short squeeze.
3. January 29, 2021 60C call option are the highest one on the option change for that date.
4. Conditions for Infinite Gamma Squeeze & Infinite Short Squeeze

As you may now realize --(MM and brokers) hope you don't -- there is a gap in the market structure that leaves them (MM/Citadel) vulnerable to massive losses.

# Infinite Gamma Squeeze

***Should*** **million of retails (wsb) buy the Januray 29, 2021 60C weekly on Monday, this will create an infinite gamma squeeze because MM still can't properly hedge, and are forced to buy shares at whatever price to hedge. MM doing so, forces brokers to margin call the shorts caught in their infinite short squeeze. Both conditions are pro-cyclical and feed on each other in an infinite feedback loop** ***so long as more an more retails buy the GME 60C.***

There is a chance that MM can dump the shares they bought to hedged the gamma steepening and call buying \[1\]. However, doing so does not make them market neutral. It effectively turns MM into a hedge fund. SEC may allow them to get away from this momentarily.

**However, after the MM dump shares in an attempt to stop the infinite gamma squeeze they will be net short GME shares and unhedged/not market neutral.** If after the MM dump, retails continue to buy GME shares up to the $60 price, MM will be caught in a *exponentially worse gamma squeeze*, which should GME go pass 60C (gamma bump) on the week of January 25, it would turn into the one of biggest tail risk event for the MM/Citidal.

**tldr;**

**There is a gap in the market structure so that if millions of retails buy Januray 29 GME 60C on January 25 2021, there is a high probability of both an infinite gamma and short squeeze. This has never happened in financial history. And should millions of retail buy the January 29 GME60C 2021, the losses for MM but profits for retail will be massive. Retails could see 100000% return on their weekly GME Januray 29 call options at the highest strike price.**

**Edit1:** Apparently there may be higher call prices for the January 29 2021 option chains. Fundamentally, this analysis is still correct. Should millions of retail all choose a common higher call strike price to buy (higher than 60C), the gamma squeeze will be triggered when that prices is hit.

Example:

Should millions of retail buy the January 29 70C or January 29 75C, and the infinite short squeeze continues. If the GME 70C or 75C is hit, GME share price enters a gamma squeeze.

What the MM are hoping for are twofolds:

1. They scare retails to sell below $60. This alleviates the infinite gamma squeeze. Or;
2. Retails don't all buy the same call options. But given that wsb loves high risk, I hypothesize they will all choose the furthest OTM call options.

GME at 60 is the Maginot line next week. Should it go to 75, gamma and infinite short squeeze continues. Should it fall below it, MM have won a strategic victory.

**Edit2:**

For gamma squeeze, you look at the open interest (OI) and strike price. Should the share price get close to the price with a highest open interest, that's when the gamma steepening occurs as probability goes to 1. MM have to buy shares to remain neutral as the options are now ITM.

905,GME,"I’m playing it purely for the squeeze right now.  Been watching it since September, dipping in and out, and finally decided to jump back in last week.  

Liquidated my account yesterday and went 100% GME this morning.  Was expecting bullish movement, but not to the extent it jumped today.  Actually had my sights set on early February for big moves.

I think there’s still room to run, and Monday should be exciting.  Think about this, every open call option on the option chain expired deep ITM today.  How many of those 1/22 60C do you think were either sold naked, or part of a synthetic short after brokers ran out of shares to  borrow?  There was 25K open interest on the 60C alone.  These shares will need to be delivered next week.  

It also appears that short interest is still above 100%.  To be fair, some of this may be new shorts who got in in the last 2 days, but there is a good chance of them getting blown out next week as the options from this week are settled.

I have seen it purported that today was not driven entirely by a short squeeze, and that a gamma squeeze played just as much a part in the movement, as frenetic call buying on the run up led to increasing hedging by MMs.

All things considered, it seems like GME still has legs.  With the opening of higher strike options in the option chain as of today, and the settlement of this weeks options, we may see another few days of crazy price movement.  I plan to see what the premiums are and if they look good throw in for some 1/29 100Cs.

I plan to sell incrementally on the runnup.  However, I do plan to buy back in at a smaller position after the stock stabilizes.

I believe that GME has the potential to be a good value play after the squeeze is over.

I base this on a number of factors:

1.) Ryan Cohen is a savvy, driven dude with a solid understanding of what makes a company both successful and develop a loyal user base
2.) GMEs consistent growth in digital sales 
3.) partnership with Microsoft on digital sales (I expect other developers to make similar arrangements)
4.) growth of video games and esports revenue
5.) purchasing data linked to rewards card.  GME moving to an online marketplace will allow them to monetize user data

All of these things are of course contingent on a solid road map to transition to a more e-commerce based model.  But if anyone can do it it’s Ryan Cohen, I mean, he did it for pet food.",0.015,0.825,0.16,0.9968

908,GME,"This post reflects my position on GME pretty well. I got in last week in the low 30s when it first jumped, so I'm already about 100% ROI on this. I'm planning to sell at set increments, starting over $100 and going all the way up to $1000. I'm not confident it will definitely go that high, but I believe there's a good enough chance to take this risk.

 If I end up selling all of my shares, I will be buying back in as the price settles and holding long-term. I believe this company has a chance long-term and I'm already impressed with the changes they've made in the last 12 months.

 At the start of the pandemic, their online system was a mess. I ordered a used console for pick up one day before my state suddenly shut down all retail stores, and it took 2 weeks to get this issue worked out  (the system was overwhelmed and they couldn't reroute this purchase to my home). Today, they have a very polished app and have expanded into selling other related products like gaming focused pcs, tvs, sound systems, and accessories. I also believe their new leadership with Ryan Cohen's experience are likely to further focus this company on unmet needs and potentials in the gaming market.",0.042,0.83,0.128,0.9557
