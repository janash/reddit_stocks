1,BBIG," Couple things:
- price threshold removed until til like April 3rd or forth according to the most recent filing. I see it as bullish. HBC just opened themselves to lose money? Even going short at these prices and CTB this high, returns will be diminished the second it goes down to 72 cents. 
- BBIG was death spiraled and HBC was involved. In this situation HBC is doing this thru a separate LLC and is the administrator of the warrants.
- Big M&A players involved (David kastin being the biggest player) and many potential people in on the deal stepping down on boards at the same time. 
- massive “dilution” has occurred. Without a doubt shares out standing increased, but it’s not confirmed they were released into the open market (reg sho and high CTBs prove it however, that “barcode” or “whale teeth” pattern that has been seen for weeks on the chart spells dilution but is not exclusive to dilution).

I wanna see who has those new shares out standing (obviously HBC but who is HBC potentially representing).",takenotes617,12,/r/pennystocks/comments/12053bj/bbby_technically_belongs_here_at_least_for_now/jdga9re/,0.054,0.918,0.027,-0.5826

10,RS, Agree. This stock has a RS split coming with another 600 million shares waiting to be converted from warrants. When this occurs another RS will happen. If you are wanting to invest while it’s a penny stock I’d wait till after the reverse split happens and it drops below $1 again from hbc converting all those warrants then dropping them.  Otherwise if you invested now you would probably go through two reverse splits at 1-10.,613Flyer,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/12053bj/bbby_technically_belongs_here_at_least_for_now/jdhbk7h/,0.0,0.938,0.062,0.5719
11,BBBY," Upvoted, great comment. I do think dilution into the open market is occurring though, and I’ve written some about my theories on how we are still on reg sho and why the CTB is still high. Dilution into the open market would also explain the sudden availability of shares and drop in CTB that coincided with the beginning of the funding agreement.

Regardless, I am long on BBBY, and I don’t think dilution of any kind is a big deal with this stock. Retail buy pressure is so high, and sell pressure is so low, it’s a powder keg… again, nothing I say is financial advice.",woken_somnambulist12,-6,/r/pennystocks/comments/12053bj/bbby_technically_belongs_here_at_least_for_now/jdgb792/,0.078,0.808,0.113,0.719

13,BBBY," One of the main purposes of reg sho is to ensure FTDs are eventually covered. Yes, some stocks are on reg sho for a long time with no upward price movement, but stocks that are heavily bought and held by retail like BBBY and GME run pretty reliably when they are on reg sho and a large FTD due date comes around. Examples of this are rare because the circumstances are rare, but one example is the GME sneeze, and another is BBBY last August. BBBY has been trending down through large FTD due dates for the past 6 weeks or so, IMO only because of dilution resulting from the financing deal. And in spite of this, BBBY remains on reg sho because demand is that insanely high.

As for being profitable, GME proved that under the right management profitability can be achieved, and 2 years ago GME was doing a lot of the same things BBBY is doing now - raising money by selling equity, closing unprofitable stores en masse.

18,RC," My theory: dilution to some extent has occured Not nearly as much as the bears are touting. This recent price threshold removal tells me one thing, the stocks gonna run. I’ve been saying that they are gonna heavily dilute on the next big run up (also if u think RC is involved he did that w gme to raise money, duh people).

19,BBBY," Gender doesn’t matter. I’m male, recently moved, made a lot of trips to BBBY lately.

Who wouldn’t like buying needed household goods at half the price of Amazon? And not bumping shoulders with anyone while you shop? And quick checkout at the single, empty checkout line? And on top of that, inevitably a ring up error or two in your favor?

Who doesn’t love that?!

I sure hope they can keep that up!

Now, the scary thing about this is the implications for the overall economy. Above is my true experience. They can’t get people into the store even with deep discounts.

Attention shoppers: for best results, shop at a store that is closing, realize no returns, and do sign up for the $30 optional level for their loyalty program, cause extra 20% off after all discounts even at closing stores.",ankole_watusi,0,/r/pennystocks/comments/12053bj/bbby_technically_belongs_here_at_least_for_now/jdhzzoe/,0.061,0.748,0.192,0.9654
20,BBBY," Look at the GME revenue & profit charts going back years. GME has been profitable EVERY SINGLE 4th quarter except the most recent one, where they were spending a lot on growth. 

I know the analysts got this one wrong, but the idea that GME has made an amazing turn-around and that this quarter proves it is ludicrous hopium, to me anyways. And after all the investment, the profits/revenue weren't even enough to make me think that this is sustainable into Q1. It was about enough to cover half of the previous quarter's losses. 

Let's say BBBY only goes forward with their profitable stores. How much revenue is that? How much profit? Is it enough to cover their debt going forward? Those are cold, hard numbers one could calculate.
