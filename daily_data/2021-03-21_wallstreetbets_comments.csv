You aren’t alone others that were leveraged do the same. Now all these paper hands are taking losses to get something “safe”, US dollars.

Your safe money was better off investing in a company with a low balance sheet that makes a percentage of GDP.

In other words, convert US dollars to something that will hold value. Borrowing US dollars is only tolerable if you know there’s future cash flow to cover it.

I thought that is a great idea. So my son and I grew veg in our garden. We would bag it up in to small salad bags and herb bags. I would then send my.son out with his bike and a red wagon type trailer knocking on people's doors asking if they would like fresh veg or herbs for £1 a bag. Each bag contained 2 cucumbers, 1 gem lettuce and 5 or 6 tomatoes and herb bags would be a stalk of each herb we grew.  
  
It started pretty well. My son would come back with a fair chunk of change each weekend until one day the cops picked him up and brought him home. Apparently theirs laws preventing this shit now.

133,GME," Okay so what we know (keep in mind, I’m a bus driver. Not in Wall Street or any formal schooling. Been here since the end of January. Just trying to paint us a factual picture): 

- Melvin took out a 6Billion dollar loan from someone with a BBB- rating. Which is the lowest rating you can have and still loan money out for investments. My guess is this is the only group that would give them money.
- We would have seen this pop Friday had it not been actively suppressed. There were a lot of calls on 200-250. That COULD have triggered a Gamma.
- Others have pointed out the news outlets have NEVER told the masses to sell anything for worry of “losing your money” they want GME hype to fail
- we got ER this week. 2/23 I believe. This should create some volume if the report goes well.

What are the odds that Melvin is using all that 6B solely for GME? Are they trying to make other plays? We need to get a solid picture and share it with the apes. They can see everything we post here, so the best thing we can do is make sure apes are informed.

134,GME," What makes you think hedge funds are shorting GME using ETFs? 

To short $1M worth of GME using an ETF with 1% GME in their index, they need to borrow shares in the ETF for $100M, and thus pay the borrowing fee for $100M worth of shares. 

This means that the cost to borrow will be about* 100x more when shorting GME through an ETF, compared to shorting GME directly.

*) in reality this factor may differ depending on differences in borrowing fees between GME and the ETF. Right now though, GME borrowing fees are at an all time low (0.5%) and much lower than GAMR (10.7%) which is the ETF with the highest proportion of GME shares, massively favouring shorting GME directly. 

GAMR example (400x):

According to OP, GAMR holds almost 5% GME shares. To short $1M GME we need to borrow $20M GAMR at a cost of approx $2M. This is 400x more compared to borrowing $1M GME directly at a cost of $5K.

145,ALL," SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON BORROW AVAILABILITY IN GME

There has been a lot of very inaccurate and false information being posted about the borrow availability in GME shares. The most common one is that IBorrowdesk (IBKR) is reflective of the total availability of borrow in the marketplace. THIS IS FALSE!!!  iBorrowdesk as well as most other offerings of the same sort from Fido, Schwab etc mostly just show the availability of shares on their platform at that moment in time. Ironically this means the more their clients buy GME on margin the more borrow availability there will be. 

THE REAL BORROW MARKET AVAILABILITY. 

In its most basic form, the largest holders of securities are also the largest lenders of securities. Hate to break it to y’all but there are a ton of institutional holders of this stock. When an institution such as pension fund, mutual fund insurance company buys GME ( or any other stock for that matter) those shares are held at their custodian. A Custody bank such as JPM, Citi, State Street, BONY aggregates these assets and if the pension fund is in their lending program (most are) those shares are lent to broker dealers. The large broker dealers all have Prime Brokerage groups that custody assets for Hedge Funds. One of the main functions of a Prime Broker is to lend stock to Hedge Funds to short. BDs act as the middle man between the Custody bank and the hedge fund. How does a PB know where to borrow GME you ask?  Easy, the Custody banks broadcast ALL of their stocks available for lending to Broker Dealers. The PBs aggregate this borrow availability from all of the Custody banks and broadcast this information to Hedge Funds. Included in this aggregation would be any positions that are available at the PB from their long clients who purchases those securities on margin. So each day every PB in the market aggregates all of the borrow availability they have access to and broadcasts it to HFS to short. Here’s the rub. THIS INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE TO THE  GENERAL PUBLIC!!!!!  Securities lending or stock loan is a purposely OPAQUE market. This allows the PBs to keep control over who gets borrow and at what cost.  On that topic of Cost, given that the general public does not have the same access to this information, the COST to  borrow a security can often be a more accurate reflection on borrow availability. Case in point: When GME first squeezed in late January there was ZERO borrow available to short. As such the cost to borrow the security went as high as 200%. Think about that. That high cost is untenable and impossible for a HF to stay short for very long. Obviously they covered a load of stock and the borrow cost came in and availability went back up. 

EVERY BD(PB)’s ABILITY TO BORROW STOCK IS DIFFERENT 

Think of hard to borrow securities like GME as an allocation of shares in IPO process. Not anyone can rock up and get an allocation of an IPO. The same is true of an allocation of stock borrow on a hard to borrow or “special” security like GME. The Custody bank will allocate limited shares of a hard to borrow to those borrowers (BD&PBs) that pay them the most revenue throughout the year. It stands to reason that the largest clients of the custody banks are the largest PBS that have enormous borrow demand. Thus BONY will lend GME to a GS or JPM before lending it to IBKR or Fido (both with very small PB groups). You with me so far???  So let’s look at the loan side of that transaction. BONY lends GME to GS. Now GS will lend that scarce resource of GME borrow to HF clients that pay them the most revenue throughout the year. Thus GS is more likely to lend GME in this scenario to a Citadel(I know I know), Bridgewater or DE Shaw vs a small 50mmAUM hedge fund. 

CONTROL AND AGGREGATION OF BORROW MARKET AVAILABILITY. 

Although the transparency into stock borrow availability is non existent for individual investors it is vastly different and very transparent to stock borrow participants (CUSTODY BANKS, BD/PBs). The largest stock loan participants have created an industry utility they control that aggregates each participants borrow availability. They submit total shares available for borrow by firm aggregate it all and distribute back to its participants ONLY!!!  So a stock loan trader at one of these firms can simply type in a ticker and see pretty much the entirety of the stock borrow availability as well as the cost!!! Because the BD/PBs & Custidy banks control this information they reveal only a subset to non participants such as the actual long holder (Pension plan, Mutual fund) and Hedge Funds. This is a main reason why large HFs have multiple PBs. Because everyone’s stock borrow capability is different, they want access to as many avenues to borrow stock as possible. 

The only way for an individual to anywhere close to an accurate number of borrow availability would be to call each of the large PBs and ask for the info. Obviously this is not going to happen. I happen to know several stock loan participants very well and can tell you that there are MILLIONS OF SHARES OF GME TO BORROW RIGHT NOW AND FOR THE PAST MONTH!!!!!  

Given that, the best indicator of whether or not there is a lot of borrow is the COST to borrow which is more readily available through your BD. Even if they aren’t showing you availability they probably still show the cost to borrow. Generally speaking, any cost to borrow below 10% implies there is borrow available. At .5% it is virtually a LIQUID or “GC” (general collateral) borrow. A further reference point would be RKT which squeezed several weeks ago. There was Very little to no borrow availability as evidenced by its 30% borrow cost at the time. 

Don’t even get me started on the availability of shares for retail to short. I generally DO NOT recommend retail investors going short. It is a sure fire way to go broke. That said even though your broker may show you ZERO borrow to go short, I GUARANTEE they are giving availability to their HF clients.   

Hope that helps. It does feel fairly rigged at times given the lack of borrow market transparency. I just hate to think individuals are drawing the wrong conclusions because iBorrow or their BD is showing no borrow. In the case of GME this has been the case all day today. Rest assured THERE ARE MILLIONS OF GME SHARES AVAILABLE TO SHORT.",Germanicusss,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9wwqk/gme_overview_week_of_322/grq0jgv/,0.038,0.864,0.098,0.9969

Given that, the best indicator of whether or not there is a lot of borrow is the COST to borrow which is more readily available through your BD.

147,DE," SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON BORROW AVAILABILITY IN GME

There has been a lot of very inaccurate and false information being posted about the borrow availability in GME shares. The most common one is that IBorrowdesk (IBKR) is reflective of the total availability of borrow in the marketplace. THIS IS FALSE!!!  iBorrowdesk as well as most other offerings of the same sort from Fido, Schwab etc mostly just show the availability of shares on their platform at that moment in time. Ironically this means the more their clients buy GME on margin the more borrow availability there will be. 

THE REAL BORROW MARKET AVAILABILITY. 

In its most basic form, the largest holders of securities are also the largest lenders of securities. Hate to break it to y’all but there are a ton of institutional holders of this stock. When an institution such as pension fund, mutual fund insurance company buys GME ( or any other stock for that matter) those shares are held at their custodian. A Custody bank such as JPM, Citi, State Street, BONY aggregates these assets and if the pension fund is in their lending program (most are) those shares are lent to broker dealers. The large broker dealers all have Prime Brokerage groups that custody assets for Hedge Funds. One of the main functions of a Prime Broker is to lend stock to Hedge Funds to short. BDs act as the middle man between the Custody bank and the hedge fund. How does a PB know where to borrow GME you ask?  Easy, the Custody banks broadcast ALL of their stocks available for lending to Broker Dealers. The PBs aggregate this borrow availability from all of the Custody banks and broadcast this information to Hedge Funds. Included in this aggregation would be any positions that are available at the PB from their long clients who purchases those securities on margin. So each day every PB in the market aggregates all of the borrow availability they have access to and broadcasts it to HFS to short. Here’s the rub. THIS INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE TO THE  GENERAL PUBLIC!!!!!  Securities lending or stock loan is a purposely OPAQUE market. This allows the PBs to keep control over who gets borrow and at what cost.  On that topic of Cost, given that the general public does not have the same access to this information, the COST to  borrow a security can often be a more accurate reflection on borrow availability. Case in point: When GME first squeezed in late January there was ZERO borrow available to short. As such the cost to borrow the security went as high as 200%. Think about that. That high cost is untenable and impossible for a HF to stay short for very long. Obviously they covered a load of stock and the borrow cost came in and availability went back up. 

EVERY BD(PB)’s ABILITY TO BORROW STOCK IS DIFFERENT 

Think of hard to borrow securities like GME as an allocation of shares in IPO process. Not anyone can rock up and get an allocation of an IPO. The same is true of an allocation of stock borrow on a hard to borrow or “special” security like GME. The Custody bank will allocate limited shares of a hard to borrow to those borrowers (BD&PBs) that pay them the most revenue throughout the year. It stands to reason that the largest clients of the custody banks are the largest PBS that have enormous borrow demand. Thus BONY will lend GME to a GS or JPM before lending it to IBKR or Fido (both with very small PB groups). You with me so far???  So let’s look at the loan side of that transaction. BONY lends GME to GS. Now GS will lend that scarce resource of GME borrow to HF clients that pay them the most revenue throughout the year. Thus GS is more likely to lend GME in this scenario to a Citadel(I know I know), Bridgewater or DE Shaw vs a small 50mmAUM hedge fund. 

CONTROL AND AGGREGATION OF BORROW MARKET AVAILABILITY. 

Although the transparency into stock borrow availability is non existent for individual investors it is vastly different and very transparent to stock borrow participants (CUSTODY BANKS, BD/PBs). The largest stock loan participants have created an industry utility they control that aggregates each participants borrow availability. They submit total shares available for borrow by firm aggregate it all and distribute back to its participants ONLY!!!  So a stock loan trader at one of these firms can simply type in a ticker and see pretty much the entirety of the stock borrow availability as well as the cost!!! Because the BD/PBs & Custidy banks control this information they reveal only a subset to non participants such as the actual long holder (Pension plan, Mutual fund) and Hedge Funds. This is a main reason why large HFs have multiple PBs. Because everyone’s stock borrow capability is different, they want access to as many avenues to borrow stock as possible. 

The only way for an individual to anywhere close to an accurate number of borrow availability would be to call each of the large PBs and ask for the info. Obviously this is not going to happen.

The PBs aggregate this borrow availability from all of the Custody banks and broadcast this information to Hedge Funds. Included in this aggregation would be any positions that are available at the PB from their long clients who purchases those securities on margin. So each day every PB in the market aggregates all of the borrow availability they have access to and broadcasts it to HFS to short. Here’s the rub. THIS INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE TO THE  GENERAL PUBLIC!!!!!  Securities lending or stock loan is a purposely OPAQUE market. This allows the PBs to keep control over who gets borrow and at what cost.  On that topic of Cost, given that the general public does not have the same access to this information, the COST to  borrow a security can often be a more accurate reflection on borrow availability. Case in point: When GME first squeezed in late January there was ZERO borrow available to short. As such the cost to borrow the security went as high as 200%. Think about that. That high cost is untenable and impossible for a HF to stay short for very long. Obviously they covered a load of stock and the borrow cost came in and availability went back up. 

EVERY BD(PB)’s ABILITY TO BORROW STOCK IS DIFFERENT 

Think of hard to borrow securities like GME as an allocation of shares in IPO process. Not anyone can rock up and get an allocation of an IPO. The same is true of an allocation of stock borrow on a hard to borrow or “special” security like GME. The Custody bank will allocate limited shares of a hard to borrow to those borrowers (BD&PBs) that pay them the most revenue throughout the year. It stands to reason that the largest clients of the custody banks are the largest PBS that have enormous borrow demand. Thus BONY will lend GME to a GS or JPM before lending it to IBKR or Fido (both with very small PB groups). You with me so far???  So let’s look at the loan side of that transaction. BONY lends GME to GS. Now GS will lend that scarce resource of GME borrow to HF clients that pay them the most revenue throughout the year. Thus GS is more likely to lend GME in this scenario to a Citadel(I know I know), Bridgewater or DE Shaw vs a small 50mmAUM hedge fund. 

CONTROL AND AGGREGATION OF BORROW MARKET AVAILABILITY. 

Although the transparency into stock borrow availability is non existent for individual investors it is vastly different and very transparent to stock borrow participants (CUSTODY BANKS, BD/PBs). The largest stock loan participants have created an industry utility they control that aggregates each participants borrow availability. They submit total shares available for borrow by firm aggregate it all and distribute back to its participants ONLY!!!  So a stock loan trader at one of these firms can simply type in a ticker and see pretty much the entirety of the stock borrow availability as well as the cost!!! Because the BD/PBs & Custidy banks control this information they reveal only a subset to non participants such as the actual long holder (Pension plan, Mutual fund) and Hedge Funds. This is a main reason why large HFs have multiple PBs. Because everyone’s stock borrow capability is different, they want access to as many avenues to borrow stock as possible. 

The only way for an individual to anywhere close to an accurate number of borrow availability would be to call each of the large PBs and ask for the info. Obviously this is not going to happen. I happen to know several stock loan participants very well and can tell you that there are MILLIONS OF SHARES OF GME TO BORROW RIGHT NOW AND FOR THE PAST MONTH!!!!!  

Given that, the best indicator of whether or not there is a lot of borrow is the COST to borrow which is more readily available through your BD. Even if they aren’t showing you availability they probably still show the cost to borrow. Generally speaking, any cost to borrow below 10% implies there is borrow available. At .5% it is virtually a LIQUID or “GC” (general collateral) borrow. A further reference point would be RKT which squeezed several weeks ago. There was Very little to no borrow availability as evidenced by its 30% borrow cost at the time. 

Don’t even get me started on the availability of shares for retail to short. I generally DO NOT recommend retail investors going short. It is a sure fire way to go broke. That said even though your broker may show you ZERO borrow to go short, I GUARANTEE they are giving availability to their HF clients.   

Hope that helps. It does feel fairly rigged at times given the lack of borrow market transparency. I just hate to think individuals are drawing the wrong conclusions because iBorrow or their BD is showing no borrow. In the case of GME this has been the case all day today.

153,PB," SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON BORROW AVAILABILITY IN GME

There has been a lot of very inaccurate and false information being posted about the borrow availability in GME shares. The most common one is that IBorrowdesk (IBKR) is reflective of the total availability of borrow in the marketplace. THIS IS FALSE!!!  iBorrowdesk as well as most other offerings of the same sort from Fido, Schwab etc mostly just show the availability of shares on their platform at that moment in time. Ironically this means the more their clients buy GME on margin the more borrow availability there will be. 

THE REAL BORROW MARKET AVAILABILITY. 

In its most basic form, the largest holders of securities are also the largest lenders of securities. Hate to break it to y’all but there are a ton of institutional holders of this stock. When an institution such as pension fund, mutual fund insurance company buys GME ( or any other stock for that matter) those shares are held at their custodian. A Custody bank such as JPM, Citi, State Street, BONY aggregates these assets and if the pension fund is in their lending program (most are) those shares are lent to broker dealers. The large broker dealers all have Prime Brokerage groups that custody assets for Hedge Funds. One of the main functions of a Prime Broker is to lend stock to Hedge Funds to short. BDs act as the middle man between the Custody bank and the hedge fund. How does a PB know where to borrow GME you ask?  Easy, the Custody banks broadcast ALL of their stocks available for lending to Broker Dealers.

174,GME," It's bitter truth but HF's strategy is working. Apes are not able to buy with same momentum like before and HFs are able to borrow shorts cheaper to push the price down successfully with the attacks. They are able to drive down the price from 349 down to 172 ish in 2 weeks. It keeps going up at times but again they are able to push it down. They may push the price further down by end of next week in 100s. There are number of posts going around about how HFs are out of ammo etc. which is definitely not true. If they would have lost it then there would have been a repeat of Jan 2021 situation.

The only few catalyst we can hope for are:

1. Huge announcement on 23rd and fomo kicks in with added help from stimmi (Also, for the worst, if the anti-fomo kicks in if the earnings on 23rd are not good then paper apes will start dumping the stock and HF will surely win. :( :( )
2. 1 or more whales (cathie or chamath etc. ) jumping in the long GME game
3. Price drops to 100s and apes + whales jump in in large numbers due to lower price point.

Other than that, sadly looks like HF are winning. :(

We need to build momentum or something needs to happen. If this drags on then it's the games of who blinks first. Unfortunately, at that game, apes are likely to lose. Apes needs to pay bills more frequently than HFs. Let's pray for the best. Either ways, I am holding on to my 100 🦍

A lot of these new ‘job offers’ specify that the applicant should have significant profile strength on social media - looking at your impressive karma score, I’d say you fit the bill. Also, not two weeks ago you posted a well-received motivational discussion about how GME is a symbol of power - quite the difference in attitude to this comment, eh?

I completely understand if you did take the job. It just might be some of the easiest money you’ve ever made, and I wouldn’t be surprised if you were planning to invest it all into GME. If so, I salute you. Now, your comment is clearly an attempt to spread FUD, and apes have endured enough of that over the last few weeks to not even bat an eyelid as they read this comment while downvoting it with their ever-stronger diamond hands.

I know this, because if you were truly worried that we were losing this war, you’d keep it to yourself instead of projecting your doubts on others. If you want to this squeeze to happen, you would acknowledge that this is a psychological game and you’d influence others to buy and hold, even if you believed we were doomed.

182,GME," 175 is the point this week where puts outweigh calls.

Last week, that number was actually 150.

They couldn't get it anywhere close to 150.

The next biggest call to put ratio swing was at 200.

Even below 200, call would have outweighed puts, but being above 200 had a significantly more amount of calls ITM than puts.

I'm assuming the same thing will happen this week. If they can't get the price below 175, they're going to try to at least keep it below 200. If GME jumps to say 300, they may have to adjust and try to get it to at least below 250. 

Their strategy for the week is going to depend on what happens with the price throughout the week. I'm not saying that GME will drop to 175. I'm just saying that if GME starts the week at 200, they're most likely going to try and play for 175.",Corno4825,20,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9wwqk/gme_overview_week_of_322/grq6ccc/,0.017,0.956,0.027,0.1531

A month ago many would have said that 200 was unreasonable. In fact, many HFs were happy to sell calls at 200 thinking it was unreasonable. However, general sentiment for the stock is now that $200 is not only reasonable, but reasonable enough to be valued at over $200 for almost 2 weeks. That's the entire reason why 200 was such an important price point for them last week. They didn't sell those OTM calls last week, they sold them weeks if not months ago. 

800 may seem unreasonable for you now, but what matters is not what you as an individual thinks, but what the market as a whole thinks. That's why the stock market changes every day.

Of course the volume @ 500, 600 + 690 is pretty huge.

Anyway if a squeeze happened now, looks like it'd be pretty difficult to get close to 500.

GME would need some sort of catalyst to get some momentum on the way to $250 + we would need to fill in the gaps on calls b/t 4-600.

210,TD," For the service of being connected to financial markets (which requires a great deal of capital investment, time, and risk to make happen), you should expect to pay a fee.  In general, these fees have been getting lower and lower over time.  Now, many retail traders get ""free"" fees on their trades... so who is paying for all this infrastructure?

Well, you're still paying.  The way it works is that smarter market participants pay for the right to see your order first, which gives them the option to trade with you before your smooth-brained order hits the open market.  If you're doing something dumb, these smarter participants trade with you directly, make a profit, and give some back to the referrer (ETrade, Robin Hood, TD Ameritrade, etc).

In this way, everyone wins.  You execute your order exactly as you wanted (actually, often at *better* prices since PFOF often involves price *improvement* for the retail trader) AND you don't have to pay commissions.  If you're actually an autist, this is about as good as it gets.  You get prices *better* than if you were a professional trader!

It's popular to say that everything is a scam these days, but PFOF is just a good business model in which everyone benefits.  I'm sure this will get auto-removed, but maybe at least OP will see it.

1. Madoff creates Payment for Order Flow early in his career.
2. Madoff realizes that he can use this as a Ponzi scheme. Essentially taking peoples orders, buy in under-regulated dark pools, use it to manipulate the price.
3. Takes what he has learned and goes for the big bucks with the Whales and eventually gets arrested for the biggest Ponzi scheme in history.
4. Bad faith actors catch on to PFOF and how you can use it to manipulate market.
5. PFOF becomes the dominate method for brokers with Citadel being the hub. All is fine and dandy until GME exposes the irregularities in the market caused by PFOF, exacerbated by Citadels' panic to cover and hide shorts.

228,UI," I like its UI. Quite beautiful on a mobile app. Sometimes I even use it to stare at stock price just like Robinhood App.

As for strictly trading purposes, it is absolute garbage. If you look at its 606 Form, WeBull takes almost a dollar per 100 S&P500 stocks. Robinhood in meantime only takes 40 cents a dollar per 100 S&P500 stocks.

My experience with WeBull has been it definitely trades slower than the big brokerages (irrelevant to PFOF). Merrill Edge average execution speed is 0.012 seconds and Fidelity is 0.08s econds. I don't know about Robinhood and WeBull but those two does feel noticeably slower overall.

That said, PFOF is highly overstated. It's generally fractions of a penny to about a penny per trade. A penny here and there shouldn't kill you. Honestly, PFOF is overall a good change in this industry because it made brokerages go from charging $4.99 a trade to commission free (with PFOF of about a penny or two here and there).

253,GME," Ya. Fidelity became famous because of its Magellan Fund back when Peter Lynch ran it (Peter Lynch owns a part of Fidelity). Peter Lynch was a genius investor who averaged 29% a year and remains the best performing mutual fund investor in history over such extended period.

(and his return after mutual fund can be followed through his wife's IRA (1974 to today): [https://afterdinnerinvestor.com/peter-lynch-wifes-retirement-account/](https://afterdinnerinvestor.com/peter-lynch-wifes-retirement-account/))

It's first a mutual fund company. Everything about Fidelity is geared towards long term investing. There's just more money to be made in asset management (Fidelity manages $9.8 trillion in total customer assets).

Finding a way to get even 0.2% a year from customer assets is like almost $20 billion a year. (Robinhood's entire AUM before GME meltdown was about $20 billion)

That said, Fidelity is trying to keep up with times. That's the entire premise of Fidelity Spire app it is trying to work on now (cause a lot of Robinhood converts are demanding it).

I'm guessing Fidelity is seeing this more as an investment opportunity for the next generation to prefer its brokerage for long term investing over other brokerages.

&#x200B;

It's probably why Fidelity really doesn't care what happens to GME.

The goal is simple for Fidelity. Attract customer base. Convert some of them to long term investors at Fidelity. And continue the tradition cause who cares about traders when the real trillions are in asset management. At this rate, Fidelity might be managing like $20 trillion in total customer assets in the next decade.

It's literally the biggest money making machine. People will always have long term investment accounts. And considering US Stock Market historically doubled every 7 years, even the smallest fee from that total customer asset is... quite unfathomable. Makes even the total profits of top hedge funds bring a joke (when you consider profit per work involved). And best part, Fidelity doesn't have to do anything special. It just literally needs to continue being Fidelity and let customers keep trusting in Fidelity.

&#x200B;

the volume is low also in canadian markets, making manipulation ALOT easier, in the stock im in, it has like 100-200k volume with 60-80% of that volume being shorts.  100shares pending the time can lower the price of the stock significantly.

&#x200B;

luckily im in love with the company and love the actually business side of things along with the staff, watch all the presentations i can get my hands on and loving the progression of the company over time so i can handle seeing swings in the stock over and over again.

&#x200B;

and yes im a degen, and actually have 95%+ of my portfolio in this small canadian OTC looking to get the almighty tendies!!!  (only 17k usd) so, seeing the gains over the past year has been amazing, but the last 8 months have been a roller coaster between 3.50$ - 7.00$ month after month it swings up, then down and all based on very low volume.

MS in feb 2021 said Pltr is underweight but upped the PT to $19 (from $15 in November) in October MS acquired Eaton Vance. EV and MS have been gobbling up shares (I believe EV has a $16 cost basis...) it’s safe to say that at the top levels of MS they know more about PLTR then 99% of government employees. They just want cheap shares... institutional ownership is at about 17/18%... they’re coming to load up..

356,IBM, I don't know the exact detail on which client goes through IBM vs AWS. IMO if I'm a public sector agency I'd consider IBM + PLTR because of the hybrid cloud infrastructrure over AWS's focus on public cloud. Historically PLTR has worked well on AWS and Azure so I don't think this is a major issue. Palantir also has their own data sharing and security measures to manage the risk. I suppose an absolute no no for Palantir will be Snowflake but if they partner with each other it'd be fun to watch for sure.

365,AI," PLTR does have its own AI. You can read it in their Titan release (but I'm sure they've had AI technology way before today). I think intelligence augmentation is more about using AI to help companies make decisions. The artificial intelligence way of thinking about AI is to fully automate processes so no human is involved (like Tesla's FSD, Google's search engine, IBM Deep Blue, etc). Doesn't really matter now as Palantir's OS is now integrated with IBM Watson through the IBM partnership.

Google can certainly enter the game and compete against PLTR for sure even though they'd be some years behind and might not have a clear edge for a while. The challenge with Google is because they're large, it is difficult for them to justify putting money into Palantir's target market because right now (or previously) it is still smaller than Google's other revenue pools and most of their focus is in AI not data integration. Google is also not exactly a company that is focused on enterprise software like Microsoft, IBM, Oracle so they don't have much of a competitive advantage in this space. Also, Google would be limited to its own cloud market share which isn't great - it is unlikely that they can partner with Azure or AWS to cover a larger customer base since these are all direct competitors.

You can watch the lead engineer of the neural net system talk at AI industry events. See the challenges they are solving which are bleeding edge in the tech world. 

You can watch the videos of the very few folks with the FSD Beta. See it improve from week to week with only a MINUSCULE amount of miles driven by the fleet. 

It is YEARS ahead of the competition. And it is just around the corner. (Beta is expanding to 1,000 or so very soon, with many more shortly after that.)

There are going to be goofs, accidents, probably even a few deaths (as expected no matter who’s driving). The media will FEAST on these ‘missteps’ (as they do with the most trivial ‘nothingburgergates’ with Apple).

That won’t change the fact that for YEARS Tesla is going to have the only car that provides consumers Level 4 autonomy on all public roads.

Elon and everybody else tout Level 5 autonomy, but Level 4 is the world-changer. 

Level 4 can drive with no driver in most circumstances, pulling over safely and calling for help when it’s not confident. Level 4 lets your car pick you up from the bar. Lets you share your wife’s car when she’s in a 3h marathon with her boyfriend. Lets you send your car out to go earn you money.

Level 5 is doing all that, but in ‘all’ circumstances instead of most.

When you think about it, there really is no such thing as Level 5. Humans can’t drive in all situations, so arguably aren’t Level 5. Level 5 is just a point where we say Level 4 is more capable than an arbitrary percentage of human drivers.

Alot of the future ev stuff from current car makers are just legacy chassis with a battery added. I think the assistance Hyundai had from canoo and arrival, and mitsubishi who are partnering with an ev start up, shows how far behind some major auto manufacturers are and want to get a head start.

Everything for the major manufacturers is geared for ICE production - assembly lines, component lines, engineers etc and it's going to take a long time to transition. 

It's why I think companies like canoo have a great advantage as they can cut down on years of r and d and crash testing for larger companies. Yes many ev company start ups are trash, but you have to look at the bigger picture with some. I think just basing your judgement on canoo based on how may vehicles they can produce as a yard stick for competency is a tad ignorant.

They earned a ton of respect from me the way they have seemed to be 100% honest throughout the whole production/R&D process. No fancy unrealistic CGI models that never pan out....The models they have brought to car shows are more or less exactly what they’ll be delivering. They didn’t try to hype up stuff they may not be able to deliver on. They actually purposefully tried to do everything completely behind the scenes as much as possible until they actually had a physical product to show off. Their skate board chassis will be used by many other brands besides Ford IMO.  Their partnerships are quite impressive this early in. Amazon already ordered 100,000 delivery vans.

505,AI," The fact that they are running a beta program on hundreds of thousands of vehicles automatically means they are by far the most likely to achieve the government safety rating for autonomous vehicles first. That combined with their prestigious brand means they will absolutely be THE major player when autonomous cars start to take over the road. This puts them light years ahead of almost all their competition and is the original reason why they blew up last year. But in my opinion, the single most valuable thing that Tesla has, is their current Beta program which will amass an unbelievable amount of data which is needed to perfect the AI. I believe we are in a Tech bubble and I do think EV companies are for the most part vastly overvalued, but Tesla is not primarily an EV company in the way that the other companies listed in your post are. They are also a software company that will mostly likely get fully autonomous AI certified on the road first, and robo-taxis and self driving delivery trucks are only a small part of the buying frenzy that will be unleashed when they have certified self-driving consumer priced cars on the road.

That being said, I have no idea if that justifies their current stock price or if they could get some serious competition from other AI research (don't sleep on Google, the original company that had a head start in R&D). Telsa is undoubted overpriced and will fall if the tech bubble finally pops, but that will not stop them from dominating the huge market that will open up in the next few years and their stock will sky-rocket from there. The other sketchy EV companies you have listed will fall harder when interest rates are increased and are NOT competitors to Tesla in any meaningful way.

525,RKT," If you're short it's a turd. Nothing wrong with RKT, it's just easy to manipulate. I set up a small long term strangle at this level. I'll likely add every month. Most shorts in housing right now are betting on a market crash like 2008. But the problem with that idea isn't the data that supports it, it's the government that is supporting main street mortage holders. They will have to for years to come, but that will be better than a slow 12 year recovery like the last time.

But let's look at the positives that we know, first time homebuyers have been on the sidelines for years and are taking out loans now. Supply is short so builders are working like crazy now making up for demand. The supply side of the market is still projected to be 10 years out, not accounting for new generations. These all create fine jobs. 

RKT is going to be aggressive in changing the industry towards modern tech and timelines. Mac and Mae are still accounting for risk in the market and stopping risky investments on their portfolios from multiple property owners, one of the causes of the 2008 crash was investment property risk. Boomers will be downsizing their properties for the final stages of retirement. Projections say they are 40% of the market. 

While this catching up to the levels of 2008 was crazy fast, a year, no one is looking forward to a repeat. There is massive incentive to keep prices at this level. 

Downsides. Funding of property down payments with portfolios last year was alarming. 
Investment properties in high cost cities got higher HuD funding, double edged sword, this might be speculative for micro bubbles as exodus from the cities from work from home companies is increasing. 
The average price of a home increased at such a level that securing a down payment became out of reach for more and more people. Government has not kept track with this hidden inflation. As such lenders did not assume risk and passed it on to consumers by raising credit score limits. Tightening the noose on the pool of borrowers even further. This in turn canceled out the pool available for first time home buyer grants such as discussed by the $15,000 credit, or even the current $12,000 credit, or getting 2 mortages, 1 @20% for down, 1 for 80%. 

Mortage rates rising. Neutral positon. The market needs to calm down in order for supply to catch up with demand. If boomers decide to dump 50% their properties and retire, great. Those houses will be snapped up at these rates. 

Our biggest problem with the market is simply the majority of houses are old, fucking 70's old on average. Flipping houses is great, but most people don't address anything other than cosmetic fixes. Supply needs to demo and rebuild modern housing in most markets. Like the 50's, 80's, and 00's did. This would offer some realistic benefit to the entire infrastructure, as electrical, energy savings, and mechanical systems could increase value while decreasing usage. The more modular a system, the better for cost. Imagine if HUD, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac were part of the carbon offset buisness as well. And as a home owners you get a cut. 

Our second biggest problem is that wages have not kept up with productivity. If we were to see wages jump 10% and catch up with the 1990's, lol. Wages should always be tied to productivity. Accurate compensation is by far the biggest thing controlling supply and demand in the housing market. If the majority of wage earners could simply build a house with a few years of saving, the market would blow the fuck up. My family has never taken out loans, but has always owned land and houses, why? We build out of pocket. I haven't wanted to build another house for the housing market until this year. Global wages are just as bad.

Third problem. Giant banks need to get out of mortages, and by all data points they seem to be. RKT, UWM, both of them have come to a point in their business that they need to keep the pressure on supply of mortages so demand increases. They need to work on positive government regulation for generation inclusion in the markets for years. They should call Disney

With the moratorium on foreclosures releasing  massive supply of housing inventory on the market, will that also be a catalyst to surging mortgage applications and servicing?

Usually a block trade of this size would be done through a blockhouse who would use a network of brokers to execute “iceberg orders” to avoid share price volatility. This to me seems like they weren’t sold in the open market but rather through a pre-established agreement with one, single institution, or it would’ve been broken up into separate sales.

Interesting. Who is buying 45 million shares of AMC at this price? Perhaps someone with significant short exposure? Or, more interestingly, someone who’s about to acquire it. Or could just be a broker who is confident the can offload it given the volume and volatility and got paid a solid fee for execution.

My issue with AMC right now is that it’s legit trading above pre-pandemic levels with more shares outstanding now than there were then. So market cap is well above what people thought it was worth before covid and now the business 1) barely has revenue and 2) will likely see a paradigm shift of movie viewing habits even after the pandemic.

Not only are people not as interested to experience the movie in their home but they wait for the price to drop to $4 or $5. Mulan, Dumbo and many other movies all lost over 100 million dollars in a time people were most exposed to the option of purchasing them. The studios need theatres and this is proof more than ever and AMC likely has renegotiated contracts so that they get enough from the door to be profitable. They have been getting screwed for years losing millions of dollars as Hollywood studios were making billions off them.

810,PM," Yeah...except...most of the sellers on Poshmark kinda hate Poshmark. I mean I kinda hate it but I don’t leave so maybe you are onto something here. 

Their customer support is about as good as robinhood’s, and Poshmark heavily favors the buyers in dispute cases and lets buyers return things against their own TOS (pants didn’t fit oh and by the way I ripped the zipper trying to force them on, here’s your ruined pants back) just to keep buyers happy and drives a lot of sellers away for that. 

Also Poshmark loses a ton of “off platform” sales where sellers cross list their items on PM/mercari/eBay and when they find a buyer on PM they say “hey I have this for sale cheaper on this other site bc Poshmark will take 20%” and the sale actually happens on another site

Not to mention PM has increased shipping prices 2x in the last year from around $5 to almost $8 per item which really turns a lot of buyers off. Sellers end up paying half or all of the shipping for the buyers just to close the sale on top of PM’s 20% cut and that turns off the sellers so it’s a no win

I could rant about a lot more

Full disclosure I am a pretty successful PM seller and have made a lot of money doing it, I just don’t see any real value growth in the company until they fix some core issues",poshernextdoor,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9i5q6/dd_and_analysis_on_poshmark_posh_why_i_think_it/grpse4w/,0.091,0.749,0.16,0.973
811,TV," They advertise on TV where I live. I find the ads funny - they target buyers, saying the buyers supposedly get good deals on high-fashion items. And they target  sellers by making it sound like they are making money when in fact they are getting maybe half of what they paid for something 6 months ago when they bought it new.  ""I'm taking a trip to Fiji by clearing out unwanted items in my closet!"" 

I have some co-workers that in the Before Times had new clothes every week seemingly. I wonder if they are buying used on Poshmark and flipping them after a short time for a small loss.

Tesla is worth more than Ford, Honda, BMW, GM, Daimler, VW and Toyota combined.

In 2017 these companies together produced 44,382,808 cars. Tesla produced 101,312 cars.

Now these are not the newest numbers. But surely you see what I mean? The share price of Tesla clearly does not represent their production of cars.

To get a comparable profit out of their production, Tesla would need to sell their cars for 438 times as much than all the other companies :D

881,BMI," Let me add a little context for Square as a small business owner.

Square caters to smaller retailers. Their included software is extremely easy to customize for the  small businesses who want to run everything through a single terminal.

As an owner of a small regional Cafe chain, I need to run payroll, Merchant services,run inventory reports, quarterly reports, keep track of sales and trends, manage recipes and HACCP, play music for ambiance etc... Square has optional premium tools for more specialized needs but most of my needs were met by the included free options. The whole deal being paid for by a slightly larger payment processing fee ( slightly but also more clear and a better value for low average sales like in cafes and QSR) 

Currently, in order to stay in compliance with music licensing, I need a paid  music service that is commercial free and passes licensing fees on to the rights holders for playing music in a public venue. I could play from my own collection and deal with paying BMI or SCAP the $400 to $2000 per year fee and provide a written record of what had rotation. I could also pay for Pandora Pro, licensed through DMX digital ( my current system ) but this is another piece of hardware and a really crappy UI for $40 a month.

Tidal will offer a number of opportunities for integration right through the Square system. I am currently able to run 70% of my core services through my Square terminal. Our uptime is roughly 99%, so pretty good considering how many tasks were once managed through a dozen separate sign ins with wildly different UI configurations. The amount of time I spend dealing with all of these management tasks has dropped by roughly 25% since integrating into the Square ecosystem. Training staff to use Square is literally 30 minutes and the occasional yell across the cafe for questions and answers 

Now, there are absolutely still a fair number of irritating issues with Square. That said, it was bordering on inducing murderous rage before integrating into Square. Last year, my business partner decided to try a competing product. His management workload increased by about 15% after set up and getting up to speed ( 3 days ) and his cost of services increased by about 10%. he switched back after a few months and bought stock in Square.

Through the 9 years we have used Square in our businesses, we have had 3 customer support tickets opened. Only one was a huge pain in the ass and it was due to a faulty cable on a 5 year old iPad stand.

We have used Square capital as a tool for growth. It is a pretty expensive borrow cost but the ease of use and the instant access to funds made it useful.
