2,APHA," Thanks for your post.  Question about initial investments.  You say you take 20% of your profit for 20% of growth, but what does your initial investment strategy look like?  For example, I've been building a position in APHA for a couple years now.  I started investing at $6 and have continued to buy shares every month or so for \~24 months now.  I don't have large sums of cash, so I continually invest in a handful of companies over time.  Are you making large initial investments then not re-investing in the same companies?  I guess my question is, why is it better to take profits on the way up rather than holding and compounding your gains via time in market?  Just an inexperienced investor here that is truly curious.  Let's forget about GME. I'd rather never hear about that stock again.  I had to unsubscribe from r/wallstreetbets cause that community is such a boring echo chamber now.",president_zug,31,/r/investing/comments/ldrsgq/a_story_about_the_dot_com_bubble_some_profit/gm7nunc/,0.031,0.794,0.175,0.9738

4,AAPL," This is trading and not investing. 

If you're selling your winners into rallies then you're only going to be left with losers. And you even said you sold GME when it dropped lower which isn't one of your rules.

GME was a freak bubble. You'd be smart to sell into the move higher and cash out totally when you're satisfied. But the lessons from that are not applicable to most other stocks. 

What if you sold into NVDA, AAPL, or any other stock that's done better than 10x? You'd have taken a great position and auctioned most of it of before its true potential was realized. And then what do you do? You put PayPal which has already doubled over the past year. So by your logic your just buying the position that someone else is profit taking on. That's just moving taxed realized gains into a new position that carries a comparable amount of risk.

When I invest, I make a thesis. I let the 10Q's and product performance guide my decisions. Mania and hysteria will arise in just about any well known stock. If a 20% move spurs a reaction from you then you're never going to be able to hold for an absolutely giant move... up or down. You're just a trader playing with his food.",SoFloSpearo,25,/r/investing/comments/ldrsgq/a_story_about_the_dot_com_bubble_some_profit/gm87bkn/,0.058,0.822,0.12,0.929

9,GME," I bought and sold GME multiple times during the rocket ride. I sold half on a double. It kept going up so I bought back in. At one point, when RH first restricted trading, I was down $25,000.

When I’d started dropping, I sold at about a 75% gain. I lost money on my final trade in the $200s, but overall I made $27,000 in about a week.

11,GME," What do you do with your ""tax"" money? Do you set that money aside or do you keep all of your money together and just worry about it come April?

Example: I too made some money on GME. I calculated the estimated short term taxes, put it in a 2nd account and invested in safe/ETFs/blue chip stocks. Come next April, I'll have 5-15% (hopefully more) profit, sell for long term gain.

14,MSFT," I’ve been trying to come up with a clear and concise plan such as this. I am, first and foremost, here to make some fucking money. I want to keep that front and center, and not lose sight of it. 

I did get wrapped up in the GameStop thing. It was my first trade ever. Although I had been watching the markets for years, I just hadn’t been set up life-wise until this year. So... I hear about RC, see the deal with MSFT, and think: “this company will turn around. I can get in now and make some profit.” Then? Well, we all know what happened. I didn’t have a damn clue about what a short squeeze was, how to capitalize on it, or what options even were, let alone how to trade them. I learned so. fucking. much. those first few weeks. When the first gamma squeeze happened? I set stop losses in a tiered system like you describe in your method. I made my initial investment back, and then took 6x my initial investment in profits. I have no regrets. Yeah, I could’ve made more, and yeah, I think about it, but don’t let it delegate my attitude or other investments. NO WAY. That’s how you get burned. 

I still trade, but don’t really want to fuck with meme stocks for awhile. I rolled the GameStop money over into other things, and I’m building exit strategies with real-world achievable goals. I also have a large end-game goal to trading in general, and I think it’s important to have that. It will make me more disciplined in my executions, and not allow me to get lost in the intricacies of each little trade I make.

16,BABA," I started my first investment portfolio with $2,000 in the late 90's because everyone was making money in internet stocks.  I was super impatient.  I'd buy a stock, if it didn't go up significantly in a month or two, I'd give up on it and buy something else.  I managed to move my $2,000 portfolio to a $30 (yes, literally thirty dollars) portfolio.  It was essentially the cost of admission and I learned a few things.  So I'll add my lessons to this post as well:

* Just invest mostly in mutual funds (or, these days, ETFs if you prefer, but I don't).  Do you really think you're going to do better at picking stocks than someone who has been doing that as their full time job for the past 20 years?

* You can still buy some stocks ""for fun"" if you really like them, but buy real companies.  Don't fuck around with penny stocks, meme stocks or the next big thing.  I've got a few individual stocks that I hold and make up about 15% of my portfolio now.  There's a few small ones, but the bulk of it is made up of MSFT that I own at $38.50, FB that I own at $38.00 and BABA that I own at $92.00.  I also just bought DIS at $170 (owned it at $17.06 years ago and should have held on to it).

* **Don't even have a margin account**.  Margin is just a way to fuck yourself when the market turns around - especially in the current market.  There's no reason to borrow money to buy stocks.  If you're borrowing money on margin, you likely already have other debts - like a mortgage.  Your investment money could be used to pay down that instead of investing, so consider that your margin loan.

* Never, never, never make and investment that you don't understand.  I don't mean buying stock of a company that you don't understand (although that's a bad idea too).  I mean buying some option ladder that you have no idea what happens to the value of your investment when the underlying stock price goes up by 10% or down by 10% - or by 50%, or 100%.

* NEVER!  NEVER!  NEVER! make an investment with an unlimited loss potential.  Melvin Capital and GME should be enough to convince you of that.  But people also fuck themselves over by selling uncovered calls and shit like that - typically because they don't understand the investment they're making.

* Don't make things more complicated than necessary.  My portfolio is fairly substantial now, and other than those few individual stocks, it's in 7 mutual funds.  That's it.  Large, Mid, Small, International, Conservative, and S&P index and an Asian fund because I'm bullish on Asia.  I rebalance it and check to make sure my mutual funds are still performing well about once every 3-5 years or if there is a significant market change.

only investing in cheap index funds till 50k

13k so far.

I bought a few stocks, PLTR,  Siemens, Coca-Cola n pfizer.  

just to dabble, is there a good way to buy and sell stocks without getting screwed by fees at such low volumes.  ie £400/500 per trade.   the in and out fee is like 30quid.   that's alot of 8%s to make up

22,GME," I was in my 20s and we were day trading 10k in momentum stocks like KTEL to make a few hundred bucks a day.  It was very similar to GME, a dying business model that promised to reinvigorate itself through the internet.

26,GME," This is good advice. I’ve been investing 80% conservatively, 20% speculatively for a year only.

My 20% in august went into GME options so now I have a whole new account. I’m reallocating but basically trying to do exactly as you advised. Have some sitting in cash, most conservatively invested - and a fresh 20% of the new total ready to throw at the crazy market again.

27,GME," I'm going to have to read and re-read this.

A few weeks back, I thought I was being way too cautious, way too conservative when I sold my GME and reinvested half. I turned 30k into 60k, was really happy, and tried to predict a dip and buy in at a presumably lower price. It was a ham-fisted approach, but I'm only a year into active investing.

Well, Elon Fucking Musk tweeted and the price skyrocketed. I decided to only invest half of the 60k capital. As the price mooned again, I was still frustrated, calculating what I would have made if I left my capital in to begin with.

Well, here I sit with all those profits nearly wiped out. What is now a 8k gain on 30k could have been a 20k or so loss.

I want to get into more passive trading strategies, and I will utilize these lessons you learned.",prometheus2508,1,/r/investing/comments/ldrsgq/a_story_about_the_dot_com_bubble_some_profit/gm8zjop/,0.071,0.777,0.152,0.9172

29,AAPL," Also holding = no tax event, especially if it's the difference between short term vs capital gains. 

If anything, one should not actively manage their (low-medium risk) positions so much unless there's a specific and concrete reason for a grand strategic change. Otherwise let the profit run. You should scale up instead of down - if AMZN has grown very large on its own, put your new salary into other things to balance the ratio or invest in other industries, while still maintaining some cash on hand. 

The ratio won't be stable like a fund doing this, but I find it working out way better. Winner has tend to win more a lot in recent times. Also, the trouble of tax events are not worth the ""potential"" extra 5% I can earn from pulling moves to me - which aren't even guaranteed between bad decisions and potential extra tax.  

Everything I've hold so far is over 2-3 years long: 

Top performers include: TSLA, SHOP, SQ, NVDA, AMZN, AAPL, Crypto, etc. 

Meh performers include: FB, GOOGL, DIS, TTWO, etc.

Shittiest performance is index SPY. 

If I had scaled any back the way OP described as things popped off of a ER or special trigger, my performance would be significantly worse especially one before they have become capital gains. I've held TSLA since $50 (or $250 pre-split) without selling any until $694.20. 

My newer holds (less than 1 year) are ETSY, LSPD, API, all of which boomed too but I ain't gonna scale shit back either. Why would I if I still believe in the business and the growth of it? 

The only take away from this post is don't catch the falling knife with debt that you can't sustain. Keep cash on hand (which I have plenty) and hold through dips or crashes. Same things applies to the dot com bubble too.

44,GME," I see this sentiment a lot and it's not helped by all the people who are dumping on you now for being greedy and not selling.  If you sold at $320 and it went to $2000 you'd be opining about how you paper handed and lost out on profits.  The fact of the matter is that the ""short thesis"" for GME which was once a long shot proved to be correct.  What fucked up many people's decision making was the uncertainty of whether the price collapse (1/28 - 2/1) was due to market manipulation or if the bubble had burst.  

The truth is no one fucking knew what was going to happen and the ""I told you so"" people are completely full of shit.  If you leaned more conservative AND took your money out at the top you're now a genius (survivor bias).  But if the short squeeze was allowed to happen and you were in 6 figures the tables would be flipped.  Don't be dejected for making the wrong decision in a completely FUBAR scenario.  How much money you make in the market is always going to be a combination of informed decision making, risk, and luck.  Just learn all you can from this situation to help you make better ones next time, but make sure you're learning the right ones.

57,GME," I’ve told my dot com crash story a lot this week. In 1999, as a young investor I hit it big with Cisco  only to see it all crash away.  It didn’t happen overnight, so I watched it day after day thinking “it’s Cisco, it’ll come back!  I’m sure others were buying even more shares “on the dip”.  It’s a famous example of a stock that didn’t recover for 14 years. 

Twenty years later it still stings, kind of like a bad breakup. Hindsight, it’s so clear I should have sold after it exploded. But euphoria and FOMO are powerful. It’s human nature. 

But I just kept at it, putting money in every month, year after year and while I never had another Cisco, I had Tesla and Shopify and others that did me well. 

Look forward, not back. You can still earn money and invest money and there’s many growth sectors right now to invest in. It’ll work out. 

Based on what I’ve learned, had I been in your situation with GME I’d have sold half.  If you totally jump ship too early you can miss out on gains (See my Tesla example). Splitting the difference is my acknowledgment that I can’t time the market or a stock perfectly.

I sold some later that year when it tripled to $20, and more at $80. I sold again at $200, and $400, and $695, and $880. 

If I had just let it all ride I would have made about 4x more profit. Do I regret not just holding in a company I believed in? A piece of me does, but overall? No way.

I look on my trading platform and I can buy for $100.1 a share and sell for $99.9 a share. (The bid ask spread is 0.1% either way). This is completely normal for a highly traded (high volume) stock.

You look on RH or something like that and you can buy the stock for $100.8 and sell for $99.2 or something. These are hypothetical numbers but let’s say the difference is $0.7 a share. You buy 10 shares, it’s effectively a transaction fee of $7.... but it’s free right? They get their fee just in a different guise 

So in short for the TLDR: they do profit off of the bid:ask spread. Along with the MMs.

I think the Dutch company DSM (DSM.AS) is one of the biggest players in that field.

110,UK," Hi, I do trade some seaweed in the UK, it’s use is typically in Petfood here, I have heard about methane studies into agriculture but unsure of their results. 
The companies processing seaweed are typically small and not on any stock market, harvesting seaweed on just a few boat fleet, drying then packing.
I think seaweed has many benefits.
Garlic is also used to reduce methane in cows.

111,CP," I researched into seaweed as well a little while back. The applications are many indeed - bio fuels, bio fertilizers, cosmetics, medicine, thickening agent and even a low calorie ice cream.

So aside from being a major foodstamp in the east, and a growing source of nutrients in the west, the use as carbon sink is also promising.

If you're interested in the seaweed market I'd advise you to read [The guide to the Seaweed Industry](http://www.fao.org/3/y4765e/y4765e00.htm), published by the Food and Agriculture Orgqnization. It's pretty thorough and gives plenty of insights into the subject matter.

That being said, and as a lot of people already pointed out, it's difficult to find publicly traded companies that specialize in the processing of seaweed directly. Among the companies I did find, the most interesting one was a French company called Algaia, which specializes in Algae-based food and personal care products, but it's also privately owned.

There are also CP Kelco and Acadian Seaplants in the US, Algea and Seaweed Energy Solutions in Norway, and Seasol in Australia. On the other hand, The Chinese market is overly saturated in seaweed companies.

So as with any commodity, it's a bet on a trend that might never catch on, but as long as you know and understand your risk profile, I think it's a calculated risk worth taking, given the right opportunity.",zindex9999,12,/r/investing/comments/ldpnmo/investing_opportunities_in_seaweed/gm7p3c1/,0.037,0.843,0.12,0.9348
112,CBD," It seems like companies aren't just algae farming (like raw supplier), they're biofuel and food and supplement companies with their own farm. https://www.biotech-careers.org/company-core-activity/algae https://www.algaeu.com/list-of-algae-companies.html

Someone posted about solarvest, which is a biotech/pharma research company that acquired other companies and are doing patents on certain extraction of algae (omega-3, biofuel, animal nutrition, CBD, etc) This company went from .09c to .25c within a couple months already. 10m cap, do not see any info about them making revenue. 377k cash, and 3.31m debt. Sounds like you're paying for the research. Solarvest seems really cool on paper, ""we are working on doing this and this to make the world a better place"" kind of deal, A part of me already got sold and want to invest, but shark tank is teaching me to critically think how is the company going to profit.

I think the profit margin growing algae aren't high, the idea might be investing in companies who are able to process the algae into a product as an alternative ""greener""/healthier choice.

Also there's zero chance that they would buy a commercial to announce the merger. That is a ridiculous suggestion.

154,GME," I've been investing for a lot of years. I have won some and I have lost some on taking some small gambles. But on those gambles people should only put in money that they can afford to lose. I feel bad in a sense for the people who put in their life savings, took out loans and put in huge amounts of money, etc etc into GME and lost big time. It's still there fault as we are all accountable for our own actions and decisions. I guess I just empathize on their loss and lack of knowledge of the stock market and was taken advantage of in a pump and dump hype frenzy brought on by social media and the news media in the hopes of getting rich. Funny what money can do to a person.....

I also decided to take a small gamble on GME figuring I would probably lose, but maybe in the off chance I would get lucky and make a little bit of money, also figured I was too late to the party as well. But I put in a stop loss order when I bought, so I lost very little money on it. Now that people have lost a lot of money they are becoming irrational in their thinking, posting a lot of conspiracy theories, posting a lot of threads on Reddit and clinging onto what little hope is left, so Reddit has become very cringe lately with all the posts on the meme stocks, but I suppose it's their way of coping for now. Until they have come to the realization they lost.

My advice for them is to take this loss, accept it and use as motivation to learn from this mistake and to learn more about the stock market and make smarter investments within it.

157,GME," All I know about this GME fiasco is that squeeze or no squeeze, Reddit contagious enthousiasm + media attention and cute story created an exponential buying force until party was over.

So, in other words, at best it's a failed squeeze so far.  More realistically, a textbook pump and dump, even if involuntary.

The important thing right now is to reevaluate our thought process day after day and learn from that.",sacdecorsair,13,/r/investing/comments/ldzb68/gme_mob_mentality_and_the_irresponsibility_of/gm9a6gf/,0.163,0.675,0.162,-0.0258
158,GME," I think one of the biggest takeaways from this situation, and one of the least discussed, is how it revealed how little financial education many people had. The amount of people invested for the first time in something that was so obviously a gambit and, lacking competence, relying on the advice of other people who had no investment experience led to a blind leading the blind situation, conspiracy theories and acting on pure faith over a plan that never truly actually existed.

Insofar as media has clumped retail investors together as some sort of cohesive actor inside the market, and people are clamoring for 'the next move', I think the 'next move' should be that we accept that we have a responsibility to one another as global citizens to help people have access to good, trustworthy, reliable financial education resources so they know who to listen to when mobs of frenzied teens who've never set foot in a poker room tell them to go all in with a pair of nines. Not debating the merits of a gamble, but don't walk into the high stokes poker room at the Bellagio if you don't know how to play poker.

The real 'play' of retail investors should be giving people a basic groundwork of the markets, so they're not pulled into hyped up trades unequipped with basic knowledge like when the markets open, what options are, etc., and can identify the difference between what is actual due diligence and what is nonsensical conspiracy and narrative. I think this goes for critical thinking skills to identify propaganda in media (whether that's corporate media, or citizen media, whether it's on TVs or on social media), but relevant to investing itself, I think it's bordering on criminal that personal finance is not in our school curriculums and one of the things the GME saga exposed is the danger of that reality.

I am not the most experienced or smartest investor in the world, but it's for the reasons I outlined above that I've been trying to answer new investors' basic questions in detail for the last few days. I hope the other people can feel the same sense of commitment because the lack of competence, as this event has shown, leads to disastrous and sometimes irreversible outcomes in the real world. I've already read about one suicide related to this.

I also felt I had ""nothing to lose"" going for the grand slam. For some perspective I bought GME at 17.20 and quickly found myself 80k up on the trade. My psychology at the time was it's still not enough followed by even if it does go down I'll still be massively on top. 

Well reality eventually caught up at I ended up selling at 20k instead of 80k and you know what I'm ok with that. I made decisions based on the information I had and I felt overall they were good, the mistake isn't having sold so low but rather topping up 11 more shares @220.

Sure it was bad for ppl like me who had sell orders set at $500 or more (I still made great money tho), but bubbles pop fast and at the end of the day it's a prisoner's dilemma problem. Nobody can predict how high a squeeze will go, and getting your sell order filled is a question of being slightly faster/ 
less greedy than the next guy. Those suckers setting their limit orders to $1k or $1420.69 or $5k were always gonna be left holding the bag. If your $20 stock is sitting at $450 and you're relying on the next retail RH user to come along bid the price up to $600 then you're no longer in a short squeeze play, you're in a pump and dump.

Agree about the ""short bubble"", fwiw. It's frustrating that it doesn't get talked about. But the retail bubble was real too, and it's not like everyone gets rich in a short squeeze. The stock was never gonna stay at $400 for long, and it was always gonna crash hard. RH might have made it happen a little earlier but they didn't cause it.

Maybe it is, maybe it's not.  That just isn't of interest to me.

The point is to learn from the fact that Reddit got in such a frenzy that the overall mainstream rhetoric here didn't even acknowledge the basic truth of a short squeeze - that it absolutely will come back down and fast.

>Institutions pulled out because buying was restricted. Obviously the price is going to go down when buying is restricted and selling is allowed to go on. Right? 

Wrong.  Retail buys at that point were not a part of the equation.  I already told you that it's painfully easy to see this by looking at citadel's reported figures and looking at volume.  Institutions pulled out because that's what you do in a short run momentum trade.  You exit after a pop.  White knuckling it after a 300% gain isn't something professional money does, so let's just dispel that bit of nonsense here.

>DUH! Had buying not been restricted, the institutions would have stayed in because there was a lot more money to be made, and the retail trader (no matter how many of them there were) would have benefited too.

This is a pure fantasy.  One that rests not only on a poor understanding of market dynamics and short squeeze history, but one that deliberately ignores the actual order volume and flows.  

By the way, retail trades were net sells after the 25th.  See [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop)

 >Many of the big retail brokerages, including Robinhood, route a lot of their customer orders to Citadel Securities, so it ends up seeing a large percentage of retail trades in U.S. stocks. It can see if retail traders are mostly buying or mostly selling or mostly pretty balanced. You might expect—I certainly expected—to see that retail traders were buying more than they were selling this week. The stock seemed to be rocketing up on frenzied retail sentiment, and the posters on WallStreetBets were all claiming that they would never sell and keep buying until it hit $1,000.

>But here’s what Citadel Securities’ retail flow looked like in GameStop this week: 1

>You could tell a related story like: “Retail investors on Reddit started the rally to squeeze professional short sellers, and then this week the professional short sellers capitulated and started buying the stock at even higher prices from those redditors, who claimed victory and took profits.” This is probably true, at least in part. It also matches the popular story reasonably well, except that in the popular story the short squeeze is in the future, and the Reddit traders are supposed to be holding firm so that short sellers can’t cover even at recent high prices.

>Another reading would be: “Lots of retail investors are piling into this stock, and the price action is coming from them, but they’re mostly buying stock from other retail investors.” 3  Those other retail investors could be normal people who bought 100 shares of GameStop in 2005, forgot about them, and then remembered and sold them into this rally, or they could be Reddit posters who got in early, pumped the stock on WallStreetBets, and then happily got out as more people piled in to buy.


>I don’t want to make too much of this. There are always as many buyers as sellers, so it’s not really a surprise that about half of the retail investors playing the GameStop game were buying and about half, or a little more, were selling. GameStop has about 69.7 million shares outstanding, but almost 180 million shares traded on both Monday and Tuesday, meaning that on average each GameStop share turned over 2.5 times on each of those days. Of course people were buying and selling and selling and buying; the fact that the retail crowd was not overwhelmingly on one side is pretty much a mathematical requirement.

>Still I think this complicates the popular story of “everyone on Robinhood was buying GameStock at once, and none of them were selling, so the stock went up in a demonstration of the power of small-time traders to take on Wall Street.” Retail investors were both buying and selling, and selling a bit more than they were buying, as the stock was rocketing and (some!) hedge funds were losing their shirts.

>This also, incidentally, helps clear up one of the biggest mysteries, for me, in modern equity market structure. We talk a lot around here about “payment for order flow,” the system by which Citadel Securities (and other wholesalers) pays Robinhood (and other retail brokers) to trade with its customers’ orders. I like to tell a fairly textbook version of that story. Market makers stand ready to buy or sell stock from or to customers; they try to buy for a bit less than they sell at, and pocket the spread. If you go out into the market and say “hey I’ll buy anyone’s stock for $10,” and a really smart hedge fund comes to you and sells you stock for $10, that’s probably bad. You’ve probably made a mistake. The hedge fund is selling you the stock for $10 because it knows it’s worth $8. This is called “adverse selection.”



I want to be clear here, despite your attempts to convey expertise you have made posts that rest on a deliberate disagreement with known facts.  This is not a matter of interpretation, you may think we're two people spitballing answers, but I am not.  I am telling you that the basic observable facts of the last two weeks - volume, known entities on the long side of the trade, order flows, etc all contradict the theory you are attempting to build.

GameStop has about 69.7 million shares outstanding, but almost 180 million shares traded on both Monday and Tuesday, meaning that on average each GameStop share turned over 2.5 times on each of those days. Of course people were buying and selling and selling and buying; the fact that the retail crowd was not overwhelmingly on one side is pretty much a mathematical requirement.

>Still I think this complicates the popular story of “everyone on Robinhood was buying GameStock at once, and none of them were selling, so the stock went up in a demonstration of the power of small-time traders to take on Wall Street.” Retail investors were both buying and selling, and selling a bit more than they were buying, as the stock was rocketing and (some!) hedge funds were losing their shirts.

>This also, incidentally, helps clear up one of the biggest mysteries, for me, in modern equity market structure. We talk a lot around here about “payment for order flow,” the system by which Citadel Securities (and other wholesalers) pays Robinhood (and other retail brokers) to trade with its customers’ orders. I like to tell a fairly textbook version of that story. Market makers stand ready to buy or sell stock from or to customers; they try to buy for a bit less than they sell at, and pocket the spread. If you go out into the market and say “hey I’ll buy anyone’s stock for $10,” and a really smart hedge fund comes to you and sells you stock for $10, that’s probably bad. You’ve probably made a mistake. The hedge fund is selling you the stock for $10 because it knows it’s worth $8. This is called “adverse selection.”



I want to be clear here, despite your attempts to convey expertise you have made posts that rest on a deliberate disagreement with known facts.  This is not a matter of interpretation, you may think we're two people spitballing answers, but I am not.  I am telling you that the basic observable facts of the last two weeks - volume, known entities on the long side of the trade, order flows, etc all contradict the theory you are attempting to build.  


> Also- I’ve never used Robinhood. Sorry to thwart your attack on my intelligence.

Your entire short post history is filled with poorly informed conspiracy theories regarding Robinhood and GME.  I'm sure you won't listen to anything I say here, but perhaps you should spend more time learning about the market rather than attacking people who know more than you.  

I don't think I'll bother engaging further, I find it generally somewhat of a fool's errand to continue to argue with people who would rather feel right than learn.

Hello,

Full disclosure, I am very new at this, both posting and investing.

Wanted to bring a long term possibility to you to at least keep it maybe on your radar.

$SENS - Senseonics Holdings Inc. $2.67/share range

The manufacture/R&D an implantable CGM(Constant Glucose Meter) for Diabetics. They are the only implantable CGM on the market.

There are other similar out there. $DXCM ( Dexcom), MDT ( Medtronic PLC), and ABT(Abbott Labs Libre CGM)

Right now SENS has a 3 month implant here in the USA, they are done there testing and have submitted to the FDA for the 6 month implant for approval. The 6 month implant has been approved and being used in the EU.

Once the 6 month gets approval here, it should grow rapidly.

They are also continuing R&D on a 1yr implant.

My son is a user of the 3 month implant, he was one of the younger ones implanted within the first 6months of it being approved here. He had tried the Dexcom and the Medtronics CGMs and once he used the SENS CGM he has not turned back.

I believe in this product, it has changed my 18yr old son's life for the better. I will hold the shares that I have, and purchase more when I have the funds to do it.

This is not a short term buy/sell make money stock, for me this is a buy when I have a couple of bucks, buy again, buy again and hold, and give to my son as his inheritance when I pass 40 years from now kind of stock.

When my son was using Dex, scar tissue built up at the sensor site, and he would have to move the next insertion point.

When my son was using Medtronics, he hated it. The needle was a little bit longer and thicker and it caused him pain on every insertion. 9months of using and only about 4month of numbers because of PITA of using it.

SENS sensor, is a one time/3months insertion in the upper arm.

The 6month unit has been active in the EU for over a year I think? and still going strong.

They minimized their US operations because I think they came here too soon before the 6month unit was approved and I agree, the 3month is a little bit PITA, but for my son it has been life changing.

252,BEAM," I would also look into Precision bioscience (ticker DTIL). It is still underappreciated respect to other peers. They use their proprietary ARCUS platform which uses smaller nuclease (few hundreds amino acids).  Smaller molecules are easier to deliver and they generally have a better safety profile because they have a lower incidence of off-target DNA editing.

&#x200B;

what I like is that they are not only a pure gene editing company but they also have an immunotherapy program that targets CD19, CD20 and BCMA. So their pipeline is broad and should be able to better absorb a failure.

They have about $100M in cash and they burn around $80M a year from what I read. I think they are going to have dilute down the road and raise some cash but if they dilute at 20+ the hit might not be too big.

Valuation stands at around $850M versus $13B for CRSPR,  $4.5B for NTLA, $6.8B for BEAM.  This is not to say this is better than beam but given the lower valuation might run more than the other 3 companies simply because its valuation is <$1B.

284,ACH," Hello. I'm going to give my background info as requested in the OP before asking specific questions, I tend to ramble so apologies in advance. tl;dr 24y/o american with stable but not incredibly paying job and future prospects looking to take advantage of his extremely low mid-term living expenses (thus high savings prospects) to add some risk to the highly recommended relatively low risk broad ETF strategy that's generally advocated here. Even my tl;dr rambled.

>Assets and income: ~$20,000 in cash savings, $1300 off of a stock I bought as a teen as a joke, Merrill 401k with $1000 in it so far that I'm maxing the match for and have set at a high risk option, ~$40k yearly from work, $1000 old car, about $1800/m in cash savings at current rate (last 5 months since my current pay rate). I guess I also have a record collection discogs tells me is worth $3000 but fuck me if I'm selling that. And a liberal arts degree, if that counts at all lmfao.

>>How this might change: My career offers advancement opportunities, but not many in the specific department I'm in now. Even if I get to another department, I'd be surprised if I ever hit 6 figure salary. I expect to spend like $3-6k of my savings on a new car in the next 6 months, not including whatever I can get for my current one (it needs repairs). My 401k is also moving to John Hancock I guess. Not much else changing soon here.

//

>Debts, expenses: No debts at all, no major regular expenses because I'm living with my parents and paying extremely reasonable rent. I pay for my car insurance, my phone, some streaming services, some hobbyist stuff, etc. Average of ALL spending in the same time frame as I've saved $1800/m in cash is about $900/m, which might not even include some stuff I returned now that I think about it. I even work from home so not even any gas expenses right now.

>>How this might change in the future: I don't expect to move out in the next 2-4 years. There's things keeping me home more than saving money. But if I start making more money I might pay more to my parents, seems only fair, but I don't know how likely a major raise is for me in that time period, and it would still be less than whatever I'd have to pay for market rent plus utilities and shit. I could probably reduce my spending even more with some discipline (don't ask how much of that $900/m has gone to vinyl records). The biggest one would be if concerts start happening again, no matter what I'm always going to spending a solid amount on concerts if they're happening, but I'm not irresponsible with it. 

//

>One more thing to mention: My family is comfortable enough that if I lose everything I won't be homeless. My immediate family isn't rich at all, but extended family offers very solid upper-middle-class level safety nets and even inheritances long term. Not that I plan to bankrupt myself or ever come close to that being possible, but it does up my risk tolerance somewhat.

//

>Overall Objective: Not have to look at $20,000 sit in savings making .02% interest. Ideally this would be as long term as possible, don't think I'll ever buy a house (maybe with inheritances in 10-20 years) so I'm mostly thinking about retirement or generally very long term. Disaster could mean dipping into it but like I said, I have a solid safety net. **That said, I would also like to throw in some higher risk stuff, or at least start to learn about it more so I can feel comfortable doing it in the future**. I feel very comfortable financially atm and have all this savings and I want to see what I can make it do with some risk.

>>How to reach the objective: My current plan is to take $5k of my savings and go the ETF route, splitting between large cap and growth/mid/small cap stuff, with a sprinkling of international and sector etfs (mostly thinking clean energy for sectors) and a tiny bit of crypto. Then put $100 every pay period back into all of that. I can adjust that amount as needed for my situation, it might go up fairly significantly short term while I still can't spend any money on concerts, if my emergency fund gets bloated again, it might also be supplemented by cash dumps. Lots depends on how soon the pandemic opens stuff up. **Ideally, this will be supplemented with higher-risk opportunities I can do more research on after hearing from you guys.**

>Financial Education: Very little, but eager & imo capable of learning a lot more. My job is customer service for a small bank so I do know a lot about personal banking, you know, I know what ACH means, but I don't know how much of that applies to investing. I'm willing to teach myself, though. I have no illusions of reading myself into an MBA online, but I am not above opening a textbook if necessary. In the last couple weeks since Gamestop piqued my interest in investing (I didn't put any money into any of that thank god), I've already learned a hell of a lot just looking up terms I see used on investopedia etc, a few related youtube channels that seemed cool, etc. I've enjoyed it, and can see myself really putting in a lot of effort on learning more with the right resources.

Questions (I am not asking for financial advice):

1. Broadly speaking, do you think I am stable/making enough to even be considering anything higher risk than standard ETFs? Is my rationale for having a somewhat high personal risk tolerance sound?
2. If so, what kind of higher risk investments would be appropriate for my financial situation and experience level? How much might I put into them?
3. Are there any types of higher risk investments that you think might be appropriate for my financial situation and risk tolerance, but not my experience level? If so, how can I educate myself to get to a point where it might be appropriate?
4. A little more specific here, I have been reading a lot on growth-oriented ETFs. They seem like they might be a decent middle ground with somewhat higher risk without requiring too much knowledge. Do you agree with this? Do you think I could go even riskier at my current level?
5. If you feel like you have a high level of financial education but didn't go to school for it (or know a lot about self-education resources), what do you recommend I read, in general? And specifically, for my situation?
6. Anything else you think I should know?

Country: UK

Profession: Solicitor

Savings (bank account): £80,000

Help to Buy ISA: £11,000

Pension: £29,000 (I do not plan to continue contributions until next year at the earliest as there no employers contributions where I work and I want to maximise savings for property investment)

Student debt (1.1% interest): £17,000

Income: was £110,000, now £37,000 (left my job to move to Vietnam), rising to £47,000 after one year (and should keep rising each year)

Risk appetite: medium to high


Objectives: 

- I don’t know how long I will stay in Vietnam, it depends how the job goes. It will be for at least 1-3 years. After this, I will move to another country or back to the UK, earnings will go up to £100,000+.

- I plan to save at least £1,200 a month for the next year, more in year 2, and pay the minimum contributions towards my student debt (£200 a month). 

- I am setting up a legal side hustle. If it works out I should earn between £250-£1,000 extra a month from this. This will all go towards savings.

- my plan in the next two years is to buy a rental property in Vietnam. I don’t wish to buy a house to live in (I’m not close to settling yet). The real estate market in Vietnam is growing quickly and I think a good investment for the future. My wife is Vietnamese so I can own land in Vietnam. This will cost around $100,000. If this works out well I will consider buying a second property with a mortgage and securing it against the first (security is required for a mortgage in Vietnam).


Questions:

- is my plan to buy property in Vietnam a fine idea? I will continue research for the next 1-2 years until I make the jump.

- What should I do with my savings? As I’m planning on using my savings to buy property in around 2 years, should I just keep this money in my bank account or invest it? I’ve been thinking about a low cost index fund like the FTSE 100 (which is down at the moment and apparently undervalued).",Goosebo,1,/r/investing/comments/lduce4/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gm7y9hp/,0.037,0.891,0.072,0.887

Learning about stocks is one thing but learning about those nuances while wrapped in with bankruptcy emergence is another.

312,USA," I'm looking for some anonymous strangers' views on my situation.  The short of it is that due to factors beyond my control, I'm having trouble managing my own portfolio, but I don't know what the right solution is.

About 2 years ago, I got half of a portfolio transferred to me that my grandparents started when I was a kid. Right now it's worth somewhere in the $200k range. 

Most of this portfolio is in individual stocks, and while they are more of the ""hold long term"" kinds of things,  I'm finding it overwhelming to keep track of it.  The hiccup is that the cost basis of most of these stocks is pretty low since they were bought a long time ago, and liquidating the portfolio would cost me somewhere around $25k in taxes, which also seems unappealing.  I get the other half of the portfolio in about 4 years.

Everything else in my life (at least financially) is okay. I'm in my mid 20s in the USA, I have a smaller portfolio (about $60k) of mostly ETFs, I max out my Roth, I have an emergency fund, no need for money for a house or school in the next few years, no debts, and I don't carry a credit card balance.

I'm curious what the crowd thinks is the sensible thing to do. I feel like I have 3 options, but maybe there's stuff I'm not considering?

1. I can learn to manage what I have
2. I can get the statements for the other half of the portfolio from my grandparents and just monkey-see-monkey-do copy whatever moves are being made there
3. I can sell the stocks off (either immediately or over time) and put the money into things I'm more comfortable managing myself",send-raccoon-pics,1,/r/investing/comments/lduce4/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gm8uuu2/,0.054,0.869,0.077,0.83

315,GME," I am new to investing, and know/understand very little, but I'd like to learn.

A foreward: I have spoken with my financial advisor who covers my lifetime investments. He handles mostly my IRAs and diversified portfolios, dealing mainly in mutual funds. He says their firm does not deal in stocks due to their volatility. I am investing in stocks with my own cash and do not use options or any form of loaned contract. He has helped me to understand some basics though, so I'm not totally in the weeds!

Okay! So people started buying GME and others because their shares were shorted. First of all, how do you purchase shares when they are over 100% shorted, wouldn't that be in the disinterest of the holding entities to sell at a higher price?

Second, what's stopping people from shorting GME and others when the prices started falling from their ATHs? Are they too expensive to short? It seems to me that if I could buy at $300 and sell at $70, if I could rent the shares for pennies on the dollar (I think that's how it works?) I'd make a killing in a short amount of time. So why not just liquidate the shorts at the higher price then re-short for massive gains that potentially 3-4x the initial loss?

Thanks :) hoping to learn some things. While I don't see myself investing in options or shorts in the near future, I feel it is important to be informed on how this all works.

I'm willing to be moderately risky in my approach.

I'm looking for advice on trying to profit from Smartmatics lawsuit against Fox News.

I've been following this in the news and I believe there may be an opportunity on the horizon to profit from shorting FOX.

However, I don't know enough about the stock market to be confident in my next steps or even if I should take the risk at all.

I understand shorting can be costly, particularly in situations like this where it will more likely than not turn into a protracted legal battle.

My question is do you view this as a legitimate opportunity, is it worth the risk? and if you believe it is, at what point would you consider opening your position, so interest doesn't kill your any potential profits.",NoCardiologist9759,0,/r/investing/comments/lduce4/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gm8qwuc/,0.068,0.718,0.214,0.9699

It will be very competitive leading up to and after legalisation and it will be hard to pick the companies that have staying power. There is obviously major potential, but good luck picking the winners.

My biggest bear case is that marijuana very easy to grow, it is literally a weed, so I actually feel it will be a greater boon to small, local operations and hobbyists, but its hard to say and depends on what the laws and taxes actually are when they are changed.

I could actually see big tobacco making the transition to weed and doing the best, but it's a very speculative market right now.

355,IEX," I think it works like this. You put in a buy order with a 99.99 limit on a stock that's trading around 100.00. The fact that you're doing this, rather than a market order or high limit, means that potentially making an extra cent is more important to you than making sure you actually get into the stock.  

If someone comes and sells to you, you're happy. You traded at a good price. And they're happy because they got to sell easily at a fair price.  

But if a lot of people come to sell to you, because of some news that you didn't read yet, you'll be less happy. Your limit price isn't as good of a deal for you any more, relative to the near future price of the stock, and the sellers are happy to pick off your order. High frequency traders use algorithms to detect these kind of shifts and become those sellers when possible before the other HFTs have time to adjust their quotes. IEX would basically apply the same type of algorithm (which they name the Crumbling Quote Indicator) on the exchange side and adjust your D-Limit price downward before the HFTs can pick it off.",kiwimancy,1,/r/investing/comments/lduce4/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gm915hd/,0.0,0.85,0.15,0.9837
356,AAPL," The theta on the 140 2/19 AAPL call is -.088.  The theta on the 145 2/19 AAPL call is -0.41.  So by selling the 145 call (last marked at [$0.59](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/AAPL/options/)), you'll cut your theta in half.

You will need to enter up to 2 additional trades.  You'll have to sell the 145's and then buy them back to close (if you don't let them go to expiry).  Depending on how you execute, you may lose some money on the bid-ask on both legs.

To close the new position you'd have to sell the 140 2/19 call and buy the 145 2/19 call.

357,IMO," You are only taxed on realized gains. The benefit to a Roth, aside from tax free withdrawals in retirement and continuing access to your contributions without penalty, is certainty. You're playing a known tax rate now against a projected tax rate in retirement. In truth, you have no idea what the brackets and rates will look like when you retire.

Beyond that, a traditional is honestly a shitty deal IMO. You can avoid taxation now on your contributions, but pay taxes on them later at hopefully a lower rate. Meanwhile your earnings are taxed, so you're actually mitigating (not avoiding) taxation on a maximum of 6000 to 7000 per year. With a roth, you suck up the tax hit on that same 6000 to 7000, but the earnings are tax free. So the real question becomes: do you expect to at a minimum recoup those taxes paid via tax free earnings inside the account.

I don't know. I think a lot of people have a stake in AMC now and they want to find evidence that it'll rebound, but if you do a basic SWOT I'm just not sure it's there. Streaming services are already here eating their lunch, and as the VR market grows, virtual theaters will eat a smaller, but significant part of their business. I think on a more macro level, video games, binge-worthy TV and social media are eating movies' lunch in the entertainment sector.

I think people love going to the theater as an experience, so that aspect of the business remains worthwhile, but just as a guess I'd say that's about 20% of the business if you can just watch movies at home or in home theaters (a lot of high end apartment complexes now offer screening rooms as an amenity), and even then I think that business consolidates towards theaters that are events, i.e. high end theaters like Arclight & independent cinema kinds of places. I think they may pivot to increasing the business of renting out theaters for events.

tldr I think the business will survive but it trends toward having more in common with 'events' venues than an entertainment distribution model, and not only is that a smaller business, but also has a learning curve.

Do I think I'm definitely right? No, it's very possible that restrictions subside much faster than I anticipate and everyone flocks straight back into movie theaters.

363,WWE," Warren Buffet is a big proponent in investing in what you know. If you're a big WWE fan, I'm not saying what you should or should not do, but you probably have a little more insight into the space than the average joe. You can combine that intuitive insight with looking at market indicators like the support and resistance lines, trends. Cursory glance at the stock, it looks like they haven't recovered to their pre-covid peak (which could mean room to grow), their p/e is pretty high and their debt seems high relative to income, but not dangerous. Not an analysis, just pointing out some stuff to pay attention to. Read their quarterly earnings report. Stuff like that.

I personally wouldn't be investing in live entertainment right now as an overall sector, but that's just me, and it's very possible some of these businesses bounce back strong. I tend to think live events are going to be suppressed below its 2019 performance in terms of years, not months. In WWE in specific, for the brief second I looked at it, it seems like they've pivoted heavily into digital events, so that would give me some heightened confidence. Though, Peacock isn't a deal for the WWE, it's a deal for Peacock. Imagine being WWE, ""You mean we get to be exclusively hosted on the SIXTH biggest media streaming platform?

364,WWE," They made more money this past year without running house shows.  House shows are a loss leader for them.

Peacock and Saudi and all of their other tv deals are priced in.  If they start running house shows again their revenue will go down, especially if they run them at the same frequency they used to.

Personally, I'd expect a decline in Network subscribers from the Peacock deal.  Why pay $9.99 when you can pay less and get the WWE stuff and the Peacock stuff?

383,KO," Nah I think if you have a decent dividend yield on a stock, it's great (I usually reinvest, I don't need the additional income).  I'd rather have a stock grow 20% and have no dividend than have a stock stay flat and earn a 4% dividend. That's all I mean. I've made a lot more money off my growth stock portfolio than my dividend portfolio. 

I view the dividend portfolio as a more stable and low risk, but in reality the numbers don't lie, the amount I'm making off a dividend yield focused portfolio pales in comparison to the amount I'm making off a growth focused portfolio. Dividends also force a taxable event which is annoying, but whatever. I do also have KO, I think it's a good stock.

A lot of people talk about 'living off the dividends', which is smart if you already have 2 million bucks and you don't really care about growing it, but I'm not 100% convinced a dividend yield focused strategy is the best way to build wealth. Your mileage may vary.

Ask yourself - why would the value of a stock increase?  The answer is the future potential of dividends (or stock buybacks).  Typically non-dividend companies are young and growing but not very profitable, whereas mature companies must offer dividend or nobody would invest.

Some thoughts...

1.) ""If you know that gold will increase in price would you invest in a company which finds gold or in one which sells shovels for digging of gold (and other minerals)... ""

I feel there is a benefit for a contrarian model here. Because it would be impossible to definitively know that the miner will outperform its competitors, it would be wiser (on a risk adj basis) to hold higher conviction in the picks and shovels but, if you are able to intelligently speculate in a single market participant, ie pick the winning miner, take a ""Kelly sized"" swing on the miner. I want to learn more about CWCO. 

2.) Thoughts on risk,   ""But one issue is that currently it heavily relies on tourism due to the location of it's plants.""  

In all cases where the product of a company fulfills a need at the base of Maslow's hierarchy in a direct fashion or by little to zero degree of separation to supplying that underlying commodity, regulation of profits via government intervention is an outsized risk to investors across all holding periods in the security. Statistically, this risk is probably even larger for long term holders. Thus making picking the single name in water even more challenging.

1. Their products are not essential but need a lot of water to produce. Sure Nestle sells water but their biggest income comes from other products like coffee and chocolate.
2. They are also already big and old companies so there is no reason to expect high % returns compared to CWCO which just costs $190 mil. and already has 2.4% dividends.
3. If water becomes 10 times more expensive in 30 years people would think before they buy coffee, beer, coke or chocolate because it will be a lot more expensive.
4. They acquire water sources now BUT there will be heavy political control over such precious assets in the long term. No government will be crazy enough to sign it's own death penalty by selling the only water resources it has to a private corporation.

412,PBF," >which is the difference between crude oil and refined products. Because of this, I think the safest oil bets are within the Downstream sector, since they are least affected by the price of oil, and only rely on the return of oil demand.

So, PBF as a refiner still is exposed to oil prices, they just happen to have short physical exposure, rather than being long the physical on the E&P side. Not only that, you're still subject to commodity price volatility on the refined products side (gas/diesel/jet fuel), you just happen to have a physical long position on the products side. So if anything, it's doubly risky than upstream since crude vs refined products prices don't move in tandem with one another.

True, PBF does have a high NCI and can handle all the heavy/sour crude coming out of Southern CA, but most of that production is generally legacy conventional wells that have been producing for decades, so you can expect lower production, with every barrel you pull out the ground growing more expensive (and no body is spending the capex on dev drilling out there any time soon, not sure they could if they wanted to in the CA regulatory environment). Good chance that NCI competitive advantage eventually becomes moot, particularly with political and regulatory developments that'll take place in Canada in the near-to-mid term. Also, I'd just note that NCI doesn't tell you much - how efficiently that PBF operates the asset is what is important here (walking the walk, rather than just talking the talk, so to speak).

Also, I haven't been through PBF/PBFX's filings in a few month, but I'd venture to guess that the entirety of their cash flow is coming from PBFX distributions.

413,PBFX," >which is the difference between crude oil and refined products. Because of this, I think the safest oil bets are within the Downstream sector, since they are least affected by the price of oil, and only rely on the return of oil demand.

So, PBF as a refiner still is exposed to oil prices, they just happen to have short physical exposure, rather than being long the physical on the E&P side. Not only that, you're still subject to commodity price volatility on the refined products side (gas/diesel/jet fuel), you just happen to have a physical long position on the products side. So if anything, it's doubly risky than upstream since crude vs refined products prices don't move in tandem with one another.

415,PBF," It is true that California's legacy well production has been steadily decreasing for years, but that has been offset by imports of [foreign crude.](https://www.energy.ca.gov/data-reports/energy-almanac/californias-petroleum-market/oil-supply-sources-california-refineries) This trend has been going on for years, and despite that, PBF has consistently maintained strong margins on the west coast. PBF's strongest cash flows come from their west coast refineries, and last year they acquired the Martinez refinery, which should only strengthen their west coast cash flows when oil demand returns.

It is true that refiners are exposed to both price volitility of Crude and refined products, but PBF has refineries in every PADD block except PADD 4, so they have more access to a diversified selection of crude blends, which can minimize their exposure to the volatility of crude-refined product margins.",QEIsVeryBad,1,/r/investing/comments/ldr61e/why_i_think_pbf_energy_is_undervalued/gm8xcyp/,0.114,0.764,0.122,0.0644
416,PBF," Those are good points.  I used the January 2020 because that's the last investment deck on their investor relations website.

Since then, you're right, production capacity should be higher because of Martinez (but utilization lower because of covid), but they've added over $2 billion in long-term debt which will affect interest expense with total long-term debt of [$3.7 billion](https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/pbf_energy3/SEC/sec-show.aspx?FilingId=14480084&Cik=0001566011&Type=PDF&hasPdf=1) an increase from $1.3 billion at year-end 2019.

418,PBF," Speaking as someone in the refining economics world I can tell you that there is little direct connection between crude pricing and product pricing. Refineries have very little control over their own margins. Main reason? Huge amounts of tank space on both ends of the refining model. Provides a bit of a buffer to pricing. It benefits integrated companies better over the long run because they can leverage other parts of the supply chain during different times to turn a consistent profit. Refining only companies are wholly subject to cyclical pricing. 

Of course when times are good, refining only companies can make bank for the exact reason you stated. In the case of the subject company PBF, I think they are poised for a strong Q3 and Q4 2021 if things continue as they have.

419,PBF," I mean, the margins are a nice improvement, but it still doesn't address the clusterfuck that is PBF's 2021 liquidity problem. They'd need to generate ~$700mm in 2021E EBITDA just to cover maintenance capex ($400mm 2021E) and interest ($300mm 2021E, which includes the notes that they recently issued), and consensus research estimates are showing around $200mm in 2021E EBITDA, ($60mm) in 2021E EBITDA if you break out the portion attributable to PBFX. And I think they've only got around $200mm left in RCF availability, and that's before Q4 numbers come out.

So suffice to say, just doing 10 minutes of basic EDGAR back of the envelope math makes me super concerned about PBF as a long term strategy. There's a VERY strong possibility that PBF defaults on their notes outstanding (although I'm not sure if Blackstone would let that happen), revolver capacity shrinks drastically, credit downgrades, and obvious hits to share price.

Its way more nuanced and complex than that when you're actually employed by Bridgewater or Point72 and not someone who views trading as a fix until fantasy gears back up in August. Could be institutions are trying to synthetically gain exposure to a company/specific risk that isn't available from just going long on a particular ticker - e.g. creating a position via a basket of long/short positions on different assets/classes of assets. Google Put-Call Option Parity for more on the topic.

(b) is **far far far more important** and tbh is pretty terrifying that you didn't consider it while making a post about beating the market by reading SEC filings (because you know that smart money definitely hasn't already figure that out the importance of company disclosures that have been legally required for 90 years....).

473,EV," My contrarian view is more about the hydrogen economy then Hyzon. 

The hydrogen based power for personal transportation was a great idea but with the way we produce hydrogen the efficiency isn't really there. VW had a great press release showing the difference. 

When you want power for a standard EV you plug into the grid. From this about 70-80% of the power you draw goes to make the tires spin. For Hydrogen there a bunch of extraneous costs to fill your tank. First hydrogen is produced through electrolysis taking a large portion of energy, then it has to be compressed as the electrolysis process doesn't quite produce the pressure to pack it.  Next the hydrogen has to be transported to your personal vehicle and energy goes into the filling of the vehicle. Finally you can drive it. This amounts to about an energy efficiency of 25-35%.

There is a huge amount of infrastructure that needs to be built to make it a viable alternative. Why spend the energy on electrolysis when you could just put that energy directly in a car. 

I do think that hydrogen power might beneficial at a certain scale or specific usage problems such as cargo ships. 

I think the real use for Hydrogen will only come when we produce viable fusion.",Whiteboard_Knight,4,/r/investing/comments/ldsiod/any_contrarian_analysis_on_hyzon/gm8rx0o/,0.029,0.807,0.164,0.9836
474,EV," Sure. So I want first say, my bullishness on hydrogen and hydrogen stocks in from a long term investment view based on accumulating  most positions between March and June 2020. I wouldn’t add to my positions at their present valuations for the stocks I own (with the exception of one). I am however still interested in individual companies in the renewable space. 

So I like hydrogen for the simple fact that industries and economies will not put all their eggs in one basket and will want to diversify their energy options. Just look at the current ev battery situation. There’s a serious shortage in battery materials which will not be remedied before hydrogen technology is cheap and scaleable enough to be a viable option.  A for that reason there will continue to be big investments into hydrogen technology and associated companies. For a good example, look at Tesla. Their long haul truck is on hold because there simply aren’t enough materials for batteries, with the batteries Tesla can produce going to their cars. So basically the shortage of EV batteries with accelerate hydrogen investments. 

I do think there are applications that hydrogen will dominate over Solar like heavy industry, shipping and even air travel. Hydrogen is just better suited for those applications.",kingoftheoneliners,2,/r/investing/comments/ldsiod/any_contrarian_analysis_on_hyzon/gm8uj1j/,0.031,0.868,0.1,0.9309

476,HOLI," I have it in my radar for quite some time, but haven't stepped in and probably won't.

I 'll share some thoughts in general, saying first i haven't deep dived into it's business, just the numbers.

HOLI is an obvious value play, a deeply undervalued company in respect with it's fundamentals. The first thing i ask my self in such occasions is ""WHY""? Why does the market treat it in this way? The market maybe wrong temporarilly, but rarely for long periods.

Usually the answer is that the market (ie the players, investors etc) don't see future prospect in the business. HOLI seems to be accumulatingCash and Book Value but in the meantime Revenue and Income are stagnating. They are as healthy as a company can be, but they seem like they don't know what to do with their resources (aka Cash). Are there plans for new investments, for Growth generation? If not, they should at least return more value to the shareholders, ie upscaling dividends, i 'm not very fond of buybacks.

To cut a long story short, the reason it's so undervalued is the opportunity cost imo. Why should someone go for the 1.33% dividend or the 5% ROE, in this market where he could make +100% in a few months almost riskfree getting into a SPAC just above $10, having the reimbursement of $10 if things go wrong?

That's my take, sure it's healthy, sure it creates value, but there seems to be a lack of vision and the value doesn't find it's way to the shareholders.",Barry_Wuffett,1,/r/investing/comments/ldzzz3/hollysys_automation_holi/gm8v9n2/,0.073,0.743,0.184,0.987

482,FVRR," I've been long FVRR for a while, it was a good investment. I got out last month, I'm not comfortable holding here not because of the current freelance market landscape but because of the overall digitalisation of work which is likely to bring fresh alternatives/competition. FVRR's biggest threat is not Upwork, but Facebook. The more FVRR grows and the more likely it is for Facebook to step in. Facebook could smoothly transition into the freelance business, for example on Instagram you already see this happening with a lot of designers who create pages there with their work and use it to funnel sales.

I'm also not a fan of how FVRR is managed, it's too aggressive with users. Might look like a good thing from a managerial point of view, but too much optimisation kills growth. From my experience it has a really tightly controlled marketplace, which hinders growth. For this I prefer Upwork personally, the overall experience is much better. It's true that Upwork has lost money by letting me exchange skype with some freelancers, but at the same time they have also made a lot more money than FVRR (from me) by letting me be on the platform. With a lot of freelancers with whom I have exchanged skype I still pay them via Upwork a lot of times, although we use skype because it's more effective for me to maintain communication with them via skype while work is in progress. FVRR wouldn't let me do this. They banned my account a long time ago for trying to hire a freelancer outside their platform. Understandable. These strict policies may seem justified, but I'm sure they have alienated a lot of good potential customers. On the seller side I have heard a lot of similar stories, people with skills kicked out/banned.

So while it made sense to hold fvrr last year, I believe in 2021 it will be flat or go downhilll. There are 2 scenarios both of which bleak, unless the management changes approach to a more libertarian one. First scenario, Facebook/Linkedin enter the freelance space, then that would be a huge blow. Second scenario, no competition from Facebook/linkedin emerges, then I still think FVRR has created a hostile brand for a lot of freelancers (the company has been banning people since 2010). There are at least 2 generations of freelancers which may have also acquired a lot of new skills in the meantime that have been cut out of the platform, I don't see FVRR ever recovering them. Same applies for buyers. This is why I don't see any promising growth prospects in 2021.",zeroboundss,2,/r/investing/comments/ldlhym/fvrr_a_diamond_in_the_rough_in_plain_sight/gm6pw5z/,0.074,0.755,0.171,0.9918

484,FVRR," Just some food for thought, I would compare FVRR to upwork, Upwork has more revenue yet market cap is lower, all of a sudden fiverr doesn’t seem so undervalued anymore. It may seem like a steal comparing to Etsy but I think Etsy itself is a bit overvalued at this point.

487,FVRR," >Facebook has often blocked posts and deleted accounts of users.

This is actually the main reason why I see fiverr going sidelines/flat this year and maybe imploding after a couple of years. Because FVRR is 10x worse than facebook when it comes to cutting out/deplatforming users and flexing its muscles. I've been banned as a buyer, but I know also of A LOT of sellers who have been permanently banned from operating there after making a living on the platform for years. I understand they may have infringed ToS, or done mistakes, but permanently banning so many buyers and freelancers with no possibility to recourse/appeal/learn has definitely damaged their brand beyond repair. Do a search online, none of them who have been banned recommend FVRR, a lot of them raise important questions about the whole process. In the beginning the impact of these posts was (maybe) negligible, but FVRR has been treating everyone as fungible for 10 years now and sooner or later that will blow back on their brand.",zeroboundss,2,/r/investing/comments/ldlhym/fvrr_a_diamond_in_the_rough_in_plain_sight/gm6rttt/,0.135,0.807,0.058,-0.9209

489,DBX, I’m not sure DBX will beat the strong competition when it comes to cloud storage. If they are to rise above $35 (my analysis for the year) it is because of succes with their collab efforts plans. The company who eventually manages to have sufficient and solid cloud sharing and collaboration tools that work intuitively will be running away with the other share money. Not sure if dropbox will eventually figure this out better than Microsoft which is quite a bit ahead on them. I still avoid dropbox as a user if I can and turn to gdrive or iCloud instead if I can. It’s hit or miss this one I believe. I’m not touching it quite yet because I’m not convinced they’re gonna pull off what they planned yet.,Leffery,2,/r/investing/comments/ldi1gg/heres_why_dbx_is_an_insane_value_play_right_now/gm60kgp/,0.073,0.833,0.094,0.5883

491,RH," I just did this process. My whole shares are showing in my Fidelity account and the $75 transfer fee seemed to come out of the cash on my Fidelity account. It showed as a margin deficit on F. I talked to Fidelity and they told me RH would bill me instead of take from my F account, but that doesn't seem to be the case at this point. I did ask about them covering the fee, but they told me they only cover for accounts over $25k, which mine is not. I'm not happy about it, but I'll eat the 75 to have the rest of my money in an account I trust. My RH account now only shows my fractional shares, which according to their website, will be sold and transferred as cash to F after a week or two when they do a resdiual sweep and clear the rest of your account.",lolsteakaments,1,/r/investing/comments/ldrwjp/confusion_relating_to_transferring_brokers/gm9fjkv/,0.012,0.889,0.099,0.9276
492,CEO," The problem with stop-losses is that stocks frequently don't go down gradually.  The drop suddenly - frequently after an earnings release or other news.

Say you buy at $100 and put your stop loss at $90.  It trades down a bit an closes today at $91.15.  Still above your stop loss.  Then earnings are released and they appear to be crappy, and the stock opens at $77.  You end up selling and losing 23% - not 10% of your investment.

Then, to really turn the knife, the drop to $77 was only the initial reaction to the release.  After the conference call and the CEO going on CNBC, it turns out the numbers weren't as bad as they were initially thought to be, *and* the future guidance is bullish.  The stock actually ends up gradually climbing all day and closes at $92.

495,IAC," The discount has existed for years now. Prosus (the Tencent investment and other Naspers venture investments) was spun off by Naspers with the hope that it would narrow the discount after several years and investor complaints. It didn't. One of the issues is that for a long time the Tencent investment was really kind of a one-hit wonder - some investments (Delivery Hero) have done well more recently but for a long time Tencent was the only real substantial success. Tencent itself has been a much better capital allocator with all of the various investments that that has made, many of which have done very well. Even Softbank despite some misses has done well. Or IAC in the US. At this point I wouldn't go in expecting the discount to narrow any time soon. It's a way to invest in Tencent at a discount (and that discount may narrow...someday?) and hopefully some other investments take off.",dvdmovie1,2,/r/investing/comments/ldvqkq/prosusprx_is_super_undervalued/gm80st4/,0.011,0.835,0.154,0.9705
