0,IMO, I’ve had some success picking up beaten up dividend stocks (with a corresponding high yield) with the idea that I’d sit and collect a nice divvie if nothing else.

1,PLTR," Bro you could make more gains pissing into a pile of cash and then setting it on fire than PLTR this year haha. 

Also because a company is paying dividends doesn’t necessarily mean it’s doing well.

For most dividends are too slow of a return. Sure there’s loads of YouTube videos out there about “how to earn 5k a month passive income” but what many don’t go into is just how long this take and how much you need to invest to achieve this (millions).

Divs are good for older people when they already have good capital - for younger people not so much imo.",DoctorDeeeerp,1,/r/investing/comments/o3r8iu/i_think_dividends_are_underrated/h2f4sfw/,0.033,0.821,0.146,0.8875
2,XOM," They have their place just as growth stocks do. Many stable or defensive companies or sectors will be high dividend payers for a good reason. High market caps in consumer staples, oil companies, utilities, etc. do not have high growth potential so most excess cash either buys back stock or pays dividends (or, if you're Apple, sits as cash and depreciates). Allocating to certain sectors means dividends are incidental.

Maybe your preference is buybacks, but paying dividends can be more flexible since the shareholder has the choice to reinvest or take the cash. Paying a dividend also stabilises the share price and your portfolio in different ways to buybacks. If a stock bubble or oil price spike temporarily doubles the XOM share price, buybacks are less and less efficient as the price spikes, while you still get your 4% dividend paid out on your original investment throughout.

If you are in retirement, you don't want to sell 4% of your holdings, due to necessity for income, at the bottom of a 50% bear market. What if the bear market lasts 3 years? Let the company pay you 4% out of their cash reserves or low interest debt and the (hopefully) temporary share price drop is not important for you.

People tracking the S&P500 or US growth stocks have done great, but that is not always so easy. Consider how Japanese investors would have done investing in the Nikkei 225 over long periods... Consider how your portfolio would perform in a 10 year period of stagflation or zero growth (or negative) in disposable incomes.",obb223,1,/r/investing/comments/o3r8iu/i_think_dividends_are_underrated/h2fabne/,0.045,0.791,0.163,0.9872

11,ALL," Yes, and you can chart out growth on some sites based on reinvestment of dividends vs taking the cash, and over time you can see that reinvestment of dividend payments can really help compound the growth. 

I do love boring companies that have consistently paid and grown their dividend over decades, if not over a century or more. My first couple of stock picks when I first starting investing around ‘06-‘07 have done very well - I built up my positions and, although I cannot / do not invest in these now (Roth IRA, over income limit), they now grow themselves through reinvestment of dividends plus market growth.

13,UI," Nah, I made money the old fashion way through years of hard work :)

I did sell most of my holdings though. I don't advise most people try to time the market, especially in a taxable account if you have a lot of unrealized gains.

But I do think CPI will continue to trend higher than expected (look at shipping, oil price trends, retail sales data, rents etc).

It's also pretty clear at this point that enhanced UI benefits are the primary culprit behind unemployment. Number of open jobs is at an all time high, employers are desperate to hire, and many companies have hiked wages. 

So what do these two points mean? Most likely the Fed will have to confront an economy with low unemployment and high CPI inflation before the end of the year. People are way too complacent with the transient story. It will be transient, but over a much longer timeframe than people are expecting 

Psychologically a lot of the market is hinging on the Fed's actions, so any increased hawkishness from them will send it toppling.

Also, forward PE is at an all time high (at least since dotcom days), so market is priced very high. Even when discounting for interest rates",strawlion,4,/r/investing/comments/o3r8iu/i_think_dividends_are_underrated/h2dmjkt/,0.085,0.811,0.103,0.7284

32,AAPL," Lots of people here don't understand bonds and advise others to just stick with stocks, don't listen to them.

Here's what you need to know. 

First, most bonds  (excepting US treasuries) trade more like used cars than stocks. Each trade is unique and not exactly comparable. Because of this, bond traders are specialized. If you just put in an order and try to buy a few thousand dollars worth of a specific bond, you are going to overpay by a substantial amount. You need to be buying round lots ($100k worth) and know what you are doing to get a good price. Because of this, most retail investors should avoid buying individual bonds (except treasuries) and stick with bond funds.

There's many many more types of bonds than stocks in the US. There's one AAPL stock, but they probably have a dozen different types of bonds. Every city, county, school district, hospital, etc issues multiple types of bonds.

All the research saying passive investing (index funds) beats active investing is about stocks, not bonds. People just assume it's the same, but it's not. You'll make more in an actively managed bond fund than in an index bond fund.

Most bonds will have lower volatility and lower returns than typical stocks, but this can be adjusted up with leverage. An easy way to invest in these are with CEFs, which often use leverage.

Here's the total returns for PDI, a bond cef over the past eight years: 12%,20%, 6%, 18%, 19%, 8%, 23%, -9%, and (ytd in 2021) 13%. Because a large part of the total returns are paid out in distributions, it's best to reinvest the dividends and hold them in a tax advantaged account.

If you are in a high tax state, (CA, for example), and in a high tax bracket, it makes sense to be in a state specific municipal bond fund. One example is PCQ for California. This muni bond cef currently has a yield of 4.18% tax-free, which is the equivalent of about 8% taxable. I have about a third of my taxable account in these types of investments, because I'm quite happy to take a near certain 8%.

I think everyone should have exposure to bonds. Anyone who puts 100% of their money in a single asset class really just doesn't know what they are doing.

35,USA," I just want to post one thing that sort of bothers me with bonds, yes bonds is an asset class on its own but individual bonds act very different than each other

The statement ""Bonds are negatively correlated with the stock market"" is true , and false because it really depends what bonds you are talking about.

There are bonds (corp high yeild , lower grade aka junk bonds) that basically act like stock and are very correlated with stock; they are also less affected by interest rate changes. The major risk with these bonds is if the company defaults not if the FFR jumps 0.75%

Then on the other end there are short term USA government debt, This basically doesn't do anything because its almost cash. If rates go up it is affected little because the duration is short.

Then you have long term government bonds, now these really move with rate changes, a small change in rates can push these 20% up or down. These long term bonds have the least amount of correlation to the equities market, and if you play with the time period they are lots of time negatively correlated .

So ""bonds"" is a broad term and you really cannot speak with them using generalizations.

42,VERY," Greenblatt's strategy at the core makes sense: buy businesses with good internal profit metrics that are currently out of favor. The statistical evidence that this is a good strategy is very strong.

However, there are caveats.

(1) the time period he executed this strategy, ""value"" in general was performing well, but it has not been doing well lately. Have the times changed so it doesn't work any more, or is that strategy just cyclically underperforming, as happens sometimes? Nobody knows.

(2) The reason that not everyone does this strategy is that the returns are VERY lumpy year to year -- among the ""magic formula"" portfolio there will be loser companies, and among the years you execute the strategy, there will be years where it dramatically underperforms.

Saying ""it works if you keep doing the strategy every year for 10 years"" does not protect you from yourself in any given year, because it's very hard to keep faithfully executing a strategy while watching some of the companies fail horribly, watching everyone else make money while you're not, etc etc. 

Mutual fund managers have tried to use this strategy, but the problem is that their clients all bail out when there's an underperforming year, and then jump back in when it's doing well - selling low and buying high, as investors are wont to do. These funds have failed because investors can't stick with them.

So that's why not everybody does it: it's hard to execute, and if you're getting a bad outcome, you have no way to know if it's because the strategy has stopped working, or because you're just in an unlucky year (this will only be knowable in hindsight)...

As you seem to be planning to invest a large sum of money, I'd suggest using magic formula for only a portion of your portfolio. Do the rest in some other more conventional strategy like index funds. That gives you some protection against yourself, making it easier to stick out the bad years.

You could also save yourself the time and effort of executing the strategy by buying an actively-managed value fund from a good manager- because in a year where magic formula does well, those funds will do great also because they're operating off the same core principles.",PrefersDigg,14,/r/investing/comments/o3q0fn/anybody_following_magic_formula_investing/h2du3yd/,0.106,0.785,0.109,-0.3945

48,MSFT," I'm saying it's more complicated than what you think. So ignoring the idea of timing the market let's examine the idea of a future winner and future loser.

MSFT is a poster child of value. It released at a reasonable price and skyrocketed to make millionaires out of secretaries.

If you go back to the beginning the IPO behaved a certain way. Contrary to your (and all of ours) idea of value.

It traded sideways. Why? 

Because IPOs believed in it. Strongly. They analyzed it. And they released it at a true value.

MSFT was not undervalued or overvalued at IPO. And it grew like a rocket shortly after. 

Do you think Goldman Sachs who underwrite them did not understand the potential value?

Of course they did....

Because of how IPOs benefit the underwriters, getting a winner the right price helps them bank on their future success. 

If the price shoots up after IPO the underwriters lose money.

If it tanks, the company loses money.

Neither are good for either.

Therefore when evaluating your future winner the first thing you should ask is what did your future winner's ipo do?

50,NEW," I believe the answer you are looking for is:

-- When the Local Dollar is strong / $USD weak, you want to expand your $USD holdings

-- When the Local Dollar is weak / $USD strong, you want to avoid NEW $USD purchases and/or sell off your current $USD holdings



Taking this approach will allow you to maximize the currency fluctuations. 
For example, in my case, my Local Dollar is $CAD. 

-- Right now $CAD is trading at approx. $1.00 CAD per $0.80 USD. So I am losing 20 cents/dollar every time I make a move.
 
-- Compare that, say, when it drops to $1.00 CAD per $0.60 USD. Then I'm losing 40 cents/dollar every time I make a move.

-- So you want to **convert/buy $USD when you are getting the most for your money, ie. at the $0.80 currency exchange.** Buying right now will only cost me 20 cents/dollar to make a move.

-- Conversely, you want to **convert/sell your $USD when you are getting the lowest exchange rate, ie. the $0.60 currency exchange.** Selling at that time will yield almost 2 Canadian Dollars for each $USD sold.



I hope this helps explain things a little clearer and inform your decisions.

Currently employed earning £33,000~
I don't want to work forever and will be buying what will be my second home (but my partner's first) this year with the views to selling my first home (solely in my name). I have saved a separate deposit for this and I'm not dependant on the sale of my home to fund this.

Obviously buying a property that has a small amount of work needing done and decorating to less of a standard is an option though.

60,ABC," You really should focus on total return

Total return is capital appreciation + Dividends.

In simple terms lets say stock ABC appreciates 2% and pays a 6% dividend

Stock XYZ pays no dividend but appreciates 8%. They have the same total return, the dividend paying stock isn't better really , or worse (I actually would argue its worse as it forces you to recognize income what has tax consequences were the non-dividend paying stock is at your discretion)

However chasing yeild usually does not result in better total returns. If you look at popular dividend focused funds SCHD, SPHD, VYM , just compare there returns to some total market or S&P500 fund(VTI/VOO), the total market fund almost always out perform.

Once retired you do not even need dividens with low cost trading you can make your own dividend by selling X% of your holdings .

Now your individual stock picks are pretty good, they do outperform but your lowest dividend payers and actually making up most of the gains (apple and micdondals)

Now I am not saying avoid dividends, I am not saying invest in only growth stocks that don't pay dividends, I am saying don't make investment choices around dividends, invest in good companies if you want to invest in individual companies, some of those companies pay dividends some do not.

Fraud is intentional. If they make a mistake on their taxes, that's a mistake, not fraud. I've made mistakes before and had the IRS send me friendly letters suggesting I owed more than I did. I fixed the mistake and owed less than they suggested. They were happy with my response.

But to answer your question, tax software nowadays imports information straight from brokerages. Even if they don't, they expect you to enter in your stock purchase/sale dates, share dispositions, etc. They will figure out the wash sale stuff for you. The only way to avoid having the wash sale rule not triggered if it should be triggered is to intentionally lie while filing out your taxes - and that is fraud. It's not accidental.

Also, brokerages report 1099-Bs to the IRS for stock sales.

82,NVAX," Well said, the odds are stacked against individual stock pickers.

The best case scenario in gambling is almost a 50/50 chance(table games: blackjack, craps, etc). Any given stock is well less than that. Of the some 4k publicly traded stocks in the US, roughly 20% of them account for all the gains. So you have roughly a 20% chance of winning best case. Or roughly 800 stocks out of the 4k publicly traded US stocks account for basically all the gains in a given year.  Can you pick one of the 800? 

In 2020, [NVAX](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=2020&firstMonth=1&endYear=2020&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=NVAX&allocation1_1=100) had a 2,701.76% growth year, beating every other stock in the market. $10,000 in NVAX invested Jan 2020 would be worth $280,176 Jan of 2021, 1 year later. Of course who had any idea in Jan of 2020 that a Biotech Vaccine company would be the giant winner a year later? In March 2020, of course, but in January? Nobody.

85,NVAX," I never said it wasn't.  I just said, the odds of picking the winner is basically impossible. The odds of picking the top 20% is also very low.  Some people do it occasionally, but so far nobody has shown strong talent picking only winners, and only rarely does anyone do any good beating the total market for any length of time.

Buffet is basically the only one that's had any luck beating the market for any prolonged length of time, and in the past decade or so, he hasn't been able to do that.  I'm still a fan of his investing ability, it's certainly better than mine.

To be clear by ""prolonged length of time"", I mean an investors investment life-time, so 20-30 years.  There have been very, very few that have managed... sort of like the # of entrepreneurs that have managed to amass giant sums of wealth like Musk, Bezos or Rockefeller.

But I agree the payout(s) on individual stocks are in theory unlimited, and with gambling, it's pretty rare to do more than double your money, and you know the reward going in, but rarely the risk.

I'm not against you picking individual stocks, go for it! I wish you luck, but if you EXPECT to pick the next NVAX, well... you will almost certainly be in for disappointment.

Another option is to be lazy, own the entire market and do other things with your time, knowing that you will in general double your money every decade for basically free.

I personally have a small percentage of my portfolio in individual stocks – largely tech. But my philosophy is that if the Internet went kaput tomorrow and those stocks went down to $0, I wouldn't really miss the money that much in the grand scheme of things. Overall I think diversification is key for a lot of reasons, even if that means investing in an ETF or fund that has a few dozen companies like Zillow and Square. (Just one example: ARKF has 50 stocks, and Z + SQ make up \~15% of it.)

I'm not going to sit here and argue you should invest all your money in total market index funds, but 40 years is a long time – and you don't need an obscene average return to have some pretty sizable growth over that time.
