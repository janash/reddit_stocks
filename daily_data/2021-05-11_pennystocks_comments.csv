0,UK," A lot of their workforce are based in the town i was from Derby, my dad and granddad worked for them all their lives, there is no way any UK government would let them fail, it would decimate the entire region and this area has just started trending conservative who are the UK government currently and any labour government with any hope of winning these voters back would never let RR fail.",mataranka,11,/r/pennystocks/comments/n9swuc/rolls_royce_rr_rycey_ceo_purchases_shares_at_20p/gxqm8v7/,0.114,0.807,0.078,-0.4404
1,UK," Completely disagree with some of the sentiment here.

RR isn't *just* a civil aerospace engine manufacturer. It has a large defence and nuclear role within the UK and NATO countries. 

The majority of RR engines are for longer flights. And RR makes money when these planes are flying. Right now, this isn't happening but they have the cash and assets to make it through. With fantastic pipeline products waiting for a use! 

The dilution means nothing? All those who were diluted bought maintained their share by buying in. Using Yahoo finance as a guide, the share price is 1/3 of what it was pre-covid. There's good scope here for growth.",ztotheookey,6,/r/pennystocks/comments/n9swuc/rolls_royce_rr_rycey_ceo_purchases_shares_at_20p/gxr7xiu/,0.016,0.808,0.176,0.9604

4,IMO," There will be no buy out or merger IMO. They have very good long term revenue prospects because of their government contracts. RR PLC is very institutional. Any merger or buyout that would occur would be with another UK-based company (because of Brexit). IMO BAE is the only company that would be able to merge/buy out RR PLC, but that would take years of litigation to sort out. I understand the two to already have ongoing collaboration with the Tempest program.

In the commercial aviation sector, I haven't read anything that implies they're *not* working on an engine platform suitable for narrow body- keep in mind that any such platform takes years to develop. I don't expect that they will divest from the segment.",ItsYaBoyDonny1,14,/r/pennystocks/comments/n9swuc/rolls_royce_rr_rycey_ceo_purchases_shares_at_20p/gxq8q71/,0.031,0.94,0.03,-0.0267
5,UK," My father-in-law worked there for years too, and I see an endless stream of openings in my area of work, could be a good sign or a bad sign. Never worked there but would consider it - some of the contracts I see in my inbox look very attractive. Also, if I'm not mistaken, according to their latest annual report roughly half their operating profit comes from the defence sector.

Would the UK government let them fail? Well I wouldn't trust a Tory as far as I could throw them when it comes to preserving British industry, but I agree it would certainly win a few extra Labour votes in Derbyshire were they to pledge to keep RR afloat.",BirdFluLol,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/n9swuc/rolls_royce_rr_rycey_ceo_purchases_shares_at_20p/gxr6tyk/,0.078,0.713,0.21,0.9517

I have mine in trust wallet.  Others have theirs in atomic wallet or metamask.  I get that.  This was my first crypto purchase.  Once you have your wallet setup, you have to send it to your eth/collectibles/erc20 address (they should all be the same address, I sent it to my ETH and collectibles addresses in different transactions and they all showed up fine).  In order to see them, you have to ""add custom token"" by using the contract number for the coin (currently listed on their site).  After that you should see them populate once your wallet receives them.  It took me a while to figure it out because the instructions weren't laid out.  Now that enough people have done it, the process should be straightforward.  Feel free to let me know if you get lost.  Keep in mind that the current minimum is $250 (125 coins) +2.99% fee.

69,CTXR," I liquidated most of my stocks the last few days. I am definitely being more paranoid, but I didnt have any long term holds with instant forsure catalysts besides CTXR. I figure I'll atleast have a chance to buy back in after Wednesday when the inflation data comes out.

Also looking at the NASDAQ futures(-1.12% currently) , we're in for another red day tomorrow",samchih,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/n9lgkg/discussion_summer_market_forecast_strategy/gxohdql/,0.027,0.902,0.071,0.4026
70,DD," I bought a small stake last week. I didn't do a ton of DD, it's main draw to me was that it had a steady price of roughly 1$ for about a year, then dropped 50% in the middle of April because of an offering. My bet is that it's gonna get at least a good chunk of that back in the next few months.",wolfcrieswolf,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/na0en5/job_gee_group_inc/gxqt9dz/,0.0,0.952,0.048,0.4404

74,RIOT," I did the math on Riot and its way overvalued.  I suspect Hive is the same.  Multiply the rate of mining by 12 to represent future gains.  Add coins on the asset sheet.  Multiple the value times 5 times the current price of Bitcoin.  Without factoring expenses I could not justify the market cap of RIOT if bitcoin went up to 250K by end of year.

The big miners have been way overbought.  I wish I had sold the option spread I bought on Riot before Coinbase instead of trying to eck out a huge gain instead of a respectable one.  Taught me that I do well when I evaluate instead of speculate.  

Evaluate Hive and see if you can get a number that merits the current valuation even if the coins skyrocket.  I suspect you can’t.

This is the opposite of physical miners, where you usually are buying the underlying at a discount.",ReadStoriesAndStuff,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/n9ldz0/whats_going_on_with_hive_no_correlation_to_eth_or/gxom3ga/,0.096,0.755,0.149,0.6972
