123,EAST," Hello Friends, 

Iâ€™m new to this community. I would like your take on a few please : 

Ctxr- will it go higher? Iâ€™m interested in the mino-lok as a healthcare provider. If it really does reduce the chances of post surgical infections and ease of use is really superior, I can see this being a winner. Whatâ€™s your price targets? 

Mimi- micro cap Canadian company selling vitamins (with name brand recognition), reasonably priced skin care products on Amazon with good reviews and they are breaking into the dog vitamin space. Has a good PE ratio. Do you think this is a good long term hold at $0.33 a stock? 

Htl- Hamilton Thorne- IVF technologies and clinics, charts look good on growth. But PE ratios pretty high. 

OPK- insiders buying up a lot in the last week. Do you think itâ€™s at the bottom and a good entry point? 

EAST - Brewery, with new management and they just bought a winery. Do you think this company has long term potential?

231,ATOS," That's how I'm feeling. I don't personally know enough about ""SQUEEZERZ"" to really jump on the hype of any one incident of it, however looking at things I better understand such as market cap, I'm learning a lot of these plays get overvalued to the point it doesn't even make sense anymore, and it feels like that threshold doesn't play around in a less-than-bullish market such as the present. I almost went balls deep in ATOS this morning but chose what felt like the much safer overall play for me, a non-OTC which was WISH (feels undervalued no matter what the company itself represents).

I really wish I could understand squeezes better in context of how shorts/MM'S/whatever you want to call them can play them, because after they appeared to just straight up pause the market during the last ""very well known"" retail squeezes to catch up/screw retail investors or whatever their motivations were, it heavily traumatized me.
