0,ETH, I just bought some more ETH. Whether stocks or crypto it’s all a gamble in most aspects. Yes you can focus on ETF’s and company’s like Blackrock which will give small returns over time. But whether stocks or crypto you need to be stoic and understand markets fluctuate,Appropriate-Pear4726,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/nj80v2/return_to_penny_stocks_imminent/gz664dc/,0.0,0.922,0.078,0.4096
1,AI, Stock market is hands on manipulated by the feds. Crypto market mostly by AI algorithm (more consistent),Legal-Quail8298,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/nj80v2/return_to_penny_stocks_imminent/gz759xa/,0.14,0.86,0.0,-0.3818

3,ETH, We are literally getting ETH 2.0 in a couple months which will drastically cut energy usage and gas costs. And who gives a fuck about “the elders”? Those old men can cuddle up in their mansions with their oil stock certificates,ladydanger2020,7,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/nj80v2/return_to_penny_stocks_imminent/gz63221/,0.128,0.824,0.048,-0.5423
4,ETH, Stupid question..  will eth 2.0 replace 1.0? Will I need to sell my current ETH share and grab 2.0?,teh_longinator,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/nj80v2/return_to_penny_stocks_imminent/gz64ey0/,0.171,0.729,0.1,-0.3736
5,NYC," I’m literally saying the exact same thing as you.

I bought my first Bitcoin after I watched a video of a guy buying pizza in NYC, this was maybe 2014? I’m pretty aware of what’s going on although I will ALWAYS take in more info because thinking youre to smart is exactly how you become dumb. 

And when I said “for months” I’m saying that it was time to sell for months, I dont know what you’re talking about in that regard.",BladeG1,-2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/nj80v2/return_to_penny_stocks_imminent/gz640jr/,0.041,0.887,0.073,0.3818
6,IP," The claim is not that penny stocks are accurately valued, but that in general there is some intrinsic value to them. They hold assets, have revenues, own IP, etc. That intrinsic value may be below their current valuation, maybe dar below in some cases, but  there is a floor and it's non zero. Keep in mind I said most, some companies are underwater and have more liabilities than assets or potential for revenue. For crypto the floor absolutely is zero. It holds the value we assign it and is backed by nothing else.",Steve-in-the-Trees,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/nj80v2/return_to_penny_stocks_imminent/gz7e6ek/,0.026,0.813,0.162,0.897
7,API, Man smart contracts are basically just API hooks to your crypto wallet. It’s cool but it’s hardly something that on its own will move mountains.,smhs1998,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/nj80v2/return_to_penny_stocks_imminent/gz6onmc/,0.0,0.868,0.132,0.3612
8,DD," MASSIVE dilution. So much that market cap is already at or above December 2019 pre-pandemic market cap. Looking at share price might seem like it will be good for a recovery play, but looking at market cap it is clear that it is already the SAME price as before given the dilution, with MUCH worse financials. How come dilution never gets mentioned on reddit DDs. I got in after some promising DD, but exited after I found out how abysmal their common stock dilution was, and it is still ongoing. No one doing their homework should see this as something else than a probable pumpndump.",davere78,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/niwjoi/no_position_dd_aht_put_it_on_the_ritz/gz48wwc/,0.061,0.817,0.122,0.6124
