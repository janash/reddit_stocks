429,USB," I equate Treasury bonds with cash.  
You can exchange them for cash.  
They make very little interest over time.  
It’s what banks use to get cash from the treasury when they need liquidity.

The Chinese government is one of the biggest holders of Treasury bonds.  
If Treasury bonds crash and the US government can no longer finance its’ massive debt then China will be left holding the bag.

So why put your money into Treasury bonds if they are tied to cash? (which the government can dilute by printing more of it)

Both political parties have shown themselves to be fiscally irresponsible.  The national debt will no longer be able to be financed at some future date.  My take is that we are over-leveraged from a national debt perspective.  

I should probably buy precious metals and crypto.  The advantage of crypto over precious metals is portability.  

You may not be able to carry large amounts of gold over international borders.  You would be able to carry a USB key or a Sim card with your crypto key.  

Worst case scenario is the US economy collapses and we can no longer finance our national debt.  

If you needed to go bug out and live in another country (because of US inflation, taxation, economic collapse, political unrest, whatever) to weather that storm, crypto would be really useful.  

… Assuming the US government won’t feel its sovereignty threatened by crypto … which it does since USD is tied to oil - petrodollar and some crypto will compete with USD as the international oil currency and outlaw it.

440,USA," This Jimz2018...

We've been in the same channel for 100yrs...just broke out to the top...the correction won't come until the Fed stops buying 
$120bn of bonds per month.  If the USA wants to hold onto reserve status, we can't devalue that USD forever.  So interest rates going to climb, valuations will go down.   How fast, how far, when that happens?   Henry Dean doesn't know.   Michael Burry doesn't know.

Every country on earth is devaluing during Covid...it's the only way the Fed gets away with it.  Eventually an economic winner of the Covid crisis emerges ..if it's China our pain will be the interest rate climb to stay relevent, and then the pain his the greater economy.  That doesn't start until the fed stops brrr...  

The setup we have today is the same as 1927-1929...if it plays out the same (which it probably won't) it could mean the same 90% off stock valuations and a 10yr depression to follow.  I believe history echoes, I don't believe anything was fixed from the 2008 crash, so yes I feel it will happen again.  Stock up  now...the party isn't over until the fed stop brr...don't play risky shit you can't lose, but don't miss out on the gains.

Even if debts are supposedly easier to pay under inflation, unless the balance of the debt is consistently going up, the decrease cost of goods actually means deflation makes it easier to pay off debts. 

It’s the corporate and business debt that suffers during deflation and with a fiscal monetary policy that favors this debt economy, that’s the real reason for fear of deflation.

I haven't done the math recently, but it's somewhere around a factor of 5x.  This makes the pre-covid price adjusted for all the dilution below $2 ($8 / 5).  With AMC now trading over $16, that's at least a factor of 8x ($16 / $2), making today's price of ~$16 the pre-covid equivalent of ~$130 ($16 * 8).

There are also other, albeit expensive competitors to vimeo that offer more website integration and analytics - such as vidyard, brightcove, etc.  For ecomm businesses that I've dealt with, they found that other video players and cloud services were preferable over vimeo because it integrated better with their shopping cart system and because of better analytics on the individual viewer.

If vimeo can figure that out and be cheaper then ill be convinced that they are the better service for business IMO.

853,USA," There aren’t many ways to cut lumber usage without switching to metal-framed construction, or entirely concrete block walls(I have no idea what these would cost in relation to current lumber prices). All the stuff you mentioned other than floors: brick, stucco, hardi siding, vinyl. Are all exterior finish products. You still need to have the bones of the house to install those things. You still need to sheathe your exterior walls to put up any kind of siding(real wood siding is almost never used in residential construction anymore. Vinyl is cheaper/easier). In a lot of markets, the walls are sheathed with OSB which is an engineered wood product made from lumber, like plywood in a sense, but cheaper. Now that it’s skyrocketed people have started using the less popular but still structurally-sound foam board for exterior wall sheathing. You need some extra bracing and still need osb/plywood in certain areas, but the majority of the sheathing can be foam board, which actually insulates better than OSB/plywood, so will be better for energy efficiency in the long run. People just don’t like it because they don’t want to imagine their house is “made of foam” even though it’s just exterior sheathing, and is still certified structurally safe by engineers.

Wood flooring was already becoming increasingly more and more unpopular because it was already expensive, and high maintenance. They’ve advanced the vinyl plank flooring products to the point that they are very durable, and look like real wood while being easier to maintain. And about the same cost as hardwood, maybe even a little cheaper now.
