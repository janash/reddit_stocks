0,DD," As a woman, I can tell you most of us are very wary of inserting random creams and ointments inside of ourselves. The effectiveness rate being what is is, the inconvenience of having to do it every round, and side effects which are almost guaranteed since I’d be messing with my pH balance mean any smart man interested in investing in this should do his DD by talking to his wife/gf/partner with a vagina about their thoughts first.",Emptymeatsuit,13,/r/pennystocks/comments/oinflp/evofem_the_only_nonhormonal_birth_control_pill/h4xipjn/,0.031,0.901,0.068,0.4404
1,DD," I think there's a future to this kind of product but not THIS product in particular.

Unless the product itself provides equal or better protection to a simple condom, I don't think it will take off as a non hormonal contraceptive.

The hormonal pill is used for slot more than just contraception, so this is not a replacement product for the pill. I therefore think that it looses most of its market as a result of this and the low efficacy.

Sure there will be a market for it but it's main competitors will be condoms, a product that is dirt cheap, easy to use and literally every one knows about. You mentioned the price of the product at 289$ per 60 grams but how many pills/uses is that? Will it be able to keep up with condoms?

This is from the planned Parenthood website:
>Condoms are sold in lots of different stores, and you can even get them for free from many health centers. Boxes of 3 cost about $2 to $6. Condoms usually cost less than $1 each if you buy packs of 12 or more.

> https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/condom/how-do-i-get-condoms

The next issue are the side effects. Sure, they're not the same ones as a hormonal pill but they sound like they can get pretty rough too. Especially considering they present a lower efficacy. Add to they that this product effects both partners and not just one also makes me think people will be less inclined to use it (personally I think that that's a pretty rough topic to discuss morally but that's not what this is about).

Overall therefore I don't think that this product will explode as much as your DD is making me believe you think it will, and the fact that you say they seem to have gone all in on this product makes me weary of the company and the business decisions they make. Going all in on any product is a bad idea for any company in my opinion.

The general direction of non hormonal contraception for women is a market that I think should be further investigated and worked for as I think the opening for such a product is there I just don't think that this one will be the one to do it.

But hey, that's just me. I'll definitely be keeping an eye on this and to be honest I hope I'm wrong! I wish you luck on your investment!",MSBGermany,9,/r/pennystocks/comments/oinflp/evofem_the_only_nonhormonal_birth_control_pill/h4wvwld/,0.05,0.835,0.115,0.9852

11,BC," Some do. It's also used to treat symptoms of endometriosis and ovarian cysts. And sometimes it works. But the side effects of hormonal BC are occasionally worse than the problems you are trying to fix - making it a less than ideal option.

12,BC," hormonal BC can and often is pretty bad for a lot of women. Acne, spotting/bleeding between periods, sore breasts, nausea, headaches, and a whole host of potential hormone imbalance issues are some of the most common side effects. Add to that the risks of serious complications. Blood clotting in particular is the most common, but a lot of people with a variety of diseases or conditions shouldn’t take it as well, including if you have, had, or are at higher risk of developing breast cancer, ovarian, cervical, uterine, or endometrial cancer, a variety of heart diseases and conditions, strokes, blood clots, high blood pressure, specific types of migraines, liver disease… I could go on but you get the point. There’s a lot of risks for a lot of women, and side effects are much more common than you’d think. There’s also not much research yet into it but it may very well have significant effects on pretty much any conditions relating to hormones and neurotransmitters. Think psychiatric disorders, autoimmune disorders, neurological disorders, and pretty much anything because of how interconnected hormones are. And lastly, I think a lot of people forget that BC are drugs just like any other you may take, and can interact with a variety of meds people may be otherwise taking. All in all, yes, women would love more alternatives to hormonal BC.

Also have a plan for every stock and what your TP is - once it hits it get out and don’t be greedy. I would probably have broken even by now if I was more disciplined with when I sold my holdings.

143,CTXR," I definitely don't see it as a sinking boat. Sure, it's lower than it was (and I know first hand how much it sucks to have bought at peak and then see the mega dip), but I look at that recent peak as optimism for the end of the Mino-Lok trial. I think that as the trial proceeds toward the 100% enrollment mark, more people and institutions will buy in. Not to mention gains CTXR will see from any news on Halo-Lido, which should be another big winner with a shorter timeline to market than Mino-Lok has had. This company's market cap should be well over $1B with either one of these products in market, which is nearly 4 times where it's at now.

I'd need to get into my account, which I can't do at the moment. But I believe my lowest priced position is $1.48 and my highest is that $3.80 with a few lots in between. My average is just above $2.20. Haven't sold a single share because I see this one as something that'll do fine in the next year or two (probably even in the next 3 to 6 months) but really grow in the next 5 years.

151,UPS," Interesting interpretation here… appreciate the work that went into this research but if I might make a few comments ?

1. This isn’t an MSO. It’s curious that you found this company out of all the American operators to focus in on. Trulieve , GTI, Curaleaf, Columbia Care, Verano, Ascend, Vireo ( Goodness Growth) and a few others out there are real MSO’s. The metric is now considered if more than 70% of revenue comes from 1 state , you aren’t really an MSO even if you happen to have operations of some kind in 2 states 

2. Most of the revenue comes from 1 dispensary in sub par location. It will be interesting to see what happens to sales here now that Cookies opened less than a mile from here in partnership with GTI.  Don’t know anything about the Oasis product itself but hopefully it can withstand the competition. It’s similar to a Starbucks opening up on the same street as a nice local coffee house. 

3. M&A… I don’t know.. too small to hit anyone’s radar. TGIFF looks setup for a buy with anyone looking for a Vegas operator. 

4. The management/ ownership  doesn’t seem to have any cannabis history whatsoever. Seems like a financial plaything for these guys. What’s their attachment to the plant? Not to mention the corporate HG is mailbox in a UPS store in Miami… not that anything is so bad about that, but it’s noteworthy. 

5. Share structure is weird. How will they expand without issuing a ton of new shares? They have no cash ??

I do appreciate you writing this. I’m invested heavily into MSO’s and I love the industry. Never heard of these guys and I follow things closely. But will be watching now.

152,CLS," CLS holdings may have a market cap around their net revenue, however they have approximately $20 million in convertible debentures due Dec 13, 2022 at a conversion price of C$0.30 per share. With their net debt of around -$1 million that gives them an Enterprise Value (EV) of approximately $42 million which is more relevant as multiples are measured as EV/Sales or EV/EBITDA not market cap. So they are still trading around 2x revenue which is still quite attractive when looking at comparables in the industry around the same size (for reference a comp of around 15 smaller US operators traded at an average of 3.4x EV/Sales). My biggest concern with CLS holdings is that despite a healthy enough gross margin they have not been able to achieve  positive EBITDA.

161,EVER," Shroom companies are focused on treating mental health issues with the use of psychedelic compounds and their derivatives. There are multiple companies that are in various stages of clinical studies. So far, there are promising results for various issues such as suicidal ideation, smoking cessation, ptsd, ssri resistant depression, etc. The market is there. Mental health is at the forefront of public attention rn with all the suicides and people coming out publicly about their struggles. This is the first time EVER that mental health is being treated in a similar fashion to physical health. 

I personally equate this to buying tech stocks at the beginning of the dot com boom. There will be people who are hesitant. But, all it takes is FDA approval of one compound for a company's share price to absolutely skyrocket. MMED has a pretty decent pipeline and I am personally bullish on it. I got in prior to uplisting, however.

NUMI is another company that has been granted approval by the Canadian Government to literally use these compounds to help treat patients in their clinics in Toronto and Vancouver. They are partnered with MAPS to administer the psychotherapy along with the compounds. The Canadian government seems to be very accepting of the idea. 

The science is there. The anecdotal evidence is there. The hype is there. It is definitely a bit of a binary decision. Do you think psychedelics will be successful in treating mental health issues that other medication has been terrible for? In my opinion, the legalization of weed has paved the way for much more fast-tracked legalization of other compounds - especially if they are being used for a medicinal purpose. 

There is a gap in the market for useful medication. SSRIs are literal garbage and come with a host of side effects. I have a background in psychology and remember even learning about the potential of psychedelics in school, back when things were a bit more theoretical.

This Sector has the potential to seriously improve the quality of life for so many people for so many issues. I truly believe that this Sector will be lifechanging. Not only for patients, but for those investors that got in before the first company is able to get FDA approval.
