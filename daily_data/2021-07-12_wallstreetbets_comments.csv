I like SPCE. I think it's a stock that pushes up based on hype, and if you buy at the right time, it's a good stock to own. It's also probably good for a long term hold (10+ years), but no one here cares about that, and there are better stocks to hold long term. But make no mistake, it's a meme stock right now.

Or is the better thing for the company, and original investors, is for them to be exercised so they collect an additional $11.50. I thought it was equal either way because the fractional share should compensate for the 11.50.

There's a part in your description that I can't make click. ""Then say they issue another 100 shares and sell them."" Sell them to who, for what(500mil, but at what price per share)?

Don't try to convince me I'm wrong. I've obviously done more research than you.

593,BB," Serious answer: because it flew from $8 to $20 on zero news to begin with. The spike happened right after some VIP guest on CNBC blurted out that he had some BB calls. That's it. Just a 10-second endorsement - that's all it took.

I strongly believe there were a lot more naked shorts than the official short interest at the time (7% IIRC) due to some shenanigans with the Canadian stock market. It spiked alllll the way up due to the resulting squeeze, and now it's slowly, ever so slowly making its way back... It'll be a $30 stonk by the end of 2023, but not right now - not unless something really interesting happens.

SPCE have worked to continuously improve those engines and their costs to get them to a good price point.

Then SOFI and Paysafe.

The fact that RIDE was above NAV for so long is a joke, considering all its troubles, but these companies are being overlooked.

779,SOFI," I think there are great, undervalued, spac companies. SOFI is not a bad company, but it was definitely pumped and dumped. A portion of it was the lock-up expiry however which exacerbated the situation.

Some companies i adore: Alight #1, and super super cheap It's literally below it's NAV price which is insane as it just merged with WPF and became public as ALIT on July 6th. Bill Foley is also going to be chairman, and it's already beating expectations pre-merger. Finally, it's FCF positive and net income positive without shareholder compensation in 2021. Do some research on the company here: [https://alight.com/getmedia/27229533-b737-4a42-8ba0-bbacfdb1ecd4/ALIGHT\_AD\_041221\_9AM\_FINAL.pdf](https://alight.com/getmedia/27229533-b737-4a42-8ba0-bbacfdb1ecd4/ALIGHT_AD_041221_9AM_FINAL.pdf)

There's also Qomplex, which is going to merge with Tailwind II and is SLIGHTLY below its NAV. It's a cybersecurity and insurance/reinsurance company, with strong growth and high gross profits: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1814215/000110465921082614/tm219025d10\_425.htm?\_\_hstc=185877878.289c8b5890f2ae516a5c94c79cb672ce.1623614068263.1626034211527.1626095691927.3&\_\_hssc=185877878.3.1626095691927&\_\_hsfp=322783829&hsCtaTracking=3e40f759-2460-4bbd-a6d4-393db771635b%7Ced1d2b39-403b-46e1-b296-9034075a3633](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1814215/000110465921082614/tm219025d10_425.htm?__hstc=185877878.289c8b5890f2ae516a5c94c79cb672ce.1623614068263.1626034211527.1626095691927.3&__hssc=185877878.3.1626095691927&__hsfp=322783829&hsCtaTracking=3e40f759-2460-4bbd-a6d4-393db771635b%7Ced1d2b39-403b-46e1-b296-9034075a3633)

Then there's System1 which is merging with Trebia (A Foley Company, and I think he'll be chairman or on the board need to recheck) which was just announced. You can see the investor presentation, but it's pretty good too, and the SPAC is trading below NAV, so at a discount.

Then SOFI and Paysafe.

The fact that RIDE was above NAV for so long is a joke, considering all its troubles, but these companies are being overlooked. At the end of the day, once a full years earnings will be reported, there'll be no difference between an IPO company and a SPAC company. Bet on the right horse, and the right jockey, and you can make strong money over a 1-2 year horizon (though Alight should be a great 6 month options play).

You do know retirement accounts are designed to be less risky as you near retirement, right? Someone who has accumulated 1m+ in their lifetime will gladly take 10-15% a year.

When you're younger the accounts are typically more aggressive. A lot of users here could benefit from this.

Likewise, that is why their assets under management do not exceed their market cap.

893,GDP," 10% annual inflation would probably be bearish.... but what if it was 20% or 50%?  People say it couldn't happen because USD is reverse currency, but what if that just means all the trillions and trillions dollars held abroad flow back looking for something to buy if shit gets really out of control? Keep in mind there were warnings of bad corporate debts, broken price discovery and so on *before* COVID hit and ""Federal"" ""Reverse"" increased the money supply by something like 30% and the Federal government borrowed trillions of dollars for stimulus, giving us literally the highest relative deficit ever (higher than WW2 for fuck's sake) and highest historical US debt to GDP ratio.

Keep in mind there are entrenched, powerful interests (basically the Federal government) that could like to effectively inflate government debt away. There are also entrenched, powerful interests (banks, Chinese government) that don't want to lose via inflation to the loans they have made or will make.

As I see it we either gotta have assets correct hard with either deflation or moderate inflation or they are going to try to brrrrrrr their way out of this to keep the system moving for a while.

Branson going to fly? up 20% after hours, finishes next day up only 4%.  Flight imminent? Run up 20% on Thursday then dumps on Fri and Mon.  The dump on Friday was smart money selling their position b/c they knew this stock was only headed down.  I tried to post about it and encourage people to do the same but I got auto mod'd.
