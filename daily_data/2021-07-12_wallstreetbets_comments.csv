Don't try to convince me I'm wrong. I've obviously done more research than you.

593,BB," Serious answer: because it flew from $8 to $20 on zero news to begin with. The spike happened right after some VIP guest on CNBC blurted out that he had some BB calls. That's it. Just a 10-second endorsement - that's all it took.

I strongly believe there were a lot more naked shorts than the official short interest at the time (7% IIRC) due to some shenanigans with the Canadian stock market. It spiked alllll the way up due to the resulting squeeze, and now it's slowly, ever so slowly making its way back... It'll be a $30 stonk by the end of 2023, but not right now - not unless something really interesting happens.

Then there's System1 which is merging with Trebia (A Foley Company, and I think he'll be chairman or on the board need to recheck) which was just announced. You can see the investor presentation, but it's pretty good too, and the SPAC is trading below NAV, so at a discount.

Then SOFI and Paysafe.

779,SOFI," I think there are great, undervalued, spac companies. SOFI is not a bad company, but it was definitely pumped and dumped. A portion of it was the lock-up expiry however which exacerbated the situation.

You do know retirement accounts are designed to be less risky as you near retirement, right? Someone who has accumulated 1m+ in their lifetime will gladly take 10-15% a year.

When you're younger the accounts are typically more aggressive. A lot of users here could benefit from this.

1. Be a boomer with 70% of your account (DCA, all the other lame shit), be aggressive with 10% (risky unpredictable but promising companies), meme trade with 10% (anything here), gamble with 10% (options or allocate this to more memes with DD that needs a TL;DR to still not make sense).

People say it couldn't happen because USD is reverse currency, but what if that just means all the trillions and trillions dollars held abroad flow back looking for something to buy if shit gets really out of control? Keep in mind there were warnings of bad corporate debts, broken price discovery and so on *before* COVID hit and ""Federal"" ""Reverse"" increased the money supply by something like 30% and the Federal government borrowed trillions of dollars for stimulus, giving us literally the highest relative deficit ever (higher than WW2 for fuck's sake) and highest historical US debt to GDP ratio.

Keep in mind there are entrenched, powerful interests (basically the Federal government) that could like to effectively inflate government debt away. There are also entrenched, powerful interests (banks, Chinese government) that don't want to lose via inflation to the loans they have made or will make.

As I see it we either gotta have assets correct hard with either deflation or moderate inflation or they are going to try to brrrrrrr their way out of this to keep the system moving for a while.
