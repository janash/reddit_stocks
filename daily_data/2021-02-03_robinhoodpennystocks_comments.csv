152,ATOS," Cancer isn’t a single, set disease, it is a multitude of conditions that require specific markers and treatments.

Although I do agree with your sentiments, I still believe both products being released by ATOS to be crucial. I see this easily as a $5 stock (not advice) but I think your skepticism is healthy. Still, this company is know to have no debt (according to many commentators) and is offering two great products.

Like I get it, GME has real problems but why do we have a system that empowers and encourages random opportunists to kick them (and their employees and municipalities that benefit from the tax revenue they generate) while they're down with 140% shorts?

Likewise, small cap biotechs doing amazing, bleeding edge things get panned by professional ""analysts"" who have neither the technical background nor the desire to understand what the company actually does, what it means for the field, etc.

181,SNDL," I agree that now is the time to BUY BUY BUY! 

SNDL is going 🚀🚀🚀🚀🌝 

The drop on 2/2/2021 was due to an offering to raise capital.  

Everyone tossed shade on the recent rise and blamed WSB and redditors but they're not looking at the potential flood gates for a meteoric rise. 

With the US Senate Finance Cmte Chair advancing a framework based on the House's passed December bill, we could potentially see national level legalization before the summer hits. 

House decriminalized MJ in December but there was not enough support in the senate to bring the bill forward and it was shelved to avoid it getting killed by republicana. With the run off completed and the 2 Dem senators installed along with Kamala acting as the tie breaker, they could easily shove MJ legalization down everyone's throat.

https://www.marijuanamoment.net/key-senate-chairman-previews-plan-to-advance-federal-marijuana-legalization-this-session/


Also keep in mind that the pressures at work -- $$$$$$ States with legalized MJ or recreational laws saw extra padding in their budgets when CV 19 killed their economies. MJ created the surplus funds for NV that Sisolak burned through by the summer of 2020. Many states are also working OT to legalize recreational use as their peer states to reap economic benefits too. 

SNDL is well positioned and now with extra funds from their latest stock offering, well-abled to take advantage of the law changes.",thebrokeguy2021,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lbc0i9/50k_shares_of_sndl_corporate_video_in_comments/glu1q4h/,0.1,0.837,0.063,-0.9028

347,OCGN," $OCGN Ocugen is to commercialize COVID vaccine COVAXIN™ in the US Market

Ocugen recent market cap is 0.5 billion which is a joke, should be at least 3 times more. Moderna market cap is 62 Billion. it gained more than 30 Billion since its vaccine news. OCGN current total market cap is only about 0.5 billion. A lot of upside for OCGN

Large demand form US government will fuel OCGN. it will also likely be the only vaccine safe for ppl under 18. Think about how the government will get the kids back to school?

Once the preliminary efficacy data is released (likely in mid Feb), OCGN will prob hit $10. Phase 3 study is going to be completed in March. Once Covaxin is approved, OCGN is likely to hit $50-$80.  I'm long OCGN and expect a quick 20-30X upside from current price

You get 100 shares of ATOS at $2.5, so your profit will be $3.5-$2.5= $1X100 shares= $100. You lose the premium you pay to buy the options. So, it's cheaper to sell the option than exercise it.

504,DD," I dabbled with them in the past and do plan to buy back in.  My take / two cents...

They're a good LONG term buy.  I could see the share price rising significantly over the coming years, but I don't believe you'll see any rockets short term.  And that's why I got out fairly recently... felt I could better allocate my funds short term.  But again... I do plan to get back in while they're under a dollar.

That said, I haven't done any recent DD... so I may be missing something.",WhirlwindDragon,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lbmdk8/denison_mines_dnn/gluxiee/,0.036,0.879,0.084,0.4947

Financials haven't been great but their quarterly losses are at or above forecasts.  Last year, production of Uranium was reduced, which helped the price increase.  Analysts, (morningstar) appear bullish on long-term global uranium demand.  I have a small (long) holding of 100 @.72.

508,AMC," I don't usually day trade them. Sometimes it can take a couple if weeks but i usually find 20%+ gains with this. As for selling I set a price target slightly below previous highs (resistance). If you can't watch the ticker all the time just set a limit sell & make tendies without even paying attention. You risk leaving money on the table this way, it could break through to higher resistances but regardless you wont be holding the bag.

MUX appeared on my screener at the same time as AMC, would have been a good play but there were bigger fish to fry. If you take a look there I found it at $0.92 you can see previous highs at 1.17 & 1.36. It broke both but bounced at the heavier resistance of $1.46.

Heres a snapshot of AMC when it appeared on the screener (I had to take a picture because its textbook for what I'm looking for in the screener charts, picking up volume & rebounding from a rock bottom price). You can see previous highs just above $4. On a normal play I would be looking for $4/share. AMC wasn't a normal tho.

I also know there are still Many out there that don’t where to put there money.. but gambling habit dies hard for some.. so I’m almost willing to bet they will see my buddies here soon enough and do another blind dive.. not preying on anyone, nor advising pump and dumps.. but I have to invest and go with what my gut tells me as others should also for what theirs tell them.

After researching the company, looking over financials etc.. then I invest wisely based on what I feel..

My other personal chosen safer play for dividends is AT&T.. they trade sideways and pay out a nice dividend quarterly..

I also placed a two year long call on my buddies there at OGI showing me some promise.. pennies on the dollar.. if they hit, in all up in the money, but if they loose.. two years from now I will be out all of $80..
