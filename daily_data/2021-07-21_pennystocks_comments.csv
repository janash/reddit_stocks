They're all mining in the BC Golden Triangle. So I said eff it and spread my dough amongst all 4.

Since then they've all lost some value yet they're all penny stocks so some even at 100 shares maybe lost me $4 lol

4,ATOS," How closely did you look??

Did you read ATOS or Atossa? Glassdoor shows 11 reviews for Atossa Genetics and over 2,000 for Atos , NEITHER of which is ATOS Therapeutics. The Atossa Genetics were from years ago. Are you trying to bash ATOS?

I googled ATOS review and as I read Glassdoor I realized that it was for a tech company. I then googled Atossa Terapeutics and there was only Atossa Genetics with 11 reviews. I'm not a subscriber so the only reviews I couls see were from 2016 and 2013.",MagnificentToad,10,/r/pennystocks/comments/ootfpi/protip_search_company_name_reviews_before_buying/h60w53b/,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

6,RUN," I’ll add this; I’ve seen public companies have their managers supervise entry level workers as they leave positive reviews on Glassdoor lol.  Often, the negative reviews I’ve seen absolutely have grounds in reality.  You get a few salty reviews of course, but if there are bad reviews & high turnover, RUN lol.  Especially if the good reviews aren’t in-depth enough; if they are surface level it means they were coerced.  Seent it.

By the way; two of the companies I have seen that were the most toxic and horrible and low key ordered employees to leave Glassdoor reviews, they are listed on “best places to work” lists at city and state level and they brag about it all day every day lol.",WeReallyOutHere420,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/ootfpi/protip_search_company_name_reviews_before_buying/h61vpnr/,0.143,0.746,0.111,-0.5719
7,ATOS," You're right, they are both sort of bad, ATOS genetics being worse than ATOS therapeutics, however they are both around 2.5 - 3.5 score out of 5 which is not ideal for a smaller company. You also cannot find any reviews on ATOS products which to me is a red flag as well because it suggests that it is mostly a speculative stock..

8,ATOS," I think that you are missing the point.

ATOS on Greendoor is a tech co. in Los Angeles. Atossa Therapeutics is in Seattle, Washington. A clue would be the mention of Atos being affiliated with Disney. Atossa Genetics became Atossa Therapeutics when they changed their focus which might have resulted in people losing jobs and bad feelings.

There aren't any products to review because they are ""a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company seeking to discover and develop innovative medicines in areas of significant unmet medical need with a current focus on breast cancer and COVID-19"" Yes it is a speculative stock but a few minutes of research would reveal the CEO is Stephen C.Quay, M.D ,Ph.D. ""Dr. Quay is a named inventor on 87 U.S. patents, 130 pending U.S. patent applications, and is named inventor on patents covering five pharmaceutical products that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.""

Perhaps some initial research into the company would help you understand the reviews better. You create doubt by casual mentions like this without proper research despite possible good intentions. It's also important to remember that people are more likely to post reviews when they are unhappy.

And yes, penny stocks are speculative which is why you should be looking into the leadership and understanding that many don't currently have earnings or even products.",MagnificentToad,13,/r/pennystocks/comments/ootfpi/protip_search_company_name_reviews_before_buying/h61h8k7/,0.074,0.793,0.133,0.9107
9,HR," I literally admit that I see racism.  But I am nuanced enough to also see a pattern of structural support for POC in public companies, and you don’t even have to take my word for it.  You can ask literally anyone who has worked in recruiting for public companies.  HR will literally beg you for black candidates, for good jobs. (It’s illegal for them to ask for candidates based on race but they are so desperate they do it anyways). Especially women.  These are jobs a white person wouldn’t even be considered for.  Then I have worked in public companies and I have seen first-hand peers that underperform and get a pass; and peers that underperform and get ROCKETED out of the company.  Usually, the most disposable people, are white.  Because they are easily replaced with the skills necessary for that job for almost all skilled jobs in public companies.",WeReallyOutHere420,0,/r/pennystocks/comments/ootfpi/protip_search_company_name_reviews_before_buying/h61xdgf/,0.072,0.853,0.075,-0.1373
