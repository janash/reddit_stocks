**The speculative rocket:**

l This stock moves on a few 100 share buys. With upcoming catalysts, crypto hype, and current short interest, this will moon.

**Price expectations:**

$3 post Q1 (Q1 is next month)

$6 summer

$10 EOY

**Price target:**

Double digits on NASDAQ. If ISHW continues taking all the right steps as they have been, they might be worth adding to my retirement portfolio. MARA and RIOT currently around $30 with analyst targets $50-$60+ and both were single digits last year, so it can be done.",found_the_remote,9,/r/pennystocks/comments/my7l0l/iswh_your_sunday_research_done/gvta1zf/,0.072,0.875,0.053,-0.7148

For those interested in the technicals -
Took out a 25k loan online on Friday - 
First thing Monday morning I pumped it into Rambler Mining and Metals
£RMM on the London Stock Exchange
(RMM.L)

In the UK you can invest in stocks and shares tax free via an ISA (Individual Savings Account)  - allowance is 20k annually
If I've understood the comparison correctly it's similar to the US Roth IRA investment account

So - I loaded this up with the full 20k on Rambler. (I use freetrade - UK equivalent to Robinhood), I also put £2.5k in via their GIA (General Investment Account), free but you currently pay tax on annual gains over £12,300 - I'm anticipating geting out somewhere around 5x, depending on the situation, so shouldn't be badly affected, plus this also acts as a quick, simple way to keep track of gains purely from the Rambler YOLO, as I've nothing else invested in the GIA and I had a previous purchase of Rambler of £4,800 in the ISA at 0.38 in February.
I've kept the remaining 2.5k in reserve to pay for the first 5 months of loan repayments - (Roughly £540/month)

If people like I may post a weekly update on the Gains / Losses

Financial Times previously estimated it will 10x to 3.6p within 12 months 
https://markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/forecasts?s=RMM:LSE

Though this was prior to the recent surge in Copper prices and I anticipate this could be more

After research, I'm hopeful this will go how I'm planning -  Rambler is a producing mine, which, with newly added and proven management recently installed, is starting to ramp up production in previously discovered  high yield deposits. Mine life guaranteed for next 20 years.

24,CD," Ok, first and most important thing is that if you haven't sold anything you owe no taxes, yet. It doesn't matter how far up your investment has gone unless you've sold.

Once you sell, you're going to owe on any profits made. Whatever year you sell in is the year taxes are due. Assuming you're on a calendar year for taxes (which you will be if you've never been told otherwise), that means anything you sell from Jan 1 - Dec 31 has taxes due on the profits in April of the next year (if US, and depending on extensions). That means you could owe the taxes anywhere from 3 to 15 months after you sell.

Now, the second important thing to realize is that if you have both gains and losses, you can subtract the losses from your gains so you owe less (i.e. if you make $2,000 on one stock, but lose $1,000 on another you only owe taxes on the $1,000 net profits).

As for how to manage profits so you have the cash to pay taxes, you could put it in a separate bank account until tax day, but you can lose out on up to a year of trading depending on when you sell (remember, taxes are due up to 15 months later). What most people will do is reinvest their profits so they can make more money throughout the year instead of having that money sitting in a bank doing nothing.

But here is the important part: If you reinvest profits, make 100% sure you sell enough again by December to pay the taxes! If you leave the tax money in the market and the market crashes on Jan 1, you could be left without enough value in your stocks to meet your tax bill! If the market crashes in December, your losses from selling then will balance out your gains from earlier in the year and erase the debt - but they *must* be in the same year!

Once you sell in December, **do not reinvest that money until taxes are paid**.  You can put it in a CD instead of a bank account so you at least make a percent or two, but until thise taxes are paid you do not want to put them into anything that could go down.

Side note: If your investments are in an IRA, you will not owe any taxes on profits until you take them out of the account. If it's a Roth IRA, you'll never owe any taxes on profits at all. For this reason, if you're investing for retirement you should be taking advantage of IRAs - but make sure you know how they work before you invest with them since there's specific rules you need to follow to put money in or take money out.",Pope_Cerebus,51,/r/pennystocks/comments/my9gf9/quick_question_about_taxes/gvu1vwe/,0.057,0.852,0.092,0.9619
25,AGI," What you pay taxes on: 

gains. Ie: buy 1 share @ $100, sell 1 share @ $150. Pay taxes on $50.

Tax rates are largely dependent on AGI (annual gross income) and the types of income. Ie: short term/long term capital gains, dividends qualified/unqualified, reits etc, as well as where you’re located for state taxes.

42,IRS," I'm assuming you're American. First thing's first, visit the [IRS website](https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free) because they have a bunch of free-file options where you only have to pay if you make a lot (relatively, for us penny fools) of money. There's a bunch of services there.

Second, make sure your broker does electronic 1040s and 1099s (the forms you need for trades and investments). All the major brokers do this (i.e. your Schwabs, your Fidelities, TD, etc.) so it's not a huge deal, but some might be bastards.

Third, some of the freefile options on the IRS website allow you to connect directly with your broker and upload all the necessary forms without you needing to do anything besides grant access to login. I personally used TurboTax. Even if they're a piece of shit company that continually lobbies to keep the tax code as complex as it is, their website program is easy to use.

Beyond that, there's nothing much else to do. It's pretty simple, and only if you make over ~25k net you actually have to pay taxes, otherwise you get a standard refund.",UncleMomsCabin,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/mxxuqb/wherehow_should_i_do_my_taxes/gvt7wys/,0.075,0.846,0.078,0.1499
