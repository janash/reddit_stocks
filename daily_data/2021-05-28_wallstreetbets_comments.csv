29,AMC," > AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. capped its best trading session in four months, pushed higher by eager retail investors who celebrated vaulting the company’s market value to a record $13 billion on social media.
> 
> Shares soared 36% to $26.52 as 691 million shares changed hands, in the busiest day since January for the Leawood, Kansas-based company. The four-day rally more than doubled its stock price, pushing its year-to-date gains to 1,150%.
> 
> AMC’s revival has been fueled by individual investors eager to save the movie theater industry after it raised more than $1 billion in financing to avoid bankruptcy over recent months.
> 
> Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron has embraced the Reddit-fueled rally and talked to new retail investors on conference calls. The stock has roughly tripled since AMC reported quarterly results on May 6, adding $9 billion in value. Thursday’s milestone stands out against a market value bottom of $216.8 million which was hit in April 2020.
> 
> AMC Entertainment's market value has soared to a record amid retail mania
> While Chad Beynon, an analyst with Macquarie Securities, is waiting for AMC to continue to shed debt and lease obligations before getting more constructive on shares, he acknowledged the mania individual investors can create.
> 
> “The Reddit crowd is strong, the volumes have been off the charts lately, so there’s clearly demand that wasn’t there pre-Covid,” he said by phone. The company’s ability to raise cash at over $10 a share earlier in the month “marked the first time the company was able to financially benefit from the Reddit rally,” he said.
> 
> The cash AMC has raised through the sales of hundreds of millions of additional shares is a key driver for the massive run-up in market value despite the stock actually trading down more than 25% from a 2015 peak. More than 490 million shares of AMC are currently available for trading, data compiled by Bloomberg show, almost ten-times the 52 million shares outstanding at the start of last year.
> 
> Number of AMC Entertainment shares has soared as the theater raised cash
> More Capital
> Debt tied to AMC has rallied alongside shares, setting new highs in recent days. The company’s bonds, which were trading at a low of 5 cents in November, are inching close to par, according to Trace trading data. That debt carries a hefty coupon of 12% for the notes due 2026.
> 
> AMC’s bonds were among the top performers in the U.S. high-yield market on Thursday, extending gains from earlier in the week.
> 
> The company said previously it might seek more financing, and some investors have suggested it sell more shares to pay down or look to refinance its more than $10 billion debt load.
> 
> The cinema chain “will carefully examine the raising of additional capital in whatever form we think is most attractive” and is focused on de-leveraging, Aron said on a call to discuss fourth-quarter results in March.
> 
> AMC's bonds reach record high amid Reddit rally
> The company’s latest resurgence at the hands of individual investors has pushed the market value to more than double its April 2017 peak of $4.17 billion prior to this year’s trading. Put a different way, AMC has consistently added more than $1 billion in each of the last three sessions -- more than double its value at the start of the year.
> 
> Mark-to-market losses for investors betting against the movie theater chain topped $1 billion this week alone, data compiled by S3 Partners shows.
> 
> The movie theater company’s ability to post strong box office numbers as it reopens in key markets like New York and California will be important, B. Riley Securities analyst Eric Wold said by phone.

77,RH," Yes, they waived the requirements but each broker had discretion. RH and other brokers have a legal out so don't expect much. How they handled their internal risk was initiated by the DTC increasing collateral requirements.

The DTC is in cahoots with these guys. They've been accused of allowing naked shorting for a very long time. They only acted in self preservation. If the brokers go tits up, their banks, clearing house, and lastly the DTC are on the hook.

It wouldn't surprise me if decades down the line, we get the truth that some billionaire called in a favor at the DTC to orchestrate the halting of retail buying pressure.

It's unprecedented that buying stocks with cash were halted for retail. While we were locked out, HFs got to reposition and or make profits.

Separately, these crooks dropped the stock price by 77% with 8 million volume. There is material damage done to retail.

We got fucked in the ass without dinner or lube.

383,BB," I don't know anything other than what is publicly available to anyone. Despite wild swings that can take place in a share price, in the end the fundamentals win the day. In the early days it is more subjective. Financial analysts work for IBs and not for the actual company they are researching. Yes sometimes both the company in question (like BB) and the IB are on the same side of the table BUT sometimes they are not. Financial analysts are not motivated to make bold calls or be subjective. They may eventually show up but usually much later, at which point the share price has likely appreciated quite a bit. They generally look for certainty. But one does not have to wait for the money to be on the books to know it’s coming. To make this point, 10 years ago FB had a user base of 50 million and NO revenues. Yet MSFT invested $246 million for a tiny stake valuing FB at $15 billion. This is not a crazy analogy becasue QNX has a user base of over 175 million. And IVY will have the ability to tap that. BB also has revenues. Using $15 billion equates to about $27 USD per share for BB. What if we used 175 million ? At the time many thought MSFT was crazy but today that $246 million would be worth $20 billion or 75x more. You suggest no financial analysts have a buy rating (most are SELL/HOLD). If this is the case, you can ask yourself, or the institutions in question, why are 50% plus of the BB shares held by institutions. Many of these are considered world class and very savvy. Allianz hold almost a quarter of a $ billion in shares when no analysts are recommending BB ? Why ?

387,BB, Well I think we could see it spike to $ 50 and then settle by mid June to the 30's which is where it belongs. I do love it when users say they don't know about this price by EOY when literally there are a ton of stocks who definitely don't deserve the levels they're at but are. I honestly believe that not rebranding BB with a new name is a bad idea. I think when the new CEO comes in soon that they'll do it. Chen has had his run ( since 2013 ) but it's time for him to retire ( he's going to be 65 soon ) and they need to find someone young fresh and more energetic to run the company. If he wants to make his bonus compensation by putting the stock over $ 40 USD he best move faster. BB is a long play but it should pay off especially with their QNX tech and the future of electric and self driving vehicles.

505,TD," There are others in this comment section that have touched on it, but I’ll give it a go here for kicks.

Calls are basically contracts that allow someone to buy 100 shares of a stock per 1 contract after the stock reaches a strike price.

So if you see 20C, that means it’s a call with a strike price of 20.  If the market value of the stock is over 20 by expiration, you can exercise the contract and buy the 100 shares at the price of 20 apiece.  

However, there’s a premium you’ll have paid for the right to do this; let’s say it’s .59.  That means you pay .59 per share in the contract (so .59*100=59) and that’s your cost to buy the call up front, is 59.  This means the stock value needs to hit 20.59 for you to come out even from exercising the call option.  After that, you would make whatever the price is -20.59= Your total profit.

Puts are the opposite: you buy a contract that allows you to sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price. So 17P would be a put that gives you the right to sell a stock for 17 if it happens to go below that price.  Again, it has to go lower than 17-(your premium you paid) for you to make money exercising it.

Keep in mind, you don’t have to wait and try exercise it.  You can keep an eye on what your contract premiums are for that type of contract, and if it goes up in value, you can sell the contract you bought to someone else for a bigger premium than what you paid for it.  This is how a lot of people make their money on options, not from actually exercising them.

Also keep in mind that the options, if they expire without reaching the strike price in either direction, become worthless.  It’s more of a gamble than straight up stocks.

I’m thinking you can figure out what you’re hoping the stock will do depending on which one you bought (and conversely, which one you sell, if you’re offering the option initially, where you’re the one that’s allowing someone to buy 100 shares at a price or sell their 100 shares to you at a certain price).

TD you’ll probably want to visit the good old Google to see where their options buying and selling are.  Options require a decent amount of investment into learning them and how to buy and sell them, so it seems like it would be doing you a disservice just handing you all the info on how to get that set up so that you end up falling into it without really knowing anything about them.",-1KingKRool-,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nmyjtu/i_invested_1k_on_monday_on_some_calls_and_this_is/gzrqk7c/,0.036,0.853,0.111,0.9888

In this case, it seems AMC could go to $1 and it wouldn't matter, he would still only lose the 1K.  Is that correct?

2. That it can't fall any lower than it is at the moment. There's too much interest and meme value in the stock now, if it did fall lower it would get flooded with buys and apes to try and catch the next big mene stock.

1219,PLTR," I don't know the details with Alex Karp, but for those trying to understand the tax treatment here, what the author is saying is he received nonstatutory stock options.

Tax-wise, when the option is exercised (i.e. he buys the shares) he has regular ordinary income on the difference between the current share price and the strike price. For example if the strike is $10 and the stock price is $22 he has income on 22-10=12.

Two things to keep in mind... One, he has to come up with the $10 per share, which he can simply get via selling enough shares to cover the $10 cost and two, he needs enough money to pay tax on the $12 income, which may force him to sell another large chunk of those shares.

If his plan is to hold the shares, then to the extent he does not need funds to cover the strike price it is beneficial for him for the share price to be lower as his tax burden is less. BUT, as he needs money to cover that strike, obviously a higher price might be better.

Going back to my example above, if he exercised 100 shares worth, he would need $1,000 to cover the strike, which at $22 per share would be about 45 shares. In addition to cover taxes (assuming 40% x $1,200 = $480) he would need to sell another 22 shares, leaving him with 33 shares net. If the share price instead was $15, then he would need to sell 67 shares to cover the strike and the tax (40% x $500 = $200) would need another 13 shares, netting him with 20 shares. Bottom line, he benefits from the stock price being up if he needs to cover the strike price.

This is all forced activity as the alternative may be to lose the money.

Not sure how my explanation plays into your thesis but it is what it is.

1273,AI," Also you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is.

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",sublette313,27,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nmlb2d/palantir_options_dirt_cheap/gzpsmih/,0.086,0.778,0.136,0.9974
1274,ALL," Also you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit.

The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s.

1278,NSC," Also you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be.

He keeps telling his wife he knows what he’s doing- *”the kids will never go hungry again after they’re sitting on a mountain of tendies!”*.. she just doesn’t understand.

1506,GME," This is the underlying principle behind maximum pain theory. I've got a spreadsheet going for GME to estimate how many shares are likely going to be unwound tomorrow. It's currently around 3 million. They will get sold off as time passes (charm), if the price drops (delta), or as people take profit on their ITM calls (if they sell the call back to the MM, the MM then sells the hedged shares). It'll be a tug of war between MM's unhedging, paperhands, and dip buyers to see what happens. I'm personally betting on unhedging and paperhands, which is probably not welcome here.",Squatomatic,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nmq05j/genuine_amc_question_related_to_any_short_squeeze/gzq90wb/,0.089,0.864,0.047,-0.6788
1507,AMC," I don't know dude. I just know that based on the tables AMC has about 28m shares held to hedge options. It's just a latent selling pressure that will impact the situation. 28m out of 700m of volume may not be much, but you'd have to factor it relative to the number of people who bought new shares and weren't day trading and we can't know what that volume was. If unhedging causes a dip and people decide to sell and get out, that'll be the real cause of the drop.

Edit: my numbers were only counting 5/28 options. Once you add in the next 3 expirations (oi drops off after that) it's more like 70m shares. And we can expect about 3-4m shares to unwind per dollar drop in price.",Squatomatic,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nmq05j/genuine_amc_question_related_to_any_short_squeeze/gzqbz9j/,0.05,0.841,0.109,0.8042

I don't have a good way of pulling the data live so I've just been having to hand enter it into an excel sheet to calculate. Best guess right now will be 3-4m shares per dollar drop in price (plus whatever calls get sold). I think the downward pressure from unwinding will just be the primer that triggers the retail selloff.

1509,GME," People see GME going up, they buy calls and shares. Susquehanna (who is probably on the other side) then buys shares equal to the call delta to hedge the position. When the price goes up from these buys, it pushes up the deltas requiring more hedge shares, which feeds back on itself until the options are hedged and the MM is delta neutral. They also combine shares with other options (bought from yet other MM's) to gamma hedge, which they are probably doing a better job of this time around which is why the spike was smaller than January.",Squatomatic,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nmq05j/genuine_amc_question_related_to_any_short_squeeze/gzq7u9h/,0.0,0.888,0.112,0.8658

1538,DD," Biden mentioned them as the next vaccine to get approval. Manufacturing wise they will be producing just as much as Pfizer and more than moderna. Take a look on stocktwits for more DD. AY888 is great resource on Stocktwits. They are going to be one of the largest players in the covid space. Everyone in the biotech community knows of them and they're very well known. They will be providing 1.1 billion doses to Covax, an international effort to get vaccines across the world to mid to low income countries. Along with that they have a lot of contracts with higher end countries and a contract with the EU is expected for 200 million doses. Right now their market cap is going to be what their revenue is going to be next year. So at a minimum of 4X but I expect 7x without a problem personally due to the unique nature of their product having the strongest antibodies and variant protection.",johnnyknowbest,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nmuzzi/nvax_dd_low_float_hight_short_ratio_7x_future/gzqvj77/,0.009,0.9,0.091,0.9106
1539,DD," Yes CEO said they will be filing early Q3, being July. That's what I originally mentioned in the first sentence of my DD. (Just to clarify) That's a lil over a month away. In about 1 to 2 weeks US/Mexico P3 results are coming out. There's a lot of other catalysts such as EU approval for 200 million vaccines coming. The EMA (European FDA) is briefing today at 9am EST, but not sure if deal will be announced today. There's a steady stream of catalysts coming, institutions bought and brought up the ownership to 70% in last 3 weeks. A lot going on for this stock. 

Approval getting pushed back 6 weeks is not a big deal, as theres too much demand for the next 4 years for covid vaccines. A lot of people think this is a race but it's really a race to do it right so sometimes taking your time and setting up manufacturing the right way and doing trials the right way will get you passed the competition. And to top it off all the approved vaccines right now couldn't even vaccinate the world due to short supplies and too much demand. A lot of people want to think about the US demand is done because the US got at least 50% of people with one shot. The fact is most of the profits are going to be overseas.  The US makes a very small portion of the revenue. With only 5% of the world being vaccinated there isn't enough vaccines in the next year to cover the world we're going to need a lot more than just nvax. So they will be selling at max manufacturing capacity for the next 4 years. Either way they're still producing vaccines as we speak versus Pfizer and moderna that started producing after they got approval and it took them awhile to get stockpile a ready before they could give out vaccines. So regardless, time-wise it's going to be basically the same in that regard because their stockpiling before approval so when approval comes they can hit the ground running versus when their competitors got approved they start to stumbling out the gate with manufacturing.

Also last tidbit they can be stored at regular temperatures unlike mRNA type vaccines. One of the reasons why 1.1 billion doses of noavax will be delivered to Mid to low income countries because they can't afford crazy freezers for Pfizer and Moderna.

1540,AMC," As far as approval we have the best covid vaccine data in the world to date! Better then Pfizer, Moderna JnJ etc. Not only that we have the most comprehensive data they took the time to get the most diverse population which made the trials tougher to show a good result, and still we had the best result vs our competition. The competition just breezed through their trials and brought in a bunch of white people to make it easy. For example we did a phase 2 trial in Africa with Africans and HIV positive Africans, nobody else wanted to do that because they're afraid of bringing their results down. But this is how you build comprehensive data and that's how you get approvals all around the world. This is why it took them a little bit longer to get across the finish line, but for all the right reasons it took longer and will benefit shareholders exponentially more in the future due to that. Because of the diversity of the trials the data is gold, Biden is teaming up with South Korea to send 4 billion dollars worth of Nvax overseas to low-income countries as well. So if the president say that NVAX is coming out.... it's not a matter of if, but a matter of when. The vaccine is very much needed right now so there's a big push to get it out there as soon as possible but also launch with manufacturing ducks all in a row unlike Johnson & Johnson who had manufacturing hiccups; that's why we're taking our time to make sure everything's perfect and we don't disappoint our customers like AstraZeneca disappointed the European Union and now they're getting sued and not getting any more orders.

As far as Viotility goes...it was connected to overall markets. We hit 330 last time we reported data, the same week GME took off. When the markets took a big dip late February and in March we followed just like gme so we went down with the market. Then the CEO was kind of quiet while they were getting manufacturing worked out and we got hit with a lot of shorts like GME or AMC. In the last couple weeks manufacturing has been all sorted out. The FDA has been in communication with us and basically all the ""t's and i's"" have been crossed and dotted. We are about to hand in our FDA submission for approval any week with the anticipation of July approval...or very close to it.

Whenever a biotech is pre-revenue the share price is all over the place. We are finally entering the stage of revenue. Went from being in the negative in 2019 to having two billion dollars in our balance sheet from deposits on purchase orders. So now we have orders finalized, manufacturing finalized. And Governments.... not companies, but governments sending us millions and billions dollars worth of orders that are locked and loaded and some already negotiating for years ahead.

During the last earnings call the CEO said it was just going to be another couple months until approval and everybody got their panties up in a bunch and thought approval was going to be within a couple weeks so there was a sell-off. But there's no reason for a giant sell-off when approval is coming weeks down the road, people just aren't patient these days. That being said we're supposed to start getting approvals from different countries in July. 

All in all this is the moment in time where the volatility will start getting a little bit better and we should be over 250 without a problem as a support.

1543,UK, It all depends how long it takes put together the package it's a lot of paperwork and they are simultaneously doing it with multiple countries around the world at the same time every country is a different regulatory agency that follows by different rules so it's no easy task obviously they're pushing for us approval but things like getting the UK approval would open up the doors also the other approvals. July has been the most common time frame talked about within the investor community on stocktwits and twitter. They also have agreements for July with the Philippines in South Korea so approval should start rolling in I think a lot of countries are waiting for the us but there are countries that have their own decently well-established regulatory agencies that can act on their own.  Worst case it's an extra week or so but at that stage in the game I don't expect to see a giant dip in the price because longs are not going to want to sell their shares and since the floats small the price will stay high.,johnnyknowbest,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nmuzzi/nvax_dd_low_float_hight_short_ratio_7x_future/gzs3iut/,0.044,0.848,0.107,0.9083

1558,BYND," Financial times article on Jim Cramer BYND pump.
Jim Cramer of CNBC Mad Money fame has never been one to shy away from bodacious market calls that appeal to as broad an investing demographic as possible. In his time, he has inspired everyone from Eric Cartman to your granny (probably) to take a flutter on the market.

But, today before US market open, we were struggling to get our heads around this tweet from the dome-headed financial news host.

What on earth is going on here?


One generous interpretation is that Cramer likes fake meat purveyor Beyond Meat’s stock. Why wouldn’t he? After all the $9bn “growth” company grew, err, 11 per cent last quarter making its valuation of 13 times forward revenues seem totally reasonable. Depending on how you spin it, anyway. So perhaps that’s it?


Or perhaps Cramer is not so subtly signalling to the Reddit retail trading army 

To be honest we don’t have a clue.

But if the latter is the case, the tendie-hungry masses seem to have got the message.

In early trading, Beyond Meat’s stock is up nine per cent to $138 on absolutely no news. They did touch $144 earlier.

Cool.

Here’s an idea, though. If we (and yes, that means even FT Alphaville) want to shed the scaly reputation of professional financial journalism perhaps it is better if we don’t go around suggestively egging on the masses into so-called meme securities?

Actually, we’re talking about CNBC.",worrior1129,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nmxyif/bynd_yolo/gzrp2er/,0.054,0.829,0.118,0.9553

1618,FCF," thanks! I 100% understand your thinking and honestly that is part of what I am banking on, that a lot of people haven't been watching too closely because it has been such a dog for so long. I believe GE has turned the corner and adults are once again in charge. I don't think it is the same company it was before things got bloated and ridiculous but I do think the new GE is lean and positioned REALLY well.

Do I think that if GE was fairly valued it should triple? no not at all. However GE's valuation got SO low that even after doubling (which I was along for the ride on) I expect it to continue going up. Right now it is rising on the turnaround story part and over the next year as they continue to aggressively shed debt AND their FCF grows and they start making real profits each quarter the fundamentals will keep the stock moving higher.

As for diversification this isn't the only thing I'm in, just only showed that part of my portfolio.

And I am a huge Tesla fanboy myself. If you were going to give me one million dollars worth of stock from either Tesla or GE I'd take the tesla stock but right now I'm looking to identify shorter term plays that I can profit on using calls to leverage my buying power.

1633,AMZN," I actually believe that the highest probability of a buyout of Rite Aid would come from Walmart.

Walmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company.  However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens.  In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale.  If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over.  WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.

A couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:

\- Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions, thereby lowering its cost

\- All the goods sold in the front end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products that Walmart sells in its department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.

Based on the above 2 points, Walmart improves both its own existing margins and at the same time improves those of the Rite Aid revenue.

The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.

If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $5 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels.

i have two puts if it drops next week or tomorrow so I am covered there. in all if i just learn to stop fucking with shit I would make more money... 

the original june 4th calls likely will end up expiring otm after the down turn and I would have made a good amount.

1674,BYND," There are multiple indicators signaling BYND has moon potential. A golden cross suggests potential for a major price rally. There are three stages: (1) As you can see on the graph, prior to the “u” formation, price action was flat with low volume, indicating selling pressure may be drying up. (2) The shorter moving average (ema 50) crosses up through the longer moving average (ema 200) with a spike in trading volume with good momentum (RSI), signaling a change in trend. (3) Finally, the continuation of an uptrend, leading to a higher price (We are potentially at this point!).  
In addition, a cup and handle price pattern is a bullish indicator where the cup is in a ""u"" and the handle drifts slightly downward. So there's the possibility price will drift slightly downward to fill the gap (not always) before continuing upwards.
