248,OR, It's more difficult to say when it's hovering around the amount. The two most extreme scenarios as far as losing money are that the stock ends at $10.99 and the call expires worthless (forfeiting the whole $174 and leaving you with no shares) OR the stock ends at $11 and you effectively paid $174 to buy 100 shares at $11 each (also losing $174). The date is too close to make a profit bar a miracle so your actions are basically to minimize your loss from $174 to a lower number by exercising the option or selling the call,putjimininmyusername,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m258e9/eli5_options_call/gqhv9oe/,0.153,0.732,0.114,-0.5413
