54,AMZN," The price won't matter for each of these indexes or stocks if you're on a platform that does fractional shares. For example, on Fidelity you can buy $1000 of AMZN even though one share is about $3300. If 1 share of AMZN goes up 2% that day, you're $1000 still goes up 2%. The only difference is 2% of 3300 is $66 and 2% of 1000 is $20, but you're still getting the same percentage gain.

Going forward it'll be very important to just remember % gains over the long-term are what the goal is. Short term $ increases or % increases mean very little. If you're 18 years old, short term is a flexible term, but in investing I'm talking minimum 1-2 years. Long-term 10-50 years. If you're invested in indexes I'd argue that you don't even really care about 2 years for short term because it takes longer than that to get through a recession.

To keep with the theme of 2021 though, September normally being tough (if it were to pan out to that month being tougher) will likely mean that the dip turns out to be a fast 3-4% drop, like all of the other ones for 2021, a snapback, and then choppiness.",95Daphne,6,/r/stocks/comments/ovxp4l/the_average_monthly_sp_500_stock_market_returns/h7cj6oa/,0.033,0.898,0.069,0.6115

101,USA," ZzZzZz People here love talking about things they're ignorant on huh? Why? At least give a decent explanation if you're going to answer.  


China is a socialist market country. What this means is that the government has control and power over companies and what they can or can't do. So if you upset the Chinese Communist Party as a company you can have the hammer going down upon you. The fear from investors in the West is that at any time a Chinese company might get slapped for doing something wrong and have their growth, revenue, etc hammered.  


Two major things happened this month. Didi, the ""Uber of China"" recently did their IPO in the West without going through regulations with the Chinese government. China decided to punish Didi by removing their apps, preventing people from signing up, and supposedly will place hefty fines on the company. The second is that China decided to turn Chinese private tutoring companies non-profit due to how education is so stressed upon in China to the point middle class families are spending exorbitant amounts of money on education because of the competitive nature of the Chinese education system (Really, Asian education system in general). This has basically made all Chinese education stocks worthless, because why would you invest in something that is non-profit.  


So the fear now is that Chinese companies will continually get hammered and stall growth; growth being the main reason why you want to invest in Chinese companies because of quickly China's economy is growing (Estimates state China will be on par with USA by 2028). Other concerns are the USA and China going in to trade war territory again like Trump did.  


The arguments against such fear is that despite being a socialist country, China like the rest of the world is heavily tied in our globalized market. So while China has punishes companies like Didi, and made education non-profit to what can be argued is actually a morally good thing to do, they aren't dumb enough to stifle their own growth when it's already clear they're investing heavily in foreign markets (Just look at their Belt and Road Initiative). They are making it clear to their companies and the world that they are in charge and as one Chinese investor remarked, it's like a parent smacking their kid and sending him to their room. Chinese companies are still on the verge of powerful growth and all this fear is a buying opportunity for investors.   


So the question is, do you believe in Chinese growth long-term and do you believe the risks of the CCP and USA relations are worth it?",ryanxwonbin,26,/r/stocks/comments/ovkz64/china_restrictions_on_stocks/h7aa5nw/,0.095,0.792,0.113,0.6769

146,AM," Fishy? I can be wrong without jumping to ""fishy."" Regardless, I stated in the OP, but am happy to go back and clarify that the bank had refunded the NSF charges, as Joe said they were expected to land Monday, on Friday at 5:00 AM they got a notification they would be reversed. When I called the bank they said the funds were there, they refunded the NSF charges which banks don't like to do unless there was some good reason.  


Past that. I didn't transfer again for two reasons, and why I called support to find out the correct thing to do: 1) Since the funds weren't taken I still had the money but my fear was that if they ran it a second time then I'd be screwed. In other words two deposits with one bit of money. This has happened to me more than once with various companies. 2) As ""instant deposits"" are not ""instant"" I was specifically asking them if I did try another would it fix it since my ""instant deposits"" were restricted. In other words, it seemed to me and I was looking for clarification that by the time it would land it would be too late when, according to them telling me much later, had I simply ""initiated"" a new deposit it would have prevented the liquidation with the only caveat being that I wouldn't be able to use those funds to buy anything till it actually landed. I would have been 1000% okay with that.   


I would accept the skepticism being to the point of ""fishy"" if I made those calls after the liquidations occurred.

154,PI," I am not a financial advisor. 1) 4% withdrawal rule   [https://www.youtube.com/results?search\_query=4+withdrawal+rule](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=4+withdrawal+rule)  2) $500/mo is $6k/yr.  Going by the 4% withdrawal rule you would need $150k. 3) However, 4% withdrawal rule can be a bit risky.  To really play it safe, I would suggest SCHD etf which yields 3% dividends.  It you have $200k in SCHD, you would get $6k/yr dividends without having to touch the principal.  4) I don't think $500/mo is realistic.  That's if you want to live like a working class local, which is far below US/Western living standards.  And that doesn't factor in having to deal with visa issues, occasional returns to the US, etc.  5) Via your library (eg audiobook/ebook on Libby app), check out ""The Automatic Millionaire"" (and other investing books) on how to reach your investment goals.  6) I suggest minimum $500k, invested in SCHD or similar diversified/safe-ish etf, so you would have $12k+/yr to do this PI retirement plan.",chuckwow,0,/r/stocks/comments/oviaeh/looking_to_retire_in_philippines_usa_question_on/h79lgl7/,0.012,0.896,0.092,0.8233
155,AC, Was just in the Phillipines last year. If you're staying with other people for free $500 will be okay. If you are renting and paying your own utilities you'll need more. That will also depend how much you run AC and what type of food you eat. A watermelon at the super markets will still run you 7usd. If you're shopping at the ghetto markets you can get stuff cheaper. I'd give yourself a cushion and aim for $1000 a month. Especially if living off dividends. Dividends can be suspended in a crash or greatly reduced. Municipal bonds might be a better choice. Tax free and bonds will be steadier money. Could probably find some good ones at 3% or so. If you found one at 3% you would need 400k to make a steady 1k every month. The problem is inflation. Bonds won't grow with inflation like stocks would. You would get screwed hard if these higher inflation rates continued for a while after you bought the bond. Reits would be a decent option too. Could probably find some good ones that pay 3-4% there's some that pay up to 10%. Either way if you want more reliable money it's going to take that 400k+. You can go riskier and retire with 100k and try to swing trade leaps. If you really think you only need $500 per month. You could probably go with 200k with the safer options. But you would be giving up a lot of stuff you're used to here in the US.,Mushrooms4we,1,/r/stocks/comments/oviaeh/looking_to_retire_in_philippines_usa_question_on/h7a6vyk/,0.05,0.867,0.083,0.8316

Note that only local produced goods and services are cheap. International brands and goods cost the same everywhere. You want a decent laptop? You pay the same price as in the US.

171,PYPL," There's two schools of thought right now.  One is that PYPL had run too far, too fast, and is heading back to a more fair value.  That, plus increasing competition in payments forms a thesis that PayPal is going below $250 again.  

There's another school that says the drop was a mistake, a knee jerk response to a surprise dip... but that the dip shouldn't have been a surprise because the EBay breakup was a known known, and just happened slightly earlier than expected.  That school also feels that Venmo is a juggernaut so the existence of competition doesn't bother them.

I've had a small position and my thesis was a bit of each, but I held through earnings with the intent to sell if it popped.  That didn't happen so I had to make a new plan.  I still intend to sell, but now I'm looking to do so into strength when people realize the earnings sell off was a bit much.  Murphy's Law may prevent that, as the story that ""there's lots of competition"" is one that can be told today, whereas ""Venmo is crushing it"" is a story that will more likely be told in slower quarterly instalments.",Summebride,1,/r/stocks/comments/ow01my/is_paypals_pypl_dip_worth_buying/h7cut2y/,0.041,0.877,0.082,0.7939
