0,CRWD," I dont get this market. just 3 weeks ago it was game over for tech. those folks at CNBC were talking about how toxic the shares of CRWD or Twlo or NET were, while raging about bank stocks and commodities.

I know better not to shift my portfolio based on some flavors of the month. I only invest in quality growth, as long term that produces best returns. higher beta higher alpha. 

Btw, my position in NET has almost doubled in value past 4 weeks. thanks to idiots selling shares, I was able to pick up few more shares to fill out my position.

2,ATH," OP:Tech stock movement, in this market, makes as much sense as the movement of Bitcoin.  It is a fool who looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart.

As you’ll see, people heavily invested in tech stocks can explain how any market behavior that causes those tech stocks to go up is perfectly rational.  What is more likely, that Tech stocks can‘t get to a point of being overvalued or that the overly optimistic are very poor judges of value when they have been richly rewarded for their optimism (so far)?

Many of the tech stock are up 5x over the last 5 years (and 5 years ago was, itself, an ATH and a very healthy economy for tech)  There is nothing that justifies that and when the party ends these tech stocks are going to be the highest percentage losers (just like in 2000).",ALMessenger,1,/r/investing/comments/o29z8t/todays_tech_rally_im_confused_isnt_more_hawkish/h26xlsi/,0.058,0.781,0.16,0.9432
3,GOOG," Big tech is not going to be slowed down by the hawkish fed policy is why.

Take Google.   Last quarter they grew the top line by over 30% YoY.  That is compared too a non convid impaired quarter.    Bottom line grew by well over 100% YoY.  Also a nice increase in margins.

https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2021Q1_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=0cd3d78

That type of growth is why GOOG is up 48% so far this year.  Maybe we can break 50% today ;).

Google has assets yet to be fully monetized.  Nothing better than a company that gives away really valuable sh*t.   Creates a great runway.",bartturner,1,/r/investing/comments/o29z8t/todays_tech_rally_im_confused_isnt_more_hawkish/h270wxe/,0.025,0.763,0.213,0.9551
4,NOW," True.....except NOW market is saying unwinding QE and raising interest rates will dry up liquidity and lead to deflationary environment, which will be good for tech....looking farther ahead in the cycle....",ErinG2021,1,/r/investing/comments/o29z8t/todays_tech_rally_im_confused_isnt_more_hawkish/h27yp9q/,0.0,0.831,0.169,0.7096
5,AAPL," Market factors a lot of things. And as some investors who have been around the block would say cynically that ""Everything is already priced in"".

Market probably priced in rate hikes that were larger, more numerous, more sudden, and sooner than what JPOW stated the FEDs are planning when he last spoke.

From his words we gain a few things:

1. Feds are watching inflation closely (bullish).

2. JPow and other top econ/biz guys in at the FED still feels inflation is transitory and don't mind robust inflation (neutral)

3. Feds are now planning 2 rate hikes by 2023 (neutral)

So let's go over each. 

1st is a bullish factor because markets were starting to get worried the FED are sleeping at the wheel or straight DUI. Watching inflation says otherwise.

2nd Is their stance on transitory inflation. That means prices will go back down for most things but not everything with applied inflation staying without the same elevated levels of inflation we've seen this year.

3rd I think is where OP is focusing the most because it's the most important. It might seem like neutral, but IMO I take it as a bullish signal. For certain sectors it's very bullish.

* Sure 2 rate hikes are planned now by 2023. But that means there won't be 3-10 hikes. If you asked me I would have guess a week ago I would have said 2-4 hikes by 2023 on the light end and 5-8 hikes by 2023 on the heavy end. If markets did the same and ""priced in"" more hikes and now sees less then they'll correct. In this case for tech they will go up with financials going down.

* Most of it determined by how bad inflation is, but the FED usually raises rates by 0.25% to 0.5%. They don't usually make steady inclines and HEAVY cuts when recessions/depressions happen. We've got new CERTAINTY that rates will remain relateively low. Markets hate uncertainty. Lastly 2 rate hikes is literally nothing and something the markets can shrug off. We'll correct downward for a bit before continuing our bull run.

* At some point, it's prudent for the host to take away the punch bowl. FED wants the economy to be robust, but they aren't exactly out to make dumb far OTM WSB bull calls work out. Increasing rates isn't as bad as some people expect. It's NOT normal to have such low rates. It's NOT good to have too much inflation. It's NOT good to have too much easy access to liquidity. And NOT good to just keep rates near 0 where you can't cut them in the future while holding down the pedal for too long.

* Let's say the FEDs decide inflation is out of control by September they instantly rise the rates by 0.5% TWICE by the end of 2021. That means we'll be slightly above 1%. It might hurt absolutely negative-profit money-losing ultra-growth ""tech"", but the established companies like HP/LENO/IBM/Semis/TWTR/SNAP/etcetc wouldn't be hurt by that. 

* But to the FAAAM guys? It's 1% LITERALLY FUCKING NOTHING. FAAAM has been dominating at whatever they've decided to dominate the last 20 years. [When rates were at 1%, hiked to +5%, dipped back to near 0%, when it was hiked back to 2.5%, and now dropped to near 0% again.](https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart) 1% is not going to stop Amazon killing small businesses, exploiting it's workers, and not paying taxes by running money losing expansion businesses to kill off competition. 1% interest won't stop people asking google everything, android not being the other OS, and google compiling tons of data while leading AI. It won't stop AAPL from selling the tech equivalent of luxury hand bags, the apple ecosystem being less sticky, or overcharging for access to the app store. It won't make xboxes not profitable or people stop using PCs. In fact 1% just means tech will continue to dominate like they did the last 20 years. Come back when it's at least 5%.

13,GDP," The fed has historically been very opaque, speaking softly and sending cryptic messages and smoke signals.  An announcement that interest rates could be increased in 2023 instead of 2024 is indeed hawkish.   Coupled with an increased GDP projection.  Inflation hedges such as commodities and gold dropped.

14,DCF," Raising rates to control inflation hurts growth more than value though. Just do a DCF calculation and see what happens if the interest rate goes up. Inflation is bad for growth whether the Fed reacts by hiking rates or remains asleep at the wheel.

The bet here seems to be that the Fed will be correct in predicting there will be transitory inflation only and hence no need to raise rates to begin with. Powell himself said to take the dot plot with a big grain of salt.

I'm skeptical and sticking with value at this point.

43,GME," The biggest problem with the whole post GME thing is that everyone is trying to replicate it.  Short squeezes are flash in the pan once in a while events - there's only been a dozen or so noteworthy ones in the last two decades.  

I wasn't kidding above about the number of people from different subs.  We've come across 5-6 subs dedicated to pumping some random stock within the last week.  It's all the same format - let's go to the big subs and spread awareness/argue about our stock.  And they act shocked when they get bans.  

I suspect a large portion of this is funded by big finance, especially the larger and more active subs - I've been in this industry long enough to recognize when retail is getting fleeced, and using them to generate interest in a given stock is pretty textbook big finance fleecing activity.  

Even GME was only tangentially tied to retail.  Maybe that run from $5 to $50 or so was retail, but everything since then has been high speed institutional warfare with lots of broke retail people getting caught in the crossfire.  You can see it in the block trades happening on the regular - there's so much institutional money taking the long end of this thing and unloading to unsuspecting noobs.  

But that's not really my business, my business is making sure that sort of rabid nonsense doesn't ruin this sub.  I've got no idea why people are treating a given stock as if it's a religion they've been mandated by the market gods to spread to the masses, but it's just making most people annoyed.",MasterCookSwag,78,/r/investing/comments/o2w3qk/reminderclarification_on_our_stance_on_subreddit/h28l3mc/,0.095,0.849,0.057,-0.8979

50,HUGE," Interest rates were mostly going down or sideways from 2015-2017 for the most part. Plus rates had been on a slow decline entering that time period to start with. 

Interest rates did increase slightly in 2018 for a very short time. During that short period, the housing and stock market quickly started crashing. The only reason it didn’t crash was the fed quickly reversed course and lowered rates to historic lows to revive the market. 

Given the reason they raised them in 2018 was they had no choice. They said they had to eventually raise them because the rate was too low to be sustainable. Now we have no interest rate. How sustainable do you think that is? They can't just raise it a little. They going to have to raise it a lot. To a rate that a sane person, would consider loaning their money out at. That is a long way from zero. 

The bottom line is why would anyone loan their money out at zero percent interest? Would you loan your money out at zero percent? Obviously, there is a reason the Fed had been doing that and it can’t be a good one. 

Hint: It is to keep the markets from crashing. But there is a catch. You can’t loan your money out at zero percent interest to people to buy your products forever? That is simply not sustainable and the FED knows it. Only can do that trick for so long before that comes back to bite you. 

Also, keep in mind there is a HUGE difference between having a low-interest rate and the rate going up a little.

53,IMO," What you give up with QYLD is the flexibility of what calls you write.

For example, maybe you have a stock at $50, and you write a $60 covered call on it. If it goes to $90 then gets called at $60, do you buy back in at $90 after selling for $60? Alternatively, suppose you have a stock at $50 with a $60 covered call, but it drops to $30 and the option expires. Do you write a new covered call at $36 to collect a decent premium(and end up having the option executed at $40 locking in your loss), or do you write at $60 again and collect basically no premium?

With QYLD, all of that is decided for you, and these option strategies mean taking on all of the downside risk of equities, while giving up most of the upside, all to collect a premium.

QYLD has historically underperformed the market by eliminating upside. If you really want income, IMO there are safer, more sustainable ways of achieving it.",skilliard7,1,/r/investing/comments/o2iqtz/is_investing_in_qyld_at_the_same_time_investing/h28c7ur/,0.045,0.894,0.061,0.4214

TSLA to pull back not break 620 nor drop below 595. It has bullish tendencies. 

MSFT to pull back before ex dividend Monday. Probably finish Friday low. Wait for end of day to buy. But buy if RSI is over sold. Good bullish tendencies.

XOM to trend up. Weak bullish tendencies. Watch oil wti spot price to guess its movement. 

Same for all oil companies.

KO to trend down. Bearish tendencies.

Beginning of day, and for this downtrend. Bears were in control.

Maybe in the next 45 minutes, but probably not until Monday, Bulls WILL BE IN CONTROL. \*big cheer\*.  


I don't see any news reasons the sentiment will change. Always recheck the sentiment before decisions are made. But I'm cautiously optimistic that for the first time in 10+ trading days, banks are about to be bullish again.  


Given all the headwind, I see this as a good sign. Because once that headwind changes for the better that tailwind will really hammer the last of the bears outta there.  


Classic trading strategies suggest this is nearing reversal. And it's been a painful walk trust me. But these are quantitative assessments.  


Mostly: banks started trading in a tail.  
That tail is deviating upward from the trendline on lower volume.  
When the price goes below the trend line volume increases. When prices go above the trendline it's at lower volume.

These factors all have to be considered and yes, I learned them the hard way. On Pepsi in fact. Was going to the moon, then wasn't.

My sentiment was that TSLA was a weak bull, so because it was still a bull it would buck the sell off and rebound but not break 620. Not a bad entry then to buy the dip.

At 620 you'd have earned about 3%.

At 627 even more, great.

Also that audiobook towards 1:30 gets deep into volume, and charting reading to determine if trends are strong or breaking.  


JPM as an example, it shows signs of breaking, but it also keeps trending with the yield rates right now, and yield rates are lagging because 2-years jump before 10-years. So there's a ""flattening"" of the yield spread.

That's a feature of Banks I didn't know 2 days ago, now I know. And it further helps confirm when to actually buy banks right now.

If you're already in, we're in hold territory.

If you're out, stay out for now, there's some floor to possibly lose because:

  
Never bet on bears.

JPM may be ripening for a reversal but it's still in bear territory.

So what I want to do going forward is bet only on Bulls.

I'm not concerned with finding the best bull. I'm surprised that TSLA made a breakout through is near-term resistance today. But I'm less surprised since it's in bull territory.

I didn't bet TSLA would lose price. I stated it'd have a pullback and I capped its target to resistance. That's GOOD trading practice.

It did have a pullback, and it hit its resistance. Breaking resistance is bonus.

I'd rather be wrong about more profit than be wrong about loss.

So this method that I'm now working with does exactly that.

I can see which are going to be losers and when, I can see if they are bulls then it's worth waiting a day or two to win, and I can see if they are bears to stay the FYCK out...

That audiobook made no sense, until  I slammed my head into the wall a few week and felt exactly what he was saying. Now it makes perfect sense.

So, you can sit there in disbelief, your loss.

Or you can recognize I am calling good picks -now-. Not 2 weeks ago.  


And the change is that now I can see the sentiment of the traders in that stock. Where before I couldn't, I didn't know how to look for it.

Three things:

1) Last few nights I blind tested this with my friend. He'd pick a stock, a date, no price, just MACD and RSI. I'd predict based on the previous day's performance how the next day would generally behave, and by the first hour of the next day it was pretty well confirmed how the whole day would play out. We did this with 20 stocks, on different dates. And I was right about the trend without even looking at the next day.

Why?  
Because sentiment drives price.

2) My current picks, after figuring out how to use MACD/RSI to determine sentiment, have been correct. JPM is still a bad buy for me, because it was my last trade before putting this together.

I would NOT buy JPM even right now. Knowing what I'd know. I'd watch it like a hawk for the last signals of a reversal and buy then.

  
I'm stuck making 1 decision. Do I pause and wait for that reversal, or sell out and pursue other stocks in the meantime.

3) Looking back at MO, which I did, I hate myself thinking that was a ""buy the dip"". The MACD/RSI shows obvious bear strength. And sure enough rather than pull through the dividend like it sometimes does historically, it just dropped. It's in the same field as JPM right now. Bear territory.

Stocks I sold out too early on like XOM and MSFT were because I didn't realize as their price pulled back, their pullbacks were against strong bull sentiment. And looking back at them it's very obvious.

But I blind-backtested the MACD/RSI comparison against VZ, AAPL, SNAP, PEP, KO, various others as well.  


I don't need to see price, I know exactly what the price will do based on that comparison.

What is next needed is use of price to determine entry/exit targets.

But you need to know first if the sentiment is on you side.

Don't bet on bears thinking something will improve its price, bears win.

\*\*\*Bet on bulls unless the sentiment turns against you.\*\*\* TSLA is a good example. It's in Bull territory and it's making a nice run inspite of overbought territory yesterday. It should sell off some, and it did pull back, but now midday it's giving a nice surprise. Bull sentiment will do that sometimes, and never turn on you if you keep an eye on it.

Bear sentiment will burn you every time, trying to catch profit from a bear is like trying to catch a thrown dagger. PEP is a good example.

JPM is in a hard place right now. It's sandwiched between a real hard support, losing bearish sentiment, and strong future expectations. Plus a lot of pain on the losing side. Once that pain washes out, bulls will pull ahead.

Or you can recognize I am calling good picks -now-. Not 2 weeks ago.  


And the change is that now I can see the sentiment of the traders in that stock. Where before I couldn't, I didn't know how to look for it.

Three things:

1) Last few nights I blind tested this with my friend. He'd pick a stock, a date, no price, just MACD and RSI. I'd predict based on the previous day's performance how the next day would generally behave, and by the first hour of the next day it was pretty well confirmed how the whole day would play out. We did this with 20 stocks, on different dates. And I was right about the trend without even looking at the next day.

Why?  
Because sentiment drives price.

2) My current picks, after figuring out how to use MACD/RSI to determine sentiment, have been correct. JPM is still a bad buy for me, because it was my last trade before putting this together.

I would NOT buy JPM even right now. Knowing what I'd know. I'd watch it like a hawk for the last signals of a reversal and buy then.

  
I'm stuck making 1 decision. Do I pause and wait for that reversal, or sell out and pursue other stocks in the meantime.

163,MSCI," 

Hi,


First time investor here and I’m in a kind of limited choice situation due to my country's (Thailand) retirement scheme. Basically I can invest 30% of my income and deduct the investment from my taxable income. This alone will give me a 10% return just from tax savings.


Unfortunately, I’m also forced to pick from the very limited offerings of the local banks.

I’d like to invest in SPY, ACWI-ex-US and MSCI emerging markets.


From what’s available, I found a S&P500(TER 1.1%) and an ACWI(TER 0.6%). An ACWI-ex-US is not available, so I would be exposed to the US with both, as the ACWI has 60% US stocks on its own already. In that situation, would you go with both or only ACWI since it has enough US exposure already?


Also, I’ve been advised that I should put 20% into bonds for now as there is too much liquidity in the market from covid and then shift it into index funds if/when a contraction happens.


Basic Info:


35 yo

Thailand

No debt

No savings :(

Objective and horizon: Keep the money in a diversified passive index and dont touch until retirement

Risk tolerance: Moderate I guess. I’m expecting indexes to go up and down quite a bit over the decades and just want to wait them out without actively trying to beat the market.",kessel0222,2,/r/investing/comments/o2kphl/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h271c15/,0.117,0.85,0.033,-0.9469

I may switch to another insurance provider which doesn’t have a health savings account.

177,GDP," Record unemployment that isn't getting better despite the false unemployment rate (look at workforce participation rate and total US employment). 

Unemployment benefits are running out. People are getting evicted. Stimulus is the only thing keeping the economy afloat. Our GDP fell hard and the government spent trillions to make up the difference. That's not sustainable. We will see how strong the economy is when it tries to stand on its own two legs without the government injecting cash. 

This happened in 2007 and 2008. Bush signed a stimulus before the markets crashed. It kept things afloat for a while. It takes time before companies start going bankrupt. This stimulus was so massive we probably kicked the can out to 2022. Poorer than expected earnings should show up as early as Q4 2021. But it will still take a while for bankruptcies to take place. 

The stimulus and the fed didn't actually fix anything. They gave us pain killers so we feel alright. Once we sober up we will see the damage in the earnings reports.",BeaverWink,-3,/r/investing/comments/o2dxxg/anyone_worried_about_your_investments/h2657gm/,0.142,0.822,0.035,-0.9621
178,GDP," GDP should be returning pre COVID level in the next quarter or so with more going back to work. People have money in their bank accounts from COVID, as irrational as that may sound. Spending will be improving if not more with income starts to flow again. If this is true, and given the market tanked people will buy in as those that missed the 2020 market crash. A flash crash if you will. Market does not represent the economy, at least for now. 


Aftermath of eviction is already in effect. Landlords already not receiving money from renters. Eviction is irrelevant. It’s a good thing actually because it will lower the acceleration of rent increases. The quickly eviction occurs the quicker to restart the cash cycle in the realty sector. As cruel as that sound.

179,NYT," Yeah, I agree.  I was hoping for a quick cashout, and then seeing how they do long term, maybe buy back in when it stabilized.  But even though they are a ""tech"" firm, I'm not sure how well they are known outside the medical field (though that is changing--most ads were previously from pharma and medical equipment companies, and now I'm seeing more financial institutions and even some tourism ads perhaps seeking upper middle class eyeballs).

They offer a good service.  Initially it was just a social media network for physicians to connect and discuss articles (some medically related popular news articles like NYT, NPR.org, etc. and other more meaty stuff like journal articles from JAMA or Nature).  I liked the fact that you have to be verified/licensed to join and there's less of your conspiracy theorists/right wing religious/left wing hippies stereotypical low effort responses that tend to be on other social media.  They've expanded to include HIPAA compliant telehealth in the past year which I have not used (I don't really do much telehealth, and the few occasions I've needed to my hospital already has that technology), but in previous years they came out with a dialer app (so I can make it look like I'm dialing from my practice office or the hospital so patients know it's me without having my personal cell or home phone) and HIPAA compliant e-Fax which I do use a few times a month.

The prospectus states that they have monetized with advertising that is targeted based on my specialty and article reading trends.  (We can claim continuing medical education for scientific journal articles that we read, so they know exactly what my reading pattern is and which articles I tend to read including how much time I spend on each one.)  One of the potential pitfalls is that something like only 10 or 20 companies make up the bulk of their advertising budget so if one of them were to decide to drop them, that'd be a huge financial hit.

I have no idea if they plan on having premium services yet--I can definitely see some smaller practices that for the right price, might go with them, but for example, with other established telehealth companies, they aren't really competitive in that landscape to pick up large hospital contracts where the money really is.  Would I be willing to pay for the dialer and HIPAA compliant fax?  Yeah, probably, but not very much.  And I'm sure many users use it as a convenience only and have other ways to complete the same tasks (for example, we have a doctor line where we call into the switchboard and ask for the operator to dial an outside line for us so the hospital number shows up but this saves that extra step).  This is also why I don't think they're after the doctors as suckers.  They state that the most active users were targeted for this offer, and if that is the case (and I have no reason to believe it is not), they want to keep us happy so we keep using the platform as we are the product they are selling!",WuMedic,2,/r/investing/comments/o2vxb9/anyone_have_experience_with_ipos_when_is_the/h28ptoq/,0.054,0.849,0.097,0.9746
