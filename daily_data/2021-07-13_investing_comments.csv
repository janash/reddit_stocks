5,FL," Funny you should post about the region I grew up in (nova) and where I currently live (FL). Having just had to help my mom work through a LOT of retirement and financial planning, I would lean more towards keeping your house in VA and renting it out. Here's why:

Nova is always a hot real estate market, that won't change. So if you need the cash, no problem selling.

Finding renters just outside of DC is relatively easy and you can have a management company keep up with it.

FL has a lot of theme park rentals for sale right now due to Covid and investors dumping property. However, the market is crazy hot right now in this area and vacation rentals are doing very poorly. Big investment, low returns right now. Could turn around, but more families are avoiding the rentals here right now. I am seeing a lot more guests stay at the resorts/park hotels/nearby hotels.

Same as above for vacation rentals elsewhere. It's not always easy to make a profit from vacation rentals unless it's a high tourism area (which means expensive). Tourism hasn't picked up yet, at least nowhere near where it was. 

As for financial security, the financial planners we met with to help my mom through retirement all recommended some form of passive income to supplement her SS and retirement fund. Having additional monthly income that is secure will allow more freedom down the line. You can invest the profits from rental now, while you have more time in the market and still have the asset later to either sell (if you need a cash influx) or to supplement your retirement income.

Personally, my plan is to pay off my house in 2 years, then save for a new home. Rent out the first house to supplement paying off house 2 in under 10 years. Then save up and buy our retirement home and a vacation home using the first 2 rentals as supplemental income to quickly pay down the retirement and vacation home (staggered purchase, but both paid off inside of 15 years). That will provide us with 2 guaranteed passive income properties, 1 potentially profitable vacation rental, and a very nice full time home for us to live in right as we reach retirement. The passive incomes should be more than enough to cover our monthly expenses which leaves our retirement accounts for us to play with however we want.

Quick edit: for those saying index fund only... yes, it will build wealth, and relatively quickly, but in retirement you will have to draw from that and a bad year in the market means that fund drops quickly when you are taking disbursements from it. Really look at your long term planning and what you want/need in retirement.",Supa66,2,/r/investing/comments/oj3pgx/with_an_extra_300k_would_you_invest_in_an_index/h510lgi/,0.039,0.808,0.153,0.9958
6,CPA," I haven't scrolled through everything, but none of the top comments seem to mention by far the most obvious concerns: tax ramifications and the real estate sales commission.  You sure it's not more like ""Pocket the $300K, pay $80K in taxes and commissions, and invest $220K in an index fund?""  Plus you might give up a hell of a lot in homeowner tax breaks.

If you go with another property, you could 1031 Exchange your way out of some taxes, but you'd need to talk to your CPA to figure out how to do that.  Plus you might give up a hell of a lot in homeowner tax breaks.

And then there's the aspect that home purchases with a mortgage are leveraged investments.  You have $300K in equity - say the home is worth $600K.  A 10% increase in your home value ($60K) isequal to an almost 30% increase in your index fund, assuming you got bombed back down to $220K.

I dunno.  This post seems to be full of ""Daw bro - index fund all day long"" responses when any experienced high(er) net worth investor would be looking hard at the tax ramifications.  Personally, I would stick with the existing home unless there was a genuinely compelling reason to pick another option because when in doubt, going long and reducing your tax burden is always a good choice.  And trust me - $300K isn't that much money.  Don't get accidentally stupid and think you've got it made.

19,CPA," WIthout knowing anything about your financial situation or where you are in your earning career, your answers are going to vary based upon where others are in their journey.

Personally as someone who is 40, earning great income my goal is to minimize tax liabilty and real estate is a great way to doing so.  Depreciation is a powerful tool, while you know yourself that the property is going to appreciate as well.  So if it were me, I would keep the property, tell your CPA its a rental now and start getting depreciation off of it at a 27.5 year schedule.  You can sell it in 3 years (you need to be in a home for 2 out of the past 5 years) and not pay any capital gains, or sell it whenever you want down the line and 1031 it into something else and defer.  If I need money down the road I could cash out refi and not pay a dime on taxes.

As someone who has 11 units, I have property managment in place for 7 of them.  I have not had any missed payments, tenants have been great. They screen and do a great job finding good tenants.  

That being said, I invest in index/stocks in my retirement accounts so I am not adverse to investing in stocks.

23,NYC," Its sort of a juice not being worth the squeeze thing.

Its not that the property management company takes too much. Its that you need to set up a relationship with one. There's 3 interviews right there. Then there's the hassle of buying out of state. Loan approvals, finding realtor, negotiating, understanding the market to see if your house is a good purchase. Figuring out repair contractors ( property management will do this, but itl cost more). All of this takes time.

If you're buying a couple places its worth it. The second house will be 50x easier than the first. Youl have the management down. 

So if I go out of state let's say maybe I wanna expand to Chicago. Its much easier to buy like 4 places there, than to buy 1 in Kansas city, 1 in NYC, and 2 in Florida.

37,YOU," U know whatever dd you do on the stocks? Its like that, only easier, and itl actually provide you some value.

1st thing you gotta do is find someone to copy. This is not an original business.. You go find someone who owns maybe 15-20 properties and you ask them how they buy. YOU NEED SOMEONE VERSED IN YOUR MARKET. Theyl probably be much more open than you'd guess. And if not, just get their name and run through your local property records. Youl be able to see what they bought and when. Get zillow and see whats for rent and see what their returns are. You should be looking at your market at lot. You should be write a paper about the different parts of your city real estate wise.

Figuring out how to do all that can take a bit of time, but understanding and identifying an undervalued house is far easier than stock. Also calculated returns based on what it will rent for are far more locked in than any stock returns.

Oo and another tip, always have a mindset of keeping money in your pocket.

44,UI," Inflation can manifest via supply shortages. It's called demand pull inflation.

If supply was always sufficient to meet demand, there would be no need to increase prices, you would just sell more and retain the same margins.

So stating that it's a shortage is not a very compelling argument against there not being inflation. A gas shortage  was one of the major reasons for inflation in the 70s, for example. Just drill new wells, and prices will come down right? Of course, but what's the timeframe

The government basically helicoptered trillions of dollars to citizens which greatly increased their buying power. Retail sales numbers showed multiple years worth of gains just in 2020.

Of course there will be shortages when demand is majorly inflated via artificial means.

That being said, stimulus and enhanced UI will end soon. The question is will an inflationary mindset become entrenched before deflationary effects kick in?",strawlion,2,/r/investing/comments/ojelvu/cpi_rises_9_in_june_54_over_last_12_months/h5272a0/,0.086,0.83,0.083,0.6388

51,USA," >Wouldn’t imputed rent cover the cost of home ownership in CPI?

Yes, but that's my point. Imputed rent right now is supposed to represent the price of home ownership, but because of the enormous distortion between rent prices and home prices right now, the imputed rent is far lower than what the home ownership component of CPI should naturally be. That gap will naturally close, causing the home ownership component of CPI to gradually rise.

>Likewise, I don’t see why you’d expect boomers retiring to have any significant effect on inflation, either positive or negative. Do millennials show a greater disposition towards consumption compared to prior generations?

Two factors here.

1. Younger people who are buying homes & starting families are the largest consuming cohort of any economy. As this cohort gets more $, more of the percentage of their income relative those that they are replacing will likely go to consumption.
2. Any soon-to-retire cohort (such as the boomers right now) is somewhat the opposite, where they're at peak income, yet most of their income goes into saving for their coming retirement. This has been especially noteworthy with the boomers notably playing catchup after years of not saving enough for their own retirements. This cohort is gradually dropping out of the equation here.

The result is that the ratio of consumption to investment is likely going to be changing somewhat over the next 5 -10 years. I have no clue how strong an effect this will be, but this is a definite secular trend that will likely have an impact to at least some extent. For reference, Boomer demographics played a large role in inflation trends that were seen through the 70's and 80's as well, so there is a definite precedent for demographic relationships with inflation.

>Plus boomers have already been retiring and will continue to into the future, it won’t happen all at once. Labor participation rate should continue to decline over the coming years but this is offset by a lower natural unemployment rate.

Yeah, and this is all why I'm suggesting the demographic shift of labor employment in the USA will probably be a much more gradual and much more subtle driver of inflation. I don't think it's going to by itself cause some enormous shock in prices, but demographics in my opinion are a lot more important than people realize over longer time frames. Far from the only important factor however.

54,BAM," >""used cars accounted for so much inflation, so just remove them from the calculation and bam, no inflation baby!""

Analysts remove it for comparative purposes. It is still included in CPI for cost of living adjustments. But remember, CPI is a composite made up of components. And by better understanding the components, we can better understand the composite. If this doesn't work for you, then maybe finance and economics aren't for you.

>Housing up 20% YoY, how about we stop using house prices and pretend they are renting instead? BAM all inflation gone baby!

There is no good reason to include assets in the CPI. Asset prices have a zero sum affect, good for some and bad for others. And sense twice as many people own a house as rent, house appreciation is an overall net benefit to twice as many people.

>And people wonder why inflation is always so low even though they feel it to be much higher. The inflation calculation is an art, not science.

58,AI," The F-35, as you rightly discuss, is the key to LMT's success. The fighter jet has been a troubled project from the start, with the multiple variants as requested by different branches of the armed forces causing design, compatibility, and production headaches. But after so many years, the program is nearing combat-test readiness.

There is a good article in [Jane's](https://www.janes.com/defence-news/news-detail/pentagon-services-face-unaffordable-f-35-operations-and-sustainment-costs-by-2036) covering the high operation costs that the program present. Jane's quotes the F-35 Joint Program Office as forecasting the program will require an annual sustainment investment of USD7.8 million, with the affordability constraint of USD4.1 million.

The long-term effect of this budget gap is unclear. The Pentagon is committed to the program, but may be faced with budget cutting elsewhere. The Biden Administration doesn't seem to be especially pro (or anti-) defense, so I would expect defense appropriations to remain largely flat with a slow indexed rise.

For LMT, this may mean fewer future F-35 orders. That will put pressure on other company programs, of which there are many. You mention Boeing as a competitor, which I don't really see outside heavy lift airframes. Drone technology presents a huge opportunity, as does AI, an area that LMT has expertise.

Dividends are friendly, especially considering LMT has so much growth ahead. 600 may be a bit aggressive, but it's by no means a fancy.

60,LMT," Their fundamentals are great. Nice cash flows with enough assets to pay off all debts. You are right that at the current price, the P/E is 15.20 which means it's not hype inflated - like most stocks are atm. The only thing I don't like about LMT is the growth %. Obviously it's a huge company so don't expect crazy growth - but paying $300+ for maybe $400-500 return in the next 5 years, I don't know. I'm a cheap investor though so $300 present value for those returns is a big ask of me.

63,BA," Boeing and Lockheed Martin have coexisted for a very long time.

I firmly believe the U.S. will implement universal healthcare by 2035. Although how that money will be procured is up for debate, there could be a heavy fallout for military spending to help keep taxes in check.

68,LMT," I'll offer a differing opinion. Aerojet is fading from relevance and the long term prospects for them are kinda bleak. Right now they supply engines to the Delta IV, Atlas V second stage, Vulcan second stage, and SLS.

Delta IV is being retired so no new engines will be made for it. I think there's only 1 or 2 more launches for it.

Atlas V is being retired so no new engines will be made for it. Atlas V also switched from AJR to Northrop Grumman solid boosters a few years ago.

Vulcan is only using Aerojet RL10 engines on the second stage; Aerojet lost to blue origin for the first stage engines and Northrop Grumman for the solid rocket boosters. Also ULA who is making Vulcan is a joint venture of Lockheed and Boeing so there's not really competition between Lockheed and Boeing.

SLS is probably the biggest source of income for AJR right now since they're supplying the first and second stage engines. But SLS is insanely expensive. SpaceX is developing Starship which will match or exceed SLS capabilities at multiple orders of magnitude lower cost. Once starship is flying regularly in a year or so, I suspect politicians will start to question the need for SLS given how expensive it is. Once another rocket is developed that can compare to SLS (blue origin is in a good position to do that) then we may see SLS get the axe, and AJRs biggest revenue source with it. The only thing protecting SLS (and by extension AJR) is that politicians want the jobs it creates.

At the end of the day, nearly all space companies today are developing their own engines in house, ULA being the notable exception (ULA is the weird child of Lockheed and Boeing so it makes sense). It's unlikely AJR will win another engine contract besides what they already have lined up so I don't think they will be a significant revenue source for LMT long term and doesn't make me feel bullish for LMT.

81,IMO," Repurposing commercial estate: I’m wondering what you guys think will happen to all this vacant commercial real estate and how it can be repurposed. For instance, a chain electronics store near me went bankrupt due to COVID. They were already on the way out before that but now they’re gone. Their stand-alone building near me has a huge parking lot, is across the street from a Walmart and other destination stores near a major freeway exit, and is in decent shape. It would be a great location to be taken over by a home decor store like At Home that has grown and expanded during COVID. No idea whether something like that will happen. 

I see all these vacant (or close) banking buildings and empty strip mall stores with For Lease signs on them as leases were not renewed or businesses folded. Sure, some tenants may come back and new ones may take some of their places. But some of it will or should be repurposed IMO. My city has even discussed buying one of them and converting it into some kind of large-scale homeless shelter, since that is also a growing problem.

This isn't a great comparison but I suppose I think about it in a similar manner to investing in CPG brands (soda, whatever) vs investing in ""shelves"" (Walmart, Target, etc.)   I think with cannabis, it's going to be somewhat harder in regards to pure play growers and brands. In Canada companies produced like Canadians were going to be getting baked 24/7/365 and the reality wasn't that - 

From 2019:

""Canopy Growth, a company listed in Toronto under the ticker WEED, said it harvested 40,570kg and wrote down C$15.9m ($12m) worth of inventory in the three months to the end of September. Aurora Cannabis, a competitor, reaped 41,436kg. **Each company’s production alone was enough to meet the entire nation’s legal recreational demand, according to Cannabis Benchmarks, a data group.""** (""Canada racks up 400-tonne cannabis mountain after production binge"" https://www.ft.com/content/546b9226-0c7b-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84)

From 2021:

""Last week, MJBizDaily reported that Canada had amassed a staggering 1.06 million kilograms of cannabis inventory – equivalent to more than 1 billion grams. The surge was evident in Health Canada’s recently released inventory data for October, when most of the fall outdoor harvest comes in.

Most of the stock – some 95% – was with federal license holders, which have been stuck with large storage bills, and eventually write-downs, as the value of the product falls over time.""

I do think that weed is absolutely going to be a theme, but it's absolutely a category that is going to be impacted by any periods of overproduction. Additionally, I think given the varied effects from strain-to-strain and how specific cannabis is, how many people are going to want to try a lot of different things (and you look at dispensaries in many areas having dozens of different flower choices + new ones all the time) rather than necessarily often  sticking with a ""favorite."" Additionally, with inconsistency going to happen on occasion, you're going to have instances where someone has a strain from a producer that they like and maybe they get it again a few months later and it's not as good quality a batch as the prior one.  There's going to be solid brands in weed, but it's going to be - imo - tough to make a really strong brand that can stand the test of time.

So, to me - in the case of weed, investing in ""shelves"" (and there are going to continue to be a limited amount of ""shelves"" although the number of dispensaries in a state will likely grow in a gradual/controlled fashion over time) is more appealing and some things are making it into more of a destination/experience on top of it (Planet 13)

Additionally, I do also have an investment in Ginkgo Bioworks, which is working with Cronos on cultured cannabinoids (https://www.ginkgobioworks.com/our-work/producing-cultured-cannabinoids/.) 

Beau Wrigley (whose cannabis co is going public via a SPAC in Canada) talked earlier this year about working with cultured cannabinoids and targeting specific ones and then wrapping products around use cases, and that's interesting. Given Wrigley's experience with the gum company of the same name, there's someone who can potentially build strong brands.

Through a yeast-based microbial process, Eleszto Genetika can genetically sequence rare cannabinoids and engineer specific effects at commercial scale. One future product Wrigley is excited about is CBN, a cannabinoid that helps improve sleep.

He goes on, his Italian water dog, Rio, sitting at his feet: “One of these products is bigger than the entire company.” (https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2021/02/10/billionaire-beau-wrigley-says-his-cannabis-company-will-be-bigger-than-the-family-candy-business/?sh=695471a8451c)",dvdmovie1,2,/r/investing/comments/ojbpg4/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h528vwa/,0.036,0.869,0.095,0.9919

I’m looking to invest 7-10k for the first time in my life. I have about 70k in savings. 20k of it in a normal savings account and about 45k in a “high yield” American Express savings account. I’m engaged, own a home, and have no debt besides the house loan. 

Income is commission based but I’m approximated to make about 120k this year. I went to see a financial advisor at my bank but they’re minimum investment is 25k which I found pretty high. I don’t feel comfortable investing 1/3 of my money quite yet. 

I plan on opening a Roth IRA in January once I find out my complete annual 2021 income. I am contributing 7% to my 401k also through my job. I want my 7-10k investment to be safe, slow, and steady growth and also liquid. I can’t lock it up and want to be able to pull it out at any time.

Looking to invest in Index Funds in the EU. I am looking for Accumulating ETFs and so far I kind filtered it out to the following ones:

* iShares Core MSCI World UCITS ETF USD (Acc) - IWDA
* iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS ETF USD (Acc) - CSPX
* iShares Core MSCI Europe UCITS ETF EUR (Acc) - IMAE
* iShares MSCI EM UCITS ETF USD (Acc) - IEMA

I see that the S&P500 ETF one has had better returns over the last 5 years than the MSCI World ETF, however it is less diversied.

My question is: as I am quite risk-averse, does it make more sense to buy separately the S&P500, Emerging and Europe ETFs or simply buy the MSCI World one and call it a day?

I'm seeing -4%, but with BLNK the thing that concerns me about that sort of name is that I see people all the time with like 10-15-20% positions because they ""believe"" in EVs; the problem with belief like that is it can lead to ""buy at any price"" hype like you saw last year with anything EV-related, even the worst, most ridiculous names and a lot of the hype has come out of these names.

I have a position in CHPT, but it's a very small position that may gradually become a larger position over time as I see how the business goes.

If these are your only choices, I would stick with your bond fund. Essentially the TIPS in the IP fund are just government securities.

If you are not so confident, but rather a believer, why don‘t you just hold back a part of your money in case there is a crash/correction so you can buy cheap? IMO you can achieve the same thing as with your secured ETFs this way, but you do not have to buy weird/expensive products.

If you google Vanguard + one of these titles you'll find the ticker, they are all on the site. iShares also have similar ETFs, with some following the MSCI index rather than FTSE.

I use iShares for factor investing. They have ETFs for Value, Momentum, Size, Min Vol for the US. They also have ETFs for Value, Momentum, Size Min Vol, and Quality, High Dividend for the World.

I also use some thematic iShares ETFs for themes like Digitization, Robotics, Ageing Population, Healthcare Innovation, Clean Energy.

For alternatives, you can find iShares ETFs for things like Commodities, Gold, Private Equity companies.

113,CD," No. How can something that does not regularly outpace the rate of inflation be a ""hedge"" against it? 

Gold is a store of value. It's like forced savings. If you buy gold via a cryptocurrency like PAXG you can earn some interest on it through places like BlockFi. It will hold some value over time, and maybe even go up in value. But it's nothing I would put more than maybe 1% of my net worth into, and just for diversification purposes. 

Then you have to factor in that when buying gold, you're paying anywhere from 5% or more in premium over spot. Would you make a trade through your broker if it cost you 5%-10% the cost of the asset you're buying or selling? Because that's what you pay when it comes to gold. Put another way, you buy gold, you're immediately 5%-10% in the hole. It's even worse with silver right now. Like 20% over spot on some products last I checked on Money Metals. 

Gold is best as a collectible, or for something decorative. If you want to buy an American Gold Eagle or something, go ahead. But it's not a hedge against inflation. It's not even an investment, really. It's like a CD in that it won't really grow, but will keep your money static to a degree.",rockmeamathanos,1,/r/investing/comments/ojklot/is_gold_not_a_hedge_against_inflation/h531sip/,0.04,0.825,0.136,0.9623

115,CC," > Or do they have to be sold at a lower premium?

That's the reason. CCs are not dividends and you should not expect CC ETFs to distribute stable yields. CC premiums are based on IV of options and you can track this with VIX, which tracks the volatility of SPX. So if VIX spikes then you would expect higher yields from covered calls, but if VIX goes down like it has been for the past year, then yields from CCs will also fall.",tachyonvelocity,3,/r/investing/comments/ojj3cd/why_did_the_jepi_dividend_decrease_since_2020/h5259zi/,0.019,0.925,0.057,0.5023
116,CC," Why does IV determine CC premiums?  Is it because options are more attractive when future price movement is viewed as less stable (i.e. the chance to buy at a specific price is more valuable when prices might swing wildly?)

edit: does that also mean that a fund based on CC's like JEPI would be a good hedge against volatility, or are there other risks for a fund like this when volatility is high?",pragmojo,1,/r/investing/comments/ojj3cd/why_did_the_jepi_dividend_decrease_since_2020/h526acc/,0.026,0.744,0.231,0.9416
117,CC," Funds that write CCs can be a hedge against volatility because it will outperform when the underlying goes down. However there are also big problems because these ETFs are attempting to attract investors that might not have the knowledge or time to write their own CCs as a hedge as an active strategy. They are advertised as implementing CCs as a passive strategy which I think is the biggest problem with these funds. Because of this passive strategy, they actually do poorly during volatile periods. This is because higher CC premiums are not free money and come at the cost of future upward movement. If there is a large correction, it might be problematic to write CCs on an underlying that has already corrected since you would basically be locking in losses. So in the case of a passive CCs strategy, you would actually be bearish on the underlying no matter how much the underlying had gone down.",tachyonvelocity,2,/r/investing/comments/ojj3cd/why_did_the_jepi_dividend_decrease_since_2020/h529bir/,0.095,0.835,0.07,-0.7353
