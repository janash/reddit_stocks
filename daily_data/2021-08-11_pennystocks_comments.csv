1,SESN," SESN has a PDUFA coming up next week, and looks likely their bladder cancer treatment Vicineum (based on a fusion protein delivery system) will end up being approved. This drug will in all likelihood completely replace use of Keytruda in bladder cancer patients, which would put an enormous dent in Merck's pocketbook. They also suspect it's applicable to head and neck cancer, and are beginning trials, also a market where Keytruda is approved.

P3 results show Vicineum being dramatically better tolerated by patients, because it is targeted only at bladder cells via their fusion protein delivery mechanism. This type of specific tissue targeting is a game changer in cancer treatment, and is leaps and bounds ahead of treatments like Chemo, that impact the entire body. Thus side effects are greatly reduced, and you also typically get better end patient outcomes (beyond just the reduced side effects) because the drug is delivered to the targeted area more effectively.

So not only have they proven success with their fusion protein technique, but they are also on the precipice of knocking a huge chunk of revenue out from a major player. This smells like a buyout to me, and I'm predicting a bidding war between Merck and at least 1 other large player. Their leadership is also full of ex-Merck, and they recently had a high profile hire in Peter Honig, who was working on the vaccine program at Pfizer, and also is ex-Merck.

They're predicting between a $1bn-$3bn TAM for Vicineum. If they even hit the low end of that spectrum (likely for a cancer treatment that's better tolerated and has better outcomes) we would almost assuredly be looking at a $5bn valuation minimum, which is about 8x current levels. I would expect an early buyout, within the next 6-12 months, to be right around that $5bn price tag, but could go higher if there is a bidding war, as the company also has a tech platform and pipeline beyond this single likely blockbuster. Dilution is a risk, but even if they diluted 50%-100% from current levels, we could still be looking at a 10 bagger with a buyout, or if Vicineum sales are on the higher end of the TAM.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - New cancer drug, incredible P3 results and basically a slam dunk for approval, buyout extremely likely in the next year. 5-10x potential, or more.",BallsOfStonk,11,/r/pennystocks/comments/p1zmde/thread_what_are_some_of_the_biggest_penny_stock/h8hr9xl/,0.102,0.806,0.093,-0.8291

Another poster (credit to /u/regularautostock) on their board wrote up a breakdown of the recent major news that all broke in the last week.  TLDR: positive topline results for ARDS study, full enrollment for stroke study, partnership with Helios

Full post:

It has been a whirlwind of significantly positive news for Athersys that have simultaneously de-risked this investment while also in my opinion increased the company‚Äôs long term potential and added greater clarity around near term milestones.

In my opinion, the reward for this investment has never outweighed the risk as much as it does following the major recent announcements of the positive topline data from the One-Bridge Study for Multistem for ARDS, Full Enrollment for the TREASURE Stroke Study and the new Commercial Partnership between Athersys and Healios.

I greatly commend the leadership and staff at Athersys and Healios for this progress and these accomplishments! This is all hard and important work on behalf of patients in need globally.

These significant positive recent developments have been covered nicely by other posters on this board so I will not rehash them in detail rather I will share my DD and opinion of what they mean for the company moving forward:

Major breakthrough in ARDS and transitioning Athersys to a commercial company: I viewed the topline results of the One-Bridge study as a major milestone for Athersys creating a clear pathway for Multistem to be approved for its first indication in Japan. With Hardy indicating an application for approval is likely to be submitted at the end of 2021 or early 2022 there is now a near term timeline to commercial activity and revenue. These advancements in Japan would support the eventual expansion of the ARDS program in the U.S., Europe and beyond. While our ARDS program is not exclusive to COVID-19 the Delta variant may well increase the need for an ARDS treatment globally indefinitely. In short, if the only indication Multistem could ever treat was ARDS I think this would be an incredibly successful company and investment. However, I believe ARDS will be the first of several indications Multistem is eventually approved to treat.

Bullish Activity in ADVANCE of topline Stroke results expected in Q4 2021: I am deeply encouraged by the recent actions of Hardy and Athersys Leadership. In my opinion on Monday‚Äôs conference call BJ gave the clearest picture yet of where partnership discussions stand - they are talking with multiple parties and even after positive ARDS data they expect to wait until AFTER Stroke data before striking the ‚Äúright deal‚Äù. In addition, Athersys appears to continue to actively avoid a buyout from Healios twice extending the standstill provision in the last six months to now prevent a buyout until at least 2023. From Healios perspective, they agreed to a major new commercial partnership which appears to include based on the information shared thus far a fundamental restructuring of the roles and required investment in Japan for Multistem with Healios now shouldering the operational burden and Athersys in a clear support role. BJ on multiple occasions during Monday‚Äôs conference call referenced that Athersys could now redirect resources elsewhere now that Healios was essentially taking the lead in Japan (a restructuring of roles I view as greatly beneficial to both companies). Healios‚Äô clear desire for greater control of, investment in, and benefit from Multistem in Japan including potentially adding two new indications BEFORE stroke data speaks volumes to me. Put another way, Athersys parted ways with its founder six months ago, is being led by an interim CEO and a Board with a variety of new Directors. Could there be a more textbook situation for a company to be for sale or willing to strike any deal that could pass as reasonable? However,Athersys Leadership appears to be contractually preventing a buyout from its main partner and listening to offers but deciding to wait for a profoundly binary event (Stroke data) before accepting a deal. To me the meaningful business decisions of both companies in the run up to Stroke data exudes a bullish sentiment on which direction they believe the data will go. All of this leaves out the intriguing speculation that Healios and maybe Athersys as well has an understanding of the Stroke data already if in fact enrollment was completed early this year and some of it has been unblinded already as part of the application / analysis process.

As of this post, Athersys is being undervalued by the market: To make this point succinctly, Athersys the owner of Multistem is at near 52 week lows. Healios, a partner that has a commercial agreement for Multistem for limited indications exclusively in Japan is near 52 week highs. I think investors are appropriately valuing Healios and dramatically undervaluing Athersys. I also think the firehose nature of the recent major pieces of good news has yet to be understood or valued by the market. The last three business days have in my opinion dramatically changed the risk (greatly lowered) and reward (greatly increased) for an investment in Athersys. However this news has all come out on top of each other, without any major PR fanfare to date like an investor conference and comes on the heels of almost six months of negative investor sentiment and share price action (including dilution). However, we are here now and I do believe the share price will begin to reflect the fundamentally positive changes in Athersys‚Äô current standing and future opportunities that have been revealed since late last week.

In conclusion, there are countless risks to any investment like Athersys and in Athersys specifically. However, I would argue that risk is inherent if you are seeking a blockbuster return on your investment. So too is having conviction in a company and an investment BEFORE it is loved by the market and sees an appropriately valued share price.

While not guaranteed,I believe Athersys has a tremendous opportunity to be valued lightyears more than it is today and in the last three business days this asymmetrical investment has been structurally de-risked while having its upside expanded through tangible near term opportunities.

Another poster (credit to /u/regularautostock) on their board wrote up a breakdown of the recent major news that all broke in the last week.  TLDR: positive topline results for ARDS study, full enrollment for stroke study, partnership with Helios

Full post:

It has been a whirlwind of significantly positive news for Athersys that have simultaneously de-risked this investment while also in my opinion increased the company‚Äôs long term potential and added greater clarity around near term milestones.

In my opinion, the reward for this investment has never outweighed the risk as much as it does following the major recent announcements of the positive topline data from the One-Bridge Study for Multistem for ARDS, Full Enrollment for the TREASURE Stroke Study and the new Commercial Partnership between Athersys and Healios.

I greatly commend the leadership and staff at Athersys and Healios for this progress and these accomplishments! This is all hard and important work on behalf of patients in need globally.

These significant positive recent developments have been covered nicely by other posters on this board so I will not rehash them in detail rather I will share my DD and opinion of what they mean for the company moving forward:

Major breakthrough in ARDS and transitioning Athersys to a commercial company: I viewed the topline results of the One-Bridge study as a major milestone for Athersys creating a clear pathway for Multistem to be approved for its first indication in Japan. With Hardy indicating an application for approval is likely to be submitted at the end of 2021 or early 2022 there is now a near term timeline to commercial activity and revenue. These advancements in Japan would support the eventual expansion of the ARDS program in the U.S., Europe and beyond. While our ARDS program is not exclusive to COVID-19 the Delta variant may well increase the need for an ARDS treatment globally indefinitely. In short, if the only indication Multistem could ever treat was ARDS I think this would be an incredibly successful company and investment. However, I believe ARDS will be the first of several indications Multistem is eventually approved to treat.

Bullish Activity in ADVANCE of topline Stroke results expected in Q4 2021: I am deeply encouraged by the recent actions of Hardy and Athersys Leadership. In my opinion on Monday‚Äôs conference call BJ gave the clearest picture yet of where partnership discussions stand - they are talking with multiple parties and even after positive ARDS data they expect to wait until AFTER Stroke data before striking the ‚Äúright deal‚Äù. In addition, Athersys appears to continue to actively avoid a buyout from Healios twice extending the standstill provision in the last six months to now prevent a buyout until at least 2023. From Healios perspective, they agreed to a major new commercial partnership which appears to include based on the information shared thus far a fundamental restructuring of the roles and required investment in Japan for Multistem with Healios now shouldering the operational burden and Athersys in a clear support role. BJ on multiple occasions during Monday‚Äôs conference call referenced that Athersys could now redirect resources elsewhere now that Healios was essentially taking the lead in Japan (a restructuring of roles I view as greatly beneficial to both companies). Healios‚Äô clear desire for greater control of, investment in, and benefit from Multistem in Japan including potentially adding two new indications BEFORE stroke data speaks volumes to me. Put another way, Athersys parted ways with its founder six months ago, is being led by an interim CEO and a Board with a variety of new Directors.

It is a stock that has been completely ignored by all the big pumpers, and very misunderstood by most. A lot think it is just another auto parts reseller. THEY ARE WRONG! They are launching an e-commerce platform that will revolutionize the way auto-parts are bought and sold online. 

To explain a little, think ETSY or FTCH, both are niche platforms for sellers to sell very products within very specific guidelines. This is what FLES will be but for auto-parts. You may ask how will they compete with Rock-Auto 1AAutoparts carparts.com or parts ID. The answer is, they won't. Again they are not selling auto-parts, they are a platform that those sellers can use as well as any manufacturer distributor or re-seller large or small. PRTS already sells their JC Whitney line on eBay, ID also sells their parts on eBay as well as summit racing and many others. This will be an additional channel more focused on auto parts that will allow better margins mainly due to lower commissions but will also allow a better buying and selling experience all around.

They are partnered with a large e-commerce development firm, Commerce Pundit, as well as big auto parts data providers and inventory management software companies.

The site is tentatively scheduled to launch 8/25/2021. They have released a demo of some of the site pages revealing some of the features it will provide, including will call pickup at local auto parts store, get it installed option at checkout as well as a B2B wholesale program for auto repair shops to source parts from some of the largest distributors.

This will be an additional channel more focused on auto parts that will allow better margins mainly due to lower commissions but will also allow a better buying and selling experience all around.

It is a stock that has been completely ignored by all the big pumpers, and very misunderstood by most. A lot think it is just another auto parts reseller. THEY ARE WRONG! They are launching an e-commerce platform that will revolutionize the way auto-parts are bought and sold online. 

To explain a little, think ETSY or FTCH, both are niche platforms for sellers to sell very products within very specific guidelines. This is what FLES will be but for auto-parts. You may ask how will they compete with Rock-Auto 1AAutoparts carparts.com or parts ID. The answer is, they won't.

CVS is rumored to be in their sales pipeline and expecting an announcement that speaks to that soon. 

They manufacture and sell autonomous security that guarantees customers results and savings over human use. They have a subscription base model which is super exciting.

Im just answering the question - but I guarantee we're back in the 0.06 range shortly and much, much higher in the next 5 years. A possible bit of dilution is the current worry, but 1.

105,TD," The company itself seems like they are working on becoming pink current by September to meet the deadline, but some online brokers are planning to prevent buying at the end of the week. It seems that TD Ameritrade may be pushing their deadline back to the end of August, and that may be the reason for today's price spike.

The company itself doesn't seem overly concerned with meeting the deadlines set out by the online brokers planning to restrict trading earlier than September. They have positive upcoming catalysts, but it frustrates me that they are not rushing to get off the restricted trading lists as soon a possible.",MeowStreetBets,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/p24wbl/the_loungedaily_plays_august_11_2021/h8k8yh0/,0.089,0.846,0.065,-0.5927
106,TD," I have no idea. It stated on the TD Ameritrade article part of the article states ‚ÄúWith this special dividend, Drone Guarder is rewarding its common and preferred shareholders for their diligence as the company pursued a restructuring program designed to unburden itself from the decisions of its previous management. Drone Guarder was recently acquired by Video River Networks and is in the process of becoming current with OTC Market regulations. The company's new CEO Frank Igwealor said, ""We believe it is productive to reward faithful and loyal shareholders with additional shares of the company at this time.""‚Äù End paragraph from the article.",TinyHands6996,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/p24wbl/the_loungedaily_plays_august_11_2021/h8k5zxg/,0.019,0.82,0.161,0.9453
107,TD," It looks like TD Ameritrade is pushing their deadline back to September I guess that there's more time for people to buy and sell the stock now. There were some pretty large sell orders between 0.0089 to 0.0090 that were being slowly chewed away near the end of the day.

I'm waiting to see what happens in the after market and tomorrow, but my poorly timed buy a week ago at 0.0090 is making me hope it goes up a bit more. There is almost a 40% difference between the lowest and highest prices of the day, so there's some crazy volatility going on that I'm missing out on. Though at least I may potentially manage to avoid being a bag holder at this rate lol
