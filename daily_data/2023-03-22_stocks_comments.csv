0,VS," So can someone give me pros and cons of hike being where it is VS higher? From casual reading I feel like it was better to keep it higher for at least a few more months because things still don’t look good, but what are the arguments against that? If we go too soft won’t things either get worse or stay worse for a longer time? I want to make sure I have enough info from both sides.

26,OP," Former bank auditor here.

What OP might be talking about is unrealized losses sitting in thr fixed income portfolio. Since banks have fixed income e.g. bonds, the rates on these securities are lower than the current market rate as these securities were issued during low interest rate environments. There's obviously a variable portion of the interest rate tied to a benchmark e.g. LIBOR, EIBOR, CFOR but it's not comparable to thr current interest rate environment.

If there's a loss of confidence in the bank, people will withdraw their deposits / investment portfolio. Obviously the banks (not SVB but bigger banks e.g. JPM) do stress tests (CCAR), liquidity / capital sensitivity tests to ensure that they have enough liquid assets to pay people pulling money out. However, in the adverse scenario that more people / institutions pull out money that anticipated, the bank will have to sell their fixed income portfolio (the ones with lower interest rates) and realize the losses. This in turn will eat into their capital and investors will lose confidence thereby turning into a vicious cycle.

Just to note not only will the fixed income portfolio that is in the 100s of billions be dumped onto thr market, but other banks will follow thereby crashing the debt market (which is far far larger than any equity market). This is why the fed provided liquidity. It's not really the depositors pulling money they're scared of but the fixed incomes being dumped onto the open market.

What's funny about all this is that people call insurance companies frauds but insurers wrote down their fixed income portfolio to account for exactly this because their actuaries / risk management forced them. Banks did not realize the losses.",LordFaquaad,37,/r/stocks/comments/11yibyy/lending_markets_are_telling_us_stocks_are_about/jd8tq5b/,0.172,0.73,0.098,-0.9753

> So the coal production is owned by a different spin-off company, EVR, who will pay some royalty that ends up coming out to about 90% of EVR's free cash flow. There is a $7B cap or 5 year cap on the royalties, though, whichever comes first. As the Twitter author points out, why on earth would you invest in EVR over Teck given that Teck is basically snagging all of the FCF of EVR for 5 years. EVR also grants Teck some preferred shares.

43,FCF," > [Here is a Twitter thread about Teck's met coal spin-off](https://twitter.com/puppyeh1/status/1628001918881787904). To quote one of the replies:
> 
> > This structure seems a way to capture all the economics of owning a cash stream from coal without institutional esg holders getting dinged for owning a coal name.
> 
> So the coal production is owned by a different spin-off company, EVR, who will pay some royalty that ends up coming out to about 90% of EVR's free cash flow. There is a $7B cap or 5 year cap on the royalties, though, whichever comes first. As the Twitter author points out, why on earth would you invest in EVR over Teck given that Teck is basically snagging all of the FCF of EVR for 5 years. EVR also grants Teck some preferred shares.

> A convoluted accounting exercise to sell coal without selling it.

The best part is that coal commands premium pricing right now, and the parent (copper) company will get royalties off it. I'm actually bullish (met) coal, just would rather play other options besides Teck.

Negative news since late last year as far as production goes.

The stock is priced to be the absolute winner of the AI race in terms of being the dominant chip maker. If that expectation fades for any reason, the stock will fall. 

Hell, I think as soon as AI hype fades, NVDA will fall even if they remain the dominant chip maker.

Yes, I am short NVDA by shorting calls, call spreads, and longing put spreads.

127,PR," I don't think showing the cold hard truth would be detrimental. Having success in the markets makes that ever more satisfying knowing to a degree the odds you are against. And making newbies more cautious would be like the tide that lifts all boats as those who get badly burn will never come back to stocks or options. Some for the rest of their lives.

It's not rocket science to publish weekly or even daily the amount of accounts in the red vs. green while keeping the users anonymous. Or the traffic and how the distribution of trades is... which could show that a fraction of the users generate the majority of the volume. For crypto exchange it is a well known fact that a small minority of miners are responsible for most of the integrity of the network due to the inherent transparency of the blockchain. I would't be surprised to see the same in SEC supervised exchanges.

Unless the government mandates it I see this info as always obfuscated. Probably to generate FOMO and customers based on a few and rare success stories. Like that highly publicized story of the option trader that turned $700 into 100k+. Never mind for each one of these there's a LOT of others who lost it all.

Exchanges and brokers work for their self interest after all. And the same PR was probably peddled to nuke pension plans while mitigating the fact a bear market can dissolve decades of a 401k accumulation in a matter of weeks that can then take years to recoup.
