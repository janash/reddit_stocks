0,DD," Just to add on some more info for those who might not have been following: 

Today at 7:45pm PT (that’s why everyone is still awake lol) the city of Fernley, NV approved ABML’s CUP with a 7-0 vote. This is a strong endorsement from the city Planning Committee to the City Council for final approval on June 16th with no issues or objections raised. The facility will produce 50 jobs for the city.

The plant is expected to be up and running by Q4 of this year and expected to be generating revenue by Q1 2022. The pilot plant is anticipated to have a throughput of 20k mT per year and generate a revenue of ~$180M per year. 

ABML has 0 debt and has applied for and is currently awaiting approval for uplisting to NASDAQ. Notable investors in ABML include CNBC’s Jon Najarian who is an advisor (but not on the board). 

ABML currently holds contracts with the worlds 2 largest chemical companies, sits on the US Department of Energy’s advisory board, and has a research partnership with the University of Nevada. 

IMO: anything under $2 is still a great entry

20,HUGE," ABML

HUGE NEWS - Fernley, NV’s Planning Committee approved ABML’s conditional use permit at last night’s committee meeting (May 12).  The committee voted 7-0 to approve with enthusiastic support. 
 
This is a MAJOR milestone for the company as the entire permit process is the last hurdle to clear before the company can begin construction on a pilot plant.  This facility will process 20K mT (metric tons) per year of recycled material with anticipated revenues > $150M and margins > 65%.
 
Please note:  this is not the final approval, but the general consensus is that the Planning Committee’s endorsement will allow this to pass the City Council meeting with flying colors on June 16th.  
 
Construction is projected to begin once all permits are approved (after the City Council meeting on Jun 16th) and will be completed before end of the calendar year, Q4 2021.  Black mass production and revenue generation in Q1 of 2022.  ABTC has plans to build additional commercial plants with substantially larger capacity in future years.

46,ARE," One of the biggest mistakes I made in the beginning was to not look at the charts. Right on your broker's page for the stock should be a little chart. Click on it, and switch it to the 5-day, 1-month, and 3-month view. If the stock has gone up a lot in that time, you're too late to buy. If the stock is on its way down, and you believe in it, put it on your Watch List (like a favorites page), and wait for a low point before buying in.


Penny stocks aren't really great for investing. They're for trading. Very few are worth holding on to for long. Most will be just a few days to a few weeks, and you won't make huge profits. At the small budget level (where I am, too), making $10 off of a trade is pretty good. You just keep doing it as often as you can, and the money will slowly build up.


You ARE going to lose money. You're especially going to lose it in the beginning.

63,HUGE," $ABML - HUGE NEWS

Fernley, NV’s Planning Committee approved ABML’s conditional use permit at tonight’s committee meeting (May 12).
 
This is a MAJOR milestone for the company as the entire permit process is the last hurdle to clear before the company can begin construction on a pilot plant.  This facility will process 20K mT (metric tons) per year of recycled material with anticipated revenues > $150M and margins > 65%.
 
Please note:  this is not the final approval, but the general consensus is that the Planning Committee’s endorsement will allow this to pass the City Council meeting with flying colors on June 16th.  
 
Construction is projected to begin once all permits are approved (after the City Council meeting on Jun 16th) and will be completed before end of the calendar year, Q4 2021.  Black mass production and revenue generation in Q1 of 2022.  ABTC has plans to build additional commercial plants with substantially larger capacity in future years.

ETA:  video of the Planning Committee meeting now on YouTube.

I'm not a bag holder and don't want to coerce anyone to buy in, do your own DD. But I honestly think it will hit $0.10 once it goes current, which is why I didn't sell initially (which I do regret).
