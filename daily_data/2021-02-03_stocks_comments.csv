This GME thing only made this blatantly obvious, because Wall Street is fighting without caring about collateral damage. But this happens everyday with all kind of topics.

Did the restriction of trade by the small time brokers play to the benefit of the institutional short sellers? probably. 

Is that evidence of malevolence on their part? No, on any highly volatile stock the market needs to minimize counter party risk. It just so happens all the rocket and moon people were on a crappily capitalized startup instead of a real broker. (Though that may be too harsh, imagine if everyone was instead on Vanguard/Schwab/TDA/Fidelity I bet something similar may have happened, though maybe delayed by a few days.)

Look, I empathize with the feeling of wanting to stick it to Wall Street and to feel a belonging with that group. I've been saying this for the last decade: the GCF/Great Recession/Hidden Depression hurt a lot of poor and middle class families and their lack of recovery is averaged out by the better than expected recovery of richer families. This has led to a lot of extremist populism, blame being shifted to external parties  (immigrants, China, Iran, etc.) by the government and the press.

39,GME," My personal take on the matter is that the more this has been going the more people are starting to make some fairly egregious assumptions. Way too many unknown variables at this point compared to how it used to be when this whole movement started and considering the current price; this is an extremly high risk play and is straight up gambling-.

Could it go up? I certainly think that there are still scenarios in which it could. Could it crash? Absolutely. I don't think there is any way to tell because there is a lack of information regarding the shorts and what price they are positioned at.

So yes, I disagree with the thesis that you present in ur TLDR, that the short squeeze should still happen; not only do you base that on some conspiracy theories but you are also assuming to be knowing of the mental state of most retail investors; that they don't care if this won't go down to 0. 

On the flipside, I also disagree with the sentiment that this is 100% done and that GME will never go up again, because I do think there is a world in which a bigger short squeeze could occur.

51,PS," Well... I don't really see, where are ""higher highs, and lower lows""... My interpretation is as follows:

1. Shorts targeted dips. I think they've got tipped by RH and knew what will happen.
2. Now the price is being held by the keepers, but... I think that it will drop more in the following days.
3. I think that  squeeze itself is mainly about the momentum. It was on our side till last Thursday. In my opinion - Main squeeze happened then, and was artificially shut down by trade ban, selling and all the other manipulation going on. There are some screens of people selling for 2k $ and so on. I honestly think, that target price last Thursday could be \~1k, but... It wasn't. We got played out and they did what they wanted.
4. What I think speaks against the next squeeze is the fact, that people can hold, but newcomers can't buy (previously they could). This, again,  works against the momentum. And thinking, that not many people sold on 350+, who bought on the beginning is not a good assumption.

PS2. I don't think reentering now is a good idea. Cool to hold for people who bought in around \~20$ or below (or as you said - you already sold a lot of positions with nice profit as I guess, so... You can try).

PS3. For me - there are too many unknowns to determine the play here. Honestly, without any short info - this is just a casino.

54,GME," Here's the part where you lost me:

> Now, before I get into the rest I want to address something: the fundamentals.

> There is a disturbing echo chamber around the idea that GameStop is a dying brick and mortar retailer and there is no chance at survival. That is simply not the case. I don't want to do a full GME DD here because this is about the second incoming squeeze. However, let me put it to you this way:

> If you were told that a new company was IPO'ing and it was coming to the market with an infrastructure, new talented team, 50 million customers and their plan was to become an e-commerce company to compete with Amazon; their plans for the physical locations was to be game-centric, a place for e-sports to compete, desktop building kiosks, and the newest systems and physical copies of games for those who still love having a physical copy. Not just that, but this company already has revenue share deals with Microsoft and other bigwig companies.

> Knowing all that information would you be interested in this company? My answer is an easy yes. The thing with digital transformation and companies changing direction is people get so lost in what the company used to be they can't see what the company is planning on becoming. If this was a brand new company that Ryan Cohen was leading with the same exact model people would be all over the concept.

...what exactly does Gamestop itself have to do with their stock price? Its been one of the key things to understand about this mess, that the stock price is massively inflated as a result of the short squeeze, and does not at all reflect the actual value of the company.

Yes, the intended new direction for Gamestop is certainly more likely to result in a long-term healthy company than the dying retail market, and I hope that they can pull it off. But the stock's value hasn't reached anything resembling a point of stability since the squeeze began, there's no reason to believe that the stock's value has even the most remote correlation with the company's prospects as a whole, and only a complete fool would buy into the stock right now based on what the company's actually doing.",Wraithfighter,1,/r/stocks/comments/lbuhp0/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_2/glwtljk/,0.049,0.829,0.122,0.9816

The exact reason they already told everyone that is both likely and matches a bunch of other online brokerages who ran into the same issue.  Regulatory requirements for capital to offset high volatility trades.  Today is the first day in how long that volatility wasn't massive and totally out of whack with normal market action.

111,SI," How will you squeeze shorts that probably got in at the top? SI went from 138% to 120% to 50% something. All the bleeders got out on Thursday and Friday and the rest that are left are those that either don't care/got in at the top. How do you squeeze that? Bring the price to 1000 through holding? Volume went down because everyone that likes money sold.

Most of the peeps that are left bought high and don't want to sell low so they created some QAnon-esque echo chamber on r/wsb that repeats stuff about ""short ladder attacks"" and ""fighting the suits"". Just look at the sub and try to tell me that those people are not delusional. They don't know what OTM, ITM, put, call means yet try to come up with some crazy ideas how it's now going to moon.

Every time the price goes down it's a ladder attack and every time it goes up it's a rocket. There was ""support"" at 350, 220, 130, 110, 100, 90. Doesn't seem like good support if you ask me.

r/wsb looks and feels like the front page of r/leopardsatemyface after 6th Jan when QAnons found out that it was a fiasco and Trump left them holding the bags.

If you can afford to lose money, cool. If not, just cut your losses and give it up or stick around for a few years and maybe Cohen & co will turn the company around.

112,RH," Many feel very cheated at the squeeze right now exactly for this reason, it's no coincidence the crash started happening, the second Robinhood started to put limits on orders. Based on momentum, it was easily on the road to hit over $500, but the second RH restricted trades, by logic, if no one can buy, then of course prices will crash. Many feel that drop from almost $500 down to slightly over $100 was when they were able to cover many of their shorts. 

It likely caused a lot of people to panic sell, others that sold to move to other brokerages, and of course with that comes more crashing. While options being exercised and buying was supposed to go up towards the end of the week into the beginning of this week, it simply wasn't enough to cover for that damage from RH, and even to this day there are still restrictions. 

The emotions many are feeling are not just about losses, but also how it happened, since we basically downloaded and spent time using an app, that eventually turned on us to block out trading, and regardless of brokerage, everyone shared the same market, when it started going down, thus helping to bail the enemy or hedge funds out of their situation.",LifeInAction,140,/r/stocks/comments/lbuhp0/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_2/glwj8z2/,0.145,0.805,0.05,-0.9757

129,EFT," I did see comments from people saying they are transferring brokerages, and I agree with their reasoning.  What Robinhood and the other brokerages did limiting trades is ridiculous.  With that being said, transfers are going to take more than a couple days.  I was replying to people who were transferring to Fidelity in hopes they can setup their accounts and trade the same day, but Fidelity has been limiting the pace to link a bank account for EFT transfers.  I setup to link both my checking and savings from two different banks, yet the savings account EFT link still hasn't been approved.  With the checking account linked, I was luckily able to transfer funds and trade the same day even while the funds hadn't settled.

Long Story Short, I'm tryna grow my account starting from 1K$. Been trading since late december and reached 2K$.

I sadly went 1K$ wednesday before close @ 26$/s, hoping for a nice run over the after-hours like the previous days but it all fell apart. I then joined the day after with another 1K$ @ 15$/s, bring the average down to 20$/s. but shits hit the fan and now I'm fucking down like 50%. 

Guys, do you think I should accept the lost and get out and invest in other stocks... or should I wait till it comes back.

My goal is to grow an account to be able to daytrade. Sadly, I'm all-in and got no more chips to play..

I thought the same - not entirely sure why BB was ever seen as a meme stock.

I actually think for similar reasons along with Nokia they’re good for the long haul, albeit Nokia still actually makes solid budget phones.

Usually stocks don't retreat back to their previous previous support line, unless something has gone horribly wrong. They set new support and resistance lines, when they break previous resistance lines.

I'm already on board with ACB as of last March, but it was only recently that they started doing better enough for me to hold off on selling. I'm leaning towards an ETF like MSOS (all US) or YOLO (more than just US) because there's so many fucking companies that I'd rather just shove my money into an ETF to worry about all the buying/selling for me, but some people have told me the cannabis stock game is more an individual stock pick if anything. Still unsure. That being said, APHA would be the company I'd choose if I was to invest in a single cannabis company. Don't know much about any other competition.

328,AMC," 1. My bad I was looking at the google stock ticker as I was too lazy to open my RH app and you are right. It hit $25 before market closed at 4:00 but it did reach $28.77 so it was very close to $30. But again remember, it reached it in a healthy upward momentum during a time where AMC, GME, BB all blew up. Also a time where BBBY also blew up. This ""without any problems"" mentality needs to be taken with an asterisk because the ""without any problems"" part was because they all rose during this time and it was also when the entire market crashed outside of these 4 stocks.
2. I agree, a lot of people who put in money to BB or heard about BB for the first time thought it was still a phone company. I've seen some posts in this subreddit and /r/stocks that had people saying ""buy BB"" and talking about it as a phone company and I was like these guys really have no idea what they're talking about. A month ago, I thought it was still a phone company before I did my research...

I think it is a risk at the current price of $12 because of the exact reasons you just stated. The image is hurt because people think it is a phone company for starters. Then other people think it is a meme stock. And some other people think it is an overvalued company. Everything you listed about it makes a lot of sense and trust me, I had the same mentality and notion. But again, my mindset was going in when it was a $7 stock. 

Now it is a $12 stock. You say 6B market cap is nothing for what they sell, but that's the bullish mindset. I'm saying that the bullish mindset is fine but just know that there are a lot of risks with it. A lot more risks at $12 a stock than at $7 a stock. I am keeping it in my watch list and was very high on it when it was $7 a stock, but at the current price it does scare me. We need a lot of things to go right for Blackberry to take off and regain its footing and be a great long term investment (thinking $15-20 a stock range minimum) but we also can have one or two things go against it and completely crash the stock. And at the $12 range, that scares me a lot more than the bullish side.

BB right now seems to survive DUE to its partnerships. Standing alone, it just doesn't seem to have enough legs to really take off. And that scares me. It did a great job with the partnership with Amazon and that really drove it up from the $4-5 range to the $7-8 range... but now it is at the $12 range and the Amazon partnership alone won't keep it there. The best thing that can happen with BB IMHO is for it to be acquired by a big company but putting a lot of long term investment money in a company in hopes that it gets a great partnership or gets acquired is a big risk. I'm not saying it is a stock that will fail, but I am saying you need to really assess the risk vs reward of this stock",tomackze,1,/r/stocks/comments/lb92ma/blackberry_dd/glvjgqy/,0.081,0.818,0.101,0.9384

I think it is a risk at the current price of $12 because of the exact reasons you just stated. The image is hurt because people think it is a phone company for starters. Then other people think it is a meme stock. And some other people think it is an overvalued company. Everything you listed about it makes a lot of sense and trust me, I had the same mentality and notion. But again, my mindset was going in when it was a $7 stock. 

Now it is a $12 stock. You say 6B market cap is nothing for what they sell, but that's the bullish mindset. I'm saying that the bullish mindset is fine but just know that there are a lot of risks with it. A lot more risks at $12 a stock than at $7 a stock. I am keeping it in my watch list and was very high on it when it was $7 a stock, but at the current price it does scare me. We need a lot of things to go right for Blackberry to take off and regain its footing and be a great long term investment (thinking $15-20 a stock range minimum) but we also can have one or two things go against it and completely crash the stock. And at the $12 range, that scares me a lot more than the bullish side.

BB right now seems to survive DUE to its partnerships. Standing alone, it just doesn't seem to have enough legs to really take off. And that scares me. It did a great job with the partnership with Amazon and that really drove it up from the $4-5 range to the $7-8 range... but now it is at the $12 range and the Amazon partnership alone won't keep it there. The best thing that can happen with BB IMHO is for it to be acquired by a big company but putting a lot of long term investment money in a company in hopes that it gets a great partnership or gets acquired is a big risk. I'm not saying it is a stock that will fail, but I am saying you need to really assess the risk vs reward of this stock",tomackze,1,/r/stocks/comments/lb92ma/blackberry_dd/glvjgqy/,0.081,0.818,0.101,0.9384

Looking back, when RH throttled buying on Thursday that should have been my clear sign to GTFO but hindsight is 20/20. I ended up getting out at an average cost of $140 which still allowed me to cover my initial costs and make $8k in profits but it's definitely disappointing knowing I could have made over $30k if I had stuck to my original plan.

>Wall Street isn't some conglomerate. There are probably other hedge funds who haven't shorted gamestop. Who instantly saw blood in the water, with access to tons of data and more sophisticated tools to get a clearer picture of sentiment. Knowing that a horde of emotional retail investors, were mass buying and holding GME. So they decided to ride the wave, and now it's possible that they're pulling out, leaving the retail investor as the one holding the bag.

How can you say that Hedgefunds that have a ton of data and tools that **we dont have** got a clearer picture to profit off this and in the same paragraph say that they decided to ride the wave and is possible theyre pulling out? According to yourself you would not have the data or tools to even make that opinion. 


Whats happening right now is people are losing a lot of trust in the markets because of all the illegal shit that Wall Street is getting away with right now. They basically told us that they will bend the rules until they win, so a lot of people don't have confidence in the market right now. Especially not people who paper hands.

You are mad at CNBC because they were worried retail investors didn't really have a grasp of the fundamentals and didn't realize this was the eventual outcome no matter how high it might have gotten.

I get the silver thing sort of but that is them trying to find a narrative for movement which is all they ever do and bots were posting SLV all over reddit, but you just expect them to realize it was bots and not real users when most of them probably never have used reddit.

There is a difference between supporting retail investors and their ability to take on hedge funds and also worrying that newbie retail investors who don't understand what is happening would get carried away and end up holding the bag while more sophisticated ones actually make the money which is what happened.  If you look at WSB right now and see what it has become, you should see it.  DFV took 15MM in profit.  The smart ones know that GME cannot support this valuation which is all CNBC was trying to get across.

You should take your winnings as a retail investor precisely because the odds are stacked against you the more you try and beat the big guns and Cramer knows this from first hand experience.

I'm not saying Cramer is a hero.  But whether he had an ulterior motive or not, his advice was correct.  It's what people with no skin in this game would have told you as well. 

But essentially people refused to take advice from someone they suspected (not without reason) had a conflict of interest in favor of advice from people they 100% knew had a position in the stock and a vested interest in maintaining a high price.

Cramer did not screw you over.  People telling you that GME was going to the moon and not to sell (while they sold) and left you holding the bag screwed you over.  If you sold when Cramer said to, you'd be better off now.

423,GME," >  It's one thing to underperform the market but -53% is definitely a way to get booted.

It's important that you understand that Melvin Capital is not actually down 53%. It's possible that one of their 15-20 strategies is down that amount, but the firm as a whole is absolutely not down anywhere near that. Since the source of the 53% number is from Andrew Sorkin, based on a phone call he had with Gabe Plotkin, it's a pretty fair bet that he was explained losses in one or a couple of strategies, and erroneously assumed it was applicable to the fund. 

The belief in the industry is that Melvin is down somewhere between 5% and 10% in January, and almost all of that is due to liquidating bad long positions, not due to shorting GME.

For one thing, because they weren't actually short in GME. If you look at their most recent [13F filing](https://fintel.io/i13f/melvin-capital-management-lp/2020-09-30-0), the only position Melvin Capital held in GME was a put option worth somewhere around $55 million. [That's their only disclosed holding in GME at all](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme/melvin-capital-management-lp). There's no doubt that option expired at 0 value, but that's not a big loss to them.

Among many other reasons, if Melvin *had* been down 53% in a month, the firm would have been dead. That would have blocked all other finance institutions from making any deals with them, because their risk management would be deemed collapsed.

Moreover, the fact that that Point 72 and Citadel made a cash infusion by means of a revenue sharing agreement means that both of those counterparty desks not only considered Melvin to be solid, but to be expected to make a positive return for the year.

Again, as above, if Melvin Capital had been down 53%, Point 72 and Citadel literally *couldn't* have made that infusion.

It's also important that you understand that no hedge fund is holding unhedged shorts. So whichever hedge funds *did* have short positions in GME also had corresponding hedges. All hedge funds operate on the basis of flow trading. What flow trading means is that you're essentially holding balanced short and long positions in all equity you're invested in, and you only start shifting towards either long or short when specific market events trigger that as a reasonable move. 

**With that being said**, you can be pretty damn sure that every short-focused hedge fund (including Melvin Capital) has been buying shorts in GME when the price has been hovering around $200 to $400 a share. What that essentially means is that every single dollar retail investors are putting into GME now is going *straight into the pockets* of those hedge funds.

I know enough hedge fund managers these days that are literally laughing their asses off from this squeeze attempt. This was a pump and dump that made a handful of early adopters in WSB a few million, and beyond that it's been a transfer of billions of dollars from retail investors to hedge funds. 

Let's be clear about one thing. WSB deciding they're going to beat hedge funds ""at their own game"" is about as reasonable as me thinking I'm going to beat LeBron in a game of Twenty-One. I might score a bucket or two when his guard is down, but there ain't a snowball's chance in hell I'll win the game.",10b-5,1,/r/stocks/comments/lbh1kl/i_honestly_think_jim_cramer_was_right_when_he/glwctoa/,0.076,0.822,0.102,0.9298

It's good to hear this ended well for a few people though. I definitely agree with learning to read a balance sheet.

443,GME," One thing for sure in my case is that I learnt a lot about trading due to GME. 

Till now my approach has been to buy a stock or 2 and forget my login creds. Log back after months.

I have been active for last 3-4 months. What I have learnt during gme is more valuable than money made. I think this has given me more knowledge on reading balance sheet, how to use limits, how to devise an exit plan, level 2 quotes, how to see volume traded, how does extended hours work. How the whole world trades. All this stuff about margin accounts,  shorting.

444,GME, I mean they weren't wrong. And reading balance sheets won't matter with GME. This was never a play on their great future promise. GMEs fair value increased from 5 dollars yes.. but the only reason it trades above 30 is simply due to the short squeeze that's it,xEternex,1,/r/stocks/comments/lb7r9n/gme_taught_me_the_importance_of_being_independent/gltioto/,0.051,0.734,0.216,0.7447

Then something unjust or at least questionable happened with it being halted times and times again, culminating with brokers actually putting a stop on buying all together. Then, obviously a lot were left holding bags, and then again big players piled in shorting it to oblivion.

I regret not selling when RH and other brokers stopped the ability to buy the stock. It was a clear and obvious sign of what was going to happen next.

447,AMC," Couple thoughts here from a WSB degen who’s main philosophy is value investing. I did DD on GameStop for months, jumped in around $17 upped my cost to around $24 so I had a lot of wiggle room relatively speaking. I did cash in, not like DFV but I made a solid salary in a handful of weeks by the time I got out, which admittedly so was still too late. IMO the long term for the company is something I still believe in (right or wrong that’s for you to decide). I also believe there is still an outside shot at a squeeze to some level and am prepared to hop back in if it looks to be happening. And I will definitely be buying back in for the long term once the stock settles down because I do believe in Cohen and Fis Ame for the long term. It’s brick and mortar retail and could absolutely go bust, but I’m fairly young and can withstand the variance. 

Having said all this, I do think the hype went too far. The HF just don’t lose long term. They can lie, cheat, steal, and whatever other illegal maneuvers they have at their disposal all the way until the end. Looking at the clear ladder attacks and charts of both AMC and GME it’s pretty clear there is absolutely foul play at hand and the theory behind the short squeeze maneuver was and still is correct (in my belief) but when you are playing in a play field with no rules theory goes out the window unfortunately. I do think GME was still a solid play at $100+ the plus being what you defined your own risk to be, mine would have been around $185, but you had to have an exit strategy and be able to identify when enough was enough for you. Anything into the 200s and especially approaching $300 I would have said stay away.

Even, quite regrettably, staying in too long I still cleared ~90k in a matter of weeks which I fear is going to be an anomaly compared to the rest of the retail investors who made the play and are left holding the bag.

If it launches I’ll be back in and if it tanks I’ll be back in for the long haul (5-10 years minimum). Do your own work and make your own decisions, just my two cents on the entire GME situation.

Edit: if this thing gets laddered back down all the way to $17-20 I’m tossing at least 40k at it in hopes of a yolo moon shot, but more importantly I believe in the new structure and ideology of the company moving forward.

Ended up up with 40 @ $96.  I sold half at 400 just to make sure I wouldn't lose anything, and also end up ahead in case it crashed.

After the Robinhood stint, I didn't feel quite right about the situation, so I sold 10 more at 325.

Then I decided to see what happened on Monday, so I held my last 10, and sold them at 225 once it was clear the prices were on a steady downhill slide.

 I took half the money I made and put it into AARK ETF, and trying to figure out what I want to do with the rest.

This was the first time I'd entered the American market, so I'm really happy with how it turned out.",crystalshannonm,25,/r/stocks/comments/lb7r9n/gme_taught_me_the_importance_of_being_independent/glt4ouy/,0.029,0.881,0.089,0.759
481,DD," I think this was the downfall for many here, as a long term investor, I normally make buy strategies, but rarely ever a sell strategy, so this really was my 1st time with this. I thankfully got in early, right around the mid to upper 2-digits, also based on the actual DD with Ryan Cohen, eCommerce plans for the future, the potential short squeeze sealed the deal. 

The downfall was I was actually going to swing trade this and sell at $100, but then as soon as it kept going up, I figured maybe I should hold longer. It actually was smart, since I knew people that actually did sell at $100, but then fomoed on the way up to $400. 
My next goal was to leave at $500, which it never reached during actual trading hours, which led me to hold all the way until slightly above $100s I sold and cashed out. Essentially broke even, took home a couple $100s, but considering how many $1000s were inside if I had exited last week, really leads to lots of emotion. 

Think the biggest lesson and difference between long term investing and trading is how much you have to learn defense as much as offense, to protect yourself and DCA selling, as much as buying. Had I learned this, I probably would've already sold, regardless of the situation, once it hit 5x my investments, but instead I held through to the end. Guess this is why trading is incredibly difficult, since you have to deal with things coming from both sides and at very fast pace speed as well.

487,ARE," I'm cashing out tomorrow with more of a loss than I'm willing to admit. I do pretty good diligence in the stocks I invest in, if not just refrain from purchasing random stocks and rather in companies I actually believe in.

I had actually been following $GME ever since it was around $30-$40 and it gave me a good laugh. A friend and my brother messaged me about it a week later when it was around $70. I always make the joke, when regular people start messaging me about something I've known about for a while, that's probably a top indicator. I bought 1 share around $80 (<0.05% of my portfolio) just so I could track the price but never had any intention of buying.

As the price kept going up, I bought a bit more at $150 (maybe 5%), then finally put a big bag (around 40%) in around $250. Super uncharacteristic of me. I told myself wow this could blow up, but that usually means I'm too late (historically speaking). This one time I actually did buy into the hype for some reason. I never buy options because they are in my opinion, just straight up gambling, but when my friend kept pestering me and saying hey I bought an option for $1k and it's worth $50k, now I bought. I had ample opportunity to exit with a very small profit and leave this for the people who like day trading. I set a stop loss, and when it hit (5 minutes later) I bought back in.

It sucks to say, but I made my bed and now I'm lying in it. In the back of my mind, everything that I was doing was categorically what I told myself I'd never do and even after multiple chances to exit in the green or (slight red), I denied them either because of peer pressure or populism. I think I was a bit frustrated because the market been kind of wonky lately and I felt like fundamental trades I was making were just not performing as well as they should've. But, as much as I would like to blame others, I can't. Nobody forced me to do this--it was just a very expensive lesson.

Regarding r/wallstreetbets. I agree with most of the posts here. I followed for the memes and never once planned on making a trade based on any information there. It's fun to see people and their huge wins, but I always understood those were the outliers and realistically most people just post loss porn on there. With all the being said, the state of that subreddit scares me. Now, it's pretty much a cult and any differing opinion on there seems to be suppressed because it doesn't hit the diamond hand narrative. There is so much information not only on Reddit, but in the news that should raise some red flags of any rational investor. I'm not sure what I would do if I was u/DeepFuckingValue. Like many have said, he was ridiculed in the beginning, but now that he is still posting his loss porn, people are holding on to that one sliver of hope and refusing to sell--people that probably have a cost basis of $400, not $20. I get it to a certain extent, if you've already lost 90% what's the point of selling the other 10%, but I just hope that people can make these decisions by themselves and not be pressured by the mob. I'm a grown ass adule, but damn I never thought I would have let my friend persuade me like this (on me, not him).

In any regard, I hope that people that were burned by this weren't hurt too bad and can take this as a very valuable lesson. If you made money, all the more power to you--wish I was there with you! For beginner investors, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD ONLY INVEST WHAT YOU ARE PREPARED TO LOSE. MORE IMPORTANTLY, DO NOT LIE TO YOURSELF REGARDING THE AMOUNT YOU ARE *ACTUALLY* WILLING TO LOSE. It's a lot different to say I'm okay with losing $X and actually seeing $X gone from your account.

I was aware of the risk I was taking, I didn't bankrupt myself--but boy does it suck going from 120% returns to only 30% over the last year. Please be careful out there.

531,SI," Honestly, it is a bit strange that they've suddenly thrown a new metric in. BUT, they make a point for doing this, which I think is reasonable. And they were transparent in doing so. Go look at their Twitter. They threw in the new metric because the short float % doesn't take into account the shorted longs. That is, the shares that short sellers have sold to others. In reality, those should be accounted for as shorts can buy those as well as any of the original shares they borrowed.

The way it's usually explained is that the shorts must return the shares to the rightful owner, but there's nothing stopping the original owner from selling their share while it's borrowed. The short holder could just as easily buy the share they borrowed from the original owner as they could buy it from the one he sold the borrowed share to.

Besides that, they are reporting the actual shorts have decreased, down to ~27M shares now. There is no way to invalidate this. There are no other metrics on SI that are up to date. Volume is a bad argument for shorts not being covered.

532,TD," Absolutely agreed on all points here. That was the big ticket. The short squeeze coupled with the gamma squeeze. Alas, it seems the short squeeze was cut short (no pun intended) by numerous brokers shutting down demand by limiting or outright preventing buying. It wasn't just Robinhood that did this, mind you. They were at the forefront because I do believe most retail investors use it, and they didn't handle the heat very well. Webull limited trades on it, Etrade did as well. Hell, even TD Ameritrade did for a time period, among others.

I think if anything in all of this deserves investigation, it's these brokers. They had a huge impact on the outcome since this coincidently happened around the time of the spike, which is presumably when the shorts covered. But, they've laid out a reasoning that does have merit. Is it 100% truthful? Probably. This will shake the financial sector if not. Should they get off scott free? Not sure. I am by no means an expert on law or even trading for that matter. But, a class action has been filed and consumers have a very legitimate complaint. I wouldn't expect much more than a settlement out of it though.

The chances of a further squeeze look bleak. A lot of people have sold at this point, and as mentioned in the other comment, shorts appear to have covered largely. There is still a large short position, but many of those shorts could be at a higher cost basis around $200-$300 for all we know. To put it simply, it would be much harder to trigger another squeeze. The first one was a sure bet because we knew the shorts were at a low price.",Spaghetti-hoes,5,/r/stocks/comments/lb7r9n/gme_taught_me_the_importance_of_being_independent/gltbx65/,0.074,0.873,0.053,-0.6328

Every instinct alarm bell started going off when RH started restricting trades. I followed my gut and sold everything, but then re-purchased after getting swept away by hype on WSB. Started realizing over the weekend that the sub was really beginning to sound cultish and knew I had made a huge mistake. 

I’d like to think I’m a smart person in general, but this was definitely a humbling wake-up call, a reminder to trust my instincts when there are red flags everywhere, and to be careful not to get swept up in hype.

I had read about stocks for years, knew my fundamentals. Then my friend told me about GME back in September, I did not buy in, it exploded and FOMO hit me harder than Tyson could have.

594,GME," Bro, I don't know if you'll read this but I just feel like getting this out here as I resonated deeply with how you feel right now.  


I got into investing just right during the March dip, and it was one of the best timing ever. Most of the stocks I bought just went up. The market is so bullish and I feel very proud and confident of my skills and achievements. I started diving deep into the markets, trying to figure out the best way to make the most money in the shortest amount of time. I discovered about leveraged products and I was making >200% in less than 6 months, way above my initial expectations of 20% per annum. Making money in the market seems so easy.

Then the tide starts to turn. I got cocky and I was leveraging myself more and more. One day a selldown happens and I lost big. Back then I would have cut my losses, but since I am in huge profits, I decided to just hold on, hoping for a rebound. The stock is slowly forming a downtrend, but I ignore everything and kept looking for confirmation bias to strengthen my conviction in holding. Before I knew I was down so much that my entire profit is wiped out in addition to some losses of capital. Imagine flying to the moon and dropping back to the ground. It truly is a feeling that's hard to get over.

But slowly, I begin to realise that this is exactly the best thing that could've happen to me. When you're young and not afraid to lost it all. When you don't have any commitments.  I could've gotten lucky and continue to double my account without knowing anything, but one single mistake and I will be back to zero in no time. It's not how much you make, but how much you can keep.

 The fact that you're feeling bad right now is a sign that you're learning and growing. Every successful person goes through period of losses and pain. It's just part of the process. But trust me, as long as you do not give up, you'll eventually succeed. And listen up, you'll continue to make stupid decisions like that in the future. You would've thought that my journey is smooth after that huge loss, but in fact I was also caught in this GME hype because of a friend that triggers my FOMO. But this time I don't lost as much. I still bleed, but lesser. I have been constantly beating myself up too this few days for being a retard even after the first loss. Guess I will take this as my second most expensive lesson in the market. Thinking on the bright side, I am losing less now, which is a good sign haha.

Just know that it's okay to make mistakes. Some people got to their goals faster, some slower, but everybody losses once in a while along the way. This is the price you have to pay, you can't win if you don't know how to lose. What's more important is how you act after all these expensive lessons. So cheer up, you can easily make back that money in the future, slowly but surely.

Last but not least, just remember that money isn't everything. You're not valued by how much you have in your bank account. In times like this, it's better to close your trading app, go out and take a walk, or just try doing something relaxing. After all, life is still good.

2. don't take financial advice from TV financial editorials. They're wrong much of the time.

Both are not geared to your investment strategy. Jim Cramer has admitted many times his show is more for day traders, which I am not.  I have watch lists for stuff sometimes mentioned but that's it.

602,GME," I love WSB. I am fully supportive of what's going on and this may make me biased, however I am going to try to give level headed advice.

I am pretty heavily invested into GME however it is money earned from just playing the market. Essentially money that I don't mind losing. I have a price average of 192. Not as bad as some people that have a price average of 420.69 (nice) but my price avergae could be lower. I do believe it's going to go back up. Up to how much?

I don't know. No one knows.

But I get what you mean. I believe right now every meme stock is essentially a coin flip. I think it's healthy to look at both sides of the coin and decide which side to play with.

When thinking about it this way why would you bet against the house?

And yet WSB did it anyway. And they caused turmoil that has not been seen before. And from what I can tell a majority of the sub is still going strong with GME although it is clear that right now things aren't looking hot for both WSB and The House (Hedgefunds). I genuinely believe that right now it is a war of who can last longer. 

There's no way to know who will get what they want. One side has to pay who knows how much daily interest, and one side is a bunch of individuals that have the attention span of a goldfish. There's just no telling how this goes until it's fully over.

The way I see it right now I have to be comfortable with losing all of the money I have in the market, but in this specific situation GME. Because to me the market is like the ocean. 

The ocean has high and low tides. Sometimes you get caught riding the wave down, sometimes you catch the ocean going up. There are no guarantees that this will go back up to $500 but there are also no guarantees it will go back to $4, although going down is usually easier than going up.

Remember that there are always red days. Not every move is a banger, otherwise everyone would have invested in the stock market. 

""Think of this as a learning tuition"" is a really repeated phrase, but it's true. Some people are going to learn what it means to board a spaceship too late, and other's may get lucky and save this lesson for another day. 

You have to trust your gut on this one. Do what you believe is best for you.

If you don't want to lose the $1500 that you have left in the account then sell. No one can blame you for trying to save your account. It's a lot easier to build up an account from $1,500 than from $0.

607,GME," It's Ok, you described what I feel exactly.
I started trading about a year ago, poured in some of my savings and bought stock, especially during the mass dip from March last year.

After a bit of documentation, I bought stock that I felt and believed will re-bounce easily and return to at least their previous value by the end of the year. I had about 120% return by the end of 2020, cashed in on some but still have a good chunk of the stocks opened, since I believe there is still room for growth.
I didn't invest any massive amounts of money, about 2000$, and was happy with my choices.

Then I let myself down with the emotional and financial intelligence of a poop throwing monkey at a burning Zoo and hopped in on the GME craziness, relatively late, at around 70$, but bought both up and down like a brain washed ape. Didn't invest much, about 1/4 of my last year's earnings, very tolerable, but atm I am on a negative on GME and can't believe it was so easy to go apeshit on this.

But, since the loss is not massive for my finances, I am trying to turn this around in the coming months.

I am holding, no sense to sell now, in my opinion. Waiting for the fire to go down. I am planning to average down once the stock dips to normal values or below, but it all depends on one thing, on the one player which stayed silent until now: Gamespot.

If Gamespot is able to profit from the current surge of interest and potential cult following, if they are able to reorganize their business in a way that makes them a real competitor on the market, I might, with a bit of timing and study, to turn this around into profit. Not the ""$69000 is not a meme"", might not even go back above 250 in the following year or two, but if I manage a 20-30% ROI after one year, maximum two, I wouldn't argue.

A part of me is upset, because I could have put it in my roth, a part of me is not because I messed up so much (I think i bought at margins) that I would never have learned if I didn't take the risk and failed.

I ALWAYS wanted to buy in the stock market outside of retirement, and I feel that I learned a lot and there is a lot I have to learn. My dad told me never to get into day trading because you will ""lose your ass off.""

I'm a millennial that got hit with so many market recessions since a kid, so a part me is really ""f the system."" At the same time, again, I'm happy I learned about the markets through failure. I will probably make up for this buy cutting back expenses and putting the money that I lost back into the account maybe next month. Maybe. I have to figure out what to do with the margins lol

As far as the other stocks, i'm just going to leave it in for now to avoid a bigger hit with the capital gains tax.

Edit: I actually wanted to make like 1k profit so I could donate it to my college (not the school the department where I majored). So, I'm trying to figure out what to do. May just replenish the lost amount and donate the money. Trying to figure everything out right now lol

650,AT," A few things... 

- If you're emotional about a trade AT ALL... don't trade it. Simple as that. Boring trades will make you more money in the long run. 

- Always have an entry/exit plan. I had friends buy GME and i asked them 'what's your exit' to which they had no answer. They didn't even place stop loss/limit sells and had no strategy for making money whatsoever. This is not the way to do it. 

- Treat every trade like a poker hand. Once it's over, erase it from your memory. If you sold for a 10% profit and it could have been a 50% profit... You still won, you still made money. Don't chase. Shoulda, woulda, coulda will never make you money. A gain is a gain. 

- Always have a diverse safety net. Should one of your trades blow up (like GME), you've got something to fall back on and never trade anything you're not comfortable losing. 

- Invest in companies with strong balance sheets and fundamentals and you'll have a hard time losing money. 

Although you lost in this case, you probably learned most valuable lesson you'll learn as it relates to the market. Consider it tuition.

I actually just now realize that I have been shadowbanned there for making [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb1vhi/saw_18_mil_profit_and_said_nah_im_not_fucking/glt4ej4/):

661,GME," Greed, fear, lust. We’re all human. We’re all susceptible. There’s a reason mass hysteria has happened over and over again. There have been so many bubbles in history and hyped up stocks are not a new thing (go back 100yrs to the 1920s). There’s a reason cults are possible. 

The main thing is learning from it. I lost a bunch going short for too long when the market crashed in March last year and there was another WSB echo chamber supporting me at the time (though no where near as bad as now. Then lots continued to argue the bear case but a lot quickly switched correctly to the bull side). I stayed in for too long with a short position.

But I learned from it. So this time with GME I only risked an amount I could comfortably lose. I was +300% at one point and didn’t sell. But got out at +70% gain because as soon as I could tell the market was going to dump I got out immediately.

665,GME," Yes sell, then don’t look at the ticker again for a long time. Step away. Your happiness/mental health shouldn’t be connected to the movement in the price of a stock. I had huge anxiety when I held on to a losing position that I wasn’t sure would improve. Being on the red for a stock where you believe there’s a good chance it will go up is different. DVF held for 1yr plus, sometimes through negative, because he had conviction that it was undervalued and once it was >$4+ he was making money. If you’re holding a negative position that you’re not confident in and think likely to get worse much much better to sell. Cut your losses and move on.

Edit to say also remember:

1) the amount you lost actually isn’t that much in the context of your whole life. 

2) this lesson will teach you better risk management & money management and what your risk tolerance is 

3) however much money you have you can always lose it all if you don’t learn to manage your feelings. There are plenty of billionaires/millionaires who have lost their entire fortune by going all in to something risky or mismanaging their spending. Lots of famous sportsmen/actors in particular who have lost it all because they get rich quickly and don’t know what to do. Lots of people lost money with Bernie Maddof because he paid a consistent 30% every year (somethings can be too good to be true).

You seem sensible and have the right approach to be a great investor. When I lost money in March I had been very risk averse until then. So felt deep shame about losing money that way. Didn’t feel like myself. I also missed out on the big bull run after as couldn’t bring myself to touch a stock or anything again. Until I dipped my toe in GME never expecting it to blow up like that. So sell, take a break, regroup. Come up with a clear plan and stick to it. You will lose money again trading, as well as gaining.

666,GME," I didn’t say it was my first loss. My first loss was back in March last year when I held a short position too long after the market started coming back up.

GME for me was a gain. But like a lot of people I regret not cashing out earlier to make more but,  that’s natural. Greed is why I didn’t sell earlier.

669,GME," Luckily there are plenty of smaller communities that are moderated well or are small enough that they need no moderation. If not for those places, I would have no interest in Reddit. The popular stuff here does not appeal to me at all. It's also fairly clear that most political discussion is manipulated, either through social engineering or with bots/paid shills.  
  
I've been thinking even more about the shadowbanning. It not only keeps /r/WSB focused 100% and continues their narrative, but for some people, will have the opposite effect. Some people who are shadowbanned might simply decide that WSB completely scammed them and that they should cut their losses and sell. They are being reasonable in questioning the overarching narrative, so clearly WSB is unreasonable, and the opposite of their narrative must be true. Therefore, it's wise to sell, because there will be no short squeeze. WSB made it up as a ""pump and dump"" scheme. Such a simple action that has a double effect: indoctrinating more people into the main narrative, and potentially funneling others into an opposite narrative.  
  
No matter what the truth is, we're being played in both directions. Nothing on WSB can be taken at face value (especially the ""loss porn"" posts involving millions of dollars), but that doesn't mean that everything there is false. I'm starting to realize how complex the propaganda/misinformation on the internet is, and I think that lesson was worth the $150 I've ""lost"" on GME.  
  
And the result of that lesson is to be careful about how the internet affects me.

* **BB - BUY LONG**  
Bought BBerry before all the hype... sold it at 20$ with big profit... but I'll go back soon as the hype settles. I trust that the CEO Jason Chen can pivot this ship into a new direction. I was a fan since the BB10 days and still am. I don't know why but i just love the company and what its history. You have to also remember that their QNX is implemented **EVERYWHERE -** most car manufacturers are using it, most of the G20 countries implemented it... so in a long run i would bet on BBerry.
* **PLUG POWER  - HOLD or wait on the dip**  
I bought them on 10$ mark and sold already couple of times. At this point they went up fast and i would like to see price dip a little bit before getting in to have some maneuvering space. With Biden administration going for green energy i am positive it's going to move in 2021. Take it for a long run but expect volatility.

This whole GME/AMC meme stock fiasco wasn't investing, it was gambling.  You can and should invest money you're not willing to lose.  You basically have to invest that majority of your net worth otherwise you get destroyed by inflation.

815,GME," On number 4...

Is that advice still a good rule to follow today? If one has been investing based on fundamentals the past 6 months, they've most assuredly lost money, or at least haven't made any money.

I'm sure you'd agree it isn't a good idea to go against the market. Right now, the market is saying fundamentals don't matter. We are in pure risk on speculation mode. Before, 'speculation' might mean thinking 6-12 months from now. But today, people are thinking 10 years from now.

Momentum trading appears to be the easiest path to success at the moment.

Which brings me to number 10...I don't think it's that binary. Just know what you're doing and have reasonable expectations. One could have jumped on GME when it was around $200 and made a huge return, even if it was just straight stock purchases.

816,IMO," Great advice. Here's a few more I'd add:

\- Regularly read books on finance/investing. Yes, you can now learn everything in these books on the internet, but IMO reading books from cover to cover is still important to ensure that you have a balanced perspective on the market. The first book I've ever read on this topic was Tobias' *The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need*, and it was incredibly helpful for developing my investment philosophy. Another book I've heard good things about, although haven't read, is *The Bogleheads Guide to Investing*. There are many other good books - read them.

\- If you're from the US and lost money on stocks this year, remember to look into tax loss harvesting. It won't get rid of the sting of losing money, but should help alleviate the pain.

\- By far the most important investment you'll make is in your own psychology. Take time to understand how stock movements drive your emotions, and how your emotions drive your decision making. 

\- Learn about dollar cost averaging and understand that ""time in the market beats timing the market"", especially for diversified funds like ETFs. Utilizing these two points correctly alone, which isn't hard to do, can yield incredible results over time.",jxsn50st,10,/r/stocks/comments/lbjgjw/its_amazing_how_many_people_jumped_in_headfirst/glv9exe/,0.068,0.797,0.135,0.9329

818,GME," In reply to your broad comment about people jumping into the deep end without knowing how to swim: I am one of those people, though considering that I bought one share at $250, maybe that isn't what you mean by ""deep end."" But it feels that way to me--it's an amount I can afford to lose, but to me it *is* a lot of money. What feels like the ""deep end"" to me is that I am involving myself with a ton of complex stuff that I know nothing about. I am *completely* out of my element and in over my head.  
  
I really do like that, though. I've spent a long time thinking, ""Gee, I really should start investing my money..."" but with no pressure or immediacy to do so. The GME story was interesting and timely, [someone I trust gave me a good summary of it and laid out some reasons for getting involved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAHk1x3XVko), and it sounded like fun to gamble a little, join a group of people, and make an interesting story feel more real.  
  
This has taught me about [propaganda and misinformation on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbgy74/i_went_from_being_super_proud_of_me_to_being/glw22sa/) but has also motivated me to learn more about investing in general *right now*. Not ""maybe tomorrow..."" but *right now*. Is that worth my life savings? Absolutely not. But is that worth $250? Definitely. I'm already up $10 or so in the investments that I thought were wise. And I know how much I dislike feeling like I have to watch stock prices constantly. What a horrible day I had yesterday, glued to GME's price all day long.  
  
As for people who actually *did* risk their life savings on GME--I'd be highly skeptical of their claims. I'm not saying it hasn't happened, but it's pretty easy to say that you did that and to make up ""evidence"" when pushed to.

Now that it is Wednesday/Thursday, people realized they have been bamboozled with their lies of Short Laddering and other shitpost they made up to make the momentum running for Monday and Tuesday. 

I am pretty sure if the memes did not stop coming Thursday/Friday this would had been a overlooked by Monday. 

People tried to do their DD but it was flooded with fake hot takes such as the Short Laddering where hedge fund slowly undercut the stock price so that it would fall and the number of Volume that people were holding where you realized that was just lies to tell people to hold but they allowed them to believe it. 

The mods were an issue to where they allowed these lies to continue and I suspect they got a payout from the hedge funds to let the squeeze of $300 per share shorts to happen.

They also started to build a big growing operation in the North of germany.

Also they scored the rights to grow and sell medical mj in germany as one of less than a handfull companies from the bfarm. Bfarm is the german regulatory analog to US FDA.

936,EVER," I think there are three lessons for you to learn about investing:

* Never, EVER invest more than you can afford to lose. I think all the comments echo this point.
* Never, EVER buy a stock that has spiked as much as $GME stock did in a month. It's called ""Fear of Missing Out"" or FOMO. It means you bought a stock because you see it go up so much that you ""fear you are missing"" an opportunity of making easy money. Don't do that because there will ALWAYS be a correction after a stock has gone up 500% in a month.
* Avoid re-buying more shares of a stock just because you are losing money in it. It's how people go bankrupt. Understand that investing is a lot like gambling. If you lose all your money in a casino, you don't go to the ATM to get more money and try to win it back. It doesn't work. Just reasearch the stock if it is indeed a good time to re-buy.

For long term, I think the better advice is don't try to catch rockets. It's better to miss out on a great investment because you were too late than trying to catch the momentum. Wait for the next one. And to be clear, that doesn't mean avoiding stocks near ATH. It just means that fomoing into a stock will likely backfire.

955,GME," Thank you for finding that typo.

I'm guessing you're genuinely curious how to know when the price gets an increase, so I'll humor you with my personal, uneducated opinion:

-those that know this with confidence either don't exist (because it won't happen) or are not sharing (if it was going to happen)

-if I were to hazard a guess, it would be when huge limit orders get triggered. I don't know what this value would be, but I would assume that it would have to be 150. I have no knowledge of how institutions work, so I don't know their practices.

-if I were to guess more, this would happen for a number of reasons: it would be when the retail investors buy large volumes relative to sales. This may happen at 100 today, for instance. Or never, on any day.

-it is also possible that extrinsic factors such as a confidence boosting announcement (i.e. stimulus) might change how retail/institutions react to all stocks

-its also possible that GME splits the stock or makes an offering, which could trigger large volume buying because the price may be cut in half all of a sudden

971,GME," Here is my postmortem on the last week.

**About me:** I'm a professional 36 year old at a startup in a finance role. I'm a huge believer in the FIRE movement. ""set it and forget it"" has ALWAYS been my motto. Well, we all know what has happened over the last few weeks. Here is what I did and the lesson I learned. 

About 2 weeks ago I started hearing about all the GME grumblings through reddit posts. At first I was really intrigued and I subbed to WSB and a few other investing subs. Then, last Monday I decided I wanted to try my hand at investing. I didn't have a brokerage account, so I went with my gut and opened a RH account. This was Monday evening. It took about 2 days but I was able to transfer $500, essentially my stimulus check, into RH and I bought 1 share of each of the meme stocks. I got GME at about $330. I told my self that I'd get out once it went up a few hundred (lol). Well we all know what happened. I got swept up in the WSB wave and was waiting for the ""**infinite money glitch**"". I swear I saw that phrase more than once and I'm kicking myself for even getting hyped off it. Ugh.

Whatever, after yesterday I sold everything I had on RH and am going to close my account once everything is settled. I was a RH member for about 7 days. 

But, here is the lesson I learned and here is my plan going forward. I'm going to open an account with an ""adult"" broker - Vanguard. First of all, they didn't restrict any trading so good for them. But more importantly, I've read boggleheads and I understand that investing is for the long term. Luckily I didn't gamble anything I couldn't afford to lose so my actual retirement is safe. I'm going to put aside $100 a month into my vanguard account as a way to keep me excited about investing. However, I've come up with some guidelines that I intend to follow:

* Don't invest in anything that I don't anticipate in holding for at least a year. This will keep me focused on the long term and minimize the tax burden.  
* If I read about a stock on any major news site, proceed with caution and tell my self that it's probably too late to make any ""real"" money. If I do decide to get in, I'll set aside a very small amount. This will be my YOLO amount.   
* Do my due diligence. If I want to invest in anything I need to at least spend some time reading about their fundamentals and  come up with a light ""thesis"" on why I think it's a good value. I'm sure I will get this wrong, but at least I can trade with a purpose and then perform postpartum on anything that doesn't go my way.   

Anyway, thanks for listening to my rant. If anything, this past week has really been a cheap lesson on investing.",DankChase,15,/r/stocks/comments/lbiqol/rstocks_daily_discussion_wednesday_feb_03_2021/glv91ir/,0.04,0.846,0.114,0.9894
972,RH," Here is my postmortem on the last week.

**About me:** I'm a professional 36 year old at a startup in a finance role. I'm a huge believer in the FIRE movement. ""set it and forget it"" has ALWAYS been my motto. Well, we all know what has happened over the last few weeks. Here is what I did and the lesson I learned. 

About 2 weeks ago I started hearing about all the GME grumblings through reddit posts. At first I was really intrigued and I subbed to WSB and a few other investing subs. Then, last Monday I decided I wanted to try my hand at investing. I didn't have a brokerage account, so I went with my gut and opened a RH account. This was Monday evening. It took about 2 days but I was able to transfer $500, essentially my stimulus check, into RH and I bought 1 share of each of the meme stocks. I got GME at about $330. I told my self that I'd get out once it went up a few hundred (lol). Well we all know what happened. I got swept up in the WSB wave and was waiting for the ""**infinite money glitch**"". I swear I saw that phrase more than once and I'm kicking myself for even getting hyped off it. Ugh.

Whatever, after yesterday I sold everything I had on RH and am going to close my account once everything is settled. I was a RH member for about 7 days. 

But, here is the lesson I learned and here is my plan going forward. I'm going to open an account with an ""adult"" broker - Vanguard. First of all, they didn't restrict any trading so good for them. But more importantly, I've read boggleheads and I understand that investing is for the long term. Luckily I didn't gamble anything I couldn't afford to lose so my actual retirement is safe. I'm going to put aside $100 a month into my vanguard account as a way to keep me excited about investing. However, I've come up with some guidelines that I intend to follow:

* Don't invest in anything that I don't anticipate in holding for at least a year. This will keep me focused on the long term and minimize the tax burden.  
* If I read about a stock on any major news site, proceed with caution and tell my self that it's probably too late to make any ""real"" money. If I do decide to get in, I'll set aside a very small amount. This will be my YOLO amount.

What money in the world is anyone okay with losing? Imagine if you were mugged by someone and lost your wallet. Or someone broke your car window and you had to pay $200 up front to get it fixed. That would feel shitty. Why wouldn't you feel any anger towards yourself for blowing up your life savings?

 You might be going through a psychological deflection or self-defense because you don't want to admit that you've been brainwashed into a cult, and your portfolio has been decimated because of it. You will never make it if you think your money is okay being wasted. You will never be able to build wealth. You will think of this whenever you are too poor to afford surgery for your pet and have to put them away, or too broke to take out your parents to a nice anniversary dinner.

Remember this. No money should be disposable. We are here to invest, not to gamble.

If you insist that you'd rather die with the stock, then you are in a religious cult. Learn about opportunity cost, and look at Macy's and JC Penney's 20 year chart.

1021,BIG," *Reposting from yesterday for any new eyes:*  


Not making any judgements, nor am I making a prediction on which way GME will go. All I will do is highlight how GME \*could\* be seen as a pyramid scheme, or a reverse funnel in the words of some very wise investors from Philly.

***Signs of a pyramid scheme:***

1. **To make money you will be required to sign up other people:**

Big tick. This short squeeze strategy requires everyone to buy and hold their stock. People are going onto social media and talking to their family, friends, coworkers IRL to get them to buy GME stock. It is also becoming increasingly obvious that there is astro-turfing from both sides, and a lot of effort is being put into controlling the narrative.

**2) The scheme involves selling goods and services of little value:**

No-one would say with a straight face that GME is worth $1000, $500, $200 etc. Even DFV bought in long expecting it to get to maybe $30. But the line is currently '$1000 is the minimum' or 'we literally choose the selling price' despite absolutely no fundamentals to support that.

**3) There will be an upfront joining fee or large initial investment:**

Yep, $30 for the WSB faithful, $300 for the 90% who joined in the past week.

**4) You feel strong pressure to remain in good standing with the group:**

If you hold, you're praised into the depths of financial oblivion - this is love bombing. If you sell for a ten or hundred bagger, you're abused with all manner of names. Anyone who advises against taking part is called a shill or a bot. Any business taking measures to not completely disintegrate is accused of being part of the conspiracy. Any piece of shit can praise the group like Belfort and he's immediately a hero.

**5) There are zero requirements to joining, the opportunity is unmissable:**

Yep. Anyone can open an account and stick their savings into GME. They're told by millions that there's no way this can go wrong, it's free money.

**6) There's a cult-like nature to the in-group:**

BIG yep. All the 'monke' shit, all the 'diamond hands' shit, all the 'DFV is our god' shit. Now you add on the 'this isn't about the money' and it's the biggest sign to me that someone has cultivated GME for a purpose. Step 1: pump money, Step 2: get everyone else involved, Step 3: get out while everyone else is holding, Step 4: they don't know or care what just happened because you convinced them the initial reason to join (make easy money) is unimportant and the real goal was something bigger (stick it to the hedge funds). Note: I am NOT saying DFV or any other individual did this on purpose, but I do think there are big players who haven't come forward and who benefit greatly from having millions of people willing to baghold down to $20.",Barkasia,17,/r/stocks/comments/lbiqol/rstocks_daily_discussion_wednesday_feb_03_2021/glv8hbn/,0.044,0.852,0.104,0.9641

It is also becoming increasingly obvious that there is astro-turfing from both sides, and a lot of effort is being put into controlling the narrative.

**2) The scheme involves selling goods and services of little value:**

No-one would say with a straight face that GME is worth $1000, $500, $200 etc. Even DFV bought in long expecting it to get to maybe $30. But the line is currently '$1000 is the minimum' or 'we literally choose the selling price' despite absolutely no fundamentals to support that.

**3) There will be an upfront joining fee or large initial investment:**

Yep, $30 for the WSB faithful, $300 for the 90% who joined in the past week.

**4) You feel strong pressure to remain in good standing with the group:**

If you hold, you're praised into the depths of financial oblivion - this is love bombing. If you sell for a ten or hundred bagger, you're abused with all manner of names. Anyone who advises against taking part is called a shill or a bot. Any business taking measures to not completely disintegrate is accused of being part of the conspiracy. Any piece of shit can praise the group like Belfort and he's immediately a hero.

**5) There are zero requirements to joining, the opportunity is unmissable:**

Yep. Anyone can open an account and stick their savings into GME. They're told by millions that there's no way this can go wrong, it's free money.

**6) There's a cult-like nature to the in-group:**

BIG yep. All the 'monke' shit, all the 'diamond hands' shit, all the 'DFV is our god' shit. Now you add on the 'this isn't about the money' and it's the biggest sign to me that someone has cultivated GME for a purpose. Step 1: pump money, Step 2: get everyone else involved, Step 3: get out while everyone else is holding, Step 4: they don't know or care what just happened because you convinced them the initial reason to join (make easy money) is unimportant and the real goal was something bigger (stick it to the hedge funds).

1023,IRL," *Reposting from yesterday for any new eyes:*  


Not making any judgements, nor am I making a prediction on which way GME will go. All I will do is highlight how GME \*could\* be seen as a pyramid scheme, or a reverse funnel in the words of some very wise investors from Philly.

***Signs of a pyramid scheme:***

1. **To make money you will be required to sign up other people:**

1024,BIG," What I can’t understand is why DFV is still in. Yes, he has already taken profits to the tune of $13 million. Yet the simple fact is that on Friday he was up another ~50 million. There is a BIG difference between $13 million and $63 million.

Also, yes, his cost base is low enough that he could let this ride down to like $30 and still make a shit ton more. But why? Why do that when he could’ve liquidated everything Monday or Tuesday and still enjoyed another few million rather than just watch the stock slowly crumble? 

Either he still thinks there’s another potential squeeze (I say another because in all likelihood the first squeeze did happen last week), he cares that much about the public perception (sell everything and be the villain), or he’s been photoshopping his posts for the last few days.

1030,FB," I'm curious what other people think about buying stocks based on the news.

- TWTR is a good recent example: After June 8, when Trump was removed from the platform, it fell from around $54 where it had been trading for a week, to a low of $45 a week later (~15%). It has since regained all losses once it moved out of the news cycle (7 days per google). Edit: [this thread on /r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kv2iy4/as_twitter_being_down_over_7_in_ther_premarket_do/) felt too bearish and is yet another good reason to do my own research.
- Something similar happened with Nike after it ran the Colin Kaepernick ads, it fell from $84 to $72, and eventually regained its former value (a little longer for Nike due to non-politically-charged reasons).
- I would add Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal. The news broke over the weekend on March 17, 2018, so FB dropped from 185 at close on Friday to 159 at close on Monday, bottoming at 157 two weeks later. However, it then regained all that lost value (~15%) during the rest of April. The stock did drop a whole lot more in July, and stayed down, on news that revenue growth would be slowing down. 

These are just examples that stand out in my mind. There are others where someone could have made a quick buck based on current events, such as PCG dropping from $8 to $3.80 during the Kincade Fire of 2019, but regaining most of its value even before the fire was out.

I plan to ride my four shares into the ground since there's really no point in selling so low anyways, but I wanted to come to a more rational/level-headed subreddit to ask what you guys think about the future of GME. I've gotten addicted to watching the ticker and was just wondering if there's any possibility whatsoever of this stock ever squeezing and exploding. Some people on WSB still think so, but they're gone full cult and I don't trust anything over there any more, so that's why I've come to [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/).

Do you guys think there's any potential for a squeeze at this point, or should I give up hope and stop looking at the ticker? I just want to know if I should hold onto a small sliver of hope or if I should put this thing to rest and accept that I'm holding $1200 worth of useless stock.

1130,RH," I agree. But I think the initial idea that the squeeze was going to be much higher is still justified. I agree that the squeeze definitely already happened, but I believe it was artificially cut off. It didn’t play out naturally. 

A lot of people are trying to turn the initial play by retail investors of overwhelming the shorts as some pipe dream and was never going to work. I think there was about to be a gamma squeeze on Thursday morning, maybe rolling into the short squeeze many predicted. And I think that if RH hadn’t restricted purchasing power, it would have paid off. 

I think people were very correct about the size of this squeeze leading into Thursday. But the rules of the game changed, resulting in the immediate crash.

Just want to make sure there’s clarification that the reason this turned out the way it did was because of artificial plummets of the price, not because the play that WSB was attempting wasn’t going to work.

You claim that things are cyclical, but history shows that the market goes up. It doesn't show your claim of up years of up cycles, followed by years of down cycles. My only advice to young people, including my adult children, is to start investing early and live within your means. I also suggest investing in ETF's. If you're in your 20's you should invest 5-10% of your income monthly or quarterly in any of the total market ETFs. Set it and forget it.

For example, I won't buy biotech because I don't know enough to decide if it's a good buy. 2. If it's a consumer company, do I like the product? Would I buy it? Also, is it in line with my values. I wouldn't buy tobacco companies, oil, or gaming stocks because I believe their businesses to be a negative to society. 3. How is management? Do the leaders have a good or bad reputation?

Also, one lesson that I learned from GME is that there are no lessons can be learned in such high volume volatile stock. The market change every single hour, and most of the discussions you see in Reddit are outdated second hand misleading information. The hedge funds on the other hand are connected and have more insight than you. Keep this in mind.

It is like the 0 numbers on the casino roulettes. With Hedge fund even 1% better chance than you. They will outrun you in the long term. You may win over hedge fund one time. But the more you play, the more you lose. 

Better case you may win 100%, lose 50%, win 100%, lose 50% again. At the end of the year, like what you say, the profit barely covers the fees. But is it worth the lost of your sleep time.

1217,RH," Feel the same. Had a handful of shares at 17 and a 39c that I got a few months ago as well. If I cashed out at the peak, around 40K gains. Life changing money as I could finish paying my car off, remainder of my student loans, and would’ve had some left for a few months of rent and utilities. 

Got too emotional and hyped as 30-300 was all in the span of a few days. I don’t blame wsb, but more so my mistake for not being rational. It was an echo chamber about how the squeeze hadn’t even begun. It made sense and gave me confirmation bias. And all the posts of people switching brokers and buying more probably made me confident as well

As soon as RH blocked off trades I knew in the back of my head “that’s it, it won’t jump to 1k anymore as the momentum has died out” but still held on for the slight chance. Saw it dip everyday and had many opportunities to cash out but 💎🙌🏻 got the best of me

The weekend really calmed me down and I actually started thinking (for a bit). Eventually cashed out at 150 for around 20K. Still amazing, but I kick myself in the gut every time I see/hear gme.

People still see AMZN, FB, MSFT as the ones who are going to dominate the gaming scene. 9-12 years old, one of their strongest segments, are not going to buy the stock. 

Plus, they're not going to get full revenue from China, TENCENT gets a cut and will be the ones to offer a Chinese version of the platform. This drastically affects my sentiment for them since I'm not sure how the revenue stream will be decided. 

Despite their impressive growth, their audience has a tendency to ""age"" out of the platform and move on to the bigger gaming systems. If they don't have a clear strategy for growing along with their customer base, then I don't see consistent returns from them, it's going to be very rocky.

This 100% kills the momentum when you shut down all trades. Then the stock gets put on the  short sale restrictions list. So you can't short. You can't buy. You can only sell.

Becomes pretty obvious why everyone says the game is rigged and conspiracies are abound. It just shows the massive weakness in the system for retail investors vs institutional and people playing by different rules.

1257,TSLA," It means they are focusing on changing the business model. Cohen is already taking action instead of sitting on his ass. He’s making a shift towards e-commerce and the board is receptive to it. Why shouldn’t the stock go up ? 

Based on your thinking, why would the stock go up when Cohen got elected to the board ? It doesn’t change anything, but THAT’s how equity markets work my friend. Do you think TSLA is valued off of how many cars it sells today ? Of course not, it’s based off of future valuations. Therefore, the rising price is based on the team that Cohen is building.

1285,AMC," I covered the entertainment business (box office, conventions, press junkets) for 20 years and can tell you that theaters are not going anywhere. They will recover. 

While AMC was in worst shape than Cinemark on the financial front, this latest viral push and volatility has helped cover some of the debt that AMC had hanging over them. 

Last year, Insider projections at Cinemark, AMC and Regal suggested that theater traffic would return to pre-covid numbers by Spring of 2022. That eta is probably even better with the push of these vaccines. 

**The Stream Argument:** AAA Directors do not like the idea of people seeing their tent poles for the first time at home with a sound bar.

1371,DD," >NASDAQ:INO inovio is working on replacing cancer surgery by the use of therapeutic vaccines, and is very close to communicate broadly about its success. Inovio is focused on bringing to market DNA medicines to treat and protect people from infectious diseases and cancer.

A technical point. It is unlikely it would replace cancer surgery or even traditional chemo/rads. In fact, if anything it would make cancer surgery more common (or at least as common) as it would take unresectable tumors into resectable territory. For those interested in this space as well both Moderna and BioNTech are also working in this space, though with mRNA based technology rather than DNA-based. Additionally, these likely won’t replace entirely chemotherapy or radiation and will likely be used in concert with them as current immunotherapy drugs like pembrolizumab (PDL1-based) are. Cancer is a sneaky bastard and is really good at hiding from the immune system. And combo approaches are excellent at making it less “sneaky” and makes everything work better as an immunostimulatory rather than immunosuppressive microenvironment.

That said, I think this is a space well worth looking into and doing DD on, since it may very well revolutionize cancer care as much as monoloncals have.

Next time, realize that you don’t need to prove your manhood by letting a 300% return go by because another redditor promised you a 1000% return.

1394,ID," I’ll give my opinion as someone who has been in AdTech for about 7 years at this point -

Magnite is certainly far from the worst public AdTech company and they’re doing *some* forward thinking stuff for the industry, especially around Unified ID 2.0.

But, at the end of the day it is a SSP and ultimately there really isn’t anything that particularly special about it. There was a point a long time ago where SSPs were differentiated by the inventory they had. Due to things like header bidding (publishers can make their inventory available across MANY SSPs instead of just one), that went away. Yeah CTV is a thing but every other SSP is focused on it and it’s not like Magnite offers anything unique there either - they HAD a unique offering for Hulu but no longer the case.

Before Magnite merged - would I have had a bullish outlook on the 2 companies? No lol. 

I’m sure Magnite will keep growing because AdTech as a whole follows TTD in trend as that is the industry darling and powerhouse outside of the massive boys like Google and honestly, I’d buy almost entirely on account of that. If TTD wasn’t public, I’d be amazed if Magnite was anywhere close to its share price now.

1462,DD," Just to play the other side of u/blueminato (no disrespect at all, just want to give both sides of the opinion!)

I think there is a potential for a modest gain off of airline stocks. Yes, u/blueminato is right that the major gains happened already. But take a look at some pre-covid highs of airlines vs the price now. Still a little more room to grow. There are things that have to go right for it to be a nice short term gain though. The Covid Vaccine has to be widely adopted before the 2021 holiday travel season. If that happens, I expect a nice few upticks in the prices. On top of that, people feeling couped up for the last year are going to want to travel (vacations, seeing family across the country, weddings etc.) People who didn't see their families last Christmas are going to feel like they NEED to see their families this Christmas (again, that's if the vaccine rolls out nicely or if covid dangers are dwindling). Once again, though, this is all speculation and largely speculation about human psychology, not hardcore number crunching DD.

One point I have seen to support u/blueminato's opinion is that after covid, business travel may very well be down. I think people are going to travel much less for work than they usually did because telecommuting is now proven viable, and many companies are adopting a permanent WFH structure. Basically those who want to come in to the office can, but those who don't want to don't have to.

1487,AMC," >Also, I believe that AMC will go up again. And no, I'm not delusional. I feel like there are a few reasons. One is that this Reddit frenzy could surge again. Even if it's not right now. Once these trading platforms ease up on the amount of shares we can buy, coupled with the low price of the stock, and also a LOT of scorned Redditors and investors in general, someone may just hatch a plan to try driving the stock price up again out of spite. Not saying it'll happen next week, but it could very well happen at some point. Another reason is that many people believe that AMC has potential to increase its revenue once more vaccines go out and more theaters open

Yikes where you start with this.

1) if every investor on Reddit invested in AMC you would own <0.5% of the shares. A single investment firm changing its outlook on the company to buy/hold would have a bigger affect... Not to mention there can't be another rally as there is no short squeeze motivation. Thousands of other companies would be a better choice for a Reddit rally.

2) let's say cinemas post covid reversed their 30 year decline and magically started being popular again (even though everyone has now adapted and purchased streaming services).

So to find out the real value of the company we have to go back to before it was manipulated when it was at $2.

If by some miracle they can get everyone to start using cinemas again AND they manage to entice a further 20% that never used them to start using them then yes they could justify a price valuation of:

**$2.2**

Think logically not emotionally, you lost money on this but you can make money on other stocks, I have investments with high returns because I've had them for years in popular companies.

1527,DD," I stole this from an article. 

The result of gme shorts being over 100% the float of stock available is due to someone buying the shorted stock that was borrowed, and then having that stock, which was borrowed but is treated as a normal stock, get borrowed again. In theory this could happen multiple times and increase the short % well over 100%.

The article was posted by the Motley Fool on Jan 28th at around 11am.
""Yes a stock can have short interest over 100% - here's how""

The companies heavily shorting gamestop for example are likely out of their positions with gamestop. The reason the short interest could still be over 100% is because people are willing to continue paying their fee's to continue shorting the stock to keep their position valid, and I'm willing to wager that even when the stock was very volatile and trading at $400 people were still shorting the stock knowing that in a year it would be worth less than it was at that moment. This means that the short % while the stock is trading over let's say $200 could still rise as people remain bearish about the future of Gamestop.

The reason gamestop's price went parabolic early last week was because people started to pile on and buy up shares. At the same time big money was trying to keep the price down using whatever methods, short ladders etc. This is what caused so much volatility in gamestop. People were doing their DD and buying into a short squeeze that was ""imminent"" and going to happen on Friday. Big money, I believe, used whatever tactics they could to drive the price down while also buying up stock at the dips in small amounts at a time in order to cover their shorts. 
Either this or they are continuing to bleed out retail investors by driving down the stock price while retail investing hold on to their stocks with diamond hands. 
At this point you are seeing retail investors exhausted financially with the stock, it is very hard for the retail investors to buy the dip when their entire portfolio is in gamestop and they are simply holding. Media is spinning the story of wsb having massive losses at this time because last week retail investors were picking up the stock at prices 2-3 times the value of the stock currently. This creates pressure on retail investors to sell off their positions, or hold off until they are no longer ""holding the bag"".

In my opinion, if you are holding the bag right now AND you can afford to lose the money (you didn't take out a loan and are paying interest, or if you bought X shares of gme at an amount of money can afford to be lost) the best play is to just hold until you start to see some real numbers on the short % and if you see profit on the table, just take it. 

This could play out for a LONG time. This could also potentially play out for just a few days/weeks if we see gamestop hitting low numbers and short positions cash out. 

I believe Gamestop will eventually get very bullish in the distant future if it is still being heavily shorted. Even if Gamestop is not heavily shorted anymore I believe the company has the right leadership to make it an absolute powerhouse in the gaming industry.

DISCLAIMER: I have only been investing for about 6 months, non of this is financial advice, I am just giving my opinion on a situation that is playing out with one particular stock that is heavily shorted and that many people believe is being sold as a naked short. I do not believe anyone is selling naked shorts but I do believe the way that the system currently works may allow a companies stocks to be shorted over 100%.",ModernCivilWar,2,/r/stocks/comments/lb8hrd/in_july_2007_several_companies_tried_to_sue_the/gltowze/,0.035,0.871,0.094,0.9906

This is just my personal view, but I really think Aphria/ Tilray will hit it big, they have secured some deals in Europe already. There are tonnes of different products that can be made in the medical industry. Also beverages, chocolates, candies, smokes, gum.. who knows what else? AAANND don't forget all the peripherals and gear that will be sold alongside! 

Also, modified analogues of the THC molecule would also probably be quicker to get on the market, extracts, hell, counting the hemp that can also be made into clothes and ropes.

Legalization will also make research easier, which will again perhaps pave the way for even better products!

We think it may be 4 to 5 times that number, by extrapolating the Chinese market, which has been the first to adapt, to the rest of the world. I also think that analysts are severely underestimating NIU's ability to scale, drive economies of scale, control the 2wEV supply chain, and penetrate rest of world markets such as Europe and S. America, especially as competitors such as Piaggio, Kymco, Yamaha, Suzuki, Honda and Harley Davidson remain stagnant with respect to electric adoption. They better adapt or die.

**Riding the wave.** Good marketing and branding efforts, well above that of a typical Chinese company. I see this company riding the wave of food, grocery, delivery ramp up. Electric scooters are actually faster and more efficient in urban environments for things like food delivery. I also see improved adoption in the States, in sunbelt cities such as SoCal, Miami, Austin, Phoenix, Atlanta as city planners turn to bike sharing, adoption of new laws (red light filtering, relaxation of licensing requirements etc.) to ease congestion and pollution problems caused by sunbelt migration.

Tesla has solar roofs. A close buddy has a Tesla model-S, and a Tesla roof, and power wall.

Running his AC 24x7 in California, charging his Tesla overnight, both of which would have caused his electric bill to be in the 1000's, was reduced to $10 line charge. He drives 90 miles up/down every day.

Think about this: Tesla is THE energy company of the future. I can see neighborhood solar generation coming about in denser areas, where all rooftops feed into a single neighborhood battery, and the grid only supplies during deficits.

The thing that pisses me off though is they don't really give you a warning when you're going to get hit by the pattern day trader or good faith stuff. I've gotten hit by both of those because they give you a vague warning that you might have problems instead of just saying ""This is strike one of three"" in red letters like it should do.

2. Write down your goals, and be specific. How much money are you looking to invest? For how long? How much are you hoping to make it grow? What's the worst-case scenario that you are comfortable tolerating? This is unbelievably important, because timeline and risk tolerance are what tells you whether a given security is a ""good investment.""
3. Be self-aware. That means quantifying your decisions and opinions. Practice. TD Ameritrade offers a paper-money account which can be great for practice trading, but not necessary if you're on another broker that doesn't offer it. But write down your predictions, and BE SPECIFIC. ""I think stock X will go up or down by Y dollars over Z time."" Write down what made you think that. Set a reminder to make yourself go back and revisit it.
4. When you get ready to buy, do it with a timeline and a worst-case scenario in mind. This helps avoid panic-selling. One of my holdings (HYLN) isn't expected to even start generating revenue for another 18 months, and it's not supposed to be profitable until much later than that.

Oral vaccines are theoretically really helpful with respiratory tract infections, because they primarily trigger a mucosal antibody (IgA) response. If neutralizing, these antibodies can be very effective, especially with covid, rsv, rhinovirus, etc.

1646,CRSR," I bought CRSR when I first started my Robinhood account in January 2021, put in $27 on it and has since started shifting things around and have now invested about $300 in it. I thought it was a nice medium/long term investment as it is a relatively new gaming and hardware stock (even though it has been around for 20+ years, it only went public in 2020). I have also invested $5000 in my IRA onto CRSR.

The pros of it is nice. I like that it is relatively new in gaming but dominating the gaming and hardware market. I also like that Logitech is about 6 times the Market Cap of CRSR so it doesn't need to beat Logitech to make profit, it can just close the gap a bit and we will make a lot of money. I like that they are slowly eliminating their debt and will soon raise a lot of capital. I also like that they have been focused on acquiring other companies, so it seems like an ambitious team that want to dominate the market. All of these factors made me feel confident to put almost $6000 into CRSR. Even though I got in just under $40 a share.

The cons of it is something you need to consider and can't ignore. Motley Fool did an podcast about it and if you don't want to listen, you can just read it through (look it up online). And what they raised is potential long term hurdles that need to be conquered. CRSR already dominate the hardware gaming market with their keyboard, mouse, ram, etc. So what exactly is the growth of them when they are already dominating it? Will they expand to other parts of the market? How will they exactly close the gap against Logitech unless they start focusing on everyday hardware too and also cheaper hardware also. Also will they expand into other aspects of technology too? How big can the gaming department get in general?

&#x200B;

Those are all legitimate concerns with the company, but they're also a company that has done a lot of their own DD in acquiring and partnering with other companies to put them where they are. They have been around for 20+ years but really only blew up in the last 3-5 years. And since then, they have gotten even bigger by taking over the gaming hardware game.

1648,CRON," I'm personally selling my CRSR to jump into another stock (debating CRON, HIMS, and AMBL) here is my reasoning for selling CRSR:  


I do think Corsair is a good to decent Medium term hold. The company has been gaining momentum since 2016 (more 2018 to now) and has benefited tremendously from COVID as, from my observation, a lot of people upgraded their gaming set-ups.   


Therefore, I don't think we'll see great 2021 stock price growth as Q2 and Q3 will not be explosive for the company overall and since I tend to invest in 6-month intervals I am moving out of CRSR.

1665,RKT," So a few things.

1) rates are not 0, you are thinking of the Fed Fund Rate which isn't directly linked to mortgage rates. Mortgage rates are low due to aggressive purchasing of the secondary MBS market. Rates are at historical lows though. 

https://themortgagereports.com/17724/how-mortgage-rates-move-when-the-federal-reserve-meets

2) 2020 and 2021 will be flukes in mortgage company earnings. At my old lender March to early May 2020 was hard for most but by mid may things went crazy and my old boss went from casually making 40k a month to about 70k a month (top branch producer made 180k in 1 month). The branch made so much money that I got a 300 buck Amex card, a branded tumbler, and everyone at the company got apple watches. The combination of a massive seller's market and low rates have made a massive profit for the industry, but this is not sustainable. Rates will rise and new home purchases and refis will slow down (especially refis).

3) These flukes will lead to layoffs as staff that was hired for this sellers market will be trimmed, obviously negatively effecting the price. 

4) RKT is largely tech company it's big draw was e closings. Much like Robin Hood with 0 fee trading big lenders can jump in and create that tech. Rkt has to establish itself like Robinhood did. 

I'm not saying don't invest, but understand that this could be rkts ceiling. What's the bull case on this stock?

Didn't learn my lesson and got burned today. Sat out yesterday's massacre and figured today would be a good time to get in for another upward spike. Bought 200 shares @ 137. Now I am hoping like hell that premarket can pull off a miracle for me again and get some decent upward movement. Regardless, I'm selling within the first 30 minutes of open. I'll end up having made a profit of around $5k total if I can get out with the price per share being at $80, but losing about $10k because I was an dipshit today kind of stings.

The car in the example would be that the $10k margin loan I take I would investing it into SPY/VOO, so it would hopefully/potentially earn me more than it is just sitting in savings by earning the 5-10% yearly returns of the S&P

Besides that Robinhood although praised for its accessibility by reg retail investors it has recently lost alot of credibility when it comes to their financial soundness. Also Chamath pointed out something really interesting in his All-in Pod which was that these issues were totally avoidable had they performed there stress tests periodically, and these problems would have never been in the same magnitude as we saw recently.

1695,RH," I closed out and moved to fidelity. I think they're cooked. 2 weeks ago I was excited about the idea of their IPO. Right now, no thank you. Look at it this way:

- Their liquidity was being risked by volatility and they took the action of forcing investor restrictions to curb volatility to their financial benefit and clear investor detriment. Not a lawyer, but... I smell risk.

- Mutterings from congress on both sides of the aisle to investigate. BOTH SIDES. Nobody can accomplish that, are you KIDDING me?!

- News reports that RH drew billions on bank credit to stay solvent

- If there is no legal exposure, you cannot ignore their financial flailing. I cannot believe they are healthy watching this.

- If there is no legal exposure and they are presently healthier than I understand, just imagine what the perception means for their customer base and future prospects. The app has been 1 starred, deleted reviews, and re-1 starred. People are vocally leaving. The reputation is in tatters, fairly or not, doesn't matter.
