11,IMO," His comments on it made it very clear that he didn't understand it very well. He is still pushing the ""it's only used by criminals"" nonsense when we're having platforms rollout that allow lending/borrowing with much better rates than the bond market and no middle man. I still think there are problems like transaction fees and speed that need to be fixed - and I would've respected his response if that was what he was saying. IMO though, in the history of technology (especially software) these kind of scalability issues get resolved.

I don't have any problem with someone not knowing something. But to be that vocal about it when it was clear he didn't give it more research than 10 minutes is just ignorant.

13,BYD," Buffett has been clear for nearly 70 years (literally, if you read the first letters) that his conservative investment philosophy will underperform while markets are in raging bull mode (albeit that only materialized recently, he's been historically overperforming regardless). It just doesn't play into his hand when every semi-random stock is worth billions and SPACs are taking public companies at any price. While people complain that he can't buy tech (which isn't entirely accurate considering BYD and AAPL), I welcome the fact that Berkshire managed to pretty much keep up on an earnings basis without heavy exposure to FAAAM stock is impressive and convenient; I can buy the tech titans on my own just fine so it is perfect for me to have a conglomerate (although he despises the word) of businesses that aren't correlated with tech to the same extent as the SP500, QQQ or the rest of my portfolio. It also works right into his hand to have Wall Street undervalue his business and so it does for any shareholder of any company (barring those requiring heavy cap raises). Some misconceptions are funny like all the talking heads thinking his influence on stocks he purchases as the asset of BRK while it is a detriment and they've been quite vocal about it. But I'd encourage you to just pick up the letters and read what he's had to say, what you'll find is an investor that's been nothing but a stand up and honest steward of other people's money, I don't think you'll find *any* other fund manager with such a long-going track record of honesty and good-to-decent gains. By buying BRK you get an assortment money-making business that is conservatively managed, gets to reallocate capital efficiently (it is probably, if not assuredly, the leanest company of this size) and even eat up itself (indexes do not get to buyback themselves when improperly valued), with a set of investors built over decades who do not give a fuck about the short term (which goes a long way with how management can manage). It is managed as if every shareholder is 100% BRK, they're optimized for downside protection rather than upside at all cost (which would be namely disregard for valuation and usage of leverage). I've personally reallocated a lot of my speculative gains into BRK, I see it as my go-to stock for protecting my capital while still letting it work for me (I'm too young for bonds and want to be 100% equities besides my day-to-day money). As for the letters that I'd recommend regardless of investing in BRK or not, it'll also teach you to care more about earnings than how inflated you can get the price up to in hopes of reselling it higher ASAP, or so it did for me anyway.",skeptophilic,36,/r/investing/comments/n34369/berkshire_earnings_jump_buffett_continues_to_buy/gwog7fq/,0.03,0.835,0.134,0.9938

33,ANY," There was a statistic on transactions for Bitcoins when they blew up major black markets on TOR. Based on these transactions you could make assumptions based on the amount of people visiting, the given transactions and you can get all daily transactions in a heartbeat.

I am not fear mongering, it's obvious that something like this will have a (small) percentage that will misuse it, just like every great innovation (take the motor in your car for example, which is also used in war machines). And my point is not to say that this is a large group, the last statistics I read estimated 10-12%. My point was rather that the group that is in on Bitcoin thinking it's the new stable currency has shrunken a ton. And you dont need to be a genius to see that, you only need to have invested into Crypto to see the gains and losses every single day.

Inflation for money is real, but it's no problem. The way its counteracted is that EVERYTHING works based on money, meaning if it has less value of 100 years, then all products will equally lose value. If everyone earns more money, everything will cost more. That's how the market (global economy) balances itself. 

But with Bitcoin the main issue that kept me from going on was that I never knew how much money I had. It literally jumped up and down by 30% on some days. If I bought something today, then tomorrow might mean I paid 30% more, or made a great deal. But I couldnt know what will happen. At thats the point. Bitcoin is amazing to park money (well, if you are willing to take the risk) and let it sit for a long time. But sometimes this meant you went from 14k per coin down to 7k, effectively losing 50%. If you need the money in that moment, then you are f\*cked. And that went on for some years until it started picking back up again. You won't have that issue with any currency. Sure, if you want to go from let's say Africa to Europe, your currency f\*cks you hard. But most people won't do that and have more than enough in their own country. For bitcoin, it affects ANY purchase you want to make in another currency or even in bitcoin itself.",oodex,1,/r/investing/comments/n34369/berkshire_earnings_jump_buffett_continues_to_buy/gwnzfwc/,0.046,0.857,0.097,0.9511

35,IMO," I'm not a Bitcoiner (tho I've been interested in understanding it lately) so please don't lump me with the cryptobros like delusional OP above saying BRK is unproductive but BTC is, but no there will be no more Bitcoins produced passed 21M (or right about) because the number produced is halved every 4 years (asymptotic function), so it'll cap out in some decades. Transaction are sent to the network with a fee and miners process the higher paying ones first kind of like bids (fees going to the miner who added the block). So when the network wasn't congested fee-less transactions were processed, but as transactions ramp up so do fees. Which, IMO now, is a huge thorn on its utility when the network ""can"" only process 1 mb of hash-filled transaction every ~10 minutes, which is a self-imposed limit by the community and probably what made the discourse go from ""digital money"" (which was unequivocally [the original goal](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/2/)) to ""digital gold"", because 1 mb per 10 minutes will never be enough to support day-to-day transactions. I say that because it works into the hands of the miners; a small block size assures transaction scarcity and high fees. 

Edit: You also asked the point comparing to Visa in another comment, which is to have a trust-less, decentralized and inflation-proofed form of money, and it really is the first incarnation of such a currency. The only way someone can counterfeit (more exactly double-spend) Bitcoin is to have more than half the total processing power of the network, by which point you'd probably be better off just using that power to generate Bitcoins than destroy it's value by killing the trust.",skeptophilic,1,/r/investing/comments/n34369/berkshire_earnings_jump_buffett_continues_to_buy/gwojbmu/,0.066,0.822,0.112,0.8688

55,AMD," Only two years of data, but CAGR of roughly 28%. Big time winners like Tesla and Roku. I maintain a base position, wait for for sector rotations, then use excess capital pounce on good deals.

My cash position fluctuates because I use charts during downtrends to predict support levels. Crowdstrike for instance, I doubled my position when it dipped to the $170s. Once it ran to about $220 again I sold all of the shares I bought back in—maintaining my core position but using liquidity to lower cost basis and make quick profit. 

I also avoid initiating a first time position and buy higher than my cost basis. AMD put out an amazing quarter and went down...  I had to grit my teeth and leave it there because I initiated in the 60s.

It’s definitely not for everyone—however when you’ve done the homework on a company you’ll realize it’s never the end of the world like they tell you on CNBC.

Drops in the market happen FAST. Not uncommonly, in a day or two, then take years to come back.

In the last few big drops - the government has stepped in strongly to free up money, so the markets surged back quickly. 

Since I think long term, when the drops happened, I sold nothing and plowed all the extra cash I had into equities. 

As the markets rebounded, I was making huge gains. The real estate crisis was great - for me. I was in the red end of year, but less than 6 months later I was 10% overall, and it only got better.

If I recall, I have had only 4 or so years that were net negative - because I have always been buying.

The trick will be on the other end, when I intend to start taking out. But if I can keep it up - I’ll not need to ever take out to pay bills...I’ll just live off the dividends.

I think the issue I have with this is that a lot of these areas may be ""upcoming"" themes, but they've been being bought as if they're tomorrows themes, especially things like shroom stocks or battery companies that aren't going to have a product until 2025.  What's left as ""undervalued"" in terms of disruptive themes?  QS had a lot of hype and ramped to $132 before reality set in and it lost half quickly...then lost some more and then was called a fraud. Maybe they do have some great product years from now (I don't own it, don't have any interest) - who knows - but if you were a buyer into hype over $100, how long are you a bagholder waiting for it to get back there. Basically, even if something is ""disruptive"", where you buy it still matters. Weed stocks have rebounded a lot in the last year, but if you bought a couple of years ago and held, you were looking at considerable losses for a time there as the hype cooled and those names cratered. There was also problems with oversupply in Canada (and those problems still seem to exist to some degree - https://mjbizdaily.com/analyst-warns-of-more-closures-consolidation-amid-canadian-cannabis-glut)

IMO, with discussions of inflation, people should consider not looking as much this year at the ""rapidly growing and might be profitable someday"" and should be looking more at the ""high quality, highly profitable and can raise prices.""

""online gambling""

Evolution Gaming has done exceedingly well over the last year, but that's to the point where I took a bit of profit I'm not buying more here. I think it's going to be a fairly big theme (and states are going to welcome the revenue) but a very competitive industry.

I own a small position in Weedmaps from when the SPAC deal was announced and own small positions in a few MSOs.

The MSOs are more appealing to me than the pure play growers but still are probably never going to be a huge position. As with online gambling, I think cannabis gains traction in an increasing amount of states given that they're going to be looking for the revenue but it still goes back to supply and demand and if you're a grower and you're producing product like the population is going to get stoned 24/7/365 and that's not the case, you wind up with a mountain of unsold product.

73,SE," Any thing Jack Ma touched has been greatly downgraded. He is not really in charge.  As for Tencent it is subject to stiff government fine.  People like its wechat pay better than government banks as it pays more interest.  I think Pingdodo is a terrible internet commerce site selling contraband stuff. IMO it is overvalued. State dept has a long list of stocks it would like to be removed from US stock exchange. Audit of these US stocks in China can produce more potential issues.

75,IMO," If it isn't clear to anyone, China is in the middle of trying to engineer a soft landing for their asset bubbles...and they are deliberately making moves to discourage investment so that prices move sideways. This is what CCP will likely do for the foreseeable future: slowly pricks markets whenever they look a bit frothy. 

This is as opposed to what's happening in the West, with asset bubbles continuing to grow larger and the Fed continuing with easing policy. 

IMO China is a great investment now, but due to political risk I'd pair it with defense stocks and pick a reasonable limit as a total of your portfolio. In my case I have a dollar of ""China hedge"" stocks for every $5 in Chinese.",cr0ne,10,/r/investing/comments/n2yo1s/should_i_have_sold_my_chinese_stocks/gwmkn05/,0.061,0.865,0.074,0.1798

80,BABA," Munger bought BABA recently.  The big tech stocks in China are worth a buy imo but I would only allocate a small sum.  I own Baba and Tencent.  The drama with the Chinese government and big tech stocks is exaggerated.  If anything, China charging Baba 4% of their 2019 revenues means that their financials haven't been falsified.  However I am worried about the threat of delisting and trade wars.  With stocks so $, I've been looking elsewhere outside of the US for value and I think China is starting to look more appealing.

92,TSM," I would agree with you. Conditions really have deterioted.  Last few weeks 150 fighters, bombers, AVAC have flown over. In late April, a spy plane flew 30 meters above sea level looking for a dead radar spot and its Twn radar stations covering it.

Biden, while stating he wanted no military conflict has quietly sent delegates to neighboring nations seeking alliance recently. Furthermore, Great Britian and France are sending aircraft carriers not only to South China Sea but through Taiwan Strait to Jpn and S Korea showing they care. Chinese militia fishermen are recruited to practice wolf pack tactics harassing war ships. The modern weapons are not effective against peoples war. There are two PRC aircraft carrier groups encircling Twn. Somehow a US frigate came out of nowhere cutting into Chinese fleet following a PRC carrier hinting US has a stealth technology.  As for escalation, India media is calling for government to support Twn keep the area safe. To launch an attack takes a couple of weeks since most are already put in place for decades. If we lose Twn the fence is broken for rest east Pacific.

Lest discuss stocks. Twn can retaliate firing 3 missiles to Chinese stock exchange buildings. That will basically evaporate most Chinese equity ($19T) with a closure of stock exchanges. No need to aim anywhere. It is so costly to Xia will recall their troops back.

94,UK," It is a geopolitical matter (and not an ""internal matter"" as the CCP likes to claim) because nowadays cultural genocide and forced assimilation of other cultures and ethnicities tends to lead to international opposition and hence to sanctions. Criticism of such behavior is often used as an instrument of soft power and as justification for economic sanctions or worse.

Sensibilities have changed when compared to centuries and even decades ago. Your whattaboutism is irrelevant since *I was not discussing who is morally better between Chinese and US or UK companies*. What you attack is a strawman, becauase my point was that you can't claim that *every* **country** is like that (as the person whose comment I replied to stated). For example you'd be hard pressed to argue that Switzerland is comparable to China or to the US or UK in that regard, say on the historical scale of the past 200 years.

It is absurd to claim that investment in a country that is headed for a cold war with what is an emerging alliance of the entire West with some of its most powerful neighbors (India, Japan etc.) can ignore the likely economic impact of such emerging conflict.
