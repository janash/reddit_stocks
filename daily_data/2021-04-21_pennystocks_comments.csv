2,ALL," This is why I only invest in stocks that have a definitive plan.  This way I know if I should stay invested or not.  

Here are 2 examples from me that I treated different... 

1.  I was HEAVY in Medivolve (COPRF) as I really loved and saw a great opportunity setting up all the cubes they were planning for testing.  Once I realized they shifted plans and were no longer planning to continue to expand the cubes idea as the originally planned I cut bait with a small profit.  Thankful, because they really tanked soon after.
2. I am invested in St. Georges (SXOOF).  I loved the plan developing their tech for  lithium extraction and battery recycling.  ALL the results of their testing for both  those ideas have not only been met but the results have been AMAZING.  Despite that I am down    ?20-30%.  I am holding as I know they met their catalyst and continue on their plans to meet future catalyst, i.e. opening battery recycling plants and closing on partnerships/ government contracts or funding.

So 2 stocks and the stock price of either does not matter to me.  I am investing in small companies that are doing things I like.  As an shareholder I am watching carefully.  Any sign they are not doing what they say OR failing at what the plan is I would cut bait.  There are SEVERAL good penny stocks, but folks who try to trade them based on thinking they can predict future SP are wrong as NO ONE can predict SP (even with SP500 companies). If you don't know why you are invested in a company then you have NO CLUE if you should stay invested or not.

17,DD," Will you though?  How do you “know” you’ll recoup if you keep holding?  
I keep holding and holding because I didn’t sell when I should’ve because I’m ignorant. I’m now down by around 50%.  
I hear you, reluctant to sell at a loss so you can buy dips, average down etc. I’ve done this with bad results, 7-layer dip etc.  I guess I’m saying I am stuck, so far down may as well hold, cross my fingers and hope one of them saves me in a month or five.  YOU on the other hand, only 28% down, you could cash out and reevaluate.     

Here’s my wall of shame, all down, bought when they were the talk of the town. I guess I’m just always late to the party. Except for $AABB, which I got in at .01ish, then squandered it all, selling other stocks to buy more AABB at fucking .65...  If I had just overslept that day...

Edit: it hurts given the amount of vaccines out there in the US.

75,RSI," If you are chasing a stock that is running multiple days in a row, set a trailing stop loss maybe 10-15% rather than being left holding the bag, perhaps you can wait a few more days and average down, BBKCF is currently getting hammered in the Frankfurt exchange.

Got in early sub $1.5, so made sense to sell, noticed a lot of popular traders (Timothy Sykes), various youtubers and articles published all hyping up bbkcf, as the saying goes ‘buy the hype, sell the news’ so it was apparent it was going to sell off after Coinbase DPO or March earnings. 

If you use indicators like Bollinger bands, it smashed passed the upper band (which is 2 standard deviations above the average) showing the stock is very overbought. The wider the area of the band the more volatile the stock is which was the case when BBKCF ran. So when the area tightens (using daily candles), the stock price is ‘consolidating’ which is where It is stable and I might find an entry.

RSI was also over 90 for a while, so doesn’t make sense to enter unless for a quick scalping opportunity.

116,PUMP," .004

&#x200B;

There are other .004 stocks out there that don’t even have a website and certainly do not have a press release on yahoo!  Yet - people are buying them up to PUMP AND DUMP them.

117,CBD," Not sure what you man when you say yahoo finance doesn’t recognize it. It is everywhere, yahoo finance also released their partnership with Bobby On the SHRU.

In no WAY do I believe this is a pump and dump or a scam. Again, what the hell is .0039, whoops, now .042 for those haters. That is in your ashtray. I’m in for 500,000 with an avg.  of .004 After a second purchase at .0038 this morning. When it hits .10 and I believe it will this year, that is a net profit of $48,000 and a x25 bagger and I will sell.

Of course psilocybin mushrooms are illegal!  We are just now going through cannabis reform!  They are decriminalized in certain places including Michigan where they opened their first retail location for their CBD.
