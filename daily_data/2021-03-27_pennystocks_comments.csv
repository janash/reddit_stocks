20,AEZS," I buy a penny stock called AEZS and it usually pumps once a week on Thursday or Friday, anywhere between 9:00am CST and 11:00am CST, then usually drops shortly after. It’s not a huge spike, but with the price sitting at $1.20ish it’s a fairly easy cash grab. You can go look at it’s recent historical trends starting in late January and see it’s got a fairly decent pattern. Almost always goes down on Friday though, so just don’t get caught holding the bag. It usually jumps anywhere from 5-30 cents. Not huge, but money is money. Yesterday specifically it jumped by 30 cents and helped me to cut some of my losses from a big spike I bought in on with it a month or so ago. I think the stock could actually take off, and some analyst somewhere in the world gave it a $7.50 EOY, but we’ll see if that comes to fruition.

43,TFSA," It's all relative depending on your own tax laws.

I'm in Canada, from what I gather based on this year's capital gains 50% of that would be taxed on top of my regular income .... Which means if I had room in an RRSP for contribution I could drop in that amount and protect those capital gains for now and reinvest them as well for investing in my retirement.

Currently 75% of my overall investments, only started this year in February, is in TFSA so gains are tax free ... But do have an regular personal account as well for some OTC investing as they can't be held in TFSA, and possibly looking at some crypto so gains there would also be taxable (ETFs for crypto however could be held in TFSA or RRSP, and there are now a few for Bitcoin anyhow).

Capital losses can be applied to the past 3 years gains I do believe or brought forward to apply against gains forever ... At least if memory serves correctly from the so much research and reading I have done this past two months.

I currently have no RRSP so lots of room for protection, would be a very happy man if I could pull enough capital gains from investing to fill it up in the next few years :).

So my current take anyhow from my situation, but it's for Canada and would only apply to other Canadians ... Barely know my own tax laws around this stuff ...

61,TBLT, Anyone else holding TBLT and curious about the drop?  Good revenue growth YOY but I’m guessing the expenses are concerning to some investors?  I’ve also heard the drop today could be shorts getting out since the news was overall “good”.  Would like to hear some genuine perspective.

63,ID," Opened an etrade account same day as I opened one with fidelity, funds took about the same to settle. In the process of getting to know the websites I got a warning that my account features had been disabled until I call etrade to confirm ID. I called, took about three hours to get through. They were nice, I uploaded documents, account was enabled after they called me back. Same day, right after, I go to open the app and miss the finger sensor. Account disabled again. Finally called them a month later (three hour hold made me lazy to call again) to transfer my funds back to my bank, let them know I was leaving without having done a single trade. Told them security is too ridiculous, tried to get me on some vip app. Idk man, just venting.
