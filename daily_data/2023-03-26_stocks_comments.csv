5,ALL," It will end the same as it ALWAYS ends.  Folks will underperforms the market AND will have a bigger drag due to the cash balance that is causing a ""cash drag"". Sort of like trying to win a race wearing muddy boots.

This is the issue most folks don't realize when it comes to investing in the stock market.  Most of returns of the stock market comes down to just a handful of days which has NOTHING to do if they are in the cycles of ""bear"" or ""bull"" markets.  Those are just arbitrary cycles we invented.  ALL the money gained in the market are during those most volatile days in the market.  If one is NOT invested in those volatile days your returns will end up being less then if you just held cash during the ENTIRE period of time, i.e. never invested at all.  The hard part of investing is realizing those HIGHEST returning days are unknown but what is known they are usually clustered around the WORST days as well.  So they are the exact periods of time everyone is advising, ""Oh this looks like a bad time to be invested you should wait this one out"".  That is the EXACT time you should be fully invested.  NO ONE knows when the highest returning days will be that will give the entire return of the stock market, but they are usually clustered around the WORST performing days.  So advice:  Stay fully invested ALL the time.

I did a thread about this with all the data and calculations about 12-18 months ago if you want to search for it showing how those few days in the last 30 years or so account for ALL th returns of the market.",10xwannabe,6,/r/stocks/comments/122insl/if_market_timing_generally_doesnt_work_out_for/jdqoycb/,0.081,0.876,0.043,-0.951
6,GOEV," I literally decided a few years back to sink my feet in and brace.

I chickened out one morning when I invested 27k in GOEV and while walking my dog that morning with my younger brother I had an unrealized loss of 4k. He panicked and told me to sell and sketched me the fuck out.

I sold. On his advice. Had I held 2 or 3 months. I would've sat at a 130k gain.

I realized then my brother didn't have the temperance for investing and I started actively studying and embodying philosophy to gain control of your emotions and mind.

Same situation. But with $XPEV back in 2020. I made a 40k net profit after holding to my initial reasonings for 2 months or so. I stayed resilient despite outward forces out of my control. I saw value and reminded myself that what I saw then, hadn't changed. Only the price action some market maker dictated was just.

I started studying more and more. Came to the conclusion the markets were rigged and heard down the grape vine those who control the markets employee psychologists to leverage trades in their favor by playing this game of tug of war with fear to fleece the crowds.

Few months after that I had another 20k net profit. Few months after that I was down maybe 40k on a certain meme stock and despite the negative media press I started to ask, why are they vehemently posting hatred?

I used the wise Sage advice of a humble slave named Epictetus and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to break it down plainly.

*Some large entity was going to lose a lot of money in the coming months and needed to shake out retail.
*They enacted a corporate media buyout to push a narrative to meet their truth.

And then... lo and behold, my first 6 figure net profit. 308k. Bam. Realized in 4 months of patient waiting.

The coming months I wouldn't see anything that wild till March 2022, a cool 30k. Then I was busy with businesses so I couldn't really keep up with what was happening in the market.

Something fucky happened in June/July. Big media outlets started pushing the bankruptcy narrative and cost cutting initiatives by cutting off A/C during the summer.

Thank whatever gods may be for pattern recognition cause this was the easiest lick I've ever seen. I saw about 50-100 articles pumped in 2-3 weeks.

Sold my bike. Bought long dated options. Flipped 5k into 180k, did not take all profit due to hubris. Took all of 6 weeks to realize that gain. Still made a hefty sum.

Prior to these experiences in the broader market I've been waiting tables for years. Years of dealing with rude and unsurely people has calloused my mind to the degree that I realized one simple truth.

Rich people can buy out the media and are capable of lying.

That's where I make my money. And here we are again, I'm trying to get reacquainted with my why, where I started this journey. I want to be fortunate enough never to forget hunger and become disconnected with the suffrement that echoes through the human experience. He who has not been a good servant, will never be a good master. Time to buckle some knees.

That's just arbitrary cherry picking you invented. It's like if the class president won by one vote, everyone who voted for him goes ""the entire election came down to *me*!"", as if all those other voters weren't needed to cancel out the opposition votes.

You're just conveniently ignoring all those many tiny green days that did the heavy lifting of canceling out all the red days and claiming that a few big green days did all the gaining.

17,ALL," Absolutely.  So just be out those red days. Ahh.  There is the rub.  You can't.  The data is already out on market timing.  It doesn't work.  If you want the articles I am more then happy to oblige... You can start with the the seminal articles published:   
 Beebower/ hood/ brinson and Beebower/ singer/ Brinson published in JFA circe early 1990's put the nail in the coffin (along with all active management).  

BTW, no I am not discounting all those other green days.  You need to find my other thread.  I just subtracted out those few top days out of the 30 year period.  I included ALL the other green days.  If you did that your returns were worse then just being in cash the entire period.  

Yes you are right if you avoided the worst red days  you would have done better with just the small green days and not the big green days but that is the point you can't as no one can market time as I mentioned above.  Of course, you are one of those who think you can so go for it and let me know how it turns out in 30 years.  Charlie Ellis who ran Harvard Endowment Fund (the largest endowment in the WORLD) said market timing (along with picking stocks) was playing the Losers game so if you think you are better then him go for it.

18,ALL," >I just subtracted out those few top days out of the 30 year period. I included ALL the other green days.

That's what the cherry picking is. You purposely subtracted out a handful of days specifically *because* they're mega-green. Then you're declaring that *they* are the ones solely responsible for gains. That's as sound logic as 

>Absolutely.  So just be out those red days.

If you can dodge all those green days, I can dodge the red days. Why can you cherry pick but not I?


I'm familiar with the literature. I'm also familiar with the literature that says the big green are adjacent to the big red, so it's impossible to miss one and not the other. That's why this ""you can't afford to miss these few days"" adage is bunk.

I am trying to say is no one knows when any of those great days are going to happen so you have to be invested every day to get those great days.  That means you have to accept those small greens, small reds, great greens, and terrible reds.  You have to accept all of them part and parcel.

You can't avoid those really bad days just like you can't just be invested for those really good days as that is market timing to try find or avoid any specific type of ""day"" and no one can do either.

- For VZ (Verizon): I bought at $50.09 (average cost basis for 100+ shares). The stock price is $37.66, so this one is worse. It’s down -24.82%

- I sell covered calls on both of these while collecting dividends so it’s not too bad. I have a little more than 100 shares of each due to dividends getting reinvested at first. But I’ve turned off the DRIP for now, as I’d rather keep the cash and deploy elsewhere.

* An investor is risk averse.
* An investor prefers to increase consumption.
* The investor's utility function is concave and increasing, due to their risk aversion and consumption preference.
* Analysis is based on single period model of investment.
* An investor either maximizes their portfolio return for a given level of risk or minimizes their risk for a given return.

194,USA," One of the biggest supply constraints has been semiconductors.

There's a reason besides outsourced labor on why they're not here in the USA.

Those factories require very tight tolerances for everything, including seismic activity. These factories are location in places around the world that have very very low seismic activity to increase their yield. They haven't been able to find a location in the US that has low enough activity for them to expect the yield they are willing to accept.

Not that it matters now anyways. The neon required for the lasers in the process can't be obtained because most of it comes from Ukraine.",Desenski,2,/r/stocks/comments/1221iix/why_focus_on_suppressing_demand_and_not/jdpcdo1/,0.058,0.884,0.058,0.0159

198,JPM," This is exactly it.

QE is buying bonds directly and probably pushes up asset prices more.  While maybe not AS powerful, it's still an extraordinary amount of stimulus to the tune so far of at least ~$400B.  As you mentioned JPM estimates a maximum of $2T.

It is 100% a bailout *at the taxpayer's expense*.  Not just indirectly because saving bank creditors and investors is inflationary, but directly as a fiscal expense.  

The reason being is that the Fed is paying extraordinary overnight interest expense on a scale like never before in history.  By printing money out of thin air and pushing tons of payments out to banks, the Fed is massively subsidizing them.

Based on your ideological leanings you can argue this is good and desirable, but I don't see how anyone can logically follow what is happening here and not 100% conclude this is a bailout paid for by otherwise prudent and responsible savers that had no hand in this mess.

Want to kill inflation and destroy too much money in the system?  Let creditors and investors fail, but protect depositors.  That's how capitalism is supposed to work, those who take risks take the fall not socializing the damage.",absoluteunitVolcker,5,/r/stocks/comments/12219lu/question_about_the_fed_balance_sheet/jdqpw4e/,0.135,0.733,0.131,-0.2439
199,ZM," This is kind of only an argument in theory though. It’s kind of like if you had a $10k portfolio and you spent $4 on Zoom stock(or 0.04% which is what their current holding is) and then it blew up. Sure, they buy more as it rises but it couldn’t have ever been a significant part of the returns that year just based on position sizing relative to their bigger positions. 

It looks like when they IPO’d in 2019 ZM was worth about $30 billion, a bit higher than today, but my guess is that VTI’s holding wasn’t significantly bigger than it is now at a $20 billion cap/0.04%. 

It’s hard to find historical data on holdings of VTI, but at their peak ZM got up about to $150 billion or the size of where Verizon is right now on the holdings list(0.3%). However, this was also very brief(less than a month) so perhaps VTI didn’t buy as if it was that high. Maybe they got up to 0.2% or something. 

During this stretch from Jan. 2020-Dec. 2021, ZM had price appreciation of 162% for the year. But at ~0.2% of the fund…Let’s go back to my $10k example for easier math. 0.2% of $10k is $20. 162% gain on $20 brings it up to ~$50.  VTI went up 45% during this stretch, so your $10k went up to $14,400, but only about $50 of 
that was from Zoom. Does that make sense? 

VOO went up 44.5% from 2020-21, slightly less than VTI. But the difference on a $10k investment in total was around $100. VOO would also fall a few percent less the next few years.",Uknow_nothing,4,/r/stocks/comments/1229kws/voo_or_vti_for_long_term/jdr9o3s/,0.012,0.907,0.081,0.9639

Their outstanding shares have exploded in the past few years due to poor acquisitions, and are lighting billions on fire to try and scale Disney Plus, pumping out tons of content that really doesn't belong on their platform.

I think management should have kept Disney Plus as an exclusive Disney IP service, rather than try and compete in a highly-competitive broad streaming industry with a million other services. Not to mention their declining cable business, which has historically been an absolute money printer.

As other people have stated, Disney hasn't been too innovative recently- seemingly running out of new ideas.
