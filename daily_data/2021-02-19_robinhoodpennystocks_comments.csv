This reminds me of a story I read about these folks who made a killing in betting against malls. Their belief was that all of these malls were just decaying relics due to declines in foot traffic and retail space occupancy. They also believed the malls weren't necessarily being truthful when they provided their occupancy numbers. They went to this one mall and saw that all of these stores had closed, but the mall owner was renting out these empty stores as ""community spaces"" that had a few tables and chairs in them, just so they could say that the spaces weren't vacant. This just further supported their belief that the malls were living on borrowed time, and COVID proved to be the death blow that made these investors a fortune.",TheGallopingGhost77,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ln2i9v/daily_discussion_thread/go0xhq2/,0.1,0.882,0.019,-0.8943

Another company striving to regain compliance so it will remain on NASDAQ, which it has until March 15 to do so. A specialty health sciences company from my hometown of San Diego, GHSI develops clinically supported nutrition, medical foods and medical devices with a focus in the ocular health marketplace. It sounds wild, but they make food to help your eyes, which as a glasses  wearer AND glutton, I'm all for. In December they brought on a new CEO Bret Scholtes, an industry veteran who previously guided Omega Protein Corporation, pumping revenue, acquisitions, and (more importantly) stock price until it was successfully sold to a strategic buyer in 2017. Late January GHSI's Malaysian distributor announced it had received approval by the Malaysian National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency to slang their immuno-pills, which had Bret stoked as “a key part of our strategy includes expansion into foreign markets”. They MAY have an offering of up to $25 million soon according to SEC documents, which to me, in conjunction with their debt vs assets suggest planned acquisition. I like what they do, the new CEO seems capable, and they're from my hometown. I like it.

403,EV," Good write but that’s your specialty so that’s all I’ll give you is a good. But this is mostly pharma. Investing in GME you know that pharma isn’t the only play and you started to deviate at the end towards minerals but with pennies. You hope for a buy from a larger company and pharma the opportunity is there but minerals have been caught in pump and dumps for months cause of the EV battery nonsense. Overall your research is sound but be careful just posting positives or reading positives because once you are in the company you will try to make everything positive i.e. laying off employees as you stated. As cost cutting as that can be that’s usually a save move not a progressive move from a company. 
And next time make different posts for companies to draw interest and feedback cause most won’t put the time in to read each company.

Edit: Just to add clarification, this comment has nothing to do with encouraging a hold nor a sell. Often people sell off at peaks expecting a dip - this usually occurs if the peak is near the lower end of the expected price target. Since CTXR is deemed highly undervalued, this dip will likely not occur before this weekend and if you attempt to buy back in it may not be at the dipped prices you expect.",xxquikmemez420,9,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lnhwyp/hold_ctxr_through_weekend/go0iqtr/,0.023,0.892,0.085,0.7269

604,AGTC," ""covered"" means that you own the shares and that if the call you sell gets exercised, you don't have to buy the shares to fulfill your obligation because you already own them.  The opposing move would be selling a ""naked"" call.  Which means you don't own the shares, and if it gets exercised, you have to buy the shares at market price to fulfill your part of the contract.  Naked contracts like this are a very easy way to  lose unfathomable amounts of money if you don't absolutely 100% know what you are doing.  By selling a covered call, the only risk is having to sell the 100 shares at below market value, but your theoretical loss has a maximum.

&#x200B;

For example (and I didn't even think about this and m going to do it tomorrow), I own 100 shares of AGTC at 5.03.  If I sell a call for those 100 shares with a 12.50 strike price expiring 3/19, I get a $63 premium, and my risk is that I have to sell my 100 shares for an over 100% gain instead of being able to hold them longer.",platypusbelly,11,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ln156w/how_do_i_invest_another_200/gnyez9s/,0.054,0.794,0.152,0.9403

618,CEO," They just closed on a recent public offering which raised about $28.75 million for Onconova therapeutics with a huge increase in volume. The initial offering was at $1 and at the time of me typing it was at $1.62. Just in the past month, the stock has risen by 101% and is excepted to rise some more. I don’t see why it can’t get to $3 by the end of the month. Note that I’m not by any means a financial expert, this is just what I found with some general research.

Edit: here is the official announcement from Onconova 

https://investor.onconova.com/news-releases/news-release-details/onconova-therapeutics-inc-announces-closing-2875-million-public

Edit 2: also the CEO and board should be making an announcement in the next few days so that should do some good things

679,AGTC," I’m just starting off on call options, but this is for sure just a learning experience. I bought a 7/16(?) $5 call for AGTC last week. 

My reasoning was: it gives me plenty of time before it expires for it to appreciate in value, and a $5 was pretty close to being ITM already when I bought it.

Both of these contributed to me paying a relatively high premium compared to if I had bought a 2/19 call. However, I would much rather pay more in premiums for a position that I really do believe in LT than buying a shorter position for less of a premium.

Edit: if the dipping continues, I plan to put about 5x my initial investment ($215) in shares and calls next week whenever Schwab gives me access to my account

687,AGTC," Just to give you my thought process for this in case my logic is wrong: One of the first things I read about options was how they decrease in value the closer they are to expiration, all things remaining consistent.

If you’re very confident of when a stock will boom, you can capitalize on shorter options. But if you just generally think the stock will go up and you’re not too sure by how much or even when exactly, then long term calls are the way to go. You’re technically risking more by paying a higher premium, but if you are good with that, I’d look for ones that are very close to being in the money.

To give you context for my AGTC option. The premium was 2.15 for a $5 call so my break even (if I let it expire) is $7.15 a share. I thought this was 100% doable when I bought seeing as I had until July for this to happen (AGTC was around $5 a share when I bought it the option).

Another thing I realized, this one about myself, is that I am a very emotional trader which more often than not is going to mean losses. Long options, to an extent, take the emotion out of it since I have months before I need to decide what to do. They also encourage me to do more DD about companies before buying because I know it’ll more often than not I’m not going to exit my position within a month

This is in no way advice and I’m learning just as much as anyone else here. I just want to give insight into why i buy what I do in case that helps your process at all!",unmelted_ice,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lnjze8/mental_strength/go1tnpy/,0.039,0.875,0.086,0.93

Half the DD posts in here do not include positions, but anyone who posts bullish DD here or in any other investing subreddit has a vested interest in that stock going up, and is posting in the hopes of raising the price so they can profit off their shares/calls. I briefly skimmed some of the content he posted about the reverse google image searches and believe it does have at least some substance to it.

So, while they’re helpful, remember that a PT can be for a few years.

As far as how many, I have no idea. Think of them as educated guesses. They can see the first card of the hand, but they don’t know if there’s a 2 or a 10 underneath, or if the company will bust when they take a hit.

-Relative volume over 2

-Is anyone talking about the company?

-If so, why?

 **Bombadier –** BDRBF Market Cap: $1.108B 	

Whoooooooo boy do I see a lot of folks discuss/shill this stock. I understand the appeal. **IT'S CHEAP!** I believe it's the cheapest stock on RH. The Canadian business jet manufacturer recently had an earnings call that on first glance was not so good but digging into it a little bit more...well it's still not good in the immediate but it's not THAT bad. Laying off 1600 employees? Generally seen as bad. Selling off the rail side of the business? Also generally seen as bad, but I see it as a positive. The company claims to want to swerve to being a “pure-play business jet company” so jettisoning the transportation side of the business makes sense. Doing it because of your HUGE amount of debt? Both good and bad. Having 12 aircraft returned by Indonesia because Britain is investigating your company for bribery in airplane sales? Yikes that's bad. I could see this a very speculative loooooong term play. It's cheap AF and has that “set it and forget it” appeal, for me there's more I could do with my money before waiting for an aging industry titan to right the ship.",Itsboomhomie,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lnhg5b/thoughts_on_bdrbf_currently_at_045/go101ca/,0.062,0.794,0.144,0.9734
