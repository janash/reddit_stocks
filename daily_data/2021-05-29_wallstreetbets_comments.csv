27,AMC, AMC shorts have no reason to cover. The company itself pisses money every day. They will never make a profit and have 0 plans to fix any of it. So retail you can push this stock to 100 dollars. All your going to do is have them increase their short position at higher numbers..... We traded 635m shares on Thursday with a 450m float. So hate to break it to you guys but shorts didn‚Äôt cover and it appears this was just retail unloading shares at higher prices onto other retail investors.  So unless amc actually does something like a steaming service or gets bought out by another company that actually knows what they‚Äôre doing. I don‚Äôt see any situation where shorts will cover. All these news articles you read are fooling you. ‚ÄúShorts lost 1.6 billion on amc today‚Äù. Yeah bud that‚Äôs unrealized losses. They can wait all year for that shit to go back down so they make their money back. Short of a absolute market crash of 40% across the board.

229,GME," It's the most predictable pattern imaginable, which isn't a huge surprise, given that we're dealing with a bunch of hedgefund boomer fucks and the troll farms / bots they're funding.

You can see exactly the same thing happening AGAIN, and you don't even have to go out of your way to find it.

GME was pushed out of the spotlight by an overwhelming üÖ∞Ô∏è‚ìÇÔ∏è¬©Ô∏è ""sentiment"" (not that moviestock is a bad play! üíéüëêü¶ç) to prevent GME liftoff.

Now that üÖ∞Ô∏è‚ìÇÔ∏è¬©Ô∏è has spiked upward and is at risk of lifting off, it's being flooded out by üÖ±Ô∏èüÖ±Ô∏è complete and utter bullshit spam.

To be fair, he DIDN'T say the aforementioned three were BETTER moves than GME or AMC, in fact he said anyone selling and worse considering shorting either would be crazy given how locked in on them that those on WSB are right now.  He stated, basically that those on here underestimated the collective power of the (somewhat) unified group by ONLY targetting AMC and GME.  The problem with the whole premise for that segment, was his weird assumption that that a present focus on the two meant that we do not follow the market as a whole, and have not set our sights, or indeed begun to move on other stocks.

I doubt he even really believed as much, it seemed more like he knew most people on WSB would have zero interest in listening to him, so he didn't put all that much effort into the whole ""somehow you'll be putting me in my place if you...invest in these stocks I'm about to suggest"" idea.",elliottAM,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nnb4d1/wsb_discussion_today/gzue7rz/,0.085,0.831,0.084,0.153

318,AMC," Don't worry neither do 90% of the people in on this trade. Bottom line up front, noone knows where this ends, but noone in their right mind thinks AMC or GME as companies are actually worth what they are trading for right now, it's all about the squeeze. You're late to the party, maybe not too late, but you have a lot more to lose than people who bought in at the beginning because your cost basis is way higher. 

In my personal opinion the hedge funds are going to pull some bullshit in the end and retail is going to get screwed, even if that bullshit is just declaring bankruptcy (the bad kind) and leaving the rest of the market holding the bag. In which case yay you ""won"", but you're also not getting shit because the people who were obligated to buy the shares went out of business instead, oh and the market might crash too because it might create a domino effect. If Lehman brothers fell so can Melvin and Citadel.

As far as general market intro and where this might be headed, I recommend watching the movies ""Margin Call"" and ""The Big Short"" for a fun intro that's obviously not that accurate.

You must better select the right sector at the right time and at the right price.

There is minor potential for small short squeeze for this stock (days to cover is 1.8).  The perpetual gamma squeeze based on the assumption of a short squeeze and people holding shares is the driver of this stock. Stock goes up based on option calls.

This is not the most shorted stock as the OP claims.

When AMC dilutes more in order to save itself from bankruptcy (which it still has to do) then your investment will vanish as the stock is diluted. 

This is unavoidable. There is nothing that can prevent this reality from occurring and it will occur within several months.

Remember if AMC shorters felt like they are fucked they'd buy to cover as there is plenty of volume to do that then just reopen at a higher price for more possible gains. If short interest is INCREASING it tells you what their thought process is.

The bottom line retail buyers are driving up AMC price hoping that someone will throw them a lifeline and buy it from them at that higher price but it's not going to happen.

595,TSM," It's a stupid play if you rely on EVs to drive demand. You know what are the most important factors for EV chips? Not size or computing power - it's easy to cram more slower & larger chips into a car. Not energy efficiency - it's peanuts compared to the energy needed to move 2 tons of steel around. Not heat efficiency - just put more fans in there. It's reliability and price. 

Even if the demand is there, TSM won't be able to price gouge EV manufacturers - EVs don't need fancy 7nm chips, manufacturers will just buy cheaper and widely available 16/14nm chips from the competitors. It's also cheaper to increase the production capacity for 'larger' chips and TSMC doesn't have any edge in this play.

Not to mention that TSMC is already operating at max capacity, and scaling up low margin chip production is harder and less profitable than selling $50 iphone cables.

624,GME," I lost my ass on GME calls doing that very same thing.  Watching the chart at work, puckered so tight you couldn't drive a nail up my ass with a sledgehammer.  It was an emotional amount of money gone.  I quit doing options for a minute after that.  Been much more successful lately.  Buy closer to the money, and further out, sell when you're comfortable with the profit because you can always go back in.  And if it's far enough out and you don't think it'll get there, you can still sell an OTM contract in some cases rather than let it expire worthless and cut your losses.  


My basic strategy has become buying a year or more out, close to the money, and if it hits a few dollars above the strike, or even in some instances a dollar above break-even, just selling it and moving on.

Stocks are way less risky, you can make a bad decision and still only lose 10-20%.. but you‚Äôre gains are more limited.  Option trading you have to go in willing to lose 100%. It‚Äôs much more risky. But your gains potential is much higher. 

For example, I bought most of these calls when PLTR was trading around 19.90-20.00.... i invested around $10,000. if I only bought shares my gains would have been more around $1,500... But in my situation, with owning options, if pltr simply did not change or went down to 19.50 I would have lost all $10,000",aaaa123454321,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nnurf9/successful_retard_yolo_on_pltr/gzwjioc/,0.14,0.741,0.119,-0.1787
705,IMO," I'd like to add some points to this:

You can absolutely lose all the money you pay to buy the options contracts, but they are also usually a small percentage of the price of buying the actual stock.
If you bet wrong, yes you lose 100% of it, but you can pay small amounts for options contracts (nobody is making you spend 10k like this retarded ape. You can spend $40 for a contract.)

The option will have something called a delta, or the percentage of $ change the option will see as the underlying stock moves. An option with a high delta can increase in price dramatically with the stock. The upside potential is absolutely massive. Hundreds of times the price you paid for the option can be paid out if you make a good bet.

Also, buying a stock can be riskier than an option in my opinion. I can spend a few hundred to bet on 10's of thousands of dollars worth of a stock if I'm right on my bet, and the most I lose betting on the option is the hundreds I put in.
If I put 10k on a stock, the stock's price could plummet past my stop losses and I could lose a lot more than 20-30%. Just picture a huge market crash vs a stop limit order on a stock. If everyone is heading for the door, who's gonna fill your stop limit order? If, instead, you use market stop orders all the time, you're getting scalped on the spread. Plus, that market stop can lose you massively more money than you expected.
With options, you always know exactly how much you can lose.

Considering the amount of value you can gain on the upside of buying options, versus the relatively very small amount paid for the contract, imo you end up risking a lot less on options for the payout vs what you risk buying stocks.

To answer your question though, yes you can make massively more money off options. A $4,000 call option on tesla before the rally could have made you a millionaire. You would have had to invest 100K directly into the stock for the same result.

Just... be careful. Because anytime you bet wrong, you can lose your whole investment if it expires worthlessly. Of course, you can sell the option early and get some of your money back from the time value on the contract.
So start small and don't go betting your whole account at once. IMO.",Realistic_Airport_46,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nnurf9/successful_retard_yolo_on_pltr/gzwofbj/,0.153,0.769,0.078,-0.9891

747,TX," Heyo - I'm very bullish on OTR autonomous freight and excited to see more companies available to invest in that operate in this area.

But, I want to call out two additional risks to autonomous freight compared to taxis that we should keep in mind:

\-**Legislation burden** \- Long distance trucking, with the exception of large states (CA, TX, AK), requires vehicles to cross state lines. That means, before autonomous OTR freight catches on, it will require synchronized legislation with multiple states and the fed. Taxis in one city have a lower legislation burden because likely only requires state/city approval.

\-**Depots** \- There is already a technology that allow a single individual to haul massive amounts of freight, meaning the human labor/ton of freight ratio is great. That technology is.... trains! What are the downsides of freight trains? Limited delivery points and delays in freight yards. Hence the power of trucking. However, autonomous trucking will start, as you mention, with highway traveling. That means these trucks will have to arrive at a depot, unload, and wait for a local driver. Now, I still believe that this is much more efficient use of capital, assets, and labor, but keep in mind that autonomous trucks and required depots begin to take on the look and logistical nightmare that are freight trains.

All that said, I still think that autonomous OTR is the future.

EDIT: I looked at TuSimple's investment deck, and it appears that most states have some level of approval for autonomous trucking so maybe that legislative burden is lower than I thought...",cowsbeek,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nnsnmx/tsp_the_best_way_to_play_selfdriving_today/gzw9t1y/,0.064,0.829,0.106,0.9183

761,GME," Regardless of the negative people with agendas and generic haters on here this is a huge movement. There is tons of support beyond this forum involving millions of people. Some people scalped the stock today before the 3 day weekend, so what. Honestly the same exact thing happened to GME before it exploded the following week (also a 3 day weekend). Short interest only increased. If anything this will only make the bear trap more dangerous.. The real party hasn't even started yet. You didn't see a massive sell-off AH. This thing is still live and hot. A lot of cynical people on here who act know better are going to look like fools once again (just like they did with GME). 

I could of sold for a profit today but didn't and will be loading up some more at the very beginning of next week. Bet you a lot of people who sold today are also coming back next week to push. This is just the beginning. It took a lot of dedicated people to get this far and you can bet your ass they will see this through if they haven't sold by now. Billions are at stake and those on the other side of this will try to discourage through all forms of manipulation over this long weekend. Chin up and stay the course. You are on the right side of history.
