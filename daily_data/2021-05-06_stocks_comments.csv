0,ATH," I got a large chunk of money for investments last year Jan/ Feb. I decided I didn’t want to DCA to spread it out because most times you’re better off just throwing your money in the market ASAP. 

Little did I know, Feb 2020 was the ATH before the covid crash. Most of my investments ranked 50%+. You really just need to look at the long term rather than the short term. My airline investment was down ~70% but I decided to buy more as it came down to lower my cost. Every paycheque I started putting more and more money to work and eventually everything recovered. 

Your friends are lucky to have missed the crash in 2020 and entered near the bottom to make easy money. Just take this as a lesson to not sell in the future, I’m sure you’ll recover with time. Time horizon matters a lot with investing. It wouldn’t be wise to throw all your money in growth stocks now if you retire tomorrow for example.",WonderfulIngenuity95,36,/r/stocks/comments/n65x7r/i_started_investing_in_february_2021_how_do_i/gx56sx5/,0.059,0.799,0.142,0.9391
1,DD," “How do I ride this out”

You...ummm... how do I say this... ride it out?

Seriously you gota stop looking and worrying if you can’t do that then pull your profits and stop investing for your own sanity, investing isn’t for everyone and that’s fine.

Equally recognise you bought at the end of a bull market and things are stabilising and may even dip a lot more, if that’s okay with you then carry on, if this isn’t okay for you then you need to do more DD before investing.",boxing8753,112,/r/stocks/comments/n65x7r/i_started_investing_in_february_2021_how_do_i/gx54dr5/,0.089,0.817,0.095,0.1349
2,GME," I also started investing recently as the GME thing was going on. I expected losses and considered it the cost of learning how to do this shit. I’m now down around -$1500 from a $8800 starting point.  While I’d obviously prefer to NOT be down, I feel like I’m doing OK given that I’m learning as I go. 

Diversification is key and learning how to do research is obviously important but I have to admit that it seems to me so far that the fundamentals of a company don’t necessarily mean it will perform well day to day. I know they are still important metrics so I stay invested in the stock even if it is down. There have been too many times I have cut my losses only to watch the stock value bounce back a couple days later. 

Stick with it.  None if us with only a few months experience should expect to be making hand over fist kind of money.",DongRickles,12,/r/stocks/comments/n65x7r/i_started_investing_in_february_2021_how_do_i/gx5bl7q/,0.063,0.821,0.116,0.784

4,GME," Here’s my take as someone who’s also down 40% of my initial investment. I started investing in mid 2019 with a very small investment of about $100 to get my feet wet as I was barely starting to learn the very basics of trading. I honestly wasn’t very active and held through for a while without making too many changes. I practically forgot about my portfolio and didn’t check Robinhood for like a year and a half. I made a nice couple of bucks from holding Aphria, Snapchat, and Sony. My mentality and strategy changed in early January of this year when I got back into trading actively as I started to hear about the GME craze. I hopped on the bandwagon and rode the wave up, but I held on for too long as I didn’t know when to take gains. It was too new for me seeing an insane profit thinking about how much higher it could go. Fast forward a few weeks and things crash, I doubled down, rode the wave back up and got greedy again missing my chance. Throughout the time I was trying to catch every new WSB hype play and depositing more and more money. I learned about options and started gambling on risky plays. As they say the first hit is free and I was addicted when I got my first 400% return on a few small plays. It wasn’t enough to counter my losses in premiums and selling bad stock purchases. I’ve put in about $8.3k and am down $3.2k. Since then I’ve spent more time doing my own research and read the news everyday. I took the time to analyze where I went wrong and I’ve learned to hold onto plays I have higher conviction in and to take gains when I should. I have a bit to go before breaking even, but I know I can get back there with a more risk averse strategy and hedging. Sometimes you have know when to let go and when to avg down and buy the dip. It will help if you don’t check your portfolio every single day if your plays are high conviction long holds. I’m still swing trading and holding long, but I’ve taken my losses and learned from them. I’m sure you can too.",JustaNetherHero,2,/r/stocks/comments/n65x7r/i_started_investing_in_february_2021_how_do_i/gx675xo/,0.087,0.801,0.112,0.7548

6,PLTR," Be it a lesson. Admit to yourself that you had no reasons to invest into the things that you did. In other words, you gambled. Investing is something when you go and check the balance sheet of the company, and then determine if the valuation of the business makes sense.

11,DD," Thinking there is no tommorow, only today doesn't help anyone.

There is lessons you need to learn i already knew about. If you time the market, buy some stocks, your buy in price better be decent.

A while ago every single post was about Palantir, BlackBerry, Nio, post after post after post after post, it just went on for days, months, eternity.

And look at that, after soul crushing long wait the retribution day is here, reddit hype stocks on 40% discount, time to buy is now while normies are bleeding crazy red. Its not time to buy when everyone is happy and driving on endless hype, well it always depends on situation.

For example while i was late on GME stock when it first hit 40$, the upsides and risk taken overweight everything else, and after the long weekend i bought in, sold later around 300$, but at some point there i wanted to buy in again. I mean i am not some wise guru, if the short squeeze happens the stock rises endlessly with no ceiling, fucking moon is not the ceiling, it would rise out of solar system, but i didn't buy in because buying a stock after 7000% rise up no matter the hype and doing all the DD went against everything i known, i said good luck to everyone else and soul crushingly avoided buying in it again. Lessons i learned let me escape with insane profit while the masses piled in with their buy in price above 300$ just before disaster.

I am not sure if you can just simply ride out the storm, you have to learn the lessons given at you, you have to think, analyze and not do any dumb shit anymore, nobody is going to make me back 4k i lost on a dumb ass penny stock in 10 sec for the most dumbest reason to invest in it there could be, there was just no sun shine, no silver lining, there was just pain and reality, but you know, after year of good decisions after good decisions, i can say those 4k doesn't matter to me, just a blip in history, my mind doesn't ever go there, what would that money be, what could i done with it ? ehh, i did well afterwards with everything i learned, in twisted way soul crushing loses just helped me.

If you are thinking about selling at a loss then I'm not sure why you put money in the stock market instead of the roulette wheel. Keep in mind the market is at an ATH like 90% of the time, so buying in at ATH isn't a bad thing. Buying in at ATH and selling when it goes down is the bad thing.

16,MSFT," Invest in multiple strong companies that you have strong confidence will still be here in 10 years. 

Then check their ""P/E"" ratio and make sure it is not wildly out of line with its peer companies. Google is \~26, Apple is \~29, Amazon is \~62, MSFT is 31. 

Amazon is a crazy outlier there, so make sure you understand why they are an outlier before buying the stock. This might require digging into financials, etc. 

However, do not chase low PE or high PE companies! It's just a rough way to see what premium the market is willing to pay for a share of profits. 

One way to think of PE ratio is that this is the number of dollars of stock you must buy to own $1 of their profits per year. (PE ratio changes over time, of course)

If you were not invested in several strong companies, it's a good time to cut the meme stocks and pivot into a long term growth mindset.",thisdude415,1,/r/stocks/comments/n65x7r/i_started_investing_in_february_2021_how_do_i/gx5t5mp/,0.032,0.765,0.204,0.9821

If it’s the stocks I’m thinking of you need to DYOR more and realize why those stocks are called “meme stocks.” It’s because they’re joke companies that ran up, meaning they’ll run down just as big. 


A book on stock picking to get you started on the right track would be “One Up On Wall Street” by Peter Lynch. You can also watch Warren Buffett/Charlie Munger interviews when he gives advice, I find those to sometimes be helpful.

36,TX," Trying to make money in days or months is timing the market.  It’s literally gambling.  There is no guaranteed way to win this.  As many people end up wiped out as winning big. Long term, this mentality makes less than slow and steady investment, even for winners.

You make money by buying low and selling high.  The market is high, so you won’t realize gains unless you gamble lucky, or wait until recovery from the market correction that will happen once the CA -> TX housing exodus finishes in a year or two.

Buying one or three stocks is gambling.  You need to hedge your bets.  I like funds better.  ETF or mutual.  It lets you buy lots of stocks with less money, and professional managers work to keep value and objectives.

Dollar cost averaging is a cool term.  You buy in regularly, so as things dip, you buy cheaper, and as things grow, you gain.  You might think it nets zero, but over time, it grows.  Doubling every ~10 years is normal.

For “to the moon” kind of investing, that is gambling, and discussed in /r/WallStreetBets .  Plenty of horriffic losses and insane gains. Never bet what you cannot lose.

To my limited experience stocks can make a comeback unless the business is completely defunct and/or the industry is not profiting.

For example I started investing in 2008 right before it crashed or was it 2006? I held on and my Cisco that had lost half it's value ended up growing to over 50 percent of what I bought it at (this took years mind you).

DSX on the other hand I bought around $10-15 and it's still worth next to nothing. Sold that only to buy into it again this year and go from $2 to less than that.

It helps when you only put in money you can afford to lose and/or when you put in $1 and it goes to $10 you sell $1 to recoup your principle and then you can worry less.",RogueShogun21,1,/r/stocks/comments/n65x7r/i_started_investing_in_february_2021_how_do_i/gx6pe4t/,0.078,0.844,0.077,-0.0475

41,DD," 

whatever DD or insight you think you have is all info that just helps you sleep at night.

The way to do it in all market conditions is risk management.

If you take the approach that you can lose 30-50% over a 6-18 month time frame, itll help you in ticker selection and position size.

People who tell you ""invest for the long term"" are often examples of people who are ignoring the risk present and have trader bias. They also tend not to realize the real underlying reasons why stocks tend to move up and down.

Is betting on a large US tech stock with a massive consumer base a decent bet? absolutely. Can this company lose 30-50% of its value at any time? absolutely.

Just because you think a company will be around 3-5 years, does not mean people will value it the same way as you do.

GME also got me into investing, but one of the first lessons I learned was to not go all in on meme-stocks (or anything for that matter).

Sure, the bulk of my holdings is GME, but I'm also diversifying into slower but surer growth stocks with mostly reliable companies as well.

If I were to ignore how wildly my GME holdings affects my overall portfolio, I would actually be securely (as far as that word goes in the stock market) up about 5-ish% in just the last month, which, yeah, I'm not rich and I'm not retiring early or anything, but that's also not too bad considering that I'm still an amateur at this.",mythrilcrafter,3,/r/stocks/comments/n65x7r/i_started_investing_in_february_2021_how_do_i/gx6056b/,0.041,0.801,0.159,0.9558

51,DD," You’re **fine** most of us are buying those stocks right now (I for one am bullish af on ARKK and NFLX) first and foremost, before you invest another dime you need to put in the time to learn about some companies you love and believe in and decide if you want to invest in their future. Given what you owned before try researching Square, Paypal, Coinbase, and Riot.

Now on to your current positions, I will try and give you my DD on them short and long term.

**Short term** *aka wth happened to them*
In Q1 of this year the market rotated from tech/growth (your stuff) to re-opening stocks. Don’t panic, you’re in good stuff, you just timed your entry badly. Patience will very likely solve this mistake on its own, if you believe in those holdings now could be a good opportunity to add to them. (But learn more first as I said above) do not panic and switch to re-opening stuff, “chasing the trade” rarely works.

**Long term** *will this be forever?*
I hold two of the five tickers you mentioned and I plan to have them for years. The market will rotate back into tech / growth it just needs to cool down a bit because it was overbought during the pandemic. How do I know investors will come back to the tech sector (and specifically the stuff ARKK holds?)

What else are they gonna do? **not** invest in the future???

I’m also a highly contrarian investor so Wallstreet’s jealousy of Cathy Wood’s gains and criticism of her methods makes me more interested in her fund not less. Try reading some of ARKK’s investor communications you can learn a lot from them.

**final thought** if none of the tickers I suggested make your heart soar and your mind sing, then consider the three following options while you continue learning.

1. Hold cash (yes I know inflation is scary but it doesn’t happen overnight)

2. Dollar cost average into an index fund for the next year+ until you find something more appealing

3. Continue doing what you were doing before",KrazieKanuck,27,/r/stocks/comments/n65x7r/i_started_investing_in_february_2021_how_do_i/gx5qhtc/,0.054,0.895,0.051,-0.5087

85,IMO, Dude I’m up about 150% YOY and it continues to climb. Went to school for investments theory focus was derivatives and have been trading for about 10 or 12 years now. To me doing all the analysis yourself on a company’s financials is worthless since there are investment banking analysts who have already done this. Waste of time when you can use their data to inform initial decisions on what to buy/sell. Learn options inside and out. IMO if there’s a stock you want to invest in there is ALWAYS a smart way to do that with options in the equation some way or another. I play each underlying based on how I can take advantage of an underlying with different options and sometimes stock combo strategies,mashunit12,31,/r/stocks/comments/n5zbxh/im_up_80_yoy_and_learned_i_dont_know_anything/gx594hl/,0.047,0.889,0.064,0.0644

I’m in the long game right now though and not changing positions until I’ve been in them at least a year for tax purposes.  There are some exceptions where I’ve gotten out of losing positions.  I tend to look at what a company is holding or has acquired, what they’re doing with it, and leaning towards things I know something about. One example was seeing that HPE bought out Cray Inc and is using it to get new business. That pick has beat overall market returns but is balanced by positions that have lost.

91,AU, Yeah I mean I use WSJ and Nasdaq.com that give nice summaries of anything you really need to know. If you’re trying to learn options tastyworks is the best resource. Disclaimer they merely teach you about selling premium so you understand better though. From there I’ve formed my own strategies based on the underlying. For example AU I’ve literally just sold strangles and straddles bc I know gold is a commodity and there is a cap on how high/low it will go. I’ve reduced my basis in the underlying over 2k dollars over the last year just doing that. A lot of my high growth plays I’m more or less initiating positions long call and covering that position with a short that covers 50% or higher of the long premium. This allows me to take significant profits if delta moves against me and then roll out the long for a better deal at the reduced deltas,mashunit12,6,/r/stocks/comments/n5zbxh/im_up_80_yoy_and_learned_i_dont_know_anything/gx5mwsa/,0.0,0.848,0.152,0.9713

136,CLF," The thing is, your attitude is the same attitude as the analysts who don't believe in steel.

A week ago, CLF was trading at the same stock price it did at the start of the year. Back then steel futures were ~900. Now they're reaching $1600, and the price a week ago had barely moved. 

Even though steel futures weren't priced in, whales and big players weren't buying in because their analysts were telling them that steel is a short-term play, these profits are temporary, until production catches up to shortages.

Those knowledgeable about the steel industry, know at best it will be many months until shortage problems are over. And with enormous fundamental changes to steel coming like Chinese export reduction, global infrastructure bills, these problems are going to be exacerbated, and for many years.

PLUS steel companies learned their lessons in the past. They won't overproduce. At the end of the day, steel companies are bringing in billions, their stock price hasn't been reflecting that despite the melt up, because analysts don't believe it to continue. But every month futures go up, every month where steel has record breaking earnings, every credit upgrade of steel companies, it doesn't matter what analysts think - steel companies are extremely profitable, bringing in billions, using it to expand or give back to shareholder, and with no end in sight to the bullish steel market, anyone buying in now is getting in early.

138,CLF," Sure. I've been working for the past few hours, just now coming back to see all of the wonderful activity on the thread. I don't have time to answer everyone but you ask a good question.

-------------------------------

**Potential downsides for both MT and CLF (steel in general):**

* Inflation doesn't happen and tech resurges. People keep throwing their money at high P/E growth companies and steel doesn't climb that fast, even with record profits. Profits don't increase share prices, demand for shares increases share price.

* A new COVID variant ignores vaccines and the world goes back into lockdown. Construction will slow tremendously, and with that, steel purchases.

* General market collapse. This is a long term play. I'm buying Jan 2022 LEAPS because I expect profit to keep coming, Q2, Q3, Q4 of 2021 and on. If the overall market collapses (there are plenty of whispers about this ""everything is too overvalued"" etc) then we won't get the max return from this play. I may be holding LEAPS in October when the Feds abruptly raise rates and everything falls 30%. Note: Feds have stated that they're keep rates low for a long time, the understanding to be at least all of 2021 and 2022.

* It is a short lived commodity cycle and we are at the peak. In my opinion this is the least likely event as we have steel futures to tell us that prices are expected to be high for months/years.

-------------------------------------------------

**Potential downsides for just CLF:**

* The loss of the CEO. Lourenco Goncalves is an amazing long-term CEO, the center of CLF, and if he were to pass away in a car accident tomorrow the stock would react poorly.

* CLF spent a bunch of money to acquire Arcelor Mittal's US facilities last year. It made them the largest flat-rolled steel producer in North America but also saddled them with some debt (and MT now owns 78M CLF shares!). So they have debt, but they are paying it down aggressively so if there is a downturn in future years, they will survive it easily. The debt may make some investment funds hesitate, although companies like U.S. Steel are far far worse off and would be screwed.

* Steel tarrifs make it more expensive to import foreign steel into the U.S. If Biden repeals the United States steel tariffs, CLF will instantly lose a huge competetive advantage. That said, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said recently, ""Those tariffs have worked in so far as they have leveled the playing field for American producers of steel and aluminum. I'm not saying they're perfect. They created other challenges, but the fact of the matter is, China doesn't play fair.""

* The Infrastrucure Bill falls through. While steel doesn't depend on this, it is a nice bonus that would be missed. The failure of the bill would mean we wouldn't see those steel profits and also may trigger a price drop in CLF.",ParrotMafia,12,/r/stocks/comments/n67yep/has_tech_got_you_down_consider_commodities_in/gx67v8x/,0.122,0.746,0.132,0.7085

When parks make a comeback and we have a ton of streaming subscribers it will be much more valuable.
Plus Disney barely scratches Gaming, if they are smart about it they could grow a ton more in this direction, very cheaply if they partner up with good studios and a gaming brand.

181,AAPL," Compare DIS to similar companies. DIS is weird to measure because its a combination of:

- online streaming platform
- resorts and cruises
- merchanidising
- theme parks
- media and production company

I think its really hard to value DIS personally, even though I'm super bullish.

Lets compare each of those sectors to market leaders via mkt cap:

Online Streaming: NFLX $220Bn

Cruises: CCL $30Bn

Theme Parks: SIX $3Bn

Media and Production: VIAC $24Bn

If you add up all those individual companies and made a chimera, you'd have a mkt cap of 277Bn.

DIS is trading at $330Bn mkt cap right now. So do you believe that DIS is worth more than all those companies combined? Its not apples-to-apples, but valuing DIS is just as difficult as valuing SONY or AAPL. When a company has so many different revenue streams, it can get complicated where the valuations go.

Just be aware that DIS bought Marvel in 2009. Back then DIS was trading at $23. After that purchase, DIS rallied to $90 then stayed for 5 years, pushing as high as $144 before the COVID crash.

So the question is, how much of the Marvel + StarWars + Fox catalogue is already baked into the price. And how much is left to grow.

I think we saw lots of reopening stocks rally in November in preparation for Joe Biden presidency and a strong push for vaccinations. We're seeing lots of reopening already priced in.

Also, don't forget that DIS operates many of its revenue streams in pretty shit margins.


Some additional history, DIS did FY2020 annual report on November 12. That week DIS jumped from $120 to $140 and rallied to $180 over the next few weeks.

https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/app/uploads/2020/11/q4-fy20-earnings.pdf

Look at page 3 where you can see the revenue breakdown by sector. You can see that their parks/experiences revenue was down 37% yoy and studio entertainment was down 13% yoy. Even if DIS posts a 100% yoy revenue increase in both those sectors in 2021 (which seems currently impossible), the cagr will only be 15% yoy growth compared to 2019.

With that all said, would you say that 15% yoy revenue growth justify a stock price increase in 2020 from $140 to $180 in 2020 (approx 30% increase)?

I think DIS will trade sideways for at least 2 more years until COVID totally clears up. Until then, I would say that online streaming revenues are priced in, along with the upcoming Marvel gen4 releases and all other things.

268,PLTR," That’s not how stocks work. Good news doesn’t just mean a stock goes up. 

Stocks are priced based on what people will pay for them. There’s no central agency that says a stock is worth $X price. So what people are willing to pay for stocks is based on what they think it’s worth paying for. 

So Palantir was worth $10 six months ago because that’s what people thought it was worth. Then it exploded in price to $40 because people thought it was worth significantly more. 

Now, it’s sitting at $20 because people think that’s what it’s worth. 

Now, answering your specific question - why aren’t these contracts changing the price of PLTR for the better? It’s because they aren’t changing people’s perspectives on what it’s worth. 

I’ll give you an example. If you have a $40k car and you take it to the car wash, that’s pretty good, right? Well, that doesn’t really change the value of the car for me. So I wouldn’t suddenly want to buy your car for $41k. Same with scheduled oil changes or changing the tires - kinda expected you to do those things, right? 

Now, if you crashed the car or you upgraded it significantly in a way that I wanted, that’s unexpected and would change the value.

This means their profits are not likely to grow as they're not going to be able to continue underwriting as many loans as they are now. 2020 was likely a high. Will they grow long-term? Sure.

472,RKT," I'm in real estate, and there are 20 buyers for every seller in my market. It's a crazy time in the market. Higher rates will crimp people, but they're not that high relative to rates pre-pandemic. A few years ago, I had a mortgage at 3 3/8%, and everyone I knew was over 4%. I refinanced at 2 3/8%, and I'm glad I did. 

I don't think it's realistic to expect ultra low rates forever, but I don't think interest rates ticking up will mean people will stop buying houses. I agree the rush to refi may have passed, and that's ok. Higher rates might mean there are 14 or 16 buyers for every seller, but houses will still be bought and sold. 

RKT is making some other strategic moves to cement its position, including proprietrary software, auto loans, etc., that should help offset some of the 'slow down' in refinancing.

482,RKT," That’s pretty well explained.

Quicken Loans specializes in writing shitty loans that are super high risk for default. Barely any credit score or down payment requirement. If you have a job and can sign your name - you’re probably going to qualify for a loan regardless of your credit history.

So - the reply is saying - some of these loans that RKT are giving - should the housing market take a turn (which is likely on some level) and these loans start to go belly up RKT/Quicken are the first loans that will likely go sideways given their requirement to secure a loan is lower than most traditional mortgage loaning companies.

You should try BERK-B or VOO or VTI. But EBIX and VIAC is pretty undervalued for example. I know huge gains in a short time and shiny techy stuff sounds intriguing but I think if you earned enough money and you don’t want to risk the bubble to pop, then look for other investments.

512,FSLY," What is a good valuation?

NET got clobbered today because FSLY put up weak growth numbers and the market reacted heavily.

NET was trading at $25 before the COVID mess took over, and its been on a 3x rocket ship trajectory ever since.

NET has higher margins than FSLY, operates in a more diverse space and has a different value proposition. With a wider base of customers and larger margins, NET may fair better than FSLY in earnings.

That being said, what is a good valuation for NET in your opinion?

The lowest NET has gotten in the past 6 months is $61 on March 8 at the bottom of the bump.

Do you think that's a fair price for NET?

I'm a big holder of NET, and have been adding over the past year. Its a shame to see it get blown up and caught up in the recently reversion to mean of cloud stocks.

As a relative measure, on February 11 NET had their annual report. Their revenue was $431M, up 50% yoy with a cagr of 50% yoy for 5 years. To maintain that growth, NET needs to put up revenues of about $160M. The current estimates are about $130M. If NET misses this price at all, I think it free-falls all teh way to the low 50's.

They're definitely an expensive company, and depending on your horizons getting in at $60 may be a good entry. But with a volatile stock like this, consider a DCA strategy since it can bounce around a lot.

If you do decide to lump sum into NET, consider buying PUTS to hedge against short term bounces.",radarbot,18,/r/stocks/comments/n6c01m/cloudflare_jump_in_or_wait/gx6d6l0/,0.039,0.88,0.081,0.8587

NET is my second biggest holding. If there were no tax consequences, I would have sold some of them already, but I do believe in the company long term. I would not be surprised if it dips below 40 in the short/medium term.

I'm fairly confident they'll beat earnings if you look at charts like this as a proxy for marketshare: https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/proxy/all (it is still steadily increasing at the same rate).

Maybe next time I'll just take the win and deal with taxes afterwards.

Either way, I believe in NET longterm for sure. Their new products, adoption and expansion is legit. And they have a great leadership team.

This is cheap compared to last year but now even growth companies that have a P/S at 10 and less are sold off like there is no tomorrow even with 30-50% growth.

It's a bit like valuations didn't matter to the upside a year ago but now valuations don't matter even if they are super cheap as long as you are somewhere in tech.

I believe the ROI on a ""new"" Tesla Model 3 is somewhere between five and seven years now and the up-front cost of a new Tesla is far out of reach for the average consumer (and that's including the price of electricity over the time-span).  However, there are ways to get that lower by buying a Bolt or LEAF instead, but those cars are considerably less sexy than a Tesla or Mach-E.  You could also generate your own electricity, but that only increases up-front costs.

The good news is, it's not impossible to work on or maintain your own electric vehicle.  There are plenty of people out there ""hacking"" and modifying Teslas, so even maintenance costs will eventually come down for EVs.

I see the recall as a short-term blip for them, and wonder if it’s being overblown a bit in terms of the impact. There is probably a decent population of people with the tread that won’t bother doing anything with the recall since they don’t have young kids or pets, or they have the tread situated somewhere where they don’t go. So yes, all the treads are recalled but not “all” will actually have the customers take them up on it, and those won’t lead to any costs for PTON.

In the latter, I think some will just wait for the guard or whatever piece they opt to add to fix it, or maybe it’s just a software update, and some will take PTON up on the offer to come out for free and move to another room in the house that’s less accessible by kids/pets.",jamminxc,3,/r/stocks/comments/n5x2r2/how_far_will_pton_fall_do_i_buy_some_back_or_stay/gx3yf87/,0.015,0.889,0.096,0.9001

589,ED," TL;DR: lots of competition, low barrier of entry, beware. 

The fundamental question you have to ask is what does Teledoc offer than any health plan, health system, provider organization or otherwise can't do themselves?

Competition is fierce and barriers to entry are slim. Health plans simply can just contract telemedicine terms with their existing network of providers... Providers literally just need Zoom, or Teams, for hell, Google Meet if they are really in the poor house! and as the quote indicates, if there is not ready access to member's overall health records, well... what is the point here?

Health plans already have the records system, they already have actuaries, they already have analytics. 

What teledoc had, was a window of time before a pandemic where they could offer a service at below standard provider rates which would then save the health plans money. They could argue they would prevent ED visits and save them more money. But that window of time has eroded and I am not sure teladoc has their use case any longer. Some states are even out there actively making it harder on teladoc, by legislating telemedicine be reimbursed at in-person rates.

The $83 spent on the contract can be thought of as an insurance premium. You pay $83 to insure that no matter how much the price of GME falls, you are guaranteed a price of at least $155.

If GME were to go bankrupt and end up completely worthless ($0 shares), without the put you would lose all $16300.  With the put, you now only lose $883.  $83 from the price of the contract, and $800 from selling at a price $8 lower than what you started at.

There are two main uses for option: 1. Speculation when you don't have a position in the underlying shares and 2. Hedging when you do have a position.

You don't need to have those shares if you plan on buying a put option and then selling it when ITM. You need those shares only if you plan on *writing* covered options, which means selling the option yourself (from your personal portfolio) and enabling whoever buys that option from you to exercise and get your 100 shares. Writing puts is the opposite of buying puts, you want the stock to *NOT* drop in order to retain your shares and collect the premium. Of course if you don't have the shares you will have to buy them at market price.",Lissus92,4,/r/stocks/comments/n6cuq2/can_someone_explain_how_to_make_money_buying/gx6dbt5/,0.039,0.81,0.15,0.9294

608,AAPL," One bad luck black swan event and you're entire portfolio will go to zero. A 20% drawdown will be become a 40% draw down due to margin call.

Imagine you went into FAANG on margin last week when AMZN, GOOG, AAPL and MSFT blew out earnings. They all pumped, and you said: fuck it, lets do it.

Since then, depending on your stock profile, you could have eaten 15% losses in the market. AMZN is down 10% from its peak, and so is AAPL and MSFT. Imagine getting margin called and those 15% losses now turning into 30% because you were on margin. Could you stomach that loss?

This is a risky idea because the over leverage will create an uneven risk/reward ratio for the potential upside. So if FAANG grows at 10% this year, and your margin interest rate is 9%, and VOO grows at 10%, then what? You're taking on huge 50% loss risks for 9% additional gains. That doesn't feel like its worth it IMHO.

In my opinion, margin is more used for short term swing plays where you have greater confidence in the movement. Not for long term holds unless you can absorb that level of risk.

How quickly can you get $200k again? Because if you can't do it fast, then you're going to dick yourself pretty hard.

635,DCF," I agree but don’t think points 1 or 2 are indicators or an imminent crash. The Buffett Indicator is a poor indication of when a market will correct. It just tells you if things are overvalued. The government is always spending astronomical sums of money. It doesn’t matter if the money comes directly through stimulus checks or buying military equipment, to the economy it’s the same. Someone is the beneficiary who should spend the money and grow the economy. 

I think the driving force behind a downturn will be inflation and interest rates. We’ve already started to see signs of inflation with commodities like copper and lumber skyrocketing. We’re seeing shortages in chips for electronics. All of these point to higher prices coming. Higher prices means people start asking for raises, which cause high prices. The fed will have to raise interest rates. This hits stocks a few ways: 1) the higher cost of inputs and labor cut into profits as not all cost increases can be passed on the consumers 2) increased prices reduce demand so sales drop 3) higher interest rates make interest payment more expensive, again hitting bottom lines 4) increased interest rates means discount rates for DCF calculations should increase causing valuations to go down. 

Key dates: May 12 (then June 10) is the next CPI report. I think if inflation is higher than anticipated, the market sells off hard. If it comes in around expectations, the market could cautiously move higher until the June CPI report.",FailingEfficiency,1,/r/stocks/comments/n5rkvv/like_it_or_not_it_looks_like_a_market_crash_is/gx3vd28/,0.066,0.784,0.15,0.977
636,GME," I think that was down to new investors entering the arena.

Let’s face it, people got bored in lockdown, and when people heard there was money to be made in the stock market, they rushed to it.

I think GME (sorry to mention it) also had a part to play. People saw how others became entire millionaires from it and got the illusion that it is quick and easy to make money.",maximalsimplicity,-5,/r/stocks/comments/n5rkvv/like_it_or_not_it_looks_like_a_market_crash_is/gx2w3tk/,0.029,0.899,0.072,0.4939
637,AAPL," Thanks for your comment.

I’ll be entirely honest, I haven’t been in the markets for a great deal of time either, but the recent movement is unsettling. Companies are announcing amazing quarters, but the stock is barely making a move.

AAPL is a great example, they announced a great quarter last week and the stock barely held.

Ultimately, the reasons that were existent months back are starting to materialise in my opinion.",maximalsimplicity,-2,/r/stocks/comments/n5rkvv/like_it_or_not_it_looks_like_a_market_crash_is/gx2xt95/,0.0,0.724,0.276,0.9758

641,ATH," >I cannot help but recognize if Trump was still in the white house. The media would hound him none stop about crashing the stock market. Yet I never see anyone critical of Biden and his tax policies. Why is there no pressure to call him out.

Because the stock market isn't crashing, the s&p is like 1.5% off its all time high and is up 9% since February.

Nasdaq is down 5% from all time high which is hardly crashing, and is about flat since February.

Russell 3000 is down about 2% from ATH and is up about 9% since February

Russell 2000 is down about 6% from ATH and is up 4% since February.
