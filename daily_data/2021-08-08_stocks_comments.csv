2,ASML, Looking at companies below $500B because I think above that would be considered too close I'd say ASML most likely to go above $1 Trillion with outsiders being Disney and Intel. I think Disney has a good chance of doubling in value in 5 years but that would still put them short and Intel needs the stars to align but at least they're in an industry where 5X is theoretically possble in 5 years while most other companies don't even have a theoretical chance.,HeartfireSR,166,/r/stocks/comments/p0aylx/which_stock_currently_well_below_a_1_trillion/h85j0oq/,0.0,0.906,0.094,0.6858

AMD still lagging behind intel in case of data center cpus but their share of that industry is growing fast (they have cheaper and better cpus).

They are already competing and their cars are pretty terrible. They have worse specs for higher prices with endlessly worse software.

But then again, I'm not an expert on the topic. You may be right that they prefer Shopify for some reason I've overlooked.

164,AR," Fair enough, this comment of yours is a far cry from the kind of zealous overconfidence the other guy’s parent comment I first replied to showed.  And the stock has a lot of people in that camp.  I could see it 5x’ing in 10 years if they nail execution AND the general market sees a continued 10 year bull run, but they are just not near the infrastructure required to pass an inflection point on their share price in the near term.

Me personally, I do have a relatively large risk tolerance.  My view on GS is not a speculative = bad opinion.  I made a huge bet on MVIS last June that has paid off handsomely.  The company was on the verge on bankruptcy and their only product was under NDA from Microsoft.  I believe that AR is the future (they have the light engine in the most compelling AR device currently available in the world) and I realized their laser based scanning technology would translate perfectly to the emerging LiDAR space, which they had been developing for a few years.  There is a post in my post history from a year ago where I explain why I think it was a good bet.  Luckily the market has since agreed with me.

Around that same time I invested a lot in Clean.Spark, which is a microgrid company.  I saw that energy management is a big issue and thought that grid infrastructure would be a growing industry.  This was also a bet on a democrat administration being friendly to clean energy initiatives before the election.  So certainly some luck involved, and then I got really lucky when they announced a Bitcoin mining initiative last December which ballooned their valuation, using their energy software as a proof of concept and to also achieve one of the lowest cost mining operations in the US with 95% clean energy.  Also a believer in clean energy in general and have long term positions in RUN and some uranium companies (more mid-term here).

I have some money in GENI but think it may be a little overvalued, but I like the sports betting industry and expect that to grow a lot in the next 10 years.

Half of my portfolio is now in SPY (30%) and big tech (20%) though, not including my 401k which is all broad market.  I converted about half of my MVIS and CL.SK profits there earlier this year.  There is really not much that needs to be said about big tech in my opinion.  They are behemoths in profit, intangibles, and also have a lock on a lot of next generation technology.

165,CL," Fair enough, this comment of yours is a far cry from the kind of zealous overconfidence the other guy’s parent comment I first replied to showed.  And the stock has a lot of people in that camp.  I could see it 5x’ing in 10 years if they nail execution AND the general market sees a continued 10 year bull run, but they are just not near the infrastructure required to pass an inflection point on their share price in the near term.

Me personally, I do have a relatively large risk tolerance.  My view on GS is not a speculative = bad opinion.  I made a huge bet on MVIS last June that has paid off handsomely.  The company was on the verge on bankruptcy and their only product was under NDA from Microsoft.  I believe that AR is the future (they have the light engine in the most compelling AR device currently available in the world) and I realized their laser based scanning technology would translate perfectly to the emerging LiDAR space, which they had been developing for a few years.  There is a post in my post history from a year ago where I explain why I think it was a good bet.  Luckily the market has since agreed with me.

Around that same time I invested a lot in Clean.Spark, which is a microgrid company.  I saw that energy management is a big issue and thought that grid infrastructure would be a growing industry.  This was also a bet on a democrat administration being friendly to clean energy initiatives before the election.  So certainly some luck involved, and then I got really lucky when they announced a Bitcoin mining initiative last December which ballooned their valuation, using their energy software as a proof of concept and to also achieve one of the lowest cost mining operations in the US with 95% clean energy.  Also a believer in clean energy in general and have long term positions in RUN and some uranium companies (more mid-term here).

I have some money in GENI but think it may be a little overvalued, but I like the sports betting industry and expect that to grow a lot in the next 10 years.

Half of my portfolio is now in SPY (30%) and big tech (20%) though, not including my 401k which is all broad market.  I converted about half of my MVIS and CL.SK profits there earlier this year.  There is really not much that needs to be said about big tech in my opinion.  They are behemoths in profit, intangibles, and also have a lock on a lot of next generation technology.

171,GM," You say you've spent lots of time looking into Tesla, but everything you wrote is either false or based on skimming MSM headlines.

> They don’t have the economies of scale

This is the most ridiculous statement I have ever read. Tesla is the only automaker in the world with economies of scale. They make the most EVs, the number of EVs they deliver every quarter continues to increase, and they are opening new factories in Berlin and Austin next year in order to satisfy demand. They are and will continue to grow explosively.

Meanwhile, Ford and GM's Q2 sales declined YoY which is disturbing because we were in the middle of the pandemic in 2020 when the economy was already depressed. They canceled their chip contracts last year because they foresaw lower demand due to the pandemic lockdowns. And now they don't have enough chips to fuel their production lines. Like all legacy auto, they only prepare 1 quarter in advance. They do not think years ahead like Tesla.

> They’re mired in controversy over bad business decisions (for e.g. for bailing out one of Musks other companies when it wasn’t in the Tesla shareholders interest)

More than 85% of shareholders approved the acquisition. The entire lawsuit was frivolous. That the news even covered this was obviously bait for clicks and views, which you happily swallowed.

> They’re high debt

How can you say this seriously? Tesla has negative debt, meaning they have more cash than debt. If they wanted to they could pay off all their bonds immediately. But they are busy building new factories to satisfy all the demand for their vehicles. Not to mention developing the 4680 batteries which will power their future $25,000 sedan.

Meanwhile, Ford and GM have a combined debt of almost $250 billion. Everyone talks about how Tesla is worth more than all the automakers combined. You know what else is worth more than all the automakers combined? Ford and GM's CORPORATE BONDS.

For example, I am taking up a good 3 mins to write out this reply, even though it would have taken me 30 secs if I can simply transmit whatever I am saying vocally or directly from my brain.

295,FOR," Ok.

I only did TA on SOLR so here's what I got and this may help you decide what you want to do.

1. SOLR has always been a cheap stock and has a very short trading history. In July of 2019, the stock had a bull run after good earnings FOR TWO YEARS. Topping at high 0.70's. Meaning that the stock, even at it's best, does not trade with high volume. It is not liquid.
2. With earnings coming, you can only really expect one of two three things to happen with such illiquid stock:
   1. The stock continues stagnates until earnings.
   2. The stock breaks down before or after earnings and continues to drop to previous lows. 
   3. The stock breaks out and starts a bull run more likely after earnings.
3. The RSI is in the -30's. Means there is no trading strength in this stock. This means nobody trades it, which also means not too many are selling it, which is good for you.
4. Finally, the stock is overall very very slow at growth AND decay. If after earnings the numbers aren't good... maybe let it go- up to you of course.

Hope this helps.

It could easily be a shit-show in states with poor vaccine rates. 

Couple that with large scale nursing/healthcare worker strikes and we could be in a mess. (I live/work in NC and most of the big hospital systems mandated vaccine, resulting in employees quitting. Between that and the pathetic vaccine rate among non-MD/DO medical personnel…and it’s already dicey for those of us in healthcare.)

357,AAPL," I can't say much about your portfolio. I'm familiar with SPCE and SOFI, but can't in good conscience say that I've looked into them (nor your other 2) much.

As far as buying/selling, my view is that if you've done your homework (prior to buying) and you've watched a stock for a bit and you buy it and it goes down... Unless there is some dramatic reason for why it dropped, I wouldn't plan on selling to cut losses. If the company had good financials, steady growth, potential for more, experienced management, and a history, and everything you read and looked into about it was good..... Then consider the dip a discount (unless there is some unforeseen reason that caused it to drop and will continue to decline).
As far as buying at the right time, I'd say that is more on technical analysis (but I could be wrong - I am not very well versed in TA). If it's something you plan on holding for a while (meaning years) , it shouldn't matter too much when you buy.... Perhaps be cautious about buying soon before or after earnings reports. Being patient is usually a good idea... I am personally anxious to buy some AAPL, but I'm waiting for a pullback into the low 140s or even into 130s. That may never come though. Point is, if you have a chance to save money, you might as well do that. If a stock you like is climbing, wait for a bit of red before buying --- though this does come with the risk of it running up on you.
I think the phrase is ""time in the market, not timing the market"" or something like that. If you plan on holding for years, it won't matter if you save a few bucks on the initial purchase.

My only other advice would be to add stability to your account. Not sure how volatile your stocks are... I know SPCE is pretty much a meme stock, so be careful with that. But I would say add some blue chips to get steady growth in your account.

390,BABA," I have 0 exposure to emerging markets except for BABA.

Emerging market ETFs are full of companies with fraudulent accounting.  Its better to pick undervalued gems with good fundamentals from there.

For me, it was a toss up between Tencent and BABA.  Both are the largest venture capitalists in China, and they have investments in startups in other Asian countries as well.

To me, buying into one of these companies, is like buying an index of vetted companies.  You can search up Mohnish Pabrai and spawner stocks.

I chose BABA over Tencent because I believe BABA has a better competitive edge:

\-largest e-commerce player in China, already becoming a large player in other emerging markets like Turkey, Vietnam, Latin America

\-tied with Tencent for digital payments in China

\-largest cloud provider in China

Similar to western tech companies, BABA has successfully managed to expand from its core competency (e-commerce), and captured other areas of tech.  

If you consider how much a company like BABA has benefited from the covid pandemic, it would be absurd to think, such a company would be trading below its pre-pandemic Feb 2020 highs. 

Balance sheet looks great, no debt, 80 bil USD cash similar to FAAG companies.

Forward p/e of 17.

I started my BABA position in the 230s, and have been accumulating heavily in the 180s, 190s.  Currently have 142 shares with a cost basis of 208.

394,AMD," While I agree that these companies are overvalued, I also support the unpopular opinion of consolidating your portfolio into high-conviction picks. I would say to do some valuation models (considering multiple approaches) and risk analyses with your picks. I think you can find better value/growth picks and M&A targets in each of these sectors.

With that being said, I don't believe in diversification (especially if you're younger) because it can water down/cap your results. This is a good model for high net worth investors, as the growth on the arbitrage compounds, while reducing risks in any single stock. High concentration in quality picks can drastically change your results, in your wealth growth stage. So, it all depends on your time horizon and risk aversion.

Personally, I only ever hold a handful of stocks, in which I have done extensive research on and feel have room for large price appreciation.

Unless there is some planned obsolescence (eg: slowing down hardware with firmware updates to protect older screen from whatever reasons), the market might have reached saturation point in this competitive industry.

Also on the lookout for steady companies, probably with dividends, since I plan on holding long term and making profits on calls.",freelovew1,1,/r/stocks/comments/p06en2/dd_on_covered_call_stocks/h84qlhj/,0.0,0.811,0.189,0.9711

This screener would be a good place to start. I am also very interested in covered calls and perhaps even more so poor mans covered calls.

Will check back to see the replies!

EDIT: To add to the discussion, I will be doing this on my 100 STEM shares ($27) after earnings this Wednesday. Didn’t want to do a weekly and have my shares called if it spikes on good news.",OilerAC,1,/r/stocks/comments/p06en2/dd_on_covered_call_stocks/h84lls8/,0.054,0.761,0.185,0.8149
