It's coming from a certain vocal meme stock crowd (my prior response was removed by automod due to the low quality content on their sub which I referred to by name, sorry mods I didn't realize it was banned here but props to you guys for doing so). For whatever reason they think the banks are unstable, we're going to see a repeat of 2008 and somehow that will mean GME will experience the mother of all short squeezes....uhh somehow. I don't quite follow the logical leaps for this to be the case, but they've been on pretty much every trading sub spreading this theory that the banks are unstable.

12,RIDE," You dont know where its coming from? Are you educated at all in macro economics? You are really missing a lot of research and information. Banks are gobbling up any real estate they can find for 20-50% over market price from before COVID because the FED is buying mortgage backed securities at an alarming rate. Essentially propping up the housing bubble with nearly infinite amounts of Quantitate Easing. Hardly something to be bullish about. Especially when the demand for overpriced housing is falling.

14,GS," I wouldn't categorize their dealings with LTCM in the same bucket as Archegos.

They were *in bed* with Archegos. I forgot the actual figure but the amount they had out with GS must have put them within top 25 clients. LTCM went TO GS asking for help after Russia fucked their dumb position. Why not squeeze them?

On the shorting, from where I'm sitting - and I'm one greedy fuck - if it makes money it makes money. I have a fiduciary responsibility to make whatever money I can for me and my company, and if it's not in the CFA ethics guidelines I'm not bound by them.

18,DD," I started last year and made a good chunk of money to which then my parents begged me to take their money, made good money after that and then my GFs family begged me to take their money.

By today the first two accounts are up a good chunk but the third one is only up 5% from February to today.

WHAT HAVE I LEARNT?

People get deceived by the fact that I have a finance background + the returns I’ve had and think I’m a profesional or a wizard. Even when advising them against giving me money they’re all greedy

Managing others money is too much of a hassle for me. I enjoy managing my own money and doing my DD and stuff and I’m happy with whatever happens to me but with other peoples money you have the pressure from the expectations and the fact that obviously you dont want to lose their money.


I don’t even get payed for this nor do I want to because that only brings another layer of pressure. 


There are some things that I just do by “feel” like sizing positions that gets confusing when working with multiple account sizes 


Also some option strategies don’t work with smaller account sizes. 


MY CONCLUSIONS:

I’m being more quiet about the fact that I invest, I decline rudely to other people offering money and the accounts I have I’m switching them slowly to 100% SPY and occasionally I’ll sell covered puts on other tickers I’m following.

19,ATH," I was doing very well investing during post-pandemic 2020. At my ATH I was over 100% profit. 

As it was coming up I took over the investment account for a good friend of mine. He’s a doctor and business owner, and and parent of a young child. He was too busy to pay attention to the market, so he handed over his entire portfolio to me to control. We made an agreement that I’d get 15% of profits quarterly. 

Unfortunately I took over in August 2020, right before election FUD ramped up. Since then, I’ve only had one profitable quarter. 

Both my investments, and his, have fallen 40% this year. The market has gotten really tough to navigate lately. 

He’s gotten pretty worried and dissatisfied many times. It has been a ton of work. So many hours spent actively trading his account, like well over 100 hours. And in return I’ve received $2300, and lost my friend over $15K. 

Investing is not as easy as it seemed in 2020. It sucks losing your own money, and even worse losing other people’s money.

I’m still controlling his investment account and trying to make it grow, but it’s a big hurdle to overcome now. A 40% loss means you need a 67% gain to break even.

20,DD," Some people see that I trade and invest and are curious as to what I do. I then tell them some of the things that I do. To most people who have never heard of a P/E ratio, EPS, alpha, beta, delta, gamma, or theta, this all sounds like magic, so therefore, I must know what I am doing. I make sure to tell them times when I got lucky, and make sure to emphasize when I lost money so that they know that my strategies are not always accurate. Some ask if I could manage their money, or any stock tips. I tell them that if they are interested in how to trade and invest, then they should check out some free classes, videos, and educational resources that have helped me learn. Most people do not take any of the classes I suggest. One of my coworkers caught me checking out a REIT that I was interested in and just bought 10 shares (not much, but still) without any DD of his own. I don't even really suggest ETFs since they charge a fee and most of the companies within the fund will mimic the performance of the ETF anyway, but for someone to understand how to do proper DD on a prospective investment they have to spend some time knowing what makes a good investment which is honestly open to interpretation.

21,RMD," not really, i have a few coworkers who have asked for advice and i tell them just to use index funds.  voo vti vug vong sptm.   i also tell them that that is all of what i have, which is partially a lie,  i have now, after they've grown quite a bit, substantial long positions in leveraged ETFs,  UPRO, SSO, TQQQ, QLD, TECL, SOXL, FNGU, HIBL, FAS, UDOW.  i feel significantly less confident about recommending these, for various reasons.  most of my coworkers got very caught up in the recent crypto bubble.  i was always very dismissive of it, which i was totally comfortable about because it's 100% true that it's just naked speculation.  

with my family its a different dynamic.  they're relatively unengaged with investing.  they're good otherwise financially but i've taken a proactive interventionist approach.   in the 80s my mom sought out a  stockbroker and he's okay, sort of.  considering the time that it was she was lucky to find him, he didn't churn their account or totally fleece them or get them in crap that went to zero, but as investing has become democratized my opinion of his absolute value has declined.  he simply doesn't justify what he's charging them.  like my parents would almost certainly benefit from some roth conversions.  and since he is paid a percentage of AUM he wouldn't benefit to do that, and he hasn't done any.  

i got my sister to open a roth IRA with my mom's RMD.  at vanguard away from the stockbroker.  next year i plan to get her a retail account too.  when my dad dies or is too unfit to handle the finances and i take them over, i do intend to fire the stockbroker.",gabbagool3,1,/r/investing/comments/obxqxa/do_people_around_you_your_relatives_ask_you_to/h3rjzmd/,0.022,0.851,0.127,0.9796

I offered help to one sister in law because she needed it and that was it.  I discuss active investing opportunities with my son but he does his own thing.  My recommendation...

The other neighbor overheard us discussing one day and took an interest in one particular company I've invested in. She started to ask questions. Now she already has 401k, private broker, etc. When she spoke with her broker all he told her was the entire market was going to bust and wouldn't go further for what she was asking so she came home and asked me how to set up an account for her personal (not with her broker). I told her I would help her set up an account but I would do no trades/etc for her. She made the decision on her own knowing it was a penny stock and in for a long hold. Now she asks me to help her buy more because she doesn't know the interface well. She deposits her money every now and then and asks me to help her place her order. She knows I am not a financial advisor and I made it clear to her I was not responsible for the outcome.

43,LMT," I would SUGGEST:

VT & VOO for the long 20-30 year run.

>**What are your favorite ETFs**

I'm in different things than I would suggest because of my portfolio and personal risk/reward goals.

>ITA

Added to this with my position in LMT. Defensives were undervalued, a reopening play, a sort of inflation hedge since Uncle Sam can't stop spending on the US war machine, and also a potential future hedge against and my own China positions. This industry isn't something I'm very familiar with so I decided to go with an index for exposure.

>MORT

Dividends were just under 10% with upside to pre-covid levels. I also had 0 real estate exposure prior to this and decided to add in a small position.

>XLU	

Inflation hedge. This industry is something I'm familiar with, but haven't had great success with in the past so I opted to get wider exposure.

>GLD/SLV

Inflation hedge. Also personal reasons I won't go into.

>UWM

Bought around the 70-80 range pre-split when I thought R2K was one of the few laggards left not pumped up with capital. Happy with the results. People will mention the decay, potential drops, not buying leveraged ETFS, etcetc. I'll say I intend to watch and work out this position as we move into late cycle.

>EWZ

Early cycle commodity play. Brazil was one of the countries not doing well a few months back when we were getting vax'd and reopening. Rather than buying VOO while hitting all time highs, I thought it would be better to buy into Brazil given how wild commodity prices and inflation was. Also believe that Brazil will eventually get through covid like the US and their markets would rally then. USD is in a very strong position against the Brazilian real. Last thing is a geopolitical hedge. US & China made up +75% & +20% of my asset allocation before my EWZ position. Brazil benefits from exports to China/US as they try to grow, also in a position to play the 2 against each other, and Brazil would be largely immune US-CN see further escalation.",zxc123zxc123,3,/r/investing/comments/ocaxj7/what_are_your_favorite_etfs_for_a_25_year_timeline/h3tw1w5/,0.049,0.848,0.103,0.9639

Still down 93% from when it went public.

""QS -4 days""

They're not predicting to have product in cars until like 2025, where they're predicting $39M in revenue. So you have an entity that will not really have anything to show for a while - price volatility should be not surprising in the slightest for something like that. You might get to 2024/2025 and something else has come along, or it doesn't work as hoped. With all the SPAC presentation promises that have turned out to be empty or ""less than advertised"", who knows? In any case, if there's a downturn stuff like this is going to have zero support.

""OTLY ""

It's oat milk. And not likely going to be almond milk or pecan milk or something else because Oatly almond milk would be kinda weird given Oat in the name. What happens if the trendy non-milk milk becomes something other than Oats?

""ARVL -5 days

HYLN -5 days""

Making vehicles is not a great industry with very few exceptions. People think that because something is electric that that somehow changes things. It doesn't. So many of these EV cos that came public via SPACs with ridiculous 5 year projections are not going to be around in 5 years from now. This is a loooooong list and it's going to have some new additions in the coming years with some of these companies (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_defunct_automobile_manufacturers_of_the_United_States) - actually, Fisker is on there - that went bankrupt, then went public again last year via SPAC.

""A “big market delusion,” according to the paper, occurs when all the firms in an evolving industry rise together, despite that fact that they are competing against each other and only some can ultimately succeed. The trio cited airlines as a past example of an industry built around emerging technology, where “virtually every company in the business either failed or merged into a larger airline, most of which also collapsed.” (https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qx4f8709q5nf/Big-Market-Delusion-Rob-Arnott-Attacks-Tesla-Electric-Vehicle-Industry)  

People were buying EV anything last year in a ridiculous ""buy at any price"" mania and now you have companies that went public via the ridiculous EV SPAC fest that are frauds (Lordstown, Nikola) and things that are delivering 6 trucks in a quarter (Workhorse) and people still act like they're going to be something despite multiple instances of basically vaporware or things are are barely a company (WKHS delivering a whole 6 trucks in a quarter) or things that look like a glorified kickstarter project (FUV.) 

Even if there is a decent company to come out of the EV SPAC ridiculousness, the automobile industry is really difficult - people want ""The Next Tesla"", but I don't think they realize how rare that is in an industry like that and a large part of that was Musk the marketer. But even with Musk, how many times over the years has he said that Tesla was on the brink? So what makes people think that dozens of EV companies with no record, no ""Musk-like"" figure and in many cases no actual vehicles yet have a huge chance?

Buy good companies, not things like EV SPACs. If there was a downturn tomorrow, people with portfolios full of this kind of stuff are going to get obliterated.

I said earlier this year it would not surprise me if when growth stocks bounced people became somewhat more discriminating and perhaps the EV SPAC stuff getting left behind is an example of that.",dvdmovie1,25,/r/investing/comments/ocbxbj/what_is_happening_to_small_speculative_stocks/h3ti3r6/,0.066,0.871,0.063,0.5065

Big gains in their plug-in Hybrid and regular Hybrid vehicles. 

This looks good,  selling more high margin vehicles and increasing Hybrid sales means fleet average fuel economy  should be higher meaning they can save money on purchasing CAFE credits.

For someone looking for long term growth, say 10+ years. What do you feel would be the wisest purchase. I myself believe with purchasing about $6000 in VFV, the Vanguard S&P 500 Tracker ETF.

143,TDA," Depends how long you hold it. If it's at expiry and both legs are in the money, and you have the margin account, it is likely that you would be assigned for the 120c selling the 100 shares x 120 for +$12000 making you short 100 shares. Then they would likely exercise the 90c, which is usually automatic for ITM options given you have sufficient buying power, for -$9000 and closing your short shares.

This is the max profit for your trade of $3000.

/e

The truth is, you should manage your trades as your short options go ITM and expiry approaches. It should be fine because your long call can always cover the short call. Generally you would be able to close for nearly max profit early when both legs are ITM.

You won't necessary need the $9k in your account because the assignment will give you $12k and -100 shares position and they will exercise your option for $9k leaving you with $3k cash and no equity position.

They generally charge fees for assignment and exercise tho so manage your trades once you have a solid win, don't leave it up to TDA to decide.",GammaHz,1,/r/investing/comments/ocgn1d/pmcc_question_what_if_my_covered_calls_got_breach/h3u7qr7/,0.01,0.87,0.12,0.9587
