0,IR," I got some more fun names for you out of this company:  


1. Escrow agent on two deals in 2017, 2018 was *Sichenzia Ross Friedman Ference,* a law firm that represents frauds in court - Better Call Saul style.

2. John M. Fife, company president, is a convicted fraudster.

3. Andrew Barron Worden, who helped them with some other deals and owned a lot of shares 10 years ago, is also a convicted fraudster (wire fraud) who was recently pardoned by Trump.

4. CKR Law signed for them in an S-3 filing in 2015, law firm that... you guessed it... committed fraud.

5. Their IR was managed by one Dragon Gate Investment Partners, an IR firm that worked with some of the worst companies out of China like LongFin (another chinese fraud turned crypto fraud).

Many restaurants also inflate their prices on Uber Eats because I’ve heard Uber takes a 20-30% cut from the cost of the order too.

It gets to a point where customers will say no more to Uber. Nobody is willing to pay 50% more on an order just because Uber is going to deliver it.

In many cases, it’s cheaper to book a taxi to go to the place and pick up your order yourself than to have Uber do it.

Even the ride-hailing aspect is nonsense, it’s nearly always more cheaper to get a taxi from a private business than it is to get one from Uber.

38,EBAY," One thing I was looking for but not seeing in this analysis is discussion of the 2019 restructuring at the urging of hedge funds Elliott Management and Starboard Value who had taken a significant position in Ebay.

Then, in their 10-K filing for 2020, they attributed the 23% YOY increase in revenues to a boost in gross merchandise volume (GMV) as a result of the pandemic.   So in management-speak, they're not expecting this trend to continue as people get back to their normal lives.

FCF and EPS DCF valuations put EBAY between $30 and $40 a share while it's trading at $58 or a whopping 45% premium at best.   Even if those numbers are off by half, it signals two things:

1. EBAY is not trading at a discount.
2. There's significant downward pressure on 2021 market price given that senior management attributes almost all of 2020's earnings goodness to the pandemic.

So we really don't know that the restructuring helped Ebay because we can't hold that item in isolation from the pandemic effects and it would be a material, not trivial, stumble to pick it up at $58 a share thinking it's a discount only to find that 2021 repeats 2019's four straight quarters of earnings misses.",th3cr1t1c,7,/r/investing/comments/m72q6s/ebay_due_diligence_and_why_i_think_the_stock_is/gr98ewr/,0.06,0.804,0.136,0.9546

You then do zero explanations on how Ebay can possiby grow going forward after selling off multiple divisions or any explanation for why it's revenue can even remain not ""stagnant"" and stale unlike the previous years post covid

You only stated a bunch of financial ratios which mean nothing wihtout context.

44,DD," Great DD thank you! I’ve learned a lot with it and by reading the comments. I didn’t shop on eBay for over a year, and had no idea that they weren’t using PayPal anymore. I simply HATE using PayPal. As seller (pda accessories in Switzerland back in the days) they blocked 15% of my sales revenue for 90 days for years. Just a pain. As a little eBay seller, I never liked the back office feeling but happy with my sales and the smoothness for the transactions. As a buyer, I used them to get collector credit cards etc…. Do they provide a fulfillment services as well? I like Amazon fast 5min shipping but i hate to navigate in all the trash they sell.

46,AAPL," Interesting take.  

I've been buying off of eBay since 2000 so have a bit of background experience.  

eBay has often expanded into a variety of markets, this would include forays into Craigslist, Skype, PayPal, Magento, Enterprise Services and Services in countries such as India and China.  

It has divested itself from many of them, recognizing billions of profit at times, including the latest sale of the classifieds business in Europe (pending CMA approval) which includes Gumtree.

Though entry into certain markets was made early, capitalization often failed.  Either due to failure to understand the culture, or the technology stack being lacking.  

This, when there was little to no competition, wasn't a hindrance, and later on eBay could sell their business there to another.

That said:

* COVID was a godsend for eBay as more people purchased online.  But as businesses open up, expect online sales to decline.
* Many AMZN and EBAY business sellers cross-list, with fees being not only a driving factor, but where products are shipped from.  You can buy on eBay and receive a package from AMZN with a gift receipt.  And you can find the product cheaper on EBAY. 
* Curated goods, and goods that are validated as authentic is a big deal.  Whether you purchase a Rolex, Nike or Pokemon cards, you want to know that what you're buying is authentic.
* Sellers can get shafted, with buyer protection paramount on EBAY.  To counter, EBAY has helped reduce the fees / costs of doing business
* AMZN has fulfillment centers and though EBAY tried delivery twice, those things were shelved.  
* Payments 2.0 is proceeding and this is the aftermath of the PayPal separation resulting in savings for the sellers and no requirement to use PayPal, giving payments to other processors.  
* Management (internal) changes are occurring and this may also continue to make directional changes which allow eBay to invest in different areas of commerce.

Is it an investment opportunity?

* Long term outlook doesn't look rosy.  It's a solid business with solid cash flow, but the market continues to move.  What is EBAY 2.0 or the next generation going to offer?
* I don't think so when we compare it to other options.  An example would be a comparison in buying AMZN, VTI or AAPL.  Would the stock growth be greater, or the dividend payout higher?
* If you're looking for a low risk play, that pays out and has growth ... maybe this is for you.  But compare to VTI ($200 vs $55 /share) or other investments ... $55 hasn't really moved but VTI has over the past year.

Ebay is an archaic and ugly mess that far overcharges for the service it provides. It is only able to do this because of brand recognition and habitual user habits.

60,FB," Interesting perspective. (I'm a casual seller) I used to think this too, but not so much now. 2 reasons:

\- Young people leaving FB. The last $3k of sales I've had have had much more engagement on eBay (having it on FB marketplace simultaneously). Young people spend money more easily than the older demographic that is coming to define FB in the US. If there was an IG marketplace, different story.

\- Selling on FB Marketplace is a terrible experience. It wouldn't let me list a bike frame outside my local area and gave me no reason why I couldn't offer shipping. The listing got no exposure past me just putting an eBay link on my IG story. When I viewed the listing on certain devices it said it was in the skateboards category, but on my listing editor it said bicycles. Surely, these were bugs but I expect more from a company that attracts the best software developer talent in the world. Move fast and break things I guess.

eBay *does* need to revise its fee structure. Yesterday. I think the real threat is from Amazon though. 82% of US households have Prime. Amazon could add a few buttons in their app and website to steer casual sellers like me to listing items on it and boom, eBay is dead.

67,DCF," To answer your DCF question, yes.  The problem is that these numbers aren't even close to a discount.  They're a steep premium... and in our analyses we should be more conservative, not less, than management and their self-serving interests.

When touting securities as undervalued, we value investors are looking for the exact opposite... I want companies that are, without a doubt, trading at 20-50% below fair value, without any serious gotchas in their operating history, to insulate me from catastrophe should my analysis be off even by a wide margin.

I used to work in FP&A and what concerns me here is that there's no examination of why the consistent earnings misses in 2019—some of which may or may not be tied to the dead weight of Classifieds and StubHub.  You would find some answers, or at least some handwaving through which you could decode the real answers, in the variance commentary of quarterly earnings calls.

At any rate, as soon as I saw that this was priced at a premium, I would have stopped right there without further analysis.  There are so many other companies to analyze that it's not worth our time or money to try to turn the money box on its back, side, etc. to see if I can flip a 45% premium to a 50% discount.   You're unlikely to find that much goodness hiding somewhere without distorting reality beyond the limits of reasonability.

EDIT: And the more time you spend trying to bleed goodness out of a turkey, the more great companies fleetingly mispriced that you're going to overlook elsewhere in the market.  The goal in value investing is to find great companies that are mispriced now, rather than mediocre companies that are overpriced, or even fairly priced, with only the *hope* that they will become great companies.",th3cr1t1c,5,/r/investing/comments/m72q6s/ebay_due_diligence_and_why_i_think_the_stock_is/gr9atfq/,0.07,0.803,0.127,0.9521
68,UI," I think the point on collectibles is an unfair assessment. Of course there will be some people that list outrageously above market value, but some things are just incredibly expensive right now due to high consumer demand. And people are willing to pay for it. Look at Pokémon Games, Warhammer 40K bits, MtG Booster Boxes, etc. That shit is selling HOT right now, at prices that are in some cases 2x what they were 3-6mo ago. 

Auction websites aren’t as good as EBay when it comes to mass market sales, neither is Reddit. EBay is raking in the dough right now and as long as strong brands stay strong which allows collectible prices to keep climbing, buyers and sellers will stay on-platform, and the business will continue to prosper. Amazon doesn’t come close to competing when it comes to secondhand listings, and people in this thread severely overestimate the value of overnight delivery to collectors and auction buyers.

The only limit with swappa is there are only certain categories of personal electronics, phones and gaming stuff you can list.

Inflation aside, though, it's pretty obvious that policy during the pandemic has driven an asset price bubble in just about everything: housing, stocks, bonds, and precious metals.  Gold and bonds have started to fall.  Do stocks and house prices follow them or not?  To put it another way, if you think inflation risk is overhyped, is cash actually a good place to be right now?

100,GDP," There is a non-zero chance that I am a dodo brain, but so far you are making no sense to me. I have tried to address some of your points.

1) Do not, ever, compare the Japanese pension, insurance and asset management funds to the American ones. Its makes no sense. Like just fucking google it.

Now, I should clarify, that when I say JAPANESE INSTITUTIONS, obviously I mean the major Japanese orgs that are buying USTs. That includes the ludicrously large pension and insurance funds, AND the Bank of Japan. That same BOJ, that is the LARGEST holder in the Japanese stock market, and has a balance sheet so freaking large that has no choice but to buy outside government bonds to not crowd out the domestic market, and to maintain any hope of avoiding -ve rates in JP, let alone their own dream of 2% main lending rate. 

Again, google the awesome size of the BOJ, and just be dumbstruck at how it compares to Japanese GDP, stock market cap, etc.

And on the question of Japanese buyers affect the treasury market, the yields literally went up in the last days of feb/early days of march, when the Japanese buyers temporarily withdrew from the market, because of local annual financial closings/disclosures. This happens every year.

And as they came back into the markets, the yields went back down (this was the 1.6 level, from which the 10y retreated back in early march). Again, just google this shit, and see what the common consensus in the major financial dailies was about this.

So, to conclude, it is LAUGHABLE for you to say that Japanese UST buyers ""cannot compete with the banking system in affecting the market"". Like, they are the biggest foreign holders, AND continue to buy more. Additionally, with the Chinese continuing their habit of the last year or so, of decreasing the pace of purchases of USTs, and RAPIDLY increasing their purchases of JGBs and to a lesser extent, various European government bonds; Japanese buyers will continue to exert substantial pressure on the $ treasury market. Especially the belly and the long end of the curve. Again, google the chinese UST buying behavior in recent years to learn more about what I wrote.

""If there were a lack of treasuries, bond prices would just go up.""

You cannot put out a blanket statement about the treasury market like this. Just recently for instance, while the most recent 7y issue went badly (big tail), the 20 and 10 y ones that happened in the following days went relatively fine (the 20y was a borderline case tbh).

At the same time, while the long end of the curve might be facing demand concerns (and I stress ""might be"" because as the yields go up ever so slightly, they start to become more and more juicy Intl buyers); the short end of the curve is losing its mind over lack of sufficient treasuries. As I wrote earlier, in the repo market, the overnight for the 2y went to -ve .4. So demand is certainly robust in the 5y and lower bills, and as the yields go up in the belly and long end, they will also start to become irresistible.

""The inflation narrative is literally upside down; QE, Stimulus, old credit is all deflationary. The system needs banks to keep making loans to keep it alive, and look at the velocity of money. Shit is going to hit the fan in the next two years.""

Again, extremely misleading to say the least. There is a honest concern that the real problem infront of the Fed is Deflation and over-hot inflation. BUT, there has been nothing to suggest that we are fast moving towards deflation anytime soon. Have you seen data that suggests otherwise?

""The system needs banks to keep making loans to keep it alive, and look at the velocity of money. Shit is going to hit the fan in the next two years.""

104,GDP," Because as US treasury rates rise, international and domestic institutional investors will begin to purchasing US bonds at larger proportions than they otherwise are given the relative attractiveness of the higher US treasury yield versus say German or Japanese treasuries. When demand for bonds goes up, bond prices go up and yields come down. 

Some institutions like pension funds or insurance companies are pretty much forced to purchase large quantities of low risk (due to high capital charges on risk) and long duration (due to the need to match liabilities with assets) assets.

Plus idk...I’ve always thought that yields and inflation are supposed to occur when an economy is coming out of the crapper so I don’t understand the panic. In one sense, I get the velocity of rate increases were pretty sharp but on the other hand the pandemic is kind of a light switch scenario. The economy was turned “off” in last March with immediate lockdowns of most of any consumer based economic activity and we saw the enormous drop in GDP in Q2, this time the economy is being “turned on” in which people tomorrow (not literally but you get the idea) can go out and do whatever they want. Plus with most people really not having spent as much money as they otherwise would, there should be a rise in short term inflation expectations. Though I doubt it’ll persist since the younger generation has to save like crazy to have any chance at an “ok” retirement since wage growth is non existent.

128,AI," So, I thought about creating a business optimizing fertilizer for gardens and sat down and read a few 800 page text books on gardening, plant nutrition, and soil science.

Scotts and pretty much all fetilizer you get at the store are maybe one of the biggest junk science things you can buy.

Not that they dont necessarily work to some extent - they do, but there is zero differentiation between rhe bags you can buy at Home Depot.

Plants need a lot of different nutrients, from Potassium, Nitrogen, to Molybdenum and the conversion of these elements into different compounds in different soil is insanely complex. 

Scientists have really only figured out the optimal, usually in the max uptake amount of a particular nutrient per soil volume for a few plant type, nutrient combinations - staple crops (corn, wheat, rice, soy, etc) and the big 6: N, S, P, Ph, K, Ca

Almost any fertilzer will have around the same distribution of those in urea (N), ammonia (N), Phosphate, Potash, Sulfur, and Calcium (lime), abd trace amounts of some other minerals.

Every single brand is the same thing. I've looked at the bags at home depot, they are all about the same
 The only thing that changes is the soil quality or the delivery method (water soluble, slow release 'pills', etc).

Nobody in the world can tell you how much nickel a watermelon needs to grow optimally (however you want to define it), partly because each patch of earth is different.

The prevailing method of fertilizer is basically this: give more than enough to plant, so that growth isn't limited by a shortage of something like NO3, and let the plant regulate uptake itself. Just don't put too much on to avoid spending too much money and don't make the soil toxic. Its like running a buffet, plants will regulate how much they eat.

99.9% of customers probably never look nor understand the technical label and don't know what they are buying. 

So, investing in Scotts is not about investing in a superior 'product' or innovation. Its about investing in a developed sales channel, branding, cost efficiencies in its supply chain, etc. That also means it has a decent moat, since there isn't a lot of 'easy' innovation to be had. I could sell a mixture of urea, lime, potash, phosphate, and some other minerals mixed with composted minerals without doing any research and it would get you 95% of the state of the art. But no investor would give me the large amount of money needed to reach the scale and efficiency of a Scott's, when Scott's always exists and there is significant operational risk on the downside. 

The future innovation, using advanced data science/AI (my background and what I was looking into), to finely tune nutrient needs is just way too hard to be worth it, other than huge monoculture farms. Nobody soon is going to optimize a nutrient mix for your backyard lime bush.",bcuap10,1,/r/investing/comments/m6joep/long_thesis_scotts_miracle_gro_smg_1720_upside/gra22jn/,0.024,0.854,0.122,0.9934

They own 53,3% of all VW main shares (the shares you can buy in the US) with Voting rights.
their shares are worth over 50bio €, meanwhile Porsche SE is valued at 25bio €

You get the same amount of shares for half the price basically ...

Porsche SE is a Holding Company. 50% of Porsche SE shares have a Voting right and are in hands of the Porsche/ Piëch Family. The other 50% have no voting rights and they are the ones you can buy. Around 2/3 of VW shares have a voting right, but are still very illiquid, because a German State NRW owns 20% and Qatar 20%, meaning there is only 10% for the rest of the marked. In Europe we can easily buy the VW vz. stocks, which have no voting right but get a little bit more dividend. However, in the US you can’t buy VW directly. As a result you can only buy the VW shares with voting rights indirectly and since so many people in the US are doing this right now and the marked for VW St stocks (with voting right) is so illiquid the marked goes up like crazy right now. 
The VW Vz also goes up, but not as crazy as the VW St. stocks.

Greetings from Germany 

Btw. The real VW St. stock you are indirectly buying costs 350€ right now :) and the VW Vz. cost 328€ and you get higher dividends.

Demand is definitely going to increase but so will supply. The US will ""drill baby drill"" as long as oil is over $60/bbl imo.


If you're talking major oil companies VS the commodity, chevron has had a hell of a year back up to very high levels but exxon is much further behind due to over investment at tops and poor management through troughs.


Considering there isn't any company or commodity that hasn't skyrocketed in the last year, this all seems par for the course with the current market. 


I like chevrons management and ""fortress balance sheet.""

I’m 24, have ~100k in savings, and ~3k monthly disposable income.

No debt, no assets, not even a proper citizenship - I’m from a country where human rights are a fairytale, and live in a place where I have little chances to naturalise.

I want to grow my savings as much as possible though I have relatively low risk tolerance. I might need to use this money in, say, 3-5 years for a house (best case), or as a rescue fund at any time if something goes wrong with my job or immigration situation (worst case).

As for the disposable component, I’m more comfortable with riskier options.

I have very little financial knowledge, and just a little bit of exposure to the markets as a long time lurker.

Now my worry is that most of the good companies I’ve kept an eye on have grown to be overpriced, and even a no-brainer SPY looks like it’s about to start bleeding, all things considered. For example, I had TSLA on my watchlist since it was under $200 pre-split, and I didn’t buy.

Another problem is that I’m afraid of inflation. They printed so much money in the states, and the market is pumped, so this whole situation will just eat away my cash if I don’t do anything.

I think getting into stable dividend stocks with the savings, and DCA into a growth index or two with occasional risky purchases with the income would be a good play.

I was actually going for the [Lyxor](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=FR0011550672#overview) because it has lower TER. But this got me thining. Was the 2018 some accident or the actively stepped in and do it for some funds and not for others?

I sell a cash-covered put on XYZ company. 

The Strike Price is $10 and the Premium is $1.00. So I pocket $100, and I now have $1000 tied up as collateral. 

Let's say the real price falls to $9.50 --> .50 below the strike price. 

Exercising at this point would give the Buyer $1000 *minus* the $100 premium they already paid, earning them a total credit of $900. ~~So, it wouldn't make any sense for them to exercise just because it went~~  

It would make perfect sense because I'm forgetting about the premium. If they sold at market for $950, they're really just getting $850.

223,AMD," I tend to disagree with your assessment of Intel. Yes, Intel has had a bad two years, and yes there has been leadership changes. However, when we talk about moat, the fact *despite* a rough two years intel has not lost much of its value. It has superior financial strength, more cash than they know what to do with, and profit margins AMD and NVidia can only dream of right now. AMD and NVidia are in growth mode right now, its easy to see their stocks skyrocketing, but they don't have market cap anywhere close to Intel. You could see when people rotated out of tech stocks AMD and NVidia saw a stark decline, while Intel relatively stayed the same. This is the ""margin of safety"" concept buffet and other value investors talk about. Intel has the lowest PE ratio out of the big chipmakers, and actually has consistently paid good dividends for over a decade. AMD does not have the financial stability to pay a dividend, they need to keep putting cash in the business to grow because if they don't hit growth numbers they have a lot of value at risk. They are creating shareholder value by growing, which is risky if you all of the sudden cant grow anymore, your PE ratio will come back to more stable valuations. Intel creates shareholder value with less growth, but providing safe dividends. 

Sure Intel is not a growth play, but it has plenty of moat. It has lost ground in intangible brand name asset to competitors, but on every other ground it's dividends and value are not at risk like its high growth competitors with how healthy its balance sheet is and how undervalued it is compared to all other chipmakers.",grizlovesvalue,3,/r/investing/comments/m6wb43/economic_moatcompetitive_advantage/gr89gje/,0.061,0.708,0.231,0.9949
224,TSM," I think the difference is you’re looking at this from the perspective of dividends and stock prices and finances. I’m more looking at it in terms of strategic advantages Intel has over competitors. 

If you go back for the last two to three decades Intel’s fabs were world class; there is no argument that they’ve ceded the lead on that moat to TSM (whether they can catch up is debatable - personally I think that ship has sailed). 

I do agree they have a strong brand name with the consumer. However, even that is cracking as you see the hyperscale cloud providers move away to their own ARM-based servers. The numbers are small now but it is a frightening development. 

Intel certainly has some moats, they have great x86 architecture and still put out great chipsets; I just wanted to weigh in on OPs view. Rooting for the stock and company. Bad for the global consumer if Samsung and TSM own state of the art semi manufacturing.",Investing8675309,3,/r/investing/comments/m6wb43/economic_moatcompetitive_advantage/gr8bjkz/,0.068,0.822,0.11,0.8248
