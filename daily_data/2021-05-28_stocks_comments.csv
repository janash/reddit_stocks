54,AMC," Hedge funds shorted the stock thinking it was going to succumb to the covid outbreak and bet it was going to go bankrupt, just like they did with companies like Toys R Us. Then a few smart folks out there noticed and spread the numbers all across media outlets. This led to a glorious community of supporters of the company that dug deeper into the technicals of what was going on and found out that some hedge funds were pumping synthetic shares (naked shorts; borrowment of a shares that get sold multiple times) into market place trying to drive the price down even further. The community rallied, bought shares and options contracts for the last 5 months and have so far made it possible for AMC to keep afloat through 2022. Their largest shareholder slowly eased out of their holdings and the community bought them all up.

To this day, the shorts have not covered their shorts (or naked shorts). In fact, they continue to short the stock. Since the stock holders own around 80% of the available common stock and likely most if not all of the synthetics, the owners are waiting for the hedge funds to cover their shorts and to buy back the synthetic shares. Multiple. Times. 

AMC is also going to do a share recall at the beginning of June to see who owns what and how many shares are actually in circulation. There should only be 493 Million. Those hedge funds who have not covered their positions are heavily leveraged and under water. It is anticipated that their financiers are going to demand they have the money in cash to balance their books. This is called a margin call. The community is in the strong belief that they cannot do this. If they cannot, their positions will be forced to liquidate, thus bankrupting the hedge fund.

Hedge funds have been doing shenanigans like this since the 1920's, resulting in one of the worse economic unravelings in the world. The internal governing body, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been writing and passing new laws and votes to curtail this behavior after the GameStop price skyrocketed. 

What is going on right now with AMC is a combination of big money manipulating the market and the retail investor going head to head. Sentiment is very high, a new factor to consider that cannot be charted.

57,AMC," AMC is going through what people on the other subreddit will call a squeeze of start of squeeze or whatever.
Apparently there is a vote on June 2 and the CEO said they will count and make public exactly what is the float before the vote is conducted.
The expectation is the short percentage is a lot higher than reported as it is hard to correctly count shorts.
Hence people started buying which meant shorts have to cover which means they have to buy more and the cycle continues
Until it doesn't. All short squeezes as the name suggests are a squeeze and prices fall as fast as they rise if not faster.

Just look at Archegos. No one know that VIAC was being pumped by a 10:1 leveraged family fund. As soon as they were margin called, VIAC collapsed 50% of its value in 2 days. If people had known that a 10% move in VIAC would have caused a bankrupting margin call on Archegos, I don't think there would have been as many people investing in VIAC. And odds are, VIAC wouldn't have done a share offering at 10% below its price  which triggered the whole event.

102,RKT," > But still there is a whole country

That's trading on speculation. And you think ""ooh a huge country"", but it's just one country, and it's russia. If they can't even get a broker to buy from nyse i wouldn't trust their ability to move a stock and **keep** it there. 

I bought RKT back in the day and sold same day, buy you gotta be sober and know when you're riding a PnD wave and jump off soon enough to not be exactly the kind of person they are trying to profit off of.

Such intra day flipping while betting on bad stuff happening is way different from actual investing. Still haven't heard any spaceships bringing any rich people to space, and when I do the stock will probably already have been priced to perfection for the longest time. Not really worth it. Daytrading but not based on any news sounds like a bad time.

187,MO," Also keep in mind a few of the recent news items. MO dropped a month or so back on news that Biden wants to legislate lower nicotine content. Obviously that hasn’t passed or even been introduced yet but if it does pass could effect them. It’s why MO went from $52 to $47, although it’s been recovering nicely. 

Second, while I agree on the weed play, keep in mind it’s under anti-trust review from the FTC because of the large interest it acquired in JUUL (the weed play). I assume if they lose they will have to divest themselves of JUUL and we lose our covert weed play to some degree, though I still think MO will get involved after federal legalization. 

In short, if you are okay with those risks, then it’s a good buy in price now and has potential later with weed legalization, but those are some decent sized risks.

I just went through this. Log on to your account and search for ""withdraw excess contribution."" With TDA, there is a form to print out, sign, then upload to message center. With Fidelity it's an online form. On the form there will be an option to tick to let the broker calculate the gains for you. Also there will be an option for the broker to sell shares of your choosing in case you don't have cash in the account. I think you can avoid the 6% if you get it out before filing taxes for the contribution year.

256,IRS," There are special rules just for them. They have to maintain a $25K ""excess margin balance,"" meaning every night when margin is rectified they have to have at least $25k cash or they get a margin call in the morning. It's impossible to have both cash and debt, so that excess means any overnight holdings are fully paid for. 

They can trade their excess margin balance from the night before with a 25% margin requirement, meaning they can buy stock worth 4X the cash they have. They can buy and sell that as many times as they want during the day.

They also have the option to use a special tax reporting method where they report their account value at the beginning and end of the year and add or deduct the difference as ordinary income. No wash sale rule, no $3k deduction limit, no detailed listings of basis and proceeds (unless they're audited and have to prove they really are a day trader as their job and not an ordinary investor; there's no clear IRS rule defining that, so having proof of entering and exiting significant positions nearly every trading day of the year is about all that works).

The margin rules keep (most) n00bs from getting in so deep they can never get out. For experienced traders and innately stable instruments (treasuries, mortgage securities, etc), they're relaxed quite a bit. For penny stocks and volatile companies, they're made super-tight.",merlinsbeers,2,/r/stocks/comments/nmolbj/is_there_a_waiting_period_between_selling_shares/gzr5bur/,0.044,0.865,0.09,0.8658

330,VIACP," Looking at the maths.    
3 payments this year. 4 each in 2022 and 2023. One in 2024.    
So there's 12 dividend payments.     
If we assume 1.55 each time that's payment of 18.60 dollars.    
Now the standard stock will probably pay 0.25 dollars per quarter or or 3 over the same time period.
The difference is 15.6 dollars.    
Note you pay witholding or income tax on that too so you don't even profit by that much unless it's in a Roth IRA.    
After this the stock reverts to let's say 1.10 shares.    
Current share value of 42.5 would be approx 47 dollars of shares.

349,NVDA," I really don't think NVDA is overvalued. Its forward P/E is 40 - lower than AMZN's (45), not much higher than MSFT's (30), etc. It isn't like they have some kind of crazy 100+ forward P/E evaluation. Plus their forward P/E is justified from their insane growth, which has been happening even despite the chip shortage. There is a high demand for their current products that will only grow and they are getting into CPUs now. And even more forward looking, they are the overwhelming leader in AI with CUDA so I just don't see their growth slowing any time soon. IMO, their valuation is more than fair given their future growth trajectory.",BubbyginkESO,4,/r/stocks/comments/nn2ox3/nvda_valuation_hold_or_sell/gzsu402/,0.09,0.79,0.119,0.5596
