1,ALL," I'm not going to dispute the valuations as I'm not particularly experienced in the market.

But from a developer standpoint I have a few disagreements with your DD. Firstly calling Cloudflare a leading player while not totally inaccurate is still very debatable as they have very high competition in the field from companies that entered serverless earlier than them, namely Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft all of which released a version ahead of Cloudflare.

Secondly, the open source fork of React which is mentioned in the article has been public for around a year with not much interest surrounding it from developers with weekly downloads around 434. While the solution it self seems great on the outside it presents quite a few issues  if the developer or company decides they no longer want to use Cloudflare yanking this from the project would I imagine cause quite a few headaches.

Finally assuming that developers will create ALL full-stack applications solely in Flareact, React, Angular or one of the other many similar solutions is as of now still not a widely used approach.

6,IMO," I've been long on NET since it's IPO and have been a customer of cloudflare for many years before this. 

I'm long for two reasons.   
\#1 - They have the best technology. They focus on low-level network technology like DNS and for years they have had the best technology, best performance and IMO the best price for the value. This makes it a no-brainer for most high-traffic websites.  It's easy to sell the best product and their sales are growing accordingly. 

\#2 - They are constantly innovating.  They keep pushing the state of the art and performance across a number of areas.  CDN, DNS, Smart Routing, Analytics, etc. These products work really well together and they scale with the speed of the Internet. Most people don't know about Cloudflare or their tech so I think they have a ton of room for growth and market expansion. 

Compare NET with older network companies like Cisco, Oracle, EMC, and others.  There's a ton of room for growth and many older companies that don't have the best technology and aren't quick to innovate.

55,NET," I own no position in NET but I use them at work and for multiple side projects.

The products are also nested do deep that if you use the basic features (cache, ssl, some page rules - free features) you may not even know the awesome paid ones exist.

I think their terrible layout actively hurts them and without CRMs they aren't realizing as much revenue as they could. Having someone to help you onboard, explain products, and up sell seems like it'll help them a lot.

57,NET," I don’t. I’m a potential customer and their offering is different than MBD. With MBD I can easily buy it and test it and decide for myself in a closed environment. For the big ticket NET items I need to involve network engineers who have tons of questions, the cost of a mistake can be high, and if we don’t understand something we may just give up having not seen the value. A true POC is just as much an investment from my team as it for NET. They need to be “selling” the whole time. Then for all that effort, they want a term commitment, which is big deal for me too.

So, yes, they need a good sales team.

Me, I’m still not sold - I have Imperva for WAF and used Route53 and Quad9 for DNS.

I've watched this unfold over the last 5 years at my friends tech company where he was something like employee #5. They've always had a quality product, but for the first few years it was only serving niche industries. Once they worked out the product kinks, they raised a new round of funding and they got an army of sales people and the company started growing exponentially. It wasn't until after that happened that the founders started buying their first lambos and houses (with bookshelves!) and that's not a meme to them. Additionally, when Solarwinds had their scandal, that same friend mentioned his experience dealing with them. He said they are super aggressive about sales and renewals, but he didn't even like their product. But we theorized it doesn't really matter if the product isn't the best as long as you have the best sales team, as evidenced by their huge market penetration and the security concerns that followed.

84,NET," I think there's another detail that makes your argument even stronger: NET/Cloudflare is a *better* company now than it was last week in the eyes of an intelligent investor. Their earnings were phenomenal, beating analysts' expectations, despite those expectations already being - understandably due to its enormous valuation - extremely high. Anytime a company beats even the most optimistic earnings for a quarter, you should be more confident than you were the day before, week before, etc. because that is a new, *highly* important piece of information. It validates your investment thesis, your expectations for their future growth, your confidence in the company, etc. just a little bit more every single time they post killer earnings. 

Last week, just like the week before basically every earnings report from NET, we weren't *certain* that they'd absolutely kill it. There's always uncertainty, and that uncertainty should be priced in. I'm not claiming that NET should've gone up from the earnings or that the market was wrong or anything like that - but I am arguing that *not only* is NET a great buy right now because, as you said, it's dipped slightly ($5-10), but that even if it had not dipped at all, anyone who was willing to buy at $95 last week should be willing to buy at $95-100 this week, because the only thing that's changed is *good news*/*results* coming out. 

So to everyone who is attacking you for calling this a dip: understand that this is all within the context of the killer earnings report coming out. A 5-10% decline *is* a substantial dip when there is zero reason for it to have occurred and in fact a clear reason it should not have in the eyes of a long-term investor.",stox_politix,5,/r/stocks/comments/lj1uip/dd_cloudflare_net_is_going_to_continue_its_strong/gn9y62a/,0.093,0.814,0.093,-0.6064

99,AMZN," So, to respond to your points:

- Historically, evaluations have always mattered. Every company that has been around long enough has eventually experienced a mean reversion to the multiples in its sector (PEG, price to earnings adjusted for growth, is what I tend to look at for in growth stocks, however this company has never been profitable so I will use P/S, price to sales, instead). NET’s largest competitors are AMZN and MSFT, with P/S ratios of 4.33 and 12.23, respectively. Net currently has a P/S ratio of 59.86. MSFT is more focused on software and cloud computing, so they are likely a better comparison in the case. NET still trades 5x higher than MSFT by this metric, and MSFT is currently trading significantly above their average P/S ratio of about 6 over the last 10 years. You are paying a big premium for NET compared to its biggest competitors.

- I don’t see how NET is innovating more than its competitors. MSFT and AMZN both have far more infrastructure for their CDNs, comparable DDoS protection services, network gateways, DNS, more authentication services, superior serverless computing, and fully functional/integrated webpage deployment (whereas Cloudflare barely launched its beta for Pages in Dec 2020, the beginning of their comparable service for this). It seems that Cloudflare is behind its top competitors in all of its primary products, and by quite a large margin. I have also worked with all three of these companies and their products in recent years, and can say that NET also felt like a distant third in this way.

- Building off my two previous points, how can you be sure that NET will be one of the companies making money? They offer inferior products and services compared to their competitors, and are trading 5-10x more expensively (or perhaps more considering how you weigh profitability). 

If you’re looking for exposure in this sector, NET seems like one of the worst investments in terms of risk-reward. All the reward seems to be priced in, while the risk of losing out on market share to its competitors does not seems to be. I don’t see how it overcomes its competition which have far more talent, infrastructure and resources to succeed in this sector, and even in its best case it will take over 10 years to catch up to its valuation if it maintains its current rate of growth.

129,NET," Not really. Personally I'd wait till it drops closer to its 50 EMA because it's reached that before fairly recently. But there's no guarantee it'll drop that low, it can easily bounce off this 21 EMA like a lot of stocks do. Suddenly the 21 EMA is a solid entry point. Or maybe it doesn't. There's no analysis you can do to predict the future. All you can do is put yourself in the best position when you enter so that you can minimise the risks.

You want to buy at the support ideally (which lies around the 50 day EMA for NET) but buying at the average price is a good entry if it's a mid-long position. All you're trying to do is use the price history to reference where an ideal entry point would be. And there are trends/patterns you can identify to help determine when it is likely to break out. That doesn't mean that is guaranteed to happen; like I said, you can't predict the future. But you can put yourself in a position to get the best odds in succeeding. And a solid entry point is an important foundation of that.

To be clear I'm not talking about NET specifically. I don't have an opinion on the stock, I don't own it. I was just responding to the question that was asking how to recognise what's a dip and what's a high price. And price point analysis is the perfect way to do that.

130,AAPL,"   OK - my previous comment was a bit mean, but it's true in the sense that over time the stock market rewards those who are 1) consistent and 2) patient.

If you wish to grow your money with reduced risk, there is absolutely nothing wrong with a nicely well set portfolio and adding to it over time on a **consistent** basis. This requires you to do 0 analysis, 0 time dedicated towards studying stocks, analysts, etc. etc. It's all just noise.

Here's an example in action - *Bear in mind the S&P500 peaked in November 2007 and didn't return to that level until April 2013.*

Say in 2007 you had $10,000 and you finally decided to plunk it into the stock market.. tired of seeing everyone else make money. We know what happens over the next 5 years, so let's take a look.

&#x200B;

1. You invest all $10K split      equally in the S&P500 ETF ($SPY - 50%) and Nasdaq ($QQQ - 50%) on Jan      1st 2007, rebalancing annually and re-invest dividends **but not      contributing anything ever again**. [https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2007&firstMonth=1&endYear=2013&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=SPY&allocation1\_1=50&symbol2=QQQ&allocation2\_1=50](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2007&firstMonth=1&endYear=2013&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=SPY&allocation1_1=50&symbol2=QQQ&allocation2_1=50)   
So what happened? By October 2007, you had reached almost a 20% return!!      Yay!! Celebration time! Then as you see, you went on to lose 40% of your      initial capital. Regardless, if you just hung on, you will have returned      to your $10K just as 2011 was coming around. That's a tough 3 years and your      confidence is shot - the news is fixated on Greece debt collapsing, then      Italy, then Spain, then the whole Eurozone! Oh no better sell, right?      Well, no. If you just hung on.. by end of 2013 when the S&P500 is back      to where it was when you started and your $10K is now nearly $15K. **And      you did absolutely nothing but hold on.**
2. Now imagine you decided to      put $1,000 to start, and contribute the remaining $9000 in blocks - $1,500      at the start of every new year. Same allocation as above: [https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2007&firstMonth=1&endYear=2013&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=1000&annualOperation=1&annualAdjustment=1500&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=SPY&allocation1\_1=50&symbol2=QQQ&allocation2\_1=50](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2007&firstMonth=1&endYear=2013&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=1000&annualOperation=1&annualAdjustment=1500&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=SPY&allocation1_1=50&symbol2=QQQ&allocation2_1=50)  
So what happened? By October 2007, you were up a measly $1,192 which is      still almost 20% but only of $1K.. and you have $9K sitting around doing      nothing. But then you stay on schedule and deposit $1,500 every year.. even      when the news is telling you the world is collapsing and you end up with      $20K at the end of 2013 - a total 200% return on your $10K or an insane      50% cumulative annual growth rate.

Now, you can either focus taking the lazy investing route and spend your energy on maximizing how much you put in (i.e. your day job/savings). Or you can take the more challenging/rewarding route of spending time fine tuning which stocks you put it into. If you replace the above SPY/QQQ with AAPL/GOOG you would have and even more impressive return..

But neither Apple or Google were sure things back then, although they were revolutionary.

219,BB," You mean people might not shop at a store based on the stock price, because the stock price reflects the quality of the goods or general negative sentiment hurts them? That seem like a pretty unliky premise to me, but let's explore with examples. 

Especially for most places where this has been brought up as an example. I mean, would people not buy FIFA 2021 from gamestop because people say the company is going out of business? Thats a pretty thin premise for Gamestop struggling to survive. People didn't stop shopping there because they had a general bad impression. They stopped because people buy games online now. 

How about blackberry? If the premise is shorting hurts because of general negative feelings... they still call their company blackberry, whose connotation is that of a company struggling to adapt. 

Both companies could pivot, sure. But the premise that general negative setiment... I mean BB didn't change their name from Blackberry, which is synonymous with failure to adapt at this point. They can't think sentiment is worth much. 

Where people blame shorts, they either can't say how it matters or they say that short selling made it harder for a struggling company to get financing... well I would suggest that most of these companies, issuing stock would only elongate the death to the detriment of the new investors buying the new issuance anyway. 

This isn't me personal vendetta against these companies. Prepandemic I think I was 20% of my local Gamestops revenues I shopped there so much. I also recognize that the used video game market is fickle (and they messed up destroying cases and manuals and stuff), the collectibles market is small, and the new video game market will be nearly all online.

You could build a CD ladder and make tons that was 100% safe. Now that isn't possible. The strategy of having a cash emergency fund still applies. 6 months worth ? That is up to you. But investing is one of the keys to wealth. I do like the S&P long term. SPY is good. Along with a mixture of individual stocks. But I did join here because I do want to see what you all are up to. I am taking 10% to 20% of my cash and riding the wave. My first was SNDL that i plan to hold because I saw the manipulation by the big guys. Not Just robinhood and others but big guys like Merrill Lynch were crashing sites during the 79% up day. They do not want the little guy or retail investors to make money. Chamath is a billionaire who is ripping the media apart. The media is in bed with the billionaire hedge funds and he isn't. Which i admire. I also like Jordan Belfort. Yes he ripped off tons of people but I think he is a new man. We need the advise of these guys because we are up against a corrupt system.

If you are into esports any, maybe look at the NERD ETF. It was only started in 2019, but I personally feel that esports is only going to get bigger. That’s the only DD I have done on the ticker. 

I’d advise you to look further into it if you are interested, I am just a random dude. Lol.

316,HUGE," ARKK is great because its focus is on innovative “disruptive” companies in all sectors.

ARKF is focused more on the finance sector but still have some overlap with K


ARKQ is focused on robotics & autonomous tech, which is HUGE now and only going to grow, and overlap some with ARKK 


These 2 are also still a good deal with ARKF in the 60s and ARKQ still just below 100.
The others have already had a nice pop

Also I would sign up for daily trading notifications so you can see what companies they are buying and selling for each fund

322,IMO," We are still in the bull market started in the early 80s when Reagan came, rates started dropping, and 401ks began accumulating en masse. It's been 40 years now with a few minor setbacks in the way.

Bull markets don't need to end in a crash. 10-20 years of flat returns or a slow downtrend are more likely IMO. My concern is what happens now that 401k plans have net outflows due to baby boomers retiring. 

I think the party has a few years left of life in it, and I'm heavily weighted towards ex-US stocks and a few sector bets.",cr0ne,2,/r/stocks/comments/liorkj/if_everybodys_a_genius_in_a_bull_market_and_bull/gn9c3dy/,0.027,0.945,0.027,0.0

324,ONE," See, that's a stupid mindset. Sure, if you make a ONE time deposit into the market and NEVER added any additional funds throughout that 10 years.

353,XOM," The price of oil going up is a result of supply being restricted, predominately by OPEC, but also because many wells in the U.S. are not financially viable at lower oil prices. While oil companies like XOM stand to benefit from these higher prices through production in the short term, they are hurt by higher oil prices in the long term. As you stated, we will not dramatically transition away from oil completely for many years, but we are transitioning at the moment, and higher oil prices only accelerate that transition. XOM's price has been falling over the past five years as investors price in the transition away from oil. Despite this momentary uptick due to higher oil prices, I expect the stock prices of oil companies to decrease over the next few years as more oil production comes back online (increasing supply), and the world continues its transition away from fossil fuels (decreasing demand).",BellaBites,7,/r/stocks/comments/lj1kth/lets_talk_about_very_long_oil_plays/gn8bxzk/,0.067,0.875,0.058,-0.09

For paid advertisers, Pinterest is where Instagram was five years ago and Facebook was 10 years ago – a total fucking gold rush. If your audience is on there, it's absolutely one of the best places to put ad spend right now.

For marketers, that gold rush won't last forever. As more and more advertisers start buying ads on Pinterest, the price of those ads will go up. But that just means more money for PINS.

Their ad inventory is huge – and growing. 400 million monthly actives, growing +50% every year. I don't think it's wholly accurate to call Pinterest. Not that they aren't a social network, but they're also arguably a better image search engine than Google. USP?

They think they can keep going without the need for share dilution but if they have to get more capital, they'll probably sell shares with their ATM offering.

They are avoiding expensive growing methods by using a creative approach announcing the other day that they will be introducing synthetic cannabinoids for the Canadian market for a jaw dropping 10 cents a gram:

Aside from Cronos, I think the ancillary cannabis companies are the way to play weed stocks because they don't contain cannabis and hence allow listing on the most liquid exchanges such as Nasdaq and institutional money can pour into these cannabis related names now/today as opposed to being shut out of other companies that contain cannabis because institutional money usually has mandates to not allow investing in something that is Federally illegal:

Hydrofarm (HYFM) - IPOed in Dec and a leading hydroponics manufacturer and distributor

GrowGeneration (GRWG) - leading hydroponics retailer

Agrify (AGFY) - recent IPO and a hydroponics growing solutions services provider

456,AAPL," I have equal large positions in GrowGeneration (GRWG) and Hydrofarm (HYFM) . GrowGeneration gets much more publicity by being featured on Cramer's Mad Money but it's share price may have gotten ahead of itself valuation wise. 

Hydrofarm is more under the radar and less well known so I would put new money here before GrowGeneration because a little additional publicity for Hydrofarm will cause it leg up again due to its smaller (33 million) shares outstanding. Technicals aside, this a strong future long term just like GRWG does. 

Agrify (AGFY) is magnitudes lower in profit potential than GrowGen or Hydrofarm due the fact that the scalability of a services company is less than a retail or manufacturing operation like GRWG and HYFM are,, respectively, but will be a decent ancillary cannabis play as all boats will be lifted with the rising waters of increasing cannabis interest.

459,MSFT," I have equal large positions in GrowGeneration (GRWG) and Hydrofarm (HYFM) . GrowGeneration gets much more publicity by being featured on Cramer's Mad Money but it's share price may have gotten ahead of itself valuation wise. 

Hydrofarm is more under the radar and less well known so I would put new money here before GrowGeneration because a little additional publicity for Hydrofarm will cause it leg up again due to its smaller (33 million) shares outstanding. Technicals aside, this a strong future long term just like GRWG does. 

Agrify (AGFY) is magnitudes lower in profit potential than GrowGen or Hydrofarm due the fact that the scalability of a services company is less than a retail or manufacturing operation like GRWG and HYFM are,, respectively, but will be a decent ancillary cannabis play as all boats will be lifted with the rising waters of increasing cannabis interest. Agrify has a tiny, tiny share float of only 12 million so it will be a trader's delight with its wild moves and if the call option guys get behind Agrify it will unjustifiably zoom past $50. 

Weedmaps (Silver Spike) - *THIS ONE* is special. It's garnered a tremendous amount of interest already and it hasn't even changed over ticker symbol to Weedmaps yet. Prominent cannabis fund manager and CNBC Fast Money regular, Tim Seymour, is loading up on it ( https://www.amplifyetfs.com/cnbs-holdings.html ) and I am too. Cramer is also giving WeedMaps publicity on Mad Money and suspect he will have it on again after ticker change which will cause it to skyrocket, just like he caused GRWG to skyrocket after having them on for the first time.

PM is definitely the key player/point guard in all of this, but I think they are laying low for fear of public outcry. The big bad wolf. I said this 20+ years ago when I saw PM going down the tubes and every one said I was crazy...I saw big Tobacco going out and said “what are they going to do?” Marijuana! Of course! Both are leaves! They have to grow something in those fields, people want to smoke??? What makes sense? I knew I wasn’t crazy...lol and here we are lol 

Remember what happened to their stake in Juul though, yes “vaping is bad” but is it? Many countries have successfully had smoking cessation with vaping, many MJ users vape it’s the method, not vaping itself and the fact that PM was involved, hence the reason PM has been hiding in the shadows in my opinion. 

They do need a few Republicans for sure, but they can be smoozed that has already been proved, the general public is on board so it’s just a matter of time. 

As far as prices I think this might be “the” dip, especially since wsb caught wind it’s already going back up, I think? I’m not sure it’s going to dip into single digits like AMC. 

You’re definitely right about CBD too, MDs are eagerly opening businesses, I am in a medical state, but my friend who owns a CBD business is a neurologist; what better recommendation is that? 

I think that might be one of the only hiccups, for my state at least and many east coast and newly legalized states, where I am we are very niche, very bougie, small batch - a license is $100,000 per dispensary. To have a flood of marijuana come in that is grown on acres when we are used to little homestead farms - big difference in quality. 

That’s why I say it’s going to be decriminalization federally/removed from the schedule with safe harbor and then the states given full rein but that would still lock out Canada - opening only PM up to the full market. 

PM is point guard, head of class, do not pass go, do not collect $200?

We’ll see there is no other US competition the only thing that even comes close is acreage’s contract with Canopy and the Canadian government, but that would still require full legalization to go into effect.

That's several months off, the time period you're describing. I'm bullish medium- and long-term, but bearish short-term, because we're trading at all-time highs, and we're seeing a ton of speculation bubbles in the market (meme stocks, pot stocks, EV battery stocks).

On some final notes about NMTC though, one thing I’ve just read that is a bit bearish is that their electrode contacts are currently low in count. I don’t know too much about their tech in specific but for reference the lab I work in uses nanofibers that can read from ~100 cells of a mouse brain, and many labs like neuralink have tech that have more than 16 contacts. Of course NMTC could expand their tech so take it with a grain of salt, but it’s definitely worth noting. Last additional insight I can accurately give is to look out for anyone making graphene electrodes in the future, they’re the best (highest charge density, reduced signal noise, less bodily degradation). Imo anyone who can mass produce those in any fashion will probably win out, but admittedly that’s a longer term idea. To further research NMTC i would mostly look into the use of polyimide as an electrode in the brain and how it performs, especially compared to gold as I believe gold is considered the best brain electrode material being used today.

Going to hold onto the remaining 25, but they’ll be a complete afterthought. Since it hit its ATH of around $180, it has been pretty depressing. Just can’t have 2 good days in a row. Even though the market cap seems low, the share price is pretty high in terms of PE. I think C3 will have a bright future, but it will take some time for the shares to be seen as a good value.",Ghola_Mentat,1,/r/stocks/comments/limbwo/future_ai_stock/gn402uy/,0.071,0.673,0.255,0.9783

499,POSH," Take a look at some of the more recent big hype IPOs. They surge out of the gate, then tumble hard.  I put in a market buy for POSH at 48 per thinking that was on the high end, but it came out in the 90s iirc, then tanked hard.

My uneducated take on it is that bigger money has the chance to buy before retail, so they get in at a cheaper price. The stock is then hyped up by a mass of retail buyers, so the price jumps initially. The original investors then dump for an easy win.

I hope we see more companies go with a direct offering in the near future, because I’m curious to see if the same trend occurs. The Roblox IPO, whenever that happens, is on my radar for sure because they’ve opted to go direct.

506,USA, Diversification is the answer... Diversification with home country bias and international exposure and a splash of USA. Easy with all-in-one ETFs.

508,USA," You pick all in one total world ETFs like VT not just one country 

The only countries you can 100% bet on in stocks are free market economies with a history of free trade and high economic growth... The USA traditionally fit that but with Trump and protectionism and other problems it's time to diversify even more. So you can go 100% S&P500 index if you want but you take the risk of America lagging like it did in 2000 to 2010

If you invested only in S&P500 at the peak of the dot com boom in 2000 it would have taken until 2008 for you to recover

The amount of ""loss"" doesn't matter unless you sell. What matters is the gain *after* the loss and diversification against black swan events. If the USA had elected Trump to another term for more trade wars, or the vaccine rollout fails, you could be looking at the world rebounding more. Like I said you can go all in USA, but if a lost decade happens like 2000 to 2010, then you'll lose out on all those gains

Just be aware neither broker offer an ISA, so if you wanted to trade stocks as well as options in an ISA you’ll need to use another broker.
