36,USA," Silver probably will shoot up.  My point is that if they were successful in making rocket like they want, it would absolutely destroy global civilization.  

Virtually all markets are self correcting to some degree.  If you were to buy a bunch of corn because you thought it was going up in price, and you were right, then you would make some money selling it at it's higher price, but some people would switch to other grains that year, and farmers would plant more next year ect. and the price would eventually go back to normal.

Precious metals are a special exception.  People buy them when they lose faith in their currency, especially the USD.  What happens then is that as people turn their dollars into silver/gold, the price of the metal goes up and the price of the dollar goes down.  That further convinces them the dollar is weak, so they turn more of them into metals.  The cycle is a self feedback loop that doesn't end until the USD is worth exactly the paper it's printed on.  Normally this would just destroy the USA, but since so many countries rely on the USD, and furthermore, so many of them rely on trade with the USA, that you would be looking at a global government meltdown.

The Government realized this back around the time of Great Depression, and have been suppressing metal prices since then.

101,GME," Yep, there were the people pumping and dumping (and the people parroting their talking points) that gave a ton of contradictory advice on why you should absolutely buy GME at $350 and you should never sell it.

1. There will be a massive squeeze that will push GME over $1,000 (which is contradictory to the notion of ""never sell"" because the whole point of a squeeze is to sell at the peak)

2. A lot of due diligence about GME possibly pivoting and becoming a successful company in a few years time (which means that you shouldn't be buying during a squeeze anyway and should wait until the fallout)

103,RS," I played RS since 2001. I remember having to gather your own supplies. I remember hunting imps for a fucking week to get a low level quest finished, vs buying beads instantly on the grand exchange for $1k each.

I also remember hustling beads paying noobs 300gp for every bead they find while I was skilling, where people would literally bring me money because they were too stupid to know how to make it for themselves on the exchange.

I remember buying pure ess on free worlds for 10gp and selling it to my members friend for 25gp who turned around and sold it to rune runners for 50gp who ran it to runecrafters for 100gp+ 

Knowledge is the second most important thing out there when everyone has the ability to trade freely and effortlessly, but opportunity is the most important thing. 

I had the knowledge to sell essence for 100 gold each, but I didn't have the opportunity so I took my 15 gold profit happily.

Kids mining the essence 1 at a time selling them for 10 gold had neither the knowledge or the opportunity.

Nowadays everyone has that knowledge and most people have that opportunity, and things kind of even out. To force that on people, only paid-tier members can even mine pure essence now, the expensive runes. Literally the same process, the same tools, the same amount of time but if you pay to get access to the premium server, you get 10x more money for your efforts.

Before the grand exchange, I used to work hard buying weapons from player killers near the player killing area (scims from f2p wildi) for 25k each, to take them across the street and sell them for 30k, 40k each. I saw the fighters take my money and try to buy food with it at a premium to get back to fighting as quick as possible. I started buying fish cheap from fishers off near the skilling areas, taking them to the fighting areas and selling them for twice as much while buying weapons.

Before I knew it, I was trading lobsters for weapons without even wasting time converting it to money first. The same guys would sell me a scim for 25k and buy lobsters from me at like 350 each. If I cut out the cash, I could trade them 20k worth of lobsters for a scim and they'd do it because it meant not spending 10 minutes trying to find a person selling fish because that was 10 minutes not killing people and 10 minutes not collecting more scims.

What I'm getting at is that every market has the potential to be balanced, and every market has the potential to be shit. When trading things, the opportunity is the most important thing because that is what sets the value. If you need money quick, a pawn shop will pay less for it because they know you have little other opportunity and they see a big opportunity for themselves. Equal opportunity paired with widespread knowledge creates true value that allows people to trade fairly and accurately without having to gamble or miss out. Every hands a loser, every hands a winner. That sort of thing.

With the increase in knowledge these last couple of decades, from the increase in virtual economies, we're going to see a shift in how things play out in the real world, with real money. The only thing we have to lookout for and fight for is our opportunity. With enough knowledge spread among enough people we can bruteforce our way into this economy but we have to make sure nobody takes away our opportunity. 

The fairer we make the fight the more they will change the rules to keep us out. To keep us poor, because knowledge and opportunity give us power and power gives us money, but they think money gives them power and that's not how it works. 

Power gives us money because it evens out the playing field and restores balance, but that doesn't mean money gives them power automatically. It only gives them power if we let their money take away our opportunity.",notgayinathreeway,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkhsdq/welcome_new_money/gnknwht/,0.089,0.763,0.148,0.9915

174,AMZN," Hedge funds by definition hold an entire array of stocks to 'hedge' their positions. When they hold stocks like AMZN and TSLA that are pulling in small fortunes each year, they can afford to pay 50 cents/share for GME shorting forever to avoid cashing out at a multi-billion dollar loss.

The reason why the first squeeze went so well before Robinhood broke it by shutting off buying was that the hedgefunds were forced to choose between paying brokers 40% interest on a $300+ stock indefinitely, or buying out at a massive loss.

The fact that brokers are now practically giving away short positions for their stock means that 1) the brokers aren't scrambling to kick the hedge funds off over-shorted positions and 2) the hedge funds with shorts are no longer between a rock and a hard place.

GME may be worth holding, but only to see what Cohen does with it, to see if he can transform the company, or for any secondary reddit pump-and-dump rallies following behind, but the original perfect storm of everyone hopping on to crush the shorters that were fiercely over-shorting GME at a low price and only had one way out has all but vanished.

276,AMC," I think you are onto something. If the norm becomes watching new releases at home, what about the flip side ‚Äîwatching big live events in a theater? Im hoping we see an explosion of creative ideas and new ways to utilize theater spaces, because there will be pent up demand for novel things to do.

Theaters are stuck in the dark ages with their fixed schedules, and they are totally underutilized, inactive spaces much of the time. With more creative leadership they could easily use apps to provide more complex offerings ‚Äîone click to rent out a theater on demand for you and friends, and watch anything you want. The same app could make it much easier for corporations to reserve a theater for their lame power point mtgs to the whole company. 

My ideas are pretty obvious, but hopefully AMC can think of a better way to use tech to optimize asset utilization. They need their Ryan Cohen.

The two numbers are very different. If AMC were roughly 30x bigger, sure, it would be worth more, but it isn't.

The main argument against AMC is that AMC lost money in 2019; so if by magic AMC returns to normal in 2022 and the world goes back to what it was, AMC just loses money more slowly compared to the current era.

289,AMC," Reasons I feel AMC is in trouble:

* They've issued a lot of stock and debt to cover them through the pandemic.
   * It's overvalued. Their value in 2019 was close to $11 billion. Now it's up to a little over $13 billion based on stock price. And with all the debt and money they've raised that value can be estimated at over $15 billion. It shouldn't be worth more now than it was before anyone knew about the pandemic.
* As the OP's DD described above, people weren't going to the movies even before the pandemic. Attendance was way down in 2019.
   * Foot traffic was down by 8% in 2019 over 2018 and this has been a long trend for AMC.
* Theaters are open now and people still aren't attending. Who wants to watch a movie with the chance of getting sick, wear a mask throughout the movie, and pay those prices when you could watch at home.
   * Here's how they are doing attendance-wise since reopening in August:
      * September: Down 88%
      * October: Down 92%
      * November: Down 93%
      * December: Down 95%
      * January: 93%
* Big TV's are more accessible now than ever and streaming is easy. In fact many of the movies are getting released in the theaters and streaming services. Over time the movie theaters are losing patrons and not gaining them. This does not look good for long-term growth.
* If the movie producers continue to offer streaming services in place or along side of theatrical releases, AMC is done by 2022. 

The argument that once this pandemic is all over, people will be back in the theaters is compelling but based on the numbers, I doubt it. Less people were going to the theaters every year before the pandemic and when big movies like Wonder Woman and Tenent rolled out, no one came. They streamed the movies. 

AMC will just issues more shares and take on more debt to keep carrying them through this and that share price will keep gradually going down. You could hold for a year and hope it comes back up, but in the meantime you're missing out. This isn't the year for AMC to come back and I'm not sure what the future holds for them.",pandatears420,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljz99b/amc_blockbuster_dd/gnk534e/,0.081,0.86,0.059,-0.6434

368,AMD," Great post!

Just to add, 

1. LEAPs require a ton of fundamental research because you need to have strong faith in the company, the market, and the management's ability to execute flawlessly.


2. Try to buy at low IV. LEAPs generally have less IV when compared to the weeklies but they can be high (relative to their own past IV) if you buy at the wrong time.


3. You need to time the exit. Holding on to the leap until the last minute can be a gamble just like the weeklies are. One bad quarter can take the price down and keep it low. Especially with cyclicals like semiconductors. Or even if the company is doing well, the broader market can tank and take your leap with it.

For example, with AMD right now there's a huge chip shortage across the world and all chip manufacturers are ramping up their capacity. What happens next is inevitable. Too much supply causes price fluctuations and the margins go down. When that happens is the question. Could it be different this time around? Certainly, there's a scenario where no amount of production will meet the demand and semiconductor stocks can keep going up. But no knows for sure if that'll be the case. AMD is probably a great long term play but be especially careful if you're dealing with a leap in the cyclicals but this is also true with any business. You need to have a strong conviction.

Ultra growth companies are usually the best candidates for this, imo.

Not an investment advice.

Otherwise, even if I teach my strike price theta would kill most of my gains and those monthly options would actually bet me significantly more. Basically I will buy contracts that are dated 1.5-2.5x the time it would take for that option to reach that price.

380,TA," What a great post! I'm new to WSB, but have been an investor/part time trader for years. I've noticed that there's a lot of smart retards here at WSB's. I'm more of TA guy and buy my options based on timing. FD's can be soooo profitable if you know what your doing, but you have to get in and out. Example.  I waited for Zoom's bull flag to breakout last week. I watched it consolidate for a few days prior on both the 30 min and 15 min charts. Once it broke $419 with volume I started to search for options. My target was $440. Now, knowing it would hit $440 within 2 days, I looked at the weekly options expiring the 12th. I think it broke out on the 8th or 9th. Now this only gives me 3-4 days until they expire. I search for the highest delta and gamma and calculate the best value per contract. I found a $435 strike with .41 delta with a 16% gamma for $420 per contract. $4.20 x100 shares=$420 .So for every dollar Zoom goes up, my contract goes up $41 with a 16% increase per dollar. Now, this is the basis of my calculations. Delta and gamma do change as the stock moves in either direction, however trading on a breakout with volume and being 90% sure that my target will be hit, I know that those #'s could increase in my favor. To be safe, I always calculate off what's listed on the contract. My goal is to never exercise the option and get out at a profit. I think realistically and never expect it to hit the strike right away. All I'm thinking is that for every dollar this bitch goes up, I will make $41x16%= $6.56+$41=$47.56 per contract. It's simple math! Now, I know your all retarded so you might have to ask your 7 year old to help you with this. We all know that delta and gamma change when the stock moves, but since I'm confident that the stock was going up and my plan was to get out in a day or two, I'm not worried about that. I picked the $435 strike because the delta and gamma gave me better value then the $440 and has a better chance of hitting $435 or close within the short time period. Listen up handjob's, when buying short term option's, your goal is not to hit the strike price. It doesn't have to. You want the asset to move in the direction of the strike price within a favorable time period in order to make your $$$ and get the fuck out! If you sit there and say to your retarded self, ""Oh fuck, I was up and now it went down, but I still have 3 days to hit my strike price"", you will be forced to wear a skirt and sell your body, because you would have lost all your $. You'll be standing on the side of the road holding a bag of cheeseburgers yelling ""Yo, I'll suck yo dick maan""! Don't be greedy!!! Take your 10% or 40% and run like Forest gump!! On this trade, I made 140%! yes 140% . 3 contracts x$420= $1260. Sold the contracts within the first hour of the next day when Zoom was $433 and my option was $1068 per contract. Cashed out for like $3200. It doesn't always work like that, but buying short term options upon breakout's using technical analysis can be very profitable. If you can spot future potential breakout's or watch them long enough ahead of time and keeping an eye on them before breakout, buying weekly's is the way to go! If not , your just gambling against time! I would spend the extra dough and go further out to give the asset more time. Also, you need to know when to fold as well. If your down 15% on an option purchase and you know you fucked up because the chart is moving in the opposite direction, then get the fuck out! Chances are, you could 1. Buy the contracts cheaper, or if you like the stonk buy it cheaper. Don't wait and pray to the option's god's that it will moon in the next 2 days. This is why Leap's could be a better choice for a lot of you degenerates retards.

Supply exceeds demand, prices tank, startups start churning out prototypes; a few will make it to production, demand increases again, prices return to normal for a while and growth continues. 

The real question will be how many EVs go to market over the next few years and how much demand comes from advancements in other tech. If the flooded market drives innovation in any meaningful way, eventually the demand will grow to meet the supply.

409,GOOG," You need much more to invest in a leap than say an investment with a 3 month outlook. 

To give an example, it was known very well Google's Q4 was going to be great. Because of the acceleration in the shift to digital even more so after covid, ad bugets surged around September to more than pre-covid levels, 2020 elections, and Google even refused some ads because they didn't have the slots.

Could I have played Google with this like a 2 or a 3 month call? Absolutely. (I didn't, just giving an example).

But would I ever buy a GOOG leap? Probably not. I don't think the management is the best. Their cloud is probably always going to be a laggard vs Microsoft and Amazon. They have a social media component (Youtube) and there are some political uncertainties around that. They've failed at/lagged in pretty much every non-software, real-world component. Alexa trumped Google Assistant even though Google's technical expertise is probably more superior. Nest and other devices are doing ok only in the segments where they don't have any competition. They theoretically have a zillion ways to monetize the data they have like starting a travel agency, e-commerce but I think those ships have sailed. Bothnin terms of competition and the new found regulatory interest in monopolies.

If I'm investing in a leap I go thru every corner of their balance sheet, I read every analyst report I can find (some of the analysts out there extrapolate the whole balance sheet for the next few quarters/years, that's a very valuable data).

I also go thru the technicals, IV data, historic option pricing, competitior's outlook etc.

Not to mention if you're buying a short term call you probably don't have to worry about interest rates at all but if it's a year or a couple years out, you should definitely look at the macro situation as well.

It was a fucking pain in the ass trying to close them because I could only close the short position first, pray for some large upward movement then sell the long position.

Someone else asked - and I'm not sure of the answer - if the brokerage would force you to exercise the leap if the short call gets assigned.

491,GO," For all you tards out there that can't read, I'll break down this post line by line to show you that this guy is either an idiot or trying to suppress price of SLV so someone can get their hands on their bars for cheaper.

1) ""People buy SLV shares, making SLV buy silver and ship it to their vaults (sureeee...)""

That's not how this works.  When someone buys a share of SLV, they're buying it off some other tard, not from the ETF.  SLV gets no money when shares are bought and sold - they're just in the market.

The way SLV gets its bars, and creates new shares, is someone with actual fucking physical bars, each with a serial number and a weight stamped on it, delivers 50koz of bars to SLV.  SLV then gives that person some shares, and that person can then sell those shares on the market to some tards.  That person is called an Authorized Participant, or an ""AP"".

2) ""Silver prices barely increase even though premiums are extremely high and bullion dealers are struggling to ship orders due to the massive demand.""

What silver prices? Futures? Comex spot?  SLV?  These are all separate markets that trade different things, but some tards seem to think it is all the same and are willing to pay the same price for a piece of paper that says ""I'll give you what I say 5000oz of silver is worth in 30 days"" and 5 real hard 1000oz bars of actual silver.  Not my fault dipshits are willing to pay the same for the paper promise as for the real thing.

3) ""What's likely happening is that SLV didn't buy shit and is actually keeping your dollars...to guess what ? To buy silver when it's cheaper.""

I dont even know where to start with this one.  WHEN YOU BUY SHARES THE MONEY DOESN'T GO TO SLV, IT WORKS LIKE EVERY OTHER STOCK - THE PERSON YOU BOUGHT FROM GETS THE MONEY, FUCKWIT.

4) ""But how is that called, when instead of buying something, you sell it and hope to buy it back at a lower price...mhm ? That's right, shorting.""

What does this even have to do with anything?  The whole thing devloves basically in to word salad at this point.  Mix in a bunch of words like leverage, IV, naked shorting.

Oh, and PSLV, it works *exactly the same way as SLV*.  SLV creates new shares when, you guessed it, they take actual delivery of additional silver in their bank's vaults.  You can actually go to a warehouse in western Chicago and watch forklifts drive pallets of the shit back and forth between buildings if you want.

I'll end with:

""This isn't financial advice of any sort. I'm not qualified to give any.""

506,AP," I suspect someone big is trying to drive down the price of SLV to match the funny money paper cash settled futures prices.  Probably doing this because they need to get their hands on physical for industrial use or something.  If you can't get physical from futures delivery any more (because they'll just settle in cash), and futures diverge from actual physical prices, where do you go to get actual bars to run your factory?  That's right, you buy 100k shares of SLV, drop them off with your AP who will deliver the shares to the ETF, who then effectively deletes the shares in exchange for depository receipts for an equivalent number of bars.

510,SD," $SLV only holds 1000oz good-delivery bars, held in professional bullion vaults.  It takes time, money, and effort to convert 1000oz bars into consumer-sized bullion coins and bars.

The pricing in different sections of the silver market is highly complicated by this lack of interchangeability.  So a DTC (direct to consumer) site like APMEX or JM Bullion or SD Bullion needs more bars.  This is what has to happen to get oz of silver from a COMEX vault -> consumer holding a 1oz round:

- DTC site re-orders rounds

- bullion producers re-orders blanks from wholesaler/middleman producer 

- wholesaler buys near month futures on COMEX

- wholesaler stands for delivery

- wholesaler hauls the bars to their facilities

- wholesaler melts it down and casts it into blanks

- wholesaler ships blanks to the bullion producer

- bullion producer finally makes the rounds

- bullion producer ships the rounds to the DTC seller

- DTC site FINALLY has stock to allow you to order


Also keep in mind that at EVERY step along the way, the metal has to be securely transported, insured, and fiat cash floated around to everyone involved in the middle of a highly volatile market.  The volatility actually makes every player at every step MORE scared of taking on risk, b/c if the mania doesn't last, they could be stuck with silver that they bought at a high spot price, and now they can't recover that cost.  Hedging that risk with futures also requires credit and/or capital and has it's own carrying costs associated.

Don't you think that someone, somewhere, with a list of their own serial numbers, might check to see if SLV also claims to own them?  Look up how the comex vault system works - many brokers, many vaults, and different ""classes"" of silver.  Read up on the difference between allocated and unallocated.  Since there are many brokers, any manipulation of the allocated deposits would take serious coordination in a massive conspiracy spanning multiple banks.  If JP Morgan says ""Hey Brinks, can you alter your lists for me so we don't show duplicate bars?"", do you think Brinks is going to call up the warehouse dude, or do you think Brinks is going to call the FBI?

Allocated bars cannot be lent out, but also cannot be used for settlement of futures - this is what SLV holds.  Unallocated bars can be lent, but the person who owns it understands this (because they actually probably got an education in how this stuff works before their investment bank let them trade the company money on futures), and so isn't worried about it, because they don't actually want the silver, they want to trade futures.",jaycrft,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkgtyx/get_out_of_slv_now_if_you_are_long_silver/gnk8wn9/,0.039,0.939,0.022,-0.163

When I read it it sounds like their saying if there is a silver shortage they won't be able to issue new shares, which could effect shareholder price adversely as it will effect the liquidity of shares and won't track NAV anymore. Each share will still be backed by an ounce of silver. The shares though might not be trading the same as the silver backing them though if they are unable to issue new shares.

PSLV will have the same problem if silver becomes hard to acquire (except supposedly they are buying direct from miners as opposed to slv buying it on auction, which I'm sketched about it because their is no guarantee of quality)

What I personally like about $SLV so much is that it is an exchange traded product so there are conventional call and put options on it.  If you believe a move is coming, you can make a speculative play that is magnified MANY times due to the leveraging power of options.  And holy shit let me tell you, as some one who has done both, is it both easier and cheaper to buy and sell $SLV than it is to buy and sell coins.  That LCS that sold you an eagle for $42 + tax?

555,MA,"  This is another update of my previous Tesla ideas. I personally don't own Tesla stocks at this point. I've made some profit by trading the breakout of  the triangle, which is paired with the announcement for the inclusion  of the Tesla stock to the Standard & Poor 500 Index. This event gained a lot of exposure and traction. Only a few  months after the splitting of the stock (basically to make it achievable  again for the masses).   
 Elon knows when and how to place tweets, announcement or hints for  future events. It seems like he's watching the chart and spots the  technical breakout points (with us together) and then he drops the  tweet. Let's keep that in mind.   
 

The expectation for the inclusion was followed by huge volume at the 18th of december. Another upcoming event were the earnings, which were - at least in some eyes - disappointing. At least this is  the information that we can get from the chart. We saw a decent sell-off  and profit-taking from those who where in this run during the strong  surge in price.    
 Since then, we see the price moving sideways while making Lower Highs  and Lower Lows (Descending Horizontal Channel). This aligns with a Death  Cross of the MA 50 & MA 200 (yellow highlight). That's when the  price previously formed a triangle, caused by indecision between buyers  & sellers.

567,FSD," > When you‚Äôre the most valuable company in the world and no one can really point to anything concrete as to why

FSD looks to break out this year

They've reduced their footprint by eliminating the massive dryers for battery production. That means they can produce more batteries in the same space as competitors.

Their energy sector growth is fucking massive yoy.

They are eliminating 300 robots. 300. Fucking 300. That's a third improvement in line speed. Then when they cast the front end they will eliminate another 300. That means triple production, ballpark.

Their factories build faster than weeds.

Their factories are now (potentially) three times as efficient.

They are building out in India. 

Their 4680 cells are thermodynamically a huge breakthrough.

Their semis will result in profits but also 100k FSD sales on every single semi. That's huge.

Their autonomous driving has the potential to eat Uber and Lyft and all taxis eventually if you hold.

25k car. That's a huge market penetration. Estimated as soon as a March reveal/approval. But even if it isn't and it's next year that will mean a massive market shift especially with subscription FSD.

Oh, subscription FSD as a constant source of revenue.

571,TA," A death cross is when the short term moving average falls below the long term moving average. The typical averages used are the 50 day for short term and 200 day for long term. Although 30 and 100 day are used as well. It's a technical indicator that's signaling a stall in long term upward movement combined with a sell off in the short term as the smart money starts locking in profits. They're usually accompanied by a volume spike.

It's considered a very reliable indicator of some of the most severe price crashes over the last century. Entire indices had death crosses prior to 1929, 1938, 1974, and 2008. Because it's considered a long term indicator it carries more weight than a short term pattern like a doji.

590,CEO," That‚Äôs up to you, Lucid isn‚Äôt a true competitor to Tesla  and I don‚Äôt think their price action is a zero sum game. Lucid, to me, is the first true high quality EV manufacturer since Tesla, but is geared at competing with Mercedes and BMW. They don‚Äôt have major red flags in regards to staff, product, funding, and technology that I can identify. Lucid seems to have a solid foundation on all fronts, including their possible merge target and their respective staff. This is all my opinion, but when I initially heard of the merge, I did a 10 hour crash course on both companies and decided to buy in at $16. Elon Musk (blessed be his corporate future) is adding to his goal of engendering a sea change in personal vehicle use.

591,EV," That‚Äôs up to you, Lucid isn‚Äôt a true competitor to Tesla  and I don‚Äôt think their price action is a zero sum game. Lucid, to me, is the first true high quality EV manufacturer since Tesla, but is geared at competing with Mercedes and BMW. They don‚Äôt have major red flags in regards to staff, product, funding, and technology that I can identify. Lucid seems to have a solid foundation on all fronts, including their possible merge target and their respective staff. This is all my opinion, but when I initially heard of the merge, I did a 10 hour crash course on both companies and decided to buy in at $16.

637,IMO," Oil is only rising because OPEC+ is limiting supply. Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, and others are voluntarily deflating supply to reduce prices. Parts of that deal began to ease in January.

Nations like Russia are ready to pump more [as soon as they can](https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN2A920H).

Saudi Arabia voluntarily cut an additional 1 million bpd, which is [set to come back into the market after March](https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSL1N2KG120).

That‚Äôs not to mention the increased focus on climate, accelerating proliferation of EVs, Biden‚Äôs order restricting oil and gas leases on federal land, the global energy transition, plummeting prices for renewable energy and storage, etc.

719,DD," 1) No, it isn't, I was invested in shale before you had ever even heard of it - the technology for horizontal drilling is more valuable than the U.S. Shale industry itself. Even though what the US has accomplished in the last decade is remarkable, there are a lot of questions as to whether or not it is sustainable as Saudi Arabia keeps it under siege. Just look at what happened a year ago to Shale, and that was before Covid had taken hold. It's an extremely unstable industry, investing in it is like playing with fire (and so is US LNG, before you even go looking into that).

2) You're making a big assumption on transportation for the Summer post Covid while thinking 60$ oil in Winter is a price indicator towards a positive trend. The price of oil will go up in Summer, but not from where it is now. It'll go up from Fall prices, which I think will be mid 40s.

3) I literally used to work with Exxon, and you're posting DD on WSB ... do you really want to talk about who is not educated about oil here?

I wouldn't follow oil traders that blindly considering the majority of them aren't in the industry itself, you're talking about the same people who got absolutely raped over storage shortage fears that never materialized last year - they invented loss porn before they even knew what it was.

721,IMO," Yes, look at a price chart for oil by month and you'll see Winter is typically when the oil price spikes and company evaluations go up. You can correlate this in different ways, one way is to compare it with a petrocurrency and see when its at its highs and lows relative to the dollar. That's why oil price is typically evaluated year on year, you'll find exceptions here and there but they are usually event driven (politics, sanctions, manipulation, war etc). Just pointing to the current price of oil in Winter and record cold as an indicator for a future price is really suspect reasoning.

So high price in a Winter month with a snap freeze is a given, while high price in a driving season with a pandemic is speculating. Oil companies are not a bad investment given last year, but you need at least a 2 year outlook IMO for fundamentals. The market is also drunk right now, everything seems to be going up because reasons ... 80$ Summer oil price is really bullish, that's like going back to 2017 and forgetting about Covid altogether.",Whistling_Birds,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lk1pdl/repost_of_my_oil_play_dd_last_chance_before_the/gnjdh55/,0.082,0.864,0.054,-0.7445

723,GME," Definitely. It was actually really interesting to be right in the thick of the GME ramp-up, and to have been following it since December, and then to hear what was being said about it on CNBC. Because they clearly didn't have a fucking clue what they were talking about. It felt like they spent all of ten minutes putting in any research, and then just said shit in an authoritarian ""I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT"" tone of voice.  
  
It was just really eye-opening for me. Not that I didn't logically think that already, but it felt different when I was actually involved. Is this just... what they do all the time, about everything?

These include terms like, transgenderism, black lives matter, intersectionality, white supremacy etc. There really just are too many coincidences to simply wave this off and think they are not coordinated in some manner.

What did we see with the recent GME squeeze? Media talking about how WSB is racist, it's an attack on jews and so on, lmao, there's TOO MUCH coincidence.

fake marijuana analysts everywhere finally realize retail marijuana stores *don't fucking matter* **due to the overwhelming amount of new stores planned to open post legalization.** 

People pitching MSOs with heavy retail commitments are fucking stupid. What's the closest thing to marijuana? Tobacco or alcohol. Who are are the biggest companies there? Marlboro and Budweiser. 

How many retail stores do they own combined? Exactly. I'm sick of these pot experts not even understanding basic business, let alone business within the cannabis industry. 

This is some shit DD. Lol

How bout you retards go look for the MSO with  4 retail locations, 500,000sqft of grow, and impeccable branding across flower and all derivatives. Those are the ones ready to explosively grow with legalization, and also shows you their leadership is capable of looking forward to a national and international market instead of opening 90 stores in the same fucking state. ü§¶.

and i saw my account value had exploded, from around \~30 bucks to 6.5k!!! wtf how did this happen? one of the garbage stocks i held was GTLL some pink sheet garbage known as ""Global technologies ltd"" i have 300,000 shares i bought for much less than a penny, and now it's exploded in value to around .02-.03 cents. i was floored.

now i would sell but honestly weed stocks are all the rage right now, so i think i will hold it's not like i need the money right now anyways.

\*\*edit-GTLL is apparently a weed stock look em up. this isn't solid DD or anything just a pure coincidence but i figured it's relevant to the thread since it's currently a penny stock\*\*",lolgreglol,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkdu3w/cannabis_stocks_are_going_bongkers_ultimate_dd/gnkl5x6/,0.079,0.834,0.087,0.2259

819,CO," weed is going to crash hard if it becomes legal and i think it prob will under biden. imo  you want to get out right as legalization is passed. its going to sky rocket and wont get past that since:

1 you dont have to worry about cops it becomes really easy to grow dank weed. a lot if not most legal weed grown in the usa ends up being sold and moved to states its not legal because they can make more profit but also they are producing more then the stores can sell.

Also once Marlboro and other tobacco companies can start selling they will destroy local sales. they will have shit out so fast if is federally legal. edibles and other produced products will tank in price and the shitty weed market will be taken over from there  those 1$ shake joints do add up to a lot of money for business. (and maybe the high end tho idk how well they could actually supply that).  those 1$ shake joints do add up to a lot of money for business.

people will still want the dankest but again its not hard to grow so much so the average person can easily maintain their own supply+ so i think that market will go even more local like trading/farm market type deal.

As someone with over 5 years experience working with MSOs, and currently managing one (not traded), allow me to educate you, google warrior. 

>""US MSOs ARE in the best position to capitalize on the US market when Canada doesn't get access to sell into the US.""

Not really. There's no reason to expect any explosive form of growth from MSOs unless they expand to move into a newly recreational state, or already operate in a state going from medical to recreational. 

If they expand to a new state, first I just want to say thank you for again paying for retail space. Me and my investments sure hope you went for that one big building on the corner of that big city that costs a fuck ton. Obviously costs us nothing, but we are *pumped* to add our products to those shelves. 

If they are in a State that is switching from medical to recreational, it is going to depend on the laws there. No question retail stores will see an increase in sales due to availability, but will MSOs be allowed to expand as big as they want to capture as much of the market as possible? Probably not, and even if they can expand, they will pay one hell of a **premium** to do so as long as it's not Federally green lit. 

>""The limits on retail licenses will slow/cap growth to retail-store focused companies. Which is why focusing on brands/wholesale is paramount, as you can sell to any store. (Bars carrying MillerLite or Bud Light)"" 

If you're arguing for a scenario where in state only is still allowed, then you're again **wrong.** A producer is going to be much more limited in how much product they can produce than a store will be limited how many customers it can see. The limit in an in state recreational market is on the creation, not the selling, if anything. So while a grower is only allowed xx,xxx growing space, a retail store is allowed to buy products from x amount of producers and sell them all to customers. Retailer being unlimited in their profits versus their producer counterparts.

And for those of us making a calculated bet that there could be follow-up stimulus in a Biden administration that favors domestic auto manufacturers, airlines, rail, and infrastructure, it's a pretty solid investment. Oh, and Ford is about to release the Bronco, which is going to be wildly successful. My only regret is that I didn't buy the stock last spring. Stocks don't have to double or triple to be good picks. I'm happy buying stock if it provides 5%+ ROI over a period of 1-2 years.

951,CEO," I like this stock. 

The new CEO seems great. I think what they're doing in Asia is really smart (Gucci partnership!). And Asia is open and its a culture that loves brands and dressing up. 

As people get vaccinated the weather gets nicer people will be going out again and will want to look nice. There will probably even be an uptick in weddings and special events too.  

Speaking personally as a women, at this point I pretty much need an entire new collection of make up - that stuff doesn't last forever and its been a while since I bought any. I'm sure I'm not alone in that. The Kylie line has been getting a lot of buzz on social media. Chrissy Tegan storied about how much she loved it.

960,COTY," Everyone shitting on this should visit a Target store. Stores still have heavy foot traffic despite the pandemic, and many stores have updated beauty sections which offer a more upmarket shopping experience more like a Sephora...and a whole bunch of the product in these Target beauty sections is COTY product. Foot traffic in all stores (target, walmart, walgreens, etc) will increase as COVID rates and restrictions decrease. Infection and hospitalization counts are dropping every day so more in store traffic = more sales. 

Also keep in mind that expansion to Asia should be huge...the middle class in China is what, like 300 million people? And life there is much more ""back to normal"" than it is here in America. I have been to Hong Kong and seen girls spend thousands and filling full size suitcases with makeup and skin product. Poke around on Google maps and see how many makeup shops there are...for example, there's literally one on every block in the Tsim Sha Tsui neighborhood, and they're all packed elbow to elbow from open to close at 11pm. It's insane. 

Will COTY üöÄüöÄ 3x, or even 2x any time soon? Nope...but there's definitely money to be made here. I have doubled my money and then some.

So, coty needs to cut brands to get company to focus on their best brands then build a lot of new products to esch of the major brands...this js what brings growth but also better margins since advertising dollars is spent more effectively. When you spend $10mm in a brand that has 1 product it js less efficient than if it has 20 products that caters to different people or price points.

1003,CEO, Since I am not an insider it would be impossible for me to know what brands they will get rid of but it is clear which brands they want to keep building on. It is clear though that some brands need to be sold to increase focus on the main brands. It was stated by the CEO and even before she arrived made a lot of sense given they had way too many brands.  The cost cutting is actually the easy part. The hard part will be how the brands release new products and categories within the same brand.,ValueMaverick,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lk287t/why_you_should_buy_coty_this_week_worth_10_to_30/gni8ek1/,0.031,0.83,0.139,0.9136

1039,IRS," You must pay the lesser of 90% of your current year tax or 100% of your prior year tax (110% of prior year if you're not poor and last year adjusted gross income was over $150k) prior to December 31 to avoid underpayment penalties.

I don't know if these comments are jokes or not but:

1. An extension only grants you more time to file the return. All taxes are due on April 15th. Failure to pay by this date incurs penalties and interest, with or without an extension.

2. Future tax years have no bearing on the current/prior year (other than an NOL which I won't even go into as it doesn't apply to any of you retards). If you have $200k in gains on 2020 you are paying taxes on $200k in gains. That's it. Doesnt matter if you've already lost it all.

3. If you've genuinely lost almost everything, have no assets, and paying your tax is near impossible you can file an Offer in Compromise (OIC) which basically tells the IRS that it will take you 87000 years giving HJs to earn enough to pay them. I've seen them accept $5k-$10k for people who owe hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes.

4. Making any financial move to ""get/keep the deduction"" is retarded. This is a financial cope used by poors to justify their dumb decisions. It can factor in to your assessment of the net cost of a move, but should never be the deciding factor.

1049,ANY," This isn't accurate.   You can only write off taxes for losses against taxes for gains.  Well, most of the time.  They do let you write off losses against regular income, but only $3,000 of it.

Example (not autobiographical)

- Made $600k in 2020 in investments
- Lost 300k in 2021
- Continued making $7.50/hr as a sandwich artist

You can NOT write off ANY of that $300K against the $600k in the previous year.  Only up to $3,000 against your Subway pay in 2021.  And good luck because you're below the Standard Deduction anyway because you don't have a ""real"" job, so you possibly can't write off ANY of your losses.

-	Zillow can and will get ahead once their tech matches OPEN.  Zillow already has national presence and they can penetrate markets quicker

Look at who runs this spyware......

Gil Shwed is the co-founder and CEO of Check Point. 
Shwed and other top Check Point directors have strong ties to Israel‚Äôs military ‚Äì the Israeli Defence Force (IDF). In particular, several have backgrounds in elite military intelligence units. During his military service, Shwed served in the Israeli military‚Äôs Intelligence Unit 8200, which has similar functions to the National Security Agency (NSA) in the United States. Both Intelligence Unit 8200 and the NSA are involved in cyber intelligence, in spying on on the population through the mass-collection of electronic data.

Dorit Dor is the Vice-President of Products at Check Point. Not just an enlisted soldier, Dor was a career cyber-spy spending eight years in the IDF. Like Shwed, Dor served in its Intelligence Unit 8200. She won the Israel Defense Prize in 1993. The award is presented by the President of Israel to those who, in the state‚Äôs eyes, make significant contributions to the defence of the state of Israel.

Marius Nacht also co-founded the company, and is currently Chairman of the Board. He spent eight years in the Israeli Air Force, and was a graduate of the ‚ÄòTalpiot Program‚Äô, supposedly the IDF‚Äôs ‚Äúmost elite unit‚Äù. Talpiot accepts a small number of cadets every year, who are required to enlist for ten years and are taught advanced physics, mathematics and computer science, in order to develop technology and counter-intelligence programmes.

The Times of Israel describes Talpiot soldiers as having had ‚Äúan impact on every weapon and communications system used by the IDF and every tool used by Israel‚Äôs intelligence community.‚Äù According to a book about the unit, Talpiots have ‚Äúdeveloped battle-ready weapons that only Israel‚Äôs top military officers and political leaders know about. They have also dramatically improved much of the weapons already in Israel‚Äôs arsenal.‚Äù

THE CYBER INDUSTRY & ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT

The Israeli state‚Äôs regulatory system ensures that there is much collaboration between the government and private cyber companies like Check Point. In 1974, the Israeli government‚Äôs Ministry of Defense introduced encryption-control licensing legislation. Journalists Matthew Waxman and Doron Hindin explain what this means in practice:

‚ÄúIsraeli authorities are apprised of the latest encryption and cyber developments and position the government to engage effectively with the private sector when national security risks are identified.‚Äù

The Prime Minister‚Äôs department, the Israel National Cyber Directorate, also has the goal of ‚Äúinvesting dedicated resources‚Äù in the cyber industry. The department ‚Äúenhances the cooperation and synergy between the private sector, the government and international partners.‚Äù Check Point‚Äôs Gil Shwed regularly speaks at events which also host Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Mossad chief Yossi Cohen, as well as the Director General of the Israel National Cyber Directorate.

On top of this, most business people in Israel‚Äôs lucrative cyber industry have been trained in certain IDF units. As outlined above, Check Point‚Äôs Shwed and Dor served in Unit 8200, while Nacht served in the most elite unit of all. Waxman and Hindin say:

‚ÄúMany high-tech innovators began their careers in Israeli military intelligence, and they continue to support former units as reservists. Israel‚Äôs small population and mandatory conscription policy further supports the reciprocal relationship between Israeli civilian business and its defense establishment. The Israel Defense Forces are also known to actively support their veterans‚Äô economic success following discharge.‚Äù

CHECK POINT AND THE ISRAELI ARMS INDUSTRY

In 2016, Check Point teamed up with Israeli arms company, Israel Aerospace Industries, to form a consortium called IC3. Israeli Aerospace Industries is one of Israel‚Äôs largest weapons manufacturers. The consortium, IC3, was established by the Israeli government‚Äôs Ministry of Economy, and was set up to ‚Äúaddress technological-cyber needs at a national and governmental level.‚Äù The IC3 ‚Äúoffers end-to-end solutions for national cyber systems.‚Äù One key job that the IC3 has is to work with the government of Japan, preparing for the 2020 Olympics.

In November 2018, Check Point launched another consortium, IAC3, along with the Israeli government‚Äôs Economy Ministry, IAI and other companies. IAC3‚Äôs statement said that the consortium had been set up ‚Äúto offer comprehensive, end-to-end cybersecurity solutions for the commercial aviation industry: airports, airlines and aircraft.‚Äù


All this may not be a problem since allied governments would benefit from the insight Checkpoint can provide, but the probability that IDF is looking at your traffic is high if you are a company/org of interest.",lofiminimalist,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkaemj/dd_for_checkpoint_chkp/gniuhuh/,0.015,0.879,0.106,0.9932

1112,IT," As a network security engineer, Check Point and many of their competitors are in a tough spot long term for a few reasons IMHO:  


* Palo Alto is the big name in town for enterprise these days for those *still* wanting on-prem firewalls/NGFW.  Fortinet is bigger in the SMB, Med Size business.
* Look at any of the professional networking/sysadmin subreddits like r/networking or r/sysadmin.  You rarely see mention of Check Point as a suggestion for questions about firewalls.  It's always Palo Alto or Fortinet or Cisco (because boomer IT departments love Cisco).  
* AWS has released their own cloud native firewall ([https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/](https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/)) which is going to eat into the space for all firewall vendors who advertise their ""Cloud NGFW appliances"".  Industry best practice is going to be (if not already) using as much of the cloud providers native networking and security tools. Using a  3rd-party cloud appliance, from Check Point, Palo, Fortinet, Cisco, etc, would be considered a lazy effort.
* The traditional firewall in general is a dead business.  Cloud native is how every company is doing things.  Think companies like Zscaler and Cloudflare which are taking over security for cloud focused enterprises for Remote Access, Zero Trust, and SASE deployments.  Sure Palo Alto has Prisma for ""cloud security"" and Check Point has ""Cloud Guard/Dome9"", but these aren't products given serious consideration in the SRE/DevOps space.

Everything I'm saying is based on my own personal bias.  **However, anyone in this space knows that these network security companies are in a vulnerable state due to cloud disruption.**  Infrastructure-as-Code is how IT departments are transforming themselves.  The Datacenter is disappearing.  I personally see less and less relevant for companies like Check Point, Fortinet, Palo Alto or even Cisco in today's IT environments. They are no longer competing against just each other, but against native cloud providers like AWS and Azure.

* AWS has released their own cloud native firewall ([https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/](https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/)) which is going to eat into the space for all firewall vendors who advertise their ""Cloud NGFW appliances"".  Industry best practice is going to be (if not already) using as much of the cloud providers native networking and security tools. Using a  3rd-party cloud appliance, from Check Point, Palo, Fortinet, Cisco, etc, would be considered a lazy effort.
* The traditional firewall in general is a dead business.  Cloud native is how every company is doing things.  Think companies like Zscaler and Cloudflare which are taking over security for cloud focused enterprises for Remote Access, Zero Trust, and SASE deployments.  Sure Palo Alto has Prisma for ""cloud security"" and Check Point has ""Cloud Guard/Dome9"", but these aren't products given serious consideration in the SRE/DevOps space.

Everything I'm saying is based on my own personal bias.  **However, anyone in this space knows that these network security companies are in a vulnerable state due to cloud disruption.**  Infrastructure-as-Code is how IT departments are transforming themselves.  The Datacenter is disappearing.  I personally see less and less relevant for companies like Check Point, Fortinet, Palo Alto or even Cisco in today's IT environments. They are no longer competing against just each other, but against native cloud providers like AWS and Azure.

The ""cloud"" sentiment is happening whether its your thing or not.  The biggest companies on earth are abandoning their data centers.  It is simply more cost and risk effective.  Will it happen tomorrow? No. But it is a fact that pure cloud is going to be the dominant way IT departments function in the future.  We'll see ""hybrid cloud"" for a while, but it wont last.  


Regulatory and compliance requirements are changing regulations to accommodate cloud only environments as everyone agrees this is the way forward.

1133,BSM," BSM is a model to attempt to formalize the components of an options price. It is not the only way to price an option, but given that the industry has pretty much adopted it as the standard, if you use a model substantially different, you're not going to be able to play well with others. As such, it's good to use as a base. When you trade stock you're literally taking a position on a topic (""I think this stock should be higher"") -- that the market is wrong on the price. That you think the price should be higher (or lower in the case of shorting) than it is. When you trade options you need to think like that, but to get started, think in terms of IV instead of price.

You mention how to calculate (implied) volatility. I think you need to separate volatility out in to a few components:

* Historic volatility
* Implied volatility
* Future (realized) volatility
* Your model's volatility

Historic volatility: You look at the price moves over whatever period of time you're interested in (30 days for example). If you assume volatility is mean reverting -- that it will remain close to what it was in some specific historic time period like the past 30 days, then you can effectively calculate a price of what volatility ""should"" be based on historic. In this way you should think of historic volatility as an input to a pricing model.

Implied volatility: Imagine someone else, lets call them MM, has come up with a price for an option, but you want to solve the equation (think in reverse) to figure out what volatility they used as an input. In other words, the current option price *implies* that the volatility is the this. Yet another way to think of it, ""the option price would make sense if the volatility were X"" and X = IV.

Future (realized) volatility: This is what the actual volatility ends up being in the future (after you open your position). You have a scenario where you try to determine what you think volatility should be and you assume it is mean reverting to the historic volatility, so you calculated what this is and called it HV, you take the current options price and calculate what the options market is pricing volatility as and call it IV. You then say HV < IV so I should short IV as it will mean revert. So you short IV, then at the end of the week your options expire (because why think long term) you find that the realized volatility of that stock was >> IV and you post your loss porn.

Your model's volatility: This is how you (attempt) to make money. Develop your own volatility model. You don't think volatility is going to revert to the historic 30 day mean volatility? Great, come up with a better way to predict what future volatility will be. You think it should be based on how many ads you see for a particular product? Great, add that in to your volatility model. Think it's going to be based on whether or not people are going to freak out once the governments acknowledge that they've been letting extra terrestrials come and alien roofie us? Excellent, come up with a way to quantify our collective reptilian caused gaping assholes and put that in to your model. Once you have your model for volatility, compare it against IV and take an appropriate position.

If you literally use IV as though it was your model's IV like all of these ""potential of profit"" or ""why is it that when I do the expected value calculations with IV it ends up showing a 0 expected value assuming mid point fills"" booger artists, then you're missing the point. IV is calculated from the fucking option price you uncontrollably rocking in your chair retard. I realize we're not all high functioning autists, but ffs it's even in the name -- it's the volatility *implied* by the options price.

tldr; short IV because betting against IV works long term (assuming you have infinite capital). Qualifications: I was sitting on 1k shares of GME for a couple years and sold it before the price rocketed. Also this isn't financial advice. Don't listen to me.
