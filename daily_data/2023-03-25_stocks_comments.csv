Sure they bailed out wealthy VC depositors at SVB, but you can't assume they'd do the same if your small bank went under. In fact, they've made it clear that they will only protect depositors if they deem your bank systematically important. They basically told everyone to abandon ship at regional banks.

33,VERY," Powell will only hold the line if inflation doesn’t come down to 2%. The bet isn’t on Powell’s truth telling abilities. It’s on whether inflation will stay elevated going into the summer.

The reason rate cuts have become more solidified in the minds of markets is because a credit crunch from the banking crisis is on its way, which is going to tighten financial conditions *significantly.* I don’t think any of us are really taking into account just how much of a brake slam a credit crunch is within a country that runs entirely on credit. The most ominous sign is that the yield curve is beginning to disinvert, indicating that the recession is right on the cusp of beginning. Yield curve has always begun its return to normal levels, a few months before the recession begins.

There’s also the fact that Powell said with a massive degree of certainty, in 2021, that he forecasted 2, maybe 3 rate hikes in 22. How’d that work out. The Fed’s rhetoric and its eventual course of action, are two VERY different things.

Either way, I wouldn’t recommend relying on this sub for advice at all.

Spending decreases. People who were suppose to work as tech at those small companies are SOL. Decrease spending.  
We got bank failures. Government gives money to bank to pay depositors.  Means more inflationary pressure. Inflation means everything will cost more.  Wage isn't going up as fast as Inflation.  We get to a point when people can't save money anymore and start withdrawing from saving account take credit card debt and sell stocks etc. To make ends meet.  Then spending decrease.  
We got war in Europe We got war threatening to start in Asia.  We know why war is bad. 
We just got rate increase after bank failure.  Means Inflation is worse than We think.

44,BIG," If the cause is falling inflation then yes that may be ok although I think they may prefer to pause for six to twelve months to let things even out a bit. I’m in real estate and even though we are still crazy busy, lower rates would be great for my business. 

My comments are based on the assumption that the only way they are cutting this year is due to bank troubles. BIG bank troubles.

AI is already overhyped, if you are trying to make money off of the innovation of AI don’t buy an AI company. Buy companies that you think will be able to reduce their costs due to the innovation or buy companies who make hardware that will be needed for more powerful computing, but not the ones directly mentioning AI like NVDA. Most of those companies you have missed the biggest part of the hype train.

48,AI," I asked ChatGPT lol mind you its knowledge cutoff is September 2021: 

“As an AI language model, I am unable to provide specific investment advice or recommendations. It is always important to do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

However, if you are interested in investing in companies that are involved in the AI industry, here are a few things you could consider:

Look for established tech companies that are investing heavily in AI research and development, such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.

Consider investing in companies that are using AI to disrupt traditional industries, such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. 
Some examples include Intuitive Surgical (healthcare), Square (finance), and Tesla (transportation).

Look into companies that specialize in providing AI services or products, such as NVIDIA (graphics processing units for AI), Palantir (data analytics), and Cognizant (consulting and outsourcing services).

Keep in mind that investing in stocks carries risks, and the value of your investments can go up or down. It's important to do your own research and make informed decisions.”",Sugo_Huavo,12,/r/stocks/comments/121rinc/if_ai_is_the_next_big_industry_where_to_put_510/jdn92i1/,0.011,0.917,0.072,0.8442

For example, Adobe will probably use AI tech in their software. Will that make them more money? Sure. Will it increase their stock? Who knows. Microsoft already bought chatgpt I think.

159,AI," I’m not “very wrong” because I’m not talking about jobs. Sure it will replace a lot of jobs and it will enhance others. Will it innovate anything more ? Nope. Its replacing incompetence and improving organizational needs. Since we’re talking about stock value AI does not have much to offer. Its a great big buzzword right now.

Innovation drives the economy. A successful product is essentially a “problem” solved because a demand existed for that type of item or idea. The “problem” present is that it takes too long to find certain data. 

You can not sit here and state AI will improve innovation for what its worth because of the simple fact every line was hard coded by a human. Most of our current “problems” in society have been innovated. The “innovation” in AI is the fact that we can now access already existing data better. It enables organization and search that humans otherwise were incompetent for or took too much time. 

I can now search and summarize certain data much quicker than having to sift through several links and libraries of information. Great!

162,AI," Yeah and that was the lesson learned from the dot com bust. Something can be totally world changing and also end up being totally overhyped because these companies in their infancy have money thrown at them and are told to fill massive shoes. 

Cisco literally built the internet. They invented the modern modem/routers. Truly they were groundbreaking. They also fell 83% after the bubble popped and never would see the bubble highs again. They did become a decent dividend stock in the past ten years but it’s safe to say buying the hype would have been a mediocre investment at best. 

There are plenty of other .coms that were 100% hype that you no longer even recognize the names of, and it was just as hard as it is today to pick a winner.

163,MSFT," Yeah and that was the lesson learned from the dot com bust. Something can be totally world changing and also end up being totally overhyped because these companies in their infancy have money thrown at them and are told to fill massive shoes. 

Cisco literally built the internet. They invented the modern modem/routers. Truly they were groundbreaking. They also fell 83% after the bubble popped and never would see the bubble highs again. They did become a decent dividend stock in the past ten years but it’s safe to say buying the hype would have been a mediocre investment at best. 

There are plenty of other .coms that were 100% hype that you no longer even recognize the names of, and it was just as hard as it is today to pick a winner.

183,AI," I lost money in college too but those losses prepared me for investing later in life and I far made back what I lost over time.

Have an investment strategy. What is a company worth? Why are you investing in it? I sold stock in companies such as ServiceNow because they exceeded my valuation and I didn’t see how they were worth the price unless an acquirer paid a crazy premium. I lost out on some upside but was able to redeploy the money in stocks which I thought had better valuations. It’s impossible to time so you have to stick with your viewpoint unless a condition of your assumption changes.

Also pay attention to the macroeconomic conditions. As the pandemic started, I threw a lot of money into Amazon and Target because everyone was going to be staying at home and having limited retail options. As the pandemic was coming to an end, I sold. Places opening up meant they were unlikely to retain their share.

I would sell Nvidia at this price because it’s rising on the AI hype. It could be worth the price but it’s priced based on future growth. I would use your gains there to offset sales of the companies that may never recover: penny stock, others that you don’t believe will be more profitable at this point in the long run. But that's up to you to decide based on your investment strategy.

And even with an investment strategy, there will be losers. I love pipeline companies because they set contracts that are paid regardless of the volume and environmental challenges make it really hard to build new pipelines. However, when the oil industry struggled, the oil companies went bankrupt and the pipeline companies lost those guaranteed customers. I didn't fully take into consideration how the macroeconomic environment could impact a broader group and trickle down into the system.

Make sure to pay attention to how you’ll harvest the tax losses if you sell low. You can deduct up to $3K of capital losses (after offsetting any capital gains), and carry over losses to future tax years. If you are selling at a loss, those carryover losses can help reduce tax burdens in future years from gains or from immediate gains that year.

If you don’t have time to pay attention to valuation and macroeconomic factors, use index funds and plan to hold for a long time.",jemilk,2,/r/stocks/comments/1215ll4/im_an_idiot_how_do_i_fix_my_portfolio_after/jdm55v8/,0.136,0.757,0.107,-0.9102

I stopped last week at 90 shares of AAPL (35 were bought when it was only $130/ share but I bought more at $160 because I dont want to bet that they will go back down to $130). I’m done for now though given the talk of a looming recession. I only have 5 shares of TSLA, because I bought at $135 as an experiment and now don’t want to pay the higher price, but I wish I had bought more. I’d like maybe 50 shares total. I did not know it was a trough though. We only see the peaks and troughs looking back, right? 

My plan is to keep cash in my brokerage savings account which pays 3.5% interest, then buy more AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, AMD, NVDA, TSM, AMZN, TSLA and others if they go “on sale” during a recession. I’m waiting for the sale, but holding what I have, even if/when they go red. 

I’m holding everything for a long time though.

I would keep anything paying a dividend, and TSLA, AMZN, GOOGL. Actually I would keep them all. Some or most  will probably grow in 10-50 years. Just leave it alone. They might go down further if we hit a recession. Don’t look at the loss, just keep in mind that you own “x shares of ABC stock”, which may eventually be worth more several years/decades from now.

235,GOOG," I lump-summed into the market around October/November 2021. Quite possibly the worst time to do such a thing in the last 4 or 5 years. During 2022, my portfolio was devastated. I think at one point I may have been down 65 percent overall.

Now, my portfolio is starting to rally back. GOOG and NVDA are my two biggest holdings. I doubled down on GOOG in the low 90's, but didn't add more NVDA, sadly. However, those two stocks are carrying my portfolio on their backs. NVDA is starting to get really close to my original entry price. GOOG is starting to slowly climb it's way back up, and because I doubled down in the low 90's, it's also not super far away from a break-even point.

My question is this. Let's say that you invested 100k in October/November 2021. At the absolute worst point of 2022, (maybe October 13th?), the 100k was only worth 45k. 

Let's say that at some point in the next 60 days, if the market doesn't crater (more so GOOG and NVDA specifically), I might be able to jump out with my original 100k.

The question is, should I just be happy that I was able to avoid disaster and get my money out, and wait around for a better entry point? Or, would this be a foolish idea, because I suffered through all the bad times, just to come out with the same amount of $$ at the end of the day. 

Instead, I should be holding on for years into the future, so that I can come out on the other side and get some dividends for my patience and ability to not cower in the corner down 65 percent overall?

Or, would it be more stock specific? For example, NVDA is out of control. Even I know this. It's run is unsustainable imo. I figure, if it gets all the way back to my cost basis (around $295), I should thank the heavens and get the hell out of Dodge. It can't just keep running and running and running. There's going to be a pullback.

I'm just pretty conflicted about the whole thing. I think the market is still going to hit a new low at some point, but I think this rally could last a bit longer before this new low happens. Another part of me thinks that maybe the worst is behind us now, and that if I sold out of everything, hoping to jump back in after a new bank failure or macro-economic threat pops up. Maybe something related to the war in Ukraine or whatever. The market tumbles again, and then I can jump back in after having all my money on the sidelines waiting for the opportunity.

I know that this would be trying to ""time the market"" again, but remember, the last time I wanted to time the market, I instead relented to the advice of everybody else, and it cost me dearly.

Then again, while I had been planning to wait for the market to crater before jumping in when I did, I would have probably entered about 7 months too soon in early to mid 2022. I wouldn't have been sitting on the sidelines till October.

240,GOOG," If you were down 65% at one point in 2022, I think there's a broader question beyond GOOG/NVDA of risk tolerance/allocation - investing is a marathon, not a sprint so the question imo becomes not getting back to even and then dumping everything it is more what does a portfolio look like that you can stick with over time. Definitely sorry that you were down that much at one point but if you were down that much that portfollio has got to be very aggressive/specuative growth and you have to consider whether that's sustainable/something you can stick with over time. 

If not, then you can look to trim some things, build a shopping list and I'd *gradually* restructure to get to a more tolerable (understandably so) risk level. You can still have growth stocks, but build in some slower growth/high quality names that will provide some buffer and maybe have the kind of portfolio that would be down more in the 25-30% range in a scenario like 2022 (which is still not fun, but is better than -65%) where you can more easily get through that will probably be a volatile market for a while.",dvdmovie1,1,/r/stocks/comments/121glsl/rstocks_weekend_discussion_saturday_mar_25_2023/jdmyls7/,0.052,0.841,0.107,0.9235

January 2023 Guardian [article](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/12/bank-of-england-completes-sale-of-19bn-emergency-bond-purchases-after-mini-budget):

> Threadneedle Street said it had completed the sale of £19.3bn of government bonds three months after it was forced to intervene in markets to halt a run on pension funds.

From a November 4th, 2022 FT [article](https://www.ft.com/content/5cb72623-2b14-4479-84b8-8679e42b1100):

> The Bank of England’s record in September’s gilts meltdown is also promising. Just two weeks of bond-buying contained the worst fallout from pensions’ forced selling and, as of Tuesday, the BoE became the only big central bank to start selling bonds. Why would the Fed fail where the BoE succeeded?

To emphasize, the Bank of England was the first major central bank to do active QT (in contrast, the Fed has been doing passive QT where it lets the long duration assets simply mature without buying more. In active QT the Bank of England directly sells the long duration assets into the market.) And this was 2 weeks after the crisis!

255,ENPH," They are definitely shifting from hardware to software. You know who else is doing that? Pretty much everyone in the space ( at least the premium ones with the resources and higher margins as a business case, instead of volume and razor thin margins ). I work for a company that has x5 the revenue of ENPH. We have inverters on the shelf, and are also looking into monetising the software services better. All that still requires the customer to have your hardware installed though. What forward PE would you value Microsoft’s XBOX division at? That model of commoditising the hardware, and monetising the software is pretty much what they do… and they do it strategically, because of their other businesses. What other business does ENPH have that will allow them to commoditise their hardware completely, and grow their service part as a SaaS pure play?

I’m not saying ENPH isn’t a good company, and that they won’t grow and potentially maintain premium margins. What I’m saying is they wont be able to do it at the scale required for these 60 forward PE projections to come true ( or rather, they will eventually come true, but that’s irrelevant right now when talking stock price and if it’s a good buy now, at these valuations ). Anyone who thinks ENPH or similar players will be able to grow revenue and maintain margins better than, let’s say someone like Salesforce or Microsoft, is delusional, or trying to sell you something.",tv2zulu,2,/r/stocks/comments/120zuw3/enphase_energy_and_why_this_could_be_a_great_time/jdlndek/,0.0,0.883,0.117,0.9753
256,ENPH," I see a fPE of 35. Where do you see 60?

The thing is, they are no where near saturation and they are, at this point, the market makers in their segment (along with SEDG). Probably not even at 30% saturation based on the roofs I see here in SoCal which has a pretty high rate of adoption.

So in other words, there is a long way to run. How long? Dunno but 10 years wouldnt be a stretch with a peak in 5 and then taper off after that. Then after thats over, it will be time to add batteries and replace the old centrals and such.

So its hard to say where they land and thus hard to say what they should be valued at. But at 35 fPE... id say this is very fair though I wouldnt go with ENPH (even though that what I currently own), id suggest SEDG.

As for shift to software; There is no shift. The software is literally what made them. They were 1st to market with a killer feature (panel isolation and related management software) and since then, no one has made anything better unless you count SEDGE as better with batteries. Everyone else copied later. Note we have had competitors for years now. They arent making a dent because no one trusts them and for the record, no one trusted ENPH nor SEDG for a few years as well. But now they do, and thats that.

Like all software environments, customers are sticky. In other words, no one is going to take their market unless they royally screw it up themselves. Whoever you work for isnt going to get anywhere in this segment. They might get a small slice with a few installers that they have deals with but the game is over here in the USA. You wont be able to build trust fast enough nor lower prices materially enough for anyone to chance it on an expensive home fixture. Maybe in other countries but there is fierce competition there as well.

The issue is similar with software environments in other spaces. It makes no difference if other can make a competitive product, end of the day, you will need to give them away for free to get people to switch and ive seen people so stubborn that they wont switch what they are comfortable with even if you give them a free product. Its just not worth their time.

So Id ask you the following questions. 1) how much cheaper are all these upstart products? 2) How easy is their support process? 3) Can you guarantee that those companies will keep supporting the product for the lifecycle of the inverters (10-15 years)?

Your answer will likely be;

1. not significantly different (maybe 5%-10% else no margins)
2. likely not as streamlined and certainly no community support
3. unknown and based on solar industry history, not good either

So its hard to say where they land and thus hard to say what they should be valued at. But at 35 fPE... id say this is very fair though I wouldnt go with ENPH (even though that what I currently own), id suggest SEDG.

As for shift to software; There is no shift. The software is literally what made them. They were 1st to market with a killer feature (panel isolation and related management software) and since then, no one has made anything better unless you count SEDGE as better with batteries. Everyone else copied later. Note we have had competitors for years now. They arent making a dent because no one trusts them and for the record, no one trusted ENPH nor SEDG for a few years as well. But now they do, and thats that.

Like all software environments, customers are sticky. In other words, no one is going to take their market unless they royally screw it up themselves. Whoever you work for isnt going to get anywhere in this segment. They might get a small slice with a few installers that they have deals with but the game is over here in the USA. You wont be able to build trust fast enough nor lower prices materially enough for anyone to chance it on an expensive home fixture. Maybe in other countries but there is fierce competition there as well.

The issue is similar with software environments in other spaces. It makes no difference if other can make a competitive product, end of the day, you will need to give them away for free to get people to switch and ive seen people so stubborn that they wont switch what they are comfortable with even if you give them a free product. Its just not worth their time.

So Id ask you the following questions. 1) how much cheaper are all these upstart products? 2) How easy is their support process? 3) Can you guarantee that those companies will keep supporting the product for the lifecycle of the inverters (10-15 years)?

Your answer will likely be;

1. not significantly different (maybe 5%-10% else no margins)
2. likely not as streamlined and certainly no community support
3. unknown and based on solar industry history, not good either

Now think about this from the perspective of installer who has to service warranties and for buyers who are spending $20k-$30k on a home fixture. Are either one going to take a chance for $500-$1000 saving?

259,AC," Its the worst setup possible. 2%-8% (depending on conditions) lost energy for literally no reason. If you go with optimizers or any central inverter setup, you immediately gain 2%-8% more production. And its not just that, but also more points of failure so likely more money spent to fix things down the line and the battery level inverters will not be cheap.

The reason is, with ENPH inverters, you have to invert two more times to make the system work. You invert at the panel (because thats literally what those micros do), then invert into the battery (no such thing as a AC battery despite Enphases false marketing innuendo), then invert out the battery for a total of 3 inversions... With any other setup you only invert once.

Is 37 fair like you say? Maybe... priced for perfection I'd say. Definitely not cheap like OP wants to make it out to be, with his moving-day-averages mumbo jumbo.

All your questions, ignore my initial points. At what cost is this scale-up going to happen? We agree that ENPH is a good company and a leader. That's not the point. The point is, is it a good investment, and what will ramp-up cost them, can they even execute on such historical large ramp-up, and how will it affect margins, and thus valuation? They might be a software company, but not without the hardware installed, and they can't just loss-lead brute force their way. Not even Sony or MS had the pockets for that with the gaming hardware. Production and cost-control for hardware needs to scale as well, no matter their software edge.

267,NIM," Here's a counterpoint from Bob Elliot on Twitter. [Read the thread here](https://twitter.com/BobEUnlimited/status/1638705766851805189), including [graphs](https://imgur.com/a/px4sXBg), but I'll reproduce it here.

**The TL;DR**: Assuming extreme charge-off rates (twice that of the 07-08, higher than Great Depression over 5 years), punitively low net interest margins [NIM] for small banks (2%), and considering the amount due this year (250B on 2T outstanding), there is still enough NIM to cover the losses. Without having to use the $700B in capital the small banks hold.

> CRE loans by small banks have gotten a lot of attention from the ‘bank crisis’ crowd so lets get sense of largest possible risk: 2tln outstanding, a 5yr x 3% charge off is 300bln. NIM to 2pct on 5tln loans yields 100bln/yr. 200bln cushion before touching 700bln of capital.
> 
> The above assumes extraordinary stress on small banks 2x worse than seen in the GFC [Global Financial Crisis] or any time in the last 40 years.  Even with that, the banks may not be great businesses but there is no crisis here.
> 
> Let’s look at the size of the loans outstanding reported by the H8. [[Graph 1]](https://i.imgur.com/ONnhJM6.png). About 2tln in total.  Fwiw lots of press about 250bln coming due this year, which seems modest vs what’s outstanding.
> 
> The let’s talk about possible loss rates.  The Fed prints these historical numbers. [[Link]](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/chargeoff/chgothersa.htm)  In the GFC these charged off at just over 2pct for 1 year.  5yr cycle charge offs closer to 1.5% per year.  **Above I assume 2x the GFC cycle**.
> 
> Then let’s talk about NIM.  Small banks have fine NIM in general and higher than the big banks.  Below by asset size.  Historically in the 3-3.5 range.  Remember as you get to small banks the higher pct that are insured deposits. Above I assume extremely punitive at 2pct. [[Graph 2]](https://i.imgur.com/VJ1xyMv.png)
> 
> And then let’s apply that to the whole 5tln loan book outstanding. [[Graph 3]](https://i.imgur.com/Gu0lYch.png) You normally get 150-200bln in NIM but let’s assume only 100 above. Even > stress tested that way there is still more than enough NIM in a terrible base to absorb an extraordinary loss rate.  And that’s before going into the 700bln in capital [[Graph 4]](https://i.imgur.com/JtRVgVZ.png)
> 
> What many folks don’t realize is that the whole banking loan process is designed to earn enough income to more than offset the losses booked even during bad periods.  The process plays out over long periods of time so there is plenty of time to earn vs the charges.
> 
> The problems come when those losses accelerate.  Like on securities where they have to be booked immediately (all that subprime rmbs) or on loans when actually default (like all the liar loans in the GFC that proactively defaulted fast).
> 
> If banks take all that immediately they go broke like the GFC.  But if they take the losses over long periods of time then they may be bad businesses but they earn out the losses.
> The nature of CRE lending is that it the loans take 5-10yrs before they come due.  That means that banks have years of earning power before the loans are likely to become a problem.
> Of course there may be some specific banks that run into issues, but this sure doesn’t look like anything close to a systemic issue even penciling in **very extreme** losses and low NIMs.
> 
> Just one more thing to add.  This level of stress test is higher than 5yrs of Great Depression level loss rates. [[Graph 5]](https://i.imgur.com/ZfMAQtp.png)  Then the levels peaked at 3.5pct and 5yr loss rates were well below 3pct on average.

278,CD," lol. I feel embarrassed calling them about 1 quantity worth 1000 USD of CD.

But I guess I should ask them.",sane_is_insane,-1,/r/stocks/comments/121si31/unable_to_exit_cd_on_td_ameritrade/jdndr39/,0.092,0.733,0.175,0.1531
279,CD," Thanks.

Yes. I actually intend to hold till maturity. But this was just an experiment to understand how they work.

At least now I know, it's difficult to sell CD mid-way even at a loss.",sane_is_insane,1,/r/stocks/comments/121si31/unable_to_exit_cd_on_td_ameritrade/jdnemzh/,0.163,0.737,0.1,-0.5267
280,USA," I thought that maybe the Fed was just wanting inflation to make the retired so poor they will have to return to work taking low-paid jobs to keep the rich getting richer. The next 20 years would be growth and prosperity for some and poverty and famine for others.

But, I guess the real reason the Fed has done so much damage since Trump is nepotism, the hiring of people who are not qualified for the job. Three percent mortgage rates, zero percent interest rates and doubling the Fed's balance sheet to about $9 trillion has done a lot of damage that we are only starting to see.

Whatever, there is no sign things are going to be corrected to help the average person in the USA. In the next 20 years there will probably be millions of people living in tents and dying on the streets in poverty and squalor, many more people who outlive their savings. Or, maybe there will be a social revolution and the USA will no longer be the global superpower. China already has more workers than the USA, and I guess more housing units as well.",AmericanSahara,2,/r/stocks/comments/121sx6b/jerome_powells_policy_errors_continue/jdncgc9/,0.112,0.811,0.077,-0.8635
