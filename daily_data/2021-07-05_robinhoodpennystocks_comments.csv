4,BLRX," I don't get attached to stocks, but have been trading BLRX with bullish bias for about a year. All signs point to promising pipeline and a good value. But it is a really manipulated stock. It's cool that they didn't do an offering after last data readout, but stock got crushed anyway. Sold the Seeking Alpha after hours pump the other day, bought back in around $3. Tuesday is a toss up IMO, but ultimately I think the upside strongly trumps the downside.",stompingllama,9,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/odx9ld/list_of_plays_for_tuesday_planning_on_buying/h437llv/,0.122,0.71,0.168,0.6663

10,BITF," I bought both HUT and BITF otc prior to the nasdaq listings. Obviously up a lot. 

HUT owns and mines more than $RIOT. They have more issued shares. I broke it down for a friend that follows my picks, after some math, as a miner stock, HUT would be worth around $25.

BITF is a smaller scale company that does the same shit, but powers it via hydroelectricity. Cuts the biggest expense of mining off the table. I suspect both to fly sooner than later.

17,BLRX," Since I followed the stock when the boards were really quiet on it, I got to know the StockTwits users who were much more knowledgeable than me on the actual science and values. I defer to them; this poster in particular: https://stocktwits.com/stealin_your_thunder I'm a paid subscriber so it's easier for me to filter by ticker, but a lot of his posts are about BLRX, so it shouldn't take too much scrolling to get to some info. They partnered with Merck on studies. Here's one particular post with good info: https://stocktwits.com/stealin_your_thunder/message/351067162. Bear in mind, HC Wainwright is a biased source with ties to the company, so I don't put much weight on the price target. But there is solid data suggesting motixafortide could become standard of care.

Here's a link to their most recent corporate presentation (PDF download) https://ir.biolinerx.com/static-files/ba147804-7758-4a28-bca2-3cc45f041325

Some of the longs were quite disappointed by the way the PR was presented May 4, feeling it didn't properly convey the positive results compared to the corporate presentation that came out afterwards.",stompingllama,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/odx9ld/list_of_plays_for_tuesday_planning_on_buying/h44z362/,0.048,0.839,0.113,0.8945
