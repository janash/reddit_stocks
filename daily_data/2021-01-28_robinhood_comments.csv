7,RH,"Robinhood. 

You guys are undermining a free market and curbing ability to trade assets when it suits you!? That's not how it works: As a broker and market maker, impartiality and objectivity is the most important characteristic. 

Presently, you're biasing the market and imposing a bearish sentiment to help out HFs who are literally tweaking the rules of trading to serve their needs, just as they have for decades. 

I'm so disappointed, you guys were supposed to represent the brokerage of the future: Silicon Valley team, good usability and lowering the barrier of entry for the average joe who wants to invest. Well, that pipedream is officially over and you're from this point forward no better than any other pin-striped suit, cigar-smoking, fat Wall St bastard who's treating the free market like their personal casino by driving companies with thousands of employees to the ground for no other reason than to profit from it.
