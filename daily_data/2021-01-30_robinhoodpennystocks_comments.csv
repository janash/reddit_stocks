8,GME," THIS IS A REPOST Credit: u/StocksAndSports

Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

🚀🚀Fidelity and Vanguard🚀🚀. You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

Take this opportunity by the balls and never let go. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

27,GME," Borrow fee has dropped from 100%+ a week ago to now 33.6%, most shorts have covered. Majority of money being made is by hedge funds and institutions not retail traders, as they are the primary shareholders. Congrats to buyers at $5-30 but retail will be the bag holder at GME $300 cost average.

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings

Borrow fee source is from looking at it constantly the past week with my broker.

Your source of 61 million I’m assuming is from here https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/

Which is outdated, that info is from Jan 15th 2021 while GME started going parabolic Jan 24th - 25th. The borrow fee was over 100% then but has since dropped, those 61 million shares have covered. Remaining short is still relatively high compared to blue chip stocks but short shares has been reduced by over 75%. You can also see GME did not go parabolic on Jan 15th when short interest was still high, most people covered during the $90-$330 move which was the only reason that insane volatility was even possible.",xxxbankai42xx,-1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/l8cnx2/an_important_correction/glcntg5/,0.02,0.921,0.059,0.7227

147,CAN," WHO ARE WE:

We are the 1MillionTradeMarch

t.me/ukchatforwallstreetbetsnews  

t.me/ukchatwallstreetbets

www.twitter.com/trade_march

Time to change the game...

We plan to mobilise the masses and strike when they least expect us.

This isn't about making or losing money, this is about showing the establishment that we hold the power and are no longer lambs to the slaughter. 

We have been pushed too far, all races, all religions, political affiliation, regardless of your income or status if you aren't one of the 1% then you are now one of us!

Time to fight back.

Spread the word!


OUR PLAN OF ATTACK:

A stock is chosen based on certain criteria, we have some of the top private trade investors on our team who do this for you.

It is selected after the market closes.

It is then released to the whole group. At 8 am GMT we begin buying that stock. Spend as much as you are willing to lose (every little helps) we collectively HOLD that stock, (this could be for weeks) the shorters then start to get charged interest-based on how high the share price goes, eventually, they are forced to close their positions they do this by BUYING shares at the current market value.

If enough people hold hold hold and buying pressure is constant this works, if people panic and sell it doesn’t work and the shorter WINS.


SIMPLE EXAMPLE:

Shorter buys a stock for £1 hoping it will go to £0.50.

The masses buy that stock and raise the price to £3 Shorter panics and buys out the position at £3 (BURNT)

Everyone then sells and the stock returns to just above £1 due to the shorter’s mass holdings pushing up the base price.

If you buy and don’t HOLD then small-time investors will get burnt it will drive the price below the £1 start figure and the Shorter WINS!


WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO:

1.       The share will be ANNOUNCED after 5 pm GMT the day before on t.me/ukchatforwallstreetbetsnews  

2.       At 8 am GMT BUY that share

3.       Hold that share no matter what for as long as it takes.

 
HOW YOU CAN HELP US:

1.       Share, Share, Share – not just on telegram, everywhere – send everyone to telegram groups: 
t.me/ukchatforwallstreetbetsnews
t.me/@ukchatwallstreetbets
www.twitter.com/trade_march

2.       Please don’t share stock ideas, please by all means if you want to discuss things great but we won’t consider any stock suggestions.

3.       Buying stocks is a risk you could lose every penny you invest so please don’t put money in you can’t afford to lose.

4.       Use a broker that charges you to trade, this will stop the “RobinHood” effect. Paid brokers need permission to sell your shares unpaid ones don’t.",adaman27,-2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/l89rbf/daily_discussion_thread/gld91io/,0.076,0.834,0.09,-0.2716

However, currently don’t have the $500 to buy the shares, so I opted to just sell the call instead. But I’m not paper handing this and I have until 2/19 so I’m only selling for $500 per share right now.

Goal: Pick a value stock that has more promise than a pump and dump. Invest at least 10% of weekly gains in it to hopefully be a 6 bagger 💰💰💰💰💰💰and pay off my hella expensive school loan. 6 month - year from now.

It is ending it’s contract with roach and will then Need to market the product with another company contract starting sunday. Not FDA approved so that’s the catalyst that may rock this up.

Anyway, screenshot shows my initial holdings and cost. I’ll try to Stick with my plan and post updates in the few weeks in this sub.

Disclosure: do your own DD and don’t seek my investment advice without such because who tf knows what happens in the future.
