But if this is all correct, how can there not be money to be had?  if someone smarter than me can explain where I am wrong, I would love to know. I am new and like I said, I didnt get in in the beginning.   


I dont think the hedge funds have learned their lessons. If you can believe the news, GME is still shorted by over 100%.   
From CNBC - 

*  **Short-selling hedge funds have suffered a mark-to-market loss of $19.75 billion year to date in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer GameStop, according to data from S3 Partners.**
* **Still, short sellers mostly are holding onto their bearish positions or they are being replaced by new hedge funds willing to bet against the stock.**
* **GameStop shares that have been borrowed and sold short have declined by just about 5 million over the last week, marking an 8% dip in the short interest, according to S3.**
* **Most of the short covering occurred on Thursday, when the stock fell for the first time in six days.**

255,SBUX," Nah, Elizabeth Warren(who i wanted for president) is righting a letter to the SEC saying its not fair. The people in the stock market benefit way more than the company's workers ever will. 

They are going to change leverage rules. Robinhood may be insolvent at this moment, you can only buy one share of SBUX for instance. Imagine how many call options expired in the money or were assigned and people couldnt cover.

They are most likely going to make companies have more money on hand to cover all these leveraged positions, which means companies will just not give us much if any leverage.

I sold my options before their presentation and then sold the stock after. Not because I don’t believe in them. But because I’m just chasing short term gains on RH. 

Part of their phase 2 Endoxifen is done but I don’t see published results. If they have really promising data that could more than double it. For reference, the company I work for had promising phase 2 and our stock went from 1$>9$ in one day. It was for more broad tumor than breast cancer but regardless that’s how much impact it can have. 

I guess I’m saying short term can happen. You’re just banking on something that doesn’t happen often in this area.

It is cheaper now than it was yesterday you can decide if it’s good to buy rn for yourself that’s my guess tho and as people transfer from robinhood or they let us buy more the price I assume would steadily increase if that happens.
