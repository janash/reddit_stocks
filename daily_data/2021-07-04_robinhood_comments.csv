0,RH," RH uses the approach of adding or removing deposits and withdrawals from your historical account value as if all of them happen on the day the account was opened. 

The biggest benefit of this is that if gives you a line that, relative to itself, moves up and down by amounts that reflect the performance of your investments and trades. 

The way most other brokers do it sucks, which is they show a $2k account that gets a $50k deposit as increasing in value by $50k on the day of the deposit which completely obscures the performance of your investment and trades before that money was deposited. Similarly withdrawals make the account value chart look like you had a huge drop in value of your positions that day. 

There are probably more advantages / disadvantages to each approach but Iâ€™ve found that after initially laughing at the RH approach I realized it solved a complaint I had about the approach other brokers took.
