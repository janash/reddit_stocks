6,GDP, Looking for a discussion/debate here. What is the bull case for the US economy? I’m bearish on the US. Our trade deficits balloon every year because we’re almost purely a consumer economy. The number 1 employer is the US Government which is only a drain on GDP. The next largest industry is the service industry. The vast resources of the US will never be exploited because of political reasons. The last bastion of US growth is tech and that employs a relatively small number of people and can easily be offshored if the tax environment becomes hostile. Which it will because the US has a massive debt to service that is not getting smaller and the number of net beneficiaries vs net contributors grows daily. I see nothing but stagflation in the US for decades to come.

To be fair, I'd argue that this has been the case since PSA testing became standard.

29,GME," > I'm sure those that have been with Tesla that long know exactly what they're investing in and the risk they're taking.

Some will.  But honestly: many will not.

The long bull market and the spectacular gains and the hype around Tesla has inevitably led to many investors that are ill-informed and/or unrealistic in their outlook about this stock.  As mentioned in the OP, a lot of people confuse a good company with not being risky, when in fact risk is so dependent on *price*.  I mean, Apple can be a great company with a wide moat and great profits and continued growth.  But if the shares were at $1000 instead of ~$135 the risk would be sky high.

Look at how many got sucked in and lost with GME.  They bought on hype, not fundamentals.  The difference is that the GME story played out very quickly.  Tesla is playing out over a much longer timeframe.  I am not saying that Tesla and GME are the same thing, but they do have one important thing in common: their value is way, way, way over what fundamentals normally tell us a stock--even a growth stock--should be at.

When the next crash comes people will be looking to sell things like Tesla ASAP before they lose all their profits.  It will fall hard and fast.  That's pretty much a given.  The more interesting thing to me is to see how well it recovers, and if a lot of people get caught out with a bullish mindset and buying the dip when it  drops 35% in one day, recovers by 25% because of the bulls/believers, and then drops another 50%.",ptwonline,17,/r/investing/comments/li6vyf/forgotten_lessons_of_2008_that_are_even_more/gn2llfz/,0.061,0.779,0.159,0.9791

32,IMO," IMO ""Cash"" is a bad benchmark when it loses value almost every single year.

If inflation averages >1% over the next 10 years and you have buy a 10 year bond at 1% yield, you will be poorer in 10 years than you are now.

Honestly my strategy right now is safe dividend yielding stocks as an alternative to bond yields. Growth stocks are becoming a bubble, trading at sky high valuations based on speculation of growth, but value stocks generally yield a higher rate than bonds. Of course, you risk dividend cuts or a decline in equity valuations, but over the long term if you're diversified or invest in companies with sustainable business models, it will likely produce a higher return than bonds.",skilliard7,1,/r/investing/comments/li6vyf/forgotten_lessons_of_2008_that_are_even_more/gn3bu2w/,0.085,0.82,0.095,0.0644
33,GME," I agree with you to a point on GME. GME originally was about looking slightly past fundamentals when the price was $5 a share. There was vision, infrastructure, the pending PS5/new XBox release that made $5 look incredibly cheap for such a company. 

 Once the price got to $40 or so, it was clearly *not* about fundamentals, and more about the short term prospects of a large singularity event.

Now? Who knows. There are some that are justifying the ""vision"" of GME going forward and making ad hoc calculations that it's ""really a $120+/sh company.""  Others believe that another singularity event will happen. 

  
All of those are possible, but until people can reasonably tell me the probabilities of these things happen, I will keep my $$ out of GME for the time being.

I’m also not representative of the general population having unfortunately lived in the higher COL areas such as Hawaii, NYC, SF, Vancouver, Seoul, and Tokyo so I’m a bit out of touch with the overall market. Seems Hawaii was on a lag during the subprime mortgage crisis which is when I lived in NYC, so my rental kept its value relatively and by the time it knew what hit it—the market indicators everywhere else was closer to normal so nothing really impacted the values there.

Interest rates are low, debt is cheap, retail cohorts have access to the market and data on their toilet that insiders wouldve had wet dreams over in the 70's.

53,AI," My thoughts (which I have already voiced in another thread a few days ago): 

When they IPO'd, I wanted to buy a fair amount, but I've already felt the IPO price was overvalued because of their employee stock options, and the unpublished numbers. Anyway, the stock climbed quickly and then jumped to heights (after positive ratings and HFs jumping in) that left me puzzled. At the current prices I'm definitely not investing, and here's why:

First of all, I've read comments from ""investors"" about PLTR that make me cringe (""they're gonna be the next Facebook""). I'm not sure what the average PLTR holder thinks PLTR actually does. They probably think it's gonna be something like the FAAMG stocks, on the magnitude of a technological base layer or something. I also expect that due to this misconception, a lot of RobinHood traders in their teenage years are chasing the bucks here, similar to TSLA and virtually all other tech IPOs lately. Also, it doesn't help that PLTR does something with ""AI"" (you know the saying ""If it's AI, it's written in Powerpoint, if it's Machine Learning, it's written in Python"").

In my point of view, what business is PLTR in? It's **CONSULTING**. It's not selling an AI platform to customers as a simple box, enabling the customer to do whatever they want with it. It's not a SaaS solution with a Web shop where you can buy licenses and the company can automate everything around it. Creating solutions here is very use case specific, requires a lot of project management work and most importantly, **is NOT scalable**. Also, selling to government agencies might be a plus (you can close very large contracts), but also a pain, because there are 100s of companies that ride the AI hype train and just fail to make the customers understand what real-life pain their product actually solves. It's nice to show fancy dashboards, but for most customers, they are wondering why they should spend money on it and what problem it solves.

The secrecy about PLTR does not help - never seen any concrete product in action and expect there is no scalable product yet. I assume all of it needs to be heavily customized, in painful projects that probably run like switching a business to SAP.

On a plus side, of course one could say, probably in the end it might turn out to work like SAP, which is a huge business. Provide the tech and let others do the consulting work. But they are not there yet, it's just that ""AI"" hype train.

And another argument against PLTR: there's one company who invested a lot into ""AI"" (ML) from the beginning, has a lot of tech here, but - as far as I see it - fails to gain significant traction. They do nice fancy events showcasing their AI stuff, but everytime I'm there I'm not actually seeing something palpable, they lose projects to smaller startups, or even fail to deliver at tremendous project costs. Do you know the company? It's IBM with their Watson stuff. And where is the IBM stock at the moment? Far from an all-time high as the FAAMGs. Hmmm...

Last but not least, I know people who DD'd PLTR not as an investor, but as potential employees, eventually declining job offers, as they told me the company made a chaotic impression.

But it would be a pretty easy non-investing decision if we wouldn't live in the world we live in. All of the above considerations (and of course I might be completely wrong about it) do not really matter as long as everybody else doesn't care about the true aspects of the businesses they invest in, and just invest because hey, it's AI and a silicon valley tech company with Peter Thiel as a co-founder, and everybody knows the stock must explode because everybody else will suffer from FOMO. And same as with the ridiculously inflated value of TSLA, in the end everyone investing into PLTR when it was around $ 10 was absolutely right so far. But if nothing significantly changes about that business, I think such an overinflated valuation is not sustainable.

To me, PLTR stays a true **gambling stock** that can explode or implode not based on any fundamentals, but based on pure market sentiment, FOMO, HFs driving the price due to their investments, and ratings from rating agencies people who are good at creating Powerpoints but don't know how machine learning works, and also have never sold any enterprise IT solutions themselves in their life.",git_und_slotermeyer,8,/r/investing/comments/lih6ee/full_diligence_post_on_palantir_pltr_earnings/gn3fk2z/,0.088,0.814,0.098,0.7005

When they IPO'd, I wanted to buy a fair amount, but I've already felt the IPO price was overvalued because of their employee stock options, and the unpublished numbers. Anyway, the stock climbed quickly and then jumped to heights (after positive ratings and HFs jumping in) that left me puzzled. At the current prices I'm definitely not investing, and here's why:

First of all, I've read comments from ""investors"" about PLTR that make me cringe (""they're gonna be the next Facebook""). I'm not sure what the average PLTR holder thinks PLTR actually does. They probably think it's gonna be something like the FAAMG stocks, on the magnitude of a technological base layer or something. I also expect that due to this misconception, a lot of RobinHood traders in their teenage years are chasing the bucks here, similar to TSLA and virtually all other tech IPOs lately. Also, it doesn't help that PLTR does something with ""AI"" (you know the saying ""If it's AI, it's written in Powerpoint, if it's Machine Learning, it's written in Python"").

In my point of view, what business is PLTR in? It's **CONSULTING**. It's not selling an AI platform to customers as a simple box, enabling the customer to do whatever they want with it. It's not a SaaS solution with a Web shop where you can buy licenses and the company can automate everything around it. Creating solutions here is very use case specific, requires a lot of project management work and most importantly, **is NOT scalable**. Also, selling to government agencies might be a plus (you can close very large contracts), but also a pain, because there are 100s of companies that ride the AI hype train and just fail to make the customers understand what real-life pain their product actually solves. It's nice to show fancy dashboards, but for most customers, they are wondering why they should spend money on it and what problem it solves.

The secrecy about PLTR does not help - never seen any concrete product in action and expect there is no scalable product yet. I assume all of it needs to be heavily customized, in painful projects that probably run like switching a business to SAP.

On a plus side, of course one could say, probably in the end it might turn out to work like SAP, which is a huge business. Provide the tech and let others do the consulting work. But they are not there yet, it's just that ""AI"" hype train.

And another argument against PLTR: there's one company who invested a lot into ""AI"" (ML) from the beginning, has a lot of tech here, but - as far as I see it - fails to gain significant traction. They do nice fancy events showcasing their AI stuff, but everytime I'm there I'm not actually seeing something palpable, they lose projects to smaller startups, or even fail to deliver at tremendous project costs. Do you know the company? It's IBM with their Watson stuff. And where is the IBM stock at the moment? Far from an all-time high as the FAAMGs. Hmmm...

Last but not least, I know people who DD'd PLTR not as an investor, but as potential employees, eventually declining job offers, as they told me the company made a chaotic impression.

But it would be a pretty easy non-investing decision if we wouldn't live in the world we live in. All of the above considerations (and of course I might be completely wrong about it) do not really matter as long as everybody else doesn't care about the true aspects of the businesses they invest in, and just invest because hey, it's AI and a silicon valley tech company with Peter Thiel as a co-founder, and everybody knows the stock must explode because everybody else will suffer from FOMO. And same as with the ridiculously inflated value of TSLA, in the end everyone investing into PLTR when it was around $ 10 was absolutely right so far. But if nothing significantly changes about that business, I think such an overinflated valuation is not sustainable.

To me, PLTR stays a true **gambling stock** that can explode or implode not based on any fundamentals, but based on pure market sentiment, FOMO, HFs driving the price due to their investments, and ratings from rating agencies people who are good at creating Powerpoints but don't know how machine learning works, and also have never sold any enterprise IT solutions themselves in their life.",git_und_slotermeyer,8,/r/investing/comments/lih6ee/full_diligence_post_on_palantir_pltr_earnings/gn3fk2z/,0.088,0.814,0.098,0.7005

113,EV," I'm uncomfortable investing in shipping, because the incredibly dirty nature of the fuel makes it possible, even probable, that air pollution regulations will impact their margins. They're vulnerable to price swings in fuel and carbon taxes. Something like 3% of all global CO2 emissions come down to ships burning bunker fuel. Even with recent improvements on sulfur emissions, it's not great.

There's the distinct possibility that EV booms could make fuel more expensive by a) eating away at economies of scale and b) making it more politically palatable to tax carbon.",arrbos,1,/r/investing/comments/li4uaz/castor_maritime_ctrm_to_buy_two_lr2_tankers_for/gn2s7ao/,0.107,0.818,0.075,-0.512

148,DVD," There's many reasons for me. Someone else summarized it well:

""The issue does not start with the solid state battery claims. It goes back to Fisker's original claims that he had a graphene supercapacitor, patented, with a patented machine to make graphene for ten cents a gram instead of a dollar. No, he did not have such patents and the machine was literally a DVD burner. Then he claimed that these supercapacitors were already in production at an undisclosed location. Then they were delayed but Fisker said they were still working on them. Then he parted ways with Jack Kavanaugh, his ""nanotech expert"" who was actually just a retired dentist and scam artist. And the two actual scientists showed up a month ago with what they are actually working on now: hydrogen production.

But suddenly Fisker has solid state battery technology...only his claimed timeline that the inventor contacted him a year ago, while Fisker was publicly claiming to already have supercapacitors in production, makes zero sense. And of course it makes no sense at all even if Fisker lacked a battery breakthrough at the time, but it especially makes no sense to go to a little start up with no money whose one asset appears to be great battery tech and try to sell them your new battery tech.

To summarize: Fisker is either a compulsive liar, a gullible fool readily taken in by stories about batteries, or both. He is also the last human alive who will ever be given the massive amounts of money needed to start a new EV company. So this company really does not exist, it is a fantasy.""",Horji,1,/r/investing/comments/li2o55/fsr_60_potential_gain_27_pt_morgan_stanley_dd/gn38pjf/,0.096,0.839,0.064,-0.8847

150,IMO," ""However, I am constantly in fear that we are living in a bubble are now researching timing to when to sell.""

For most of the last half decade, there has been a substantial portion of this sub that has been *convinced* that a market crash is imminent and many examples of people ""selling everything"" because they were sure that some event would inevitably cause a market crash (seen most recently with the election, where the market instead ramped after.)

It's only after people saw how well growth did and started chasing performance last Fall after funds like Ark were already up 100% for the year that this sub really changed from years of index funds and chasing dividend yield to a common topic is ""How many Ark funds do you own?"" In the span of months this sub went from one extreme (how many threads about ATT and the dividend? Seemingly countless) to the other (""How many ulta-aggressive growth Ark funds do you own?"")

Markets can absolutely get overheated/ahead of themselves but the mentality seems to be ""all in"" or ""market crash"" - there can be corrections/rotations and a market correction would be healthy but that does not mean ""market crash""

People invest a lot today it seems like with one foot constantly out the door thinking that a market crash is around every corner. It's not a good way to invest IMO. You can certainly be cautious, trim some (if everyone is piling in, trim a little and say ""sold to you"", strength continues and sell a bit more and build up a bit of cash and wait for a better opportunity) and/or decide just not to add anymore for a while. This sort of ""someone said bubble, should I sell everything?"" stuff I think just leads to frustration and wholesale market timing, which often doesn't go well. 

There's people who sold before the March 2020 decline and then in the midst of the decline, didn't buy because they were certain that the market was going lower. Again, totally fine to be cautious - trim a little into strength and gradually raise some cash, don't just add more and more, etc - but I just think people come to the conclusion of ""sell everything!"" too easily and too often it seems like. Sell everything and be wrong, now you're going to likely have FOMO and chase. Sell everything and be right and now you have a major decision as to plan when/how you're going to get back in - and if you're right, now the concerns that caused you to sell may lead you to be skeptical about putting it back in.

Basically, gradually trim some into an overbought market/into strength, don't scramble to trim once weakness has already started. Don't try to create too many decisions (especially major decisions) for yourself. If you trim some into strength in an overbought market and build up some cash, that's an easily manageable situation where it's a smaller amount of money (so if you're wrong and the market continues to ramp, you're not going to have that major FOMO that you would if you sold everything and it continued) and the decision making process is not going to feel as urgent.

I think people should largely focus on the long-term and you don't want to micromanage. People say ""let your money work for you"" - if you're constantly looking over its shoulder (checking your stocks every 5 minutes, churning your account) you're going to have issues and it's likely eventually going to cause stress.",dvdmovie1,19,/r/investing/comments/liauyb/good_sources_for_bubble_discussions/gn2auls/,0.081,0.823,0.095,0.8413

154,NAT," Tanker companies' dividend policies are very different from what most Americans are used to.  The typical American large-cap company tries to maintain a stable but growing dividend.  Tanker companies like NAT basically distribute most of their free cash flow to shareholders as dividends.

What that means is that if you have a good year when charter rates are high, you get a good dividend like in 2020.  But if you have a bad year when charter rates are low or maintenance is high, you get a small dividend.

Right now, the 1-year time charter on a Suezmax is $16,000/day.  I didn't go through all their filings, but in their last 6-F, they reported realized charter rates of $25,000/day in Q3 2020.  So 2021 is a weaker market environment by comparison.

Vessel scrapping was very low last year due to strong charter rates, so vessel supply is still strong.  So unless something changes in the vessel market, 2021 is looking like profits will be lower than last year.",Astronomer_Soft,14,/r/investing/comments/lhxf4e/nat_dd_why_im_invested_long_term/gn061ek/,0.086,0.719,0.195,0.9705

It's got better fundamentals, which don't always impress this crowd. The management team is phenomenal. They build Bema Gold to over $4B market cap and sold to Kinross. Then started B2 (Bema 2). They're crushing other gold miners. **Just look at the table below**.

If they keep up the pace, and there's no reason they can't with this management team, they will be near $2B in revenue, with nearly $600M in after tax income. Oh yeah, they pay a dividend which has increased substantially over the past 2 years, and currently sits just over 3.15%. The dividend must be a drain on cash no? Nope, the payout ration is just over 13%.

You need a catalyst, right, I forgot. Earnings are coming (Feb 23) and B2 is 50% off it's 52 week high.

Even Motley Fool knows the potential of $BTG.

I have been investing for about 2 years. I have maxed out my LISA and pay into a pension. I make 35k a year.

I have made some decent profits but I know its due to a bull market and not my stock picking skills. I took all my money out 4 days ago as markets are behaving irrationally and not based on fundamentals.

I bought back into the market 2 days ago as I would rather be out than in and I made the rookie mistake of not cost-averaging. I am now down 8%

204,AIR," AIR NZ to issue new shares- but govt is buying.
Need some opinions please. 

My local airline (AIR NZ) has been suffering through covid. To raise capital they are issuing new shares that will be purchased by the government.

Its basically a bail out, with the government taking a larger ownership of the company than it already has (like 54% already)

Question: By holding, am I likely to lose value due to the increased number of shares

Or gain money due to the large government $$$ flowing into the airline ?

Thanks!

Obviously always do your own research but filtering out the bad would be useful for saving time.

For example some of the things I notice:

1. car-salesman-tactics: trying to induce Fomo and stuff like that. Also used in piramid schemes.

2. No sources, goes by rumors.

I have student loan debt that defaulted because I could not afford to pay it at the time. So now I’m around -100,000. I really don’t believe I should have to pay it back, these loans were predatory and they still are and I don’t know why the US government is letting this happen in the first place. 

I don’t need this money that I am trying to make any time soon, but want to have a million by the time I’m 40. 

My risk tolerance is pretty high now. I’m pretty screwed as it is, so what’s a couple more thousands when my escape plan is just to move to Mexico anyway. 

I started to throw my money into stocks.... like 90% of my earnings. I was saving up to open a hot dog business and that will take about 20,000. I figured after looking at a bunch of YouTube videos that having my money sit in the bank is just loosing money. When I look at what I have invested I have around 40% gains of what I put in. I kind of just throw my money at companies I like and or in companies that work in arias that I predict will make a lot of profit in the future. I even got a crap load of DOG coin.

I still plan to put more money in some stocks. But don’t really know what I am doing, but so far I am making profit. I have stopped buying things and spending money on things and instead just throw it all in investments.

Just a short story on why I started. Watched YouTube investors and how to make money videos and that got me interested. Also this new job I managed to get in 2020 at the start of the pandemic has made me make more money then I have ever made. This made me want to just buy anything and everything that I wanted.

I’d rather be busting ass for myself working a hotdog business to support myself and do it the way I want to do it and treat workers how I wish I was treated working for others.

223,GME,"  

Hey guys, I am kinda new to trading. Of course, I know some of the basics, etc, but I mostly trade cryptos long-term (successfully) so I am not very experienced in day trading.

I am a student and used 1000 Euros (it is money which I can lose, which won't hurt me, kinda like money to play with.) but only invested 800.

I jumped on the wsb train and got burned with GME (only 2 stocks at least). I ended up at 620 and sold 1. The other one I am still holding.

Then I put money in cannabis and went up and nearly caught all my GME losses but yesterday it crashed.

So my question is, my current positions are:

Aphria: 10 shares @ 24.20 euros currently at 14.34  
Sundial Growers: 67 shares @ 2.39 euros currently at 1.99  
Tilray: 2 shares @ 42.90 euros currently at 27.50  
GameStop: 1 share @ 110 euros currently at 41.41  
THC Biomed: 200 shares @ 0.188 currently at 0.119  
The Green Org.Dutch: 19 shares @ 0.466 currently at 0.299

All in all, if I sell everything with losses now I will end up at 430.66 euros.  
Was that GME 2.0?

What would you recommend? Should I hold? Should I sell and use the 430 for other shares?  
I am interested in some sort of day trading and I would be interested in options, but since I live in Germany it is not that easy to trade with real options because the fees are sometimes really high.

Lastly, I do not ruin myself with the 1k. It is money I can lose so don't worry I end up being broke.  
I am just interested in some sort of day trading and would like your opinion if I should sell and start new or if I should hold the stocks. And I learned, never buy something which is on the front page of wsb

226,MSFT," Are protective puts a sensible hedging strategy? 

I'm currently holding a good chunk of MSFT (100% of my portfolio) and want to hedge against the risk of sudden price plunges. I know the simplest strategy is to sell and buy into index and mutual funds to diversify, but I'd like to keep a lion's share of MSFT where possible because its historic performance (when averaged over 1, 5 and 10 years) seems to out-perform most indexes. I'd also like to save on any capital gains tax expenditures where possible.

Are [protective puts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marriedput.asp) a good strategy here? According to Investopedia, they ""might work well for low-volatility stocks where investors are worried about a surprise announcement that would drastically change the price"". This seems to describe my use case pretty well, but I just want to verify from more experienced investors that I'm not falling for any kind of selection bias here.

I know the big downside is the premiums, but I'm happy to expend some capital if it protects against major losses whilst also guaranteeing a high potential yield. I know some people also write covered calls to offset the premiums, but that's a different conversation. I'm relatively new to investing so would appreciate any overall hedging advice.",hohner_,1,/r/investing/comments/li82a3/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gn1v953/,0.051,0.732,0.217,0.9901

248,ABC," I have a shorting question.  

I understand that the IRS does not allow shorting against a box for tax purposes (avoiding capital gains), but how about if the position you own has a loss?

Example: (not considering fees for simplicity sake)

You bought ABC for $10 a share 1 month ago. 

Current price is $8.

You expect prices to keep going down before coming back up.

You short ABC at market, and you pocket $8 for the time being.

ABC keeps going down and you buy to cover at $5.   

You profit $3 ($8 - $5)

QUESTION 1:

Assuming that this is OK since it had nothing to do with my tax lot that I bought at $10, and there is no deferred capital gains?

QUESTION 2:

Same scenario, but instead of ABC going down after the short, it turns and goes up to $40.

Pocketed: $8 from short

*buy back option 1:*

Must buy back at $40 

Loss: $8 - $40 = -$32

*buy back option 2:*

since you already own ABC at $10 you use that lot to cover

Loss: $8 - $10 = -$2

*buy back option 3:*

Sell the original lot at $40

Short term cap gain: $40 - $10 = $30

buy to cover @ $40

$30 - $40 = -$10

So in any of these cases, it feels like by hedging the short with your own shares you are limiting your loss exposure?  Kind of like options?

Firstly, are my calculations and assumptions completely off base? If they are correct, is this even legal?  Since its a short term capital loss, the IRS shouldn't care as much right?",dudegivemeabreak,1,/r/investing/comments/li82a3/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gn2yzfr/,0.076,0.81,0.114,0.9167

**ME:**

30, stable job, zero debt/mortgage/kids

Brokerage - Vanguard

Portfolio Intent - Long Term: \~30 years - Retirement

|:-|:-|
|VTI|40%|
|ICLN|10%|
|HYFM|10%|
|ROBO|10%|
|VNQ|5%|
|DIS|5%|

Overall, I think renewables (ICLN), controlled environment ag (HYFM), and automation (ROBO) are the way of the future. VNQ and DIS for diversity.

1. Thoughts on VOO vs. VTI? They seemed very similar but it seems VTI is cheaper and has performed better historically.
2. I was also interested in ARKQ, as I like the exposure to Alphabet, but was worried there would be too much overlap. Perhaps incorporating QQQ instead is a good idea?
3. I haven't really looked into bonds, though I have seen recommendations for a 90/10 or 80/20 stock/bond allocation. Is that a mistake?

I sold all of these shares on February 2nd at the bottom of the market on that date (I know, bad move) at .86 cents a share for a total of $811.63.  A gain of $65.24.  

I decided to jump back in at 1.52 (65 shares, 98.77 total capital back in) on February 10th.  

But, curiously, my average is now sitting at 2.47.    Is this because there was a loss on the 34 shares that I purchase at 2.68?  

I'm just having a hard time with the math to get to that 2.47 average.  Anyone have any insight?  What is the formula used to reach that 2.47 average ?

275,IMO," I have no idea what weed stocks will do in the coming days but the concern I have is that the portfolio is all chasing get rich quick plays.

Amazon's Jeff Bezos once asked Warren Buffett why more people haven't copied him over the years and Buffett said, ""Because nobody wants to get rich slow.”

IMO, people should have some portion of their portfolio dedicated to stability/consistency (and that doesn't have to be something boring like Coke, it can be a Nike, for example - not recommending Nike, just using that as an example), some portion of their portfolio dedicated to more speculative growth (a Square - not recommending that, just using as an example) and then there can be a very small portion of the portfolio dedicated to more risky bets - but those more risky bets should be something that you really have studied, feel strongly about and feel that you're getting in early on. What % is devoted to each is up to you, but that kind of structure is something that's a more sustainable way to invest over time.

Have an approach that you can stick with over time. If your whole portfolio is risky bets, you can lose a lot and be back to square one trying to build up again. If you're just trying to hit home runs every time at bat, you're going to strike out and maybe a bunch. If you get singles, doubles and the occasional triple, you're going to hopefully gradually/consistently build up the portfolio over time.",dvdmovie1,2,/r/investing/comments/li82a3/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gn1ss8b/,0.062,0.788,0.15,0.9824
276,ETN," ""Kevin O'Leary talking about why he only invests in Dividend stocks""

He also invested in Tesla.

Dividend investing is fine, but what I really do not at all agree with is when dividends/what something yields is prioritized over fundamentals. For a long time on here, people were buying things like mREITs for no reason beyond ""OMG LOOK AT THE DIVIDEND"", then March 2020 happens and people who chased yield into things like a 2x leveraged mREIT ETN (sadly, people chased that because leverage and giant yield %) lose nearly everything when the ETN craters and then gets a redemption from the issuer after it has lost something like 95% of its value. (https://www.wsj.com/articles/bankrupt-in-just-two-weeksindividual-investors-get-burned-by-collapse-of-complex-securities-11591020059.)

I'm for dividend growth (company that has strong fundamentals and a small dividend, but those strong fundamentals will likely offer an appealing mix of dividends + share price appreciation in the years ahead + dividend growth over time), definitely not going to recommend yield chasing. It's like investing in anything else - you should still look for high quality companies - a high dividend doesn't make up for something being mediocre or outright terrible.",dvdmovie1,4,/r/investing/comments/li82a3/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gn1y7hu/,0.092,0.709,0.199,0.9767

Unless you invested in stocks like Amazon and Tesla, the individual stocks may have had moderate growth.

299,CMLF," > I like ARK but I’m afraid it could be at a peak right now?

Looking long-term Ark could do very well.  Short-term, when I see investors calling Cathie Wood ""Money Tree"" (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/cathie-wood-amasses-50-billion-and-a-new-nickname-money-tree) and Ark buying something results in a massive amount of buying (and I'm currently benefiting from this owning life science spac CMLF up another 20% pre-market after Ark bought yesterday after it was up something like 50% a couple of days ago after the deal was announced) the level of hype/""everyone on one side of the boat"" is concerning. 

Ark could continue to do well (people chasing performance and money keeps pouring into Ark; Ark buys something and people pile into whatever they see Ark is buying every day, which pushes those names higher which results in continued strong performance and more money flowing in - the flywheel keeps spinning, but people have to keep in mind it can also spin the other way.) If Ark style aggressive/disruptive growth had a significant correction, it would be healthy. This sort of continual pile in and now people throwing money at whatever they see Ark buying every day (Ark posts its trades every day) can go on longer than I could imagine (and has) but I still don't think it's sustainable.

Funds up 100%+ in a year (which is fairly rare over time) also generally don't fare as well in the years after (https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1017292/what-to-expect-from-funds-after-they-gain-100-or-more-in-a-year-trouble-mostly), although perhaps Ark will be different. 

She's predicting: ""Wood said she’s confident her investments will return at least 20% annually, more than doubling over the next five years."" (https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2020/12/21/takeover-battle-subsides-as-cathie-woods-ark-targets-20-etf-returns/)  She's said there will be definite corrections/pullbacks, too - but saying 20% annually is still quite a goal/prediction after a rare kind of year for growth in 2020.

I am certainly not against investing in aggressive/disruptive growth by any means, but the hype around disruptive/aggressive growth themes right now is considerable. This sub went from focused on index funds and conservative dividend stocks to  hyper-aggressive Ark funds (and people putting 100% of their portfolio into Ark funds) being the primary topic of conversation in the span of months. If someone wants to allocate a reasonable amount of money to Ark-style aggressive growth, I'd very gradually add on gradual dips (and if things finally do get better with Covid, I think you'll likely see a more lasting rotation out of 2020's winners - you saw a significant rotation when the vaccine announcement happened in November, then a few days later people realized there was still a ways to go and piled back into growth) over the span of months and keep the allocation reasonable.",dvdmovie1,1,/r/investing/comments/li82a3/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gn1qbo4/,0.004,0.855,0.141,0.9962

328,EV," I believe Tesla is overvalued but you're underestimating the potential growth value that they are capable of. If you read their 10K, you would see how much exposure Tesla will have as part of your every day life in the near future. China importing barrels of oil could mean that their factories are expanding as well. China is actually trying to push EV's as much as possible which is why NIO and XPENG are receiving a ton of government support and why China has even allowed Tesla to operate there. In fact, China is the biggest EV market out right now so to try and imply that it isn't something sustainable or it's not heavily supported is quite a ridiculous statement. You know who just put down $1 million in Tesla calls? Nancy Pelosi. I guarantee you Nancy is going to try and push for EV's to get as much government support as possible. There's nothing gas companies or gas manufacturers can do to stop the EV trend. It's only inevitable that EV's will take over the market in the next few decades.

&#x200B;

""Not much competition.""You're actually proving why Tesla is in the position it is today. All of the other competitors are very far away from doing what Tesla has been capable of. Sure, they might have some EV alternative but Tesla dominates the market simply because they are way ahead of everyone else. Their EV sales continue to grow and they have now forced auto manufacturers to switch to EV's but unfortunately, they simply don't have the capabilities to control the cost and performance the way Tesla does. Tesla gets their batteries in-house and developed them much more affordable than other manufacturers. These new battery development and the ability to control their cost is why Tesla is planning on releasing a $25,000 fully electric sedan. Think about it from a consumer perspective. It's very likely tax credits for Tesla's will be reinstated so even a modest $7,500 (which is what most EV cars would get) would lower the price of a Tesla Sedan to $17,500. I know plenty of folks who would rather get a Tesla than any other sedan out in the market minus luxury models ranging upwards of $60k.

It's not just EV sales. The fact that Tesla has to sell regulatory credits to other car manufacturers so they can meet their EV quota tells you that these manufacturers are struggling to adapt to it. Then you're looking at Tesla being able to add superchargers, fully-autonomous driving, insurance, repairs, solar charging, and expanding into the semi/truck segment as well? The market for semi's is huge particularly because the trucking industry could use a huge overhaul. I would encourage you to read their 10K and you'll find that they are more prepared to become a behemoth of a company than you are giving them credit for.

It's premature to assume Tesla will meet every goal that they have. I personally think they are overvalued and that their $25,000 sedans will be delayed but you're truly not looking at the bigger picture here when it comes to the ecosystem that Tesla can create. Those 500,000 vehicles they sold last year will turn to 1-1.5 million next year. The growth will continue to climb while other car manufacturers lag behind. You used to only find Tesla's near the tech areas of California. I'm seeing Tesla's everywhere in NYC now. A typical drive to Manhattan and I will spot 10-15 Tesla's easily - which is insane considering you couldn't find any just a couple of years ago no matter how much you tried looking.

334,EV," Tesla is still undervalued IMO.

A quick comparison of the disruption magnitude and market capture & growth opportunity of the EV transition:

378,WFC," I like WFC as well. I have a strong position in them. I respect the people who comment that they won't invest in them for moral reasons, but I feel that emotion should be taken out of investing. Putting emotion into investing can lead to missed opportunities and I've found I do my worst trading when emotion is involved. And really if you look at it you can find so many moral reasons not to invest in so many companies, or even investing overall, that at a certain point, you have very limited options.

 So the reasons I like WFC:

1. As we come out of the pandemic, this focus on consumer lending should be an asset for WFC.
2. Their new management has focused a lot on control measures so that there will not be another scandal.
3. They are expanding their investment arm.

407,OI," youre understanding of future contracts is wrong.

two parties enter into a transaction, a buyer and a seller, the exchange matches them, and OI increases by 1. the broker doesnt ""set aside"" the underlying asset at all.  its up to the seller to deliver it based on the contract specs and the buyer to take delivery (if it is physically settled)

the futures price is never the same as the spot price, because it involves interest, storage costs, and carrying costs.

&#x200B;

more to your fundamental point, most parties who are seeking to take delivery of stuff (and not just speculating, (most futures traders are speculators)) dont need the stuff ""now"" they need it in the future.  if im a farmer trying to sell my ungrown corn crop, i dont have any corn ""now"" to sell.  so i sell a futures contract for after the harvest.  if i am an oil refiner and i anticipate the summer driving season in may will lead me to need a lot more crude oil in april to refine so it can be sold in may, and i think the price will go up, but i dont need it now, why would i buy oil ""now"" i would buy it for april delivery.

the entire point of future contracts is to match future expected demand with future expected supply, and hedge against price fluctuations in the meantime.  this is like quite basic. you should really learn more about them.",enginerd03,10,/r/investing/comments/liizuh/i_dont_understand_the_point_of_futures_markets/gn3g22d/,0.026,0.929,0.044,0.5273

413,NRZ," invest in mREITs, anti-inflation par excellance.

Listen up IVR is the name of the game. A mortgage REIT. I'm gonna keep my DD short because it's pretty obvious it's mooning soon. But it's a unique buy in moment these nut...these days...so I gotta share for the eternal reddit glory.

IVR invested mostly in business related mortgages and securities, got covided and dropped from a steady 5y 16$/share!!! down to 2ish (me buys), flat lined most of the year coz interest rates are on a historical 0 (that's zero) for ages now but that gonna change now that we all about to get well from all the vaccinations, and entrepreneurs gonna jump right back in the non-online economy.

yea yea keep reading...

How it dipped ? well interesting stuff about mreits is their stock price is pretty much hard glued to their book value of portfolio. BV that got margin called and destroyed with the ""businesses-need-to-shutdown"" agenda of 2020.

But...maybe they like staying at 2$ levels ... sure... backed by Invesco groupation, management that reorganized the portfolio asap, spreading the field on residential, saving the day AAAND selling some 22 mil stocks this whole week to raise millions of dollars ...not for debts...for investing and building back portfolio ! They smelled it, they have insider information or just plain good sense and judgement that we are getting back to business as usual.

Oh i forgot, look at that historical dividend yield, it's a REIT so 90% of gains must be repaid to stock holders via dividends. that's some more free money right there.

Does this look like it's going anywhere else than UP ?

Now listen, the time is now coz ...

\- it's a almost a penny stock and we love it, let's face it

\- first time someone is giving you a good advice before the volumes already went crazy

\- current BV around 4.10, stock dipped to 3.80 coz of dilution fears.

\- one of not so many reits or mreits that are still in the covid price window of opportunity

\- earnings in weeks with steady post covid growth, probabbly higher than 4.20

\- institutional invs. in it already

\- call options are super cheap

\- IV is low for volatility plays

\- worst worst case scenario you've got a post earnings +30% gains.

\- best case scenario you'll kill it on earnings date, you'll sell some for the next wsb meme but leave some for all the upcoming dividends and Q3 16$ target. You'll have a new favorite stock, one that finally pays.

They are both heavily invested in BTC, so they are talking their book so to speak.

424,ETH," I personally don't own hardly any btc, because I don't really believe in the way its set up. Once it stops minting new coins the network will depend on high fees to secure the network. High fees are not consumer friendly so consumers will wrap their btc on ethereum or polkadot or another cheaper secured network. This will drop fees on the btc network and then miners will ditch it. Kinda technical and there is room to avoid this but thats my take.

But I can argue for value in BTC as well. Its not backed by fiat currency, its not backed by anything. If fiat currencies collapsed, they would likely be collapsing through inflation. During inflation assets go up in value while fiats go down. BTC would *likely* go up as it isn't inflationary and its an asset.

I personally see much more value in other cryptos that actually do things. Ethereum is much more interesting, and its defi scene is cutting edge and progressing fast. I don't want to shill crypto though so I wont go into anything else.

My personal advice is that crypto is a high risk investment and should be treated as such. If you want to play put 1% of you net worth in to BTC and ETH. If you want other coins thats fine but put in even less.",tunatunatunatuna2,2,/r/investing/comments/lhxqip/why_im_uncertain_about_bitcoin/gn0doli/,0.102,0.771,0.127,0.9063

Just like a forex trader buys some foreign currency to gain more $ that doesn't mean foreign currency is valued just in dollars, it's just one of the valuation. Issue is that you are looking at it as a thing and not a currency I think.

But just so we are on the same page, Bitcoin will never ever replace fiat. That's certain. I am a firm believer in crypto as a currency and decentralized aspect but even if CCs replace fiat it won't be bitcoin as it's too expensive to make transactions with and it can't, and never will be able to handle amount of transactions fiat has.

No, because it’s then something other than Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s attraction is its immutability. By forking it you have changed something, and then it is no different to other crypto. Indeed, that’s why BCH hasn’t taken off as a payment method as there are other crypto assets that are better suited.

As above, it’s not the same as you are editing the source code. And for what it’s worth, I am not a Bitcoin fan.

The other thing that brings value to Bitcoin is the Lindy effect - life expectancy is proportional to current age. It’s been around the longest and so if there is a fork, the new fork needs to actual resolve a fundamental issue or there is no purpose to it.

>That's like me saying the 5 dollar bill I have in my hand is a special, so called schmodollar bill, at that's why it's worth more than your puny 5 dollar bill.

433,AT," Well, if an option is in the money it is valuable because it makes money. Keep in mind you can exercise an option at any time, you don't have to wait for it to expire.

Let's take the X stock as an example. If I buy a call for 105 and close to the expiry date the stock goes above 105, the option is valuable because if I exercise it, I can make money. 

But that value is increased simply because the strike price has been exceeded.

It's good to know WHY that option increases in price in the first place.

The rule is this: An option will pay the owner AT LEAST the amount that he would make if he exercises the option. This means that you can sell an option without having to exercise it and still make at least as much as if you exercised it. 

You actually make more (percentage wise) if you don't exercise and sell instead. Think about it. If you buy an option for 100 dollars and you make 200 dollars in profit, that's a 200% increase. If you actually exercised the option, you had to first buy the 100 stocks and sell them. The 100 stocks would cost you more than the 100 dollars that you paid gor the premium. So obviously, the percentage would be smaller. This is called leverage - being able to make the same profit with less money invested.

I would say any mortgage company was responsible for the crash if they supplied subprime lending.

That would mean many REITs that involved personal loans (non-commercial) were likely involved if diversified and had a high yield, at least to some extent.

Edit:

I take that back, seems even commercial loans aided in the crash too. 

WMC seemed to supply GE with some subprime lending.

So yes, looks like you are right kind of.

450,CEO," I’d like to get in on the Bumble IPO, mostly as the Bumble app remains popular, and I think they’re onto at least one decent idea for exploring different verticals - the “BFF” concept. The competitors to this at present are mostly Meet-up.com and forums such as this, so I think it has solid growth potential. I’m less convinced it’ll take a chunk out of the business side monopolised by LinkedIn, mostly as I’m not sure people want to mix business and dating, and it has the potential to get awkward quick.

I think online dating will continue to grow, particularly post pandemic. If Bumble drops to a (comparatively vs IPO hype, and in the current market) sensible price (eg post moon, hopefully more the $40 - 50 range), I’ll get in. But I think it’s dramatically overvalued. 

The woman initiating concept and female empowerment is something the app goes for, and their CEO embodies. BUT, I’m not totally convinced this is a market niche. Why can’t women make the choice to initiate on literally any other swipe based dating site, for example Tinder, Hinge etc?

Personally, I much prefer Hinge as an app. Straw polling those who’ve used the apps suggest Hinge is likely to become a front runner, given you can show more personality and engage with text rather than just likes. I think Match Group (MTCH) is good as a competitor for this reason, because it has Hinge as well as the OG modern app - Tinder. But it also has bloat, like PlentyOfFish. That said, how much can it grow from its current valuation, at the $150 mark?

Bumble at $80 feels overpriced even for this market, given the lack of any *real* niche; with the popularity and market cap of competitors; and until they successfully grow other segments such as BFF. Particularly as swelling to the size of MTCH would feel excessively overpriced. That to me suggests a crash, or an upside of a maximum 50% increase.

Just to offer some education, BMBL isn't all about the men...it's also about women dating women, women meeting women with similar interests (i.e. children)...and yes, women initiating contact with men. Some people won't get past the old days where men pounded their chests and women sat around waiting for another date....we don't live in that world anymore and that's the beauty of BMBL. They've hit a demographic that has been patiently waiting for change and they've inspired that change. They have already grown in leaps and bounds.

And yes, the progressive women I know, are more than happy to initiate dates, and the men? Well the progressive one's anyway, are thrilled to be on the receiving end.",renaedarlene,-4,/r/investing/comments/lijnmn/bumble_bmbl_i_wish_i_could_buy_100_shares/gn3okxw/,0.017,0.802,0.181,0.9698
453,OCGN," I am very new to this and after managing my mom's Ameritrade account after my dad died (nothing like being thrown into something without any understanding with my mom's financial life depending on it), I just recently opened an account for myself with MooMoo on my Iphone. Initially, I transferred in $100 from my checking account, and purchased a few shares of Levi's and Blackberry, just getting my little toe wet. I started researching and reading. I would rather go in very small knowing I will probably take losses or even lose everything. Now that I am finding my way around the app, I've deposited another $600. I find for myself, I learn a little at a time and research companies like crazy, and it has given me something to feel excited about after a year of gloom and doom. I have since added a few companies which have prospects in a COVID vaccine and Alzheimers, and every day I watch that money deplete, however...I am in it for the long haul. I look at this as a very inexpensive education and way to expand my mind, as long as I don't put money in that I can't afford to lose. My $600 is about as much as I can lose, but peanuts to most. It is cheap for the price of an education and something positive for my mind. I also look at it as entertainment, of which I have nothing else at this time. Can't even go to a theater. It is fun, as long as one is in it for the right reasons with the same mindset that it's like going to Vegas...you may know how to play poker well, but it doesn't mean you aren't going to lose. Did you enjoy it though? Lastly, what I'm finding is no matter how much you research something there are variables; COVID, a lawsuit, a business failure, etc. etc. Those variables are out of our control. There are also variables on the other side of the game...OCGN which I'm losing money in right now, suddenly gets the emergency approval in the U.S. for their vaccine. It a gamble, an educated gamble no less...but a gamble. My dad could have lost everything during the recession. His stocks dived for a long time. He just waited.

458,TSLA," >do you actually believe that there would be LITERALLY TRILLIONS of dollars flowing into this stock? Because to increase its price we need those numbers at this point  

This is somewhat of a misunderstanding. In order to get to a multi-trillion market cap, people don't need to sell trillions of dollars of other assets and buy TSLA shares. The shares already exist and when one person buys one, another is selling it; there's no net inflow (except when Tesla is selling new shares which it often does). The price they agree on just has to be high enough. The question is whether the market thinks a multi-trillion dollar allocation of Tesla is appropriate in its aggregate portfolio, and whether a higher share price makes it less attractive. Usually the answer to that question is yes, but I think it's fair to say that is not as true in 2021 as it has been in most years since 2000.",kiwimancy,4,/r/investing/comments/ligun1/the_incentive_to_short_tsla_is_just_massive_at/gn34jmf/,0.039,0.853,0.108,0.7502
