11,RH," I read into the DTCC and NSCC’s rules and regulations a few weeks ago to try to understand RH’s argument after the hearing. You might have some insight I couldn’t find.

You mention regulators and auditors can request information. I understand auditors can make requests to trace transactions, recalculate totals, etc etc to independently verify the accuracy and completeness of what the company claims the numbers are. But since the company is private, the public never gets to see the assurances. 

I don’t understand who the regulators would be that make request information, other than the SEC. I see the DTCC as a *effectively* a self-regulatory entity in the financial markets, but maybe I’m mistaken. 

1. Which regulators are making requests that need to remain confidential? I imagine foreign regulators are at least some. 

2. If the DTCC/NSCC is setting the capital requirements according to a regulatory formula, why don’t we just get the raw calculation publicly, instead of just explanations of that calculation? RH is able to disclose the capital requirement totals in their written statement for the hearing, so NSCC should be able to disclose their calculation to those totals.",OhwowTaux,4,/r/stocks/comments/m14jye/a_10_part_series_that_will_clearly_explain_what/gqcrn8s/,0.029,0.962,0.009,-0.5661

1. If you did so you would effectively wipe out the investors money involved in that transaction, while admitting that you allowed counterfeit shares to exist.

2. They can do so, however there is a constant pressure in the money (read: fees) required to do so, as well as there being actual due dates for the MOASS.

to answer your question, whatever the fuck you want. The MOASS depends on the big boy hedge funds deciding when to sell and how, but from what I've seen the retail   🦍 could easily own the current float of GME themselves, which means **YOU SET THE PRICE.**

I personally have limits set at multiple prices above $100,000/share, due to the potential spikes we may see, but for all I know this could for a split second go to $1,000,000.

16,GME," There is a huge possibility that that is the case, however the share recall will trigger the MOASS in advance, meaning we can get rid of our shares before they are verified in exchange for cash.

Not only is that the case but if the shares were found to be counterfeit, CEDE views all shares on its books as real shares (hence why they can be traded) which means either GME accepts the new shares into the float, or they declare the shares worthless which would cause all manner of lawsuits to kick off in regards to fraud.

What terrifies me, is how the fuck are these shorts even gonna pay this shit? How the fuck is anybody gonna cover these short positions? They may have billions, likely hundreds of billions, but with these projections, GME could bankrupt Jeff Bezos if he was in the short position.

29,USA," I wont be posting referring this, as I've said in another post

ok so just looked at part 8, Cede & company.

Cede and company is an institution that's in control of verifying the stocks.

aka they have the stocks but you get a ""copy"" which is the equivalent of the stocks, this is done so that instant access all over the world can happen without any trouble, sounds simple and easy as far as I can see this is the same as ""digital Fiat"". you dont have physical money but a digital write of that is the equivalent of it and gives you access to fiat money.

it's a subsidiary but separate legal entity (or legal ""person"") part of the DTCC.  
The DTCC is a ""private"" company, in other words it's its own legal person as well.  
but it is not part of the USA, which makes sense to me as it shouldn't show preference over countries.

it is however not ""owned"" by anyone, it is lead by a board, like all big companies  
[https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board](https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board)

street name securities are also what's called if a broker holds onto a stock for a client, not when they do it, this is a misconception in my book.  
And I have to be honest I'm now halfway through and this is sounding more and more like a conspiracy filled with halve truths to sting a person along.  
(want to make a lie believable, sprinkle a bit of truth in there as the old adage goes)

I'm sorry but the more I read it comes across as a conspiracy theory with loads of conjecture, no citing of sources etc, as someone with a legal/business background this is hard for me to actually swallow as the difference between conspiracy and facts are sources.

I think that you'll be lucky if your calls break even, and if you do make money it's likely going to gut you over the next few months in the process. To me, today proved that the market is drunk on stimulus and that more money is going to do little to support it the prices we see, even now. I could be wrong, it could turn around, but I'm not counting on it. Sounds like you learned a $3k dollar lesson, either learn from it or double down and make it $6k/$9k/$12k (judging by your position I'm guessing $12k was your investment or thereabouts).

You’re in a good position, as at this price, I bet you could roll them further out if you prefer - either even or for a small credit.

But remember: had you simply bought TSM @ 120, you’d be facing the same loss, but without the premium collected.

178,SPH," I've been keeping a regular buy /sell single going in SPH for weeks.  The company cut the dividend at the beginning of the pandemic, then has cut debt and become even more stable since then.

 SPH does a nice little bounce between $14.90 and $15.25 over and over again.  I buy when it goes down below $14.95, and I sell when it pops over $15.20.  Day after day.  That's a 2% gain on a simple little trade.  Traditionally the stock market returns 8 to 13% per year . . . so at 2% per trade . . . over and over I'm able to get 1/4 of a good year daily with almost no risk.

Also, since SPH still pays an 8% dividend, if I gut stuck in the trade for a few weeks or months, the reasonable income is already in place.

Large sporting events’ fans, concert/theatre fans, and conventions aren’t coming back for awhile.  And even when they do, it’s going to be years before they’re at the level they were.  

Large meetings and events, critical to hotels, will take even longer to return.  International travel will take years to return to the level it was.  Leisure travel l, at least in Boston, is directly related to everything mentioned above so until ALL of those things are back to where they were, it will remain down.

Combine all that with the fact that the COVID adaptations taken since it started proved many people don’t have to actually head into an office to do their job, or a college classroom to learn, or be in a meeting room to have a meeting and there’s really only 1 conclusion:  hospitality is fucked for a good long while.

261,IP," Sony has all the tools to be a great company except leadership. It needs someone with a broader, overarching vision that's able to unify its disparate pieces into a cohesive company. With its recent acquisition of Crunchyroll (and previously AnimeLab and Wakamin), it now has almost a global monopoly on anime. But...it just can't pull it together. 

Show me the Sony that combines the best parts of Disney and Apple. Show me the quality streaming apps through its PS5 bolstered by Sony having its tentacles in basically every anime production committee. Show me the Sony that leverages its musical talent into its other services. Show me the Sony that invests in its accidental billion dollar mobile game franchise to grow it further and make it last rather than let it slowly bleed out. Show me the Sony that uses its never-ending IP to create its own exclusive log of streaming content. 

I agree with you that all the pieces are there for it to do great things. You've got the hardware side of things. You've got a rapidly growing anime/content side of things.

>Moreover, Sony has undertaken a series of concerted efforts to attain a leaner organizational structure. The company announced several changes to the Sony Group’s organizational structure to boost individual businesses and leverage the diversity of its business portfolio. Effective Apr 1, 2021, the current Sony Corporation will change its name to Sony Group Corporation. Sony Electronics Corporation, which currently operates the electronics business that is the origin of Sony’s business, will acquire the name Sony Corporation. Of the Sony Group’s core businesses, Game & Network Services, Music, Pictures and Financial Services have established executive structures. The electronics businesses, including Imaging & Sensing Solutions, will establish optimal executive structures for each business.

Everyone here is discussing them as if they only make PS5s and TVs, which is not the case. In fact, I believe the most valuable part of the company is their Japanese insurance/financial division, though that is based on an old article I read ages ago and I don't have the numbers on that right in front of me.

The reorganization seems like a good sign in terms of a reconsideration of SNE's value, more so than potential PS5 sales this year. Plus, it seems like a lot of big Japanese companies are suffering from the weak Japanese economy and market right now, so with those combined, I really like SNE to gain in the coming year or two. 

On a related note, I also think Honda is extremely undervalued right now as a result of the JPN market. According to FINVIZ, they are sitting at a forward PE of around 9, with a P/B of 0.66 even with the gains it's made so far this month.

I assume you mean ""high"" as in ""high value"" (= low P/FCF ratio), because a P/FCF of 13 is low.

But to address your point assuming you mean ""high"" as in ""high value"": new console generation COST a lot of money, so it is the opposite of what you're implying. Sony's PlayStation business up to now has always posted a big loss in the years during which a console launched. Profit margins vastly improves as the generation goes on. PS5 is not different. Sony's PlayStation business had a \~25% operating profit margin before the PS5 launched. Last quarter it dropped to \~8% because of the PS5 launch. It is actually pretty remarkable that PlayStation is posting their highest ever fiscal year operating profit ($3.3B) DESPITE the PS5 launch and the enormous costs/losses associated with the PS5 launch.

Once the production costs of PS5 go down in 1-2 years, their profits will be much higher.

So what you're implying is not correct. Their P/FCF is low (= high value stock) DESPITE the fact that they're having a temporary loss on PS5 hardware.

I actually think that their PS5 hardware pricing strategy is waaay too needlessly agressive, especially for the PS5 digital edition (they're taking a huge loss there for very little marketshare benefit considering they can't even come close to meeting demand).

446,GE," For what it's worth: Hexcel (HXL). It's a good day to buy an industrial with NASDAQ so heated, and its valuation never reoriented itself after COVID.

If Alaska Airlines, Spirit Airlines etc are trading high, Hexcel is the functional equivalent of a ticking money bomb

Its bread and butter is building what planes are made out of, but (1) its services division has been surprisingly robust, and if the GE / AerCap airfleet deal is legit then a good services division is what you want out of a company like Hexcel, (2) the COVID relief bill sucked and fucked a lot of defense contractors, and (3) Boeing got a new line of credit so as far as the aerospace industry's recession is concerned it's like Churchill said, it may not be the beginning of the end but it is the end of the beginning

The downside is the p/e and general fact planes just aren't being made right now. However I think if you look at its price history only meme stocks move faster. There's a lot of eyes on it.

Fairfax is  choked because the stock hasn't performed for them, but they obviously  believe in the company, they've been holding for so long. This company  is ready to moon in the next year or two as an EV play which will hold  its high value. They've been slowly but surely building their company  up.

504,IMO," I lost thousands selling near the bottom, convinced it was done. Walked away hating myself and then decided to stop looking at it.

Then it kept popping up as a trending topic on unrelated news articles when it started going up again, so that killed that idea and I had to confront the fact I was even more of an idiot than I thought. 

FOMO'd in and it started dropping instantly. Felt like even more shit for doing so the whole time I was back in. Did recover some and I managed to get back out at my (new) break-even, so I avoided losing any more money, at least. Decided to stay away again.

And yet I still keep seeing the updates.

Unless you got in at the low-mid double-digits or just have enough cash on hand that you don't really care what happens (which is a sentiment I will never actually share), this is just going to be a massive stress-ball IMO. Personally, I can't justify the risk and that level of stress again. 

I already feel like a massive failure (especially seeing how many people have gained so much from something I've lost on), and I'll be even further from 'OK' if this thing does wind up at some ridiculous number, but whatever. I'm not 'OK' with losing the chance to become an instant millionaire, but I can't let myself descend toward gambling addiction either, so the whole thing ends up feeling like a trap to me.",GKMLTT,28,/r/stocks/comments/m13n1k/rstocks_daily_thread_on_meme_stocks_tuesday_mar/gqbqi7z/,0.133,0.793,0.074,-0.9216

It's become quite fun now that I don't have any significant amount of money invested into it. I'm already up over 100% so far. Even if it tanks and I sell on the way down, I'll earn some money at least. That's where I can see the justification of buying at $200, or even $300 comes from.

Fubo could face mergers by other competitors like we saw between DraftKing and Dish. HOWEVER, the reason why I’m so bullish on Fubo and why this recent dip is a massive buying opportunity is that Dish + DraftKing merger is not even a big threat. Dish is LOSING 100,000+ subscribers quarterly. Why? Because unlike Fubo, it requires satellite (not the future). Also, Verizon has a 7%+ stake in Fubo which gives it a lot of potential partners.

614,AAPL," You’re right, the point is opportunity cost. The problem is that stocks often don’t respond rationally. Take AAPL dropping along with the NASDAQ the last few weeks. The thesis to get into the company at pre drop prices and to hold for the long term was strong, and remains strong. But it continues to bleed.

The issue is when that bleeding or stagnation leads either to panic or frustration. So, you sell your position either for something else solid with higher growth potential, or potentially FOMO into something on a run. It could work out well, and you see good, much quicker, gains. Or, the stock you go into might trade sideways or drop, and the stock you got of rockets.

As much as people FUD Facebook with legislative headwinds and the “dying” of the Facebook platform itself, it has incredible amounts of cash on hand and is successful in multiple industry verticals. Any break-up could actually benefit shareholders (getting shares in all the component companies.

As a result, people are getting at the relatively safety of holding FAANG stocks - that they will ultimately go up again - together with the likelihood of further growth. Versus dropping that for another company out of frustration, where it’s 50/50 on whether it gains quicker, or remains growing.",BuffettsBrokeBro,1,/r/stocks/comments/m0y59x/selling_at_a_loss_to_purchase_a_different_stock/gqb9d46/,0.077,0.753,0.17,0.966

617,IP," I was thinking about Nintendo but didn't like it that much. I understand that their hardware business is low margin and really each new hardware release is kind of a gamble. Could be great one like Switch or could be commercial failure like Wii U. Software business is great and their IP are world class. If I was to invest in Nintendo it would be because because of their great IP. However, here too there are things I don't like. Their IP is unsurprisingly tied to their official hardware but that really means that they cannot monetise their IP to its fullest potential. Mario on Switch is one thing but imagine revenue from Mario on PS4, Xbox, PC, Android, iOS. On the other hand I understand why they don't want to go multi-platform. Nonetheless, its really annoying situation where they have word class IP but they also have to limit its revenue potential.

You might remember that they been recently releasing some games on mobile but here again they must limit themselves by releasing some games but not the best games. Those are for official hardware only. Very disappointing again considering that gaming is moving towards mobile and there is huge market fo high quality, loved IPs there. Speaking of mobile there is also a question how that impacts their handheld hardware. Mobile gaming is just so accessible. Everyone has a phone, phones are getting cheaper, hardware is getting better and better, games are getting more advanced and Bluetooth controllers are cheap and easy to connect. I just really worry about their handheld hardware becoming small niche.

What is their streaming strategy by the way? Last time I looked at Nintendo they had none. Also very disappointing considering gaming might be moving to the cloud when 5G is fully rolled out. Here again the more streaming they do the more they kill their own hardware business so maybe thats the reason they don't do streaming.

Finally, I don't have access to real shares. I have access to ADRs but they are IOUs of real shares so its kind of owning share by proxy. I'm not very big fan of that.

It's good company. They have many positive things going on but I personally don't like their big picture story so I didn't even get to analysing fundamentals. I just stopped there. It looks to me like its not the kind of buy and forget safer investment that I usually like.",Ironleg01,1,/r/stocks/comments/m17cvv/thoughts_about_ntdoy/gqbz8wc/,0.131,0.736,0.133,0.7246
618,IP," I think a lot of people are overlooking the value of the IP outside of the console/games. Their main business is certainly video games but there is so much more potential for revenue. I think the theme parks are going to be a huge catalyst for more Mario-related experiences.

619,IP," I think they are moving away from having their hardware be their only avenue towards their IP with the launch of Super Nintendo World. Also, completely understand the gamble on new hardware releases. Sure, Switch is awesome and they struck gold with it, but the next release could be a flop. That's what happens with innovators; not every idea is a winner. Regardless, I don't think that mobile gaming is a threat to a full-fledged mobile console like the Switch. Totally agree with their online gaming infrastructure. They are far behind the times with it but it's also insanely cheap ($20/year) so pretty much every person with a Switch has it. Not sure how much revenue they are bringing in but at least it's appropriately priced.",yeksim,1,/r/stocks/comments/m17cvv/thoughts_about_ntdoy/gqc0b3a/,0.081,0.749,0.17,0.9303
620,IP," I'd disagree. Next console is likely going to continue the ""switch"" brand and Nintendo has shown itself to be the console for JRPGs and kid games, two core groups. 

The switch console itself was great and sold with Breath of the Wild and every major IP they've promoted has basically knocked it out of the park. 

The console *after* the next one? Maybe not. But this next one is going to be a more powerful switch with a better screen and likely have backwards compatibility. With those features, you can buy one and have your ""spare"" to give to someone else, take on the go, give to a kid, etc., similar to how people used gameboys or DSes when they upgraded to the newer version.",MeltedTwix,1,/r/stocks/comments/m17cvv/thoughts_about_ntdoy/gqcoeg7/,0.02,0.883,0.097,0.8832

625,OLED," I definitely think Nintendo has a consistent market, I mean I love all their first party games, but every time they release a console that is simply an improvement (gamecube to N64, Wii U to Wii) people seem to not care about them. They’ve run handhelds for decades so we are in uncharted territory by them combining the two markets. The screen is OLED but it’s still 720p in handheld mode and honestly I’m not sure 4K really matters for Nintendo games because they’re so cartoony. I’m not sure how many people upgraded their ps4 to Ps4 pro for 4K and that’s depicting real people and much larger games. I’m also not sure exactly how much the New 3DS sold vs the 3DS but it didn’t sell as well and it had better upgrades than this next switch.

When I say next console I mean the one after this switch XL or whatever they’ll call it, but I think this new switch will not be innovative enough for people justify spending another $300 and making their current switch a throw away. The only reason I’m going to buy one is because I collect video games. No one can deny the switch family as a whole is a huge success for Nintendo, but I’m not sure how well the second iteration will sell without exclusive games moving forward. And considering most games released for switch are just ports from the Wii U, Nintendo not releasing them for base switch would annihilate everyone who bought one. The rumors I’ve seen are that they will have a couple, mainly 3rd party, exclusive games just like the New 3DS to the 3DS. We’ll see what happens my prediction is a lot of speculation, but I don’t think this new switch will surpass pandemic switch numbers.

Also, personal note here, they aren’t kid games. Sure they’re “family friendly” but Nintendo makes some of the best games on the market for any age and they all don’t have any comparable games in terms of play style. Even sequels are entirely different games than their predecessor",ribbitrabbs,4,/r/stocks/comments/m17cvv/thoughts_about_ntdoy/gqcscbn/,0.066,0.799,0.135,0.9824

627,SNE," That's all fair, and I don't think NTDOY is a bad investment at all. I actually didn't realize Nintendo had so much higher revenue in 2020 than Sony! It really surprised me to look at the numbers. I don't think that growth is sustainable YOY and is mostly due to the pandemic, but they do speak for themselves in that sense.

I will admit my hesitancy is mostly personal. The NASDAQ correction scared me off tech a little bit so I'm trying to diversify with broader tech companies when I do invest in them. I am also a little fatigued by everyone on here and in other stock subs talk so much about companies that the Reddit hivemind loves (which is almost entirely tech/gaming) that drowns out the talk of anything else. 

What really intrigues me about Sony are 1) the upcoming corporate reorganization (effective 4/1) intended to streamline Sony Group's diverse holdings, and 2) increased profits from Sony Financial as the yen rebounds and the Japanese markets improve post-COVID, now that SNE owns that division outright. I also believe the rumored deal between Apple and Sony for streaming rights to the Sony Pictures/Columbia catalog will happen at some point this year, because it makes too much sense for both parties: Apple TV+ desperately needs a reparatory catalog of content to compete in the market, and SNE remains the largest media conglomerate without a streaming ""hub"" for all its holdings (and they have repeatedly stated they won't create one, probably because they don't want Vue 2.0). That is wishful thinking, sure, but, again, it makes a lot of sense on both sides and would benefit both in the long run, especially as the post-COVID purge starts taking out underperforming streaming platforms.",well-lighted,1,/r/stocks/comments/m17cvv/thoughts_about_ntdoy/gqdaxxu/,0.077,0.814,0.109,0.9017

You can find insider trading reports and track buys and sells in some ETF's like ARK. I have seen that ARK recently bought some SQ. I have had a little bit of trouble figuring out the value of OPEN recently, but love the company and what it's doing. To deal with this I have been mirroring ARK trades on it for the last week as I learn more about it, because I trust Cathie Woods knows what she's doing. Don't mindlessly follow others, just use them as a guide to learn more. 

I can't speak for SENS, but I know the value proposition for SQ is still very much intact. They've put up some good growth and recently announced they are doing banking.",Howell_Jolly11,2,/r/stocks/comments/m0qmpa/how_to_deal_with_losses/gq9gxe5/,0.027,0.786,0.187,0.9921
633,SQ," This may not work for everyone, but this is how I think about it:

Reassess why you bought it and if its value to you has changed since you bought it. If not, hold and, if you can, buy more. If you're not seeing more future value at the current prices, this may be a good signal to sell and put money into some good deals you see.

The $240 sale was only 70 shares that I'd only bought for a short term swing trade.  The $255 sale was because I didn't want to hold through earnings which has a bad history lately for many companies.

I know I can't time the market but I'm skittish to buy in at the moment.  I still believe in SQ long term.

I don't have a reentry point.  It's more of a let me check the price in 10 days.  If it's bounced back to 230, oh well do nothing.

688,SPH," The TIME and LEVERAGE elements are the key to the dangers.  

With stocks, you can hold and wait out any dip.  With options, the ticking away of seconds means that you could be right on an idea, but wrong on the timeline and lose.

Since playing with options about 20 years ago, I realized ""Leverage is a big stick.""  As you know, the way to move big objects with a smaller weight is with a lever . . . but when the lever fails, you get hurt way more than if you were doing a simple lift.

Combining the TIME clock running out and the LEVERAGE stick . . . and you put yourself in a much much much more dangerous position than just buying and trading stocks.

THAT is why, after many years, I've decided to play for safe singles rather than dangerous home runs --

For example -- 

 SPH -- does a nice little bounce between $14.90 and $15.25 over and over again.  I buy when it goes down below $14.95, and I sell when it pops over $15.20.  Day after day.  That's a 2% gain on a simple little trade.  Traditionally the stock market returns 8 to 13% per year . . . so at 2% per trade . . . over and over I'm able to get 1/4 of a good year daily with almost no risk.

Also, since SPH pays an 8% dividend, if I gut stuck in the trade for a few weeks or months, the reasonable income is already in place.

689,IMO," No, buying the contract gives you the option to buy 100 shares (1 contract) at a selected strike price. If you choose to exercise the contract and purchase at the strike price you must have the capital to purchase 100 shares at that strike price. Alternatively, you could sell the contract for a potential profit. You may only need the underlying stock in options trading if you choose to sell covered calls or buy puts.

Edit: IMO one of the best ways for new options traders to get a feel for options trading is to sell covered calls of an underlying stock you own (as a new trader do not sell calls on a stock you do not own, these are naked calls and can result in terrible losses) or to sell puts on a company you like at a strike price you would not mind buying in at (you will need the capital if you get assigned this contract so keep that in mind).",TheBioScout,3,/r/stocks/comments/m0xpwp/options_trading/gqc2tg0/,0.066,0.853,0.081,0.6908

Also, the CEO and CFO bought $2mil in shares in January at ~$55.50.

693,IRR," They keep pushing out their own roadmap with delays and have lost the aggressive leadership position that defined them for so long. Hence their growth forecast and multiple has remained low.

I believe in a strong upside for the coming decade and that it is a good investment. Why?

Let's start with the scenario where Intel doesn't catch up and just continous current performance with a minimal year over year growth of 5%.
Doing a valuation based on cashflow gives an expected IRR of more than15%. Already a good investment.


Additional upside factors:

Their 14nm node had a rough start because they were implementing advanced first-of-a-kind technologies.
Combine this with what was basically a management mistake to aggressively implement multiple of equally complex advances and you end up with barely yielding 14nm to start and 10nm to follow. Their 14nm has been 'fixed' and 10nm is coming (finally).

Don't be fooled by the marketing names for chip technology (any number before 'nm' is just a marketing term these days), Intel is more behind their own original roadmap than behind TSMC.
Nothing than can't be made up coming 5 years with some elbow grease and capable management.

There have been real management changes, not only at C-level but also at VP level, to get manufacturing and process development back on track.
They know what wemt wrong and how to learn and recover from it, it just takes time to patch up the 10nm process, and this focus has delayed the 7nm somewhat as well.

The new management is being pragmatic and will use TSMC's capability to start Intel 7nm chips so they can get product out while finalizing the cleanups internally.
TSMC has historically made lower margin chips for Intel, now is the first time they are doing a flagship design out of the gate.

 This ia good as it provides breathing room for Intel to recover their processes while still capitalizing on the value of their processor design, at lower margins compared to if they would make themselves but still good.
Soon after that they will ramp up 7nm production inhouse at higher margins.
The close partnership with TSMC for flagship products is good as it reduces future risk of capacity/capability as well as allowing Intel to optimize what they make in-house versus outsource even more than before.

In case you didn't know, TSMC is building a huge factory in Arizona next to Intel’s existing factory. So I bet the partnership remains to benefit both :-)

There are other upside factors, but I can't estimate how those will evolve from marketing slides to revenue...

698,IMO," They're appropriately priced given the risk of not ever closing the gap with TSMC fab wise and not ever closing the gap with the M1 arch along with its future improvements. If Alder Lake and desktop 10nm+ delivers, $70+ is IMO not unreasonable as that would also reflect well on Sapphire Rapids. Dips below $50 haven't lasted too long because, in my opinion, the problems they have are at least tractable with the current resources at their disposal, but that may not be the case forever. If Alder Lake, Sapphire Rapids, and Xe (all variants) fail to compete, their expected future growth would be greatly compromised, and a drop to <= $40 wouldn't surprise me.

Should they regain their footing in the CPU market, they also have some growth potential they could explore with Mobileye, Optane, chip packaging, optronic interconnects, etc. -- they haven't exactly been doing nothing with the R&D money, but again, this only matters if their primary source of revenue is defended.",ifdef,2,/r/stocks/comments/m0wqic/why_is_intel_so_undervalued/gqaxdfq/,0.074,0.842,0.084,-0.0558

712,AMD," I would alter the statement on the recent decrease on AMD a bit differently.

You are always buying on future earnings, however some stock's current market pricing is on future growth of earnings vs. pricing on a company maintaining their current earnings into the future.

AMD had a P/E priced in the 35-40 range and has no dividend. So the important part is whenever there is a correction or downturn in the market, whatever the cause, a company that is pricing in more future growth in earnings will be prone to larger downfalls in stock price. That is because outside variables are putting future growth in earnings in jeopardy.

INTC is operating more like a value company with a decent dividend and lower room for future growth of earnings. Their value will hold up better in a downturn or correction, because their stock price didn't factor in future earnings growth into its price. The P/E is low.

I mention this because this is where krios is stuck on understanding the situation.

Both statements are true, because each company is in a different situation and being priced in the market differently for different reasons.

More broadly said:

\-AMD is down because the market is creating extra risks for pricing the stock not for current earnings, but for growth of future earnings.

\-INTC is more insulated from the downturn affecting growth of future earnings, most people were not pricing that into the stock price, but there is concern they are going to face more competition creating future uncertainty from their established market share. They can only grow their earnings, by making overall market demand grow. There isn't much room for them to gain market share.

AMD doesn't need the market demand to grow, they just need to take existing market share from Intel.

&#x200B;

INTC is big on internal production. In the past that has allowed them to maintain quality and be innovative, but now that is what is hindering them with the 10nm and below chips.

I bought into AMD a few years ago, because they were re-negotiating with closer production companies they previously used and were outright kicking some to the curb. To me that was a cue they were onto something and trying to make something happen and that paid off. They got rid of the impediments preventing them from reaching manufacturing benchmarks.

INTC needs to do the same, whether it happens internal or they breakdown and finally work with outside producers where they can achieve innovation through competition.

I am really bullish on AMD, but if INTC remains so undervalued, while maintaining a strock dividend, I might buy into a small position in INTC. That will sort of hedge portfolio in case AMD slips up in the future or if INTC breaks through their barriers. Either one of these could harm my position in AMD, while INTC improves.

INTC is also well positioned to deal smaller products, like the ""internet of things."" Creating more smart devices. They will face more competition, self-made ARM chips, and other players, compared to the near duopoly on personal computer processors. However they are well positioned and have bought into a good range of patents and research and production capabilities.

850,AMZN," Good practice? I don't know, but it matches my risk tolerance.

&#x200B;

You can use 20/20 hindsight for your case study:

if you'd bought AMZN early -- 1998 for $4 (or whatever it was in '98) -- and sold after it doubled, or increased 40%, or  increased 10%, ... you'd have doubled your money! Or made 40%!! Or made 10%!!! Great! Ah, but look at that lost opportunity!

A buy and hold would have been the obvious hindsight-adjusted thing to do.

But you didn't know that at the time.

So would there have been an approach to hedge your risk against both future/unknown stock price trajectories? An obvious approach is to take :some: of your winnings off the table, turn them from paper gains into real gains, ... but let the rest ride. If they double again, or go up 40% again, take a little more off the table.  If you want to dip into market timing -- and the adage is that time in market beats market timing -- then sell a little at highs, play the volatility and buy back in at lows (it's tough to spot the lows, obv., but you know it was lower than it was).

You can use 20/20 hindsight for your case study:

if you'd bought AMZN early -- 1998 for $4 (or whatever it was in '98) -- and sold after it doubled, or increased 40%, or  increased 10%, ... you'd have doubled your money! Or made 40%!! Or made 10%!!! Great! Ah, but look at that lost opportunity!

A buy and hold would have been the obvious hindsight-adjusted thing to do.

But you didn't know that at the time.

So would there have been an approach to hedge your risk against both future/unknown stock price trajectories? An obvious approach is to take :some: of your winnings off the table, turn them from paper gains into real gains, ... but let the rest ride. If they double again, or go up 40% again, take a little more off the table.  If you want to dip into market timing -- and the adage is that time in market beats market timing -- then sell a little at highs, play the volatility and buy back in at lows (it's tough to spot the lows, obv., but you know it was lower than it was).

853,ENPH," It depends. So far, taking profit mostly have caused me pain. Examples are ENPH (I got out at 96), PINS (I got out at around 40),  TSLA (most painful one, exited at 350, pre-split, after buying it around 250).

But on the other hand, there are cases where I wish I had taken profit, and see all of it disappear or get reduced tremendously.

For example, MGNI. I was up almost 130%, now in two weeks, that has been reduced to just 70%. IQQH, I was up almost 50% at some point, now -9%. 

So probably the best decision is to set some limit. e.g. I take x% out, if it grows to y%. You set the x and y based on how confident you are on the company. For example, for a solid company like APPLE, MSFT, etc, x will be very low, and y will be high, while for a biotech company that is not generating any revenue yet but riding on good expectations/story, you can have x quite high (e.g. take 50% out when the gain is 100%, basically letting just the profit ride...)

When you only look at stocks as lottery tickets yes. When you look at stocks as what they are, companies, it’s not gambling, it’s investing.

You might see me sell a Barrett .50BMG rifle for $12,000. Doesn’t make me rich. Our markup is on ammo and accessories. There’s a mass shortage of ammo. Covid played a big part. Currently the largest ammo manufacturers owe 1.2 billion in backorders.
One small problem. No primers to go boom. So those that have ammo are hoarding and waiting for the burst. Kind of like people on here with their stocks. So there is currently no supply and high demand. All of this is readily found on google. I’m sorry someone said it would hit 30. But take a look at ruger, smith and Wesson and vista outdoors. If you didn’t know, vista is an unbrella for the largest manufacturers in the industry. If that stock ain’t worth $30.00 then streak Ammo’s shitty poww stock sure isn’t. Do you can see why it’s so odd the way each stock price is in the 2A stock industry.
Edit- ammo is priced by retail buyers and buyers only. For example. Let’s say a box of ammo costs me 5.00 for 50 rounds or 9mm. No this isn’t a real price. I sell it all day precovid for 8.00. Ok well now Covid happened and my prices went up but not a lot. Maybe I’m paying 8.00 for a box and have to charge 12.00. Well the big store down the street has all the ammo in town. They make it $80 for 50 rounds. The first god damn person to buy it, sets the industry price. Now dealers know what it’s worth. They sell it online to other states who have a worse shortage and make even more.
I kid you not, I had a customer ask me to auction his ammo off. 1 case of 9mm 1,000 rounds went for 895 plus shipping. Best it ever went for was $169.99 which is exactly what my customer paid 2 years ago. So why does this matter? Did poww make that sale? Did they get 5x the return or did the customer? Once the ammo is taken out of the manufacturers hands and into retail, they get nothing other than that initial order. They don’t dictate the prices at all. Same goes for guns. One popular concealed carry pistol might be easy to find in PA but not Montana. Guns go online and get auctioned off. So some smith ARs can fetch $1200 when it really should only be $695.00. But again, smith didn’t make that huge of a sale.”",reesemccracken,1,/r/stocks/comments/m1aia7/another_reason_to_look_at_poww/gqcku1n/,0.081,0.817,0.101,0.9139
946,SWBI," I kept thinking the same thing and I’m currently holding POWW and SWBI. Someone commented the other day to not hold your breath given his extensive experience. It goes against my basic understanding of the laws of supply and demand but experience is experience. The $30 in the comment below is in reference to SWBI.

956,GE," Sure it can def reduce account volatility. However it can also hinder on gains that you would have in the stock by itself which I’m sure your aware of.

With stock dwindlers like GE and F I have often sold CCs in the past to profit on a stagnant stock. I’ve made the most profit with CCs on high IV options though. 

For example, today with GME, if its IV was going to be very high, option mark price would be very high also. If GME goes down tomorrow, you can get a fall in IV and can make a killing writing CCs.

Also if the stock doesn’t reverse course and goes up you will still profit as well.

959,RH," From what I understand you pretty much got it right. Only thing is some brokers might wave the transfer fee since you have 5 figures. 

I just tried a partial transfer from RH to fidelity. It got canceled by one of them. ( I assume RH but they blamed it on Fidelity) also i had to apply for a margin account with fidelity. If you utilize instant deposits with RH they default your account to partial margin.

Also RH might freeze your account while the transfer is happening. They didn't do it when I tried a partial but again that was denied.
