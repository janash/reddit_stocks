""We believe the company continues to build its database of positive outcomes using the Hemopurifier. In addition to the outcomes noted above, AEMD is currently conducting an Early Feasibility Study (EFS) of patients with COVID-19, as well as another clinical study in patients with head and neck cancer. The growing database from these EUA patient cases and the clinical studies is expected to contribute to potential FDA regulatory approval. Moreover, the several beneficial outcomes noted with the two EUA patients also point to the potential versatility of the Hemopurfier, which could, in turn, also imply a growing commercial opportunity for AEMD. ""

Hemopurifier® benefits

➢ Successfully cleared SARS-CoV-2 virus from the blood stream of an infected patient.

➢ Successfully cleared associated exosomes from the blood stream of an infected patient.

➢ Patients tolerated Hemopurier treatment without side effects

➢ Lowered noxious exosomal microRNAs associated with coagulopathy and acute lung injury

58,IMO," ATOS. Huge sell off after good PR and at the same time analysts are raising price targets. 12 month targets are 7-8 range. Where else are you going to get 100% gain in a year. Also during a conference yesterday their CEO said they would be looking to Partner for their drug Endoxifen. This is a guy who has brought many other drugs to market successfully. A good long term investment IMO

- Drone Delivery Canada Corp. (TSXV: FLT) (OTC QX: TAKOF) (Frankfurt: A2AMGZ) or (Frankfurt: ABB.F) (the ""Company"" or ""DDC"") is pleased to announce that, with the assistance of its sales agent Air Canada (TSX: AC), it has been selected by the University of British Columbia (""UBC"") to deploy DDC's patented drone delivery solution at the Stellat'en First Nation, for UBC's ""Remote Communities Drone Transport Initiative"" program.

Drone Delivery Canada Corp. Logo (CNW Group/Drone Delivery Canada Corp.)
Drone Delivery Canada Corp. Logo (CNW Group/Drone Delivery Canada Corp.)
The project will enable defined-route deliveries utilizing DDC's Sparrow drone and its DroneSpot® takeoff and landing zones as well as additional drone flight infrastructure as required. The solution will be used to transport a variety of cargo for the benefit of the Stellat'en First Nation, located in the Fraser Lake area of Central Northern British Columbia, Canada.

DDC and UBC will work towards finalizing a definitive agreement shortly. DDC is expected to commence deployment of site infrastructure summer of 2021 and expects to begin providing drone delivery services under the agreement in the second half of 2021. The drone project term is expected to be 12 months. This deployment will be DDC's fourth First Nations project and its first in British Columbia.

All operations will be conducted in accordance with appropriate Canadian regulations. Flights will be remotely monitored by DDC from its Operations Control Centre located in Vaughan, Ontario.

""We look forward to working with Drone Delivery Canada and all partners on this project for the benefit of the Stellat'en First Nation. Many First Nations communities in B.C. are on lockdown to reduce transmission of COVID-19, which has exacerbated inequitable access to health care supplies and services, ranging from personal protective equipment and medications to laboratory services such as COVID-19 testing and diagnostics for other medical conditions,"" said Dr. Michael Allard, Vice-Dean, Health Engagement & Partnerships, UBC.

""Based on the isolated location of our community and the needs of our residents, drone transport may enhance our access to COVID-19 testing and medication without traveling and endangering other members of our community,"" said Chief Robert Michell of the Stellat'en First Nation, located about 100 kilometres west of Prince George. ""The futuristic potential of this initiative is exciting. With drone technology, there is so much you can do.""

""We are pleased that UBC has chosen Drone Delivery Canada as part of their 'Remote Communities Drone Transportation Initiative' at the Stellat'en First Nation. The UBC Faculty of Medicine is a recognized global leader and we applaud their initiative to embrace drone delivery to benefit First Nations communities. As an award-winning global leader, DDC is pleased with our continued business successes in the drone delivery industry,"" said Michael Zahra, President & CEO of DDC",Eatern-Republic5884,0,/r/pennystocks/comments/nwdvyd/the_loungedaily_plays_june_10_2021/h1amc3g/,0.005,0.885,0.11,0.9936

Bio stocks are risky and volatile but ATOS is a winner and my view is that their drug will be tested against other types of cancer too. 

I will post the following again for everyone which is interested and is “new” with ATOS: Cash in hand with no debt, inclusion and possible BO or partnership. For those thinking that 30-40$ price range is not possible I would like to remind them that Gilead offered 20B for a buyout recently for Trodelvy and I can consider this as a peak. 5B market cap or even 10B buyout offer is totally reasonable as if I remember Trodelvy covers about 10% of breast cancer types where ATOS drug covers about 62% if I am not mistaken. I changed my sell order from 40$ to 80$ because FOMO should be considered.",AllSeeingEye7,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/nwdvyd/the_loungedaily_plays_june_10_2021/h1a6auw/,0.095,0.768,0.137,0.6873
119,ATOS," Lot of misunderstanding flying around here. On June 25th the passive indexes will have to buy shares whatever the price *if they haven’t already bought them.* There may be a mass buy on the 25th, but these indexes will be buying shares up until then.

Full disclosure, I am holding ATOS at the moment, but I dont have a large amount invested there.",ImRunningOutOfIdead,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/nwdvyd/the_loungedaily_plays_june_10_2021/h19rka8/,0.03,0.877,0.093,0.4404

122,IMO," I held MITT for almost a year, about halfway through the pandemic ish they sold off a lot of their portfolio in order to stay afloat, they're not the same business now that they were then.

124,MITT," That's reasonable, are you currently invested in other REITs which you think are better (and would suggest)?
