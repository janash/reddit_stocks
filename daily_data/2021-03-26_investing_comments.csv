1. Kaltura has an IPO launching the 29th (Monday). It's a video conferencing platform integrated with Brightspace and other online learning systems that different universities use.

That said, their competitor is Microsoft Teams, which can be used as a stand-alone add-on. My university offers both, and I have tried both with my classes. Kaltura is more directly aimed at classrooms, with easy breakout group capabilities, hand-raising, plug-ins, etc. However, I find MS Teams to have a better video interface.

55,CLR," $CLR ... a great, undervalued Oil & Gas company

Continental Resources has a Float of only 58.24MM shares. However, the Liquidity is very excellent... 1MM-3MM daily Volume. CLR is purported to have the lowest Breakeven cost basis in the industry (\~$30/brl). With WTI Crude at $58+/brl, CLR should obtain a FCF windfall estimated at $1.B in 2021.  The company plans to use 40% of FCF to reduce LT Debt and then reestablish its Dividend. This should increase the $26/share price. When the Price of Crude was At this level in 2019, CLR shares sold in the Mid-$30's. IMO this stock should easily be $35/share today.  The immediate opportunity for reddit retail investors is to drive out the Short-Sellers that are artificially holding the price down and push the share price back up to its fair value range in the mid-$30's again.

(Option 1) With such a small Float, it should not take much demand buying to push up CLR’s stock price. A trading profit could then be made by selling the stock back to the Shorts as they are squeezed out and they run up the price as they stampede for the door.

(Option 2) Long-term investors could buy at a significant discount price today and Hold on to the stock while looking to the growth of the companies Revs & EPS as Biden’s Green New deal significantly pushes up the price of Crude to $5.00/gal plus.

The founder of CLR, Harold Hamm, is commonly known as the Father of Fracking. Harold Hamm has passed along the day-to-day running of the company and is now involved in searching out new opportunities for CLR. Harold Hamm owns about 80% of CLR stock and is NOT selling. CLR currently owns the drilling lease rights to some of the best producing property in the shales oil patches of OK and ND.

99,AAPL," Whilst I understand what you're saying and you are right to a degree, the market is FAR from unpredictable and there were clues of the massive rip towards the end of the day. From a technical point, there was bullish divergence on QQQ chart just before we ripped up showing momentum was building up. Also if you had a look at the options chain on SPY, you would have seen there was a lot of open interest for calls around the 395 level. Market makers like Goldman have it in their best interest to close out their book in green as much as they can (they are a bank after all) and so why could have happened is there was a lot of puts early in the session which the market makers would have to hedge buy buying the underlying. Same goes for people selling covered calls, MM's would be buying these up. Point is MM's likely moved the market up to their strike by buying stocks like AAPL that make up a large percentage of SPY (and an even larger percentage of QQQ) and this would not only make the puts bought burn but also lead people to covering their short position hence moving the market to their desired strike and cashing out big. This can further be seen as the more speculative tech stocks didn't close green whilst most large cap tech pumped into the close (they make up a bigger weighting of the indexes). Whilst I make no claims this is what happened for certain, I think this is quite plausible and would welcome any counter-arguments.",Nafan123,1,/r/investing/comments/mdkgaz/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gsc9odp/,0.021,0.9,0.078,0.9279

I don't personally think this is the case. I mean, companies making $ off gaming have been around, profitable, and public for decades now. It's not really anything new. That being said, if I had to pick one of your four areas to invest in, it would be gaming. But honestly, I would focus on whether these companies can grow their profits, not just revenue. Most companies are valued on a somewhat static basis, so the growth in the stock price tends to come from the marginal growth in profitability (even if that means less negative cash burn for certain growth co's). The change in profitability forces investors to re-price the security, which = $ in your pocket assuming its positive.

> As for auto, perhaps I should be investing in things that surround the industry, such as battery manufacturing and AI.

Just a tip / thought. Consider not chasing and piling into the same stuff every other new investor has been piling into over the past year. Investing in buzzword soup sold by wallstreet to retail investors is generally a bad strategy for generating returns. You're still not getting away from your very strong sector bias in technology.

I have been putting fund in Robert Ny Teknik A however since I put the funds, the value of the fund lost 8 % in 2 months. I know usually this is a long term fund (min 5 years) but when do you usually get out of funds if they do not perform really well and you basically lose money ? Or do you just stay there hoping next year will be better? I am kind of newbie in that and I chose this fund due to high return from last 3 years.

THis is the description of the fund : 

"" Technology is an actively managed equity fund that mainly invests globally in large and medium-sized companies in the information technology sector. The sector includes, for example, companies active in software, computer manufacturing, communication equipment, semiconductors and IT services.

128,IMO," Question about regularly investing:

* I can roughly put 1K each month in investing. I have a target of €8500 for each investment that I own. This means I want to put this much amount of my own money into each investment.
* Poker is a hobby of mine and I'm more interested into more money / ROI %, than spreading it safely, however I'm not an idiot, I have roughly 12 different investments where only 1 currently has €8500 invested in it, so if one goes completely down, I should still have others.

Should I:

* Put the full amount into one investment untill its up to €8500? This would provide me with more returns if it goes up, but could lead to missed opportunities on other investments which I currently have less money invested in.
* Split the amount in 2 or 3, and buy into three different investments. I can then put it in the ""cheapest"" investments at the moment, which would provide more ROI if those particular investments go up, but would give me less money since different investments have to grow simoultaneously and the amount invested is smaller
* Devide the amount through all my investments and buy them equally?

Advantage of the first option is that a single investment will be up to my target faster, but it would still take 8 months, growth in that particular investment would give me more returns. The second option would steadilly grow some investments faster than others, and the latter seems really bad IMO, a growth would not really be paired with a bigger ROI. The third options just seems really bad

Risk tolerance is high because I believe in time in the market vs timing the market. As long as I keep investing and re-investing, I hope my funds will grow long-term. For example, if we have another 2008, I'm going to pump more money in than I normally would a month. I can afford to do maybe 1-2K a month depending on controllable expenses.

I've invested most of my TSP into the C Fund = S&P 500, and S Fund =  Dow Jones U.S. Completion Total Stock Market Index, and made around 10K since starting 1.5 years ago. I currently max out my TSP of 19.5K/year along with 6K to my IRA.

Public student loans around 87K looking for PLSF. Crunching the numbers, it would cost much less for PLSF (I've done 3 years out of 10 at $0 payments due to low-income post-college and COVID exceptions) vs aggressively paying them off.

My goal is to keep my AGI as low as possible, for example, I invest my salary into my 401K and IRA, using my tax free disability to fill the gap. From my research, it looks like an ETF would be the right way to go. If that's correct, would any particular one be pointed towards long-term gains, and the most tax-advantaged?",NickBlasta3rd,1,/r/investing/comments/mdkfqs/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gsbhhmm/,0.077,0.831,0.092,0.5274
