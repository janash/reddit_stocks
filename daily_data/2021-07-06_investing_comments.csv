3,CF," From an investing perspective, there are a couple of ways to invest in a private company. 

If you have capital to lend to a small business, a small business which needs working capital may be interested in debt financing. I've done this twice with family businesses where working capital was needed for a short while for expansion. In this case, it was structured as debt instead of equity. For income based businesses, I would never want to participate in a equity investment since there is less likelihood of a liquidity event and price discovery can be subjective. 

Another way to have shares in a private company is to start your own company. Sorta an obvious answer but I thought that I would mention it since sweat equity and building your own business with partners, etc. can be great way to build wealth. And you get to learn a lot from the process.

But I suspect you are asking about investing in startup companies that have a potential liquidity event through a merger or acquisition or an IPO. In these cases, there are a couple of ways to purchase shares:

1. For late stage companies - usually VC backed businesses, there are secondary equity platforms such as Sharespost and EquityZen where you can acquire or dispose of shares.
2. Reg CF platforms are brokers that provide access to companies looking to raise capital and sell shares using SEC Reg CF and Reg A private placement rules. These are typically angel or pre-angel round investing. I don't personally believe in this type of investing but they do exist if you want to google those platforms.  
3. There are traditional private placement brokers - usually they represent family offices or small VC funds seeking to invest in secondary transactions of startups. These are not really options for most investors but could be a way to dispose of shares.  
4. If you have a relationship with a startup company, such as being an employee, your compensation could include incentive options. Or as an advisor or service provider where you may be compensated in shares. 

I have always acquired shares in private companies through method #4. Either I work for a startup and negotiate a chunk of my compensation with RSUs or options. And I will exercise those options to acquire the shares if I like the business. Also - I work with a lot of small startups through my business and I will sometimes accept options as payment for my some of my services if I really like the founders and their business model.  

Bear in mind that when investing in a venture backed startup, you could be taking on a lot of risk. Generally speaking, price discovery and liquidity will be a challenge.  And you are likely to only have access to common shares whereas the VC's will have preferences with their shares. 

So far - I've only ever had 2 successful exits out of 6 companies. The other companies have become insolvent or are staled businesses.",greytoc,1,/r/investing/comments/oeh9b5/stock_delisted_how_do_i_assert_my_stockholder/h48uiwd/,0.022,0.858,0.119,0.9937

 >Chinese provinces and cities have long been suspected of cooking their numbers, with the focus on local government officials, whose performance are often assessed based on how well their respective economies have performed. In recent years, China claimed growth numbers have come under increased scrutiny, with both domestic and international observers alleging the government has been inflating its economic output. Instances of overclaiming officially came to light when:  Binhai New Area in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin. Tianjin's trillion-yuan GDP claim for 2016 was in fact a third lower, at 665 billion ($103 billion).

My line of thought was that increased use of EVs will cut into the oils no matter what.

Fundamentally, there is no new technology required to make space highly accessible.  Whereas with the internet there was.  The physics of space flight means that the journey from the earth’s surface will always be propelled by a chemical rocket.  Hydrocarbons and oxygen.  There is just no other way to do it efficiently.

That said, 99.9% of the cost of launching rockets is not related to fuel costs.  The costs are procedural (range safety, launch tower access etc) and also related to the rocket hardware.  These two things can be practically eliminated with reusable rockets and scale.  This can bring LEO launch costs down to 10’s of dollars per kg which will cause the market to explode.

Consider that large satellite constellations are increasingly coming within reach, able to provide internet to the large number of people who live away from cities and towns.

Space is the ultimate 'killer app' for AI & robotics. Why confine AI & robots to the office, when they can work anywhere that human beings can't, whether at the bottom of the sea or out in the asteroid belt?

You have a cost-intensive, highly competitive industry where nobody really cared that much for a very long time. If you look at GM between Fall of 2010 and Fall of 2020 it really was pretty much flat. It's taken off lately because people hype anything EV related, but EV doesn't change the fact that the automobile industry is still a difficult, cost-intensive and highly competitive industry with a very, very (very) long list (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_defunct_automobile_manufacturers_of_the_United_States) of bankruptcies over the years - a list that includes GM.

Two main things will drop the price of CDS: increasing counterparty default risk (somewhat ironically), and decreasing underlying default risk (if the underlying obligation actually pays out after all, your insurance is worth nothing). I don't know the context of the scene in a movie that you're referring to, but there was a lot of uncertainty around the entire market, including both whether an investment bank that was short CDS would be able to make payments and whether the CDO would be bailed out by the government, in which case the CDS wouldn't be triggered.

Thousands of other customers suffered more than $7 million in losses due to similar mis-statements, FINRA alleged.

Between 2018 and late 2020 Robinhood also failed to properly supervise its technology, causing it to experience a ""series of outages and critical systems failures,"" including a major outage during the pandemic turmoil of March 2020, which led customers to lose money, FINRA said.""

""Robinhood's “option account approval bots” regularly approved red-flagged customers for options trading, even in situations when the company's own policies barred such approvals — like, for example, when the customers said they had a low risk tolerance.""

""Robinhood showed false cash balances to customers, sometimes showing negative balances that were twice the real balance. As recently as May 2021, the company was also showing inaccurate balances on accounts holding certain stocks to millions of its customers. Historical account-balance data was also false.
The statements made to customers about options trading were regularly false. For instance, the company falsely told Robinhood Instant customers that they couldn't trade on margin; it falsely told Robinhood Gold customers that they could disable margin trades; and it falsely told customers entering certain options trades that they couldn't lose more than they paid in premiums.""

The stock has probably dropped a lot recently because they didn’t give solid guidance for 2021 (sales growth this year is definitely not going to be as good as last). 

I assume growth in the next 10 years to be higher than GDP because the forecasted growth of ecommerce is higher than GDP growth in that period and Redbubble is also adding more artists, sellers and products to the website. In the past few years, they have spent AUD 8-9mn annually on CAPEX which is very small compared to their revenue which is AUD 620mn.   They also have a working capital of around 9mn AUD which i have not considered, as it would not make a significant difference.

The stock has probably dropped a lot recently because they didn’t give solid guidance for 2021 (sales growth this year is definitely not going to be as good as last). 

I assume growth in the next 10 years to be higher than GDP because the forecasted growth of ecommerce is higher than GDP growth in that period and Redbubble is also adding more artists, sellers and products to the website. In the past few years, they have spent AUD 8-9mn annually on CAPEX which is very small compared to their revenue which is AUD 620mn.   They also have a working capital of around 9mn AUD which i have not considered, as it would not make a significant difference.

Problems need to be solved through government policy, not by companies. Conpanies exist solely to profit. So they'll do anything in their power to do so.
