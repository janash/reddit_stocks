0,BABA," For anyone don't understand why it's happening now, it's because March 15 in China is an event that expose companies with shitty practice. It happens every year. It's been a events for many years. As a Chinese I can tell you it's very common that some big company get some small punishment during this period.

 I check the reason UC browser got deleted from app store is they advertise fake medicines(the drug promise lower blood sugar, or losing weight but it's all bullshit) and that's illegal in China. Not only BABA's app got deleted they are many other app got warning. Including 360(a big cyber security company), multiple job searching app, ford(transmission problem), Infiniti(transmission problem), Kohler, Max Mara(install face recognition camera in their store to analyze customer), and many other companies.

25,BABA," With analysis like that, wait until you discover how ETFs work.

Edit since this thread is locked so I can't reply:

/u/oarabbus ETFs represent a collection of several stocks (but not always an index see ARKK for instance), but owners of an ETF do not actually ""own"" any of the individual company shares composing it. Some institutions (not you) have the ability to convert between ETFs and underlying shares, but there's an important distinction between NAV and the current ETF price. For lower volatility ETFs, it's possible to over/under pay relative to the actual assets represented by that share. This is something that will never happen with a holding company such as BABA.

Further about BABA, it's understandable that some people are not comfortable investing in it or other Chinese stocks because they fear retaliation from the Chinese government. Generally this is the fear that US investors will be locked out or that China will nationalize these companies and thus invalidate every existing share. The important point here though is that BABA being a holding company has **ABSOLUTELY ZERO IMPACT ON THIS**. We're talking about unilateral action by the Chinese government, which can be carried out regardless of the shares being ""real"" or not. This can also theoretically happen in nearly* every country. If Japan decided they wanted to nationalize Sony, they could pass a law to do so. The (implied) risk is that China is an authoritarian, single-party government that has less barriers to enact such a law.

Now how likely China is to do this is up to interpretation. Nationalizing these private firms is a single shot revolver: they can only do it once before international investors completely divest from China. Moreover it's a single shot revolver aimed at their head, because cutting their businesses off from capital would permanently cripple all of them. Maybe China will enact such a law regardless, but I think it's quite unlikely given current conditions.

TL;DR BABA has risks but anyone saying it's because of the legal structure of the entity lacks critical thinking skills and should be disregarded completely for investing advise.

28,FCF," PE is a terrible way to value a tech company because if they are reinvesting everything then the ‘E’ is deflated and isn’t the true earnings power of the business. Sadly PE is the main focus in all of these threads.

Price to FCF is about 20 which is about the lowest it’s ever gotten to for alibaba. This is the actual operating $ it is throwing off. Amazon is ~50. 

~20 is also where Berkshire Hathaway is for example, which is not a stock you’d expect double digit growth from. 

Essentially, Alibaba is priced as if it’s mature and going to be pretty stagnant, but the Y:Y growth is tremendous. I don’t see much medium or long term downside risk here at current stock price unless you actually see China neutering the company entirely, and I don’t. It could easily be listed at double it’s current price and it’d be justifiable.

With so many companies with NO technology specific manufacturing expertise OR product available to sell (lots of companies with visions, maybe some smart people, and fat piles of cash). We have those companies' valuations comparing in some cases to legacy auto companies or whole divisions. And these are companies with beloved brands, and they have domain experience in manufacturing, servicing and selling vehicles. (**Note: they do not have specific technology experience though**). It is pretty mind blowing. There is going to be lots of hurt at some point, but I do feel I have a reasonably clear picture as to how this is likely to end up playing out.

A few important 'bits' of knowledge on the space that I view has helpful in framing any particular opportunity (feel free to do your own independent research on the validity of each of them):

* **Where are the batteries?** The biggest constraint and challenge for getting EVs sold into customer hands for **at least** the next 5 years, if not decade or more - is the answer to the question of: *where are you getting your batteries from? EXACTLY?* Which factory? When does it start its production? Is it a reputable tier 1, tier 2, or lower tier supplier? At what scale of this supply have they been promised? Pre-paid? Without any clear plan or answer on this, it is very much buyer beware for me. You can go into a rabbit hole on this one all the way to which specific metals will be needed. Note that in general, the mines or factories have not even had the shovel hit the ground yet. This is a race of industrialization.
* **EVs** **are significantly cheaper to operate, and have a cost structure that makes them attractive for commercial use, fleets, business use, and productive capacity.** A quick primer as to how this breaks down: higher upfront costs (50-100% more) BUT, that same piece of equipment can go 4-5x of the usage (EVs are million mile vehicles / 1.6million kms vs 150k miles or 300k kilometres for ICE cars generally). This means depreciation of the vehicle per mile can be in excess of 1/4. Maintenance, with dozens of moving components rather than hundreds, is also fractions cheaper. Energy to drive it is fractions cheaper too. So assuming you as an operator have 'charging' solved and a use pattern that can fit within that, this is fantastic and very desirable. No f\*cks about the environment given here.
* **Technology S-curves and how technologies products are adopted:** The first of anything you make is the hardest. Each following unit produced is easier. So the 1000th unit was harder and less profitable than the 100,000ths, and millionth, and so forth. This means that as you experience magnitude increases in units shipped, you get material decreases in unit costs. Its the same higher level phenomenon as the more known Moore's Law, that technology improvement is exponential. Where for Moore's Law we talk exponential growth in the number of transistors for a given 'consumer chip' or application, we are talking about the exponential decreases in costs of Li-ion batteries, and other associated technologies. Given this is exponential (and has historically not been projected as such) these cost declines will arrive much sooner than all the mainstream analysts expect. A good starting point for your own independent research, is to see how accurate historic predictions have been. (note, really really off, by really really underestimating progress).
* **Autonomous vehicles are, conservatively - the wildcard**. While its a whole topic on its own, once it comes about (whether in a 1 year as a Tesla FSD optimist or well over a decade by say the pessimists) it will radically transform the economics of transportation in general (both as users and providers) so this needs to either be understood, or treated as its own 'risk'.

Comments on your views on risks:

1. Agreed. Many of them are vapour. Must be very careful and cautious.
2. Agreed, selling (often commodity) equipment in industries with mature technology is a tough business. Autos have been a notoriously difficult industry to start and run a business in due to all the levels of complexity. This applies to **every single player**.
3. In general, and particularly in the medium term, this doesn't matter. The technology and products can stand on their own feet (unlike say, our two molecule friend) and market structures and incentives here I view more as fuel on a fire than support. The horse has left the barn on this one, can't put it back in. (see previous point on exponentially decreasing costs)
4. While valid in an immediate term and will cause resistance through the adoption curve, two things that I've seen being in the space: the infrastructure is actually complicated to building out charging is mostly standard, equipment - its mostly a question of capital (and therefore the math). Also, given that for residentially owned vehicles for personal use, the vast majority of charging will occur at the home. For fleets, in lots or depots where concentrated hardware can be utilized. Costs of building this out are high though and do not benefit with the same degree of cost curve declines as the vehicles. And for clean sources, like Wind and Solar - you would be surprised at how quickly they can be ramped up and put online. Solar in particular can be turn capital into energy producing assets (perpetually) faster than anything we have ever seen before. (Shale maybe, but its more of a burst rather than a long time trickle.) I do not see this as a constraint.
5. Agreed. That is why I don't think anyone who doesn't have the infrastructure already or the ability to create it (within the EV market specifically) to get to a point where they can generate positive cash flows, I assumed  it to be 'dead' in my books unless proven otherwise.

45,ICE," Point #4 does not hold water. EVs are far superior in clean energy/carbon emissions/saving the planet.

Fuel for ICE vehicles (gas) is 100% fossil fuels. About 60% of electricity is generated using fossil fuels. So that switch alone - even as it stands today - is a huge improvement. But it's not static, the percent of electricity produced by renewables has been steadily growing and will continue to do so - at an accelerated pace.

The key benefit of EVs is that the vehicles are decoupled from the energy production, so as electricity production gets better, the EV benefit improves, too.

(Even if electricity production is nearly all fossil fuels, say for a particular area, the generation of that electricity is cleaner at large power plants than burning gasoline in millions of small ICE vehicles.)",VegPhysicsDad,122,/r/investing/comments/m60b98/i_have_to_be_missing_something_about_the_ev_space/gr3cnab/,0.015,0.792,0.193,0.9733

51,IBM," It is like PC in the 1980s. A company called Apple could not compete with IBM. Its Mac did not sell well and mfg had to lay off a lot good people. Steve Jobs was fired once. I think there were 200 PC compatible and 50 hard drive companies. As soon as it became a commodity people find source from cheapest manufacturing source. There goes these 200 PC companies.

You are absolutely correct. These eV companies are tough to be profitable and many companies sell credits for a living.

I think there were 200 PC compatible and 50 hard drive companies. As soon as it became a commodity people find source from cheapest manufacturing source. There goes these 200 PC companies.

You are absolutely correct. These eV companies are tough to be profitable and many companies sell credits for a living.

53,GM," Generally agree bar 3 and 4,


3) Fair, but the main companies this argument are generally targeting a pumping money into expansion, if there's less profit expansion just slows, the actual margin per car can be quite impressive especially with software factored in. Conversely you don't see this argument too much in legacy business, farming.


4) Its still significantly better and gets better with time, whereas gas is pretty much bottomed out. The argument isn't invalid, but the numbers don't align with the sentiment, it should be positive.
There is also a real benefit in pollution being produced further away from people for health and QoL.


In addition you may be undervaluing software. Some of these companies have large, expensive, hyper-profitable software options, some dont. The bull case for a few of these companies is closer to ""selling drivers"" than ""selling cars"" past a point. This (in addition to parts of the electric drivetrain procees) is not a transferable skill from older car manufacturers.


There are wildly, wildly overvalued companies in the space though, you are completely correct in that.


I personally own a EV from a legacy company and I get most of the benefits from it just fine, the software component is just missing though and I hope to upgrade for that as soon as possible.

It still is better than ICE. The efficiency of an electric motor is much higher, as is burning fossil fuel in a giant turbine with 24/7 staff vs burning it in a small mobile ICE unit. EVs also last longer. Of course, it's even better when they're powered by renewables.

Ubers advantage over taxis was the convenience and the price, but again, they aren’t profitable, and if the price starts to climb people will go back to using taxis. At Ohare and Logan, the Uber/Lyft situation is a disaster, while the designated taxi areas run very smoothly. “But they’re working on driverless technology”, yeah, I see that becoming a situation where they’re paying someone $15 an hour to sit behind a wheel. Uber/lyfts best scenario is eventually licensing their apps to taxi firms to coordinate their fleets and licensing their driverless tech as “driver assistance” tech to a large automaker (if there are any left that haven’t developed their own by the time the idea dawns on them). 

Airbnb carries a huge liability in that they’re an unprofitable company that’s a few headlines away from becoming a side hustle too risky for their wealthy hosts. “Psycho axe murderer murders entire family during ski trip in aspen. Family was hosting him via Airbnb”, “Beach Bungalow Becky calls police when she sees black Airbnb guest entering her house”, “Winter cabin robbed by former Airbnber. ‘I knew no one would be there, because the calendar on Airbnb said they had openings and the host only uses it for Airbnb’ they say”

60,ICE," You need to improve your research. Here’s the short answers. 

1) Agreed things might be pricey but consider that total market cap of EV car companies may be greater than auto companies today. Personally, I think there will be 1 or maybe 2 winners and certainly a number of failures. 

2) Markets not saturated at all. You literally have 1 company that’s early in the success cycle and a handful of other players who might crack the market. EV penetration is at single digit percentages. 

Comparing it to the market today is pointless because EV’s disrupt the ICE market. Increased margins on sales, lower maintenance costs, autopilot, lower operating costs cumulatively make a big deal. Don’t overlook the effects of these because you’re overly focused on it being an EV. 

3) In the US, the current administration is more green friendly than the last. Credits will phase out but sales and profits are increasing and will be unnecessary. Tesla doesn’t need them today. 

4) I’m not sure why you think this. You don’t need to revamp the whole infra tomorrow. Just look at how Tesla has grown the charging network in the last decade. Not sure what you mean by saying the infra isn’t there. You literally just need power. It’s not complex to build a charging station. Also
Not sure why you assume it’s coal powered. The source of these can easily be solar or wind or natural gas. Look at the trends in power generation over the last decade. This is independent of EV growth. 

5) I’m not sure why you think this either. Why wouldn’t they be able to raise in a few years? Tesla has made the EV market highly attractive.

The thing we know for certain is that the world is looking at green energy and reduced emissions from automobiles.    Many countries have made motions towards EVs in the future between 2030-2050.

Tesla is leading the charge currently, I suspect VW will likely come in strong as dieselgate caused it to invest heavily into electric.   From my perspective all of the other big players are far behind or actively pushing other tech (hydrogen/gas/diesel/hybrid).

On handouts/tax refunds, they will drive the initial purchases, but I don't think that will matter as prices reach parity with ICE cars.

1. This is the crux, most EV companies will fold, or be acquired by more successful ones.  But the survivors will be giants. TSLA today could be MSFT in 2000, very successful, with a great future, yet wildly overvalued.
2. Agreed. However, if someone can figure out how to scale battery production (currently a bottleneck) then this goes far beyond cars. Electric buses, short range trucks (e.g. refuse truck, cement mixer, etc.) are much more attractive than cars.
3. In the short term tax credit are relevant. In the long term, however, the total cost of ownership for EVs are much lower. This is very attractive for fleet users. The higher capital cost is compensated by less maintenance, longer life, and cheaper energy. EVs have far fewer moving parts, more reliable engines, batteries that are already exceeding capacity. I wouldn't be surprised if EVs with 500k miles become the ""new normal"".

4. Many countries are moving away from fossil fuels, in primis China and the USA. This is a multi decade long process, so I wouldn't focus on the current electric generation mix. And even EVs powered by gas plants are far cleaner than ICE cars, since in a power plant you can put much bulkier and more efficient equipment, and large and costly pollution control measures.

3. In the short term tax credit are relevant. In the long term, however, the total cost of ownership for EVs are much lower. This is very attractive for fleet users. The higher capital cost is compensated by less maintenance, longer life, and cheaper energy. EVs have far fewer moving parts, more reliable engines, batteries that are already exceeding capacity. I wouldn't be surprised if EVs with 500k miles become the ""new normal"". And, while ICEs have reached technological maturity after a century of development, many key techs for EVs have lots of room for improvement.
4. Many countries are moving away from fossil fuels, in primis China and the USA. This is a multi decade long process, so I wouldn't focus on the current electric generation mix. And even EVs powered by gas plants are far cleaner than ICE cars, since in a power plant you can put much bulkier and more efficient equipment, and large and costly pollution control measures. The infrastructure is not a big issue (but the lack of willingness to invest in it is definitely an issue...). China has already shown how fast you can build the world largest power grid. We can incentivize charging EVs at night in order to smooth out the peaks, reducing the need for new infrastructure.
5. Agreed, this all comes down to political will. But I am not sure they need to built the infrastructure. After all, current car companies didn't built the infrastructure either.",canuckinfla,2,/r/investing/comments/m60b98/i_have_to_be_missing_something_about_the_ev_space/gr5e1jo/,0.037,0.81,0.152,0.9935

72,ICE," You definitely bring a good points to consider.

I think of it like this: there is simply not going to be enough market space for all of these same vehicle manufacturers to exist. There is going to be severe consolidation within the industry for a couple of reasons. 1. There are many more car manufacturers now but there are not an appreciably larger number of customers for those cars. 2. While some of the numbers and metrics are still early coming in, electric vehicles require far less maintenance and break down far less often than ICE vehicles, negating the need for as many replacement vehicles. 3. Eventually some of these companies are going to have to start turning a profit on vehicles in order to successfully stay in business as vehicle manufacturers (looking at you Tesla).",greatnate1250,3,/r/investing/comments/m60b98/i_have_to_be_missing_something_about_the_ev_space/gr39po6/,0.013,0.881,0.107,0.9072

Google?), party-limos since mini-fridges are easy to keep cold with EVs and drunk driving won't be a concern, probably a franchise for parking / cleaning / charging / maintenance of the MaaS fleet...?  someone will write an app to opportunistically combine the new transportation with last-mile logistics (like air-freight in passenger jets), and of course there's the larger shift from human truckers to autonomous semis (and related rejiggering of automated ports and warehouses, which is good business for some industrials I'm forgetting...)

Don't invest in the companies that didn't release cars? GM, tesla have the best ev track record rn and Ford released one recently. This is purely functionality. 

I agree with car companies being a tough industry. Especially if the economy is bad. 

I think there is a lot of government subsidizing for EV. Current administration sure, but if dinosaur companies like GM, Ford are going all EV that tells me they got a lot of reassurance by politicians. Governments have been bending over backwards to serve auto companies for decades now. Places like canada are also investing heavily in this area if that is a signal. Big auto is one of the few industries I expect will always get the benefit of the doubt by politicians. Up until now it was only tesla going big on EV, now it's 2 legacy american automakers and a heap of other startups. Not even counting foreign.

80,ICE, Point # 2 is interesting to me. I’d be interested in how the total market cap of all vehicle companies has changed recently. It’s not like people will bother owning an EV and an ICE vehicle.

81,ICE," If anything, I believe the switch to EVs would be detrimental to the car industry as a whole. 

First, when the legacy automakers eventually switch to EVs, they will just destroy all the startups due to their existing manufacturing capacity and economies of scale. People are all caught up in the Tesla hype, but automakers in Europe like VW and Renault have already been rolling out EVs pretty successfully, but you haven't seen their stock increasing tenfold in a year.

Secondly, as you mentioned, it's a low margin business, with most manufacturers' market cap being lower than their annual revenue. 

Thirdly, the R&D and retooling they will have to do to produce EVs will be an extra cost with no foreseeable benefit. They are forced by regulations to produce a new type of vehicle, which will not generate extra sales, but will simply phase out the ICE vehicles for which they have optimized their procedures for decades.

Fourth, the lower service costs of EVs (apart from batteries maybe) means they will lose the biggest revenue stream, which is aftermarket support.

1. The majority of players in the EV space have EV cars on the deck (Tesla, NIO, VW, GM, Ford etc), the ones who don't are the ones that are highly risky (in particular Nikola), but the Tesla story also shows that there are advantages to starting from scratch as well as disadvantages - the biggest one being the lack of legacy factories which will cost money to wind down

2. Yes. It is, and the US govt has several times bailed it out because it means jobs, however worldwide only the most efficient manufacturers will survive, and that means many existing ICE coys will fail or consolidate (Stellaris for example). Poorly run EV and poorly run ICE will both fail

For ease, let's just take Tesla as our example - I don't want to suggest we should all fan-girl Tesla, btw.

Tesla is an EV company which isn't an EV company. Tesla is a battery company, which provides much more room to pivot. On top of that, Tesla is an FSD company (if you believe they will get there eventually), which means they have a second tech to pivot on for all sorts of interesting use cases: warehouse transport, long-distance logistics, convoys, taxis, etc.

If you're just an EV company, you're fucked once the big car manufacturers pile in, and even more fucked once growth slows down or becomes zero-sum. Well, you'll at least be squeezed *hard*.

Long-term, I'm not even in favour of transport.

93,ICE," So yes, overall I would agree with you that automobile manufacturing is dog poop compared with other industries. Their high cost, lower margins, and dependence on an energy source based on liquified dinosaurs make it difficult to see a bright future for the industry as a whole. 

So why are EV companies popular right now?  It’s because people see a future with these companies. The biggest issues with EV right now are due to its dependence on grid electrical to provide “fuel” and they are way less efficient than ICE vehicles. So if they only built EVs, would I target them as an investment?  The answer is clearly “no”. So what kind of companies would I invest in for longevity?  Well that would be the ones developing and improving energy and efficiency that doesn’t rely on liquified dinosaurs. Companies developing battery and capacitor technologies, rare earth metals, magnetics, wind turbine technology, solar technology, power inverters, and methods to lower cost of ownership of said products. For a daily driver vehicle, I can see how ownership of solar panels, a large battery, inverter, and EV can make daily trips work on the power of the sun over a long term. Think about never having to put gas in a vehicle and running only on solar power. Leftover energy is then stored in the home and helps to power everything in the household.

 The car companies range from multiple 3 wheel options  single car or truck models up to Nio and finally Tesla for full range of vehicles not including work trucks, busses and long haul options.

What is fact is that all of the major EV contenders have partnered with one or another of the leading solid state battery researchers.

I'm looking at lithium extractors and processors and companies working on solid state lithium batteries, and parts manufacturers(power trains) as parts of the supply chain that really have nowhere to go but up.

There are also many charging companies ranging from home to commercial to networked. A huge network that isn't even public (Electrify America) is a result of Volkswagen's $2bil fine focused towards becoming more electrified.

99,ALL," It's so wonderful to finally see the post from a person with a bright head on their shoulders.  You have hit many key points, and are dead on in your analysis.  I have been trying to disseminate the same information to the market herd, myself.  EV is not the ""silver bullet"" the Tree Huggers and Chicken Littles of Climate Change believe it to be.  And yes, virtually ALL of the EV stocks are *significantly* overvalued.  EV stocks today remind me of the ""[DOT.com](https://DOT.com)"" (DOT.bomb) Hi Tech era of the late 1990's.  Valuations got so outlandish that eventually they could no longer support their nose-bleed highs.

Do not change.  Stay just the way your are.  You will do well and go far.  The world needs more individualistic thinkers like you!

I am in this boat too (full disclosure, I own RIDE stock).   


I fully understand not everybody can be a winner in the EV market; however, the gentlemen in the piston engine business have the muscle to make it happen too, and as the market evolves and diesel/gas engines are phased out in favor or Hybrids/EVs/Hydrogen, the major players can pull it out (and kinda HAVE to pull it out, since their survival depends on it).  


I also understand the ""cool"" factor. Sure, when people think of EVs they think Tesla, as we used to think Prius when we talked about hybrids. Will this leg into the future make things easier for Tesla? absolutely. Will this mean Tesla is going to be a major player in the years to come? I do not think so, and I'll explain why.  


Tesla went from 90 pre pandemic to 10x at one point in 2021. Now it's levitating around the 700 mark. Mind you, its current market capitalization is bigger than the biggest players in town (Ford/GM/Volkswagen); in fact, at current pricing the market is saying Tesla is valued as if he was producing and selling more cars than ALL OF THE OTHER car manufacturers combined...which we know is not the case.  


Also, Elon's antics play a huge role on what the stock price is at any given day (whenever he tweets, something explodes, sometimes alongside shrapnel). On Monday he told the SEC he was to be addressed as ""Technoking"" and Tesla went from 689 to 706. I also remind you all of his now infamous Bitcoin stunt (also highly unethical: buy 1B in bitcoit, tweet about it and wait for the thing to skyrocket? Nothing of all those things have anything to do with any fundamentals that can be objectively tracked and make sense at the same time.  


So today, Volkswagen goes up a bunch, and most EVs go down a bunch. That was unfortunate, but kinda made sense. If I have to put my cheques were my mouth is, Lucid is promising, but only on paper, Tesla is selling well, but I'm not sure well enough, and GM/Ford/VW will keep doing their thing alongside the Koreans, with money to back their EV projects up and a brand to make them sell.

105,GM," I think you’re right.

Here’s another: I have no reason to believe that F, GM, VW and the other power players bury their heads in the sand, and sit idle with 2030/35 goals. They might have a model at every price point by 2025. There could be some mergers and buy outs, but it’s hard to read 4 years from now - things change a lot over the course of a month. I just know the biggest car makers (inc. Asia, Toyota, Kia, etc.) aren’t working on a fleet of luxury petrol vehicles in 2025.

I think the autonomous part of EV is actually gonna be the game-changer for cars. The software/hardware in that field will soar. But it’s going to be a dense sector - everyone is piling in. Tesla is a safe bet IMO because it is basically a subsidized company. If SpaceX is any hint, Musk would probably love government infrastructure contracts for Tesla, from solar paneling buildings to buses to leasing tech to the defense industry.

Speaking in hindsight, but whatever company you lay your bets on, I’d research whether ownership and management are elite visionaries. If you went back to 99 and had today’s resources (ironically) to investigate Google and Amazon, might’ve been more of a no-brainer. Musk’s bitcoin sideshow is the one caveat, but he’s also proven.

110,GM," Yeah I agree that the market (broadly) is too hot since it’s a new sector. However, I do think the EV startups actually have a better chance of succeeding than many of the legacy automakers. Some legacy automakers will successfully transition, but they have so much baggage (non-integrated business model, dealership networks, thousands of employees with the “wrong” skill sets, factories with the “wrong” tooling, supply chains with the “wrong” materials, etc) that it will be very painful/difficult. I say this as someone who has worked for two very large companies in a related sector (like turning the Titanic to get change). 

Out of all the automakers, it’s looking like VW, Hyundai/Kia, GM, and Ford have the best chance so far (there may be other smaller players too). Many of the Japanese companies are not taking EVs seriously still and also have too much focus on H2 for cars which is vastly more inefficient/expensive. 

At the end of the day, I think Tesla, assorted Chinese EVs, and a handful of legacy automakers make it through this transition successfully. If legacy manufacturers want to improve their chances they need to hope for an opportunity to buy the more successful EV startups prior to explosive growth.",r3dd1t0rxzxzx,2,/r/investing/comments/m60b98/i_have_to_be_missing_something_about_the_ev_space/gr4381o/,0.0,0.772,0.228,0.9938
111,ICE," > EVs are significantly cheaper to operate, and have a cost structure that makes them attractive for commercial use, fleets, business use, and productive capacity. A quick primer as to how this breaks down: higher upfront costs (50-100% more) BUT, that same piece of equipment can go 4-5x of the usage (EVs are million mile vehicles / 1.6million kms vs 150k miles or 300k kilometres for ICE cars generally). This means depreciation of the vehicle per mile can be in excess of 1/4. Maintenance, with dozens of moving components rather than hundreds, is also fractions cheaper. Energy to drive it is fractions cheaper too. So assuming you as an operator have 'charging' solved and a use pattern that can fit within that, this is fantastic and very desirable. No f*cks about the environment given here.

This is why I strongly believe in Proterra ($ACTC) to be hugely successful.

Why? because there was a lot of deep ""black magic"" in the engineering and manufacturing to be able to make bright, colorful, sharp, reliable, etc. CRT tube televisions. Companies like Sony invented and perfected the Trinitron color system and there was a ton of engineering and tweaking to develop and make those at scale. Sure there were Chinese tube tv makers, but their products were pretty crappy and it was hard to master all the subtle aspects like geometry, analog tuner strength, etc.

Fast forward to the transition to flat-panel digital TVs. The Japanese led the way in Plasma and LCD panels but these were a lot easier to make and a HDTV manufacturer could just buy panels and chipsets and put together a workable TV. Most of the black magic has been eliminated from the basic design. They can put together a decent to quality HDTV just by assembling components. Now most of the Japanese electronic companies are out or close to out of the TV business.

EVs do the same thing to cars. With internal combustion engine vehicles, there's a lot of deep engineering magic behind getting the engines to perform, be reliable, etc. That's why Chinese car manufacturers have had a hard time moving out of their domestic market.

EV's remove most of that from the equation. The moat is now on battery and motor technology, which still has heavy innovation going on in US, Japan, Korea, but the Chinese battery makers aren't hugely behind.  EVs will make it easier to assemble most of the core parts of a car from battery and motor components and then the rest is sheet metal, suspension, electronics and leather, which are easy to improve upon.

Feels like buses have been largely unloved. Was hoping a few years ago that Proterra could have been publicly listed, but I see them as a positive example for where SPACs can help to enable financing of good companies to a wider, eager audience who want exposure.

Concerns I have regarding buses though, is by them not being as vertically integrated re: the battery supply question, I expect that they may have significantly more margin pressure and differentiation challenges compared to incumbents like NFI (who from my understanding, pitch themselves as drivetrain agnostic) who will probably be competing with suppliers on battery sourcing.

Plus (and here's the REALLY important part): that divide is getting wider and wider as EV and battery-production processes continue to improve at speeds way faster than ICE vehicle manufacturing can.

156,ICE," > What I've learned in the last decade is that all this tech people talk about (widespread EV adoption, self-driving vehicles, etc) is still way further down the road than anyone wants to admit

The mistake here is using past EV adoption to predict future EV adoption.  New technologies tend to be adopted much slower than people expect, until they hit a tipping point and suddenly adoption comes at break neck speed.

For example, CDs were invented 1982, but didn't surpass Cassette tapes until 1991.  Four years later Cassettes were less than 10% of the market.

Black Berry was launched in 1999.  10 years later, Smart Phones accounted for a mere 17% of the total market.  But, it only took 5 years after that for smart phones to take over half the mobile phone market.

So, what evidence do we have that we may be at the tipping point for EVs?  

* Past technologies have taken about 10 years of early adoption before accelerating.  Tesla has been around a little over 10 years now.

* In Europe (the leading EV market), EVs accounted for a whopping 11.4% of sales in 2020.  Strong environmental legislation from the E.U. has led to aggressive targets from E.U. autos to exit the ICE market entirely by 2030.

Tesla is currently expensive compared to ICE cars cause EV is still new tech, it will take a few years to make it cheaper like they already have with the Model 3, and soon a $25k model (probably a small hatchback). And those will also get cheaper as tech for it improves. When EV becomes the norm, Tesla may have some price advantage for not having to go through dealerships to sell their cars.

There's adavantages and cons to both ways, but I currently feel that the younger generations (the ones that will mostly be buying cars when cars all become electric), will prefer to do their own research and purchases online. Legacy automakers will have to someday cut off the dealers to be able to compete against companies like Tesla, and Tesla is already ahead in that department since that's how they been doing it.",Batboyo,1,/r/investing/comments/m60b98/i_have_to_be_missing_something_about_the_ev_space/gr4ll52/,0.013,0.919,0.068,0.7935

188,ICE," It's not my adoption rate, it's predictions by globally recognized analyst groups who's entire business is to understand and predict markets based on hard data. Feel free to disagree, though I'd be interested to understand on what basis you think you are right over the conclusions of an internationally recognized analyst group (IHS Markit). Again, can you please provide a source to your study?

Edit: Are you referring to the KPMG study? Because if so, you misrepresented it. Here's some key points from your source:

* It's a survey of 2000 people done using an online platform, we can assume this biases towards tech-literate people
* Of those 2000 people, about 1200 plan to buy a new vehicle in the next 5 years
* Of those 1200, 68%/800 are likely to buy a BEV or Hybrid; I'll note that hybrid demand is projected to increase much faster than BEV due to range, cost, reliability, cold weather performance and charging infrastructure concerns with BEV (\~20% market share by 2027, 30% by 2032)
* Of those 800, 42% will spend up to $50k on a BEV/hybrid, 20% up to $75k, and 31% want to spend less than $30k; so roughly 1 in 3 people in the market for a BEV/HEV want a car for a price that isn't realistic
* Of the 2000 surveyed; 1400 want tax or other incentives to purchase BEV/HEV which were dropped by Ontario so we're not likely to see those again, 1300 have concerns about reliability in cold weather, and 1500 people want a minimum of 400km range on a full battery which again suggests they will be disappointed with the options as this is the upper limit of BEV range in optimal conditions (better not run that heater or AC!)

Overall, of those that said they are interested in BEV/HEV, HEV meet their expectations if they can stomach the limited options and high cost. This study suggests to me these people will be disappointed with BEV options compared to their expectations.

It's easy to say ""I'm interested in BEVs!"" on a survey; I myself would have answered ""likely"" on such a survey but I'll speculate that until people are actually beginning the act of buying, most people aren't educated on the options and costs. I bought two vehicles in 2020 and both times looked first at BEV/hybrid but the options did not make sense for me. All BEVs had cost of ownership $10k+ higher than comparable ICE alternatives.",Nottighttillitbreaks,1,/r/investing/comments/m60b98/i_have_to_be_missing_something_about_the_ev_space/gr516cu/,0.024,0.917,0.058,0.8269

1) MSOs are heavily invested by institutions.  They transact on the OTC and these companies have clever ways to invest large lots of money through Skelton entities and do not have to report.  The big run up for MSOs started this past Summer. That was institutional investing.  You won’t see too big a difference on legalization. However, SAFE banking will make capital options more accessible.

2) Not all LPs are undervalued.  LPs are not nearly as far along as the US, and you’ve seen what the federal level will do to complicate the roll out as it did in Canada.  Cannabis has been recreationally and medically legal for much longer in certain us states.  That’s more time to navigate regulatory hurdles of that state.  Most of these companies literally just became EBITDA positive and are showing growth. The market is smaller in Canada, but they have a head start on federal alignment, international presence, and brand presence having been on major exchanges.  This is not insignificant.  Also, LPs are consolidating.  See the winners is becoming clear.  The Us is far from consolidation.

3) US MSOs will likely go in reverse for a while after legalization.  That’s what governments do to newly regulated industries.

224,TLRY," Your agenda is showing. Are you an #MSOgang pumper? There is a reason the LPs are outpacing...they thrive in a legal national market with reach across the Atlantic and into Mexico and South America. The MSOs have a huge mark-up due to very little competition and when legal, they will be forced to compete with one another for market share. They are priced fairly right now, imo, and will go up with hype and with acquisition (which continues to favor the Canadian LPs due to their reach and head start). I think MSOs are likely to see their currently strong earnings dwindle with legalization when the monopoly-favoring state-based laws come into conflict with federal legalization.

240,MSCI," That may sound correct but it's not. Even comparing non-tech US to international and US does way better.

**Christine Benz:** Hi,  I'm Christine Benz for Morningstar. As U.S. investors well know,  foreign stocks and foreign stock funds have underperformed U.S. for the  better part of a decade. Joining me to discuss the factors driving that  underperformance is Dan Sotiroff. He's an analyst in Morningstar's  Manager Research group.

Dan, thank you so much for being here.

**Daniel Sotiroff:** Hi, Christine. Thanks for having me.

**Benz:** Dan, let's just look at the level of underperformance of foreign stocks relative to U.S. How big has it been?

**Sotiroff:** It's  been pretty big. I think most people at this point are kind of aware  that--that dichotomy that exists between the U.S. and foreign markets.  So, to just put some numbers on it and to set the table here, the U.S.  market, if we're looking at March 2009, so the bottom of the financial  crisis, right up through last month, December 2019, the U.S. market, as  measured by the S&P 500, returned about 17.1% annualized. A huge  number, right?

**Benz:** Right.

**Sotiroff:** So,  sort of the comparable index overseas is the MSCI All-Country World  Index ex-USA. So, what that has done is about 9.9 percentage points per  year. So, you're seeing around 7% annualized return difference between  those two indexes. So, it's pretty large and understandably so. It's  what a lot of people have noticed.

**Benz:** Right. Definitely in our portfolios we've seen it too.

**Sotiroff:** Oh, yeah.

**Benz:** So,  let's go factor-by-factor. One that kind of jumped out at me and you  and I were exchanging emails about this, currencies. Is it the fact that  the dollar has outperformed relative to foreign currencies? Is that  part of the issue?

**Sotiroff:** So,  it is a component there, right. So, what we've seen over the most of  this period, this 10-plus years that we're talking, is the dollar has  appreciated relative to a lot of foreign currencies, the euro, yen,  pound, you name it. So, that obviously creates a drag on your foreign  stock returns. When you go to repatriate your assets from overseas back  to the U.S., the exchange rate is going to be less favorable in the  future than it was when you made those investments. So, it drags on.  It's part of it. But of that 7% delta that we were talking about, the  currency effect has only been about half a percentage point. So, you  still have another 6.5 percentage points to go to explain the gap there.  So, it's part of it. It's just relatively small.

**Benz:** So,  another factor that I think might be reasonable to think about would be  the sector composition of the U.S. market versus the non-U.S. indexes.  And so, let's talk about that. The U.S. tech stocks have been rocking  the house…

**Sotiroff:** Tech  stocks, right. You got the FAANG stocks and everything. They've been  really, really providing some tremendous returns, been driving a lot of  the U.S. stock market appreciation over the past decade or so. And it  seems pretty reasonable. When you go overseas, back into March 2009, the  starting point I referenced, foreign stocks were really kind of  dominated by financials and then you also had some materials and  industrials. It was a very different market composition over there. So,  it seems reasonable to suspect that market composition played a role in  it. So, we kind of tested that and we ran it through Morningstar's  attribution tool. And what we found was that sector composition was  actually a very, very small component of that return difference. Most of  it really came down to like what you would call just other factors. It  was U.S. companies just really broadly outperformed their foreign  counterparts pretty much across the board in every sector. So, there was  a component there. But again, it was very, very small, even smaller  than the currency effect that we were seeing.

**Benz:** So,  you're saying that it really owes to fundamental factors. And you're  saying that U.S. companies have performed better? Or has it been P/E  expansion or…?

**Sotiroff:** So,  it's other things going on. And you could probably frame this in a lot  of ways. One way we framed it when we were starting to dig into this is,  kind of like you're saying, there's other fundamental drivers, right?

**Benz:** Right.

**Sotiroff:** These  are actual businesses at the end of the day, and they have to earn a  profit at the end of the day. So, what we did is, we took the returns,  the total returns, from those two indexes and then decomposed them based  on the P/E multiples. So, we basically came up with two components that  if you add them together, you get the total return. So, that is, the  multiple expansion, which is how has price grown relative to the  earnings generated by that index. And then, you have EPS growth, which  is sort of like, basically how have you grown your profits over time.  So, when you add those two together, you get total return.

So,  if we break those two things down, what we see is that U.S. stocks and  foreign stocks performed very comparably in terms of multiple expansion.  They both expanded their price relative to earnings at about 6 to 6.5%  per year, which was kind of interesting. But then, when you got to the  EPS growth, that is where U.S. companies just blew away foreign stocks,  and it wasn't even close. Foreign stocks grew their EPS, earnings per  share, by about 4% per year. The number for U.S. stocks was a little  over 10%, I think around 10.3%, 10.4%. So, that's where you see that  extra 6.5% gap that I was referencing before. It was really at the end  of the day U.S. companies were just growing their earnings and their  fundamentals much more stronger than the overseas companies were.

**Benz:** So,  that really underpins that narrative that we hear so often is that the  U.S. emerged from the financial crisis stronger than most non-U.S.  economies?

**Sotiroff:** Yeah,  for sure. I mean, you could point to all sorts of reasons. I'm not  going to get into them now. Some of them maybe have more validity to  them. Some of them maybe more speculative. But yeah, for sure, the U.S.  has been incredibly strong, it continues to be very strong. To put kind  of a bow on this, though, I think, it's really--you have to come away  from this with, like, well, what does this mean for the future…

**Benz:** Exactly.

**Sotiroff:** So,  when you look at your portfolio now, it's like this in mine, because  I'm diversified internationally as well, U.S. stocks are kind of a  lion's share right now. And my foreign allocation has been dwindling  just because of the appreciation of U.S. stocks. So, this doesn't  exist--this isn't going to continue indefinitely. At a certain point,  things are going to turn around. I think if you go back to the  mid-2000s, you saw a pretty long period where we came out of the dotcom  bust and foreign stocks took off. So, this isn't going to last. These  things move in cycles. Currencies move in cycles. Foreign markets move  in cycles. You have to rebalance. You have to get rid of some of your  U.S. stocks and buy foreign stocks and be ready for when it turns  around. And we were talking before--you know, we've been saying this for  the better part of 10 years now, it's getting a little annoying. But  yeah, the prudent advice, I think is, rebalance and shore up your  allocations back to whatever your portfolio targets are.

**Benz:** Dan, terrific research, really interesting to me. Thank you so much for being here.

USA minus EAFE = 1.1% + 0.95 * change in valuation, R2 = 92.3% (1.5) (24.2)
It’s still a 1.1% victory (my first obvious guess for why would be some real earnings outperformance in the USA) but a significantly smaller (1.1% vs. 4.4% or 75% smaller) victory then just looking at simple returns",Erland_Brynjar,1,/r/investing/comments/m5zqnf/arguments_in_favour_of_more_international_stock/gr432dz/,0.0,0.979,0.021,0.3854
242,MSCI," That may sound correct but it's not. Even comparing non-tech US to international and US does way better.

**Christine Benz:** Hi,  I'm Christine Benz for Morningstar. As U.S. investors well know,  foreign stocks and foreign stock funds have underperformed U.S. for the  better part of a decade. Joining me to discuss the factors driving that  underperformance is Dan Sotiroff. He's an analyst in Morningstar's  Manager Research group.

Dan, thank you so much for being here.

**Daniel Sotiroff:** Hi, Christine. Thanks for having me.

**Benz:** Dan, let's just look at the level of underperformance of foreign stocks relative to U.S. How big has it been?

**Sotiroff:** It's  been pretty big. I think most people at this point are kind of aware  that--that dichotomy that exists between the U.S. and foreign markets.  So, to just put some numbers on it and to set the table here, the U.S.  market, if we're looking at March 2009, so the bottom of the financial  crisis, right up through last month, December 2019, the U.S. market, as  measured by the S&P 500, returned about 17.1% annualized. A huge  number, right?

**Benz:** Right.

**Sotiroff:** So,  sort of the comparable index overseas is the MSCI All-Country World  Index ex-USA. So, what that has done is about 9.9 percentage points per  year. So, you're seeing around 7% annualized return difference between  those two indexes. So, it's pretty large and understandably so. It's  what a lot of people have noticed.

**Benz:** Right. Definitely in our portfolios we've seen it too.

**Sotiroff:** Oh, yeah.

**Benz:** So,  let's go factor-by-factor. One that kind of jumped out at me and you  and I were exchanging emails about this, currencies. Is it the fact that  the dollar has outperformed relative to foreign currencies? Is that  part of the issue?

**Sotiroff:** So,  it is a component there, right. So, what we've seen over the most of  this period, this 10-plus years that we're talking, is the dollar has  appreciated relative to a lot of foreign currencies, the euro, yen,  pound, you name it. So, that obviously creates a drag on your foreign  stock returns. When you go to repatriate your assets from overseas back  to the U.S., the exchange rate is going to be less favorable in the  future than it was when you made those investments. So, it drags on.  It's part of it. But of that 7% delta that we were talking about, the  currency effect has only been about half a percentage point. So, you  still have another 6.5 percentage points to go to explain the gap there.  So, it's part of it. It's just relatively small.

**Benz:** So,  another factor that I think might be reasonable to think about would be  the sector composition of the U.S. market versus the non-U.S. indexes.  And so, let's talk about that. The U.S. tech stocks have been rocking  the house…

**Sotiroff:** Tech  stocks, right. You got the FAANG stocks and everything. They've been  really, really providing some tremendous returns, been driving a lot of  the U.S. stock market appreciation over the past decade or so. And it  seems pretty reasonable. When you go overseas, back into March 2009, the  starting point I referenced, foreign stocks were really kind of  dominated by financials and then you also had some materials and  industrials. It was a very different market composition over there. So,  it seems reasonable to suspect that market composition played a role in  it. So, we kind of tested that and we ran it through Morningstar's  attribution tool. And what we found was that sector composition was  actually a very, very small component of that return difference. Most of  it really came down to like what you would call just other factors. It  was U.S. companies just really broadly outperformed their foreign  counterparts pretty much across the board in every sector. So, there was  a component there. But again, it was very, very small, even smaller  than the currency effect that we were seeing.

**Benz:** So,  you're saying that it really owes to fundamental factors. And you're  saying that U.S. companies have performed better? Or has it been P/E  expansion or…?

**Sotiroff:** So,  it's other things going on. And you could probably frame this in a lot  of ways. One way we framed it when we were starting to dig into this is,  kind of like you're saying, there's other fundamental drivers, right?

**Benz:** Right.

**Sotiroff:** These  are actual businesses at the end of the day, and they have to earn a  profit at the end of the day. So, what we did is, we took the returns,  the total returns, from those two indexes and then decomposed them based  on the P/E multiples. So, we basically came up with two components that  if you add them together, you get the total return. So, that is, the  multiple expansion, which is how has price grown relative to the  earnings generated by that index. And then, you have EPS growth, which  is sort of like, basically how have you grown your profits over time.  So, when you add those two together, you get total return.

So,  if we break those two things down, what we see is that U.S. stocks and  foreign stocks performed very comparably in terms of multiple expansion.  They both expanded their price relative to earnings at about 6 to 6.5%  per year, which was kind of interesting. But then, when you got to the  EPS growth, that is where U.S. companies just blew away foreign stocks,  and it wasn't even close. Foreign stocks grew their EPS, earnings per  share, by about 4% per year. The number for U.S. stocks was a little  over 10%, I think around 10.3%, 10.4%. So, that's where you see that  extra 6.5% gap that I was referencing before. It was really at the end  of the day U.S. companies were just growing their earnings and their  fundamentals much more stronger than the overseas companies were.

**Benz:** So,  that really underpins that narrative that we hear so often is that the  U.S. emerged from the financial crisis stronger than most non-U.S.  economies?

**Sotiroff:** Yeah,  for sure. I mean, you could point to all sorts of reasons. I'm not  going to get into them now. Some of them maybe have more validity to  them. Some of them maybe more speculative. But yeah, for sure, the U.S.  has been incredibly strong, it continues to be very strong. To put kind  of a bow on this, though, I think, it's really--you have to come away  from this with, like, well, what does this mean for the future…

**Benz:** Exactly.

**Sotiroff:** So,  when you look at your portfolio now, it's like this in mine, because  I'm diversified internationally as well, U.S. stocks are kind of a  lion's share right now. And my foreign allocation has been dwindling  just because of the appreciation of U.S. stocks. So, this doesn't  exist--this isn't going to continue indefinitely. At a certain point,  things are going to turn around. I think if you go back to the  mid-2000s, you saw a pretty long period where we came out of the dotcom  bust and foreign stocks took off. So, this isn't going to last. These  things move in cycles. Currencies move in cycles. Foreign markets move  in cycles. You have to rebalance. You have to get rid of some of your  U.S. stocks and buy foreign stocks and be ready for when it turns  around. And we were talking before--you know, we've been saying this for  the better part of 10 years now, it's getting a little annoying. But  yeah, the prudent advice, I think is, rebalance and shore up your  allocations back to whatever your portfolio targets are.

**Benz:** Dan, terrific research, really interesting to me. Thank you so much for being here.

**Sotiroff:** Thank you.",Nemarus_Investor,2,/r/investing/comments/m5zqnf/arguments_in_favour_of_more_international_stock/gr4q4ir/,0.016,0.853,0.131,0.9994
243,AI," Sure valuations will come back. I think suddenly, after exploding for the next year or so (and I will buy that dip all the way down). But valuations of desirable companies can stay stretched for a very long time, while valuations of undesirable companies can stay depressed for a very long time.

262,RSI," The EUR/USD is moving higher this morning. If it can break and close above 1.20 I’ll be more inclined to buy and hold long positions in stocks and silver. Other commodities and bitcoin are not investable for me personally until they correct, or have a long sideways consolidation.

In addition to the EUR/USD I’m also watching high yield debt (HYG & JNK). These both showed signs of coming out of their corrections by closing above the 10DMA, but they moved back below it the next day. The fact that these are struggling makes me think this correction is not over, despite the action in the S&P and Dow.

**Stocks** 

The S&P 500 is hovering just above its February highs and is just shy of 4,000. I won’t be surprised to see it reach 4K today or tomorrow before the FOMC meeting. I’m curious to see what happens after that. I plan to be mostly on the sidelines for that announcement as any mention of a future rate increase could scare the market. It could also unleash the bubble higher if more dovish measures like YCC are announced. I can’t predict what will be announced so I’ll likely choose to get back into positions Thursday morning at earliest. I want to see where the week ends. Missing a little bit of the move is not a big deal. If a final bubble is about to begin there will be plenty of room to run for weeks.

I’m also more interested in tech stocks, semiconductors, and genomics than I am in travel and financial sectors. Tech is making progress from last weeks lows, but it is still not coming out of the correction as quickly as I would like to see. More sideways chop or a move back down is likely needed before a trend higher starts.

**Silver** 

Gold and silver have looked positive to start of the month. I still doubt a move for silver above 30 is imminent so while I may take some day-trade positions in silver I don’t plan to hold them for more than a day or two. Like stocks, I want to see where silver ends the week. My feeling is it is still stuck in this range and in the short term the risk of the next big move is still lower, not higher.

**Oil** 

In a past post I mentioned oil’s price was diverging from RSI. I thought that trend was breaking but it still appears to be in tact. I don’t recommend shorting but will continue to say if you own long positions in oil or oil services it is a good time to take partial profits and raise stops. Oil could just keep rising to 70+. It is much less predictable than other stocks and commodities. Current signs are consistently telling me a pullback is likely near.

273,GME," Could the argument be made that book value is no longer a reliable factor for value investing?

Historically, pretty much every business takes tangible assets to produce income. A manufacturing company needs valuable machinery and plants to produce goods. An airline needs aircraft to provide their services,A retail store has inventory, distribution facilities, and physical storefronts required to sell their goods, a car rental company requires a large fleet to produce income, etc.

Nowadays, many of the most profitable companies profit off of their intellectual property rather than physical assets. Whether it's a tech company like Microsoft selling their software, or an entertainment company like Disney profiting off of their films, the value of these things aren't captured properly in book value.

I've been wanting to get into value investing due to higher historical returns, but I found that index funds are too slow to respond to fluctuations in price(Vanguard's VBR still holds GME and Novavax even at inflated valuations), and also place too much emphasis on book value. 

For example Carnival corp looks like a value stock, with price/book ratios quite low compared to the market. But that's simply because they possess expensive cruise ships, a highly illiquid asset that they almost certainly struggle to sell, that they haven't been able to utilize to produce a profit.",skilliard7,1,/r/investing/comments/m64qhe/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gr5bvgd/,0.037,0.76,0.203,0.9848

276,PLTR," I'm not a professional advisor or analyst, but I'm astonished with the share price suppression that seems to be going on with Palantir (PLTR) lately.  I have not done a deep analysis in competition, but one example is Alteryx.  

Alteryx also provides products for software analytics and data science.  They appear to have had $495m in revenues in 2020.  The share price has been ""hammered"" by the tech sell down but still hovers around $90.  And that's approximately $50 discounted off the 1 year target price of $145.

By comparison, PLTR is stuck at $26.50ish with a target of $26 (target info from Yahoo!Finance).  PLTR had over $1b in revenues in 2020.  They have government and commercial sides to their business.  They signed new contracts recently.  

Hello??? How in the world does a company with more than 2x the revenues of a competitor trade for a quarter of the price?  Quick searches suggest this is a similar story looking at other big data firms.

319,PDT,"  I  am wanting to know more about how margin works. I have a margin PDT  account so over $25k of value + cash holdings and want to really  understand how the settling part works.

Say  I have some cash value over $25k in my brokerage account, example $30k  (I have more but will use $30k for this post), and no holdings of  securities either margin-able or non margin-able. My understanding is if  I buy up to $30k worth of any security either it be margin-able or non  margin-able ones then I won't be borrowing on margin as long as I don't  buy more than I have in cash. I do know that it's about the sell side  that things matter for this.

As  for the settling side of things. If I have all cash and no security  holdings, I can buy and sell as much as I want on one day up to my  pattern day limit, but if I sell more than what I have in cash holdings  or what I profit then I will essentially be borrowing?

If  buy margin-able securities up to $1 below my cash holdings on Monday  and then sell all of it on Monday do I need to wait for two days for the  trade to settle without borrowing whatsoever if I buy again on Tuesday?  Example for if no matter if I profit or loss as long as my $25k equity  is held can I: Everyday buy margin-able securities of $1 less than what I  have in cash and sell within that day and do it everyday repeating  after that without worrying about the 2+ day settling time or borrowing?

Example 1)

This  is all assuming I buy $1 less than my cash holdings value everyday and  sell within the same day and profit $100, if I loose money value on  those trades each day then my starting buying power lowers and cash  value lowers for buying the next day of course, but for this I profit  $100 a trade. $30,000 starting value. Starting Day Trade buying power =  $100,000 lets say.

Monday: Buy $29,999 worth of VOO and sell. Profit $100.

Starting Day Trade buying power increases. Tuesday: Buy $30,099 worth of VOO and sell. Profit $100

Starting Day Trade buying power increases. Wednesday: Buy $30,199 worth of VOO and sell. Profit $100

Starting Day Trade buying power increases. Thursday: Buy $30,299 worth of VOO and sell. Profit $100

Starting Day Trade buying power increases. Friday: Buy $30,399 worth of VOO and sell. Profit $100

Repeat..

So  my question(s) here are: Will on Wednesday I start to be borrowing on  margin after that? Or, do I not borrow on margin at all and not need to  worry about settling time whatsoever because 1) I buy once that day and  sell the same day with less than my cash holdings and 2) the security is  margin-able?

**Edit, disregard the above paragraph**:  So my question(s) here are: Will on Tuesday I start to be borrowing on  margin and after that until Wednesday when my trades settle and then  when Wednesday hits I not borrow on margin because the rolling 2 day  settling time has caught up from Monday and keeps settling each day  after Wednesday? Or, do I not borrow on margin at all and not need to  worry about settling time whatsoever because 1) I buy once that day and  sell the same day with less than my cash holdings and 2) the security is  margin-able?

Example 2)

This  is all assuming I buy $1 less than my cash holdings value for every  trade up to my day trading buying power and sell within the same day and  profit $100 per trade, if I loose money value on those trades each day  then my starting buying power lowers for the next day of course and cash  value lowers for buying the next trade of course, but for this I profit  $100 a trade. $30,000 starting value. Starting Day Trade buying power =  $100,000 lets say.

Monday: Buy  $29,999 worth of VOO and sell. Profit $100. Buy more VOO up to $30,099  and sell. Profit $100. Buy more VOO of $30,199 and sell. Profit $100.  Buy more VOO of $9,702 ($100k - $1 - $29,999 - $30,199) = $9,702. Day  trading used is $99,999.

Repeat  for Tuesday.. and so on with my beginning day trade buying power  increasing each day, as well as each of my buys of VOO $1 less than my  current value at the time.

So  my question(s) here are: Will on the second trade of Monday I start to  be borrowing on margin after that? Or, do I not borrow on margin at all  and not need to worry about settling time whatsoever because 1) I buy  less than my cash holdings each time and 2) the security is margin-able?  or am I borrowing on margin because 1) on the second trade on Monday my  cash I have is used on the sell side the first trade is up to $1 less  my cash holdings. So my second buy of $30,099 and sell for profit is  margin borrowing of $30,099 and interest added? Repeat up to my day  trading power for that day.

Edit:  How does settling time affect this example?, do I borrow on margin after  my first trade on Monday until Wednesday when my first trade from  Monday settles?, so margin buying until Wednesday.   Or am I given  monies by the brokerage to cover my cash value for each trade ($1 less  than cash value when buying/ selling) until my trade settles in 2 days,  then monies are moved around to balance it out, essentially always not  borrowing on margin this way if I always buy and sell each trade with  less than my cash value equity for my account?",travelseeker1,1,/r/investing/comments/m64pxi/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gr4q7v2/,0.026,0.818,0.156,0.9991
320,AMC," I'm having trouble understanding spreads and when to close out.  Yesterday, I bought a put debit spread on AMC, bought 13.5p 3/26 and sold 13p 3/26 for 0.34.

321,RH," Is Robinhood good for expats wanting to invest in ETFs for retirement?

Hey everyone, 

I’m totally new to investing and honestly not very interested in it either. I just want something easy to use and to invest in ETFs for retirement. I’ve lived a few years abroad and I’m going back this year after being stuck in the US due to COVID, so my retirement options are super limited and it seems like it’s just getting worse every year with brokerages. Ideally, I’d start a Vanguard retirement account but I’m not willing to take the risks of them finding out I teach abroad. I’ve been doing some research and started an account with Interactive Brokers but their app is super complicated and I read something about having to have a minimum of $10,000 to get started. I think I may just have to call them and see if that’s really true with what I’m wanting to do. I’ll have about $4000 to rollover from a teacher pension plus maybe a couple thousand dollars saved this summer so not even close to $10,000

Anyway, I’ve read that Robinhood allows investing in ETFs and seems expat-friendly, at least for now, but the consensus seems to be that Robinhood is an inferior option for long term retirement investors. Can someone explain to me why this is? From what I can tell, investing in, let’s say the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF should be about the same no matter the brokerage I use, be it IB or RH as long as costs are low for both. Is there any reason why my return rate would be significantly less with Robinhood rather than any other broker since most ETFs average about 7% for return ? 

Again, I’m not very knowledgeable at all about this stuff so bear with me. I just like the simplicity of Robinhood so willing to start an account with them as long as results will be about the same as any other brokerage.

323,ABC," In my experience, economic news varies in quality over time as ownership changes, editors turnover, and writing staff move to other outlets.  This happens even with marquee names like the Wall Street Journal.  You could take a look at the news sources provided by your broker to see if there is anything good for you.  The news does exist but you will need to regularly add new sources and drop old ones (e.g. became too political).  

Side comment.  As a new investor you might consider ETFs / mutual funds while you learn the ropes.  There are literally hundreds of them available and you can enjoy the benefits of diversification while avoiding strikeouts based on a single bet.

329,TBB," 

With respect to common stock, the stock price is not a direct function of dividends, but it is indirectly a function of earnings and thus profit.  So if profits were high, the share price may be driven up but so too is the dividend payout.

But there's also the precondition that for common stock dividends to be paid out, preferred stock dividends are paid first.  In most cases modern investors want common stock because it carries voting rights and a variable but higher dividend.  The preferred shares carry no voting rights and a lower dividend calculated after the company's income taxes.  However, this dividend is fixed for the life of the preferred share class.  A company can elect to defer dividends but the common stockholders won't get paid dividends until the preferred shares dividends are paid out first.

I have a situation where I sold T and replaced it with TBB because while I have confidence in the scale of AT&T's competitive moat, I'm not 100% sure that, as underpriced as T is, shareholders will drive the stock price up substantially in the near term.  So, I decided to purchase 500 shares of TBB.   If the preferred shares rise in price, I can sell them.  If they don't, I'm guaranteed a 5.5% payout ratio for as long as I hold the stock.",th3cr1t1c,4,/r/investing/comments/m6iaod/dividends_and_performance/gr5wuro/,0.046,0.807,0.147,0.9722
330,NAV," Well there's two things to think about.

A company/ETF that advertises itself as a dividend company/ETF and markets itself to investors as that will want to keep it's dividend constant regardless of market performance.

What can happen in that case is they maintain the dividend, but their share price drops, because dividends aren't free money - they come from the balance sheet.

The other option for them is to cut the dividend when it's unsustainable.

An ETF/company may also instead focus on keeping it's yield constant, rather that the nominal amount. As the share price goes up, the yield stays the same but the amount goes up, and if the share price goes down then the dividend will be cut so the yield stays the same.

The last thing you want to watch out for are high yield funds that promise great dividends - like 10% or more.

What most likely happens is they use the increase in stock price to payout almost all of the gains as distributions. In a bear market what happens is they raid the NAV to keep paying the high dividend, causing the NAV to plummet - eventually the fund closes cause all the money is gone.",095179005,3,/r/investing/comments/m6iaod/dividends_and_performance/gr5uxt9/,0.04,0.822,0.138,0.9617
