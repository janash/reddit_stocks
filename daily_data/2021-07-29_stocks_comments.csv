0,DD," This is some quality content about Trevor Milton and and all his failed projects. I have watched this multiple times because it’s funny as fuck. 
It should be also a reminder that you always have to do your own DD.

3,ICE," I don't see any issue making reliable EV drivetrains for trucking. The industry for highly reliable electrical motors is already there and has been for decades. The auto industry will just need to leverage components and design experience from the warehousing, manufacturing, and infrastructure sectors. EV's also drastically reduce complexity. A typical EV will have roughly 20 moving parts vs thousands in an ICE. In fact, it's entirely likely that vehicles built on EV technology will require zero routine maintenance or repairs for the life of the vehicle.

The big caveat to all this though is what happens if there is an issue due to damage, manufacturing defects, etc... Like you said, repair shops are littered along the major trucking routes so that you're never more than a hours drive or so from a place that can get you up and running again. I doubt this will be feasible for EV batteries due to how complicated storage and repairs will be.",deelowe,3,/r/stocks/comments/otxa0e/us_prosecutors_charge_trevor_milton_founder_of/h6ytysl/,0.052,0.933,0.015,-0.7096

73,GME," Don't worry, I thought the same thing when I first started learning about the GME saga. 

Puts are option contracts. You buy a put at a strike and expect the underlying to fall towards that strike by the expiration date. Best case scenario - you make a really tidy sum if the stock falls hard. Worst case scenario - you thought wrong. And the stock ends up big. Luckily, your losses are limited to the option premium you paid. 

Shorting:

You borrow shares from your broker on margin. Usually you are paying some interest for borrowing the shares. The broker sells these shares and you pocket the credit. If you are right and the underlying falls, you can choose to close your short position by buying-to-cover. More the price falls, cheaper the price is to cover and hence larger the credit (profit) you get to keep. 

But...if you guess wrong and the underlying skyrockets. Now you are under pressure and panicking. Do you wait some more time and maybe it falls again? What if it keeps going up? AND ADD TO THAT - you still have interest being charged from your broker on these borrowed shares. Keep waiting for it to fall or cut your losses and buy-to-cover at a price higher than what your credit was for selling. That's why shorting is dangerous and can lead to unlimited losses...while options are limited to the premium you paid. 

Hope that was helpful. Let me know if you have any more questions.",putsonbears,22,/r/stocks/comments/otm5c9/robinhood_ipo_prices_at_38_a_share_at_the_low_end/h6wzrpt/,0.125,0.741,0.134,0.6774

Now since it’s already hit close to 100 maybe it goes past that this time but I just had second thoughts that I might miss out on the gains like I did not too long ago. I don’t think I’d buy AMD at its current price and be confident enough with it.

If you liquidate, you can wind up waiting on a dip that never comes...and miss out on gains.

With billions of users, many of whom spend hours a day on the platform, they could have made Facebook Messenger the de facto email/messaging platform and truly provided a serious competitor to gmail, hotmail, yahoo mail, etc. Instead, they released a toy messaging tool. Didn't stop them from hyping it up beforehand. They led us to believe messenger was going to change the communications world (a la Slack).  


They added web search capabilities to their existing search, but if they had truly done it right they might have pulled significant market share from Google.  Might have even threatened to become the market leader.  Instead, the web search results got ignored because they were so weak and therefore nobody used it for web search - they kept going to Google instead. Now the web search appears to be gone altogether and you just get results from Facebook itself.  


They added Facebook marketplace. Another joke. Could have competed with Amazon, Google Shopping, etc.  


Facebook has a platform that is ubiquitous and heavily used, and yet they don't even realize they could leverage that to truly threaten the big players like Google, Amazon, etc., and expand into those markets in a big way.  


No boldness, no vision, just do things small and play it safe. Even if they're afraid of running into anti-trust issues, they could still be a lot more aggressive in these areas.

If it were to grow into its valuation and maintain a 70-80ish forward PE with similar 40-50% earnings growth guidance into next year, you could see the stock price go up 50% easily.

I'm saying its minimal risk because the companies balance sheet is rock solid, stellar. And name recognition is off the charts.

They're developing into a b2b communications suite company, when companies are looking to transition away from on-premise communications networks, and to off-premise dispersed cloud, in-line with todays hybrid work-from-anywhere model.

They’ve honestly flourished in their transition to greater online sales. Online sales now account for over 60% of all sales and have consistently beat expectations. I held through the run up and I’m still holding, especially for back to school season and for a massive box office year that brings foot traffic to the mall with Fast and the furious, Batman, bond 007, top gun ... the mall where I live is back to full capacity and if anything, JWN will no doubt return to expected capacity but continue to raise guidance. People who see JWN as a Sears type brand need to read up on just how dominant their online sales presence is right now. I truly think JWN is emerging in a much stronger position post pandemic, while putting on a e-commerce tour de force right now. Just wait until back to school season..

301,NIO," Hey man best advice I can give you is to get a job. You need to look at earnings in percentages so if you have a $100 you will need a 300% gain. That is very hard to get safely. Ofcourse there are instances where people do such things but they are willing to go from $100 to $0 in a blink of an eye and are ok with a 2% or a 4% chance of tripling their money. 

What you should do is get a job and invest every penny you earn. I started when I was 17 and had $1000 to my name then covid happened, I went and got a job at chipotle and earned about 12k. Over the period of one crazy year and a few mistakes and risky trades here and there I scored big on BJs (US store)  in October and then right after that I hit a home run with NIO (Chinese EV) I'm currently up 60% or so.

If I had $100 that I invested with I would now have $160. Typically people who play it safe make about 5% to 8% in a year or $5 or $8 if they started with $100. 

Definitely start investing but expect to make costly mistakes at first.

In regards to earning a phone you can collect cans or mow lawn. Will make money quicker than the stock market. Each can is 5c so you will need 6,000 cans to reach $300 or about 30 lawns. 

Lawns are a great business btw get a truck at 16 and start a company. Some lawns go up to $300 and mulch jobs can go into thousands.

343,DD," So what you're saying is ""as long as the stock doesn't go down, I don't  lose money""

I'm not a daytrader and not a big fan of it, so I can't give you a lot of advice. My only advice is - take fees, commissions and taxes into account. Those can really screw you over if you're very active.

I'm Europe-based, and my broker charges 6 to 15€ per order, so the amount you have to use for anything other than ""buy and hold"" is a significant one - so also ask yourself if you'd be comfortable with having that amount tied up with that certain stock for the long term.

My philosophy is that if you've taken the time to do a proper in-depth DD and determined a good target you're confident in, you should be in it for the long-term.

If you can get a company at $40 and expect it to reach $65 within a couple of years, what's the merit in getting it at $40 and then selling it at $42.50 just to maybe see it roar to $55 afterwards?  Yeah, it would be a quick 6.25% gain (taxes, fees and commissions excluded), which is nice, but it also means you invested time and energy in order to do a DD and just miss out on a much better return - and maybe not even beat the market despite being correct in the long-run.

What if you get a company and it just stagnates for 6-12 months? That's obviously fine with a long-term horizon, but it's not great if you want to use the money for trading, or if you ignore opportunities you deem to be better. Not to mention that a lot of buying power will eventually get tied up for the long-term if you just keep holding any company that doesn't immediately go up.

&#x200B;

So, general advice - ask yourself what you want to do, what your goal is and what you can do best. Then go down that route. Keep evaluating yourself and your performance along the way.",DRMRCX,0,/r/stocks/comments/ott6ex/day_trading_with_longterm_stocks/h6y4mvx/,0.039,0.828,0.134,0.9802

However, given that you selected a ""good"" stock, and that it continues to be one you'd consider buying new or holding, ... but you begin to consider if the goin' is too good, then I often sell a little and let the rest ride. In your example, you bought $500 it's now worth \~$700, I'd sell $500 (my initial position) and let the gains ride (assuming your DD hasn't changed the fundamental reason for owning the stock). That's a what?, \~40%-ish gain? I'd take that gain, ... but keep the gains in the stock that treated you well. You lock in some gains, but you don't miss out on lost opportunity by selling it all and then watching it rise (which is also fine, btw, 'cos you made 40% with which you were pleased).

&#x200B;

You hedge your bets by not making it an ""all or nothing"", you leave your gains in the game, but take your initial investment out of the game to make another play (which could be in the same stock if it takes a dip, could be in another stock that's on your radar that is poised for it's own gains, etc.)

Now, for things like PLTR, I may decide to sell at one point when there is a decent gain and reinvest the profit into the long term divident aristocrats. However, last month I missed the opportunity to sell PLTR at 10% simply because I say to myself that I hold it for the long term and now I am in the red again. Will see what I decide to do when it is green again.
