1,AAPL," My three  ‚Äúmissed out‚Äù stories. 
 
 * Own a Google Dilbert mug.  They sold them before IPO.  Bought the mug, not the stock
 * AMZN at around $100.  Guys at work were pushing AAPL at the start of the iPhone (also a good buy).  I said ‚Äúamazon can‚Äôt keep loosing billions a quarter.  This is market share and when the profits start this stock is going through the roof‚Äù.  So I wanted to use my 401k and talked about buying 10s of thousands (dollars). but my acct was only set up for mutual funds.  I went down to the woman who is in charge of this stuff for our company...she was nasty. Gave me a bunch of shit. I walked out saying ‚ÄúForget it. I‚Äôll just call the xx401kxx company‚Äù.  I never did.   We archive our chat client and years later I searched and found the chat versions of the conversation where I said I was going to buy at $110 or something 
 * TSLA:  have some fancy people in my work.  Company put chargers in.  The Tesla‚Äôs start appearing. A LOT.  Could see the chargers and Teslas from the windows where my team worked and we talked about them all the time.  We literally watched the growth of the company.  Never bought 

I did buy 3 bitcoin at $400 each and sold @ $11,000 (sold while sitting on the toilet in bathroom stall).  I get that it‚Äôs much higher now but I am ok with 2500% returns in 2 or 3 years

Missing out on big things in inevitable if you have sound judgement. If you had the mindset to go all in on Tesla back then planning on holding till now, then it means you also have a mindset that would've put you in much more stupid investments that lost you money.

25,GME," Personally I feel we are in the new dot com bubble. Cheap money has been around essentially since dot com bubble burst. And it has only gotten cheaper since the great recession, and trump policies. 

In my opinion, Tesla, Amazon, Cloudflair, most weed companies, etc are all way overvalued because of this cheap money. I am not saying these companies don't have great futures ahead of them, but for the most part it will take them decades and decades to actually have enough revenue to equal what they are valued at. 

Last I hear Tesla would take 1600 years with consistent growth to get to todays evaluation. 

So all in, next bubble is coming. When? Anyone's guess. My bet sometime this year or next year. Essentially when the bell tolls for the loans, and people start selling it will become a quick panic sell. I mean just look at GME, that but the entire market. But unlike GME being a 2-3 week period, I suspect it will take a 2-3 months.

So many times I see people regretting how they sold AAPL, TSLA, AMD, and others.

Even if you want to exit a position all together, doing it gradually over time might be better. It's basically dollar cost averaging. You will not be kicking yourself because you missed the perfect opportunity to sell, or that you sold at a low. You'll know that you stuck to your strategy, even if the outcome was not optimal.

50,EV," Even if Tesla cars weren't superior, people would still prefer them. They are to electric cars now what iPhones are to Smartphones. It doesn't have to be the best anymore for most people to still choose one over an OEM that dabbed in the same market and even made a technologically better product. Most people who could afford it would still much rather pay a premium for a Tesla over a Nissan or Chevy even if the latter had a superior range. This is also what makes the stock so interesting. 

We also know that the market is at the beginning of its runway and guaranteed to fly very high in the years to come. Tesla can be detached from fundamentals because it's selling one of the biggest promises that most people hold towards our future that will finally materialize, and it appears clear that Tesla will be at the forefront of it. EV make up for 2-3% of all cars sold at the moment. Now imagine a couple of years from now when most vehicles sold are electric, and Tesla is anywhere close to being the market leader. They're on track to rack up dozens times of what they're making now, and their competition are geared to approach that market as followers.

69,EVER," I would argue Musk isn‚Äôt a visionary. He‚Äôs a salesman. And a very effective one at that. But he over promises and under delivers at every turn. 

If he were to suddenly die, the Tesla stock would implode (IMO) because it seems to be propped up by people buying into viewing him as a visionary.

The hyperloop is a literal pipe dream that will NEVER work as he promised because he over promised on the laws of physics.

Space X and the reusable rocket has not cut the cost of getting payloads into orbit by 20x as he promised. It‚Äôs about a 10% savings.

He has not revolutionized battery technology. He‚Äôs merely helped move along incremental improvements.

Commercial air travel via rocket will NEVER be a reality. EVER (at least within our lifetimes) and almost certainly never. He would need to make rocket technology 1000x safer to even come close to the safety and reliability of conventional jet travel. (Currently rockets have a 1% failure rate. Would you travel to Europe via rocket if you had a 1/100 chance of dying, even if it saved you a days worth of travel?)

BB is a weird stock right now, I know some of you only want to see the positives but the truth is it'll take a long time to go up, will likely continue to fall in the short term (but you never know if another meme surge will happen), and long term growth is a little riskier on this play than some of the other stocks you could get into right now

181,BB," I think it really and finally is different now though. They legitimately sold off all of their phone patents in the last year or so. That alone signals they are done with smartphone hardware and finally leaving that business behind entirely. Software is much more profitable. Back in 2010-2011 people thought they could re-emerge in the phone space and re-invent how they sell phones and software. Now they have signaled all of that is in the past and they are looking forward to new software and tech opportunities.

Their emerging tech revenue is branded under ""Technology solutions"". Where  sales grew from $151 million in FY‚Äô17 to $204 million in FY‚Äô19, driven by higher sales of QNX to the automotive market and stronger sales of the fleet management solution. With expected sales to rise to about $296 million by FY‚Äô21. In 3 years they've double their revenue in new market sectors. I expect their enterprise tech to continue to grow at a relatively average pace, but their technology solutions revenue has huge growth potential.

EDIT: Handset and related services sales have declined from $687 million in FY‚Äô17 to just about $59 million in FY‚Äô19, as BlackBerry exited the handset space while seeing significant attrition of legacy handset users, who paid a monthly subscription fee.

This isn't just ""here we go again BB is trying to sound like they are innovating"". They actually are this time.

If they‚Äôre failing an expensive launch on purpose, you have to answer why. To make sure failsafes worked? Probably cheaper ways to do that. To draw in investors? Very irresponsible and negligent if true. 

This is attempting to minimize the greatest risk that they‚Äôre facing. One failed launch w/o passengers tanked the price. What happens if this occurs again? Or maybe not on this upcoming one, but the next one? Or one after that, killing a very famous person that will draw global headlines?

They plan to reduce their oil production by 1-2% every year going forward. To make up for this, their diversification includes not only building 500,000 additional electric charging station by 2025, but also the expansion of biofuels and other renewables like hydrogen and a doubling-down of their natural gas and electric energy production businesses. Maybe I‚Äôm just not paying attention, but I‚Äôve not seen any other oil company pushing this hard to get away from making oil. 

The obvious question here is do these initiatives simply make up for their declining oil business, or will they also allow the company to thrive? Well, in addition to all of the above, Shell is also planning to pay down its debts and increase its dividend by 4% every year. That would seem to indicate that Shell sees these moves as making its business increasingly profitable and not just a way to stay alive. 

One of my investing goals is to increase my exposure to companies that are poised to take advantage of increasing demand in electricity production, electrical infrastructure, and end user delivery of electricity to the EV market.

> They have never made money on their car business and take on more debt and sell a ridiculous amount of shares and the stock is rewarded.

I think GAAP EPS would **strongly** disagree with you there. Tesla wouldn't have a PE ratio if they weren't profitable. Also have you looked at analyst estimates for 2021 earnings? Tesla is expected to be a lot more profitable this year (and next) by many analysts.

> In 2020 tsla sold 499,000 cars the most ever and lost money...the profit is made from selling ev credits to other manufacturers, so that the other manufacturers want to produce evs... so no tsla actually has never been profitable 

Tesla earns EV credits for each car they sale, so of course it should be counted as part of the profit of selling a vehicle. Tesla isn't getting those EV credits for simply being a car company. Saying they shouldn't be counted as part of the profit is just cherry picking to get the result you want, an argument that Tesla isn't profitable despite the their 6 or so profitable quarters in a row.

Also check the math in Tesla's earnings, they **are** in fact profitable without the EV credits. They're a lot less profitable yes, but they're still profitable.

> Since the company's existence all they have done is burn cash. 

Guess what? Research and Development takes **a lot** of money, especially when you're jumping into a new industry with a lot of upfront costs as a barrier to entry. Tesla had to spend that money to make money in the future. All that R&D is paying dividends today. If Tesla hasn't burned a bunch of cash for the last decade they would never be in as strong of a position in the market as they are today.

> On tsla balance sheet of 19 billion or so cash...and 13 billion debt...this cash is absolutely not from the car business....this is from the stock market...they sold nearly 20 billion worth of shares out of thin air.... 

Again, cash is cash, no matter how they got it. 

Tesla would be foolish **not** to take advantage of their stock price to raise cash to continue funding their expansion and R&D. I mean look at Gamestop, they could have loaded their balance sheet with a TON of cash back when their shares were over $400, but they didn't, and now the opportunity is gone. If they need to raise more money in the future it will be MUCH more expensive for them.

Buy UAMY and Sell the March 2.5 Calls with a break even around 1.25

Price at expiration >2.50 roughly $130 per 100 shares and contract

No price movement - about $40 (.40 per contract) and sell new contracts

Price goes down - continue to sell new contracts and continue to reduce cost basis.

&#x200B;

I am seeing about $130 per 100 shares potential upside with the ability to manage the risk to the down side.

They hit their revenue target for 2020 and projected that through Q1 but gave low guidance for 2021 overall. A drop from 45% to 30% in 2021 is absolutely awful guidance for a company trading on growth rate. 

You wanted to see PLTR sustaining 40% growth for years to come.

Not to mention at 55x sales this stock was arguably very overvalued for the 45% growth rate. 30% forward guidance kills this stock at the current price.

For one, they are already at maximum capacity AND have a backlog of orders from Apple, AMD, etc. I would imagine this to be the case for automobile semiconductor manufacturing as well. While they are growing and expanding, they don't anticipate their new infrastructure to mass produce until late next year.

Furthermore, TSMC's main technological advantage is to produce sub-10 nm semiconductors, which is how they stole a ton of the market from Intel and other manufacturers.

So TSMC isn't going to sacrifice manufacturing things like graphics processors, which have 300x profit, for an automobile component.

Because of the two points above, any surplus demand can simply go to other foundries like ON Semiconductor. They aren't faced with sub-10 nm semiconductor demands like smartphones require so they are positioned to manufacture automobile semiconductors.

Finally, the P/E and forward P/E for TSMC is almost equal. That tells you that analysts don't expect the earnings to significantly increase beyond last quarter, since TSMC is already at max capacity. ON Semiconductor, on the other hand, has a significantly lower and thus much more favorable forward P/E.

They didn't have a factory that could handle this at all, and whatever they have built in the past 6 months is almost certainly much smaller than what Moderna has built and is operating already.

Based on my research there are 2 factors why the sell off post earnings was higher than expected last week.

1. There were supply constraints that inhibited more sales by corsair. A lot of semiconductor products with bad supply chain management which meant there were supply bottlenecks with product delivery.

2. Back to normalcy post-pandemic may have a bearish sentiment on the overall demand of gaming products in the future and we all know that the market likes to price things in years in advance. I suppose this is a decent argument though because they sell high quality products that are built to last so how will they attract a new wave of customers?

601,DD, Im really glad someone is cutting through all the cannabis hype to deliver a more reasonable approach.

602,AMD," If you are okay with big risks, one stock I think might be worth considering is Mega Uranium ($MGA). It is a small Canadian uranium mining company working in Australia. It has a market cap of only 80 million. I own 60k shares at 0.13$. My reason for being so bullish on it is I believe nuclear power will become much more common in the coming years. I think thorium reactors will become common 10-20 years in the future, but until then uranium is what we have. This being a penny stock it has potential for big growth.

Another risky stock is Drone Delivery Canada ($FLT). They develop drones for deliveries. They have yet to generate a profit, but they are slowly making more and more money (still burning cash though). They just received a contract with the Canadian government to deliver vaccine doses to remote communities. They are on track to turn a profit in the next year or two I believe. I own 5k shares at 1.73$

AMD is another stock I'm bullish on, and the largest chunk of my portfolio with 150 shares at around 91.5$. I think this one has great potential for growth (although much less than the first two) and less risk. They make a great product and most of the market is controlled by Intel which make a lower quality product. The chip shortage make what they make in demand, Biden just announced the problem of the chip shortage needs to be addressed and many products are starting to use AMD chips (Samsung smartphones, Asus laptops).

If anyone has another opinion on these I'd love to hear them. I'm starting to think I'm looking at these picks through rose colored glasses.",reeferqueefer,7,/r/stocks/comments/llbq4e/best_growth_stocksfunds_to_invest_in_for_3_years/gnokc84/,0.061,0.806,0.133,0.9791
603,GM," I'm not an expert but it seems logical to invest in Lithium mining right now. The electric vehicle boom is going to happen, no amount of fossil fuel lobbying will stop it anymore. Now, we could app argue for days over whether Tesla, GM, Volkswagen, or anyone else will produce the best one but right now they all have one thing in common, inclusion of lithium as a primary component in their batteries due to the need to recharge hundreds of times. While there is a lithium industry in place with companies like $PLL there is going to be an explosion in demand for this material as soon as mass manufacturing begins. The way I look at it, there's no point in dumping serious money into a manufacturer unless you know a lot about the industry because there's a serious number of variables in play, so investing in companies cresting their precursor materials makes more sense as there are certain materials that you cannot produce these vehicles without.",SomeJustOkayGuy,3,/r/stocks/comments/llbq4e/best_growth_stocksfunds_to_invest_in_for_3_years/gnojhux/,0.111,0.801,0.088,-0.0772

617,CEO," If anyone is interested in a genuine long-term weed play on a company with good fundamentals, look up High Tide Inc.

Heres a quick DD from the top of my head:

Pros: Canada's largest cannabis retailer based on revenue, they are making profits, have applied for NASDAQ,  have 70 retail stores in Canada and looking to expand to 100+ stores and the US market, owns multiple websites such as grasscity.com,  have celebrity endorsements from famous stoners such as Snoop Dogg and Cheech and Chong, their CEO personally owns 20% of the company in shares,  Aphria and Aurora have a combined $14.5 million invested in them, and the stock is only trading at $0.67 USD!!

Cons: Same cons as any weed stocks. However, High Tide is a Canada retail company and for the time being, there are no signs of Canada trying to mess with their marijuana laws. Furthermore, a good chunk of High Tide's revenue is already from the US and if weed does gets legalized federally in the US, they have a strong foothold already and most likely will expand their stores into the US market, which will generate more revenue.

I don't think they do.

Anything you can do on Iridium you can do on Starlink at better data rates and latency.

Iridium has some special customers who probably won't touch Starlink, but they're just a core. Iridium needs volume to profit.

So unless Iridium has some magic upgrade planned or intends to heavily discount prices, I don't see how they grow or keep market share.

E-commerce is much more mainstream in China, Jd for example is the  #1 provider for grocery, retail goods, and pharmaceuticals in China, you can think of them of a Walmart, Amazon, CVS hybrid but of course exclusively online. Alibaba should need no introduction with their Taobao, and Tmall platforms. Pinduoduo is interesting in that it‚Äôs value oriented and very popular among the rural lower class as well as the urban population in China, they would also benefit heavily from an economic downturn due to their social media like approach to group buying that can see participants enjoy discounts of up to 90%.

Although, if you're looking to continue on the ETF trend. SPYD is a nice,low cost addition. Otherwise SUBZ,  is a new etf from roundhill investments that focuses on streaming companies. Has large holdings in the likes of Netflix, Spotify, Roku and Disney. SUBZ is more of a high risk high reward. If the market stays hot, this one could double in a year. If we have a downturn this one could crash hard.

>They are also best positioned to meet the shortage because they have the most infrastructure in place.

For one, they are already at maximum capacity AND have a backlog of orders from Apple, AMD, etc. I would imagine this to be the case for automobile semiconductor manufacturing as well. While they are growing and expanding, they don't anticipate their new infrastructure to mass produce until late next year.

Furthermore, TSMC's main technological advantage is to produce sub-10 nm semiconductors, which is how they stole a ton of the market from Intel and other manufacturers. Even in the WSJ article it says ""But the harsh reality is that chips for cars have to compete for manufacturing space with other products that generate a much higher return. Nvidia, a major TSMC customer, sells some of its latest gaming processors for several hundred dollars apiece, whereas many of the microcontrollers used in the world‚Äôs automobiles can fetch a dollar or less."" So TSMC isn't going to sacrifice manufacturing things like graphics processors, which have 300x profit, for an automobile component.

Because of the two points above, any surplus demand can simply go to other foundries like ON Semiconductor. They aren't faced with sub-10 nm semiconductor demands like smartphones require so they are positioned to manufacture automobile semiconductors.

Finally, the P/E and forward P/E for TSMC is almost equal. That tells you that analysts don't expect the revenue to significantly increase beyond last quarter, since TSMC is already at max capacity. ON Semiconductor, on the other hand, has a significantly lower and thus much more favorable forward P/E.
