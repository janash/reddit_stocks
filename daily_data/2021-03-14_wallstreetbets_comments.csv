27,GME," Isn't that the greatest part of all this.  This stock was under $4 early August 2020.  6 months later it rose to over 120 times that value.  Currently it's over 66 times early August value.  Sure, it went down to under 10 times that value but here we are today.

Something is happening.  My brain is too smooth to know what the future holds but we all have confidence to hodl.  I have 100 shares and if I cashed out today I'd make over 10k profit.  I'm not scared though.  It's fucked up how much I believe (in what I don't know) but I've never really felt this way --- it's positive and has made this winter so much better.  You know what I thought when GME rebounded from the $170 dip this past week?  Maybe I should buy more.  So I did buy more at $248.

If it goes to zero on Monday then lesson learned and I'll walk away hoping I made a difference.  The difference being is millions of people knowing that the stock market is 100% against them.  On the other end, maybe it'll skyrocket and be life changing.

128,ALL," I went to see the gorillas in the 90s. Groups of 6 were led in by 30+ armed soldiers because rival armies were fighting in those mountains. 2 people were taken in to sit for a few minutes with the gorillas at a time - to minisise us infecting them with germs.

As expected, it was expensive to do this. We can't all go see them, even if we had the money - adoption is the next best thing.The gorillas are tracked & their area patroled 24/7. They need it. Preserving them is also preserving their habitat - all this costs more than 300 donations.

This is a sub of almost 10 million subscribers. And I followed this sub (from my main account) since 2014 and I still didn't subscribe (nor did many of my friends who also followed this sub for years).

So the actual number might be far far more. Even multiples (simply cause it's embarrassing to sub this subreddit for many).

&#x200B;

There's a huge population here. One of my friend did a yolo play on tesla last year with 14 million dollars (never posted on WSB).

Trust me, lots of unfathomable money gets inputted from posts here. You just don't see it (cause many don't post publicly).

I lost $40k alone in the month. Still net positive. And I never posted my positions here :)

And then go to TeamBlind. There are developers making $300\~600k a year throwing money to many of the WSB bets. People keep talking about 'whales' and all. Truth is, this entire subreddit if dedicated is 1 huge whale. The only issue is everyone does separate plays.

Theoretically, if everyone here in this sub bought in average 4 shares of GME, GME would have skyrocketed long time ago. But GME still didn't. Still an amazing subreddit if you think about it.

Furthermore, more funding could go to philanthropic efforts and education (really the number 1 thing we need). GME could then just proliferate into so many places that everyone benefits. We really need a company to lead an effort like this. I can think of no better candidate. +And some of us get tendies to do the things we've always dreamed of... but...

424,RH," It wasn’t option chain. Lol I was on robinhood when I noticed this. I had candle chart selected and usually don’t. I bet everyone who has an option contract in robinhood would see the same thing (plz don’t say shit using rh.. I didn’t have choice.. I def hate rh more than anyone). 
But for some reason clicked on an option I’m holding. If you change chart to weekly chart, hold down the longest candle, the low for the contract says $.01 so everyone’s options went to $.01 Wednesday.. at least on RH... if I pull the same chart on webull, the bottom of the candle on 3/10 doesn’t drop below $100. I bitched robinhood out bc if my account if anywhere near $25k, my other calls all of a sudden go to .01 value. Lol I literally have screen shots showing the option before mine and after mine show $2.00 and $1.80 and then mine in the middle at $.01 and not a single option has any volume that day. Not that I would trade anything I’m holding... but what if I wanted to say trade or not worry about trading restrictions... or if I didn’t know how shitty RH platform was... that might have influenced me to sell my position if I thought it was accurate. 

It’s not the first time I’ve noticed stuff on robinhood that I don’t think they intended people to see. For example the massive sell orders for like $5, $10, $15, and so on when a stock trades for like $110. I posted something a while back somewhere and now you can’t see those type of orders on the level 2 data. but then I noticed on webull they are still there... the line highlights but no numbers actually show up. 

If you’re looking at option chain.. I did notice Thursday night tho... there were a lot of call options with 0 open interest but had volume... and then massive amounts of put options. Lol I almost fell for it. Don’t fall for it.

I will never get sick of these adoption posts. Ever single one releases a tiny drop of the stress I have been carrying my whole life about the fate of our planet, forests, oceans and animals.... 💚🌎🦍. 

Anyone who slanders WSB can suck a knob! THIS is what good people do when they come into excess $$$$. The GameStop play has allowed everyday people to shift a little bit of the massive wealth that has been HOARDED by Billionaires. Billionaires have accumulated $$$$ NOT by adding value to the world but by sequestering $$$ from people, from govt, from the exploitation of the earth, and taking more for themselves than they deserve. The wealth of billionaires comes at the expense of human health and environmental health. As they get richer as the planet gets sicker..... BUT you know what happens when people who have a shred of conscious and good hearts get a scoop of that money? -they put some of it back to HELPING the land- adopting apes cause it’s cool! 🦍🦍🦍

The wealthy elite would delight in seeing that last remnants of health and diversity on earth be converted into a few final digits in their bloated bank accounts. 💔

The way I see it: by foiling them a bit with GME, and ‘adopting’ these animals, WSB is Reallocating some of the stolen wealth/health of he world BACK into forests, BACK into land, diversity, and healthier balanced ecosystems. Back to the places that were ravaged to generate $$$ for those at the top in the first place... there are those that would covert the whole world, forest, oceans, and humanity into $$$ yet here we are converting $$$ back into planetary health.

I think it is really commendable that people are doing this even though the meme level is fucking astronomical.

Not only would this be great ammo against the media disinformation about the sub and the degenerates in it but it might also encourage others to donate some of their tendies to those in need if they want to. There could even be annual charity drive goals if it became something popular.

I don't mind putting it together if people want to DM proof of donations we can keep track of where WSB money has helped and how much.

Usually the meat is free, because it would otherwise have gone to waste.

616,GME," So can we pretend for a second that I am a slightly more rich and much more morally absent ape then I am? I want to make sure I understand and explaining the inverse seems like a way to do that. 

Say I had 100 shares of GME. Closing price was $264.59. I think to myself ""there is no way we are getting to $450 by EOW and stealing bananas from other apes sounds like fun."" I sell a call with strike price of $450 expiring 4/19 and rake in my banana premiums. If we don't hit $450 by then I lose nothing, gain premium and buy some more GME with my money. If we do go to $450 or beyond someone exercises their option and takes my shares, but I lose all profit beyond the $450 because I promised and basically deserve what I got. 

On the put side pretend I have enough bananas to buy 100 shares at $100, but for some reason my monkey brain says screw buying at open I don't want more shares even though I know the stock is going to go up. So I sell a put telling people I promise to buy 100 stocks at $100 by 4/19. If the stock stays above $100 I get to keep my bananas and add premium. If the stock goes down someone exercises their option and I have to buy stocks worth $50 for $100. 

Do I basically have the idea for covered calls and puts? I know naked is different, but ape brain is still wrapping head around covered for now....

Similar to a gamma squeeze where delta will pull the price up as MM stay delta neutral on an increasing stock, is there an inverse effect from puts?

It clearly isn’t going to drop to any level close enough to exercising and whoever is placing them, if it was to make money, probably would have sold them during the huge drop Wednesday?

You need to put your BTO  ITM so you have the highest delta possible (converging very close to one) but if the price moves to quickly upward then your STO is eating your gains via extrinsic value.

if you're going to wait it out until friday congrats you have balls but theta doesn't sleep it's still eating so your gains are going to diminish. Best thing I've seen is the wait for the ITM pop on BTO, then close both positions.

worse case price drops and you're BTO goes to nothing and you just straight lose money with no hope of recovery.

I did a calendar call spread where i STO'd a 3/12 for C350 while I held a C320 3/19.

681,GME," IV is based on options open interest.  People buy deep OTM calls and deep OTM puts then that equates IV.  The only way IV drops is if everyone closes their poaitionsnand start buying positions much closer to strike.  

This is why IV is *implied* and not natural.  It's implied by what options people are buying and where.  As long as you have people betting that GME will drop to $40 and people betting it'll moon to $800 IV will remain ridiculous.

Edit to add that this is why IV is game able if you have enough money.  Buy enough deep, deep OTM options and you will spike IV.  IV spike triggers algo.  Algo triggers movement.

Have you ever tried doing a straddle or wedge? It wouldn’t work in a normal environment where stocks hardly move 10% in a year, but I read that you use a strategy that would get shit on by regular investors and thought you might be intrigued. It provides upside and hedged risk management at the same time but will lose money if the stock doesn’t move(strategy tends to work better the longer you wait but allows you to hedge a position while maintaining your original long). My example would be PG 125p/130C 4/23exp for a total of $2.90. A 5% swing would put it itm including 100% of cost, 120 was the most recent strong support and 143 seems to be long resistance. Earnings is on 4/23, quadruple witching is this Friday and stimulus is coming out. I feel like a 5% swing in either way is not out of the ordinary especially given 1 month to expiration and upcoming catalysts.",TreeHugChamp,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5094m/celebrating_my_1_year_anniversary_of_my/gqx9eoi/,0.059,0.8,0.141,0.9474

And the single way everyone wants to aim for to win is by buying the bottom and selling the top.

726,ATH," > Did anyone notice on Friday that the market didn't really care that rates zoomed from 1.5 to

I’ve got an explanation for that !

I’ve been reading up on short term second derivative flow vs macro economic flow and how to tell when it is important 

The first thing you need to do is set up a bollinger band with a 20 day simple moving average and +/- 1 standard deviation channel. Movement in the 1 as channel is expected and noice. Breaking and closing above or below the 1sd is not noise and indicative of further movement in that direction 

If you look back to the weakness a few weeks ago you’ll notice we sold past but never closed below the 1sd channel. Technically you need 2 days closing below in order to confirm trend

So, there are 2 second order derivatives that are very important: vanna and charm. These provide support in what is know as a “bullish window” which exists every month before monthly
VIX expired AND ALSO before monthly OPEX

After those 2 expirations, vanna and charm have minimal effect on the market and a bearish window appears. Macro events heavily influence market movement during this window 

That said, this week is fed week. The market ignored the rise last week because:

1) vanna / charm are working overtime 

2) who knows what the fed will say/do and HOPIUM is kinda huge right now

The biggest tell next week is the following 

1) monthly vix expires 3/17, the day of FOMC

2) if we can not breach new ATHs AND CLOSE THERE by 3/17, look out below 

3) if we DO breach ATH and close at the highs by 3/17, the bearish window will be very short lived and that gives us the pass to 4200-4300 range

So, sit back and enjoy! It’s going to be a wild ride",Rick_Perrys_Asshole,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4odqq/spy_400_technical_analysis_for_the_week_ahead_for/gqwge1d/,0.021,0.9,0.078,0.9608

729,DD," I've been invested in this company from about 60 cents. I've been doing DD on them for about 2 years. I recently wrote a long detailed post on the Agoracom forum on the bull case for them.

Here were my 25 key points to hold the stonk to infinity:

Some key fundamental points:

PYR has $0 debt

PYR has 159.15 mil shares outstanding fully diluted of which 76.95mil are owned by Peter and strategic entities. Most sites put the float at 51 mil shares of which most of it is owned by retail. Interactive Brokers shows virtually no institutional holdings yet. If institutions begin to list this in ETFs when the NASDAQ uplist happens, if they are passive etfs that buy to maintain weight, they will buy at any price to maintain that weight as money comes into the fund.

It is almost impossible to make a target for the stock price based on torch sales because there are just to many variables to consider. Selling price, margin, P/E multiple to apply, repeat sales over time, service contracts that go with the sale. But no matter how you crunch your own numbers, JUST looking at the conservative estimate for torch sales and no other business lines. It already justifies a higher SP than we are at currently in my own opinion. I believe margins are healthy on torches. We don't know exactly what they are and Peter SHOULD keep those secret as much as he can for shareholders benefit.

DROSRITE

HPQ Nano royalties with option to own 50% of the subsidiary

US Military service contracts

Purevap technology

Additive Manufacturing, 3D powders

They are flush with cash currently, reducing risk (not eliminating) of a raise and dilution

The CEO still owns roughly 50% of the company. (This was one of my initial reasons for investing in the company 2 years ago. I like companies with large CEO ownership. Just a personal preference)

The Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB) is active and PYR can buyback its own shares and cancel them, (like they did before, then reissue at a higher price, netting cash in hand) adding value to shareholders via float concentration.

$40 mil backlog of signed contracts.

Some key technical points:

It's the same 5 minute chart pattern everyday since the $4 breakout. Strong buying at open, MACD crosses bearish but the stock holds the line, goes sideways, and breaks back out near end of day or the next day. This feels like accumulation to me but I do not have access to net house metrics anymore to research this theory.

RSI's are overbought, but the underlying fundamentals, and social analysis justify that in my opinion.

We were above the Upper Bollinger Band on the daily but we maintain the 20ma on all timeframes anytime there is a pullback. Now that it has consolidated, its setup nicely for new all time high.

Short interest, from what I have access to, has not changed much since the start of the new year and is a small percentage of the shares outstanding on TSX. I don't expect a short squeeze is possible here.

Average volume has been increasing by about 70-100% since Feb 1st. Most days volumes are above the avg 10d volume before noon. This is another reason I put less weight to RSI being overbought. RSI SHOULD be overbought if the stock is strong. It's called RELATIVE strength indicator for that reason.

There are no option contracts on the stock yet. If options become available it can change the dynamic of how the stock price plays out. It also allows Robinhood traders to leverage their smaller positions and invest with smaller capital in the company. Options also make the stock more attractive to longs who want to write covered calls (like me) at their target price and collect premiums on their holdings while they wait for their target to hit.

Some key social points:

10-20 videos released talking about PYR in the last 2 weels

300,000+ cumulative views on those so far. More will see them over the next few weeks as well.

Twitter mentions have risen significantly.

Searches for the term 'pyrogenesis stock' are now at their highest levels in 12 months. (Source: Google trends)

Some of the larger Youtube personalities could start to cover the stock. The audience reach can grow significantly yet still.

There are no institutional analysts covering the stock yet. This can grow audience awareness significantly still.

There are a lot of US brokers that do not allow customers to buy OTC stocks. When PYRNF uplists to PYR on the NASDAQ the flood gates open to buyers but the float stays the same and the Level 2 books remain thin. I personally believe that when the uplist happens there will be literally MILLIONS more people who can buy the stock and have no shares to sell. This massively impacts the supply and demand metrics.

Point number 7 cannot be overstated in my opinion as one of the largest social impacts on the stock.

In the past when I have sold stock in companies too early, my biggest mistake was not putting enough weight the social impact can have on a stocks price. I now add 50-100% to my target that is allocated to the additional effect the social media impact can have in the new market.

If my fundamental fair value analysis target is $1 on a stock for example, I add 0.50 - $1.00 more for the social impact on top of that to my target.

CONCLUSION

I have increased my personal target for the stock significantly over the last week after doing a deeper analysis from 3 points of view.

These guys have 4 main revenue streams. My two favorites are in iron ore pelletization, and additive manufacturing (3d printing).

The iron ore thing is looking very good. There's some compelling evidence that the contracts we know they're pursuing with clients A, B, and C, are the biggest players in iron. Replacing their diesel burners with plasma torches would be a multi billion dollar endeavor. The torches reduce GHG and these guys have tight emissions standards to meet.

The Additive Manufacturing is the part that's got ARK investing. Using plasma these guys can turn wire feed into powders used in 3d printing. Google 'Plasma Atomization'. Apparently the quality of their powders is awesome, and they make it cheaper than others can do it.

And there's still the Waste Treatment and Dross recovery revenue streams...

Here's another potential earner for Pyrogenesis. [HPQ Silicon](https://hpqsilicon.com/). They use Pyrogenesis tech to turn quartz into nano silicon. They're thinking they make silicon small and stable enough to be used in EV battery anodes. It's earlier days there, but if silicon could supplant graphite in the EV supply chain, specifically HPQ's silicon, that could be massive. So far all their tests are coming back super positive. Pyro owns a large stake in HPQ and gets royalties on future profits. Pyro also holds an option to convert the royalties into a 50% ownership. So if HPQ works out as well as they think it will, that alone could be huge.

The Additive Manufacturing is the part that's got ARK investing. Using plasma these guys can turn wire feed into powders used in 3d printing. Google 'Plasma Atomization'. Apparently the quality of their powders is awesome, and they make it cheaper than others can do it.

And there's still the Waste Treatment and Dross recovery revenue streams...

&#x200B;

Here's another potential earner for Pyrogenesis. [HPQ Silicon](https://hpqsilicon.com/). They use Pyrogenesis tech to turn quartz into nano silicon. They're thinking they make silicon small and stable enough to be used in EV battery anodes. It's earlier days there, but if silicon could supplant graphite in the EV supply chain, specifically HPQ's silicon, that could be massive. So far all their tests are coming back super positive. Pyro owns a large stake in HPQ and gets royalties on future profits. Pyro also holds an option to convert the royalties into a 50% ownership. So if HPQ works out as well as they think it will, that alone could be huge.

The CEO has emphasized explicitly in several NR's that the iron ore pelletization torches will be priced around 3MM.

Each torch prevents about $1MM/year in carbon emissions, when carbon emissions are valued at $50/ ton.

A single processing plant requires about 50 torches. At least one of the clients in negotiation with PYR have over ten plants.

We have some pretty radical recipes and ideas about how to build a really awesome community (and a very profitable business) in the space, just gotta raise some capital for physical space.

975,GME," So just ballparking numbers, 50-100m US traders active recently, some Canadians who are not even sorry, Mexico, South America, our Euro bros, our Asian allies, Oceania, Africa, this really is around the world. The potential population of GME buyers is above 140m. So to make this long story a short-squeeze, 50% of them have to hold an average of about 1 share? Well don't think of it that way, factor by 10, and you get this much more reasonable question:

Across all of those populations, could there be a sub-population of about 5-7m traders with an average of 10 shares each that refuse to sell until above 1k? (-< or insert personal price target here). That's 3-5% of the potential buyers, just about the percentage we get from OP's numbers estimated from RobbingUsHood data.

But we can also factor by 10 once more: Could there be a further sub-population of about 500,000 retards with an average of 100 shares each? Because there is more of this sub-population being jacked to the tits and buying options than ever before, I think the answer to my question is (insert aliens_guy gif) .... yes",positive_root,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m520iq/regarding_retail_has_no_power_numbers_data_a/gqxuxb6/,0.021,0.899,0.081,0.8677

1) it is truly a massive gift to all of humanity. Investing in the future of a world that still has biodiversity. For less than the price of a single GME share. ( I have allocated 1 GME share to the cause and made a small $100 donation) 

2) it is funny. I almost peed my sweatpants when I first saw all of the posts start flooding the sub

3) it is effective. From a self interested POV, this will translate to more news coverage, leading to more GME interest, more investment and a higher stock value for us HODLers.

999,NIO," I don't like NIO because battery-swapping is ultimately a dead-end.

There are several reasons and they interweave with each other but here is some brief info...

1. Building a swappable battery, means you are building an inferior car. That means additional cost and weight in how the car is built. Additional weight means less range (and more wear on the car, such as shorter tire-life).
2. As EV range is increasing, the choice to buy a better car with a non-swappable battery versus an inferior one with a swappable battery becomes clearer. Consumers will choose cars that are built better.
3. Swap stations are relatively complex, that will need regular service, and likely need an attendant in addition to issues with where they are located. Charging stalls on the other hand, can be placed anyplace where you have sufficient electrical capacity. They can be put curb-side where people park their cars. There is no real need for dedicated land devoted to charging.
4. Newer EV batteries are faster to charge, making the time to charge versus swap a non-significant issue.

Think about it. For a given price point you can have a car that performs better, weighs less, and has more range versus getting a car with a swappable battery. If the concern is lack of places to charge, then the car with the swappable battery will still need to deal with swapping batteries more often then you charge. If the concern is that on a longer-range trip you don't want to waste time charging, well you still are dealing with less range to begin with, with a swappable battery.

Bottom line, both from a practical standpoint and a price standpoint, battery swapping is a dead-end. It might be necessary as a stop-gap, so possible room for Nio's solution for the time being, but just don't see it being a thing in a few years.

I am considering Puts for Jan 2022. My one concern is that I have no way to time when investors realize NIO's current approach is a dead-end. I would not think someone like Hindenburg will come in and trash them, since they are a legit company with a legit product. Rather, my issue is, the product is not going to be the success investors hope it will be.",aka0007,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4lj4s/nio_bullcase_investment_thesis_plus_crazy_ogstyle/gqvfirk/,0.053,0.845,0.102,0.9741

1001,DD," I don’t want to pick on you but why worry about ‘virtue signalling’ with something genuine like a personal donation to charity? Fuck what everyone else thinks, support what you want!!!!

Also great DD, usually I quote the whole thing, but this is some gourmet shit!!!",VeRyOkAy69420,15,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4lj4s/nio_bullcase_investment_thesis_plus_crazy_ogstyle/gqv34vv/,0.202,0.523,0.276,0.6083
1002,IMO," NYC can put many curb side charging stations that you pay to park your car overnight at while it charges.

Garages (not your private one) in plenty of cities have charging stalls and can expand that as well.

The link below is just a start (in NYC).

As to flash charging that is ridiculous. Lucid is claiming they can charge 20 miles per minute. The Model 3 with a 250 kW charger can charge 15 miles per minute (with the upcoming 4680 cells the max charge rate will be significantly higher due to the lower electrical resistance). Now we don't need to talk about charging to 100% rather if I have a price competitive car that at about 85% of range has the same range as Nio's offering, then all I need to know is how long it takes to charge to 85% to see how inconvenient this is. Assuming we can get 25 miles of charge per minute, then a Nio swappable batter that gives you 200 miles of range, would be equivalent to charging about 150 miles of range (you are not swapping your battery at 0 miles of range left, more likely something between 25-75 miles), which would be 6 minutes.

But really the whole issue is moot, as cities will provide slow curb-side charges that you can park by over night (for a fee).

Like, I said, what Nio is doing might be useful now as a stop-gap, but long-term, IMO, it is a dead-end.",aka0007,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4lj4s/nio_bullcase_investment_thesis_plus_crazy_ogstyle/gqvloq9/,0.038,0.928,0.034,-0.0258

1004,GOEV," The thing with the lease structure is at the end of the day is just a payment structure. Total cost of owning the vehicle is more important as that will ultimately determine in a competitive environment how it can be priced.

I also have a sizable investment in Quantumscape (have a larger position in Telsa, and also have a few puts on RIDE/Lordstown Motors... considering puts on GOEV/Canoo, if I free up some cash... Nio is further down my list). QS, assuming the technology pans out (and seems that it might just work out), still has major challenges getting to mass production. If they can get that, definitely see QS increasing in value 10X+ over the next decade.

Glad you understand to be skeptical about solid-state claims. Agree if Nio does come out with a vehicle with it at a price that it is competitive, then the stock will go vertical.",aka0007,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4lj4s/nio_bullcase_investment_thesis_plus_crazy_ogstyle/gqwkjpt/,0.015,0.852,0.134,0.9371
