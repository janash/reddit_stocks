1,RH," Trying to transfer away from RH is an adventure. I initiated an account transfer from Fidelity. A few days later, RH locked my account, which I expected and was fine. Then a few days after that I got a message that it was unlocked and I was free to use it again. This makes me think they have contrived some reason to halt my transfer so I reached out to them and they won't talk to me unless I send them back a bunch of identity confirming personal info in an unencrypted email reply. (bday, last 4 SSN, etc.) I've asked for an alternative way to supply the info and now they are ignoring me so I have no way of knowing if my transfer is even still queued to process.

7,RH," Account Deficit question:

Earlier this week I did an instant transfer to RH. I understand RH takes a few days to take the money out of your bank account so you have to ""leave it"" so it's available. Well, Wednesday life got in the way, I had to take my pupper to the doggie ER and spent an arm and a leg. She's ok, but I spent $1000 I didn't have. I guess RH had not received their money yet when I paid for the doggie ER, because now my RH account is ""Deficit."" I checked under my account history next to Monday's deposit it says ""returning."" However, the ""returned"" money is not in my bank account. I guess that takes a few days, which is fair. God, What a mess. 

Anyway, here's my question: according to RH, if I want to resolve this I either need to:

A) Deposit what bounced and wait for it to clear. 

B) ""Close Positions""

The meaning of option A is obvious, but I can't do it until Feb 15th(payday). However, I'm confused about what RH means by ""close positions"" for option B? Are they saying I can ""sell"" my shares/crypto and ""give"" it to RH  and we'll be square?

11,RMBS," $IVR, hit hard by covid and recovering, high yield, profit and dividend increasing. Besides, it's heavily short, for those like squeeze, there's lot of juice in it. 

It has issued new shares recentlly but will benefit in long term by raising capital to increase profit, this how mREIT grow and this also provide the best time to buy this mREIT at the dip with great discount price. Buying dip is the best way to win big in REIT because you enjoy the yield and also the appreciation. 

$IVR is a great deal because profit is increasing and the dividend has raised 60% from $0.05 to $0.08 on Dec 2020 (follow the cash never go wrong). It is even safer now as 98% investment is in Agency RMBS. Selling on discount with huge potential. All this is my opinion, do your study.

224,RH," I am in a similar situation. According to Fidelity, cash in your transferred accounts should be swept over to them as various holds are released.

225,RH," I can't even find where to make the request.. where did you do it? I transferred everything to Webull and $1000 got 'stuck' behind and now RH won't let me withdraw it to my bank or anything. But when I go into the contact page it just says they're experiencing a lot of volume and here's the FAQ, good luck.

229,TDA," I have been trying to with my cash for the past two weeks. I figured I would give them the T+2, which should end some time today.

I keep getting the ""Account withdrawal disabled"" message and that the withdrawal failed. Of course Support is too bogged down with everything happening to get a quick answer.

Thinking to just activate my transfer from TDA and let them handle it, if that works.",Deelbeson,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/ld4us9/daily_discussion_thread_february_5th_2021/gm4fqgb/,0.047,0.883,0.07,-0.1027
230,AAPL," I transferred a bunch of shares that I had over to Ally. I think I started the transfer last Saturday. A day or two after I initiated the transfer, ally sent me an email saying the transfer couldnâ€™t be processed automatically and that it would have to be done manually but no further action was needed from me. I got that email weds. This am the stocks were removed from my robinhood account but have not shown up in ally yet. I did not have to transfer everything. When I filled out the info on Ally it asked me which tickers and how many shares. One of the stocks I transferred was AAPL, robinhood would not let me buy any stocks or options for AAPL

233,RH," >Then a few days after that I got a message that it was unlocked and I was free to use it again. This makes me think they have contrived some reason to halt my transfer so I reached out to them and they won't talk to me unless I send them back a bunch of identity confirming personal info in an unencrypted email reply. (bday, last 4 SSN, etc.) I've asked for an alternative way to supply the info and now they are

Fidelity has excellent customer service.  Something a RH user might not be use to.  My advice, open your fidelity account and fund it (if you can).  Then begin the transfer process.  This way you can start investing right away and you wont be held hostage by RH again.

236,IMO, I think 30 days.... You should know that usually they give out large amounts of these certain free stocks and mine went down for (I think) that reason over the next 6 months. They give garbage stock IMO which also goes down because of volume,aquamansneighbor,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/ld4us9/daily_discussion_thread_february_5th_2021/gm53ds3/,0.0,0.884,0.116,0.6597

238,SO," yes I do. Been using them 4 months, no phone support, no email support, failure to transfer my full portfolio, now saying I have $5000 deficit when portfolio was valued over $24000 and cash was over $1500. yet now they are saying I owe them money on a margin call? I never traded on margin or options, was never allowed to. SO yes unfrotuantely I  know from experience , we've all seen how broken they really were. I don't beleive the VLad ceo is bad guy or anything, but the firm is a joke",colinbmerry,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/ld4us9/daily_discussion_thread_february_5th_2021/gm4zmo2/,0.12,0.753,0.127,0.1655
