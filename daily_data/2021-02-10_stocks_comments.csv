If you didn't make money on that initial push to the high 400s, you probably wont make any now as any rise or fall will flag interest again causing shorts to flock back into this stock, what made this play so great was that it was a stealth move that very few people saw coming and it exploded with high volatility like we've never seen before, which wont and cant happen again.

- RH didn't properly manage risk (for years) and were likely waaay over their limits before the weekend and to not lose their license and possibly triggering a market wide collapse, they had to derisk. They made it impossible to buy more, only sell. Not because of some conspiracy, but to survive. This is something you see in finance in times of stress.

- So when people were stopped out (as is correct when you get a margin call), couldn't buy more etc, this was simply because RH couldn't put up more money, which was required immediately. It was stop or wire multiple billion dollars as collateral. Since they didn't have that, they essentially was forced to somewhat fuck their customers
- In finance you constantly get fucked by your broker. It's why you have taped lines and everything is surveiled. This was not nearly as bad as it could have been, but is a crash course for young traders in a little thing called ""counterparty risk"". If the counterparty goes under, you have no one to deal with.

- It was all known that RH has been selling flow since day one, and they're not the biggest at the even. Schwab is. It is also not important in this story, but somehow got roped into it

Only a handful of funds self identify as short sellers and they sometimes publish research to back up their trades. Although it may sound ominous, it's a healthy part of the market and it stops frauds from running amok. But isn't important in this story either
- And no one lost more than Robinhood's owners. The company was valued at roughly $70bn before this disaster and that is maybe halved now, if not more. Also they had to pony up billions in a single day to save the company

28,TDA," >Gamestop is shorted at 78% of total float

For starters, it helps to define some terms since it seems like this post conflates shares outstanding and float.

Shares outstanding are all shares the company has issued. Float is the tradeable shares, that is, shares owned by traders and investors in the market, not those by company insiders.

I see OP's screenshot, but TDA is telling me there is 42.24% short interest, so the 78% is questionable. [Finviz is reporting 42.27% of float shorted](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME)

>while institutions own 206% of all float

I can't find 206% anywhere. TDA's got ~113% owned by institutions.

>as of today’s report. Since there are 144 million shares owned by institutions

If the 206% number were real, it still wouldn't be 144M shares since that's 206% of *outstanding shares*, which total 69.7M. The expectation for % shares owned by institutions would be in regards to float, since that's what they can actually own, and that's what Finviz is reporting in the link I shared. Total float is ~50M shares. 42.27% of 50M is 21.135M. That's how many shares are being shorted.",rassamjubo,3,/r/stocks/comments/lgkknf/gamestop_short_interest_just_updated_it_is_now/gmtkvta/,0.014,0.795,0.192,0.9823

32,GME," Just did the quick math, seems right and matches up with the bloomberg terminals 42%.

However when you do 61million/226%, you get the float they used to get 226% as 27million. So we get 21m/27m = 78%. 

And when we take 21million and divide it by the float we see on different websites of around 47-50million, we land on a short % of 42-44%...

So it appears theres 2 different floats being used, if anyone could comment on this who knows more than me that'd be sick.

37,GME," I think the biggest highlights we should take away are the volatility ""game"" that investors play is what really makes it not worth retail investors doing much.

But we've also highlighted how much retail investors can manipulate the market as well.  Let's be honest, if you thought Gamestop, stock aside, was going to be a big market player going forward with brick-and-mortar in the age of digital delivery, well, you deserved any losses accrued.

There was no ""good faith investing"" on the side of anyone (not that there should be, just putting it in the proper perspective as someone not associated with either side).  People pumping cash into GME weren't doing it because they thought the stock would organically be worth anything.  And those that knew what they were doing were clearly manipulating the market as well (no judgment, it's good that it happened).

It goes to show you how truly detached systems based on large amounts of money are in general.  And how investors and lobbyists have eroded any semblance of a financial system down to ""Who do we want to bury this month?"" and ""Let's inflate/deflate someone's stock just to make a quick cash injection"" repeated over and over again.

39,APHA," Edit: fuck, the first time I get a gold award and it’s for this comment 

Here are some reasons: (1) they missed out (2) they can’t believe something like this happened so they double down on how ludicrous the situation is (3) they’re joining the bandwagon (4) could be shills/bots (5) this one definitely applies to most people: they refused to believe in the hype, so every time the share price increases, they still didn’t believe it:

$50, no way. Then it did. $70? Nope, not gonna try it. $100? So what, that didn’t prove anything. $300? Watch it crash. $400? It’s going to happen. They really kept moving the goalposts and as it went up to $500, it got stopped and suddenly dropped (hard). You know their response was? See, we told you. We told you it was going to happen. Somehow, they ignored the built up, they ignored the multiple halts, ignored the constant media attention, ignored that out of nowhere people were suddenly jumping ship onto silver and the media had headlines about that, and ignored that brokers restricted/block trades. 

The hate towards people still into GME is because they can’t fathom how something like this ever happened. Now look, you can not buy into GME and that’s fine. But other retail investors criticizing other retail investors especially WSB (do people not realize what WSB was before the sudden influx of users?) is really an example of how people on Wall Street can get away with calling for more regulations on others except themselves. That’s just stupid. They can rely on the media to appear on tv and call foul. Somehow they turned your average retail investor against each other.

Second edit: I know there are a lot more perspectives than the ones I listed, but I focused more on the “negativity” aspect in answering the question about why people hated those still invested in GME. The one about people being burned by bagholding and investing more than they should have are very great and valid reasons.

They weren’t hard to borrow, their fees were just super high.

98,KEY," Investopedia for the rest of us says.....”Cross trades are controversial because they may undermine trust in the market. While some cross trades are technically legal, other market participants were not given the opportunity to interact with those orders. Market participants may have wanted to interact with one of those orders, but was not given the chance because the trade occurred off the exchange. Another concern is that a series of cross trades can be used to 'paint the tape,' a form of illegal market manipulation whereby market players attempt to influence the price of a security by buying and selling it among themselves to create the appearance of substantial trading activity.”  

KEY TAKEAWAYS
A cross trade is a practice where buy and sell orders for the same asset are offset without recording the trade on the exchange. This is an activity that is not permitted on most major exchanges.
A cross trade also occurs legitimately when a broker executes matched buy and a sell orders for the same security across different client accounts and reports them on an exchange.
Cross trades are permitted when brokers are transferring clients assets between accounts, for derivatives trade hedges, and certain block orders.

143,CTO," There’s hope, and it’s called market cap.

What’s market cap?

The total value of a company (total number of stocks x price per stock)

So what’s the market cap of GameStop?

If the price is $50, and they have 75 millions stocks, then it’s $3.7 billion.

Now GameStop made $8 billion 2019, and $6 billion 2020 without Q4 revenue. So the revenue can be much higher than $8 billion for 2020.

Still with $8 billion, and a market cap of $3.7 billion, that gives it an evaluation of less than 0.5.

Most e-commerce are around 10-20x. So why is GameStop at 0.5x?

Because people think it’s a dying brick and mortar. But if it becomes an e-commerce, which what Ryan Cohen and the board seem to indicate after hiring an Amazon CTO, than in a year or so it can go from 0.5x evaluation to 10x or even 20x evaluation.

TLDR- GameStop evaluation is at 0.5x, but if it switches model and becomes an e-commerce company, it could go up 20x to 40x what the stocks is worth right now!

This is most probably what happened. Citadel instructed platforms to restrict buying GME, they knew exactly that it's going to cause a massive panic selloff.

Buying under $100 IMO is a good investment, HOLDING for over a year is a great opportunity to profit off the Cohen takeover. Buy and Hold🚀🚀🚀💎🙌",anth1986,10,/r/stocks/comments/lgkm5t/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_3/gms3heg/,0.017,0.704,0.279,0.9798
297,SI," Well, let's take a longer look for a moment. Forget about SI% for a moment and just look at SI. Back in the middle of January, over 70 million shares were shorted. At the end of January, we now know it's about 21 million. So essentially they covered 50 million shares during the crunch. This is the official (self-reported) data. This data is more or less in line with the estimates from Ortex and S3 (within a margin of 10%). Ortex and S3 have been showing a more or less steady short position of 20something million since the beginning of February. 

If the shorts were in a bad position, clearly they would have drawn down their position when the price reached $60 and $50, and eat some losses while they are relatively small. Instead it's all kind of steady going. 

This also seems like a good time to remind people of /u/jn_ku 's [excellent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l97jbo/gamestop_big_picture_market_mechanics/) where he shows the [asymmetrical effect](https://u.teknik.io/DDa8Y.PNG) of SI% on share price as it reaches high levels.

298,GME," You are stating **millions of bag holders**. From the amount of stocks, I heavily doubt that there are millions left. Once the volatility is gone, and GME starts releasing some good news, we will see a slow squeeze. I think reaching a valuation of 20bn in 2-3 years is very much doable. I just think that reading the short interest doesn't make a lot of sense, since those shorts also include the new ones which were created at a higher level, thus shorts that are in fact not ""squeezeable"".

My position currently: 0. I will enter again once I see the stock dropping to around $30, my ideal price would be $20 to build a small position again.

Edit: Just entered again with 3 stocks since short restriction rule was triggered yesterday. Let's see in which direction we head. I'm fine with a drop to $20 or increase to $80.",DarkBlizzard85,3,/r/stocks/comments/lgkm5t/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_3/gmt3p8x/,0.044,0.843,0.113,0.8591

As I've read up on past short squeezes that were acute in nature, the common theme is like you said, a particular event.

303,GME," retail for games is not going to be a huge market going forward. fundamentally, shorting that market doesnt seem like a bad idea. whether anything will happen in the short term i dont know, but in the long run i dont doubt it will go down and likely sooner than the interest rates the shorters have to pay on those shares allow. the reason 'undervalued' is no longer true today, so thats not a risk for them. the shorts will likely hold and not cover their positions. thats what i would do if i was short GME (accoding to the data, the short interest went down...a little). reddit isnt going to prop them up forever either. that's hype and hype tends to die. so everyone is going to get out of GME when something else takes over reddit, then it will fall, then shorts will 'cover their position' and get their payout anyways.",timwaaagh,2,/r/stocks/comments/lgkm5t/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_3/gmtwvxv/,0.066,0.782,0.151,0.9246

Ok so the GME went deep in the red cause I bought at the $300s FOMO stage basically, then bought a couple dips at $60 and [obviously that didn't help.](https://imgur.com/a/gzgk7O4) (Yes I did very bad, but that was gambling money I was ok with).

Is it a better move to just sell my 12 red shares and get a clean slate when this reaches \~$30 to hold long term? I do believe in Cohen/biz overhaul as well. But it's not like those are ever going to get green again. At least not the ones at over $300ish that lost more than 2k. Though when I sell it just sells, it doesn't sell ""just the ones over this price"".

Or just hold a bunch of stuff in the red and add more once it reaches the 30s?

340,GME," I see, thanks for clarifying!

Yeah I mentioned in this post that I don’t want to post my actual GME DD until the squeeze business is over. If I post it now it will get passed off as yet another GME post from a bag holder. There are specific answer to your questions, if you want to get started go ahead and research Cohen’s plans for GME. Gaming is just one revenue stream that will be maintained, but the entire business is completely changing. After the 03/25 ER I think the idea of a big squeeze will have either happened or fizzled and the narrative of what GameStop actually is right now and what they are becoming will become more known. The worst echo chamber I hear out of all of this is that GameStop is a dying brick and mortar retailer that is only in the gaming industry. This isn’t the case. They have increased e-commerce sales 300% and that number will keep rising, they didn’t close stores because they needed the money (although it helped), they closed them because they are moving to e-commerce completely. Physical locations will be for nostalgia, gaming gear, furniture, desktop building kiosks, and hosting esports competitions. They already added TVs to their list of e-commerce expansion and will soon have virtually all electronics on that list, then slowly but surely they will add more and more industries to their e-commerce platform. 

So thinking about the gaming side is good, there is definitely competition however they have several revenue sharing deals in place, but what was once the entire business model is now just one revenue stream.",hooman_or_whatever,2,/r/stocks/comments/lgkm5t/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_3/gmtrkkp/,0.021,0.89,0.089,0.9343
341,DD," Hmm, I think we should save this discussion for when I publish the DD for GME as a long hold. There was no thesis fundamentally or analytically for GME to go bankrupt within a year. Their cash reserve alone gave them a 5 year lifeline. 

Their last ER did not include the console cycle or holiday numbers, they discussed estimates but that’s it. The last ER was for Q3 2020 which was released 12/08/2020, idk how they would include holiday sales before the holidays. The 03/25 ER will be for Q4 2020.

They were closing stores for many reasons.
1. COVID
2. Not profitable or a sustainable business model
3. Pay off debt

These are all good signs of a growing business, not a struggling one. Go take a look at their balance sheet and we can go from there or wait until the actual DD. But you’re making a lot of assumptions that could be disproved with the balance sheet. They are headed in a much more positive direction:

474,EV," I am not a fan of NIO.

NIO has two advantages over its rivals:

- BaaS (imo their best business decision): it makes EV more affordable for the customer. It also dissipates any consumer fears of buying a new car and having to replace the battery a few years later (for a lot of money). But other manufacturers can copy that strategy. In fact, Renault has done it before NIO. Changing from normal car sales to BaaS is a pure business decision, there is no need to change anything on the technical side. Hence, competition could switch quite fast. It is also a very capital intensive strategy, because NIO has to own those batteries.

- Changing batteries instead of charging: This might be useful in the US, but in Europe and China, the biggest EV markets, you usually don't travel long distances. You use your car to commute to work and charge overnight. It is, again, very capital intensive to run those battery swapping stations, as there is no compatibility with other manufacturers. Even if you currently see battery swapping as an advantage, the charging speed of batteries has hugely improved over the last couple of years and will continue to do so. If you can charge your battery to 60% in 2 minutes, why bother changing it? So I don't see it as a long-term advantage.

From what I have read, and I am open to getting updated information on this, NIO doesn't produce its own cars. JAC does it for them and JAC is owned to 75% by Volkswagen, a competitor of NIO that is valued at a comparable price.
To sum up, I see NIO as a hype. I don't see their advantage over other EV stocks, especially now that the old guard has woken up and is entering the market.

It also works with both US and Chinese markets in terms of locations/desirability by the user. 

I also believe that scaling supercharger stations will be much more costly than battery swap stations, which if they caught on could provide a lesser barrier of entry than Tesla had when they tried to do both - eventually deprecating battery swaps - let alone building a network of superchargers.

On what do you base this believe? Battery charging stations will be shared by users of all manufacturers, just like petrol stations nowadays. There are still a couple of different plugs (see article below), but it shouldn't be a problem to install all of them in one charging station. Therefore there shouldn't be additional costs for the car manufacturers.

I knew someone who had a very strict time & target rule: he used to do 20% or 6 months, whichever is earlier. This was about 10 years ago.

His rationale was, if he does 20% two times a year, he walks away with 1.44 times his starting amount. He averaged more than that. He would spend months analyzing each stock he invested in, and never played more than 3 trades at a time (don't remember the split). So he would invest in A, B, C while researching D, E, F. Once A, B, C met his target (20%) he would cash out and invest in D, E, F. And so on...

744,AAPL," It depends. I lock in my profits when I feel like the valuation will stop growing or slow down and I can put that money to another stock that I believe would appreciate more. For example, I bought AMD at the start of 2020 and by the end of the year, I was comfortable selling and putting it towards other stocks with greater earning potential.

That said, most of the securities I buy are not super volatile (other than what transpired 2 weeks ago) and it's very unlikely for say, an 80% gain on AAPL or 100% gain on SQ to be erased quickly. 

My idea is look at how you think the company is doing. Do you think it is doing well and will continue to do so in the future? If not, is there another company that you think is a better investment? Also, don't try to time peaks and troughs. Nobody knows when the top is going to be. As long as you can answer the above questions and are satisfied with your gains, then sell. Conversely, if you think a stock will grow in value in the long-term, then buy. A fluctuation of +/- 10% in the short-term is not a big deal if it grows by a lot more in the long-term.

Let's assume for a moment GME reshapes their store into something of an ""experience"" center and pivots to ecommerce (MS, DIS tried this with their physical stores to mimic Apple with mixed results if I recall correctly).  That can only last so long before you hit a wall.  If successful, others will copy then the competitive advantage disappears.

If I am purchasing online for a console/game etc, then why not just buy direct from MS or Sony?  or better yet, Amazon with my prime and get it the next day?  Is it enough to shift the existing consumers over and add more?  I guess they could use their physical stores as pick up locations which would be the only advantage they would have over the others.

If we then assumed they are pivoting to PC store/experience center.  Well, PC component stores are generally low margin in the past (probably still is).  Unless they get some exclusivity deals (and hence eating further into margins) with some PC component/accessory manufacturer.

$20 billion market cap would put them in similar cap size as HP, CDW, Logitech.

I would love to see it pleasantly surprise me though.  Maybe they can somehow take advantage of their physical locations somehow that gives them a unique advantage over other game sellers.",exkohder,2,/r/stocks/comments/lgvprq/gme_valuation/gmucu2x/,0.03,0.806,0.164,0.9914

Through this transition they are looking to capitalize on their exclusive qnx operating systems. I think BB has really good potential due to the fact that they are also focusing on cyber security.  They didn't get effects by the solar winds hack and are really trying to change the game with both operating systems,  cyber security,  and diving into the autonomous vehicle sector.

It was 4th week before he had his 1st interview. [Excite@home](https://www.forbes.com/2001/10/01/1001excite.html?sh=21f4145455cb). Lucent(AT&T Lab) closed multiple buildings over the weekend posted a sign the engineering & internet offices are closed for good. Go to EDD for unemployment insurance. No severance pay. No warning or announcement. Most were too shocked to sell their stocks since they often dropped 90% in a few days with all sellers no buyers. Many 1000s paper millionaires sold their imports and traded in for a used Toyota put their homes on the market and left.

History repeats itself. During the subprime mortgage crisis, the focus was centered around housing become homeless because one can not afford to refinance, it took two presidents to get it under control and it was global problem this time. One lost may be -35% in stocks for good waiting several years to recover.

1013,AR," I'm aware that mobile gaming is a very large market, but the fact that they already have relative dominance in the mobile space isn't a good thing as they're not translating this into revenue and leaves them with limited space to grow in the market. Either they don't monetize their ad solutions effectively or their ad solutions are inferior to solutions offered by third parties and I can't see either of these as problems that are relatively easy to fix.

I used Unity extensively in education and I would thoroughly disagree with the idea that it's only a matter of time until AAA studios pick it up. From a programmer's point of view, Unity does have a use case over Unreal Engine but only amongst micro-teams. I work on a team of <10 and Unity can feel limiting at times compared to Unreal Engine. 

Amongst artists, designers, and audio techs, the opinion of Unity is significantly worse. The workflows and results in Unreal Engine simply aren't matched by Unity at any point on the team size spectrum and I'd be surprised if over 10% of those people who worked with Unity and Unreal Engine in education expressed a preference for Unity going forward.

Of course, this isn't permanent, but Unity is lagging behind significantly in the medium-large team space and I believe it needs major structural changes in how it develops and utilizes its engine in order to change that.

The 4 examples the author of the TechCrunch article gives as use cases are all uses I think Unreal has the upper hand in. They're primarily visual and have the potential to benefit greatly from Unreal's blueprint system. Unity does have a lead in AR/VR technology but I'm more skeptical on how far away widespread usage of that is than others and they would still need to fix how they monetize growth in that area.

I think that if you're bullish on Unity, you either need to believe they'll massively improve their technologies in the near future, or that they'll improve their ad integration tools in order to increase their foothold in the mobile ad space. I don't have the knowledge to comment on the second, but I see the former as highly unlikely.",Absolut_Unit,2,/r/stocks/comments/lgfk73/bear_case_for_unity_software_u/gmtjg38/,0.066,0.822,0.112,0.9506

I've been doing my DD and I think these are very long term holds.  Basically what you said is that nobody knows 100% if/when they will be able to return to pre-covid operations, especially with new strains becoming more prevalent. They've raised tons of cash with relatively low priced stock offerings, and I believe they even sold a few ships, in what I gather is an attempt to both raise capital and refinance high interest debt.

I see Posh offering to be very similar to EBay with focus on clothes and shoes. But that seems to be a limited market. Also the way to make money is probably not the $20 clothes but the $4k unique and vintage items... Isn't that where eBay comes in though? Like isn't eBay the first place you would look at if you were trying to find something unique/vintage/antique/expensive? 

When I think app based companies helping small businesses, I think of Etsy. Just app wise, I think Etsy is miles ahead of Posh and has a much bigger TAM. I would steer away from POSH.

I didn’t think it was gonna get to 40 in one week but that was part of my decision process. I determined what price I was willing to sell it for making sure it’s above my initial strike.

So my profit is as follows:
35 - 40 = $5 x 100 -> $500

I would've cashed out sooner but I need to wait the T+2...

The minimal returns coupled with the high-soaring stocks being a once in a blue moon thing means I think I just want to diversify. It'll save me hours of studying stocks just to lose $2+ on a $20 investment. LOL! And, before I even do that. I'm just gonna throw my money in a savings account. I'd rather have a guaranteed $400 a month for the next little while than lose my investments because I put it in a volatile ETF.
