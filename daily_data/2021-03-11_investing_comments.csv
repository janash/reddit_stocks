41,DD," My exit strategy will be purely data based. I am glad to talk about this in investing sub as sometimes people outside gme are not aware of some of the amazing DD that has been done. Main points are that hedgefunds never covered. They hid their shorts in etfs and doubled down with more naked shares. There are lots of possible catalyst but something dtcc passed last weekend was an update to liquidity so starting mar 19, the hedgefunds have to provide coverage for their liability everyday. This is their way to cya as otherwise dtcc would be responsible for the payout. 

So when i see a significant volume being traded along with price increase indicating coverage, i will look at my price point i would want to cover(dont want to be specific to influence others) Please understand that 1000 is lowball offer. Hedgefunds have dug their grave and have to cover at the price sold. You might see numbers like 100k in gamestop threads and think people are talking out of their ass but its simply trying to combat the lowball offers we see. This is purely a mental psychological game now how high ganestop goes. Its in every shareholders best interest to hold the shares and keep it out of liquidity pool until there is a catalyst that forces them to cover. Once that happens, its up to each individual to determine their risk reward point. Be greedy and get that money. Even when u do sell, sell in batches and not all at once so you spread out your profit potential. 

There are lot more DD that explain better but i wanted to provide highlight that can quickly catch someone up based on what i know. Good luck and remember the squeeze hasnt been squoze",rajavir,5,/r/investing/comments/m2ok1a/gme_thread_march_11_2021/gqkyqex/,0.068,0.757,0.175,0.988

The total USD supply back then was equal to total gold reserves US had. (This is true for a lot of countries even now). In this scenario, is there really any benefit to make gold transactions faster? Not really. Gold decided the max cap of USD and that's it. It was/is traded but no where near the volume of USD.  

Currently, many global currencies are pegged against USD. Crypto phenomenon wants to take us back to a time when all currencies were pegged to a global asset. You do not need this asset to be traded at high volume since its meant to only decide the max cap of all currencies.

97,IT," > You're not saying anything useful here.

idk what you mean by useful. I'm just describing btc.

>It's a young fast growing asset class with consistently higher lows that disrupts almost every aspect of its 10x market cap competitors.

sure! but that's not a counter argument to it being a bubble or having a cult following.

>In most finance aware groups (like the ones getting into it now) that is called ""undervalued"". 

well sure, it's speculative. obviously someone who invests in BTC is then going to put out statements calling it undervalued, why do you think that is ? XD


>""bubble"" ""cult"" or ""banana"", it doesn't change the nature of the underlying investment.

well sure. I'm not trying to change the nature of the underlying investment, just to describe it.

people relentlessly shill BTC . It's absolutely developed what I'd call a cult following, youll pretty much never find someone long on another asset in as many numbers/as much passion as some of the people who are in on BTC. Part of this is because BTCs underlying value is, well, really unknown in comparison to other assets, it's a totally new concept. However, the underlying idea of convincing others the asset you hold has ever increasing value so that the asset you hold increases your wealth is not. BTC fans are **relentless** in this. 

>""bubble"" 

I think it's a pretty traditionally defined bubble, with evidence of numerous pops.

You are trying to sell me BTC. You don't need to do that, I own BTC, i'm not balls deep on it but I understand the value it can hold long term. I'm just apparently, unlike a lot of BTC owners, capable of seeing the real risks associated with it. There's so much pro-btc propaganda on reddit that really fails to highlight the downsides. Like, nice chart you posted but it doesn't mention downsides for BTC in fair context now does it? BTC is energy expensive. BTC is slow to transfer, expensive. It is replaceable by superior crypto technology that is faster, cheaper, less expensive, scales better and so on. It is not currently stable, which as a currency really matters. These are real downsides. Posting a graphic where the only downside is ""low established history"" is a joke. IT also really doesn't highlight the most important part of BTC- that it was 'first', which really isn't a strong argument for why it's the ""best"" crypto long term.",S7EFEN,1,/r/investing/comments/m2cwjy/goldman_sachs_coo_reports_clients_demand_for/gqlexra/,0.057,0.71,0.234,0.9979

99,CVNA," I agree with you that VRM and SFT are more attractive than CVNA.  CVNA is obscenely overvalued IMO.  CVNA has walmart margins and software P/S.

I think the more interesting question is what advantages do these companies have over Carmax?  Carmax will ship to my house for $100.  They also allow test drives and give money back guarantees.

Used car sales is not exactly a high margin business.  Carmax gets about 20% gross margins.  Carvana averaged 14% gross in 2020. Vroom hasn't even cracked double digits.  Maybe these E-commerce only firms can eek out a little more by cycle maturity with fixed cost & labor savings of over Carmax' online / brick & mortar hybrid model.

I still have trouble justifying the purchase.  SFT is slated to lose $1.50 a share next year with a book value of $3/share.  Working capital and Capex for expansion are huge in used cars.  There will be dilution before they achieve profitability, probably quite a bit of it.Vroom is in better shape, though their SG&A grew faster than revenue this year.  This isn't software.  Expansion is expensive and painful.

None of these firms will be able to achieve profitability with the equity they have today.  There is extreme uncertainty around how much of the pie you'll have when these companies do hit profitability, if ever.

Carmax is adopting the e-commerce model, they already have the infrastructure, positive earnings, positive FCF, and 1x P/S.  You get the potential upside of E-commerce market share without the risk of a company at -30% operating margins and no roadmap to profitability.

106,PS," I'm a believer in SFT for a number of reasons that OP has outlined.  I've been observing the used car market closely over the last 9 months since I initially interviewed with Shift (corporate position) pre-SPAC IPO.  When interviewing, I performed diligence regarding the used car industry and found there have been major increases in used car prices (not to mention that many of the long-term unemployed are inundating the market as they seek cheaper solutions for major assets). Have been holding SFT and VRM in varying degrees (currently hold 203 SFT shares @ 8.81 average and got out of VRM position bc I deemed SFT to be significantly more valuable at current valuations in comparing offerings/tech).  Ultimately it's a great price point for a company with all the capabilities of the vastly more valued Carvana (and VRM to an extent).  I'd say conservative short term upside is $15 range (50% people, you heard me) and there is no reason it cannot continue to grow and take up greater market share long term.

PS tried to buy a used car through Carvana (would have used SFT if they had the specific vehicle I was seeking) and it was the absolute worst service I have ever dealt with.

109,LOVE," Thanks for this! I've considered Carvana because I really do see a future in the business model for buying cars, but I'm worried it is swept up in media hype. This could be a good alternative (is starting to get some hype for the short term but seems to still have value long term).

I really think this will be a huge way to buy cars. I am a lazy millennial (cusp gen z) and would LOVE to avoid the entire in-person sales experience if possible. I also know that I want a new car to be an EV so until I can afford a good one, I'll most likely be doing another used car in the near (ish) future. It wouldn't surprise me if this is true for many others too

I also think large scale purchases are likely as we continue to recover while getting more stimulus money.

Just want to comment on this because this is a fairly common bear case that I hear for this company. While I do think that EVs are the future, this is not going to happen overnight. I do not think it will be the near future (5-10 years) for most people. Also, by the time that EVs dominate the vehicle fleet in this country, there will be more affordable options for regular middle class people to purchase that would be comparable to under $20k used gas car market.

Even with the 25% terminal growth, P/E doesn't get attractive until 2025-26.  That's a long time to wait in a cyclical industry, with a lot of uncertainty in-between.  Not something I'd be interested in.

&#x200B;

On KMX, I think sustainability is the biggest uncertainty.  They have a pretty big finance wing.  In a downturn, not only will they hurt from less discretionary spending on cars, they'll see increased defaults on their car loans (and lower interest rates).  Carmax lost 70% peak to trough in the financial crisis.  It's a precarious business.

&#x200B;

I think KMX is well positioned to enter the e-commerce market, and their valuation makes them the most attractive option in the space.  I anticipate CVNA will have more success in the space and has less sensitivity to economic conditions, but that their price *more than* reflects that.

Most people who buy used cars expect some salvage value on that investment... only the very bottom strata of customers buy cars to run into the ground. The higher end used car buyers who sustain this industry will have a better value proposition to just buy new EVs, especially if there’s any kind of tax incentive (in either direction). 

And these guys are in a tough position. Almost half their total assets are in inventory but they seem to make most of their margins from financing. Why do they have this inventory? Repos?

121,ULTA," > Sephora only sells the fancy beauty the high-life nothing cheap.

I'm not extremely well-informed in this industry, but I'm fairly certain that this is just false. Sephora's pricing may be slightly higher on the average, but they're direct competitors for a reason and you can buy similar products for similar prices at either store.

> Travel retail accounts for 20-35% of division revenue so adjusting for the collapse in travel leads to improved metrics for Sephora. This means SEPHORA IS BACK!

Well....yes. If you adjust for the negative effects of the pandemic, any business is going to be ""back"" through that lens. I can't just say ""adjusting for every negative thing about this company, it's a good company"".

On that note, ULTA is up ~15% from pre-pandemic levels already. So that baseline isn't a great one in this case. It'd be better to discuss why they're better than they ever were, not why they're out of the pandemic because coming out of the pandemic slump is already priced in for them and thousands of other companies.",jkernan7553,18,/r/investing/comments/m2o0p7/ulta_beauty_ulta_upside_in_revenue_outlook_when/gqkf6r1/,0.094,0.801,0.105,-0.0984

I agree that I omitted details on Ulta's improved trajectory post pandemic. Long term upside for ULTA is in market share gains from department stores like Macys. Add in opportunities like the store arrangement with Target. Target acknowledged that it can't compete with it's traditional in store beauty offering and has partnered with ULTA to offer in store beauty.

136,ULTA," i mean, no, that's not really the case with Sephora. you can get budget brands like The Ordinary and Paula's Choice. not sure if you consider those ""prestige"" because they're not in drug stores, but, i mean, these brands are known in the industry because they've made previously hard to access products very affordable. so i'm not sure your dichotomy holds. 

i'm very into skincare/makeup and i'm hugely bullish on ULTA ftr. skincare absolutely blew up in 2020 and now way more people are incorporating skincare into their life post pandemic. while Amazon is a formidable threat to places like ULTA, i think ULTA has a worthy combination of brick and mortar stores and their extensive website to firmly plant their hold on this growing industry. the brick and mortar stores are important because people want to see makeup in person, they want to talk to ""experts"" (i say this with all the love in the world to people who work at ULTA)- shopping for cosmetics is a uniquely gratifying *in-store* experience, and is especially appealing to all the people who are new to skincare- which is a lot. as such i feel more comfortable with their brick and mortar side of things than, say, Gamestop. however, their online store is very robust, with more selection than in their stores. they have an exhaustive list of products that make it so they feel like a one stop shop for *everything* in cosmetics that a place like Amazon may not. I think there's lots of social reasons like these that go beyond the numbers that provide context for why its a great stock.",onceinalifenevermore,14,/r/investing/comments/m2o0p7/ulta_beauty_ulta_upside_in_revenue_outlook_when/gqkk3ls/,0.053,0.769,0.177,0.9907

Cord cutters aren't just people at home, they're businesses too like bars & restaurants that'll be looking for HD streaming and see FUBO as a steep discount to what they used to pay for Cable or Satellite.

This isn't necessarily a negative against investing in FUBO, because the financials speak for themselves, but I will say that I was not impressed with the product and probably wouldn't ever subscribe to Fubo again.

167,MSCI," I've been investing in an MSCI ACWI fund for some time now. I believe index investing is the best fit for me.

I wonder how valuations impact index funds. I had a look at the regional index funds available at my broker and discovered that the ACWI fund has an average PE of 19,52, while the MSCI Europe fund is 16,62. PE isn't the only metric that is lower in Europe, it is cheaper across the board.

My thinking therefore is that I'm buying at a lower valuation by tilting towards Europe, and the expected long-term stock returns should be correlated with the price I pay for them. 

My plan is therefore to keep a tilt, 25% Europe, 75% ACWI, until the valuations converge.

Is my reasoning somewhat correct? Am I missing something important?",RelativeDeterminism,2,/r/investing/comments/m2mury/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gqkbcmc/,0.057,0.878,0.065,0.4808

213,SNDL," Why buy? It depends.

You buy a PUT because you're terrified the price might plummet. Look at the stuff happening over at (SCREW YOU AUTOMOD) right now. It's sitting pretty at $230 or something, but that could change in literally five minutes as we saw yesterday. It's a price built on a house of cards. If you buy a PUT for $200 you might shave a couple dollars off your income, but you also lock in the price. From now until the option expires you will be able to sell for $200 / share. The stock moons to a thousand you sell on the open market. Price plummets you sell against your option. Win-win.

Covered calls are a bit different. They're a way of magnifying your portfolio. For only the price of the premium, you can act as if you own a hundred shares of a stock.

Say for instance the price of a stock is $100 and its premium cost is $0.10 / share @ $100 for a covered call. Now you can drop a hundred bucks and own one share. Stock price goes up by one percent you get a one percent increase on your investment. Stock price goes down one percent you lose one percent.

Or you can purchase ten covered calls at $10 / contract. Each of those contracts are worth a hundred shares, so in essence you've got access to 1,000 shares. Stock goes up by one percent your investment grows by a 1000%. That's how the (AUTOMOD IS A PUNK) monkeys are pulling in millions off their latest pump and dump. The problem is that the premiums involved demand significant swings in a stock price. Unless the stock rises above the covered call's price plus its premium then it's not worth exercising the option.

For example I sold a SNDL option last week for eight bucks with a $1.50 strike price. Now unless it's getting close to expiration, I don't anticipate the buyer to exercise the option below $1.58 SNDL.

Of course buying a put or a covered call can also be part of a larger trading strategy. There are a whole lot of ways to make money off a stock which have very little to do with the price.",Thestoryteller987,2,/r/investing/comments/m2mury/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gqlxxsl/,0.051,0.872,0.077,0.8225

215,CPNG," OK, let's pretend it is literally South Korea's Amazon.

The American (US) Amazon is in fact Amazon, but we have to back out the parts of Amazon that are outside the US.

Amazon's market cap is $1.6tn. Some [70% of its revenues are from ""North America""](https://www.marketplacepulse.com/stats/amazon/amazon-percentage-of-international-sales-13). I'll back out another few percent for Canada and Mexico so that 60% of the value of Amazon is based on its US operations. This gives us 1600*.6 = $960bn for the value of Amazon that is attributable to the US.

The US GDP is $21.43tn and South Korea's is $1.65tn.

So the ""Korean Amazon"" should be worth 960 * 1650 / 21430 = $74 billion.

CPNG has 1.5 billion shares outstanding, so per share that's 74 / 1.5 = about **$49**.

Right now it's trading at **$53.84**.

Uh-oh.

To play it back in my head, you went through the following steps

1. Purchased a $64 call with a $0.65 premium expiring on 3/26.   This cost you $65
2. XOM stock price went up
3. Your call option premium went up and the premium was $1.00 for that price/date.
4. You then sold that option for $100 dollars

Sale ($100) - Purchase Price ($65) = gain ($35).

278,TD," Long story short, I have 110k cash to play with. Im keeping 20k to help supplement my house and car fund. The other 90k I want to invest. My only debt is 8k student loans at ~3% interest, so I literally have nowhere else to put the money as I'm not interested in being a landlord. 

For reference, I'm young (25), so all I've invested these last 7 years is in my ROTH and 401k. My ROTH is 75% VTI/25% VXUS and 401k is a Vanguard 2065 TD. ROTH I max out early January, then don't revisit for a long time. 401k is auto-draw from my paychecks.

I put the 90k into the market all at once at the start of the February down-turn. Allocated it the same way as my ROTH. Basically watched it dip down and down nearly every day. I sold Tuesday at break-even. Now I see the market rocketing back up and am kicking myself, but it is what it is. I listened to my emotions instead of my logic...

The problem I'm having is that 90k is A LOT of money for me. I found myself checking it all the time where my ROTH and 401k I look at maybe once a month at most and almost never think about. It kept me up a couple nights thinking I made a mistake, distracted me at work a day or two, everything. 

Basically, I'm looking for some ideas on how to separate my emotions from logic and if putting this money in all at once is a sound idea. Idek why I'm worrying over it considering I won't need it at all for 25+ years. I think its just the fact im sitting on basically 4 years worth of savings at once has me a bit spooked.

Investing isn't a matter of buying at the lowest price and selling at the highest price.

Buy good companies at a fair price, hold for the long run, don't sell. Example - Facebook was $40ish around its IPO. Bottomed out a little below $20. Anyone who bought day 1 was down 50%.

Investing isn't a matter of buying at the lowest price and selling at the highest price.

Buy good companies at a fair price, hold for the long run, don't sell. Example - Facebook was $40ish around its IPO. Bottomed out a little below $20. Anyone who bought day 1 was down 50%.

308,IMO," He means that the markets are *always* forward looking. So when you hear the news, the price of the stock is already reflective of said news.

Secondly, the financial news media is rife with misinformation so never believe anything or anyone blindly.

Investing is not *that* difficult; there are lots of myths about the small guy not being able to compete but that’s mostly nonsense. 

Find companies you are interested in; have a thesis of why they will make more money tomorrow than they do today; find out if that is reflected in their current price vs their peers.. take small positions and build up over time.

IMO stick to large cap, blue chip companies when you start.  Important noob note here is that market cap is more important than share price.  A $1K share price with 5 shares outstanding = a $5K company.  This is the same valuation as a $5K stock price with a single share outstanding.  Too many people look at stocks and say “it’s expensive” and not look to see how large the company is.

Example:
McDonald’s trades at $215 making it a $160B company. Chipotle trades at $1,425 making it a $40B company.  Of course chipotle is much more highly valued in comparison to its earnings because people expect it to grow faster than a legacy business such as McDonald’s.

Or you could say, forget all that noise and go the lazy investing route of broad market ETFs and not individual companies.
