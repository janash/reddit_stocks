27,AM," Nah don‚Äôt get too cocky. Hedge funds have the ability to cause stocks to shoot up and drop while profiting significantly going both ways. Whenever you hear about a company‚Äôs loss, they can likely manipulate the market to make it all back the next day without getting caught or in too much trouble. Look at what Citadel did with rocket... bought a bunch of puts to cause the price to drop, then bought a ton of calls, then bought a ton of shares which caused the stock price to skyrocket. They likely exercised their options in the AM simultaneously while setting an ask wall with their few million shares. That would‚Äôve given them the ability to sell their shares at maximum price before waiting for market open and killing the price to profit off of the puts.

38,HUGE," I feel like I explained it quite plainly. It‚Äôs the basic foundation of how hedge funds go long on something and then get a hedged position. For instance, if a hedge fund were going to buy 1m shares of something at $45, they would likely buy 2x the puts than the number of the shares, and match the expiration date to the time period they plan on holding the shares. It allows them to stay long with a hedge so if markets turn they aren‚Äôt out ridiculous amounts of money. In essence, they limit their gains by minimizing their losses, but even when minimizing their gains they can profit greatly while staying hedged. It gets the risk assessors off their back, and helps them sleep at night. By forcing movement by buying calls and shares then publicly announcing it, they were able to profit from $20-40 which would‚Äôve been 10x call option price, and during the IV spike they were able to profit on their puts on the way down, while even breaking even on their puts position would have been HUGE. I know because I run a similar strategy to what they did except I don‚Äôt have the money to drive a stock‚Äôs price up. I‚Äôm just in for the ride.",TreeHugChamp,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5behh/professionals_trading_options_vs_wsb_trading/gqzcr99/,0.028,0.821,0.151,0.9777

Why the bots? To make you panic and sell. 

It is a fact that numerous hedge funds have collectively lost billions on this so far. Personally, unless there was more to lose, I'd want to GTFO if I were them. These guys know how to make money on the stock market... why would they waste their time and risk continuing messing with GME unless they have a a lot more to lose here? Why continue to spend time, money and energy trying to pressure people into selling unless there is a. Major upside if they do, or b. Major problems if they don't. Again, these guys know how to play the game, so, it's pretty obviously b in my retarded opinion.

136,GME," EDIT: if these awards are free thank you so much! But please don't waste money on me.

Welcome newbloods! Quick read for you if you're feeling shaky and don't know what the fuck you just got yourself into.

The downward momentum is due to more shorting because long whales and retail aren't selling. Price doesn't matter if HF can't cover because no one is selling. They are in the red right now and unlike people holding, they have to pay interest every single day. This isn't a normal stock, Citadel mutated GME into tendies galore. They illegally broke the system trying to bankrupt GameStop by over shorting, it never should have happened. Yet here we are, and every day the price goes down GME mega thread is downvoted to oblivion, but they can't remove comments and awards. There is no subtlety to their play anymore. They are so fucking desperate any average Redditor who knows jack shit about stocks can see something extremely fishy is going on here just based on Reddit logic. There is no date when the squeeze will happen. Don't be disappointed if it doesn't happen this week or next week. I have seen rumours Citadel thinks apes have an attention span of three months. They will try and kick the can as far as possible. Lowering the price further and further to convince people to get out, selling at a loss even. But if apes simply hold their shares they can't cover. Don't buy more if you are uncomfortable doing so. Just hold what you have or regret it for the rest of your life.

EDIT: the math around the squeeze indicates this is an *infinite* squeeze. Citadel is a $384 billion company and stands to lose *everything*.

They've realized traditional tactics like pushing the price down to induce selloffs aren't working because we aren't investing for traditional reasons. They've taken this time to figure out why we ARE investing, and are responding with tactics that will address our actual reasons.

A big part of the reason people are doing this is entertainment. There's more than that, some want tendies, some want to fuck the hedgies, other people are just in because their friends are in and they're along for the ride... but a part of the momentum is the fact people were having fun. The big pushes downward were having the opposite effect they wanted - they were making it MORE fun, with all the crazy price action. They're attacking that now by reducing price action in any direction.

403,DD," Most meme stocks are between $5 and $30 before they go parabolic.  just doesn't fit the buyer's profile to be paying $300 a share regardless of what that means for the fundamentals.

If GME did a 5:1 split, it'd go to $300 within a week post-split.

I'm still holding some but also happy to keep doubling/tripling my money every month rinse and repeat.  I haven't done any DD on it but don't feel there is the critical mass to force a stratospheric squeeze any more.

464,GME," Except in practice, last time it started to rocket, shenanigans fucked us.

I know some brokers cashed up to stay in the game longer next time but the theoretical limits are well above what they can cover right?

Or have things changed since January more than I realise?

(Other than retail increasing its holdings to like 17+% of available stocks. But I don't trust retail *in general* to not paperhands as soon as they see some real price moment which in practice reduces that 17ish % cuz it'll be up for sale before EOW. So, unless we're positioned to make moves in each direction and keep sucking up shares every down swing, I'm starting to think stimmy action could unwind this play prematurely, or at least drop the ceiling.)

Is there any reason not to scalp these FOMOs over the next couple of days? If I end up holding a larger position by end of Wednesday, will this sort of behaviour fuck things up simply by letting the brokers and front runners help out their MM cronies?

There's probably a lot of money on the line not just to save a few investment banks and hedgies, if this pops there'll be new regulation and then the big boys might lose one of their toys. I think some big players will be more worried about that than the usual movement of money around the market.

&#x200B;

Edit:  down to 3 beers left so I drew some lines on AMC.  No icosahedrons but a definite sine and cosine wave so I set the line color to ""tan"" so that the full set would appear and then ate a tan crayon because I was hungry.  Mostly these just looked cool but don't tell me anything useful.  There's a relatively narrow channel that's trending slightly upwards but volume has been pretty ass lately, although there's a repeating pattern where it starts to trend up for 3 days and then drops for a day for some reason but the drop stops at a slightly higher point than the previous horizontal line.  At least it looks like that but I'm not sure because I've got a shitload of lines on this think so it kinda looks like a zebra now.  Haven't seen anyone here adopt a zebra yet so not sure what that means.  I don't think this is a dip that's happening to buy in and even if it was, the dips are so small that the spread will probably eat up whatever you'd gain by buying the dips so there's no really good way to time this shit.  Still I can buy two shares for less than the cost of two movie tickets so I think I'm bullshit on the stonk for the foreseeable future.

515,GME," You will just get the meme $420.69 or the more retarded $10,000 a share from most people.

If someone does tell you that they have a sell limit set for $350 or something realistic they will get downvoted by the GME gang. 

It all comes down to how much money you want to make (realistically) and how much you are willing to lose.

I do not own any GME stock so I can't tell you what my sell points would be. It would all depend on what I paided for each share. But I would set a sell limit order to sell like 25% to 50% of my stock at and then pick another higher sell order limit to sell the rest. That being said I would also set a sell order on all my shares above what I paided for them just in case there is a massive sell off.

After you set the sell limit price you have to be willing to understand that you may lose out on some gains if the stock keeps going up but at least you made a profit.

519,IT," Or fucking not working since childhood. I started working at 14 part time in high school. I didn't owe money on taxes until I was a senior level IT employee making >80k.

  


Sounds like you've been paying income tax fewer years than many adults (which is awesome and not a jab at you. it is an indictment of any culture that working instead of being a child and focusing on childhood and extracurriculars and development and academics is ever a norm. I am happy for you and think it is good to not work until after schooling if schooling is your path and that family that supports through school or scholarships or grants alleviating the need to work so individuals can focus on growth and development is ideal as it sets young adults up for optimal outcomes and success!)

  


But the knowledge that many people, (I don't have statistics on me but I think I recall from Field Guide To The U.S. Economy that it's well over half. I don't have the book on me, I'm sorry) work through school.

  


So owing taxes every year you've worked is an indicator that you didn't work as a teen or young adult or until you graduated college and had a secure career level job.

  


If you've paid taxes every year you've worked that's actually kinda rad that you got to skip the bullshit and just focus on education and career! Haaahaha brightside!

525,AMC," Oh my bad. I am a dumb ass. I sold 2 covered calls for amc at a $15 strike price. I got 300 shares for around $8.50 each. I set a sell order for the last 100 shares at $20. 

I don't think AMC will get to $20 but if it does and the 100 shares sell at that price I will be happy. 

I also set a sell order for the 100 shares at $12 incase the price falls. 12 - 8 is 4 so it would be around a %50 return for those shares if AMC goes ass up. 

I might do the same for the other 200 shares that are tied up in the covered call after expression of the contracts or I might just sell two more covered calls if the stock is still above $12.",GankaPuss,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5cu0z/so_far_ive_made_more_money_in_the_past_3_months/gr20pwy/,0.089,0.774,0.137,0.7783

Now, the wash sale rule is a fun exception. Like if you cash out 100k from GME shares, then immediately (or within a month) put it back into GME, and then if GME crashes and it turns into 20k, and you sell? Then guess what - you still owe taxes on 100k, because the realized loss of 80k doesn‚Äôt count.

The point is, even if you cash out 100k and put it back into a different stock, you could owe taxes on 100k even if the new stock tanks and you keep hodling.",metalninjacake2,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5cu0z/so_far_ive_made_more_money_in_the_past_3_months/gqzmb0f/,0.071,0.817,0.112,0.7506

622,GME," A real example:

I paid $150 for each $22-strike call on GME back in December.

That's `$150 √ó n` total to harvest the gains equivalent to buying `100 √ó n` shares at `$22` then selling them at `$(much larger)`, instead of needing `$2200 * n` if just buying and holding shares.

That alone was nice ‚Äî <10% the initial capital requirement (or >10x the amount of shares) in exchange for larger downside risk.

Then add in the extra gains due to vega on top of that (which in this case, was far larger than the losses from theta-decay).",suur-siil,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m590bc/alright_the_other_guy_did_an_intro_to_options/gqzy9li/,0.084,0.784,0.132,0.6124

Let‚Äôs say I have $5,000 in my cash account. I purchase $4k worth shares of $DAL. This leaves me with an account balance still of $5000 with $1k of that in liquid cash reserves. 

Now I want to purchase 10x contracts of $AMC.

Most brokers like RH will have you open more complex strategies at the same time, which may diminish possible returns. An example of opening the legs separately on a condor is a good way to see how opening the strat in separate transactions is a smarter idea.

On a huge upswing, you can benefit on selling the call side of the condor while IV and prices are high. If you expect that the stock will downturn shortly after retard gains, then wait for the price to drop back down under your call side of the condor and as the price falls (as you hope / expect) then the put side of the condor becomes more profitable. Or vice versa, on a downswing, sell the put leg and then if you expect it to go back up, then sell the call leg so that you maximize profit (assuming the condor expires in between the legs which is what you want) In the alternative, if you open both sides of the IC on an up or down swing, the other leg is gonna suffer from not maximizing profit.

641,GME," I seeded a new ""stupid high-risk"" account with $3k in December, each GME call cost $150 and ended up peaking at $60k before I sold in the $20k-40k range.

That's the advantage of long options vs buying/shorting stock.

People who bought calls on GME at $300 on the other hand, and saw their calls expire before last week, basically lost everything (whereas they might have made break-even or profit if holding shares instead).  That's a big advantage of shares.

I _might_ be wrong with this following summary, if I am then I apologise in advance to whoever corrects me :)

 - Shares: Delta = 1, Gamma = 0, Theta = 0, Vega = 0.

 - Long options: Delta = varies, Gamma = varies, Theta = dying, Vega = varies.

 - Short options: same as for long-options except theta grows

The difference in upside/downside exposure is also really worth being aware of.  Theoretical vs practical too, e.g. non-pennystock shares are _really unlikely_ to lose 100% practically, whereas options on _any_ stock are more likely than not to lose 99-100% by expiration day.",suur-siil,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m590bc/alright_the_other_guy_did_an_intro_to_options/gr1lr6t/,0.076,0.782,0.142,0.8588

Because they're bots, shills or low quality posts trying to hype AMC with no substance.

No, I'm serious.

The mods are literally trustworthy. They don't take any profits. They COULD have. But to insult /u/zjz was my mistake a few weeks ago and he hit the nail on the head. He risked everything just to maintain the integrity of this subreddit.

So if a lot of AMC posts are being deleted, don't you think that's for a GOOD reason?

It is insanely subtle and it's really pervasive. The number of pro-AMC posts this last 5 days has SPIKED.

914,RH," I‚Äôve read through weeks of their recent apple reviews. It‚Äôs hard to say whether they seem inflated, and yea it looks like people have forgotten about the bad press.

Still that begs the question why the google store rating is 1.7 stars and the app-store rating is 4 stars. That is too big of a difference given the substantial sample size of users on each platform.

My guess of what‚Äôs leading to this difference is that:

1.) More people who liked GameStop and meme stocks use androids and more normies use iPhones. 

2.) the App Store maybe limits the numbers of reviews they publish per day, which would alleviate the effect of a tidal wave of negative reviews over a short period of time. 

3) maybe, big early investors of Robinhood who want to cash out in the first several days of robinhood‚Äôs upcoming direct listing (planned for may) want to make sure they can cash out at an OK price, meaning a 1 star rating on the App Store would be horrible and would lead to every business journal, besides the ones they could pay for a good review, saying that RH seems like garbage.

1358,GME," Okay so doing the rough math. 127.5 million people received the $1,200 stimulus check last year. This time only those making under $75k a year will receive the full $1400 check, and then it diminishes gradually up to the income cap of $100,000/year. Only 9% of Americans make more than $100k/year, so roughly 11,475,000 of the 127,500,00 who got the last check don't qualify at all for this check. Roughly another 8% make between $75k-$100k a year, so 10 million who only receive partial checks. If you average out the reduced payments for those who fall between 75k and 100k and say that this totals somewhere around an additional 5 million or so less total disbursements (again, a rough average) we can say that something roughly like 110 million $1,400 checks will be sent out to the public this time around. 110 million times $1,400 = $154 Billion. 

So in conclusion, we will see a $134,600,000 buy order for GME, accounting for roughly 10% or $15,400,000,000 going into that-which-shall-not-be-named (the digital krugerrand).

1414,NOK," Options trading 101: (fair warning i only figured this out last week so if someone spots an error correct me) If you bought a NOK 5c 3/19 you're basically given the OPTION to purchase 100 shares of the stock at a strike price, in this case: $5.00, by the expiration date: March 19th. You have the right, but not the obligation to do so. Since the stock is currently trading around $4.33, purchasing it at $5.00 today would be truly retarded, but if it happened to shoot up to $7.00 and you had the option which allows you to buy at $5.00, you'd stand to make a profit. You may be thinking, ""wait, do i have to buy 100 shares? thats like, all my bar mitzvah money!"" not to worry dear retard, you can sell the option to another buyer at any time, you don't need to exercise it to make money. Now, purchasing an option that expires in the same week like this one is a sped move, because normally stocks take a while to jump 50%, but with all this crazy shit going on it's completely reasonable to expect it. additionally, intraweek options are a LOT cheaper than more long term options, like a NOK 5c 4/16, which is currently trading at $0.18. the price difference is due to the time factor of options, they lose value the closer they get to the expiration date. ape vocab lesson if the end is all ur gonna read call= betting on it going up, put= betting on it going down",uwucoolflex,13,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5knku/nokia_partners_with_microsoft_google_and_amazon/gr0pzsx/,0.112,0.792,0.096,-0.6842

1416,NOK," lets use the NOK 5c 4/19 option as an example for this to make it easier. if u check robinhood it tells you that its going to cost $0.08. this is called the option premium. option contracts are written in increments of 100 shares, so the total cost to own 1 option contract today is going to be $8.00. the option contracts value here is $8.00, meaning you could immediately sell it to another buyer for the same price as long as the stock price stays the same, and not too much time passes. the premium is where the options value comes from. its worth more when the stock price goes up, worth less when it goes down, and no matter what will slowly decrease the closer you get to expiry. i may have answered your question, but let me further explain exercising the contract. if NOK stock hit $5.00,  the strike price of the call, what does this mean? it means the contract is now given the fancy ape vocab term: in the money (ITM), instead of the bitchmade title OTM. anyway, at $5.00 you still wouldn't make a profit upon exercise of the contract, since u agreed to pay $5.00 x 100 and u already paid $0.08 x 100. so in order for the option contract to be profitable upon exercise, the stock needs to hit $5.09. every $1.00 the stock rises above $5.09 is $100 profit upon exercise.",uwucoolflex,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5knku/nokia_partners_with_microsoft_google_and_amazon/gr1hhq0/,0.045,0.885,0.07,0.4909

1420,NOK," Basically, options require less capital to control 100 shares. So your $500 could with the $5 3/19 expiration example control about 71 contracts, representing 7100 shares. To buy that many shares, you would need close to $31k at the present ask.   


Another angle on this: with $7 you can control 100 shares up until expiration on Friday, leaving your other $493 available to make other moves, rather than committing all of it to one stock.  


What you risk, however, is that come 3/19, the share price is below $5, so your $500 (or however much you put into calls) goes ""poof!"" and you are left with nothing.   


The further out the expiration, the greater your chances of gaining on the contracts, but the slower the reaction of the contract price to changes in the price of the underlying stock. For example: I bought the $4 Jan 2023 calls because I've been expecting NOK to begin making serious moves over the next 1-2 years, so on today's action I'm up all of 11% on my contracts, whereas someone who was in the 3/19 $5 call prior to the open this morning is up 75% right now. Because I went so far out with the expiration, I don't have to face that expiration music for nearly two years (but eventually it could result in all of my tendies going ""poof!""), so I'm not under the same pressure as someone whose calls expire on Friday. I can comfortably sit and wait.  


If you did all of this with $500 worth of shares, since this morning you would be up all of 2.4%, and you wouldn't have capital left over to make any other bets. BUT, you would be long shares and therefore never face expiration wiping out your basis (the company would have to go out of business for an equivalent thing to happen - extremely unlikely). You can sit on the ride for as long as you like without having to keep an eye on an expiration date (and a few other complexities of this options stuff, but this is the key thing that drives the rest).",Aurelius_17_6_313,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5knku/nokia_partners_with_microsoft_google_and_amazon/gr1iwji/,0.016,0.906,0.079,0.9515

Then you're going to have to fiddle with selling and all that. In my mind, I want to make my profit, and go onto the next play. If we're talking about an option on a $20 stock, which is still pretty conservative, you'd have to physically pay $2000, and if you're messing with something like GME, you'll be in the $270000-$30000 range. If I had that money in my pocket, I'd be investing like a normie, instead of gambling with options. There are other nuances, but again, I implore everyone to go learn from a professional.

1684,PM," >I have no clue what uwmc does, but if it does mortgage, you know the mortgage market will go down from here. I don't expect 30y.o. mortgage rates to go much further down than right now.

UWM is a what's call a ""Wholesale Lender"" and they are the biggest in the country.

Imagine, you want to buy a Tesla but tesla doesn't sell to direct consumer but only to small mom-dad ""dealership"".

Same for UWM, they don't deal with customer, they sale their ""rate"" to the ""broker"" (your mom and dad shop around the block. In return, the ""mom-dad"" shop, repackage the UWM rate and sell it you.

Example (over simplified): UWM rate is 3% and it cost you $1k, mom and dad shop will resell you that 3% at $2.5k but rebrand it under their name.

Also, just as far as I know (I work in Fintech for 5 years) wholesale lender and their broker are the biggest affected when rates goes up.

EDIT: I'm getting PM to clarify my last sentence, so I'll answer here:

To simplify it, when rates goes up, Brokers closes their shops, because Loan Officer at the mom-pop shop can't sell as many loans anymore. So Loan Officers, stop working as a LO full time and go work somewhere (e.g traditional front office job) else until rates pick back up again. 

Why is this important? Loan Officer at those ""brokers"" usually only get pay on commission, so they cant work full time, they quit, find another job, which cause the Mom-Pop (broker shop) to close their doors (cant pay fees, operating cost, license, cant maintain volume to get agreement with lenders etc.. etc.)

Brokers closing their shops >>> UWM (wholesale) need to up their point to keep their profits etc.. etc.. it becomes a vicious cycle.

Big Lender that are also Banks (BofA, Chase, Etc..) don't have that issue as they fund their own loan and are allow more leeway with what they offer (it's more complicated than that but you get it)",BigFatAsshole,22,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5c6lq/uwmc_introduction_march_catalysts/gqzceez/,0.047,0.908,0.045,0.1292

1701,GME," They've been proven to be a myth. Some guy came up with them as a theory but you can't actually ""short ladder attack"" a stock the way it was theorized and the only info on this supposed tactic comes from a bunch of random reddit threads where people claimed it was happening. The theory behind ""short ladder attacks"" was that somehow hedgefunds were essentially shorting and selling these stocks back and forth *to each other* to artificially lower the price, which is not at all how the stock market and NYSE work.

In reality they're just shorting the stock the normal way--they borrow a bunch of shares from a broker and then sell them on the market at once--oftentimes coupled with selling shares that they themselves owned and acquired at a lower price. They typically do this when there isn't much buying volume, for example when a stock has reached a high peak after a big run-up (when the order book hasn't had time to build up new levels of resistance), or during times when volume is low, or infamously back in late January when many retail traders had their buying power restricted from buying GME. That isn't a short ladder though, it's just plain-old shorting, albeit big-dick shorting by massive whales, in a deliberate attempt to scare retail investors into selling.

We have TWO major playgrounds against the hedgies. Think of this as a war battleground. Amc and gme are brothers in arms. One is attacking hedgies from the left side and one is attacking hedgies from the right side. We have them in a pincer grip strategy and the hedgies are stuck in between with their pants down.

People who sell gme for amc or amc for gme are reducing the soldiers on each side, giving hedgies a chance to escape out the weaker side. We need both sides to be strong and relentless!",KPop_Teen,37,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5ql83/gme_amc/gr1f1ds/,0.17,0.75,0.08,-0.9156

This is a big one.  Look at GME.  If you spent about $2k on GME last December you could be making $1k-2k *per week* selling relatively safe covered calls.  And that's on top of the value of your investment going up like 1500%.  Looking at it right now, a $400 call expiring in 4 days is selling for over $1k.  For those apes that don't understand options, that means that as long as GME doesn't go over $400, you make over a grand doing nothing.  And if it does go over $400?  You'd sell your shares for a little over $40,000. 

Of course with covered calls you always risk hitting the EJECT button as you watch the rocket blast to the moon, but if I had bought 100 shares of GME back then I would be making 4x-8x my rent each month on selling GME calls, which would be huge for me.

That said, the ratio notwithstanding, the concept is still the same. 

Nokia is undervalued on its on merits, not due to GME. 

You simply buy more shares at a cheaper price in order to move it. The added benefit being with more lots of 100 shares, the more income producing options you have when the shares appreciate in value.

In fact, you could conceivably arrive at a point in the future where the premium you sell on a weekly covered call each week completely recoups your entire original investment in shares.",DOCTOR_CITADEL,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5oe2p/nokia_and_its_infamous_float/gr170jy/,0.015,0.794,0.192,0.9666

>Plus good luck trying to time the market. Chances are if you had bought GME a year ago and sold CCs you would have had your shares called away for $8.

Well if you sell CC's while the rocket is fueling up, yeah you risk losing out big.  I'm talking about potentially selling CC's while the rocket is already in orbit.

Once a stock gets off the ground, you can sell relatively safe covered calls and still make an insane profit if the strike price is hit.  I mentioned the $400 GME call earlier but if you look for an even safer one, a $600 call expiring Friday is selling for over $300.  For that to hit, GME would need to nearly triple in value in only 4 days, and if it does you'd still take in $60k.

So getting in early on a potentially moon-bound stock could be rewarding.

1888,GME," Theoretically if no one is buying or selling then the price of the stock remains exactly the same - the price of a stock is dependent on the price of the last sale to take place. So if volume is very low - meaning very few stocks are actually being traded then it may take longer to both buy and sell stock. 

If I am trying to sell a single share X worth Y and no one is interested in buying I have 2 options. I can put an offer at market price meaning once someone puts a buy offer in, I sell my stock (although this might take a few seconds/ minutes/ longer than I want to wait). Option 2 is I change my sell offer to Y-1%, or Y-2% etc.

Now of course this can work both ways (undercut the price when selling or offering above market price to buy) but because the overall demand isn‚Äôt very high the trend is likely to be the former, pushing the price down because people want to get rid of the stock they have.

That‚Äôs the basic principle but obviously on a larger scale than just me and my 1 stock of X.

Likely, but like I said it CAN work both ways. However historically when the volume of trading drops so does the price so proceed with caution.

Holding made sense when short interest was above 100%, because by the same process as I described in order to buy a stock that no one is selling, you either wait (not an option if your shorted stock has been called) or raise the price you‚Äôre willing to pay. Hence the squeeze.

1893,GME," People think shorted stock needs to be recovered and returned to their owners. The problem lay in their hypothesis because the first run in January probably did catch a few HF by the balls (Melvin) but most can afford the interest rates on borrowed shares and count on prices descending. By the way, while they do that they will short the stock at the top as well knowing they'll make enough to offset borrowed interest rates. Once all yall lose your shirts or attention they'll buy up stock at discount to close positions or most probably did and took a small hit (small to them)

Stocks increase like any other commodity. Supply and demand. If you hold forever the pool of shares to sell become smaller if no one is buying at those prices, it'll come down until the price meets someone's offer.

What's keeping it afloat is these Johnny come latelies buying shares at stupid high prices but they're running out of cash. They're also wasting it on way OTM calls that MM don't need to cover so once they all expire on Friday, the closer OTM stocks they don't need any longer and just dump those millions of shares on the market and make their money. That will also bring the price down unless people keep buying either the shares or closer to ITM calls.

There's no short squeeze or ladder short attack nonsense. There's gamma pressure and that's releasing Friday and the Friday after. By all means keep holding. I need the price to go way up so someone exercises my calls or drop to bottom so I can buy then back and dump GME the next time yall do this.

1895,DD," Thanks for the background on the bonds, notes and bills. The lingo kinda had me fooled for a bit there.

You can see my other previous posts, but I don't see how the economy can support 3%. Even at 1.6%, the repo market seized up like a week or 2 ago because EVERYONE is short the 10y right now (and JPow is hoarding treasuries). My understanding is that the markets are trying to tell JPow to step in and do their Operation Twist by pushing rates up.

There's 2 big things to listen for at the FOMC meeting this week.

1. Does JPow go after the long end to calm fears of inflation (Operation twist). If they do, (like the market wants them to), interest rates fall & tech is happy again.
2. Do they continue the SLR rule or end it early? The SLR rule is really important because it actually *prevents* banks from expanding their balance sheets until April. This was in response to the 2008 crisis. Want to know what expands balance sheets? Fucking stimulus money and new loans. So how do banks hedge against cash *you* deposit? They buy treasury securities (T-Bills to be precise). So then how do they get around the SLR rule with a shit ton of money coming in and no room extra room on their balance sheets? No idea, but I'm sure it'll involve some fuckery in the repo markets and the bond market. I grabbed some VXX last week and I got some popcorn.

This is why I get so frustrated talking to people advocating AMC is going to squeeze.

There's a reason it didn't see gains like GME in January. The same reason it won't see gains like that compared to GME in the future.

Market cap is literally irrelevant to squeeze potential. If the market cap is $300,000 ... does that mean that it has near infinite squeezability?

No.

But you're also glossing over the challenges for $NOK here. 5G is NOT being implemented like everyone just assumed it would be. Governments are scaling back on 5G because people don't even think it's necessary (whether it is or not). Plus a lot of the optimism surrounding $NOK's 5G revolution was that their primary [Chinese] competitors who undercut their prices have been banned from many western government contracts because of national security concerns. Biden has signaled Huweii and the other that they are now in the running and other countries are taking that lead, ignoring the national security issues to save some $$$.

Thirdly, they have built a strong cashflow positive balance sheet and lastly they are announcing partnerships that is only adding to their value. The large float can be moved with the right buying volume. Buying volume is the key. We saw a glimpse of that in January when everyone went in on it before they stopped retailers from buying. It would have easily went to 30 or who knows where the ceiling would have ended. Apple has a float 0f 17 billion and it still moves due to buying volume.

 4/01 24.89$ on my screen shows 2.96 ($296) delta 0.555 gamma 0.067

 4/01 27.89$ shows 2.00 ($200) delta 0.384 gamma 0.058

last underlying price = 25.01

based on these prices (which are the closing prices from Friday, not what it'll open up to tomorrow)

if rkt goes up $1 then:

   24.89$ strike will be worth 351.50 (18.75% increase) delta will become 0.623

   27.89$ strike will be worth 238.50 (19.25% increase) delta will become 0.444

if it goes up 2$:

   24.89$ strike will be worth $413.80 (39.8% increase)

   27.78$ strike will be worth $282.90 (41.5% increase)


if you go deeper otm then the returns just get better and better..

 35.89$ strike +1$ to underlying : 19.77% +2$ : 43.1%

but where things really get better is when there is a big jump, the option's implied volatility increases, which greatly increases gamma and the base premium that the delta is applied to.   If it suddenly jumps a few $ then, I don't know how to calculate what they will be worth, but as long as you choose an option that is highly desired (large volume, large open interest, and the best way IMO to determine, is a narrow bid/ask spread) then the values will immediately jump 100%-300% for each of these, because they have suddenly been deemed plausible.   This is how people got away with buying deep OTM 800$ strike calls for cheap before GME's separate run - basically, the raw numbers made the option traders think it isn't going to happen, though real world activity suggested it could. As soon as GME went past $100 suddenly those 800$ calls looked pretty good and printed even if they were sold right away.

The amount of short interest in a stock is somewhat not as important as its position in relevance to the current share price.

2354,GME," Im going to use fake numbers to explain it a little more clearly and not GME bc it is irregular at the moment. 

Take hypothetical stock XYZ, currently trading at $50 a share. 

You sell a covered call at a strike of $55 (you own at least 100 shares of XYZ so you are ‚Äúcovered‚Äù) for a premium of 1.00 per share, giving you a credit of $100 on Monday. 

On Wednesday afternoon, stock XYZ is trading at $50 per share still. But because it expires on Friday, the probability of it reaching the strike price is much much lower because of the time left to expiration. Because options pricing is all essentially derived from probabilities, the contract that you sold on Monday for 1.00 is now only worth .25 per share. 

You decide, ‚ÄúI am happy with my current gain of $0.75 per share and don‚Äôt want to risk the stock gaining significantly on Thursday or Friday‚Äù so you *buy* a new call, but the same strike and expiration, for $25, in order to close your contractual obligation, essentially shifting the contractual obligation to a new person and letting you exit the position, also known as ‚Äúbuying to close‚Äù. 

From a net perspective, you sold a contract for $100, then bought it back for $25 after theta beat the shit out it and wound up making $75 by doing nothing but waiting 3 days.",scrooplynooples,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5lywo/saw_some_guys_explaining_calls_puts_so_i_decided/gr1nmoa/,0.039,0.833,0.128,0.9473

If I bought GME while it was around 300 and then saw it plummet, I would be out a lot. If I bought a Call thinking it would keep going up, at most I'm out the premium. Granted in the first case you get to still own the shares and wait for it to go back up, but your potential risk remains higher. 

I've only been talking the simple case of buying and selling an option. The market for that option means it is profitable so long as it is ITM, even if it has not yet reached the break even point. The contract itself is worth more than you paid for it. There are many different ways to do things.

I have a secret for you... You know what the end result of GME will be? The most likely outcome is most of the people here end up losing money on it. That is the real reason for those questions, because folks who have watched markets for decades have seen this happen time and time again.

Lie, or be honest, the questions are meant to ensure brokers are not pushing people into trading risky products.

2387,IMO," So much to unpack here.   First... it‚Äôs best not to let your broker manage your options end of life.   You can usually sell them back to capture the gain in the share price, adjusted by the Greeks and what‚Äôs happening around them.   Often it‚Äôs more profitable to sell the option back than to exercise it, as you get the remaining theta and Vega value in the option.   Letting things expire is best done when they‚Äôre OTM and you‚Äôre writing the contract, but even then I like to buy them back at a penny just to close it out and protect against potential after market shifts.

Running options involves a tremendous amount of risk management, and seemingly minor things can sometimes bite you in the ass.   You can have options expire itm but lose money on them due to premium and volatility changes, it‚Äôs entirely possible and happens.

If you‚Äôre still trying to figure out how to buy the contract back then you probably should try out a few trades on paper trading and get the mechanics of your system down before jumping into live money.   Work on a defined risk strategy and know when you‚Äôll close if the trade goes against you.   Learning on meme stocks is not representative of a typical market at all, and making $10k on gamestonk options once does not mean you‚Äôll be successful in the future.   Leverage ratios and max loss should absolutely be defined or you‚Äôre really playing with fire IMO.   I don‚Äôt say that to discourage you but rather to encourage you to take it slow and deliberately as you work out and field test your strategies and learn how to hedge against major losses.",rgar132,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5nkzb/how_is_the_system_still_so_rigged_against_us/gr12jv0/,0.087,0.817,0.096,-0.0412

2473,AMC," The days of valuing assets solely based on fundamentals went out the window when the Fed and Congress started handing out money via helicopters last year. Stop that action and fundamentals might matter. All it takes to run the market is to be the 800lb gorilla in the room. Until WSB, the HFs and institutions had the gorilla position locked up.  
&nbsp;  
Even at today's prices, all it takes is a little over 1,000,000 like-minded smooth-brains with ~$6k burning a hole in their pocket to buy the entire 450M shares in the company. (Let alone when this thing was $2 or $5 p/s). If they truly are diamond hands then the fundamentals will no longer matter. With enough of them piling in with the hope of buying a solid gold PS5 for their wife's boyfriend, they set the price because a lot of HFs/institutions borrowed and sold something that they can no longer buy back to return. In this instance, the weakest smooth brain (including the AMC corporate smooth-brains) controls the share price, not the fundamentals.  
&nbsp;  
Will there be a cliff? Yeah, there always is one. Where is the cliff? I don't know but certainly don't think it is here. AMC shares are still cheap enough to be a lottery ticket that doesn't expire.

Call me an optimist but GME has shown that valuation of a company can come from different angles. I agree that AMC is not GME but I still see a small window of opportunity.

Let's put down the spreadsheets and just look around at the state of affairs. People, for the most part, have been held up in their homes for over a year now. We've gotten slowly accustomed to safer procedures when it comes to socializing (to some extent), and people generally miss 'the good old days'.

Have you ever wondered why the ""people wanna go see movies, stock gonna go up"" crowd never mention other publicly traded movie chains growth potential? If that's the thesis, then why is no one talking about the growth of the entire sector? Other theatre chains do exist. So why flock to the one crippled by debt? There certainly isn't a squeeze play in the cards, it's clear they plan to issue more stock as long as retards are ok overpaying for it.

2504,AMC," I'll give you 2 reasons: 

First, the pandemic has demonstrated that streaming is not a viable alternative to a social night out that includes going to the movies, so people will still want to go to the movies in the foreseeable future. AMC shares were suffering a lot pre-pademic because everyone one was believing the narrative that streaming would have killed theaters. Now we have empirical evidence that people want a night out.

Second, streaming does not even come close to revenues potential for movie producers, so the industry as a whole has a strong interest in keeping the theaters business very much alive.

EDIT: One more thing. As of last week, Chinese no longer control AMC, having sold their majority stake. Leaving politics aside, it's a fact that many chinese stocks are inexplicably low (see BABA). The fact that AMC is a lot less chinese and much more American can only be good for the shares, and ultimately also for the business.

2510,AMC," I‚Äôve tried explaining this same exact conversation to friends before, and even the ones I thought were smart people look at me absolutely blank in the face when I try to explain that actual performance matters, stock dilution matters, etc. 

The reality that many of these people live in is that the actual underlying value of a stock is completely irrelevant and not important. Because at the end of the day, stock prices are all fugazi. Companies are worth whatever we say they‚Äôre worth. A company could be losing $10B, and who TF cares? As long as they don‚Äôt close up shop and we can keep trading it ‚Äî that‚Äôs all we care about.

I think the thing they don‚Äôt understand is that there are NOT a finite amount of shares*. Companies like AMC are adding shares and immediately dumping them to pay off creditors. If even 10% of people buying AMC realized that their $12 share today is at risk of being worth  $4 tomorrow ‚Äî not because we as consumers quit buying it, but because the amount of shares outstanding just magically increased 300%, the stock would tank immediately.

Maybe if we explained it in Charizard cards they‚Äôd finally get it. They‚Äôre worth (idk) 100k because there‚Äôs only 100 of them in existence? Well what if we suddenly found out that the makers of Pok√©mon just issued another 10,000 of them? ‚ÄúHey! How neat is that?! Charizards for everyone!‚Äù Pretty cool that they‚Äôd do that for us, but now they‚Äôre no longer rare. So do you think those first 100 cards would be worth 100k anymore?

*Disclaimer: Literally speaking, there actually are a finite amount of shares, which is equal to whatever amount of shares that a company is allowed to issue, per the agreement set in their IPO. However, companies tend to retain thousands of those shares in what‚Äôs considered to be their ‚Äútreasury‚Äù, and the price of them laying dormant (until they decide to introduce them into the market) are effectively worthless, such that the ‚Äúface value‚Äù of the treasury shares are not up to date with the market value (which would have the effect of not diluting, if they carried those shares at market value). The term they use for the value of unissued shares is ‚Äúpar value‚Äù, which tends to be a fraction of a cent (so it doesn‚Äôt carry much book value), but it when they introduce the shares to the market, the value gets magically transformed into the current market price.

Bonuses to execs make sense when it is based on performance. Not when your share prices jump thanks to reddit or whatnot. Your execs did nothing to help the company. 

 >but would that increase the unit price of the company by raising the employee value?

I also highly doubt that studios are going to hand over streaming rights to AMC, every place and their mother is investing in their own streaming platform for that reason. Granted its better than getting nothing from streaming, but will it make up for an exceed what they could get on ticket revenue?  we'll have to wait for future disclosures since the nature of the universal deal hasn't been released iirc.
