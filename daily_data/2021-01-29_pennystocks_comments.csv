92,AMC," Under the urging of my 16 year old son, I purchased 10 shares at 11.94...and then after watching it for an hour or so, I picked up 10 more at 13.33. (Do yourself a favor, just buy your equivalent of 20 shares the first time and make some more money.)

I will say that I did look at the past 3 years of AMC stock prices and was pleased that even around $12-14  share, it's not at a historical high point. So even if I get stuck with these shares, I think the post-covid hunger to take loved ones to the movies will probably surge the value of movie theaters (and travel, but that's another topic).

The market rallied yesterday as the hedge funds changed the game.  Remember, if they have to cover their shorts the money has to come from their longs ... so you had Wednesday sell off ... then they changed the game and everyone thought they had us beat so the overall market rallied as these hedge funds can keep their longs.  But now that the SEC and law makers are looking at this and everyone is calling foul ... they are in big trouble again as a lot of them double down on the shorts ... market sell of today,

301,AMC," I think people have had their sense or normal massively skewed by GME being shorted over 100%. That is literally INSANE. AMC shorted at ~67% is still incredibly high. The squeeze is unlikely to be as extreme as GME, but it is coming over the weekend and beyond. That is if we hold our nerve and keep it above  9 dollars or so. For those concerned, Of all the stocks that have been touted GME, NOK, etc AMC is in my opinion the safest place to leave your money long, even if the squeeze doesn't go gamma. The only reason it got CLOSE to sub 10 was purely market manipulation, hedge funds selling to one another to drive down the price. This is a decent company that has just received a Billion dollar investment, and looks good to make a decent recovery post covid.

335,HUGE," The biggest test will be how tight we hold once this reaches $20, or close to it. If they can manipulate the price down from there it could cause serious panic selling. They know how many shares were bought in the 15 & up range and how much those people are down currently. Those are the shares they can shake loose the easiest- imo 

If we can reach that $20 area during market hours, weather the storm as it drops waaay back down (10-11 range, maybe lower) and still continue to buy the dips- that’s gonna be a HUGE win. 

I truly don’t know shit. Charts are fucked. Support seems to be in the 10-11 range. Shaky hands are higher up. I feel those are the next target. Allow a lift to the upper teens without much pressure and then slam the price down, make shaky hands try to break even. 

Just a feeling. I don’t know anymore than the neighbors dog. 

Mean dog though.

Edit: if the money you have in here can’t take a 50-75% beating, figure out what you need to do. This is going to be a rough ride. If you like a good fight and want to bloody the lips of these manipulative mother fuckers-  HOLD THE FUCKING LINE !!!!!

Edit : changed my support range from 10-13 to 10-11. It is hard to tell how high the actual support might be because of the manipulation yesterday.

SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze.

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DON'T BE THAT PERSON.

They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DON'T BE THAT PERSON.

SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze.

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

When covid lifts, people are going back to the movies and AMC is going to be the only game left standing. They've got the loan to wait it out, and the initial few months after the vaccine takes hold is going to be a bunch of desperate people missing that big-budget theater experience and social activity.  I'd honestly love to buy more if it dips lower.  Pre-digital rental /sale dominance, AMC was comfortable around 15.  I suspect that it will settle safely at 20.00.

Financials are barren. Down 50% in revenue from Q3 to Q2, nearly doubled operating expenses, not yet profitable. Burns through a lot of cash. Sales decreasing quarterly. Recently offered $100m in shares, leading to dilution. A lot of this could be attributed to COVID however the cannabis cultivation business is a tough one, slim margins and lots of competition.

Based in UK. While UK does have good outlook for the cannabis market, boasting a CAGR of 29% and is estimated to be a ~$37b market by 2027, the main play is SNDL moving into the US upon decriminalization. This is what many people are long on. However, they have many competitors in the cannabis cultivation industry already (canopy, aphria, cureleaf, etc) and it will only rise as decriminalization is passed (which is unknown as to when it will happen). Which brings me to my next point.

The problem with the cannabis cultivation/retail sector is that there is already tons of hype and media coverage over the expected CAGR and growth of the cannabis industry. Many companies are going to be trying to get in on the growth and, in my opinion, it will cause cultivators to cut corners on cannabis growing in order to lower costs to make profit. Demand will force retailers to cut prices to be competitive, and you will have companies fighting to make the best weed. This is already the case in the private cultivation business, where even the top cultivators struggle to grow better weed than home-grown (source: i am a home grower) because it is simply too costly (in terms of trying to generate profit) to cultivate TOP shelf cannabis while trying to sell to an entire market and keep prices competitive. Not saying that every company will have the slimmest margins with minimal profit, because this isn't the case, however this brings me to my next point.

My personal opinion (I am not a financial advisor, just excited for the cannabis industry as a grower myself and trying to provide some insight) is that the most profitable companies in the cannabis industry will be the hands off ones. Ones that do not need to fight to create the best quality or best value cannabis. The competition will be something serious. I am invested in SSPK, the SPAC to acquire WeedMaps (has been profitable for the last 12 years, delivering $160m in revenue 2020 alone), for the reason that they are hands off and do not need to worry about growing it, but they will be the ones in the best place to profit from it (or so is my opinion).

Everyone should absolutely ride the wave - buy low, sell high, make small chunks of money. But holding this long term is a major gamble, especially with how not-so-great their finances are.

Sugar monitoring will always be specialized and will always have to be CGM certified, I would be surprised if apple decided to buy the company and offer it as a package with their watches that would be amazing.

622,A," I do speculative analysis in my professional life, so it helps that I'm already curtailing through a list of stocks every week. I think our approach is intuitive in many ways, but counter-intuitive in a few.

Without going into a lengthy and boring exposition, here are a few key concepts. If a company fails to meet any of these criteria, it's not considered for investment. There are exceptions made for companies in the resource industry.

* 1. **Industry**: The company must exist in an industry where its products and services can rapidly scale
* 2. **Product/Service**: The company must offer a product or service that is unique to the industry or protected by patents and copyright. 
* 3. **Management**: The company must be managed by experienced executives who have a demonstrated history of success in the industry. These executives must also have beneficial access to, or relationships with, other key players in the industry. For instance, if it's a medical device company, the executives should have close relationships with major manufacturers, engineers, or distributors. 
* 4. **Company Stage**: The company must be pre-commercialization. Companies who are still in development provide asymmetrical risk. By gaining exposure prior to revenue, you guarantee that you'll have an open position before the crowd arrives. 
* 5. **Low Volume/Float Ratio**: A low ratio indicates that the company is at a stage of low volatility, where price action is minimal. 
* 6. **Finances**: You need to look at the companies quarterly cash burn, and make sure they have enough capital to carry them through until revenue growth.
* 7. **Partnerships**: Who is the company partnered with? How does that partnership encourage the success of the company? For instance, I opened a long position in TMDI because they have an incentive based partnership with Medtronic, the largest medical device company in the world. 
* 8. **Catalysts**: This is more important for short term traders, who want to enter and exit positions quickly. Is the catalyst 1 month, 2 months, or years away?",thirtydelta,15,/r/pennystocks/comments/l7q5dz/what_is_your_strategy/gla6yd2/,0.041,0.829,0.13,0.9851

624,AMZN," I agree with most people’s posts on what to look for. I am a trained chart technician. So if I see something forming based on charts patterns I’ll enter. It doesn’t matter if it’s AMZN at $3,300+ or a penny stock. They tend to perform the same way. 

I simply scan low priced stocks by clicking through them at a rapid pace. When I see a pattern I write the stick down. I may do this with 3-5 hundred stocks.  

Then I’ll come back and analyze a bit more. Is it a trade or investment? Whats short term target (Daily chart)? long term target  (weekly/monthly chart)? What industry is it in?  Do they MAKE stuff that people buy? Or is it some service industry/local stock/idea company?  

I’m specifically looking for something that the algorithms will move, then looking for longer term play.  I don’t want to tie up capital waiting for something to happen. 

Taking profit:

Some people take 1/2 at a 100% gain and let the rest ride. Others take profit out in 1/3 lot increments.   REMEMBER you can always get back in on another buy or sell setup. 

With options: I’ve found it best for me to take 60-70% of my trade off (If a short term strategy)  on the first major move into the direction I’m trading.  Then put in an order to replenish 1/2 the amount I sold at the same entry price I originally entered.

$DGTW is primed for a swing buy. Oversold recently and court hearing on 2/10. Worth a flip at least. 

Of course $TSNP for very long hold, too much DD to even post here. But that's sitting at 40c (although good time to open position if interested).

745,DD," Thanks!!!  This is why I signed up too.  I like making money, but more than that, I like if I can make money while also having fun and trying to be interesting.  I appreciate everyone's kindness and willingness to share.  I've learned a lot from r/pennystocks over the past year, and I am truly grateful.  People hear have read DD, done their own DD, made money, and paid off their house, their mom's medical bills, student loans, etc.  This subreddit (and others) have saved lives.  Obviously, there are also dangers and cautionary tales to investing money that you can't afford to lose, so my heart goes out to those who haven't been so fortunate.  So, I try to remember that everyone I meet is fighting a hard battle, and I try to respond with kindness.  They say that if you give a man a mask, then he will show you his true face, and the reality is that the internet is a mask that we can hide behind where we can say mean things without much fear of repercussion, but I think that there is real repercussion in how we feel about ourselves after we say something unkind.  Again, I'm not perfect.  I just try to be a better version of myself every day.  Sometimes I succeed, and sometimes I don't, but there is tomorrow.  And I try to remember what I heard that Dave Chappell once said.  He said that most people can be funny, but it might be much more important to be interesting.  I really thought about that a lot because humor can be painful if care isn't exercised.  Humor is a funny thing, right?  Being interesting and funny at the same time is tough, and I try my best, but it isn't easy.  I sometimes see unkind comments on other subreddits, and I often wish that if the person had taken 10 extra seconds, where they could have made the same point, but in a nicer way that would be easier to hear and more able to be pondered and accepted.  Words are important.  And so, I try.  And I am grateful for your comment.  Thanks!  Your kind comment gave me the forum to say this, and I am grateful for that as well.  Again, I'm not perfect.

Thanks for the GOLD. Hopefully Sam (CEO) doesn't let us down and puts out the much sought after presentation and annual report. I've been loading heavily sub-penny and expecting great things from this company.

They have already reduced the OS by 50m and I've heard more reduction is to occur. Regardless the OS is much better than any of those stinky pinkies with BILLIONS of shares.

It's also been made known that there's no toxic funding and no plans on any as well as no RS.

Sam has hinted at generating a ICO which is presumed to be used throughout the MJ market.

Thanks for the GOLD. Hopefully Sam (CEO) doesn't let us down and puts out the much sought after presentation and annual report. I've been loading heavily sub-penny and expecting great things from this company.

They have already reduced the OS by 50m and I've heard more reduction is to occur. Regardless the OS is much better than any of those stinky pinkies with BILLIONS of shares.

It's also been made known that there's no toxic funding and no plans on any as well as no RS.

Sam has hinted at generating a ICO which is presumed to be used throughout the MJ market.

More questions, yay:

Looking to find out if Schwab charges fees on foreign stock trades. Found out that fidelity does - $50 per trade. 

In general looking for a broker I can buy penny stocks through without the commission/fees if possible. Was on TD Ameritrade and $6.95 fee hit me due to app not showing it. 

Curious if anybody has thoughts on either Schwab or Fidelity, alternatively, and if there are really no fees associated with OTC stocks besides if they are foreign companies (on Fidelity afaik). Seems like there are some quirks and drawbacks for each brokerage.

1032,AMD," Take everything you read online with a grain of salt, especially the link you posted from r/investing, and even this very comment. Everyone will have a varying opinion, and those opinions are largely influenced by their personal experience, not objective insight. 

Penny stocks are speculations more than they are investments. You're taking a position in a company that has potential, but has yet to prove its worth. Naturally, this comes with high risk, but that risk also comes with high reward. 

Yes, most penny stocks are worthless, regardless of their market price. The requirements to be listed on the OTC market are very small, and thus questionable companies are able to enter the market with minimal effort. For example, many penny stocks listed on the pink sheets have no obligation to provide the SEC with any information. They submit financial data during their first offering, but that information is rarely updated, and there is no requirement to do so. 

Additionally, most penny stocks have low floats and low volume, so when they experience a burst in price action, the share price can move extremely quickly. This makes penny stocks an appealing destination for pump and dump schemes. 

Now, let's look at the bright side. Just because a stock trades under $5/share (the upper limit for penny stock designation), doesn't mean it's a scam or a bad investment. 

Here are some examples of highly successful companies that were once penny stocks.

Ultimately, I think you have to accept that penny stocks are speculations. They carry a high risk/reward profile, and they require you to do a fair amount of research in order to be successful. With enough due diligence, they can be highly profitable. 

* 1. Amazon
* 2. Apple
* 3. Monster Beverage Corp
* 4. AMD
* 5. Ford
* 6. Snapchat

These are examples that come to mind, but there are countless others.

1037,IT," Penny stocks are for everyone, but you need to know what you are doing. I trade penny stocks for a living since 1997.

First I began my trading career during the IT bubble, when every day I had dozens of stocks running 1000% on news  in a matter of 5 or 10 minutes. It was crazy. 

It was easy to make money, but, it was also risky. I won some, I lost some, but I didn't know what I was doing. It was pure luck.

So I decided to learn Technical Analysis to be able to read and understand the charts. So I used the website [stockscharts.com](https://stockscharts.com) to learn TA. It took me 3 years to find my chart template I use until today, but, after one year I was already making money consistently, a lot of money.

It was like robbing a bank every day. I had many days of making $100K in profits, and my best day I made about $300K.

So anyone can make a lot of money trading penny stocks, but you need to learn TA to know where are the supports and resistances, so you know where to buy and where to sell. If not you are trading blind.

For example in this chart you can see I drew some lines. You need to learn which points you can connect, to use those lines as support or resistance points. You buy the supports and sell the resistances. This way you can maximize your profits and avoid the risk of buying a resistance and see your investment going down right after buying.

1038,TA," Penny stocks are for everyone, but you need to know what you are doing. I trade penny stocks for a living since 1997.

First I began my trading career during the IT bubble, when every day I had dozens of stocks running 1000% on news  in a matter of 5 or 10 minutes. It was crazy. 

It was easy to make money, but, it was also risky. I won some, I lost some, but I didn't know what I was doing. It was pure luck.

1041,CEO," I'm sure everyone has their reasons. I'm new here, personally this is just for fun. My 'real' investments are in more traditional places, I don't have the stomach to be playing around with real money in penny stocks.

It's like going to a casino but no one is bringing me drinks. Only bringing money that I can afford to lose.

I've been trying to do research on the promoted companies here, and yeah, a lot of them seem like garbage. 1-2 people as CEO, CFO, COO; No products, No income; or one I was looking at yesterday was nothing but renderings, no real pictures of the stuff they claimed to make/sell. Some are a massive runaround - this company making stuff for this other company who claims to be acquiring another company who's buying the debt of the first company and so on.

But there are also a few that actually are real businesses. They make things. They sell things. They have physical storefronts and income and employees. 

Money can be made on both.

It’s not possible to make lithium batteries without cobalt and cobalt supply in the world is extremely limited.  Currently, all cobalt comes from Africa and China, with Amnesty International alleging human rights abuses in its production.  Buying from Canada fixes that.  FTSSF has mines and land assets in Ontario and in Idaho.  It recently received 10 million from the Canadian government and directors put 4.5 million in the company by exercising warrants.  They also have plans for a green life cycle, reduced carbon and battery manufacturing.

Many are on the verge of colapse, if not already on life support, and as long as the pandemic is there, it will take at least several cycles of seasons for it to go up. Remember, it's not only the airlines but the entire travel industry incl. hotels, airports, etc that need to go back to normal. From a timeline perspective, I am not hopeful this year will see a pickup, but probably towards 22/23 IF we don't get more corona variances.

After careful consideration, I'd say it's not a buy-now stock, but I believe it has potential to be profitable if the company won't go private and survive this crisis. My modest prediction is watchlist for 1 year and hope for the best.

This post is mostly for a discussion purpose to check if my DD was on-point. It is my first penny stock, which I found during my research that's why I bought a small number of shares. Next time I would just add it to my checklist first.

1175,A," No probs brother!!! Yeah the meme stock stuff while fun is stressful to keep up with if you’re not watching the market all day. The most important thing is to find stocks with catalysts, watch for increasing daily volume on stocks that seems to have nothing going on and are slowly creeping up then ask around see if anybody knows whose loading or why the stock is moving. If everything checks out get it and wait for the fireworks, then sell your initial once you’re up around 50-100% then ride the rest free to wherever you think the top is. 

If you see the same MMs on the bid and ask and they aren’t dumping but it seems like other people are and the bids get replenished, don’t get shaken of your shares cause that’s what they want. If however there is constant dumping and the bids aren’t being replenished and the same MMs are on the ask with 10K stacks then it’s probably dilution, and usually it’s confirmed A/H’s with T-Trades, trades that come in after the market is closed, because OTC doesn’t have A/H’s trading.

The two most important things to have when trading is techs a good chart and L2 that looks clean and you got a banger.",CaptainWeee,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/l82ytn/megh_approved_for_custodianship_to_rhonda/glau8gu/,0.043,0.839,0.118,0.9474
