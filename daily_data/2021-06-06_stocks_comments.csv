Have you ever heard of FINRA? [https://www.finra.org/#/](https://www.finra.org/#/)

They're supposed to regulate all the big boys, but only give them a small fine when they catch them, even if it's for a large infraction that has billions of dollars of implications. It's common for companies to mismark positions as long when they're actually short positions. Sometimes they get caught multiple years later and have to pay a small fine as the ""cost of doing business.""

Fun concluding fact: FINRA as a private corporation has it's own investment portfolios that are managed by the companies that they're allegedly regulating.... Hmmmm seems like some conflicts of interest.

Let's discuss for instance about transparency.

Why is it that, in this digital era @2021, there is no way to identify and diferenciate an IOU from a real share in US market?

Technically is already possible on South Korea.

This transparency level would allow markets to balance themselves (and define where is the limit) and in my mind it is hard to think of a reason that prevents this. Liquidity would not be taken down with transparency that is for sure.

26,SHO," True, the system is kind of a mess (understatement of the year there). Naked Shorting

""Naked shorting is the illegal practice of short selling shares that have not been affirmatively determined to exist. Ordinarily, traders must borrow a stock or determine that it can be borrowed before they sell it short.

Just for anyone unaware, that's the definition of it right there.

Edit: Adding a bit more info to this per SEC

1. Is all “naked” short selling abusive or illegal?  
When considering “naked” short selling, it is important to know which activity is the focus of discussion.  
  
Selling stock short without having located stock for delivery at settlement. This activity would violate Regulation SHO, except for short sales by market makers engaged in bona fide market making. Market makers engaged in bona fide market making do not have to locate stock before selling short, because they need to be able to provide liquidity. However, market makers are not excepted from Regulation SHO’s close-out and pre-borrow requirements.  
Selling stock short and failing to deliver shares at the time of settlement. Rule 204 requires firms that clear and settle trades to deliver securities to a registered clearing agency for clearance and settlement on a long or short sale in any equity security by the settlement date or to take action to close out failures to deliver by borrowing or purchasing securities of like kind and quantity by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on T+4 for short sale fails or T+6 for long sale fails and fails attributable to bona fide market making. If a firm that clears and settles trades has a failure to deliver that is not closed out by the beginning of regular trading hours on T+4 or T+6, as applicable, the firm has violated Rule 204 and the firm, and any broker-dealer from which it receives trades for clearance and settlement, is subject to the pre-borrow requirement for that security.  
Selling stock short without having located stock for delivery at settlement and failing to deliver shares at the time of settlement. This activity may violate Regulation SHO’s locate and close-out requirements, as explained above. In addition, in fall 2008 the Commission adopted Rule 10b-21, referred to as the “naked” short selling antifraud rule. Those who deceive about their intention or ability to deliver securities in time for settlement are committing fraud, in violation of Rule 10b-21, when they fail to deliver securities by the settlement date.  
Selling stock short and failing to deliver shares at the time of settlement with the purpose of driving down the security’s price. This manipulative activity, in general, would violate various securities laws, including Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act.

&#x200B;

“Naked” short selling, however, can have negative effects on the market. Fraudsters may use “naked” short selling as a tool to manipulate the market. Market manipulation is illegal.\[14\] The SEC has toughened its rules including through the adoption of Rule 10b-21 in 2008, referred to as the “naked” short selling antifraud rule, and is vigilant about taking actions against alleged wrongdoers.",JustinMGWF,3,/r/stocks/comments/ntgmud/why_is_having_liquidity_in_markets_considered/h0skzvg/,0.137,0.782,0.081,-0.9912

30,GME," Yes, but that's not a problem of illiquidity. There is liquidity (I suppose, but I don't know much about used cars) just at a lower price point, so you'll be able to sell the car in a reasonable timeframe after lowering the price.

In an illiquid market you won't find buyers just by lowering the price, you have to both lower the price **and** wait to find a buyer.

Also, the concept of ""lowering the price below the fair value"" makes more sense in financial markets rather than for cars. Because of course for cars you can just say that the fair value is exactly the lowered price.

For example, corporate bonds normally have two main factors which govern price:

* Yield ( = interest rate stuff)
* Credit ( = fear that the issuer will default before paying back the bond)

If you suppose that, for example, GME has a 0.01% probability of defaulting in the next year, you'd buy a 1-year bond at a certain price determined by current yields and credit risk. So far so good.

Illiquid bonds have a third factor:

* Liquidity ( = fear that if you need your money you have to wait to find a buyer)

 So, if you had a relatively unknown company, with an illiquid market for its bonds, but with the **exact same** probability of default of GME, you'd still want to pay less for their bonds.

I would argue they should be about double that on fundamentals alone and I think I’m being pretty conservative there.,moonlandings,6,/r/stocks/comments/ntgmud/why_is_having_liquidity_in_markets_considered/h0tfvo8/,0.124,0.723,0.153,0.4767

42,GME," You (and frankly, everyone) should take a look at the story of Brad Katsuyama which describes what HFTs do. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eqqCwhPlyU)'s his presentation at a PRI conference. Tl;rw is basicaly what I said in the first comment- when Brad was trading for Royal Bank of Canada starting from 2007 he was only able to get a fraction of the shares he saw offers for. It turns out his order first arrived at BATS echange, then Direct Edge, then NASDAQ, then NYSE. When his order arrived at BATS high-frequency traders raced his orders to 1) cancel their sell order on the following exchanges and then buy up the shares offered there. They were faster than him, because they had a goddamn underground tunnel dug up in a straight line to those exchanges with fiber cables to send their orders in less than 0.5 ms. Then they would just try to sell them to him at a higher price.

The shit that's going on in the stock market is frankly just disgusting and bilions upon bilions of dollars are just drained from pockets of people every year without them ever noticing it. That's what the r/Superstonk community has found out through the GME saga and we want to raise awareness about this in the public.

44,NBA," Not that they can stop others from implementing it but there is something to be said about first mover advantage. No one is stopping other companies from creating digital gaming stores, and some have done so, yet Steam is still massive.


Perhaps the concept of an NFT is in its infancy, but to expand on where I think it leads to a bit:


As an NFT tracks ownership of the product, you would reach the point that pro gamers or top streamers could sell the cosmetic items they have used. So and so won the world championship in such and such game and now I own that skin. You might scoff, but this is going into game-worn or autographed memorabilia. And gamers are already crazy for collectibles.


This creates an interesting loop:


Players/Streamers/Organizations: Sell used cosmetics for profit

Developers: besides getting a cut on the sale of those game-worn cosmetics will also sell the base cosmetic more as they grab another to ""level it up""

GameStop grabbing a small cut on each transaction for the platform enabling it.


As NBA top shots? has highlights attached to their NFT it's not hard to imagine game developers enabling some sort of stat tracking or highlight attachment to cosmetic items. So a character skin, worn by your favorite gamer who won a tournament with it, or pulled off a nifty play while using it, etc.

My main point is that taxing these companies more only gives governments more power and that they havent proven up till now to me that they even know how to spend this money efficiently. For example, cutting the spending in youth centres/ activities accross the Uk, cutting the spending on NHS, employing subcontractors for works that are not necesary or over paying for works (very common). These are just a few off the top of my head. 

My main point is that government doesnt spend the money efficiently so why should they get more of it for nothing?

Same with if you look at company innovation and potential behind the innovation.

If you want, you can ask questions about why people have faith in the stock, related or not to a squeeze, and ill do my best to provide a good and well founded answer. That or you can just call everyone a nut and ignore it.

112,CAN," But the thing is that it has been academically researched that ETFs are generally the way to go. The French-Fama 5 factors are heavily researched and shown to have had a big indicator of alpha no matter the time period or which country. Over 20-30 years the best way to accumulate capital are ETFs that capture these 5 factors. Not saying stock picking is bad, it's fun and it helps you learn more about the world and you CAN beat the market often. But for risk-reward, ETFs capturing the 5 factors are the way to go. Low-ish risk and moderate to high reward.

And regarding the guy who picked 10 stocks with 9 of them having average returns. I think that is an example of a good portfolio tbh. It's not very smart to base your decisions purely on outcome. Sometimes you make the right decision but the outcome is bad, or you make the wrong decision and the outcome is good. Don't mean you should pick the wrong decision the next time. Also assuming you mean average returns as 3-4% annually, having 9 stocks return that while one mooning would still result in a portfolio that massively beat the market.

133,TV," I would love to get more Google.    They have some incredibly valuable assets yet to be fully monetized. Plus adding new ones.

So for example Google has shared they now have over 150 million active users with Google Classroom.   

But the share price is at all time highs.  Up over 40% so far this year.    There is this mental thing with buying something that is at an all time high.

Google looks to be finally looking at monetizing some of these assets.  Take Google Photos.  They have finally ended the unlimited.  Which had to be a material expense when you consider there is over 1 billion active user.   Turning it into a revenue stream with Google Cloud.   So double whammy good.  Lose and expense and gain new revenues.

One that I think they will do in not too long is stop the ad blocking with YouTube.    YouTube TV it is not possible to block ads.    Google has the technology to end blocking of ads.   It is just a matter of time until Google uses.  Like it was only a matter of time until they ended the unlimited storage with Photos.

I would expect Google to do it gradually.  When they do it will drive more to YouTube Premium.",bartturner,1,/r/stocks/comments/ntbepl/stock_you_want_to_buy_now_or_if_they_drop/h0s9pc8/,0.057,0.787,0.156,0.9584

They don’t magically make more money if a customer switches to EV. If anything Ford will lose money because they now have to divert funds into battery research and manufacturing. 

Furthermore there is no way Ford can keep up with demand for the Lightning. It uses too many batteries (4x as many as a Tesla) and Biden’s EV subsidies are going to make it very attractive from a price standpoint. People will stop buying any trucks at all while waiting for Lightning supply to catch up. Full Osborne effect. Fewer sales means that Ford will have less money to pivot their product lines to electrical. 

The stock price is being artificially propped up by hype and will come back down next year once the supply issues reveal themselves in Ford’s quarterly results.",lacrimosaofdana,22,/r/stocks/comments/ntbepl/stock_you_want_to_buy_now_or_if_they_drop/h0rxcdi/,0.053,0.927,0.02,-0.5279

212,ET," Inflation means that the dollar loses purchasing power, and as such that dollars of earnings have less value for publicly traded companies.  In an inflationary environment, the costs of commodities and common goods will tend to rise.

So pretty darn easy when you actually frame the question relative to what inflation is.  When the value of the dollar declines, you want to own companies that can pass through higher costs to end consumers fairly easily (pricing power exceeding the rate of inflation).  You’d like to avoid companies that can’t adjust their prices but are dependent upon commodities (earnings compression).  You’d like exposure ideally to companies that both benefit from higher commodity prices and can also pass higher costs through easily with pricing power.  This is why people like the energy sector.  If the price of oil and natural gas goes up, ET for instance (my personal pick for the space) will see higher production volumes which leads to increased earnings.  If the dollar devalues they can easily pass their higher costs onto the users of their infrastructure which simply gets passed down to the end user at the gas pump or on their energy bill.  Positive correlation to rising commodity prices plus dominant pricing power by rote of their industry, combined with a yield that is significantly higher than the rate of inflation as well.  Just about everything you could ask for.

This is why you keep hearing people say energy, energy, energy.  It’s a perfect setup for this type of environment and it only gets better once infrastructure spending kicks off.

214,DCF," Sir, tech companies are valued with something called DCF model. The only thing that could throw these valuations off is rising interest rates. So yeah, I have explained what I feel is going to happen. Your question was strategy with high inflation on the horizon. My argument is inflation will be transitory as feds have already started reducing liquidity in the economy by something called reverse repo. So while everyone is focusing on interest rates being low and that leading to high inflation in the long term (not transitory), I believe people are missing the point. 

If you want to have safe assets in times of high inflation land and real estate are the only ones that perform better than anything else during such times. You can argue that the real estate boom or bubble will be inflated even further if that were to happen ( growing in periods of high inflation) in such scenario I am quite sure no strategy can work better than the other as we will probably have a real fire sale like 1929.",hungryWSFool,8,/r/stocks/comments/ntp76w/whats_your_strategy_for_high_inflation/h0t7k1g/,0.071,0.778,0.151,0.9301
215,PEG," You are on the right track as ensuring that your decisions of when to start buying a stock and when to start trimming a stock are based on whether or not the current price is undervalued or overvalued seems to be a concept many people foolishly don’t utilize.

And don’t buy in or sell out all at once, always dollar cost average.

I use many factors in my evaluation; Free Cash Flow Yield, PEG ratio, Debt to Equity, etc; however I almost never start buying a stock if it doesn’t have a 4-5 Star rating from Morningstar and I almost always start selling a stock it’s rating drops to 2 Star.

And in the case of an infinity squeeze, it won’t be funds decided whether or not to close a short position out at x price, their positions will be force closed by the DTCC liquidating them to balance their books. If they have to close 100 naked shorts and the cost of doing so is $10 million, the automated system will do so to make sure their credits equal their debits. I’m just curious, have you read the HOC DDs over on r/superstonk? I know the place is full of memes and seems conspiratorial but the research is astounding in my opinion and clearly proves that GameStop is shorted well over its entire float.

With the short interest in December being over 200%, there’s mathematically no way for them to have lowered it to 21% legitimately with the price going to 350 then now being back to the mid 200s.
