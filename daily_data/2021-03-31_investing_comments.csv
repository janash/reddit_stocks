6,HNW," **Honestly to me bitcoin is one of the most obvious 10X investments that I could think of.**

It's 1/10 the market cap of gold right now (1 trillion vs 10 trillion), but from a technology standpoint it's a 10x improvement over gold.  It's more divisible, more secure, more scarce, can be transported anywhere in the globe in less than 5 minutes.

&#x200B;

""Forget Bitcoin's intrinsic use, no-one ever cared about gold's either. Gold's value comes from its BRAND and scarcity. That brand has taken thousands of years to build.

However, the world is changing fast - one could argue that gold served a physical world well, we now live in a more digital one. The world does move on - I mean, horses were THE mode of transport for THOUSANDS of years - and that ended pretty abruptly.

Now, here's the thing, Bitcoin has gone past a hurdle most of us never thought it would - investment banks are advising their clients to buy it, institutions are buying it, HNW investors are dumping gold and going for it. PayPal, Tesla, Square and so on are buying it. 

This is massive. This is BRAND.

The total value of all Bitcoins in existence is a paradigm shift away from significantly exceed that of gold's, i.e. US$500k a Bitcoin and staying there for a sustained period.

That paradigm shift seems to be happening.""",Okmanl,49,/r/investing/comments/mh6l6f/goldman_sachs_is_close_to_offering_bitcoin_and/gsxdih3/,0.035,0.861,0.104,0.9544

21,TAK," Define 'soon'. Trials are progressing but I'm not aware of any vaccine that has been approved for general use to date. I have shares in Japanese pharmacuetical company TAK and have been following the CV19 vaccine efforts. It looks like slow going there compared to most of the world. EDIT: Did some more searches and I see Pfizer has been approved, and AstraZenica this month? Still, it looks like July before mass vaccination starts.

>>>But Tokyo faces a major regulatory bottleneck due to requirements for local clinical trials before requesting approval. Several other countries have fast-tracked the review process to expedite mass inoculations. A Japanese trial of the Moderna vaccine, which has already won approval in the United States, Europe, Canada and Israel, is due to start this month. Masayuki Imagawa, the head of the Japan vaccine business for Takeda Pharmaceutical Co, told Reuters it would likely take several more months to complete the trial and said securing approval in May was “the best case scenario”. Takeda, Japan’s biggest drugmaker, is a critical component to Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s aim to have enough vaccines for the population by June before the Summer Games, currently scheduled to start on July 23.

>>>Early February: On February 5, AstraZeneca applied for fast-track vaccine approval. Japan officially approved the Pfizer vaccine on February 14...March: AstraZenca's vaccine could be approved in Japan as early as March and the company plans on delivering 30 million shots to the country by the end of the month. July: Treatment for the general public begins.

23,USA," Will comment that the research is solid and theory aren't on the wrong footing. I'll say the main flaw is in your choice of execution.

It's not enough to make a speculative bet on for a number of reasons:

* Unknown future vaccine distribution rates and already infected population. For example: Japan intends to hold the Olympics. They might have methods and vaccines prepared already.

* Tokyo while important is 1 area within Japan. Recent years Japan has invested heavily in Kyoto and Osaka as 2nd/3rd backup business centers in the case Tokyo gets hit with the ultra earthquake. Japan isn't as reliant on Tokyo to keep itself running as say the 80's or even 90's.

* Global investors are backed by every central bank in the world pumping out money. If shit gets bad then everyone will jump in. Buffett is one of those investors who likes Japan's stability and nice P/Es. You don't want to go against the best investors looking for deals backed by infinite QEs from the world's central banks

The other problem is that you're taking too much risk for too little reward. I'll say keep an eye on it. Do some research on names that you like and pick them up as investments if shit hits the fan. Don't be shorting/puts. 

And I'll explain why with another example case that's occurring right now:

Shit has completely hit the fan in Brazil. Much worse than I would expect it to be in Japan. Death rates soaring, not enough ventilators, no vaccines in sight, USA gives 0 fucks about them (unlike a strategic ally like Japan), they don't have the technology systems Japan does, Rio slums density is worse than Tokyo, government services/segments shutting down, government cabinet members resigning, government partisanship splitting the legislative, and calls to remove the President. **EWZ down from 37 to 33.** Would you really want to risk shorting for infinite losses or betting it all on puts with daily decay so you can net a 11% gain betting against global central banks and whale investors who could hold for years/decades? I'm not. Much smarter to just buy the EWZ around 33 and be guaranteed an upside with a potential +50% upside assuming it goes back to pre-pandemic levels. If you want to throw your money away on a YOLO then buy calls or buy EWZ on 1-3x margin. Follow the same formula for Japan.",zxc123zxc123,3,/r/investing/comments/mgwrdt/might_be_a_good_time_to_short_the_japanese_stock/gsxl5rj/,0.117,0.786,0.097,-0.8942
24,UK," Thanks, all good advice. Although re: points 1 and 2:

* Japan currently plans to complete vaccines by February **2022**. 
By their own estimation vaccinations of the elderly will run at a trickle until May and good odds they won’t finish with even that population until July or later. While I’m optimistic, That’s the best case scenario, and some experts have warned the general population will be lucky to get vaccinated before the end of the year.

* Japan didn’t realize their Pfizer vials would require special syringes to get all seven doses until a week before they started vaccinating medical workers.  The big optimistic story in the news is that a Japanese company plans on manufacturing 20 million of them by this time next year. Japan has a population of 125 million.

* I use Tokyo as a reference because I live there, but infections are forecasted to shoot up everywhere and Osaka is even worse.

* About half the infections in Kobe studied recently were mutations. It looks like the UK variant is about to take off here. That will change the infection rate considerably. I think Japan’s luck in dealing with this could begin to run out, and before they make much headway with vaccines.

But I do agree that even if I’m right, the difference in the index might be too small and too hard to precisely time for this to work.",Kmlevitt,2,/r/investing/comments/mgwrdt/might_be_a_good_time_to_short_the_japanese_stock/gsyfoag/,0.043,0.849,0.108,0.9185

This section is very revealing and a good reason to hold ILMN:

""Illumina accounts for the vast majority of NGS instrument and reagent sales in the United States, and its platforms produce more than 90 percent of the world’s sequencing data. With respect to the application relevant to this case—MCED tests—Grail’s rivals have no substitutes for Illumina’s NGS platforms. **Due to the technical limitations of other NGS and non-NGS products, Grail’s rivals cannot use any product other than Illumina's NGS platforms to develop a clinically effective and commercially viable MCED test capable of competing** with Grail's Galleri test""",indie_hedgehog,2,/r/investing/comments/mgwz1w/ftc_files_suit_against_illumina_ilmn_to_block/gsxrmbl/,0.039,0.829,0.132,0.885

While competition is always good for the public at large, from an investing standpoint ILMN’s position seems like a pretty attractive opportunity.",BubbyginkESO,2,/r/investing/comments/mgwz1w/ftc_files_suit_against_illumina_ilmn_to_block/gsxzds9/,0.056,0.751,0.193,0.9621

33,ILMN," Exactly. This FTC complaint is weirdly a huge ego-boost for ILMN. They gave honorable mentions to long-read sequencing (PACB) and TMO's IonTorrent NGS platform, but concluded that Illumina's NGS platforms are the only viable option for the entire MCED market (long read sequencing, however, would be better for whole genome applications in the future, but not the right fit for MCED that benefits from short reads). 

Any company that wants FDA approval for their MCED test, whether it's Grail, Exact Sciences, Guardant health, or any other company, would basically have to perform their clinical trials and provide data to the FDA that was derived from Illumina sequencing platforms. Also, the switch to any other NGS platform later would require them to perform new clinical trials and get FDA approval again, which is too much time and resources to consider switching to another comparable NGS platform (if one exist in the future).

35,ILMN," Thanks for the additional insight. In a round about way this reminds me a bit of the issues with Microsoft back in the day. As basically the only OS option Microsoft was forcing everyone to use their preferred programs - e.g. internet explorer which they owned. They just wouldn’t let other browsers run on Windows. As a result they initially won the “browser wars” by default essentially.


Seems like a similar concern here. The FTC is saying if ILMN gobbled up Grail they can just give all the competitors the Microsoft treatment by just not letting them use ILMN’s sequencing tech which they need to run. Then ILMN, through Grail, would inevitably win the MCED race by default.


Maybe the comparison isn’t exactly 1 to 1 but it shows the power ILMN has on not only the sequencing market but also all the downstream markets dependent on sequencing technology.",BubbyginkESO,2,/r/investing/comments/mgwz1w/ftc_files_suit_against_illumina_ilmn_to_block/gsy5jwe/,0.0,0.942,0.058,0.7543
36,ADP," Good morning contrarians!

Futures are flat as of 0600. Dow, S&P, Russell 2000 all hovering around their close from yesterday. Tech stocks are trying to get off the ground, with the Nasdaq up 0.3%. Bond yields are steady as well.

There just isn’t all that much to move the market. (By the way, notice how quickly we’ve already moved on from Archegos?) Earnings season doesn’t kick off for another couple of weeks and there just don’t seem to be any catalysts until then.

We do have the ADP jobs numbers for March, scheduled for release before the open. 550,000 new jobs are expected. This usually doesn’t move things very much unless there’s major deviation from what’s anticipated.

That leaves us with today’s infrastructure announcement by the Biden administration. Lots of drama around this already, as can be expected from an incoming administration’s first major piece of legislation (not to mentioned the poisoned political climate we find ourselves in).

But details of these plans have (been) leaked out already and frankly they don’t look particularly draconian where tax policy is concerned: Corporate taxes will be raised from 21% to 28%. That’s still well below the 35% level that existed prior to Trump’s tax cuts.

That’s it. Nothing about income taxes on individuals, wealthy or otherwise. Some talk about discouraging tax havens for corporations that I’m sure will be well heeded but ultimately go nowhere.

So unless the Biden administration is hiding its true intentions with this infrastructure bill, there doesn’t seem to be any reason for concern. There could of course be further policy announcements forthcoming. Maybe that’s what the market is worried about. But even then, the Democrats’ majority in the Senate is razor thin.

In the end this whole infrastructure bill may just end up being more PR than anything else. Certainly wouldn’t be the first time.",The_Contrarian01,37,/r/investing/comments/mh1zc3/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gswgjxp/,0.04,0.907,0.053,0.4926

Let me preface this by saying this is not financial advice and my ‘bear case’ does not mean a 40% crash. That said:

1. We’re unquestionably in an exuberant state. Lots of liquidity pouring into markets and very, very few bears outside of the folks who see a cloudy day as a harbinger of doom. Bears have largely capitulated, which makes me nervous.

2. A substantial % of this liquidity comes from new-ish traders (mostly not buy-and-hold types) who are case studies for Dunning-Kruger. I’m not quite sure if this is net-negative or not, but at the very least it is a powder keg. 

3. There is a literal sub for GME. This one feels self-explanatory. 

4. Forward-looking rate hikes/inflation/yield volatility seems to be the only structural thing spooking US equities. This could be viewed as bullish, it could be a blowout year for GDP growth. But the underlying reality is that central banks have pumped just about every asset class there is for years and have accelerated that pace post-COVID. \*If\* real inflation jumps, the FED has backed itself into a corner RE: early rate hikes, no? 

5. Tech is objectively overbought – even proven companies like AMZN are carrying forward EPS of 50x +. Again, this could be seen as bullish, but that seems out of whack for a company that did something like 16% growth last year. 

6. We’re seeing an explosion of nonfungible goods being sold for outrageous prices. An NFT is a JPEG that is valuable because people say it’s valuable. A fiat currency with no stable value, utility, or state support. This emperor has no clothes and folks are pretending he’s wearing bespoke Kiton. 

7. The market seems to be a bit exhausted by the nonstop stimulus and spending, and I see nothing but more of that on the 21-22 horizon. Some of it will be funded via tax increases.

40,AT," Ever invested in an ATM machine and placed it in a business or know someone who has? 

Is investing in an ATM machine a good idea ? I’m 20 years old and have some money to spend on an investment that I can have long term. I know it might not make a shit tone of money when first off, but does it bring in enough to see a return on the investment? I mean, pay myself back and then some. Pretty much until the cash dollar disappears? This would not be my only source of income at all and I would not blow my account investing in this. 
Basically I have a few simple questions: 
- [ ] Would it be worth an investment of about $2,200? As in, making it back and profit with fees and so? 
- [ ] Did you put your ATM in a high functioning business (target, walmart, drug stores, etc)? Or did you go with small businesses or up and coming ones? (Maybe a new hotel or restaurant that just popped up?) 
- [ ] How did you find and/or pick the location of where you want to put your ATM? 
- [ ] Have you seen any return AT ALL? Even if it’s just $100, include how long you’ve had it as well, please 
- [ ] Did you chose the fees or did your company? If you chose it, how did you calculate it?
If you can answer any and/or all of these questions it would be greatly appreciated as I’m just gathering basic knowledge and insight to get my plan BEFORE buying the ATM :).

Demand for gold runs hot when there is either a flow out of other assets, or a concern about cash losing value, or both (and there is always at least a little of both). 

Conditions are pretty much perfect for gold right now. We have both kinds of fear in action, with talk of monetary supply increase and a potential stock bubble. In the past, the cost of holding gold has been that you don't get interest on your deposit, but that isn't a concern at the moment either. 

Regarding inflation, we don't really see CPI or wages going out of control, but asset prices are certainly being pumped by cheap money. Some people claim that absolute asset prices (like houses) don't matter, only the holding cost, but I don't believe them. Both companies and individual's financial fortunes live and die on whether they paid too much for an asset or got a good deal, especially when debt is used for the purchase. I don't believe that interest rates will stay low 'forever'. I do believe that humans are prone to thinking they are in control of situations when they really aren't

Gold's market cap is something like 11T, BTC is about 1.1T, so about 10%, much of it gained in the last few months let alone years. So, BTC and other crypto is definitely undermining gold as the go-to store of value to some extent. BTC has nearly doubled since gold began it's downtrend at the end of Jan 2021, so the rise in BTC alone accounts for nearly half of gold's fall in market cap terms, never mind other 'alternative cash' assets.

The factors supporting a gold uptrend are equities fear, inflation fear, and low holding cost. Those are the catalysts for some kind of change in overall trend.

If the stock bubble explodes, gold prices *will* fall as people lose their fear and go bargain hunting.

If CPI or wages inflation manifests, that would be favourable for gold, but at the same time could result in the stock bubble bursting if central banks slam on the brakes. The situation would be on a knife edge, and unpredictable.

If CPI and wages stay flat but asset inflation continues, well... I think we are in some trouble. One will pull the other but wages will come last. Gold would do well for a while I think, but it could all end up in a horrible mess.

The path central banks are trying to plot out of this mess is incredibly narrow, and needs the right fiscal and regulatory action too.

Last, I will mention that the attractiveness of BTC is a holding cost of gold. If something were to happen that impacted BTC and other crypto, for example regulation, it would be a positive catalyst for gold.",ASisko,7,/r/investing/comments/mh4gbw/my_take_on_golds_longterm_outlook/gsx27ki/,0.131,0.751,0.118,-0.8314

82,IMO," As someone that used to be very bullish on Bitcoin, Past performance does not prove future returns. I can go to any long term chart, cut off the most recent 5 years, and then make an evaluation of a consistent trend for the prior few decades, and there's a good chance the last 5 years don't match it.

The only reason Bitcoin is worth what it is is because of FOMO. People see past returns, want to earn the same returns, so they buy in. I mean who doesn't want to own an asset that has gone up 50x in a few years? It's a very exciting proposition.

As soon as Bitcoin loses its mentality as a ""get rich quick"" scheme, its value will collapse and stay below current highs. Apps like Robinhood have made it super easy to invest in Bitcoin. You have people with stimulus checks stuck at home with nowhere to spend money, so they're dumping it into crypto. They've stuck with it because the gains have been trending up.

IMO Bitcoin will be worth less than it is now in 5 years. There is competition from superior altcoins, and advances in quantum computers will threaten its security.

Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. It doesn't pay a dividend, you can't eat it, it doesn't produce anything, it's literally just 1s and 0s on people's hard drives.

The only ""value"" is that other investors, seeking to get rich quick, are willing to pay for it right now under the belief they will sell it for more later. If this expectation goes away, so will the value. Go to any Bitcoin message board in 2012, it's enthusiasts talking tech and innovation. Go there in 2021, it's all people that have 0 understanding of the technology talking about the price going to the moon.

Pretty much every company that accepts Bitcoin denominates their prices in local fiat currency due to Bitcoin's extreme volatility, and fees to send it are very high.

At least gold/silver have real manufacturing uses so there will be demand for it as long as those products are made.

If overnight the entire market decides no one wants the securities I own and they sell for 1% of their current price, I'll be fine, I'll just rake in the dividends.

92,ASML," Hello,

I am a noob investor from Bulgaria that started investing about six months ago in Trading212. I invest around 200€ per month. My staretegy is completely long term (10y+). I invest only in stocks traded on EU exchanges due to tax regulations in my country. My portfolio is as follows: 85% etfs and 15% picking stocks to goof around and hopefully beat the market

-54% VWCE for whole market -6% IUSN for small cap -25% QDVE for It companies from S&P500 -15% (divided into max 15% a and min 5% per company) Tesla; ASML; ASM; Porsche; Adyen; Varta; Airbus; Allianz; Koninklijke Phillips; Adidas; Puma; Delivery hero; Takeaway; Siemens energy; Be Semiconductors; Shell

Currently my five biggest holdings (approximately 23% of my whole portfolio) are Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, ASML and Visa.

Could you please give me some feedback on my portfolio? Should I drop some of my “pick-and-choose” stocks? Some additional EU companies that I should take a look at?

113,ST," the IRA:  IRAs are either taxed on the way in (Roth) or taxed on the way out (traditional) and not along the way... so don't worry about funds throwing out ST or LT gains.

High turnover should be linked to more long term or short term capital gain style dividend payouts but its not a guarantee, take a look at the history of payouts by the fund in question.

Another way to increase risk for gain: take a look at growth stock ETFs or specific sector ETFs as a way to get further outside of your current zone.

114,GOOG," There are different types of accounts from which you can buy stocks/bonds/etc.

For some types of accounts you have to pay taxes on money you earn. For some other types of accounts you don't have to pay taxes - at all, period. The two investment account types you should learn about:

* Regular brokerage account (this is taxable)
* Roth IRA (totally tax free)

From both of these accounts you can buy shares of GOOG - or whatever you want - but in the brokerage you will have to report anything you earn and pay taxes. On the second one (roth), you don't report any earnings, and don't pay taxes.

I won't overwhelm you with details. But google ""Roth IRA"" and learn about it. A know this: any money you put into a Roth IRA, you can take out at anytime (e.g. if you put in $1000, you can take out $1000 anytime).",goodDayM,1,/r/investing/comments/mh1yrw/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gsybt1q/,0.038,0.932,0.031,-0.0188
115,AAPL," Thank you for this. I see the section called ""Growth Estimates"" and within that ""Past 5 Years (per annum)"".

Are we to take it that this represents the growth in EPS in the past 5 years? Do you know if that's calculated from 2016 to 2020?

It looks about right, using the figures here https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted

$2.08 x 1.0842 ^ 5 is 3.116 which is fairly near to, but not exactly $3.28.

Do you know how it is calculated?


EDIT:

Hmm. It's further off for https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UL/analysis?p=UL
https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/UL/unilever/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted

2.01 x 1.056 ^ 5 is 2.64 but the 2020 EPS figure is only $2.42

EDIT2:

Realised 2016 to 2020 is only 4 years XD.
Still doesn't give the exact figure though if I use 2015 to 2020

$2.31 x 1.0842 ^ 5 = $3.46 not $3.28 for Apple

$1.91 x 1.056 ^ 5 = $2.51 not $2.42 for Unilever

Possibly they're just taking the 5 year % difference and dividing by 5? That gets very close

2.31 + (2.31 * .0842 * 5) = 3.28

1.91 + (1.91 * .056 * 5) = 2.45

121,DD," Nicely structured write-up, but let me make some criticisms:

\-your price target must be contingent on many assumptions especially with such a young microcap company, but you did not explain what those assumptions are or what is the valuation model that you used

\-you did not quantify the intrinsic value of the company predicted by your model and why you think that the stock is currently undervalued and by how much

\-you did not consider technical factors such as current momentum and whether one would be better off waiting more or buying right now

\-you did not do a market study, an estimate of addressable market and an analysis of competitors

\-your DD is weak on analysis of risks. What can go wrong with this company ? What are the valuations that could be predicted in various scenarios ? What are the time scales of those scenarios and their probability estimates ?

\-what (if anything) could provide this company with a competitive moat ?

Imo analyzing a company is a bit like war gaming.
