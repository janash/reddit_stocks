6,TDA, I use TDA already. Because they have the largest selection of OTC and pink sheet stocks of any broker I can find. But Iâ€™m not crazy about the layout of their app itâ€™s a lil plane and hard to use for options,juicebox0709,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/n24ejf/dont_worry_peasants_i_wont_let_the_riches_go_to/gwki50r/,0.039,0.899,0.062,0.2392
7,TDA," I have 3 other brokers I use E*TRADE primarily for Options and speculative stocks and I use TDAmaritrade mostly for OTC and pink sheet stocks And Wells Fargo is also free if you are an existing customer you just add a brokerage account to your other accounts and you can log in just like fidelity or TDA I use Wells Fargo for all of my blue chip stocks like Tesla, Apple, Amazon exc TDA is the only one I pay a fee on and thatâ€™s because Iâ€™m buying OTC and Pink sheet stocks and your gonna pay for those no matter what broker you buy on",juicebox0709,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/n24ejf/dont_worry_peasants_i_wont_let_the_riches_go_to/gwhsnf8/,0.046,0.802,0.152,0.8591
