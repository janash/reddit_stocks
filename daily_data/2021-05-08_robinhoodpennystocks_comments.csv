0,ASRT, It was a great week.  Got the notice of TRCH shareholder meeting.  I’m also excited about ICBU.

3,INTC, I had a bad week and then a wild swing on Friday. Dropped my LTNC early last week for the shit show I saw coming while I was still a couple hundred in profit and picked up some INTC which had a disappointing week but around the same time I got in to GGII and that did really well like I was hoping and it had been before I bought in.,AntAvarice,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/n7rd4o/journal_update_might_take_a_break_and_re/gxenxme/,0.059,0.737,0.203,0.8899
4,ETH," Down a bit in my long stock portfolio from initial investment but my rebalancing seems to be paying off. The pennies I stuck with (TRCH, CTXR) both have been able to make gains. Wish I averaged them down when they bottomed out but oh well. All in all if these pan out and/or we get another batch of Green Day’s, I might just be able to break even.

Regarding crypto, been a real godsend. My long crypto portfolio from Feb has been up a ton and my small swing RBH portfolio has now recouped all penny losses and is up 20% from when I started pennies back in February. Would be up more if I wasn’t taking small amounts of ETH out now and then. Oh well. Should probably get more daring and try swinging more with the cash I got laying on the side. But yeah I think a solid week. Hope small caps resurge before too much longer.

14,GME," Thanks. It sucks to miss out on extra profit each time I shave a bit off the top but I am determined to make back my GME losses on this account and finally struck something that’s helping me regain ground. Won’t be able to just easily ride it up forever so it’s key to lock in some gains so they can be used for stocks again when the time comes while also locking in progress.

15,AXU," I'm finally greeeeeeen.

Holding weird canadian mining companies: AXU and TGB have been rising, so I'm holding that. Will buy them at the dips, and they have good futures as companies.

AXU will be moving a bunch of silver later this year over the next 5 years, and TGB I think got like an approval to be a distributor or something. Idk. I looked it up like 5 ever ago, but the stonks are only goin up. TGB looks like it'll cap at 3.50-3.80. 

Also it's time for Q2 earnings reports, so materials are possibly gonna have unexpectedly high earnings due to the materials shortage. Imma find and look into a cheap materials/mining/auto parts company on ""upcoming earnings"" and buy a bit from my [redacted crypto] profits.

Edit: all this shit is literally so uninformed, btw. I'm just in a vaguely auto/EV adjacent industry and hear about the ""RRREEEEEE NO CHIPS"" all gd day.",chinchillas4fire,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/n7q04o/stock_move_for_may/gxej2u5/,0.091,0.82,0.089,-0.3015
