5,CTXR," I'm up 119% on CTXR and it's really tempting to take the almost $500 in profit (not a whole lot I know but it is one of my first investments and didn't want to go crazy with my money just yet)...but the catalyst I told myself I'd wait for before selling any when I bought in hasn't happened yet.  It feels like if I sold now I'd be going against what I believe about the stock, which hasn't changed negatively - if anything, i'm more confident as time goes on.

I'm not aiming for some pie in the sky crazy high price target, but I think if I can get out at at least 5-6 around the upcoming Mino-lok results I'd be very happy.",PuppyPortal,5,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/o2cl5n/ctxr_taking_me_all_the_way_200_10000_challenge/h272hsk/,0.058,0.825,0.117,0.8678

21,RH," Robinhood only supports the major indexes - NASDAQ, NYSE, etc. So if a stock isn't listed on those indexes, it's not available on RH.

The stocks you're looking for are OTC stocks which are supported on other brokers like TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, Schwab, etc.

The caveat with trading OTC is usually the transaction fees. You say you only want to invest $1 or so, which is fine, but you'll end up paying multiple times that in transaction/commission fees.

I personally think you'd be better off trading RH (or any other transaction free brokerage) pennies to learn.
