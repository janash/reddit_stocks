1,DD," take it out and reinvest it into Clov. Go to the Clov community to check out the DD and or my post history. You’ll easily make more on Clov run up(and overall a great longterm investment IMO) once the shorts stop blatantly manipulating the price from where it would be without hundreds of millions of downwards pressuring from shorting(3 days ago i made a comment explaining all of this as of writing this, and they’re posts in the community with other points and DD). idk from the comments it seems like this company doesn’t make money, and you only lost like 23% of your investment, and you’d be getting in on an amazing average.",Icy_Hyena_9182,-33,/r/pennystocks/comments/om6tb5/i_guess_ill_just_keep_buying_vrme_until_i_own_all/h5j8ioa/,0.085,0.795,0.12,0.7579

5,ATOS," I was really excited about this company around 8 months ago based on some DD here and looked at their website. This was around the time big vaccines started rolling out for COVID.

They had next to nothing in the pipeline. If I recall it was mainly a spray to ease COVID-like symptoms and the breast cancer treatment which wasn't even in phase 3 trials yet. Barely phase 2 if memory serves.

But to be sure, I had a radiologist friend of mine who scans boobs all day looking for tumors have a look at ATOS anyway. 

He kind of just laughed and said it's garbage. Other companies have far more advanced treatments which is kinda what I suspected.",softbear,-2,/r/pennystocks/comments/om6li8/it_is_what_it_is_yall/h5jg899/,0.038,0.818,0.144,0.921

10,SP," Great post. I think we all want the most accurate info here. I will add however, that the last time there was top level warrant activity like this was at the end of December. Just a couple of days later two new patents were announced and the SP spiked. Is that a guarantee that this will repeat next week? No, not at all. But I do feel pretty bullish about this news.

11,DD," They rent space out of an attorney's office in Phoenix, like many small companies that don't need much office space do. Dilapidated is a bit much, but anyway. If you're really sincere about wondering if they show upward potential, I'd do some DD about what they have going on.

12,IMO," Cheers, and appreciate your added info as well. I definitely think you can glean some edge out of these types of filings in some cases, by looking in the past. If the insiders simply get awards every quarter or every year, no correlation to low points in the chart etc., then they're just neutral IMO. But if there are patterns of being awarded at relative lows or before catalysts, for sure something to consider. It would suggest some unscrupulous insiders who I probably wouldn't trust for long term, but I pretty much treat all penny stocks as scams until proven otherwise anyway.",stompingllama,8,/r/pennystocks/comments/olwaoj/celz_recent_insider_stock_acquisitions/h5ipk93/,0.115,0.692,0.193,0.8199
13,DD," I don't this it's a paid basher, just someone that looks at news like this and makes uneducated statements without taking the time to actually  do DD about a company. 

They can't grasp that a medical holdings company that spent it's first five years of being publicly traded developing new, cutting edge technology wouldn't have a big fancy office and that the groundbreaking scientists that are a part of the company wouldn't work at, you know, major universities and medical centers with labs. They'd definitely waste money on a nice office building first. Or that one of them is the first surgeon to ever put stem cells in the human heart and the inventor of Jadi Cell.

14,IMO," Yes, that's right. Disposed of warrants, by way of exercise to acquire shares. This last week was an award of new warrants, completely separate from the end of June exercise. So now he owns 8.9m shares, and 5m warrants. What's not really explained is the basis for these warrant awards and the timing. They're not considered compensation. And it seems questionable as hell that they awarded them the day before a major catalyst in December IMO. If they BOUGHT shares or warrants December 28, that would scream insider trading right? So to be arbitrarily awarded warrants that day doesn't seem any more appropriate in my view, especially since there's no defined schedule or plan detailing when and why they would receive these awards. I can see why these new awards seem bullish now with the context of what happened in December, but if there's a major catalyst in near future that would strike me as blatant illegal activity IMO. I say this with no position, and no knowledge of the company other than these filings we're talking about.",stompingllama,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/olwaoj/celz_recent_insider_stock_acquisitions/h5jnphu/,0.107,0.797,0.095,-0.7523

26,AI," I work in this industry.  Never heard of this particular company, however the need is valid and realistic.

IoT Data transmission over LoraWAN and similar mediums is growing as sensors in manufacturing, cities, warehousing, etc are more in demand.  Naturally, as soon as there is connectivity, immediate demand for “more” data is present.

Risks would be larger companies with more advanced tech dominating this market.  They are NOT the only one in the market and without competition.

I work with one now, won’t name names,,, but with 72 patents on intelligent semantic compression using AI. (Essentially what Atombeam is doing).  Backed by a 500b market cap tech company.  I know, it’s my project.

Although, in an emerging market, there will be many players..this one could very well be valid. Growth potential of an established player adding this tech is trivial, just a product improvement.  Growth potential of a startup like this getting acquired is much greater.

Overall, the IoT market is growing, early in maturity, with lots of crazy bright ideas that are bound to fail while the market matures and the use cases that really make sense are now rising to the top from the chaff.  It will be a major market in the future inevitably.

Just some thoughts.",Random_Timberline,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/om5r4j/i_found_a_new_company_called_atombeam_that_could/h5izpkk/,0.064,0.78,0.156,0.9704
