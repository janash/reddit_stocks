1,ALL," Hi Mauve. Thanks so much for looking into it.

It is actually currently the 15Th best selling Pet product on ALL of Amazon.

It sells out at Walmart as soon as they get a shipment - (its a bestseller with almost 3K ratings in the past 2 months- Look at your link).

Chewy saw the Amazon Success and added it to their inventory - Every shipment sells out right away.

Walmart had it in 581 retail test locations - the demand ""exceeded all expectations"" and the rollout to all 5K Walmart retail locations is happening  Q2.

So it was only in 10% of Walmart locations But soon will be close to your place as well ;)  - check out other zip codes.

So to get it straight - It is a BEstseller on Amazon, A bestseller on Walmart, A bestseller on Chewy just added to Shop Rite and it is targeted to be in 20K retail locations by Summer.

What you described above is why the record revenues are going to continue to climb and POOPH alone will bring BioLargo to profitability.

You can read more about it in the POOPH section of my recent BIOLARGO post here (BTW a new subsidiary and even better numbers were announced since the post):
