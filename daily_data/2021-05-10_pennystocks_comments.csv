https://www.otcmarkets.com/filing/html?id=14845271&guid=2nLnUnmVG-17Qyh

Their fleet is old, and it looks like they didn't make any money in the filings leading up to the pandemic.  They exclusively fly CRJ 200s which are not loved by travelers.  Keeping the planes on the ground made 2020 profitable as United had to pay them to not fly, at the same time reducing their expenses.  United amended their agreement last year, absent specific details I expect that same benefit does not roll forward.  IMO, don't even try to project anything off of earnings here, 2020 was an aberration that likely saved them from a trend towards bankruptcy, they may have 0 revenue by 2024.

They skimped on maintenance, took the CARES act subsidy as a negative operating expense to benefit operating expense by about 70+M (a guess based on historical maintenance not truly knowing what planned maintenance was for 2020) - see page 39 of the 10-K and make your own conclusions.

They have a substantial amount of debt.  Recent transactions to acquire old planes in full for series C preferred shares (see page 43 of the 10-K for details), I don't think this benefits common share holders on a book value/liquidation basis.  As noted in this DD the aircraft were worth 1.x million.  3 planes with engines plus 5 additional engines sold to Southshore (loosely affiliated?) were awarded about 13.2 million.  Each plane has two engines, so at 2m per aircraft (higher than the 1.x) that would value the engines at 1.4M which is greater than the cost of the aircraft.  Either this was a supremely shitty deal, or the value of the aircrafts is basically negative and any remaining value is based on the engine conditions, which will continue to deteriorate.

Delta is planning to cease to fly the CRJ 200 in 2023, same time the United contract potentially expires, not sure what the value of the planes will be when another carrier is marketing the same planes for sale at the same time.  The cost of parts and maintenance will likely go up as volumes of supported planes diminish.

Conclusion: They have an old fleet of planes and little bargaining power.   They were more profitable when they were on the ground.  Due to their current contract they must maintain their fleet and cannot sell a significant portion.  The small amount they earn over the next two years doesn't look to be enough to rebuild a fleet of new aircraft, pay severance to laid off employees (pilots get certified on certain planes), etc.   You probably shouldn't base the value off of earnings, just on liquidation value.  I don't know what the liquidation value is of 20+ year old planes, but my guess is far less than this valuation would imply.

I will not be holding your bags sir, best of luck.  I hope they can evolve/pivot and that you're right, for the sake of hundreds of jobs.

United has CRJ-550's being flown by GoJet, which are 50-seat CRJ-700 airframes with a lot of extra legroom and passenger comfort features, as well as a bunch (over 100 on the certificate but not all are flying) ERJ-145's over at CommutAir. The ERJ does not have hard limitations in terms of hours/cycles like the CRJ-200 does.

With the industry going away from 50-seaters, the Air Wisconsin CRJ-200 contract is definitely expendable. They *do* have CRJ-700 on their certificate, but United regionals are limited to a certain number of 70 seat airplanes by the scope clause in mainline United's pilot contract.",srv340mike,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/n8o45e/air_wisconsin_otc_hrbr_the_undiscovered_airline/gxlkwia/,0.025,0.816,0.16,0.9518

Or does the IRS track each share individually, so I simply sell 100 shares next January and the remaining next June?

76,OR," Can you explain the reason the profit sharing is so fractured?  Tantalum is split between the miner ?khyber or something like that 70/30 which makes sense and mentioned on PR's.  What doesn't make sense is then there are some debentures given out last year (links at bottom) stating the holders get 30% of that 70%?  That is just plain odd.  Those are just the ones I quickly saw so maybe others are out there as well lowering the returns further?  Also, those same debentures states the holders have the right to convert to auxico shares OR the private company Central American Lithium.  I have NEVER seen that before.  Does that make any sense to anyone else?  

It seems to me this whole stock was made as a way for the guys owning Central American Lithium to use public equity (thus public take on the risk of acquiring the minerals) and then funnel all the processing $$ through their private entity which they keep 100% of that revenue.  Any comment or am I way off on this?  

There is almost no discussion on this stock on the net so hard to get an understanding what is going on.  They don't even have a investor presentation on their website.
