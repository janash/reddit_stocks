Please be vigilant as his account is only 4 months old which was created around the first squeeze in January. His analysis may be right on the triangle but be careful that you don't sell early. 

Over on the GME specific threads the theory is that a small fake squeeze will be initiated and that a total unknown hedge group Glacier is being margin called as a scapegoat to make retail think they won. This small squeeze isn't the real squeeze and people should hold. The stock by itself with changing over to a e-commerce model should be valued much higher than where it currently is anyways.

209,AMC," 20 dollars is pre-covid value is it not?  You guys think AMC is fundamentally sound company of having the ability to bring in crowds of people like it was pre-covid times?  I'm not slicing one way or the other, honest question about it.

Personally I'm someone who used to always go to the movies and I just have no more taste for it, but that has more to do with holywood more than it does to do with movie theaters.  I don't live in big cities but given how much content the big companies like Disney is pushing on their online stores (Disney+ with Marvel and WB content on HBO Max) which I have been keeping up with it just seems that movie theaters as they once were would find it hard to find that market value.

I would think 15-16 sound about right with a board that has a vision for post-covid world with streaming becoming big (someone was saying instead of big theaters selling just movies doing some sort of deal with gamestop to experiences to smaller groups of people with simulated big screens of whatever kind of entertainment).

I just haven't heard what they plan to do and I don't see any movie lineup this summer that is going to pack any theaters and sell concessions like it used to.

I was long on UWMC before the squeeze potential popped up.

I am not opposed to holding UWMC long (depending on the price) after this.

I was long on UWMC as my second-largest holding before the squeeze/gamma/whatever potential started and will be long on them again (once again depending on price, I am value-focused),

However, if the price rockets to $16 I won't jump back in until 10ish or so.

My guess, is they are actually doing Due Diligence of their own and have realized we've been bandying around the IBKR numbers, so their trying to mask their movement a little. With that said, at the end of the day only 45-50k has been been returned to IBKR leaving a very significant amount left over. They haven't really begun to cover.

Finally, if you're going to sell your shares, and are cognizant of the gamma squeeze for the love of god sell deep ITM covered calls instead.

That's a 17% increase in UWMC.

Before maturity, much can happen, but the delta is 0.5.

If there is a ""squeeze"", he will cash in.  If there is ""normal"" activity, I'm not so sure.  If the stock goes up by $1 again soon, that would work out as well. 

As a counter example, a Jan 22,  6c at $3.10, with a break even at $9.10, has a delta of 0.8. If the stock goes up by $1, the option would gain more. 

From a ROI perspective, the short term OTM costs only $1, while the long term ITM costs $3.10, but there is a lot more wiggle room.

657,AMC," So much wrong with this I don't even know where to begin.

Dark pools are not illegal, and there's not any proof that it has been illegally manipulated like the cult would have you believe.

Buying at the market price is not illegal manipulation, but it *does* have an effect on the price. Massive buy orders push the price up, even if they're below the market price, because other people trying to buy are forced to either wait until that massive buy order fills, or they have to place their buy orders at a higher price if they want it filled. But buying large amounts of stock is not illegal.

As for no short squeeze ever happening when social media was involved, what do you call what happened in January? That was a short squeeze, no? Idk how you could think social media wasn't involved, unless you think Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube don't count as social media.....

I don't see how anyone can read AMC's 10Q and like the stock. If you think there's potential for a squeeze then that's one thing, but looking at the company's fundamentals for even a brief moment shows that it's complete dogshit.

But even if you think there's a squeeze potential, it gets a LOT harder when there's massive share dilution like AMC has done. They've literally quadrupled the number of shares in the past year, they just issued 43 million more, and they still have an additional 30+ million they're authorized to issue. All of that makes it easier for shorts to cover and harder for retail to buy up the float.

So it's hard for me to be jacked to the tits on this pile of shit. If you make money off of it then congrats, but I'm gonna sit this one out.",Logpile98,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nff5e4/amc_brings_new_drama_to_the_stock_market/gylqw3p/,0.073,0.807,0.119,0.9377

723,IMO," My reply wasn’t very substantial. Your remark in hating to live off unemployment, a lot of people love it, along with disability.  Any “free” money really. Anecdotally I’ve seen these systems gamed.  In these people they seem to have no desire to better themselves and are happy remaining static, puddles collecting dirt, rotting into further debility. 

One lady in particular comes to mind, magnifying her pain and symptoms 10fold around hospital staff to get the needed signatures for disability.

The majority though, IMO, are trying to get out of a hole or what not and do want to improve.

But if you were suddenly making more money by not working why the fuck would you go back.

UWMC has potential to do that.",covidtimecommenter,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nf1xrj/why_is_rkt_dead_to_wsb/gym4qzo/,0.03,0.868,0.102,0.6369

932,RKT," TPO has even lower margins than retail so not a good thing if TPO is growing faster than retail (which it is). UWM tried to make brokers sign an ultimatum to say they can’t work with RKT (and because of their market share have a class action lawsuit pending; there’s another class action too for retroactively changing early payoff policies at UWM but that’ll be a 1-2mm settlement at most). Regardless, this ultimate is slightly hurting RKT as well. 

Also, housing market is hot for sellers because their homes are asking for more than their worth. But in reality there is a shortage of houses on the market, and because so many people locked interest rates so low, many are holding onto properties rather than selling even when moving or purchasing new homes.",Iddub,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nf1xrj/why_is_rkt_dead_to_wsb/gyjcft1/,0.094,0.82,0.086,-0.0635
933,RKT," The market is really expecting interest rates to rise and loans to fall. Confirmation bias kicked in when RKT reduced earnings guidance. Homes, auto, and personal will grow, but likely not enough to offset the decline in loan revenue over the next 6 months.

938,RKT," They issue mortgages and finance them by issuing debt. Look at financing cash flows and long term debt growth in the balance sheet. It looks like they aren't appropriately amortizing the cost of capital to back the loans (which should probably be counted as COGS or D&A), so it shows up as higher earnings than it really is in the income statement, hence the low PE. I haven't done a deep dive on RKT to see exactly what they're doing, but it looks fishy from the cash flow statement.",Squatomatic,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nf1xrj/why_is_rkt_dead_to_wsb/gyjhpyn/,0.07,0.891,0.039,-0.2013

941,CRM," I can’t attest to their balance sheets, I’ve yet to look that deep into the situation, but yes 95% of the time UWM has the best rates available and the processors at the brokerage I work at go through UWM. They have a great A-Z system in place for loan originators. Literally A-Z from training people with no experience in the industry through their UWM Success Track, to importing the 1003 file (loan application), to CRM System, to great wholesale rates, to everything inbetween. The CEO knows what he’s doing. It could be the Zillow of Mortgage lending in the end, in that it obtains so much power that it starts running brokers the wrong way how Zillow has done realtors. But for now it’s great so long as it keeps ultra competitive rates and easy to use systems",joshstc,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nf1xrj/why_is_rkt_dead_to_wsb/gyjdm2x/,0.041,0.74,0.219,0.9875

946,GM," September will start ticking upwards where it will start getting attention

I was hoping it would drop one more time so I can buy 1000 more at $10. My average is $10.00 don't want to buy more and increase my average shares price

But every penny, every dollar is making me cash.

I receive messages from let's say an unconventional way was urged to buy so I did I bought $20K and just sat on it, knowing the up downs, but eventually it will pay off..

Tesla was same for 11 years but difference with Nikola German government has backed Nikola and GM has 20% stake..

I listen to every message I receive and I tell everyone.
I've been absolutely right on every coin and stock by the date.

I told everyone 15th Of May be sure to buy before spike, it will drop in June but only briefly 
If you don't buy by September your F'd

Sister bought 10,000 shares when it hit $9.45
My savings account was earning nothing.

In late 2023 Nikola will reach $923.00 a share
