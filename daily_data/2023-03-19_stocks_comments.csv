13,OR," You’re looking at it the wrong way. 

Bankers don’t lend to the high risk first, they will lend to the risky when the low risk borrowers have been depleted. OR the lender will likely do something predatory if they are catering exclusively towards the sub prime market. Insane tracked on fees and rates up to usury laws. 

I think a lot of the wrought stemmed from the loss of actual local community banking.

24,UBS," Swiss here. We just spent a family afternoon with Raclette and white wine ranting about this. Fuck Credit Suisse in its current form with a broomstick, but that offer by UBS is just insulting. They know exactly what they are doing, and they will get away with it. What an absolute shit show.

A press conference by the Federal Council has been announced hours ago, but nobody knows when it will happen and what will be discussed. Rumors are going wild. Credit Suisse has rejected this ""offer"" and people say if UBS will not acquire it by Tokio opening, this will result in the government acquiring it by other means. How exactly this will happen, nobody knows. There are some insane scenarios.

On Friday, speculations were on the way about Zurich Cantonal Bank (ZKB) intervening and acquiring it, backed by Cantonal, Federal governments, as well as national banks (not just the SNB). Internationally unknown to most, it is already one of the largest Swiss banks with a small international presence, and is considered systemically relevant by European and international standards (enjoying double state guarantees by the Swiss and Zurich government, as well as de facto European guarantees because this bank going down would be like a nuclear blast), and is deemed one of the safest and most stable banks in existence. At current valuations, it would absolutely be feasible, but they'd ask for further state guarantees for their intervention. This would immediately make them one of Europe's largest banks.

$edit: It was just announced that the press conference will be held shortly after 6pm local time, after informing key players about the result of the negotiations. Woohoo...

40,UBS," I believe your options will be converted to equivalent options in UBS stock based on the acquisition price (since it's an all stock deal). E.g., the underlying deliverable might change from 100 shares of Credit Suisse to, say, 2 shares of UBS at the same strike price. So if the deal closes your puts should be well in the money when the markets open, and you shouldn't have any trouble exercising them since UBS's stock would still be traded on the open market.

&#x200B;

 Understanding Payment-In-Kind (PIK) BondsPayment-in-kind is used as an alternative way of paying cash for a good or service. With a payment-in-kind bond, no cash interest payment is made to the bondholder until the bond is redeemed or the total principal is repaid at maturity. It is a form of mezzanine debt that lessens the financial burden of making cash coupon payments to investors. On the dates when the coupon payments are due, the bond issuer pays the accrued interest on the PIK debt by issuing additional bonds, notes, or preferred stock. The securities used to settle the interest are generally identical to the underlying securities, but on many occasions, they may have different terms. Because there is no regular income, investors seeking cash flow or regular income should not purchase payment-in-kind bonds.PIK bonds typically have maturity dates five years or more and are unsecured, meaning they are not backed by assets as collateral. Companies that issue PIK bonds may be financially distressed and their bonds may have low ratings, but they normally pay interest at a higher rate. Because PIK bonds are an unusual and high-risk product, they mainly appeal to sophisticated investors such as hedge funds.",marsap888,3,/r/stocks/comments/11v80br/bond_question/jcsdvz5/,0.102,0.792,0.106,0.2538
183,PIK," Just trying to make sense of it all, without offering any specific advice, because I haven't looked into the company in details:

The company is not doing well, and its credit rating was [downgraded](https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-downgrades-Diebolds-CFR-to-Caa2-outlook-negative--PR_466235#:~:text=New%20York%2C%20May%2020%2C%202022,rating%20to%20Ca%20from%20Caa1.) for a number of reasons.

They have renegotiated the terms of their bank debt with bank lenders, most likely to avoid a covenant breach and default, and to get more time to turn the business around. Banks probably accepted this restructuring to avoid a liquidation, but may not be able to increase their exposure (i.e. lend more cash).

The company is therefore not sure they'll be able to repay or refinance the Notes due 2024 (which you're holding), and took the initiative to negotiate with the largest institutional noteholders for an exchange (on substantially the same terms they're offering to you now) in 2022. Over 80% of the noteholders (large institutions) have accepted these terms (probably because the alternative was insolvency and a loss).

PIK means that your interest/coupon on the new notes will not be paid in cash (because they're kind of strapped for cash right now). Instead, they intend to pay you the compounded interest in cash only at maturity in 2026. However, PIK Toggle means they may try to pay cash interest/coupon if they can, but most likely at their discretion. 

You've also missed the March 5th early bird deadline for the early participation premium of $50 (meaning you'll only get $950 per $1,000 of notes).

We can't advise you on the best course of action now. What is clear, however, is that if you don't accept the exchange, you'll be one of the stragglers (part of a subset of the remaining 20% of noteholders that still don't accept the exchange). And it's unclear whether the company will be in a position to repay you at par next year. You may have to take a loss on your principal.

Then again, you bought those bonds at $74 cents. The company could repay anywhere between $0 and $100. On that point, I'm sorry I don't have a view.

Are you ok to take that risk, or would you rather take the chance (like the 80% noteholders and the banks) that the company can turnaround? In which case you'd be rewarded with an 8.5-12.5% compounded return (on $95 cents). Or would you rather take your chances that they're able to repay $74-100 next year?",Balthazar130,2,/r/stocks/comments/11v80br/bond_question/jcsipf1/,0.07,0.847,0.083,0.8832

Hell, my twitter feed is now filled with political or AI newsletters/threads from people I don’t even know.  Facebook is filled with misinformation.  Instagram is filled with influencers and fake AI crap.  TikTok is being investigated for potential foreign spying.  Content is exploding like never before, and it’s all fake skill-less smeary nonsense that doesn’t mean anything.  Fake influencers, fake artwork, fake voices, fake photos, fake everything.  Why should we care about it anymore?

You’re right to wonder where this is all leading.  It’s like how NFTs just completely over saturated themselves and fizzled out.  Now we are seeing that with social media in general.

189,AI," I feel this way especially with apps like Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, etc and less so with apps like YouTube. The former already seem very fake and materialistic, and as these generative AI technologies become more advanced and accessible, I can see a world where people just become so disillusioned by the fake reality these platforms are creating and become more connected with the real world. 

I can't even really comment on this because I don't use those platforms to begin with, but I could imagine that people get so bored of seeing these pictures and videos of things that aren't even real, people going places and doing things that they never did, people that don't even exist posting selfies and going on trips, fake models, fake influencers, fake everything.

Whereas with other platforms like YouTube, I feel like those will be affected to a lesser extent negatively, because I use YouTube a lot for informational content and to learn things and be engaged with interesting topics rather than to just keep with where this person went on vacation this summer or where that person went out to dinner last weekend.

Ironically I could also see a world where generative AI might even make social media more addictive for people. The algorithms know exactly who you are, what you like, and generate content specifically for you to engage you. Imagine fake TikTok videos generated to be hilarious or extremely interesting just for you endlessly.  Imagine some TikTok live stream of some person that isn't real (but you think is real) creating amazing content that you find extremely engaging, think about all your favorite aspects of live streams and YouTube content used by the algorithm to create content that is captivating for you. 

I could see gaming benefit tremendously from this, as people could have video games and virtual experiences generated that are catered directly to a person's interests. these things are currently not a reality, but with the rate of technology advancing, I certainly see these things being possible by the end of the decade",yikesthismid,0,/r/stocks/comments/11v8ik7/negative_impact_of_generative_ai_on_social_media/jcs2bsb/,0.078,0.761,0.161,0.984
