**Outlook Therapeutics (NASDAQ:OTLK) has administered the final dose to the last patient in its pivotal NORSE TWO safety and efficacy study that is designed to evaluate ONS-5010 (bevacizumab-vikg) for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD**).  
  
228 Patients are involved in the trial across 39 sites in the U.S. They are being treated for 12 months and topline data are expected in Q3 2021.  
  
The company anticipates the filing of a Biological License Application (BLA) in Q1 2022.    
  
**Outlook Therapeutics is entitled to 12 years of marketing exclusivity for ONS-5010,** as the first and only ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab approved by the FDA to treat wet AMD, according to the company.  
  
Outlook Therapeutics is trading 3.1% higher in the pre-market.  
  
The clinical program for ONS-5010 targeting a BLA in wet AMD consists of two additional trials, NORSE ONE and NORSE THREE.

16,ADTX," Hi everyone, I am holding since 0.91$ (No profit taking as of now) and I would like to share my view here based on my DD. The breast cancer drug is expected to be better than the current treatment with less side effects. Cash in hand with no debt, inclusion and possible BO or partnership. For those thinking that 30-40$ price range is not possible I would like to remind them that Gilead offered 20B for a buyout recently for Trodelvy and I can consider this as a peak. 5B market cap or even 10B buyout offer is totally reasonable as if I remember Trodelvy covers about 10% of breast cancer types where ATOS drug covers about 62% if I am not mistaken. I changed my sell order from 40$ to 80$ because FOMO should be considered.

Please note that this is not my first bio play as I have positions with Novavax, Gilead, ADTX and Relief Therapeutics and I like to play the potential/plus investing to something that can save a life!
