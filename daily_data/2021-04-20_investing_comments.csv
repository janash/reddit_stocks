Doing that allows them to do instant transfers, and 0 fee transactions. You're using the crypto Y as a hold of value to backup your share Z shares of P.

23,ATH," You bought in very close to ATH depending on the specific stocks/indices you took positions in. Statistically, there's going to be substantial downside risk when you buy a stock at a pumped valuation, even if it's a strong company in a bullish environment. When markets are this richly valued, markets want to *constantly* see data that supports the valuation, let alone continue elevating it. So, relatively small potatoes data can create some wobble - the 10-year yield shenanigans are a good example of this. A real yield of 1.7% won't match inflation this year, but it spooked tech. ATHs are expensive! Just is what it is - if your investing time horizon is longer-term than a few months, it shouldn't really matter in 2,5,10 years.

24,ST," Good on you for the Roth max-out. I don't know if you have a traditional IRA, but if you are low-income and have something there, you may also consider a back-door conversion. I did some Roth conversions in years when I had very low AGIs.

Personally, I have not made many investing decisions based on the capital gains status. Unless you are in a really high tax bracket, it's probably wisest to sell based on your personal goals and needs, and the current situation. LT vs ST Gains should be a consideration, but not a primary one. 

I like your mix and think you should just hold it anyway. The first three (Total Market, SP500, and Large-Cap) likely have similar portfolios at the top (think: FAANG), but if they're doing well for you, no need to bail yet.

35,BP," You might want to review how option contracts work.

you would owe $195,000 (to buy the 7500 shares of BP at $26 strike) if BP falls below $26/share on 5/21 and your puts were assigned. since you collected $14,850 when you wrote the puts, you would need to be able to sell those 7500 shares for $180,150 (or $24.02/share) to get back the $195,000.

your max loss is the scenario where your puts are exercised and BP goes bankrupt (stock goes to $0) minus the premium you collected for writing the puts, i.e., $26 strike x 7500 shares minus $14,850 in premium. not sure about the extra $1500; likely fees or outdated quotes when you entered the trade.

Edit, just took a look at BP - since the put is already in the money, there's also (low but non-zero) risk of early assignment that you'd want to factor in. Note that BP pays a sizable dividend, so risk of early assignment would be higher than non-dividend paying stocks and you'd want to keep ex dividend dates in mind when looking at the exprys.",makken,4,/r/investing/comments/mum8d7/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gv80jwk/,0.064,0.889,0.047,-0.6287

If growth is stagnant, then capital allocation and price to free cash flow becomes crucial, so I look at dividend and buyback history to see if it's a good buy. Typically with stagnant companies, I'd want price to FCF to be less than 10.

I also use spreadsheets to model projected market cap in 5 years with inputs for expected revenue growth (based on past growth), buybacks, projected multiples, and expected profit margins. I model a high, low, and neutral case, so I can have a margin of safety. Of course, it's impossible to be 100% accurate, but I like to think it gives me a ballpark framework.

Frankly, I think the amount of attention sports gambling has gotten in the recent past is absurd. It's like every local sports show is sponsored by one of the online gambling venues (or at least they do a long segment on sports gambling odds). Endless commercials on TV spouting loudly ""win easy money here!"". It's exhausting, and reeks of desperation to win over increasing tiny slices of what feels like a finite population of people who are sports gamblers.

53,NYC," Hello all,

My first time posting here. I'm 48 years old, live and work in NYC and own my own businesses - a very small business which also took a sizeable hit with covid last year. I've never invested in anything - don't have 401k, don't have ROTH and don't own a house. I'm the main bread winner for my extended family and I struggled for the most of my life to help them (still am) and never had a family member that was savvy enough to recommend how and why to invest. I hope these don't sound like excuses because they're not, I'm just embarrassed to join the game this late and wanted to give some explanation as to why. 

I have savings of about 80k and zero debt. 

Reading about retirement and investment, I realized that I'm very late to investing - in fact, I might be TOO late. Neither 401k or Roth IRA seems advisable for someone like me - still, if you feel I would benefit anyway please let me know. 

This has given me the idea of investing in the stock market at least. Not in an aggressive way but passively, maybe in the S&P 500 in general or some individual stocks like Amazon and Google etc. The cash I have at the very least could make some money instead of sitting in the bank. 

I have just started to read about this a little as well and learn as much as I can but having zero experience in the issue and nobody in my circle who does it, it seems very daunting. Any advice you have for me would be very appreciated - even if it's very basic because I'm still trying to learn the basics.",Vigolo216,2,/r/investing/comments/mum7tu/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gv8jvpn/,0.039,0.875,0.086,0.8973

24 years old, make about 55k combined with my partner

likely will rise to about 100k in the next year (intern)

bought a house with 20% down, 30k+ in savings. cars paid off, not a bad spot. i have saved almost everything i made in order to get to this point. enjoyed life still, took trips, and all that, just cut off the fat, no vices, eat out infrequently, nothing impulsive, etc. 

However, I do not like working to be frank, or at least, would like to feel secure enough to try and find a more fulfilling job. would like to be FI by 40 or so. Is that possible with two people and say 1m NW? can i get to 1m NW in that time frame by investing in mutual/index funds? i keep most of my savings cash because i am risk averse but it is becoming clear i need to get into the market in order to future proof my savings.

So I decided to finally get into investing after almost 2 years of lollygagging. I'm 19 turning 20 soon and want to start as early as possible. So far I'm just saving money (about 7k in savings due to unemployment from losing job at beginning of 2020), but now I want to invest money for the future. I have already brought everything I wanted, so 7k was whatever extra I had left. I make about $400 after taxes on unemployment a week.

Decided to finally take Graham Stephen advice and looked into S&P 500 and International Index Funds. For this, I am going for Vanguard. However, I am not sure if I should open a Roth IRA or General Savings. I already have emergency money, the 7k), have no debt from college due to college being free for me from my parent's union (although my plans to study abroad after graduating were canceled due to the pandemic), live with parents so no rent or bills to pay.

67,SNPR," It's a SPAC. And it's not really a penny stock - at least not yet. SPACs are highly volatile. The people that trade it tend to be speculators that are betting on what the shell company will acquire.  In taking a look at the price action and news, it's not necessarily a pump and dump. 

You may want to avoid buying stock that you don't understand or simply on the basis of what you read on social media. 

When you buy shares in a SPAC, you are effectively betting that you believe that the management of the SPAC will find a good company to buy. 

This particular SPAC announced a definitive agreement to buy Volta which is an EV charging business. EV stocks have declined recently from a lot of the hype from last few months so it's not surprising to see SNPR fall with it.

UBS has barely increased since this happened to CS which may make it a strong opportunity to capitalize if CS does take some long-term reputational damage from Greensill and Archegos. Further, they also have a sub-1 Price/Book, which makes it even more attractive. Maybe UBS as a hedge against CS?",0DayOTM,2,/r/investing/comments/muxxha/i_think_credit_suisse_cs_investors_are/gv8qb33/,0.13,0.687,0.183,0.7489
