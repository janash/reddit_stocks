0,IR," Interesting.  I've was telling drug reps at Shire *years* ago that there was a market for a pro-drug version of Ritalin.  

This is basically a 30:70 biphasic Focalin IR/Focalin prodrug.  This is actually a big deal.

Stimulant prodrugs, (of which Vyvanse is the one FDA approved currently and is an amphetamine and goes generic next year) are ideal because of their lowered abuse potential.  The IR component doesn't lend itself to this factor but I'm glad to see such a product has finally come to the market.  I use methylphenidates for ADHD obviously, but also chronic fatigue synd, shift work d/o, ""chemo brain"", idiopathic hypersomnia, narcolepsy, and treatment resistant depression.   

A lot of folks don't tolerate amphetamines- they can be too anxiogenic - and have to be switched to one of the methylphenidates.

Insurance companies will make coverage very difficult but if there's enough demand they'll start putting it on formularies in a year or two.

If coverage wasn't an issue- I'd prescribe this medication regularly.  ADHD is one of my bread and butter diagnostic codes.

This isn't just a tweak of Focalin like we've seen several times previously with Ritalin. 

A good analogy would be this is like Vyvanse with an integrated dose of Adderall IR to hasten onset of action- just with Focalin instead.  Very cool.  

Approve for ages 6 to adult.  

Lower peak concentration than Focalin XR, but wears off more slowly- hence less of a crash.  

I've been through this with other new approvals before.  It takes several months before enough is made to get to market. Then the drug reps go do their things. Then the insurance companies play dumb and don't know what you're talking about.  6-8 months for Rxs to be written depending on how well they have their shit together.  Then maybe maybe get approval for night shift disorder and extend the patent, then sell rights to a big pharma company.  

You got in on this at 0.19.  Good job.  If this is all that it looks to be, it'd be a top 15 drug i prescribe.  Very cool.",Habanos_Smoker,240,/r/investing/comments/lwmd6t/kmph_got_fda_approval_tonight/gpidfts/,0.092,0.791,0.117,0.813

7,IR," I'm somewhat confused with your statements. Many ""XR/ER"" formulations of methylphenidate/dexmethylphenidate have a mix of IR + ER drug. For example, from Focalin XR pharmacokinetics: 

Focalin XR is an extended-release formulation of dexmethylphenidate with a bi-modal release profile. Each bead-filled Focalin XR capsule contains half the dose as immediate-release beads and half as enteric-coated, delayed-release beads, thus providing an immediate release of dexmethylphenidate and a delayed release of dexmethylphenidate. 

How is this different? Other than the ratios of IR:ER, perhaps. However, different formulations of methylphenidate for example also have differing ratios of IR:ER.",neuroprncss,1,/r/investing/comments/lwmd6t/kmph_got_fda_approval_tonight/gpk4971/,0.043,0.957,0.0,-0.4417

12,IR," >Well- all XR simulants are biphasic (and now there's one that's triphasic).  Which means there's two phases.  An immediate release phase and extended release phase.  Take Adderall XR 30 mg.  Adderall XR is 50:50 biphasic.  Which means 50% is instant release and the other 50% is extended release.  Concerta- which is just methylphenidate- is also 50:50 biphasic.  Metadate which is also just methylphenidate, is 30:70 biphasic.    
>  
>Then there's Mydayis which is essentially triphasic.  But Azstarys has a Focalin IR combined with a Focalin-prodrug.  The prodrug isn't ""extended release"" in the conventional sense.  Your liver metabolizes it- ie breaks it down- and when it ""breaks it down"" it gets activated.  This method of getting a drug into the body means it doesn't really work when someone snorts/smokes/injects etc.  However, the IR component can still obviously be abused that way.  Contrast that to Vyvanse which contains only a prodrug.  Can it still be abused?  Yes, people take more than directed.  But there's still a harm reduction effort there.  Pre-Vyvanse, my ADHD med ration was approximately 80% Adderall (of one formulation or the other) and 20% all others (the majority of which was some formulation of methylphenidate.  Post-Vyvanse, my ration changed to about 50% Vyvanse, 30% Adderall, and my methylphenidate rx's were relatively unaffected.

>So yes, I see this changing my prescribing habits?  Vyvanse too strong?  Let's change to Azstarys instead. Or start a patient on Azstarys.  At the end of the day, it's not a new class of medication.

Transfer what I have for a fee to Schwab 2. Sell everything on Robinhood and just move my cash back to back then to Schwab 3. Keep RH, and just don’t add anymore money to it?

84,LOW," Edit:  I'm not looking for advice, just a question about weird market stuff.  I hope I'm in the right place to ask this...

Ok so I'm pretty new to investing in general, and I've noticed something interesting.

If you look at RKT's after hours ticker (I know, I know...  memestonks...  I'm watching it for fun), at 4:50pm last night the price fell from 39 to 23. Again at 5:40, the price went from 40 to 17.  For both occurrences, the price IMMEDIATELY jumped back up to where it was.

Why would this happen?  If I had a GTC limit order for lets say 100@18, would it have filled? That would mean everyone should have a bunch of GTC limit orders for stupid low prices, and hope for a drop like this.  If that would have worked, I could have doubled my investment over night.

Tl;dr: why would a stock 'randomly' drop 50% for only a moment after hours, only to instantly go back up to where it was?  Can a person capitalize on events like that by placing GTC limit orders for a LOW price hoping for a massive after hours dip like this?",TheRealScarr,1,/r/investing/comments/lwqb2x/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gpj86qh/,0.069,0.807,0.124,0.9043
85,IMO," Still **BULLISH** on **OTGLY** (Cd Projekt Red)  


\----- Disclaimer: I am **long OTGLY 270** **shs**. -----

I think that CB2077 recent news have created a mini perfect storm: Bad launch + Class Action Lawsuit + Cyber attack

But still over 13 million copies sold. I think that the merits of the game and the merits of the company can help the company survive all of this. Not a given, though.

Sometimes, shares RISE after a lawsuit is settled. So, depending on when and what the outcome is, the stock can recover once the lawsuit is behind it. Here's an example: [https://www.reuters.com/article/sppage012-n28397927-oisbn/discover-shares-rise-after-lawsuit-settlement-idUSN2839792720081029](https://www.reuters.com/article/sppage012-n28397927-oisbn/discover-shares-rise-after-lawsuit-settlement-idUSN2839792720081029)

The cyber attack apparently prevented a number of the game's bug fixes, allegedly (probably a convenient excuse, but they could be telling the truth).

It's become a **longish-term** play at this point IMO. Class action lawsuits can range from taking a few months or a few years -\_-",MatheiuDubois,1,/r/investing/comments/lwqb2x/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gpjc6bj/,0.085,0.798,0.117,0.431

Will clarify my concern about MRK being left behind because they (along with JNJ) weren't didn't participate with CRISPR technology development for the covid vaccine. CRISPR is a whole branch of tech that was locked away by conservative government law/regulations/tape, but was unleashed because of the pandemic. MRK works on CRISPR too, but this vaccine means they are lagging the Moderna & Pfizer in this area. Not a huge problem by itself, but it is something I'd consider especially if CRISPR tech can be adapted to solutions of other problems that are part of MRK's market.",zxc123zxc123,1,/r/investing/comments/lwqiiq/merck_will_reportedly_help_produce_johnson/gpkn9zc/,0.062,0.817,0.121,0.567

I have about $10k which is set aside (from year end bonus) to be used as needed on home improvements and baby expenses (due in July!) over the next 3-12 months. I expect to draw down from this account in chunks as I incur these expenses.

What is the best place to park this money for the short to mid term? Was thinking just all in SPY and cash out as needed?

Goals would be to achieve some growth, don't mind losing some of it to normal stock market risks. If I lose 25%, I will end up just taking the money from elsewhere if needed.  I could also have some other funds going into this account as well, so kind of hope to keep it as a revolving growth investment facility. Is that a good idea? Tax implications which I am missing?

163,GME,"  

Curious how people invest on regularly scheduled intervals on platforms like Fidelity.

Background,  I jumped on M1 about a year ago. I liked the ideas of pies and being  able to create pies within pies and weighting them however you liked. I  also really liked the auto fund feature where I can have a transfer  scheduled every week that then gets distributed into all my slices based  on percentage.

A couple weeks  ago, I opened a Fidelity account to get access to more ETFs that weren't  available on M1, and to have a more traditional brokerage account. I  set up a monthly transfer of $100, after an initial deposit of $5k  (which I used to buy an initial set of ETFs), and today was the first  auto deposit. Just curious how people typically invest these auto  deposits.

Once I have my portfolio  set up the way I intend to keep it for the long term, I'd love if I  could set up an auto-invest. But I also don't love the idea of partial  shares after some of the stuff that went down with GME. Granted that was  a unique situation, but I'd like to have ultimate freedom and if I'm  constantly buying partial shares, that may be hampered.

I think something similar is happening for COST; and I consider that as a buying opportunity.  If people are selling due to something that won't negatively impact earnings, then you're getting a better P/E ratio.

Any person can set up shop, accept crypto payment, and hand over the equivalent local currency.

But most of their profits come from people sending money to their families at cross border transaction places (think US-Mexico border) and they wouldn't have access to crypto.

“As a result of the Trent 1000 and as announced in November, we are recognizing a net exceptional charge of £1,361m within our financials, contributing to a reported loss of £852m,’’ he said.

“We have fixes designed for all but one of the issues identified and are well advanced on certification and rolling them out into the fleet.

“As the year drew to a close, we carried out a detailed technical re-evaluation of our progress on the final fix, a new high-pressure turbine blade for the Trent 1000 TEN.

“Based upon that work and test activity, we reset our financial and operational expectations for the engine in November, based on a revised estimate of final blade durability, in order to provide certainty for customers and greater clarity for investors.

“Since then, we have made good progress on the design of this blade and continue to expect certification of this component in the first half of 2021.”",frickshrek,1,/r/investing/comments/lx0g6r/rycey_long_hold_rollsroyce/gpkwe72/,0.026,0.848,0.125,0.9694

225,MTG," A pain with these is the buying and selling. They're a lot less liquid than something like equities. It can be very difficult to get in and out at good prices. And you really have to worry about people ripping you off through counterfeits or even scams when it comes time to sell.

It's hard to scale investing in these as well. (I.e. selling a couple dual lands is one thing, but finding good buyers for a couple hundred different singles is a full time job if you want to sell at good prices)

Also, you have to store the physical asset in proper conditions, so they don't degrade over time. (I.e. make sure you know how to properly store wine for example - not quite as simple as just leaving the bottle on a random shelf).

In terms of saying they all beat the market - that's often not true.

Overall, just a lot more work and risk involved. So you really want much higher returns than you would from other assets to offset that.

I'd recommend sticking with things you know really well. If you know MTG, awesome, buy duals if you want. If you don't know wine tho, I wouldn't invest in it.",BroTripp,1,/r/investing/comments/lwmrhv/investing_in_nonregistered_assets/gpiv5p7/,0.068,0.755,0.176,0.9745
