Fundamentals and ratio analysis to assess the intrinsic value of a stock to see if its overvalued, undervalued or fair valued, then technical analysis to assess my entry and exit points. 

It’s more important to know when to sell then when to buy, because it’s all just “equity” until you cash out, that’s when you make the $$$. Technical analysis helps with this. 

Albeit technical analysis using price action is better for scalping, day trading, swing trading, position trading etc. 

Success rate: 52% 

Hedge funds managers are at 60 - 65% and that’s really really good. It’s about making more on the wins that help offset the losses and still being ‘green’ and the end of the day/month/year.

Don’t believe in the 80%  stock picking stock guru hype it’s all just marketing.

The foundation of investing and trading isn’t even profits anyways, it’s Risk Management. 

You need to learn to keep it, before you can grow it. 

Also make sure to learn about ‘second-order’ thinking and build a habit of thinking in probabilities. 

Lastly, understand and master the inter-related concept of how equities, bond prices, commodities and currencies influence the market and economy as a whole which more importantly, affects your investments.

Your interests, what you do for work, etc. are likely a much bigger edge in picking stocks that the market has undervalued than following along a bunch of market astrologers who think they have an edge on Randomness.

TA is a great deal of correlating things to one another that ought not necessarily be correlated (if you follow the famous ‘support/resistance’ theory, your returns will correlate more poorly to the movements of the S&P500 than if you’d followed the supply of butter churned in Bangladesh— and that is not a joke).

And if we extend the definition of ‘patterns’ from more than just the silly things they name on charts to say, any sort of regularly recurring event, then TA is chalk full of attempting to divine patterns and predict the future movements of a stock based on present ‘indicators’. 

Before you go down the dubious path of TA, I do really suggest Lynch’s book or Burton Malkiel’s A Random Walk Down Wallstreet (he does a lovely brief history on market bubbles too). 

Any fool can day trade cup and saucers in a bull market for a few years and call himself a genius, but I’d wager I could shake a game of boggle, pick stocks based on the ticker names I can come up with, and have done about as well if I’d just forgotten about the portfolio for the same amount of time. 

For all their random ‘genius’ events of winning, there many not so genius random, unforeseen events that have led them to losses (and they will proudly tell you how they followed this strategy or that to minimize their losses).

I’ve seen plenty of daytraders and swing traders bragging about gains playing stocks that, had they held them longer, ended up truly mooning on their own merits. Again, there’s a reason TA is shunned by academics, by most security analysts (who are all very bright people). Most of it is mathematical nonsense. It uses numbers and calculations, sure, but makes a lot of statistical nonsense when it comes to implying true correlations. And when a seemingly successful strategy *does* come along, the minute it gets known by the others, it will fail (if We all know a stock is going up today, it is going to go up today.

I am proposing a way to show TA working on a weekly/monthly chart by forecasting a move no one expects. Almost never happens. I'm not even talking about fundies, but they will change if this chart pattern forms.

In this case would you also say that TA can not be used to forecast moves that only happen once a decade? You'd have to. Because otherwise TA would forecast the swings in-between and someone would have an obvious advantage. 

So I think we've found a null hypothesis for this, right? If TA can forecast major (Unusual) market swings, you're probably wrong. It probably is useful over that time span?

As to using monthly/weekly charts I would say you could build a case for TA but the objective would be demonstrating you can call a pattern correctly and that can be suitably repeated such that you've matched or beaten the market in a given year.

I made money in the down market.  And it was really easy. What was far harder was 2019 where I anticipated a down market too early. 

I would put to you that the trading conditions of 2010 to 2018 implied the markets would become more volatile (Using TA strats). Since that time there have been ways to see where big swings in the market may come. Do well on both sides of the market quite a lot of the time. 

Have had a very significant edge and lower risk than people who have bought blindly (And been rewarded greatly for that, which is a warning - tbh). 

To show this to be true (Or not) I'll use the same analysis methods on swings going forward and post my forecasts (Many of them already posted). 

To get in and out of markets when they are volatile, I am using recurring principles I've found from studying market corrections.

89,DD," Depends what you want to trade, penny stocks or major stock...But my general advice is:

Paper trade for a week or two. 

Lot of brokers have paper trading (trading using fake money). So you can just test all the functions, what does what, you can see how stocks behave. 

When you comfortable with stock market and your broker, you start finding a stock you like. Do DD (due diligence) and get small position. Do not know your budget but be prepared to lose it all (you need to have that mentality otherwise you will get depressed).

Do not get attached to any stock, its not your girlfriend, you will never spend life together, its a short term thing. You need to be calculated and ruthless, its either you fuck the stock or the stock fucks you.

91,TSLA," Open up your app then hit research learn a few things. Try to locate a stock you might like to buy. Look at its high and its low for 52 weeks then check for a dividend. Set your buy with a limit at the price that you desire to purchase the stock at. Buy as low as you can and set a sell at a higher price than what you bought at. 

For Example O is a dividend aristocrat it stays in a nice range and pays a dividend consecutively. TSLA is a growth stock it goes up and down and is volatile with no dividend but you are banking on its future. A spec stock is pure speculation and high risk meaning a bad move money gone. Penny stocks fall into this category as do some growth stocks.
Another method is to dollar cost average into a stock by buying with the same amount of $ every month or week. This catches ups and down to average in.

93,DD," My advice, would be to scour the internet for days and days to find a list of companies and spread and diversify your investments into each one. Now, dont throw all the money in at once, instead break up your money into thirds. Or even half. If you choose to add more to a position later, do so. If you have to cut losses, do so. But choose high risk, high reward companies. But hedge everything by spreading out your investment, and allowing your own due diligence to eliminate the risk. High risk high reward plays are just that, but some companies that can be deemed that, will still run you 10x plays that you can exit. Or better, some companies deemed high risk are destined to go to the top based on what they bring to the table. That's what you need to develop an eye for. Keep your ear to rhe ground and search for information. Not the ticker, not the sentiment. Dig into the company. Paper trade, learn terms, develop a strategy, diversify, and dont jump in all at once. It can be hard for penny stocks, as commision fees will make you want to just do it all at once. But there will be dips. Buy those dips. Average in a bit better with your second purchase, or if you see the rocket taking off, throw the rest on there for sure profit. The company Im currently looking at is $CLIS. Dipped hard the other day. Its something I have done my DD on, and something I believe in. I bought more.

94,PDT," I think the PDT is more of a restriction on margin accounts, not cash accounts.

95,PDT," You're not completely wrong. 

I believe it has to do with the cash settling after selling a stock. If you sell, the money from the sell needs to settle (typically 2 trading days) before you can buy again *using that money*. Most brokers will give you the *good faith violation* warning if you try to trade on that money before its settled from the previous trade, and a violation if you proceed. Too many violations and you're labeled a PDT and they may restrict trading in your account for 30 or 60 days (?

They study ways to use the immune system to fight certain cancers.

They may have good news coming out soon, but I’m not an expert.  these are just the facts I can give you.

They also just had a PO, which lowered the stock price, that ended 3 days ago.  Weird they’d buy in right after, huh?  I just realized that as I was posting this.  Dunno if it means anything.

Yeah “off the wall” is pretty accurate if we add caps and underline.

The nature of good, compatible treatments is that they are autologous- originating from the same source. Coming from outside the body is already a flag of some fiction added to that science. Some context is the new mRNA vaccine based treatment of modern a that allowed for speedy production AND testing was that it stripped the genetic information down to a way for the body’s immune system to accept it easier. If this is that than it makes sense but haven’t looked at the research in detail

That’s the science take

The psych take:

We’re in a VERY weird point in history and what we know is from all of financial history is that bubbles breed face value companies. In the list of patents (remember I skimmed and I’m just some fuck hole on the internet) like 2/3 were COVID based and that’s a trigger word in bio tech rn for obvious reasons.

Flag one

Additionally their other treatments are all over the place! PTSD to COVID to cancer??? Tf. If I go to a restaurant I was them to specialize in one cuisine- not 3 totally different ones and also be able to change the oil on my car

167,HOFV," I think it’s true. Canadian exchanges always halt pennystocks before they release good news. $IPNNF was halted for a full day today (they are also listed on a Canadian exchange). $IPNFF is a Canadian NFT/AR stock, with existing partnerships with the NFL. Coincidence with the HOFV news ? 🤷‍♂️ I think not. 

Also why would you expect $IPNFF to open down? They got halted by the exchange for pending news (IRROC which is the Canadian sec only does that for big big news that they think will make the stock move fast) 🤣. This is a NFT stock with partnerships with the NFL + the HOFV hype.",stocklizarddude,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/m8yk47/national_football_tokens/grk2y2v/,0.0,0.941,0.059,0.7236

They have an institutional investor (unheard of in the OTC, not even ALPP had one prior to its run), and a line of credit from a Nasdaq backing capital firm. They are OTCQB and have plans to uplist. Their financials are amazing with significant growth.

Could something happen? Maybe, but I don't trust it. Even if the news is good, is it not baked in at +500%?  There are still people trapped in at up to 1000% as well who are going to want to offload for any penny they can get.

Maybe you all get lucky, but the thing needs today's volume to hold out over the stuck panic sellers.
