39,SPCE," We'll see whos right since both the markets and public seemed divided on this but I'm bearish on SPCE this week.

CPI is coming out, this market's gonna pull back when it misses again and inflation isn't temporary. FOMC looms right around the corner as well - inflation is temporary in their words as they know supply chains are clogged to the tits and things are continuously getting more expensive in our ""recovery""... Fears of another COVID variant (probably not gonna matter too much), slowing down in summer months... A lot of catalysts are there for a modest correction to recent run-ups, at the very least. I do think we're in a bubble but timing the crash is... Lol, and I don't see hard catalysts for it.

They've delays, and successful flights before. If you watch the live footage, while every media right now seems to try selling how ""monumental"" it is, look at it from a business perspective - how soon are they taking other billionaires up there? What is the price of this experience? What are the profits they will take? Can they grow in the space area beyond this?

I watch this Unity craft taking people in this flight, strapped up like they're in a military aircraft or something. They can look out the window and see space, sure. But what profound experience are they getting beyond that, anything we don't really know? I don't think this is all that revolutionary as themes of ""space"" are generally concerned. I believe SPCE will have to do more much more than this to keep their current market cap, and potential market share in the future.

Again, we'll see if bulls or bears print. But if I had to bet, this is a ""sell the news"" sequence bound to happen based on market conditions for the upcoming week.",Inori92,61,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oi822m/historic_moment_for_spac_first_flight_by_virgin/h4u2jmr/,0.041,0.871,0.089,0.9469

73,HE, Spce is incredibly overvalued and from the looks of the graph it's about to crash again you can see the the bearish pattern. You didn't research the potential for this good news to drop the stock to 15. Instead of doing simple research you could've determined that your investment has a 40/60 shot of being successful. Plus you did an  options contract which means you could lose your entire investment or go so negative you couldn't possibly pull out. You could have bought a couple shares and that investment would have way safer then buying towards the top with options contracts. Hopefully you saw the risk and bought the premium for 2 years so you will sertainly make incredible gains. once we start using ai (true born ai)to make breakthrus in space flight you could could collet millions of dollars in this one stock but instead of using you brain you probably lost 12 grand and gave into greed.

92,ALL," I have to say, I was surprised to see Elon Musk this morning. I thought it was super cool of him, and shows he cares about space travel a lot, about being a part of the historical part of this.
  
I watch a lot of YT, and the podcasters I listen to have ALL said something along the lines of ""this is the new 'buying a plane' for rich people... it's a rare experience"" so I could very easily see this becoming a tourist thing for wealthier people once the safety record is more established. Wealth disparity is super high right now of course, so that might help these flights gain more traction.
  
This may sound stupid, but I bought 5 shares on Friday just as goodwill to Branson. I didn't and don't expect to see the money back, I just love the idea of aggressive innovation and space/technology. I think it's tremendously courageous of him to do what he did today, he's 70 years old!

You keep pushing AMC but if someone had invested money at any point in the last month they would have lost money.  The real question is why is AMC’s price declining?  A huge factor in CLOV’s decline is the share lockup expiration.  Google what happens to the price of a share around this event (as the behavior is common to literally every company that has had this event).  The price declines in the weeks in anticipation and drops when it happens.

234,CVS," I'm not sure about this. I cannot speak on the economic mechanics, my knowledge is mostly in healthcare, specifically pharmacy.  

Walgreens has not shown themselves to be as aggressive as they need to be in retail pharmacy. CVS pretty much runs that front, from both having caremark insurance to scooping up LTCs (long term care pharmacy -  nursing homes, hospice, etc) and mom and pops, CVS Health runs the joint. 

I would hold caution, as any spikes you see right now are due to covid. You'd have a better bet of investing in pharmaceutical companies, rather than retail pharmacies. If you do invest in retail giants, make sure they have something down the pipine, and are not just resting in their name. 



Random FYI - Please support your local independent pharmacies! Mom and Pop pharmacies have been suffering over the years, and most can't compete with conglomerates. You will receive better care and personalized attention. 8 of 10 independent pharmacies that I visit have their shit down to a motherfucking science. They tend to make less mistakes because they are not as busy and not held to corporate bullshit. They will work hard to find ways to help with copays and medication adherence. Most retail workers are dried, souless husks. Independents care when they make a mistake, most corps don't even bat an eyelash when I tell them they told a patient to take 3x more muscle relaxant than prescribed (well I saw him last week, he's fine.

They dont seem to care if it's under $950 or not...  nor that thiefs have weapons or not.  Its hands off by security & employees, no interference except verbal,  organized crime.

309,API," Hey guys,

It's u/nobjos back again with another analysis. I post a similar analysis every week.

In case you missed out on last weeks analysis, you can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/odjp8j/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/)

Some FAQ’s:

**How does the program work:** The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).

**Can I use the code/is it open source:** Yes.

**What is sentiment:** It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.

**If I had a dollar for every time someone built these jokes:** Consider it as a market recap. Plus more the number of programs, the more you know someone is not bullshitting you with the list as you can just as easily cross-verify.

336,TV," I disagree. I think that Sunday ticket has been limited because it was only available to direct tv subscribers. You had to either change tv providers (to the most expensive option) or start (if you’re like me and don’t pay for tv). There’s a lot of people out there that would have paid $14/mo to be able to buy Sunday ticket. There was one year where you could buy it over PlayStation network and those sales were incredible because not everyone wants to get direct tv, but a lot of people want Sunday ticket. 

The Apple to Apple argument is stupid because I can get it on my Samsung tv. There’s no need to have an iPhone to get apply tv. My in laws, the least tech savvy people, have Apple TV because they needed to watch Ted Lasso (an absolute banger of a show btw).
