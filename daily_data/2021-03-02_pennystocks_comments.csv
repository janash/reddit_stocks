Its mainly looking for word of the week or month. Couple weeks ago it was crypto. 

So all I do is look through reddit, yahoo and whatever for some crypto stock that I think will get swept up in the hype. 

Ride the wave. Sell when I want.

Move on to the next wave. 

The key thing is that the companies need to look promising. I'm not picking random stocks. 

I bought EBON and sold for 80% profit because of:

1. The crypto wave
2. They make some great mining gear specializing in simultaneous coin mining 
3. They have an exchange coming out in the spring. 

All those 3 together, to me, meant itll ride the wave.

I use one and shop at the other so I’m HODL all the way now but that’s not what I’d like to see with this go-around. But there have been others that continued to go up-up-up.

Based on my research, everything stated above in regards to the future of the company, are all mostly claims and forward-looking statements by potential parties, and not guarantees. 

• Ryan stated he filed with OTC to become current; but not current yet (an email with fees paid isn't confirmation).

• No financial statements for several years (since 2014 if I'm correct). Ryan mentioned LTNC brought in about $6M last year. However, a tweet isn't a confirmation of earnings/revenue. 

• Alex Guerrero's tweet on 2/21 as follows: ""$LTNC Looking forward to Monday and a bright future ahead""
This is just a statment, not facts. No contract signed claiming he's on board with $LTNC. Additionally, his tweet implies there would be some news/info the following Monday, but nothing as of yet confirming his partnership. 

• New CEO followed Brady and Gronk on Twitter. Well, I follow Elon Musk on Twitter- does this imply I'll be partnering with Tesla or SpaceX? 
Now if Brady or Gronk followed the new CEO, I'd prob smile. But still wouldn't consider that a catalyst.

The beverage industry has some MAJOR players. We're talking Pepsi/Coca-Cola. Yes, LTNC could be acquired by one of these in the future, but without a contract, financials, revenue, being current and partnerships/endorsements with major athletes, I personally don't believe LTNC is a company with a potential market cap of $7-$70B (based on majority of the shareholders claiming this can go to $1-10 within a year or two)

By “real information” I mean it’s public, and is generally confirmed to be true. 

In regards to Ryan filing with the OTC, if fees are paid, shows confirmation of email.. thats definitely better than most company’s. 
 
Yes no earnings is skeptical, but the business is no longer working on labour and they changing direction. It’s a .03 cent stock, how much information do you seriously need to take the risk? OTC - high risk high reward. 

I agree, maybe we don’t have any information on any contract, etc but with every deal/contract comes and NDA. they can only release a certain amount of info. From my knowledge, Alex Guerrero’s tweet is pinned on his profile.  He was also in a video call couple weeks ago with Ryan when the news was building up. 

Ryan is no longer the CEO, so we just have to wait until we hear a REAL statement from the new ceo/president. 

I didn’t expect 5-10 different OTC stocks to hit over $1 the past few months but hey.. anything can seriously happen. 

With the information being shared, and the information coming out about the new company that acquired LTNC, for me, it’s worth the risk to find out in a year or two after information is released, that they are going to be bought out by a bigger company.  

Yes the new shares being issued may be a problem down the road, but I’d like to assume it’s for the new company share holders.  Only the future will tell. 

Maybe the new CEO is just following Brady & Gronk out of personal entertainment - but he did confirm in a tw. that this new account is STRICTLY Buisness, so why would he follow people for personal gain if he still has his personal account active? Just pieces to put together.

LASTLY, let me just add Ryan is up over 25 million dollars. Pictures to prove, he hasn’t sold a thing. If he was taking his exit; like everyone’s trying to bash, and leaving for himself, don’t you think he would of cashed out?

Clinical Studies Phase 3 of CPI-006 as COVID treatment consists of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study expected to enroll \~1,000 patients across global sites with results expected in Q4 2021 (same link as above).

The financials (Here I will be more brief because I am a scientist and not an economist)

\-CORVUS pharmaceuticals has a total revenue of 140 M, they are literally burning cash at a rate of 40 M per year. The company had no earning the last three years, thus they are investing all their money in their RD projects.

\-The short rate is \~7%, not the lowest but not the highest.

\-The CEO just increased his position in the company by 8.5%

\- They just had a DO of 32M$ at a share price of 3.5$.

\-The average volume is 690 K and the actual volume is 2.5M.

\- The share is standing in its support level of \~4$.

My opinion

Based on the huge increase in volume together with the share being at a support level of 4$, the share may show some upward volatility, however, there is no inminent catalyst in a short-term that will support/explain such an increase.

\-The short rate is \~7%, not the lowest but not the highest.

\-The CEO just increased his position in the company by 8.5%

\- They just had a DO of 32M$ at a share price of 3.5$.

\-The average volume is 690 K and the actual volume is 2.5M.

\- The share is standing in its support level of \~4$.

My opinion

Based on the huge increase in volume together with the share being at a support level of 4$, the share may show some upward volatility, however, there is no inminent catalyst in a short-term that will support/explain such an increase.

**My take is to wait and see how the market evolves and take position in CORVUS as we approach Q4.

232,CEO," Glad to see others see value in the stock.  I remember a member on another site finding a elusive article quoting Wandi revenue off its presold prices to be 100 million per year.  I should have kept that link, but didn't.  

If you look at the DA signed with Wandi the writing on the contract is very specific in mentioning it seems to be a RM deal.  That would make sense since 60 million of 120 million of the stock would be owned by Wandi owner which likely would make him majority shareholder.  I'm assuming that is how it is going to still played out?  That would allow Wandi to go public, get even bigger, and then likely want to uplist in the future.

The deal has taken FOREVER for but is definitely on.  Here is why:  1.  It was a DA that was registered with the SEC and not a LOI.  That means any backing out would be ""material"" and have to disclosed with a 6k/ 8k, 2. 1/2 of the shares were already given to Wandi which that owner still holds and has not returned (likely sitting in escrow) all confirmed on last 10q, and 3.  In Dec. there is documentation from Cyprus that 2 new directors were appointed to Wandi.  Those directors are a law firm in Cyprus who does work with SGCI in Europe whose principle/ founder happens to be DS Chang the current CEO of Resort.  How about that for some internet sleuthing??

My only warning to folks is this an investment you don't check everyday and just wait out 2021 knowing it will likely reward you at some point.

They should have 100 live now (weather allowing reopening) so that means >100 MILLION GROSS profit (>200 million revenue) for the year if they don't expand beyond this.

Flurotech

TSX: $TEST | OTCQB: $FLURF

They're developing a revolutionary Pandemic Defense and Economic Recovery System. Their tech can rapidly test for COVID19 using saliva at entry ways of stadiums, airports, offices, etc. It is the first testing system that will be Antigen-based with a throughput capacity of 2,500+ tests per hour. They've got a great board with connections to the FDA, which will help with fast tracking authorization. This will be huge in the long run!

276,DD," I'm an intermediate level trader and I do my investing through robinhood. I know there are tons of better brokers out there, but I really like the no-fee at all model from robinhood. I just put all of my gambling money into positions I plan to hold for at least a few weeks to months and I think now is a good time to migrate to another platform since it will probably take that long to get the transfer done. So I was looking for broker suggestions based on my needs. I've listed some wants and not wants below, thank you so much for any advice you can give me.

&#x200B;

1. I would like to be no-fee ideally or very very low fee. If it does have a fee I'd like that to be a per-transaction fee and not recurring.
2. Being able to trade in OTC's and foreign markets would be nice, even if it costs more to trade (I'm in the US, but Canada would be good to have access to).
3. Quick deposit turnaround time and hopefully being extended credit after initiating a deposit after I've been with the trading platform for a period of time.
4. A phone app that's secure and easy to navigate.
5. The ability to trade crypto would be nice, but not a dealbreaker.

What I don't need are:

1. A decent ticker interface, I do all my DD with outside sources. For some reason, I can't bring myself to trust the tickers and graphs of a broker.
2. Fancy research or suggestions on what stock to buy. Again, same reason as 1. I feel like these are often motivated by the broker's interests and not mine.",jarofsalamanders,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/lvtrk8/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gpfegyz/,0.02,0.778,0.202,0.9956

TXMD - It's been pumped and dumped and returned to prepump levels (wrote this at $1.50) that are consistent with 3 months and a year ago. Their birth control product ANNOVERA™ was released about 9 months ago and Q3 of 2020 they saw a 50% increase in the EPS and that's with a huge increase in spending to get the thing marketed. Their Q4 2020 earnings is coming out March 2nd. If it sees another huge increase then the stock will hit at least $2 in my opinion. Now for the smooth brained part, institutions have been loading up on this stock for months and are currently sitting at about 60% ownership and DIDNT sell during the recent pump and dump. This to me is a great sign because they know once the birth control starts gaining momentum the stock will likely at least double in value. Lastly, I decided to look into the online hype surrounding not TXMD but their product (crazy ik) by looking at the birth control subreddit and despite many people saying they experience horrid side affects, for every one of them there is 3 in the comments that had moderate-no side effects. This tells me that for every one person that didn't like it at least 10 did but those who feel strongly negative towards it are much more likely to respond due to voluntary response bias. In addition since the birth control was introduced 9 months ago discussion about people getting it on the on the subreddit has been exponentially growing (even despite most of the questions having already been answered in previous posts). The product can be prescribed online, delivered via mail, administered by the user, lasts for a year, and doesn't cause discomfort or pain during sex. All of these are advantages over it's competitor Nuvaring. And it met a need for a generation of women who started having sex when they weren't necessarily allowed to go to the doctor for a prescription bc of restrictions or the doctors are backlogged by the influx of patients that have been waiting. Also it's $2000 a pop (covered by most insurance) so the company has 50 mill gross revenue rn, while 1.5 million people worldwide use the Nuvoring which is losing market share faster than than a redneck loses his teeth. 

Limitations: It has not been studied in obese women who account for 40-50% of women in their childbearing years. Body fat changes the way that birth control interacts with the body, this likely means that if they were to put enough hormones in it for it be effective in an obese sample, it could cause negative more side effects in the non-obese sample. I can see them overcoming this by creating new product or dosage with the levels of hormones necessary for obese women while still being protected by their patents.

369,NAT," my read on it is it's going down because CBL focuses on mall and retail spaces. Amazon and Covid are a double whammy, and if CBL wants to restructure it first has to liquidate the hundreds of millions it has in mortgage securities... at a loss. 

CBL and several other REITs are seeing negative sentiment sort of like a lot of dry bulk shipping companies like NAT and TOPS. People want to invest in the future, not a dying industry. If the company manages to restructure successfully into something more future proof, great, but it's gonna take a *long* time either way.",Plagrea,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/lvs49a/cblaq_whats_the_deal_here/gpe48ir/,0.038,0.838,0.124,0.7189
