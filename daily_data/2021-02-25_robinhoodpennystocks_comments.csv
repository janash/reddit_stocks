Tbh I feel like this sub is full of people who started trading in mid January when all the pennys just kept going up.  Day trading and short term plays are easy profits during major bull runs but for the most part in general your gonna need consistent DD (not just once when you buy a position) and patience to hold long term (months to years).  Most of the moons I’ve experienced happened months after I first bought in after experiencing mostly sideways and downward movement.

328,CLSN," It’s the season for money making again. I can not help myself but to continue to share the wealth with my fellow degenerates again. But this time , it will be bigger than the last money making ticker I showered you guys with which is CLSN. Here is a new ticker that I want you guys to cash in on soon. 

Company: Corvus Pharmaceuticals 

Analysis

1) Insider bought millions of shares about 1 week ago for 3.5$ a share which presents as support.

2) hedge funds also bought around 3.5-4$ a share which indicates a strong move to the upside soon. We all know these funds love to triple their money so get in early with them.

3) the float of this stock is still low.

4) Price is still under 4$ which presents a buying opportunity couple with low risk.

5) My PT for this company is 20$ but multiple analysts reported high 15$ , median 9$, low 4$.

6) The management team used to own Pharmacyclic which sold for 261$ dollar a share. The management has experience to turn a profit for investors.

7) The company has a long pipeline in works, we should expect news very soon. 

Conclusion

Get in early while it’s still cheap because it will absolutely rocket 100-200% when they release news which I think should be very soon. PT 20$",zekedude,-7,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lrso2s/daily_discussion_thread/goqpsxn/,0.049,0.785,0.166,0.9847

Analysis

1) Insider bought millions of shares about 1 week ago for 3.5$ a share which presents as support.

2) hedge funds also bought around 3.5-4$ a share which indicates a strong move to the upside soon. We all know these funds love to triple their money so get in early with them.

3) the float of this stock is still low.

4) Price is still under 4$ which presents a buying opportunity couple with low risk.

5) My PT for this company is 20$ but multiple analysts reported high 15$ , median 9$, low 4$.

6) The management team used to own Pharmacyclic which sold for 261$ dollar a share. The management has experience to turn a profit for investors.

7) The company has a long pipeline in works, we should expect news very soon. 

Conclusion

Get in early while it’s still cheap because it will absolutely rocket 100-200% when they release news which I think should be very soon. PT 20$",zekedude,-7,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lrso2s/daily_discussion_thread/goqpsxn/,0.049,0.785,0.166,0.9847

341,ASRT," I am using ASRT for covered stock options play.

Buy 100 shares, sell a covered call.

Share cost - $91, call premium 3/19 $1 strike $25.  

Math is you sell for $100 if above $1 on 3/19, $125 total gross on $91 for $34 net gain or \~37% in a few weeks.  If not above $1, you still have the shares and just sell another call against them.

If willing to hold longer and think it will go up, call premiums are higher later months.  Sep 17 $2 strike for $.40 would get you $240 on the same $91 but you are holding the shares as collateral for 7 months but overall $149 gain/163% return potential (price has to be above $2 Sep 17 close).",Busy_Print6699,5,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lrso2s/daily_discussion_thread/gonrcnp/,0.036,0.882,0.082,0.5789

If you're gonna throw that much money at coin mining companies, why not just cut the middle man and invest in the cryptocurrency straight up? So many forecasts have crypto really ballooning as as the year goes on and the more reliable coins have proven quite capable at bouncing back from nasty corrections like the one this week. Probably missing something here but I just don't see the point in investing in these coin companies when they need the crypto itself to do well to have a chance at posting good prices. 

Beyond that......ugh I idk what to say. I could say try to show more caution before blasting so many penny stocks at once so hard but that's after the fact now.

398,GME," Could consider making a fractional share purchase. 

Before I got suckered full force into GME last time, I decided to literally buy $5 worth of a GME share when it was like 60-80 bucks or so and when the squeeze was really rolling that managed to make like 16 bucks off itself. $16 off 5! If GME explodes proportionally to a degree that even somewhat resembles what it did last time, even a fractional share of it could put out decent returns. Probably better than a lot of the pennies. 

Trying to scoop a ton of full price shares now is probably a bad idea but you could probably take a fractional dip at the right time and probably come out ok.",OKJMaster44,9,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lrso2s/daily_discussion_thread/goniq76/,0.035,0.82,0.145,0.8147

You can check out any ETF’s one week performance on RH and it’s moderate movement. 

Monday and Tuesday was  a good example when you might just throw into an ETF when everything was blood red and  if you weren’t confident buying on dips

There is no guarantee that waiting a week is going to lead to a better or different result... especially, when dealing with penny stocks.

My two cents... do DD and come up with a game plan that you're comfortable... what kind of return are you looking for, how much lost are you comfortable with, etc.

Then, dive in and set limit or stop orders if you want.  Or maybe consider non-penny stocks that have more stability... keeping in mind, volatility will always exist.",WhirlwindDragon,0,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lsd92k/wait_or_buy_the_dip/goqj0ew/,0.085,0.824,0.091,0.1531
