0,AAPL," Any decision I made with hesitation and fearing of big loss later one I found I made wrong decision. If a stop hits $5,,, it go back to visit $5, may be if it fall to $2. It is my experience I had one stock resisted temptation to sell it, if came down from 12 all the way to $8. But in two month or three it traded above $8 again. 
The biggest mistake I was ever making and proven me wrong again and again to get emotional sell a stock because it dropped $1 and bought another $1 only found out I lost more!!! 
I have 15K of a stock that has lost one dollar. Imagine 15K loss. I keep it. for last 2 months. All I do is selling covered call option. I make money ($200) a week since no one buy stock back to $2.50. I am fine, my contract expire each week until it is paid off completely. My be the stock will turn to penny in few months, but who cares??? I guess market price on option world doesn’t make much difference. 
It may seem funny in or two weeks I remember I made $600 because my contracts for $2.50 expiration was two years out. The volatility increased in the middle of week or something, my contract cost was almost $600. 
I know it would have been nice if I could sell the stock same day with 10c per share for profit. But I am not regretting either anymore. As long as it has an covered option choice and I can write one, I know I am fine. 
If I never sold my stocks years ago including AAPL in 2015 when it dropped from $123 to $102,,, I would have been in a millionaire now. 
But lets see.
I don’t believe in the classification of stock buyers day trader, swing option traders, I use them all. If a trade makes me 20c on Thursday, I see the option actually pays me $1 if I keep it over weekend for option to expire I choose the second one. Of course I can close the option it it makes immediate money and then sell the underlying as well.

But as everyone here said you should develop your own strategy and stick to it only wrong strategy is to sell your stock in panic.",Due_Apricot_9529,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/mqta5c/my_trading_plan_template_that_made_me/gukj8fo/,0.093,0.826,0.08,-0.6629
