1,GME," So when the big boys are reckless and greedy, almost causing a collapse of a financial system, the every person retail investor pays for it. What a surprise.

Brokers limited buying on the retail side and caused GME to tank. Now there will be a hearing and perhaps there will be some recommendations going forward and possibly a strongly worded letter. Meanwhile the retail investor is supposed to take up it the ass like they always do and the funds will go back to doing the same shit they've always done.

With the introduction of the internet and cheap or free brokers, the average person can invest or gamble on the stock market without paying fees to these funds. We're able to get a ticket into the same show as the big boys, even if we're not able to trade complex derivatives and such as they can.

->-<-

The quote below begins at 1:08.  This guy spells out the reality of the GME event, confirming that all of us on it were right (which we knew already).

Thomas Peterffy  
Interactive Brokers Founder and Chairman

""On January 28, the stock opened at $355, and traded up to $480.  At the same time, GME has 50M registered short shares outstanding, and a short interest of 70M shares.  In addition, there were about 1.5M calls, which would call for 150M shares. ...If the longs repay their margin loans and exercise the calls, their brokers would have been obligated by the rules, as they are today, to deliver to them 270 million shares while only 50 million shares existed.  So when the shorts cannot deliver the shares, the broker representing the longs must, must, by the rules of the system, go into the market and buy the shares at any price, pushing the price into the thousands.  So as the price goes higher, the shorts default on the brokers, and the brokers now must cover themselves.  That would push the price further up.""

270M shares shorted, when only 50M shares exist.  THAT IS ACTUALLY ILLEGAL.  And yet when asked if anyone is to blame, this guy answers that no one is to blame for what occurred.  The only answer more absurd is if he had said the retail investors were to blame.

Also, he said ""thousands.""  THOUSANDS.  That's per share, y'all.  

WE WERE RIGHT.  AND WE WERE SCREWED.

24,IBKR," ""Brilliant"" is not exactly how I would refer to him. I would go with ""Corrupt Market Manipulating Asshole"", personally.

In [his previous interview](https://streamable.com/ycdec9), he blatantly admits to market manipulation. He shut down trading on one side of a stock because he was ""very concerned about the brokers and clearinghouses."" He referred to Gamestop as a ""failing company"" and a ""little corner store"" and justified his decision to shut down trading on it because the stock wasn't worth what it was trading for. But, he is not a fucking regulator. When people who are not regulators take action to influence the behaviour of the market with the intention of artificially deflating the price of a security, that is the definition of market manipulation. It is not his position to tell the market what he thinks the company is worth.

If he wanted to eliminate margin trading on the stock to protect IBKR, fine, but that's not what he did. He shut down any purchase, even if it was made with pure cash. His brokerage participated in allowing short-traders to sell the stock short up to 147% without intervening. He had all the data in the world to tell him that those were risky positions, as the short info was all public. He doesn't get to use his platform to manipulate the stock price down because he doesn't agree with the market, and because his friends might lose money.

I had traded with IBKR for almost a decade, and shut down my account immediately afterwards. No fucking way I am giving that corrupt asshole any more of my business.",LemmingPractice,2,/r/stocks/comments/lm7x2n/interactive_brokers_chairman_peterffy_i_would/gnwdm6f/,0.076,0.866,0.058,-0.4562

65,BB," It's not the way things should be, but the answer is that the clearinghouse raising the collateral requirement on GME, BB, etc from 3% to 100% created a liquidity problem for the brokerages.  Some of them simply didn't have enough cash to post the necessary collateral, especially when the retail side of the market skewed to the buy side (significantly more retail buyers than sellers, no sells from there side to balance out the collateral required).

It's not obvious to a retail trader, but even in a cash brokerage account, if a broker is letting you sell a stock, then immediately letting you use the proceeds of the sale to buy some other stock, they're taking a slight risk that the transaction won't actually settle (the person you sold the stock to can't come up with the money).  The settlement process takes 3 days. The money you received from the sale isn't guaranteed to be delivered until settlement completes.

For an IRA account, a broker I had used to not let me use proceeds from a sale to buy something else until 3 days later, because otherwise they would have considered that money I spent as a loan (margin), which is dislowed for retirement accounts.  Eventually the whole industry started to interpret the  rules on IRAs differently and started floating the cash during settlement so that you could buy something else before settlement completed.

In any case, when the clearinghouse raised settlement collateral to 100%, some brokerages were too underfunded to be able to pay up (RobinHood, likely why the took the liquidity infusion from Citadel or whoever), or were too risk averse to be willing to tie up the extra liquidity (I bet IB falls in this bucket).

After satisfying the requirements of the clearing houses, Robinhood and other brokers continued to restrict the sale of GME and other stocks until the prices had dropped significantly due to them literally putting caps on the number of shares retail investors could buy.

They saw that GME was going nuts and was going to pop, so they stopped all buying. No reasons mentioned.

They robbed retail GME holders and then made up reasons after the fact. The CEO of IBKR said they were a big company and had plenty of liquidity. He said the reason they stopped buying was because GME was valued at $17 and not $250 at the time of the interview. Did they ever stop their customers from buying any other tickers before?

The fact of the matter is they do what is good for them or the people in power. Little retail investors get the shaft and get lied to later on. There is no one that will do a thing.

They weren't satisfied with the money they already made shorting it, they wanted it to go bankrupt for maximum profits. When retail caught wind of this, people took a gamble which would have paid off immensely if it wasn't for the rules being changed mid game. 

They didn't halt trading. They limited buying for retail only. The allowed selling so funds could cover their shorts. It's despicable practice and no wonder people feel hard done by.

81,BY," The guy made it abundantly clear why IB in particular decided to shut down trading: they were on the hook to repurchase shares to settle contracts (THAT THEY WILLINGLY ASSUMED RISK FOR BY UNDERWRITING). They knew they’d go bankrupt if they didn’t take steps to prevent people from continuing to drive up the price. They fucked up and chose to fuck retail traders to save themselves. To not recognize that is either you ignoring what he’s saying and getting lost in the details of T+2, or worse: you intentionally misleading others to shift blame away from brokerages.

Edit: it’s unfortunate Reddit is easily swayed by takes like this guy’s^ and the guy in the video. Wall Street will keep fucking people over because people eat up these takes from people who sound like they know what they’re talking about.

Brokers were allowing people to close their open positions so that people could manage their existing risk.  You're upset because you wanted to buy more and couldn't (or more likely, you wanted other people to buy more, and they couldn't).   However, brokers continued to allow closing of open positions, whether that was buying to close a short or selling to close a long.   The brokerage wasn't willing to create more risk for itself by allowing people to enter new positions.

A financial firm can never broadcast that they have a liquidity problem.  That's what triggers bank runs.  The very fact that they have to mention that they don't have a liquidity problem is suspect.

>If people have fully funded cash accounts, then they can buy GME. People literally had money in their accounts and weren't allowed to buy GME at all. There is no risk when the cash is in your account and the broker locks it up once you make a purchase.

There's absolutely risk, just not to you.  You could have ""bought"", and the counterparty could fail to deliver.  Someone is on the hook to make that right, and they might have to pay exorbitant amount to buy shares on the open market to get your shares to you, and they might have to pay way more than the price you thought you paid in order to do that.  Sure, that's ""not your problem"", but no one else is obligated to take on that risk to do business with you, especially for $0 in commissions.

There's a reason that different brokerages charge different amounts of commission.  Super cheap or free commission brokerages like RH, IB, etc. have to run their business in a certain way to make those commissions free.  It's not magic.   One of the things you get from a full service brokerage is usually a firm that has deep liquidity, the ability to stand behind it's trades, etc.  RH doesn't have that ability, and IBKR strictly manages it's risks to keep it's commissions very low while maintaining healthy liquidity.  I've been an IB customer for over a decade.  I've seen them constantly adjust margin requirements on futures and stocks.  It's a core part of their business model for staying solvent at the prices they charge.

It's a free market.  If you don't like how RH managed their business, it would be good to take your accounts elsewhere.  Fidelity didn't halt trading on any of the meme stocks and was able to stand behind its customers trades.  However, you'll likely pay more in commissions and fees at Fidelity, because they provide a higher level of service.

Steve Cohen famously never takes a discount on commissions. In his case, it's mainly to make sure that he gets tipped insider information by being a good customer of the brokerage.

100,DOW," I think it would be more the fact that  the hedge funds who heavily shorted GME would have been margin called on their positions, they would have to of liquidated some if not most of their positions to cover, the reparative naked short selling led to phantom shares, meaning they would have to cover their short positions more than once, and maybe more depending on how many actual shares were being sold, literally would have had to buy every single share, and then some being over 100% short. The amount of calls OTM would then be ITM meaning money markers would have to cover those as well. The ‘theory’ is this would have not just bankrupted some hedge funds (in the process force liquidation of all their positions, and say the DOW react on Thursday in a negative trend to this) but then had them owing more money which they did not have, leaving the brokers and DTCC to cover. It lead to a unique event where if retailers never sold, the price in theory would continue to go up forever, as the shorts would be forced to buy and then re sell their own potions, then re buy them again.

101,GME," I think it would be more the fact that  the hedge funds who heavily shorted GME would have been margin called on their positions, they would have to of liquidated some if not most of their positions to cover, the reparative naked short selling led to phantom shares, meaning they would have to cover their short positions more than once, and maybe more depending on how many actual shares were being sold, literally would have had to buy every single share, and then some being over 100% short. The amount of calls OTM would then be ITM meaning money markers would have to cover those as well. The ‘theory’ is this would have not just bankrupted some hedge funds (in the process force liquidation of all their positions, and say the DOW react on Thursday in a negative trend to this) but then had them owing more money which they did not have, leaving the brokers and DTCC to cover. It lead to a unique event where if retailers never sold, the price in theory would continue to go up forever, as the shorts would be forced to buy and then re sell their own potions, then re buy them again.

You wouldn’t get your GME’s 100000 valuation because the market along with GME already crashed, you might not even get your GME shares because your discount broker probably went under and SIPC ran out of money to hand out.

If you remember that the day after $GME hits $400, that Friday(?) there's a massive sell off, part of that are people getting margin called, which causes liquidation of stock, which causes more people to be margin called because of the dive, and it's a feedback loop and can keep going and lead to a flash crash.

It may be an industry difference between the industry I work in and the automotive industry, but a lack of a dev community would typically make working with that service harder, take longer and be more error prone.

I also don't believe in the argument that BB's ISO 26262 certification is as much of a protection as I've been reading in other DDs. Doing a brief search I found two other OS's working on getting certified or who already are:

(Why it matters, in some cases open source software can be more secure since anyone can review the code for vulnerabilities and do their own due diligence instead of just believing the company trying to sell to you. Emphasis on ""in some cases"", there are cons to open source software too)

They are going to have to work very hard to show that their new business is sustainable, scalable and profitable. Once they get that demonstrated, and I think they can, they will soar. Now, if they hit a few roadblocks, lose ground, or have some bad news, then the market will punish them disproportionately.   


In other words the short term is this is a high risk-high reward trade with a lot of volatility. You must have a long term play of at least 12 months.

166,BB," Interesting to see the full scope.

I would now like to see (if I can't do it myself), the impact this has vs the positives in future prices.

Obviously, there is a lot of risk in being wrong with such an analysis, but it would be interesting to see.

Good investors know that future contracts are not the same as money now (what destroyed Enron), but I'm wondering if QNX will be impacted by any of these.

To note, low volume of car purchases would strongly affect their QNX model. Not only would they not make as much because of lost sales, but car companies might not be as willing to partner with an autonomy oriented software company, while focusing instead on making companies more lean, reducing spending on R&D effectively.

Is it fair to say that it all depends greatly on the trends of the regular market? If so, how much cash does BB have on hand? This is vital for an R&D company during a recession. Their overall standing matters as well - retaining employees who like to work there, as well as how willing a bank is to loan them money are incredibly important from my viewpoint as a potential investor. 

If a recession puts QNX back 5 years, will they be impacted by their competition? Looking at Tesla, they have a cash balance to stride through a recession with ease. Banks are salivating to give them a loan and individual investors are lining up to throw money at them.

It's one of the reasons I believe Southwest will do well. They've proven they have a strong foothold in a market time where cash reserves are important.

Note: cash reserves by themselves are meaningless if it's not attached to meaningful progress. Having QNX as intellectual property becomes a liability unless spending their cash reserves don't automatically bankrupt them, and they have to offload this software to another company.",jhuntinator27,0,/r/stocks/comments/lmcvkk/blackberry_bear_case/gnwjm5m/,0.089,0.732,0.179,0.9853

How many L6s do you think make up the workforce vis-a-vis developers doing the day to day work?

What percentage do you think that is?  Since you seem to know more than me about this, I look forward to hearing your BS, err, I mean ""answer"".

> It's all in hip startups where engineers become overnight millionaires whenever firm IPO or one of the well established companies. If your tech company isn't growing top talents aren't interested

The reality is, other than you have ZERO idea what you are talking about, is 4 in 5 tech startups fail... AND before they become overnight millionaires -- that's usually only for a subset of the staff anyway -- that's only after multiple rounds of Series funding.  Before that, there's a lot of scraping by, eating ramen, and living with 4-5 roomates in the Bay Area.  

Yes, FAANG salaries are nice and all.  But suggesting $200K is entry level, seniors make $500K, and other tech companies cannot attract talent is says a LOT more about you than it does me.

The **median** software engineer salary package for bay area is 240k according to levels, fyi. There is a reason why cost of living and real estate is so high here, tons of tech millionaires.

Okay well let's check some out. You can find average TC on levels and also median if you check out the salary ranges box slightly below on each of these pages. I'll go ahead and be referring to them mostly as one in the same since it looks like for most the median and average are roughly equivalent.

so among FAAMG only F and G really pay anywhere near what you're claiming. And even then the average and median aren't 200k. I did not include Netflix since they only have senior engineer data on hand. Sure it's not unheard of for junior engineers to get offered that, and you can certainly find other unicorn companies in SV that do pay upwards of 200k but that is hardly the norm for ""well known"" tech companies. For any one of those I could probably find you 5 more that pay in the 130k - 140k range.

Yes, the data you've linked to takes into account all different levels of software engineers though, not just juniors. I don't really see your point in bringing this up. Yes experienced engineers make nice money in SV, I'm not denying that. I took issue with what you were claiming most junior engineers enter the field making 200k and the fact you were saying $500k isn't uncommon. 200k is pretty extraordinary for juniors, hardly the industry norm. A select few unicorns will pay that and a few FAANG will pay that to some juniors but as you can see above that isn't the median for junior engineers. 

Also you can see in the very data that you linked to, a $500k TC puts you in the 98th-99th percentile of engineers. This is the top 1% of engineers... saying a salary like this is ""not uncommon"" is wild.

235,IRS," If someone used Robinhood during 2020, and made gains/losses, Robinhood is going to submit tax forms for their Social Security Number to the IRS for those gains/losses.  Even if they have since pulled out their money and transferred their positions to a different brokerage, Robinhood is still on the hook for tax reporting purposes for any trades you made at their brokerage.  And the individual is on the hook for including those gains/losses on their taxes.  Less so the losses though, the IRS doesn't care if you don't claim something that would save you money.

The confusion might be because we have what are called ""taxable events"".  For stocks, it is basically anytime you execute a trade you are taxed on any gains at that moment.  You also reduce your tax liability if an event incurs a loss.  One common exception is what is called a wash sale, which is where you sell a position making a gain or loss and then reenter that position within 30 days.  In this scenario, your cost basis is adjusted based on the gains or losses and the gain or loss is pushed off to the next taxable event for that position.",lord_dentaku,13,/r/stocks/comments/lmidyp/check_your_tax_form_on_robinhood_robinhood_is/gnw07st/,0.088,0.825,0.086,0.1388

I’m with ya - I don’t understand the folks who are down on Apple.

Their customer loyalty is absurd - and they get their hooks into kids at 14 and they never go away.

80% retention rate for iPhone users. Being a teacher around 13-18 year olds - I can tell you they just about all have iPhones. And there’s a lot of them with AirPods too.

And that’s just hardware - which isn’t their most profitable revenue stream. Their services - which is ever expanding - has a 63.7% gross profit margin (compared to 32.2% in the hardware/product section).

With the increase in Apple Music, health, Apple TV streaming, iCloud storage, etc - you’ll see that revenue go up - which is largely profit.

Apple isn’t going to jump 20% in a month. But it’s the LeBron James of stocks. It might have some bad games - but over the season you’ll look back and it is in the talk for another MVP.",Washedup11,282,/r/stocks/comments/lm7zp9/extremely_bullish_on_apple_now/gntqzr2/,0.027,0.912,0.061,0.5569

303,SE," Honestly, the entry level products from Apple (Macbooks and iMac's aside), are excellent value.

They've definitely avoided inflating prices when their iPad's start at 330 (fairly regularly go on sale for like 250) when they launched at 499 and their iPhones have been between 650 and 750 for like 8 years. Yet each one gets 5 years of software support and you can have them change the battery with an official newly made one for like 80 bucks.

Course, I'm a geek and a cheapass so I go the used android flagship + self repair route. But my Pixel 3 just broke for no reason and right now an iPhone 12 is way more appealing to me than paying 800 for a Samsung that's been heavily cut down over the past 3 years from before (plastic back, no expandable storage, no headphone jack, no MST, 1080p screen, etc) and will only get like 2 software updates. And that I'm gonna have to either carry a power brick, replace, or rip apart to swap the battery with a hopefully not degraded one from eBay in a few years.

305,EDU," I agree, I am an IT professional who solely uses Apple products - so this is coming from an Apple fanboy. I manage two schools IT and they both are migrating away from being 100% apple to Google education. It’s more than just devices - Google has an entire eco system for schools. 

It massively cheaper for the schools. Free email for whole org, $200 laptops for students. When the students wreck the hardware (common in lower school) it’s cheap to replace. Broken iMacs and iPads cost the schools a ton of cash.

Managing Apple devices from IT has always been challenging IMO. Not saying yo can’t do it, but it’s not fun or reliable. Chrome for education is the easiest hardware management platform I’ve ever used. I literally register device and done. Literally 5 minutes and the device is deployed to students.

I love apple, own stock in Apple. I think they still have a place in education. But Google is definitely eroding Apple education hook they’ve had for decades. Even worse for them MS is starting to get into this game as well with windows for EDU and cheaper laptops. 

I’m just saying you will start to see less apple in grade school in the years to come.

327,EV," Always loved Honda’s cars. One thing I remember my lecturers saying (currently studying mechanical engineering) is that Honda make some of the most reliable and amazing engines around, and for a couple reasons I think that translates to lower sales volumes than other manufacturers; their products have a massive aftermarket parts market due to its tuning culture (especially the Civic range), which Honda isn’t making money on; and, at least in Britain, folk buy their cars purely because they buy them once - a lot of their cars, minus the Civic, are seen as ‘older folks’ cars. Almost all my friends with Hondas have had them for over a decade and have pumped thousands into upgrading and keeping them powerful - and none of this revenue goes back to Honda, although it speaks volumes for their craftsmanship. 
I hope their move into the EV market is just as renowned as their Internal Combustion engines, but given that Toyota and Tesla are market innovators with their PMSync electric motors, I’ll be intrigued what Honda can bring to the table - especially given how divisive the new Honda E model is. 
Totally agree though with you though, their stock is undervalued and I’ll be snapping some up shortly!

They will go full EV, and this might go against the reason they started building cars - they had the best engines, and needed some products in order to sell engines (...can't find the reference now, but this is tribal knowledge...).

I own 2 recent model Acuras (including the NSX-technology derived MDX-sport-hybrid). Prior to that almost all my cars were Honda's with a couple of exceptions.

Point to note is that my (3 electric motor + 1 V6 engine) MDX does a few miles on pure EV mode, limited by the small battery. All they have to do is increase the size of that battery and we'd have a beast. After my warranty runs out, I'll look at increasing this capacity.

Did a test drive with a Tesla model X, and I so wanted to get back to my MDX even during that drive. The MDX's Vtec engine along with the 3 motors can propel this SUV with a kick in the chest, and yet I feel so much in control.

336,CD," I think Honda makes a fantastic, solid, and reliable vehicle right now and will continue to do so into the near-future when the industry move to electric motors.

Where my mind begins to wander is when it comes to self-driving technology; I am reminded of what happened to SONY when the electronics industry moved from mostly-hardware controlled devices (like portable CD players) to devices that relied heavily on hardware/software interplay like the iPod. The Japanese were unable to compete because their expertise was not in software (at least at that time).

I'm not sure if things have changed, but I'd be willing to bet that good software companies will become much more prevalent in the car industry because of their reliance on software. By no means am I saying that Tesla and Apple will overtake the industry, but is there room in the market for a Microsoft? Will the car industry become separate hardware companies that run the same software that a few companies make? Or will each car company have its own proprietary technology?

I get that Honda will likely do what the Japanese do best - that is, to reverse engineer electric engines and make them more efficient and reliable, but what will the software approach be to the market as a whole?

372,GME," As others have said, it's a lot of reasons that can't really be simplified and I'm not going to rehash. But a good place to start looking to understand short-term market moves is in the day's headlines. So here are some from today: 

Yesterday afternoon it was reported that the Pfizer vaccine isn't as effective vs. the South Africa strain of COVID. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/pfizer-shot-produces-fewer-antibodies-versus-south-africa-strain

Jobless claims numbers were much worse than expected:
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weekly-jobless-claims-week-ended-february-13-labor-market-190229296.html

It also may not help that Walmart, a blue chip/retail titan, missed earnings today. That sort of miss can be a drag on overall market sentiment. https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/walmart-wmt-earnings-q4-2021.html

Then there's the dog and pony show of Gamestop Congressional hearings today, which may amount to nothing. But we saw some market volatility during the whole GME bubble, so it's not out of the question. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2021-02-12/robinhood-citadel-reddit-executives-testify-at-gamestop-hearing

It could also be as simple as the weather in Texas and now parts of the northeast getting a bunch more snow today. (I'm in NY and getting 5-10 inches today). Whether or not that matters is up for debate:
https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/111015/does-weather-affect-stock-market.asp

These are just a few possibilities for today specifically. In the overall scheme of things, these sorts of red days are largely noise that you can ignore. But if you're interested, it's worth keeping an eye on Yahoo Finance/Bloomberg/etc. Just be careful about getting too caught up in the narratives.",FoundOmega,3,/r/stocks/comments/lmnqhs/can_someone_eli5_why_sometimes_the_whole_market/gnwlomm/,0.08,0.882,0.039,-0.7635

679,GME," To be blunt the broadmarket ETFs are far safer. You're taking risks you don't realize yet.

Keep in mind if you're investing in a broad market ETF and it crashes, it will recover, it might take a few years in the worst of times. What is important is not to get solely stuck with the hot-potato companies that go out of business. When you build a full portfolio you leave money you need for the coming 6 months, 12 months, 24 months in much more conservative investments (savings accounts, Bonds, low volatility dividend stocks). Then you put higher amounts, things that it is alright if they crash for a couple years, in riskier broad market ETFs or broadmarket growth ETFs. That minimizes risk.

If you do that, you've made it. You can have a full retirement fund within 10-15 years with limited risks.

Good investing is a long-term strategy. To do what you did takes great risks with the money you started with. Basically every dollar you just made, someone else had lost playing in the GME craziness trying to do similar things. GME wasn't structurally doing better as a company to increase it's value. That was a rare occurrence.

If you try to recreate this success, you could lose much of what you made.

At a minimum, take a large chunk of the money you made and make a good safe portfolio that is safer and likely to make life easier for you later in life.

 Then choose a small portion to be your riskier, let's do this again.... If that works, then keep working riskier stuff with just that portion. If you lose that portion, don't take anymore. If you gain alot, keep using that money. You can always have a good amount stashed away in your broadmarket ETFs, whether you do good or bad in that situation.",cwdawg15,6,/r/stocks/comments/lmfp4v/is_there_any_point_in_holding_stocksetfs/gnv4455/,0.13,0.736,0.135,0.7067

Rick Perry just said something like ""Texans would rather be without power than be regulated by the federal gov."" (who, in theory, would have made them update the grid and be prepared for this). Note: Texas is happy to ask for federal relief for the disaster.

Second, dividend paying stocks and ETFs pay dividends on different dates. Owning multiple dividend stocks distributes the income more evenly. 

For example, T pays a quarterly dividend in the cycle that begins in January, and WM pays a quarterly dividend in the February cycle. So own MSFT, T, and WM would result in a monthly paycheck.

Personally I think PERI represents the best upside at current valuations, they are priced at only 2x sales despite 50% growth last quarter and 100% in ctv growth. 

I have owned all three in the past year, but currently only hold a position in PERI",mcoclegendary,1,/r/stocks/comments/lmax01/the_trade_desk_ttd_strong_outlook_but_very/gnv105p/,0.053,0.734,0.213,0.9011

900,TX," Much speculation on what the cause is/was, but Europe went through a very similar issue last year that was caused by the renewable energy causing the grid to become unstable when power demand skyrocketed due to extreme cold weather.  This caused the frequency to become erratic which caused some of the baseload power to trip offline.  Europe is able to split their grid in 2 and this minimized the effect, but they were very close to having an entire continental blackout.  I will wait to see what the findings are in TX before I place blame on anything.",nukerunner2121,2,/r/stocks/comments/lmvrql/why_are_clean_energy_stocks_selling_off_texas/gnxeu05/,0.094,0.839,0.067,-0.2145

942,HYRE," Do you know what caused the increase of \~68 million common shares between 8/5 and 2/11? Were warrants exercised? Did the firm issue  a follow offering in that time frame?

You can look at the balance sheet in that time frame to  determine the reporting period where the dilution event took place.

Penny/OTC stocks are little sketchy in that the following scenario happens quite a bit:

* Investor A has a warrant in Company B (which is an opportunity to buy a stock at a pre-defined price) for example: $1
* The stock goes to $5
* Investor A exercises the warrant, now has $5 stock in Company B
* Investor A sells $5 stock, has $4 profit
* Investor A loans Company B $3 as convertible debt @ 10%  (loan with option to convert to stock) at $6. Pending a miracle, company B can't actually service this debt. It will be converted to common stock.

At this point Investor A has made a guaranteed 100% return ($1 + $1 = 2), earns 10% of the $3 investment w/ an option to buy at $6 if the stock goes above.

Its a real shit deal for the everyone who isn't Investor A, and happens quite a bit. Most people don't follow this because theyre in and out of penny stocks but the owners of these stocks are the LITERAL BAG HOLDERS. I don't know anything about your company but I bet that is what's happening...or a follow on offering.

A dilution, follow on offering, etc will not cause a ""rush to buy"" because of a supply demand mis match:

&#x200B;

* Company B is worth 100 shares x $10 share = $1000
* Company B has follow on offering for 10 more shares at $9
* Is Company B now worth (100 shares x $10 ) + (10 shares x $ 9) = $1090?

No.  Investors will sell on the event of a dilution activity which will create more supply than demand ; maybe the share price will drop to $9 or sub $9 immediately afterwards so on an $8.50 per share basis you would have

* 110 x $8.50 = $935

The company is now worth $65 less than before the dilution event. This recently happened w/ HYRE ; you can see it in their 30 day window.

&#x200B;

Regarding the 550,000 shares I would look at the option statistics (if available) to see if that could be related e.g. person is covering or a pump/dump is about to happen.

946,GME," I have been using Schwab, Robinhood and Webull.

Schwab has definitely beaten the other two. It never gave me any issues, even during the GME fiasco. The only problem I have with it is the 65 cent fee per options contract. I negotiated it down to 30 cents but its still high compared to TW.

Webull is ok. Their trading hours are great, 4am to 8pm. They did stop GME purchases though since they use APEX as a clearing house and didn't have enough funds. 

Robinhood has the best UI but everything else is shit. Getting fills on spreads is next to impossible unless you accept to lose 5 dollars or more per spread. They also obviously didn't have enough money to use as collateral during the GME fiasco. Their customer support is also shit.

In addition to ATM stations, DBD manufactures the tabletop credit card kiosks found in restaurants used for paying the tab.  As restaurants re-open, with the prospect of the $15/hour minimum wage, attempts will be made to reduce overhead.  I would expect demand for these kiosks to be brisk.

1011,AMC," I used to work for a Hollywood studio and Amazon would be interested in AMC not for the reasons most people think. They actually only want less than a dozen actual theaters. The issue is that cinema exhibition is not profitable and Amazon has always been against physical retail.

Amazon and Netflix would have an interest in a handful of theaters as their films are ineligible for Oscars without cinema exhibition.

But to meet the Oscar requirement, it only needs to be in a handful of theaters for a period of time. Disney owns about a half dozen theaters to meet that requirement for any sort of minor film release they want for Oscar consideration but don't want to pay for a wide release.

Amazon could achieve the same thing for much less buy purchasing a couple of ma and pa independent theaters. 

Amazon is better off with some sort of partnership with AMC that doesn't really put them into the exhibition business.

1029,CG," Yeah so short term gains basically match your marginal tax bracket, which does have different levels.

Long term gains also are subject to your income, but have broad groups and don't match the same rate. Can be 0, 15, 20%. Are 15% for most people.

I might have worded poorly but meant timewise there are only two levels- less than a year and greater than a year. Anything beyond a year and it's long term CG, but there's no explicit benefit from going say 5 years. (However like I said, tax drag would be an implicit).
