0,DD," Im doing the same, mostly, with the exception of holding a couple things a bit longer when DD says its good.

Additionally Im starting with a bit higher initial investment ($800) plus whatever I add as I go (I normally only spend about 40% of monthly work income, save  40%, and the remaining 20% goes to investing now).

End goal? 200k by 2023 with hopes of using that to bolster planned downpayment so fiance and I can move anywhere we want instead of being limited by housing we can afford. Right now we can logically get to a downpayment for a $500k home by 2023 with the current rate I'm saving alone (She currently is solo paying our mortgage, so she's not included in this portion of the process). If I manage to actually hit 200k, then we can essentially buy the house we want in any part of our state.

Hell, if I hit 300k saved then I can DEFINITELY buy any house I want. But Im not gonna get my hopes that far up.

In theory if I mange to hit 7% a week (currently at double that), then I'll hit 1.7 mil in 2 years, but that is prolly not gonna actually pop off.",FlamingCurry,6,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lg88jj/from_500_to_100000_weekly_log/gmq3t2w/,0.029,0.895,0.077,0.6875

I’d recommend a few items; 
- Don’t blindly follow picks here, do a little self research. Sometimes the info you need is in the comments too. 
- Twitter can be your friend. Example, $OGEN will show you what folks are talking about in relation to that ticker 
- don’t be afraid to take profits. Not every trade will be a homerun, but every position is movement towards the goal. 
- don’t beat yourself up if you take a small loss or sell a day early. It happens. 

Good luck!

200,CEO," The way I manage risk--and still avoid missing out on huge runs--is by taking profits along the way but always keeping some if I like the company based on REAL NEWS that has been announced that explains the WHY a stock has moved up.  I try not to buy just because it is moving up. I need to know from press releases and due diligence on their website to feel comfortable enough to keep  a portion of my original investment.

  
For example, late last year I bought into a company when they filed for a name change to Curative Biotech from an older tech name. (The stock is CTYX).  The name change has not happened YET, but other news --press releases-- showed that they were filign to get rights to orphan drugs. So that showed they were REALLY going to be in biotech. Plus the CEO has a background in that field. 

So, after buying in at .008 and .013 and .068-- it is at .19 today because of news last week from the NIH.  

I guess I should have taken some profits by now, but the name change has not been announced and it has been over 2 months since they filed.

257,LOVE," $RESN was talked about very briefly on this sub several months ago, but while it has crossed over the $5 threshold to not really be considered a penny stock, I got in w/ 155 shares at $6.45.  Closed 2/8 @ $7.45.

The key product RESN has is a 5G filter, XBAR, that removes ""noise"" (for a lack of a better term) around the 5G operating range to help boost bandwidth and lower latencies significantly.

https://www.resonant.com/news-resources/5gwave2 

They demoed their product back in 2019 to much fanfare within the wireless industry.

So, why are they so special and why should you even consider getting in now?

All RESN has to do is secure 1 contract with the likes of Apple, Qualcomm, any cellular provider and then this stock goes to Alpha Centauri.

I can foresee Apple integrating this into their next SoC for the iPhone 13.  Apple would do LOVE to be able to boast about having the best 5G modem.  I wouldn't put it past Apple to contractually have exclusivity for their handset for this tech for at least a year.  RESN should be free to sell to cellular companies and Wireless LAN controller manufactures as Apple would need that tech on both sides to make it work effectively. 

Naturally, RESN would be put under crazy NDAs and could never tell anyone if/when they secured a contract with Apple.  Think about what happened today with Apple and Hyundai/Kia where Apple pulled out because Hyundai blabbed about it - Hyundai's stock took a hit today because of that.

Their last quarterly earnings was on 11/10/2020, so that means that March 10th will be a good day for you if you get in now.",shifty21,8,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lftsjs/watchlist_2921/gmnyjyx/,0.028,0.801,0.171,0.9939

Thanks for the update.
Glad I found this site.
I’ll be honest. I just got started trading with my pocket cash this year (not a New Years resolution thing). Just wanted to get my feet wet. My 410k money is doing great with “my guy”. I let him make calls on where best to invest so I road a couple of his pics in the beginning and made good bank. Plug, GEVO, SENS for example.
Made great gains in all but no longer hold them in my pocket money portfolio. Still going long in the IRA!!!
Long story short, got caught up I. The GME,AMC rally
(The Day after the hype) and got stung. Made some but lost more. The worst part was we’re the emotional swings. Am I gonna get rich or loose it all. Didn’t sleep much that weekend and felt like someone was punching me in the guy all weekend. 
Bottom line is. Be patient and DD will pay off in the long run. My thanks to everyone here for their insight and contributions. It’s made me a better investor and a better partner with my 401k too.",wtf-is-going,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lg0d4o/zsan_pre_market_madness/gmoyz1p/,0.073,0.749,0.178,0.9664

436,LOVE," $RESN was talked about very briefly on this sub several months ago, but while it has crossed over the $5 threshold to not really be considered a penny stock, **I got in w/ 155 shares at $6.45.** Closed 2/8 @ $7.45.

The key product RESN has is a 5G filter, XBAR, that removes ""noise"" (for a lack of a better term) around the 5G operating range to help boost bandwidth and lower latencies significantly.

https://www.resonant.com/news-resources/5gwave2

They demoed their product back in 2019 to much fanfare within the wireless industry.

So, why are they so special and why should you even consider getting in now?

All RESN has to do is secure 1 contract with the likes of Apple, Qualcomm, any cellular provider and then this stock goes to Alpha Centauri.

I can foresee Apple integrating this into their next SoC for the iPhone 13. Apple would do LOVE to be able to boast about having the best 5G modem. I wouldn't put it past Apple to contractually have exclusivity for their handset for this tech for at least a year. RESN should be free to sell to cellular companies and Wireless LAN controller manufactures as Apple would need that tech on both sides to make it work effectively.

Naturally, RESN would be put under crazy NDAs and could never tell anyone if/when they secured a contract with Apple. Think about what happened today with Apple and Hyundai/Kia where Apple pulled out because Hyundai blabbed about it - Hyundai's stock took a hit today because of that.

437,RESN," $RESN was talked about very briefly on this sub several months ago, but while it has crossed over the $5 threshold to not really be considered a penny stock, **I got in w/ 155 shares at $6.45.** Closed 2/8 @ $7.45.

The key product RESN has is a 5G filter, XBAR, that removes ""noise"" (for a lack of a better term) around the 5G operating range to help boost bandwidth and lower latencies significantly.

https://www.resonant.com/news-resources/5gwave2

They demoed their product back in 2019 to much fanfare within the wireless industry.

So, why are they so special and why should you even consider getting in now?

All RESN has to do is secure 1 contract with the likes of Apple, Qualcomm, any cellular provider and then this stock goes to Alpha Centauri.

I can foresee Apple integrating this into their next SoC for the iPhone 13. Apple would do LOVE to be able to boast about having the best 5G modem. I wouldn't put it past Apple to contractually have exclusivity for their handset for this tech for at least a year. RESN should be free to sell to cellular companies and Wireless LAN controller manufactures as Apple would need that tech on both sides to make it work effectively.

Naturally, RESN would be put under crazy NDAs and could never tell anyone if/when they secured a contract with Apple. Think about what happened today with Apple and Hyundai/Kia where Apple pulled out because Hyundai blabbed about it - Hyundai's stock took a hit today because of that.

576,TNXP," I have had luck with three stocks this week in particular.

1. [UUUU](https://robinhood.com/stocks/UUUU) \- Energy Fuels - Bought 2 shares 6 days ago @ $4.32 is up to $5.43.
2. [NXE](https://robinhood.com/stocks/NXE) \- NexGen Energy - Bought 2 shares 6 days ago @ $3.31 is up to $3.91.
3. [DNN](https://robinhood.com/stocks/DNN) \- Denison Mines - Bought 2 shares 6 days ago @ $0.745 is up to $0.918.

Nothing amazing or anything that is going to allow me to retire in the next week but these appear to be trending upwards steadily. With a renewed push away from fossil fuels, all segments of alternative energy are looking to increase. These three companies are in uranium mining and that is one segment that is experiencing an uptick in interest. The link below leads to the article that led me to invest in these three companies.

The offering is expected to close by February 9.

* A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners is acting as the sole placement agent for the offering.
* Earlier today, Tonix [received a written response from the FDA](https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/21/02/g19532272/tonix-pharmaceuticals-to-develop-covid-19-skin-test-tnx-2100-to-measure-sars-cov-2-exposure-and-t-?utm_campaign=partner_feed&utm_source=yahooFinance&utm_medium=partner_feed&utm_content=site) to a Type B pre-investigational new drug meeting package describing its technology and plans to develop a diagnostic skin test, TNX-2100 (SARS-CoV-2 epitope peptide mixtures for intradermal administration), to measure the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2).
* TNX-2100 is designed to measure T cell immunity to CoV-2 and comprises three different mixtures of synthetic peptides (TNX-2110, -2120, and -2130), which are designed to represent different protein components of the CoV-2 virus.
* Each of these three tests would be administered as part of the same procedure at separate locations on the forearm. Each is expected to elicit a DTH response after approximately 48 hours in individuals with pre-existing T cell immunity to peptides in that mixture.
* Last month, the company [raised million via equity](https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/21/01/g19152167/tonix-pharmaceuticals-holdings-corp-closes-40m-common-stock-offering-priced-at-the-market-under-na?utm_campaign=partner_feed&utm_source=yahooFinance&utm_medium=partner_feed&utm_content=site) sale of 50 million shares at $0.80 per share.

666,OCGN," Quality over quanitity.....ALWAYS, but especially when you're first starting out and trying to get a small account off the ground.

In your case, my advice would be to sell anything that is in the green over the coming days to free up some capital.

Then, I would try to hover around 4-6 stocks with more shares (and thus, capital) invested in each. But here's the kicker - if you are going to focus on 4-6 stocks, you need those to be bangers! So take your time, be patient, and don't be afraid to sit out a day or two if nothing gets your attention.

Again, and I can't stress this enough - quality over quantity!

Something I've noticed just from observing this board over the last couple years -- if a a stock is talked about A LOT - I mean, if it's mentioned in the daily thread a lot and even has individual threads started on it - it is probably a safe pick. Meaning it's not just a day or two pump and actually has some catalysts behind it. EXAMPLES: ZOM, SENS, OCGN.

742,ATOS," If we look at the three year support and resistance, we can see the $4.90 high as the beginning of setting a new support and resistance. With phase 2 nasal spray coming out & the positive breast cancer treatment results as the driving marketplace catalyst, this brief consolidation to $3.90 is seen by many as a tremendous time for retail investors to beef up their position. If you feel the $7 target is at reach like most analyst do, this new support can be an opportune time to drive deeper ROI’s. If you feel there is less risk by waiting until it gets to $5 p/s, then that could be your time.
It’s growing fast, less than $1 a month ago, and almost hit 5, this is a fast moving trajectory from a percentage standpoint .
The good news for the company is institutional investors likely will  start taking more stake in ATOS, the bad news for retail folks trying to time a perfect entry is that a massive injection from institutions will shoot the share price up rather quickly. I think that’s what will drive share purchases this week.

Make sure you’re derisking (example: sell 1/2 your shares at 2.88 to get back your initial investment) . Some people will tell you winning early on in their investing career is worse than losing. It creates unrealistic expectations and you chase those highs.

897,DD," I have come to the exact same conclusions as you from the same DD research.  I think at the minimum the upside to this stock is going to bring it consistently in the $2-3 range, which represents a good investment currently.

The POTENTIAL upside is gigantic. Consistent positive results for just one of the 3 items in the pipeline will lead $10+ stock price, minimum. And that's just from positive news, not even full release. If either the fibromyalgia treatment or Covid skin test actually make it to market, we're looking at triple digit stock prices.

This is certainly not guaranteed, and I'm just estimating based on historic precedent, similar company stock, and what I believe the market for these things are. While I think the buzz is surrounding Covid stuff, my personal knowledge of the firo landscape tells me it is in desperate need of an effective competitor to the current therapies. If Tonix develops a drug with more generalized positive results(ie helps a larger percentage of sufferers than current medications), it will dominate the market.

Currently, when you think fibromyalgia, you think Cymbalta or Lyrica. These are rated as helping reduce the pain from FM by about ~25%. How they measure that is a bit unclear to me, but I don't have a background in biology. I can read studies but still, a bit beyond me. For comparison, placebo has about a 13% reduction in pain.

If Tonix medication can improve on that, and/or reduce side effects, it can explode.",hsilman,8,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lg42kz/update_on_tnxp_been_above_2_premarket_dd_part_2/gmpbb9z/,0.052,0.871,0.078,0.6858

This is definitely a long term hold stock conversation. I remember when they went public about 2 years ago. Today, the company is considered undervalued compared to their competitors.

Right answer right here. The only nuance to add is the post earlier today explaining that there's never a good answer to ""how long should I hold?"" We can gain a ton of respectable dd and ridiculously poignant insight from this community but at the end of the day nobody knows what the stock market is going to do.

Now I want to shoutout AGTC, we only have a few days left to talk about it here. Check my comments about it and the threads they're on if you're in or interested in this stock but tldr: biotechs (and most small pharma) are a different beast, revenue/earnings don't matter, and rumors of a major pharma buyout make all of it even more unintelligible.

Based on my research with Splunk (the product), I saw a small dip the day after a quarterly earnings call.

this time, is different.  The last 2 months, they have had massive stock growth based on their flagship prostate cancer treatment product w/ Cesium as well as an annual medical conference.

1006,DD," Really depends on how you want to exit.  

Personally, I do a x% of gains and then wait for any news or catalyst that would indicate to hold or unload.  Their Q2 earnings today should be, IMO, a catalyst to buy more on the dip tomorrow.  

I ran their last 1 year of stock data through Splunk and correlated that to the dates of their announcements on their website.  I used a bit of ML and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to determine a sentiment score - higher the number, the more positive it is.  Unfortunately, the text is always a neutral score of 50 (0, lowest, 100, highest).  

By plotting just their earnings call dates against their stock data, there is a 10 to 20% dip in early morning trading the day after, but it recovers and there is a steady rise for the week.

Today was a good example, finally some good movement, and they use that to instantly do a stock offering, they did the same 3 months ago, 6 months ago, and 9 months ago. At some point you're left wondering who's buying, none of those institutional investors who bought 3, 6 and 9 months ago have gotten value for their investments.

1024,BXRX," I agree with you, just explaining that it is high risk, even with the product, since they have done this offering so many times in the last year.

Initially I believed the whole ""wrecked during the pandemic selloff"", but now I'm certain it is management that is to blame. As an example: the sales force they hired when everyone else was laying off people in Spring 2020 (two months into the pandemic), which generated sales equal to 0.25% of their salary before they had to fire them again, before the company ran out of money. BXRX then had to do another offering round to get fresh cash, and so on and so on.

At some point hopefully they'll fix the managerial issues, ~$50 million in management costs is insane compared to sales, market cap or research expenditures of BXRX, and when that day comes, even if it might be several offerings from now it will go flying, its just a case of ""is it the current shareholders that will see any of that?"". Its not certain either way, but I strongly believe that if we wait until all the smart money is in, then it's to late to get good gains. I believe Jeremy Irons said it best in the movie 'Margin Call': 

“*That there are three ways to make a living in this business... Be first, be smarter, or cheat. Well I don't cheat, and even though I like to think we have got some pretty smart people in this building of the two remaining options, it sure is a hell of a lot easier to just be first.*” 


I have had this stock for a long while, and averaged down during the last quarter, so the average cost price now is under the current price. Why do I own it? Because it really has potential to go to Pluto, although it is by no means certain, its a gamble and a risky move, and when it's no longer that risky move the smart money will already have entered and the meteoric rise will already have happened, in short: ""*it sure is a hell of a lot easier to just be first*"".",Zeerover-,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lfnl1e/bxrx_lower_float_offerings_done_fda_approved_pain/gmn2o9u/,0.099,0.736,0.165,0.9799

1045,DD," Pretty good DD. In the medical field here and the COVID vaccine is less important and in the long run will not generate much revenue. While live attenuated vaccines have large amounts of the public that aren’t able to take them due to other medical problems, the same ppl who are high risk to develop severe COVID too. I could see it being used in the pediatric population. The COVID skin test is interesting but I’ll have to research more on how they plan to use it for diagnostic uses, for instance with TB skin test it takes 24-48 hours for a response (as it is a delayed hypersensitivity), this is actually currently happening with Moderna’s vaccine but 7-9 days past vaccination. So imma have to see how they think that can be used in the grand scheme of fighting COVID. I’m also confused about cyclobenzapine. That drug was FDA approved decades ago under the brand name Flexeril. It was GREAT as a muscle relaxer. OMG wonderful...until we learned about side effects decades later like addiction, cardiac arrhythmias (prolonged QT for those who want specifics) tolerance, highly sedating, dangerous to drive while taking and can easily influence people’s choices to take advantage of them, falls dizziness I could go on and all...but it did do its job. We stopped using it because we had safer alternatives in the past 2 decades or so. Why would they be using this to treat PTSD, Alzheimer’s (especially because this drug is contraindicated in the elderly due to increased mortality rates much like antipsychotics). The HCL is just the inactive ingredients...the active ingredient is still the same and will still carry the same risk. Last but not least why would a doctor prescribe a rebranding on a 40+ year old drug when you can prescribe the same thing for less than 10 dollars a month without insurance at your local Walmart. I mean the skin test is great and all but that won’t come to fruition for at least 2-3 years assuming it gets fast tracked and EUA. So this company has been on my watch list but I haven’t had a chance to really look into it but based on this I’m now leaning more towards a pass. I’ll still look at it tho.

1046,TNXP," Yeah, my brother is a microbiologist and he explain the concept of the vaccine as being somewhat rudimentary but I will explain it’s value. I think the new patents on the cyclobenzapine was to mitigate the addiction issues from what I have heard. 


I think the main area of potential comes with the fact that the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines simply will not be accessible to 3rd world countries for years from now. I read news reports stating that the world as a whole would not reach heard immunity levels for global eradication until 7 years without the help of smaller firms producing vaccines. So essentially I think the skin tests and vaccines developed by TNXP would likely be used in these markets as opposed to 1st world countries so the point about the moderna vaccine providing the same results as the skin test would also be moot in that scenario. 


I am however a college student trying my best to understand somewhat high level medical and economic principles so it is likely that I may not understand/might be missing something and I truly appreciate your input.

They are saying that in their clinical stage 1 trial a flu vaccine patch was comparable to a traditional intramuscular injection. I can imagine if it even would work for a covid vaccine, the money won't be there for it by the time is would approved for use. Capital is being spent now to get the vaccine distributed, by December it will probably drop as the countries hit hardest should be doing ok only aid groups will be doing what they can to help developing countries with vaccine distribution. If their patch was approved in 2017 this would be a different story but I think they are too late to the game.

1149,GME," So, to understand this, it would be best to explain what ‘shorting’ a stock actually means.  

So, when you trade with a broker, you have the option to buy stock with your own cash, or you can buy on margin, meaning you can borrow money/stocks from a brokerage at a certain price.

To short a stock (seems fishy but it is very common practice with individual investors and HFs alike), you borrow the stock at a certain price then if that product dips, rather than return it to the broker you sell it in the market at the lower price.  Then, you immediately buy the same stock back at the lower rate.  Since you never actually purchased the stock, you would be ahead of what you borrowed.  Then when it is time to settle payment with the broker, whatever the current value is of the stock is what would be owed so the difference is pocketed as profit.

It is a very common day trading practice, and was at the crux of the GME insanity (shorts got burned because investors kept buying instead of selling, causing those who shorted stock to actually owe money to brokers when the time to cover came up).

The fact that there are no more borrowed shorts remaining means that there is high potential for a squeeze.  Several investors with shorts are gonna try to force this price as low as possible then buy back, causing the price to go up.  If we predict when that happens and ride that wave, then anyone investing at a low rate could flip a very large profit with good timing, but it is very risky and often not predictable.  It could happen tomorrow, Friday, next week, next month, etc.  It all depends on a catalyst to force a surge in price.  We are already in the midst of this fluctuation since no shorts are available meaning people are about to sell and rebuy very soon, otherwise they risk loss on the shorted stock.

I wouldn’t mind some confirmation on the chart posted though.  The chart lists “zero borrowed” but I’m just not familiar with the sites metrics and the chart itself doesn’t technically list an value hitting zero.  Maybe Im reading it incorrectly?

Hope this info helps!",Ssj_Vega,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lg7ice/aezs_zero_shares_avaliable_to_short/gmq8dtl/,0.073,0.852,0.075,0.1785

1217,SNDL," Oh for sure, Zom is a good investment, especially long term. But im contemplating if I want to invest in it. Because ever since the wsb gme fiasco a lot of people just see penny stocks as pump and dump/day trade, the mentality has changed. Zom was on the restriction list on Robinhood. You can even get bullied for doing long term investing online, like seriously?

It gonna be hard to invest in that long term when the gains wont be natural, but a scheme. I saw it on the daily discussion on wsb how the train or chance passed now its time to sell/dump the stock. They left gme and amc and applied the scheme to all penny stocks

On the top of my head I saw OGCN, SNDL and Zom. This place soon turn to wsb for penny stocks. So its gonna be hard to determine if its natural growth when new people join and just follow the wave.
