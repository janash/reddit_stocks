16,EOD," Herborium Group Inc (HBRM) it’s now trading at $0.00295 as of EOD Friday. 
One of my coworkers *thinks* they have the potential to increase price through a merger with a Canadian company that trades higher. This appears to be the article he was referring to: [Herborium Group (OTC:HBRM) $0.30 run up with possible TRYP Therapeutics merger](https://www.google.com/amp/s/moneymidnight.com/2021/01/herborium-group-otchbrm-0-30-run-up-with-possible-tryp-therapeutics-merger/amp/). It is an older article from January though so there’s always the chance we’re chasing garbage. 
I bought the 3 shares for a penny just as a reminder but will probably throw a $100 or so at it just to see what happens in the long term.

41,DD," Doctor here, just going to chime in to correct some major misconceptions. What exactly is your healthcare experience? I'm just going to point out one or two major issues and I'll leave the rest for a later day. 

>Product effectiveness does not need to be significantly better, only needs to show a statistical difference and be just as safe as current alternatives in order to be brought to market

remember that you said this, okay?

>During the trail Mino-Lok significantly outperformed the standard of care; Mino-Lok had a 0% rate of complication vs the 18% rate of remove and replace, 0% rate of relapse for CLABSI vs the 5% rate of remove and replace

so did you actually read the trial, or just CTXR's headlines regarding the results of the trial? If you read the trial, you will know that they **failed to prove statistical signifiance** in any of those measures. They used raw data without statistical indicators.

So, no, these are not shoe-in products for FDA approval. Based on the available data, they have yet to show statistical significance that this is in any way better than the current standard of care. 

>can cost anywhere from $46,000-$65,000 each time it occurs, the cost comes from the cost of removing and replacing the CVC as well as the cost associated with treating the bloodstream infection caused by the line

this is why you have to think before you blindly read a news article. This is a device used to treat CLABSI, correct? So the cost of treating the bloodstream infection will still apply to the device. In fact, all of the costs will apply to the device. However, you want to compare properly? CVC kit costs $29, the Mino-Lok costs $1,400. That is the actual only difference between the two. In both cases the patient will need systemic antibiotics and increased duration of ICU/hospital stay.

48,CTXR," I'm in CTXR a bit and hope it goes up, but we also have to be realistic here. Mino-Lok is pretty limited use. Normally, catheters can just be replaced instead of sanitized, and is a common, existing practice that works. Doctors will continue to do this, rather than using some new and expensive method to do so. The only time Mino-Lok will truly help is when they can't remove the catheter safely for some reason, which does happen from time to time, but not that often.

Personally, because of it's limited use, I'm probably going to tap out after making a bit of profit on Mino-Lok's P3 success (I hope), rather than attempting to diamond hands it up to a billion dollar valuation.",nyxian-luna,9,/r/pennystocks/comments/lum3hr/citius_pharmaceuticals_ctxr_the_next_billion/gp7ardo/,0.033,0.759,0.208,0.9804

68,ANY," This past week has been rough, but using a certain method, you can always take advantage of such days to actually turn a profit or lose very little. If you have a diversified portfolio, no one stock can tank your account. But some days, most stocks can be down, such as yesterday when the first 3-4 hours of trading, about 90% of penny stocks were in the red, some VERY red taking losses of 40-70%. If you manage your risk well with each stock you pick, and don't buy big on stocks that have already gone up big, you can take advantage of fluctuations if you buy on big dips and sell multiple times for 10-20% gains throughout a given day. These small flips add up over the course of the day and can cover much or all (or more) of your losses. Then when a day comes where only 40-60% of stocks are in the red, you can make some good money using these techniques. The key is trading multiple stocks, learning how they trade by trading them every day, watching them closely, and constatnly scanning for opportunities in stocks created by volatility. Having a broker that allows you to trade OTC Markets stocks for $0 - $5 per trade will really help to boost your profits and make you more confident to trade smaller and more frequently. Given how this last week went, I'd say it's a safe prediction that the market is starting to decline, at least for OTC stocks, as they did the past 3 or 4 years during the first quarter and into the summer. I believe many pennies have been heavily overbought and the big correction has started. However we should still see plenty of good days to come, hopefully not too far and few between the red ones.

&#x200B;

Some pro tips for penny stock trading:

&#x200B;

\- For every stock you pick, you must be able to afford to buy more of that stock if it dips down lower than you think. So start small if the stock has already been bought up with a higher price.

\- Instead of a stop loss, just keep buying shares at lower prices if there hasn't been any bad news regarding the stock and it's just dipping for no reason other than profit taking. When it bounces back up, try to sell only half your shares when you think it's going to come back down. Never sell all of your shares, because often you will be wrong and that stock will return to your original buy price and even go much higher.

\- Pick stocks based on how they trade, and that provide a sense of safety based on something currently happening or coming in regards to the stock. Boring stocks with no upcoming catalysts do not move much.

\- If you want to be a serious trader, buy a computer with at least a 4-monitor array - One for charts, one for account and positions (like above image), one for executions/orders/L2/watch list, and one for a web browser. Personally, I use a 6 monitor setup, an additional screen for news and second watch list, etc.

\- Lock in profits every day (realize gains). If you sell for a profit, don't sell all your shares! You may be wrong and the stock could go higher! This will happen sometimes making you more money, other times you will be correct, the stock will go lower, and you can buy back shares and make money again every time it goes back up. This is realizing gains and you can do this with ANY volatile stock.",x100xPercentxTrade,94,/r/pennystocks/comments/lu6m9p/my_day_trading_strategy_protects_my_account_from/gp4gou1/,0.075,0.786,0.14,0.9926

83,DD," I'm not a seasoned investor but any means, but I have been in the brewing business for almost a decade now. At least in New England, new breweries will almost always purchase Chinese made brewing equipment. 

I recently got a quote on a 3 vessel, 10 barrel brewhouse that cost less than a top tier Kia sedan.

I feel a vast majority of new breweries opening in the US are started by home brewers or inexperienced entrepreneurs who want to cash in on a market they think isn't oversaturated. Which it is. Very rarely do you see a brewery start to break ground with a sizeable amount of capital, well funded etc. Those are the type of people who are going to be buying american made brewing equipment.

Out of the 34 customers you questioned, did you ask them what size brewhouse they have, what their fermentation capacity is, what kind of auxiliary equipment they purchased or plan on purchasing (example: canning equipment, keg cleaning equipment) and what their current and or projected barrels per year output, as well as their sales model (example: onsite sales only, 70/30 distro/onsite, hyperlocal or regional distro)

Just to give you an real world example. I work for a brewery that opened 11 years ago. About 7 years ago they purchased new chinese made equipment. They purchased mid to large scale equipment. With this gear I could output 10k barrels a year go or take. That's a fairly large output. We have only been running under 2k barrels per year. This equipment cost upwards of 1 million new.

I have good friends that have been running a brewery the same amount of time. They consistently output 1k barrels a year or under, on repurposed dairy equipment. I'm involved in their plan to expand and they're the ones looking into the chinese made brewhouse that costs what a nice Kia costs. 

The beer business is a cruel mistress. I've been looking into investing in some beer related stocks, so I'm happy to read this DD. I'm just attempting to help from my viewpoint.

 In the future Drone Delivery Canada will possibly offer extremely heavy cargo drones for shipping containers and mining sites when regulatory approval catches up.

At a first glance, it looks super boring. Whatever they sell to the studios is routers and whatnot. The  augmented reality thing, might be something to look for. But, what would it make this company boom in a market where we have Oculus, Samsung, FaceBook, etc..?

Interested in knowing more. Thanks!

PS You left out the most important metric LENGTH OF STAY REDUCTION presented in the paper which shows about 1 in 2000 chance it was a random occurence, far better than any 95% probability (99.4% and 99.6% confident in the results). I will paste it here for you, try to comprehend this time:

""The median time in hospital was similarly analyzed by Cox proportional hazards model. A 10 day median difference in time to hospital length of stay was seen in all HFNC participants (P=.006) and a 13 day difference was seen in those treated in tertiary care centers (P=.004).

156,ALL," Getting personal and defensive like that already shows your blind love for this stock tbh. But since you only look at numbers and not context, let me clarify it for you.

''A 10 day median difference in time to hospital length of stay was seen in all HFNC participants (P=.006) and a 13 day difference was seen in those treated in tertiary care centers (P=.004). "" 

Where does this say there's a difference between the placebo and the experimental group? This is a difference in length of duration between patients who were TREATED DIFFERENTLY (high flow nasal cannula and tertiary care centers) and has nothing to do with the drug itself! Note that they say ALL HFNC participants and tertiary centers and not experimental/placebo HFCN/tertiary center participants. They measure this to correct variations in recovery between different treatments which may affect your results. 

This is the most important data the FDA will look at: overall difference in hospital durations between EXPERIMENTAL group and PLACEBO, which has a laughable p-value of 0.08. Are you an expert in statistics or responsible for EUA approvals? You might as well explain this then: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6169785/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6169785/)

157,AM," Well good thing they showed a p value of 0.004 for a median 10 day reduction in length of stay. That is far better than a 0.05 probability. It is also the basis for which Remdisivar was granted a EUA. They just have published a paper showing a better reduction with a higher degree of certainty -- you don't think that is of any significance huh? Also, EUA's are granted upon ""Safe and may be effective"" criteria.

The risky bit is that Suncor is mostly tar sands. That’s very low quality oil that is expensive to extract and sells at a discount. So the oil price has to go higher for them to turn a good profit, and the money machine shuts off more quickly when oil prices dip. If OPEC ramps production to hurt US fracking, tar sands will take the hit faster and harder.

The only thing that worries me is they haven't released any PR since that shareholder meeting last summer.

I don’t want to pass myself off as someone who is more researched or well read than I am, my research came from google, where I simply looked to find anything that stands out to me. One thing I have found ( just from basic internet searches) is that PSYK ETF weighs SEEL stock heaviest among all its holdings at over 11%. That and it’s recent dip, which I attribute to the natural eb and flow of the market is making me consider buying. However, I’m going to wait to make sure it has bottomed out first.

295,ONE," Ok listen up
Firstly seems like you’re new, don’t think you can jump in and make easy money.
Trading is an art that you have to master, don’t be discouraged if you lose money because you will- so manage your risk - use 1% of your capital per trade. Make ONE/TWO trades per day don’t force trades and don’t over trade, if you can’t find a setup then simply walk away and come back the next day. I don’t trade anymore because I’m too busy for it but you need a profitable strategy, it’s not as simple as I’m buying this with 20% target and 5% stop loss. LOOK LEFT if the stock has done something in the past it’s likely to repeat itself... will it always repeat itself? Absolutely not buttttt as long as you play the odds you will end up profitable. Don’t think I need to make 5% on every trade think where do I think this price may have some troubles getting past and take 80% at that level and let the rest run.
Yours sincerely 
Random guy from the internet
