1,GME,"Disclaimer: This is not investment advice. Do your own research.

A short squeeze on GME now has a very high probability of materializing. Due to naked shorting and greed (short interest above 100%), institutional shorts are trapped. The only way to solve this will be with a direct deal with GME board. In my view, they will ask for 2x-10x current price. This will give them enough funds to do important M&A and turnaround the company. Ryan is a very smart billionaire. They are not reaching to the media (e.g. Cramer) until the shorts realize they have no way out, but pay 10B-40B in a 10%-30% share offering.

59,GME,"No, this isn’t really the valuation of this stock. What’s happening here with GME is a short squeeze.

So you need to understand what “shorting” means. Most people understand the stock market as “buy low, sell high.” Shorting is the opposite of that in a way. When you short a stock, you expect the stock price to decline. You are borrowing the stock, and you promise to pay back that stock in the future. If you’re correct, and the stock you shorted kept declining in price, then you made money because you paid back at lower price than when you borrowed. If you guessed wrong, and the stock you shorted ended up doing well, then you lost money, because you’re paying back at higher than the price you borrowed it at. The principle is “sell high, buy low” basically.

GME happens to be a declining business, and GME is the single most shorted stock currently. With recent news of Ryan Cohen joining GME, people are thinking he will turn the company around, and they started buying GME stock. This was the catalyst for the short squeeze.

A short squeeze happens when a stock that was shorted a lot (GME) goes up in price quickly (Ryan Cohen news) and short sellers are panicking to buy the stock because they need to pay it back. This pushes the price up even further, thus making other short sellers having to buy back the stock at an even higher price, which pushes the stock price higher and higher. Repeat the process until all short positions are covered. 

It’s a supply-demand case. There are strong demand to buy GME stock (short sellers have to buy it back to pay what they borrowed), but little supply (people who own GME stock refusing to sell or keep buying because they understand how to short squeeze). It’s a losing battle for the people who shorted the stock, because they are paying interest on what they borrowed, so they are bleeding money waiting for GME price to drop. As long as the GME stock owners won’t budge and keep holding simply by sitting on their shares, GME price will go up, because short sellers are obligated to buy back GME stock eventually, even at a ridiculous price. With high demand and low supply, the sellers are in control and they can set the price much much MUCH higher than the stock is worth. They are squeezing short sellers dry. 

If you want to buy GME now and take advantage of the short squeeze, do some more research first because you need to know when to exit. If you are interested in buying GME long term, wait until the short squeeze is over. Once all short positions are covered, people will sell and take profit, which will crash the stock price to its appropriate evaluation.

102,SP,"I’m certainly no expert but will give it a shot.

When you short shares you’ve borrowed shares and then sold them. In order to buy back later at a lower price and return the shares to the original owner and you bank the difference.

But this means you have a commitment you eventually need to resolve with the party you borrowed the shares from. Now if the SP started to go down after you shorted, the other party is not going to be worried about your commitment because you’re ahead. But if the stock moves upwards, you’re now going to be paying money in order to close out the position.

So as the stock goes higher and your liability increases, there is more risk for lending party that you won’t be able to cover your costs so they will require interest or margin based on the amount you are currently behind (this part someone else can give better details on, and correct me). If the stock continues to rise the margin calls the lender requires you to pay become higher and higher and in many cases I believe there is a limit to what liability they will allow you to owe before they require you to close out the position.

So a short squeeze is when people have identified some large short positions and they attempt to push the price up causing these margins/liabilities on the shorters side to increase to unmanageable levels where they will have to close out their positions as they can’t afford the margin call or they have reached their liability limits.

(Current Assets:  \~$500K in Fidelity, \~$50K in Vanguard, \~$8K in a non retirement 'funmoney' TDA account)

**Fidelity**:

Pros:  The people I have talked to on the phone are nice.   They have a desktop client, even if it looks from the 80s.  Actual in-person location, even if I have never used one.  

Cons:  Cannot set (sell) limit orders at greater than 50% last price\*.  Cannot use funds in account to sell cash secured puts for a lower entry.    
\* This is really irking me, because during the day I am at work, not on my IRA.  I want to be able to set it and forget it.

**Vanguard:**

Pros:  I love that they are investor owned. 

Cons:  Egads that website for making trades is horrible!   (Haven't played with it too much)

**TDA**:  

Pros:  ThinkorSwim - I am liking the client, the ability to set conditional & chained orders, and the mobile apps as well.  

Cons:  fees?  (haven't found too many, other than the normal delays in waiting for cash to settle)

It's due to the feeling of being left behind, or FOMO. When you make lots of money, you don't care about the college kids gambling their few thousand bucks away making 1000%, because despite that you're still ahead. I saved over a quarter of a million of my income and invested it all into index funds last year, and that's not counting my portfolio gains. A kid with a 20k portfolio would have to 25x their money last year to just keep up with my savings, so none of this GME stuff impresses me. But when you're a college kid making 15k a year with a part-time job, and you see your buddies making 10x on their stimulus checks, you'll feel FOMO, even if it's only a measly 12k lol.",0.067,0.818,0.115,0.7615
211,GME,"The current path you are on leads to inevitable financial ruin.  You describe yourself as risk averse, but you have been selling options and now you've put all of your money in a single recently IPO'ed company.  By any sensible standard of risk, you are accelerating toward the edge of a cliff with the foot on the gas.

The reason why it doesn't feel like you're taking risk is that you were still learning the alphabet the last time there was a real bear market.  (No, last March doesn't count.)  I hope the next one comes soon, because it's probably going to wipe you out and it's better if you learn the lesson young.

If you want your money to survive a little longer than that, diversify.  Put the bulk of your money in index funds, and if you want to learn about investing then reserve 10% of your portfolio for your own moves.  But for the love of god, learn how to measure the risk of a portfolio so that you understand why not to put all your money in a single stock.

Also, there are much better ways to take risk than stock picking.  Investing in the S&P 500 with margin has a positive expected value if you start young, even factoring in the probability of getting wiped out.  There are high risk options strategies with positive expected values as well, but they require a bigger bankroll.

In short, the only FOMO you should have is for not getting the practically guaranteed millions you can make off of the basic market premium starting your age.  I'm in GME, and yeah I guess it's kind of fun - but I'm donating all of the gains to charity.

Sorry to be blunt, but it's just true.

There's a scene in one of the old Austin Powers movies where he's playing blackjack and decides to stand with a 5 and a 2 or something.  When told he should probably hit he replies ""I like to live dangerously"".  Owning only one stock is the investing equivalent of this.

The problem is that there are very few profitable investment theses that apply to only one company.  If you write down your precise argument for why RKT is the best possible stock, the one of two things will happen.  Either you will write down something too specific ""mortgage companies founded in Detroit in 1985"", in which case your thesis is untestable and you're just guessing.

Otherwise you'll write down a testable argument, and you'll find that it applies to 10 other companies.

300,ATH,"Yes, most likely everything will eventually overheat and come down to some level, but all signs and market patterns point to growth for another 8 months, possibly longer. Thats a nice window of opportunity.

For example, ETH is expected to make an 80% move in the coming weeks, and 400% over the bull run from here to $5k. Some argue to $10k.

BTC another 300% from here to $100k, some argue $288k.

No guarantees, of course, but if $1400 ETH is an ATH, but it is going to $5k b4 the crash, then ATH is not a real top. Just a local top, which doesn't matter unless you are selling tomorrow. Same idea on BTC.

Don't buy some smallcap coins just because the top tier coins are at ATH levels. Pair the ATH consideration with where we are in the market cycle (early to mid). We have only seen a minority of the gains to be had in this run.

302,VXUS,">VOO

I'd look at VTI instead. Fully contains VOO as the majority of the weighed holdings and gives coverage of the US extended market.

>or VXUS

""And"" not ""or"". VTI/VOO are US only, VXUS does not cover the US. VTI + VXUS would give you coverage of most of the stocks around the world.  VT would be the ""or"" option, it would effectively be VTI + VXUS combined into one fund.

>I think they beat the overall market

They may have recently, but will they continue to do so forever (at least as far as you're concerned)? Winners don't stay winners forever, they rotate. Even huge companies can fall. Compare the top 10 holdings of S&P 500 funds from 1980 to today's (https://etfdb.com/history-of-the-s-and-p-500/ gives from 1980-2013, the pages for VTI/VOO show the modern top 10).",0.023,0.883,0.094,0.845
303,AMZN,"No. It used to be the case, when you had to pay $19.95 to enter or exit a stock. You had to buy enough to overcome those high transaction costs.
