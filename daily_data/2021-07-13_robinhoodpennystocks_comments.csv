19,RH," I did a bit of that toward the end, and while it slowly crept upward over the weeks I realized that's what I have a fairly decent sized 401k for and turned around and dumped all the remaining play money I had in RH into one or two tickers. Those aren't doing so well this week of course, so I'm just numb enough to not give a crap for a while and so rarely open it save to add a bit here and there to DCA. 

The real trick is not to invest more than you're willing to lose. I didn't, and for that I'm incredibly thankful. There have been times I was up over 60% of my initial 'investment' and watched it all drain back down and further into losses. Kinda get numb after a while! haha.
