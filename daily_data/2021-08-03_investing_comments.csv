0,TV," This probably won't ""kill"" the industry, but it's good to remind people in the west that all entertainment industry in China (TV, movie, games, publishing, social media) are walking a fine line, and subject to every-changing regulatory risk from the CCP.

A few years back, many finished TV drama cannot air just because the party doesn't like their subject (drama about ancient emperor's harem), and the companies are forced to absorb the loss. This is just one example. People need to know the risk before invest in China's entertainment industry.

Edit: It's important to note, entertainment or any ""content"" related industry subject to more scrutiny from the party compared to other things such as food or manufacturing.

9,FAST," >How does this help them stay in power?

Younger Chinese have started a movement where they engage in what they call 'lying down.' The idea is that because the economy is becoming such that it's harder and harder for normal people to get ahead, younger people are essentially giving up and playing video games as a form of escapism.

&#x200B;

If you want the answer to your question, just think about it from the point of view of the CCP. Everything has an opportunity cost. We also need to remember that the CCP (while grotesque, evil, and despicable) is, more often than not, logical in its attempts to maintain power. This is a state that literally spends more money controlling its own populace than it does on its military, so we can assume micro-managing their populace is *very* important to them for the stability of the regime. These regulatory moves are very telling. Apparently getting a fire lit under the younger generation is more important than potentially a trillion dollars--to the CCP anyway. It might not make sense on the surface, but if you keep in mind the fact that China has one of the worst (worse than Korea or Japan or western Europe) demographical problems on earth, it starts to make a little more sense. They have younger people that are working less, getting married less, having fewer babies, etc., etc. It is an existential crisis for China as they are projected to *rapidly* decline in population. Add to the mix that there are many millions of soon-to-be retirees and the sheer numbers of so many dying at once with so few to care for them, let alone *replace* them is going to be catastrophic. Not to mention the problem of having more men than women... (All of these problems stem from the one-child policy, and the fact that they've changed the policy is not working, as their decades of propaganda was so effective that they've engrained '1 child', if that, into the psyche of the people.) What're one trillion dollars if you can't maintain your regime? If you're China and you want to be ready for war, financing it is not the problem right now. It's ensuring your country's populace doesn't fall off a cliff as far as procreation goes. (I realize the population is massive, but it won't be for long if something doesn't change, and FAST. Especially with their rival India projected to continue to increase.)

12,ALL," Most countries spend more money on internal security than their military. This is normal. The US is the outlier here, as it needs to constantly invade other countries, which is expensive.

The EU on average spends more on domestic security relative to military than China does.

* [EU spending on public order and safety](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Government_expenditure_on_public_order_and_safety
): 1.7% of GDP.
* [EU spending defence](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Government_expenditure_on_defence
): 1.2% of GDP.

The idea that a country *should* be spending more on external military than internal security- which covers policing, prisons, the court system, all of that- is a very particularly American idea. And it's nuts.

Not trying to argue China is blameless here, it's an authoritarian state. No argument there. Just that this specific soundbite makes little sense.

EDIT: as post was locked, my reply to you here:

This allegation is sort of a meme which has its root with usual anti-China mob (Adrian Zenz) who found this number in the government reporting and decided to spin it as if the number was just ""repressing internal dissidents"", but as far as I can see it's not, it is the general internal security budget, same as any other country.

Zenz doesn't provide any additional justification that this number is specifically for internal repression, and that all the regular (policing, courts, prisons) is somewhere else. He just says it is. Or rather, *insinuates* that's what it is. Because he knows it's not just that, and even in other articles says as much. But the soundbite is, this is all ""internal dissident repression"" spending. And there is so much concerted anti-China sentiment in the West at the moment, the media just runs with this uncritically and the whole thing gets repeated.

I went through the Chinese government budget, and the number matched what what they were saying was the amount relative to military spending, but it was that category that includes police, courts, prisons, etc. There wasn't another category that stuff would have gone under.

This whole thing is spin.

None of this is to justify China or its government or its internal handling of dissidents. I don't agree with any of that. It's a totalitarian state with severe human rights issues. I'm certainly not saying there is no repression, of course there is repression. I'm not saying that isn't happening. And I'm sure some of the stuff done with this money is straight up repression. But it's also covering the ""regular"" police, courts, prisons, public safety, etc. This specific meme is just bullshit propaganda.

You can have very nasty regimes (Saddam's Iraq comes to mind) and they are genuinely bad and horrendous people. But that still doesn't mean all the propaganda you hear about them is true- like the babies being turfed out of the incubators, or for that matter the WMDs, all of which was again- bullshit propaganda to justify US intervention.

>This does not include prisons, by the way. 

This is from Adrian Zenz himself, even he acknowledges it does include exactly that:

>Domestic security budgets on all regional levels typically contain the following sub-categories: People’s Armed Police (PAP, 武装警察), the public security organs (公安机关) which are administered by the Ministry of Public Security (国家公安部), **the court system** (法院系统), **the judicial system** (司法系统) which includes **the prison system** (监狱系统), **the prosecutorial system** (检察院系统), state security (国家安全) which is administered by the Ministry of State Security (MSS; 国家安全部), and the expenditures of the National Administration for the Protection of State Secrets (NAPSS; 国家保密局), the Chinese equivalent of the American National security Agency (NSA).

31,ACH," Nope, most banks have online bill pay, as far as I'm aware they mostly print out a paper check and mail it on your behalf and there's no actual guarantee when it arrives. I think that many bigger companies accept direct ach transfer through online bill pay. But the ACH system is ancient and only runs during banking hours and not weekends. If you need to pay something immediately then you can use a debit/credit card which oftentimes incurs a fee if you're paying something like a utility bill or the government. Some companies offer to do auto bill pay if you give them your bank account details and authorize them to withdraw from your account directly, which imo is dangerous if your details get leaked or someone makes a mistake. You can of course still use paper checks to pay people. If you both have a Chase Bank account I think you can send people money through some kind of system they have but not too other banks. Also most us banks don't have an international transfer number only the big banks have one, so if you want to receive an international wire transfer then you need to set up an account with one of those.",whathaveyoudoneson,1,/r/investing/comments/oww17h/bank_of_america_files_shelf_to_offer_up_to_123/h7lnbc6/,0.089,0.865,0.046,-0.7995

There is a big risk business travel never again picks up, which drives margins for a majority of airlines.  There are also emerging ESG risks around jets and jet fuel -- I don't think it realistic that the jet would disappear, but we may see countries taxing and generally discouraging their use in the next few years.

Plus, just about every black swan event in modern history has wrecked airlines.  It's almost comical.  Terrorist attack?  RIP airlines.  Housing crash?  RIP airlines.  New virus?

Even in the current primary use case w/travel I think it'll be compelling given that it's likely that the screening process isn't going to get easier anytime soon and Clear allows things like bypassing quarantine in Hawaii (https://www.clearme.com/hawaii.) It's a smaller holding although I'm adding lately. and we'll see if it gets promoted from a smaller holding in the months ahead. 

As for Clear and their health pass, look at what NYC announced today. Other cities may follow and if things head in that direction, certainly an opportunity for Clear.

""Airlines in general, i and I think a lot of others were anticipating major trans Atlantic and pacific routes would open up""

I'd like to hope that everything opens up and things get better, but really the way that this has been handled and the way that things continue to unfold, I'd rather primarily devote to long-term growth trends (e-comm, payments, etc) and really, the longer this all goes on, IMO the more compelling science plays (TMO, DHR, etc) become - these are companies telling you that they have strong order books into next year and I can't imagine that science doesn't see significant ""so that this doesn't happen again"" spending in the years ahead given this crisis - whether it ever ends or not.

The ""re-opening"" stuff feels as if it's *partly* working and I think people really got way ahead of themselves in thinking that things would just rebound in a straight line. People are traveling but they're traveling to resorts and natural areas and less to major cities. They're camping, etc. Business travel has been improving somewhat but has encountered a setback again and I don't really see international travel coming back for a while.

Airports have always seemed like a more appealing business than airlines because it's just fees for everyone. Fees for the airlines (landing fees), fees for the passengers (parking, etc) and retail real estate that has a captive audience waiting for planes, plus high-traffic ad space.  Many, many (many, many) airlines have come and gone bankrupt over the years while airports have pretty much stayed the same and cities. Certainly economically sensitive and then some, but business has more of a moat than airlines imo.",dvdmovie1,2,/r/investing/comments/owwhup/are_the_airlines_severely_undervalued/h7l93j2/,0.028,0.795,0.178,0.9968

77,ATH," > Ok, this is getting a bit out of hand. A constant barrage of bearish news coming out of China after some stabilizing that happened at the end of last week. Not sure what the endgame here is for China or the CCP. On one hand, it makes no sense for them to lose the confidence of foreign investors with moves like this. Are they pushing the boundaries of patience of investors? Or is this a deliberate attempt to crackdown on each sector one by one?

I get what you mean. It looks like China looks at their capital markets and investors differently than the US. In the US there is a tonne of attention and news relating to the stock market/investors and such. Any decision made by the government or the Fed, the news looks at the news to see what ""the market"" thinks of the decision. It wouldn't surprise me if it influences decisions made by policy makers. I remember Donald Trump as President would refer to the stock market a lot, saying it's reach ATH at some point under his tenure. 

In China, the CCP seem to not give a heck about the stock market. As in, if their decisions hurt the stock market. They care about the social and political areas more. Assuming they're doing things by the book, it's not really a bad thing because with BABA, and Tencent, they went after monopolistic practices regarding letting customers pay with the competitors payment service. The $2.5B fine on Alibaba last year was for monopolistic practices that hurt merchants such as, forcing them to sell exclusively on one platform. The Private Tutoring companies that were hurt badly last week was to reduce costs for students. They went after Didi because of data protection issues, I believe (correct me if I'm wrong). 

Other than the Private Tutoring companies, these don't seem so unfair, assuming these fines were made fairly and ""by the book"". I can't imagine the US hitting their big companies so quickly and easily for these monopolistic practices. Really, it would be years of court dates, then a small fine. 

It's interesting to see 2 superpowers approaching tech companies so differently. Will be interesting to see how this proceeds.",himynameis_,1,/r/investing/comments/owxhxu/china_regulator_to_probe_auto_chip_distributors/h7lo3k7/,0.069,0.84,0.091,0.786

108,AAPL," I actually think that Square is a pretty interesting company. But by what metric are you using to compare Square's growth to the companies that I mentioned?

Square transaction payment volume is about $120Bn...

Fiserv transaction payment volume is over $2.6 trillion...

FIS transaction payment volume is over $1,7 trillion...

132,TD," Hi all, so my mother recently passed away and left me $100k and a paid off house, half of which my sister owns, and I'd like to know what to do with this money.   

I'm 44 years old, and I live in the US. I make $15/hr, debt free, with relatively small expenses \~$1,500 month, and I have zero money invested in stocks or a retirement account. I've taken the first step of opening a ROTH IRA with TD Ameritrade, since my employer doesn't offer a 401(k), and I plan on maxing it out with $6,000. I also have an individual account, for which I want to invest the remainder of my money, but I'm not sure if I should seek out a financial planner to help me choose the type of investments to make or just talk to a consultant from TD Ameritrade.

Being that I'm late in the game, I'd say my risk tolerance is on the higher side for someone my age, and I'm not afraid to take some risks. My goal is to save up enough money to retire comfortably 20-25 years from now. I do want to start my own business in the near future so I can increase my income, but I have no idea what kind of business I want to start, or how much of my savings I want to risk on a startup. I also plan on converting my garage into a ADU, so I'll be applying for a home equity loan to pay for construction costs.

Any advice you can give me will be highly appreciate.

133,CD," Okay, so glad you've done well to this point. You worded your comment well so you'll likely get a few more responses in better detail than I can provide. I'll try to be concise:

1. Indexes (ETFS) are great for your situation where you don't understand markets entirely. I recommend either S&P 500 indexes, or total market like VTI.
   1. These two are relatively safe investments because the US population is growing, and productivity in the US is still increasing, leading to long term stock market gains.
2. REIT's are a fine thing to invest in, they just complicate your taxes. I avoid them to keep my life simpler (saves roughly 20 hours a year for losing maybe $40 in gains on 10K investment. I.e. it's not worth investing in them until you have like 50K+ to put in them.
3. As for judging stocks and investments, you'll want to start with the FAQ on the right side of this page and my normal response to that question: [General advice on investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ngv55o/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gyvq1pg?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
4. You have a 4 year time horizon, so I assume you're thinking down payment on house, car, or paying for an event like a wedding or moving, etc. That's less time than most your age for an investment, so I would stay away from risky investments at this point. Risky investments are crypto, most individual stocks, high yield bonds, and yes, REITS.
5. My exact recommendation would be put 100% of the funds into VTI (total market etf) for 2 years. At the 2 year mark, pull 20% of the funds out into a  2-year Certificate of Deposit (CD) at a bank. Then at 1 year, pull another 30% out into a 1 year CD. and continue to draw out the remaining 50% over the course of that year, depending on your exact date you need the cash.
   1. The reason I recommend this strategy is it allows you to avoid trying to pull everything out at a bad time in the stock market. If the market is UP a lot, it's a good time to pull out into the CD. If the market is DOWN a lot, It's a good time to wait to transfer.",exe_virus,2,/r/investing/comments/owzibv/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h7jgri9/,0.041,0.827,0.132,0.9848
