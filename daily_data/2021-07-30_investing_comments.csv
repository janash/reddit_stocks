14,BNTX," So Moderna has half the profit per dose despite getting more free money for development? Moderna also has booster and children's studies... I think BioNTech/Pfizer are pretty consistently winning the race to the next thing and BioNTech is relatively undervalued so I have more invested there, but the difference is quite small. Moderna seems more aggressive about future gene editing applications which is important to me. If one of them sold the covid and future influenza vax business and focused on the future I'd move all my investment there.

As it is there's the likely upside for the future of the pandemic from continued efficacy against moderate or severe covid-19 -- which is a downside for future vaccine and booster sales if it holds up. I'd been assuming robust booster sales for many adults in Europe and USA this winter and perhaps it will only be for the elderly, if at all, like in Israel now. So as long as they're banking on a covid market that's uncertain and will have more firms entering this year I'm pulling back a little bit. imo the future might look more like seasonal influenza vaccination but with less coverage needed because of lower diversity of strains to vaccinate against... dunno if the 6B doses MRNA and BNTX plan to make in 2022 will have buyers, but confident they'll both be leaders in the next generations of mRNA vaccines and therapies.",coliguy,1,/r/investing/comments/ouj7jl/global_coronavirus_covid19_vaccine_market/h74izm0/,0.071,0.83,0.099,0.7993

19,MS," MS is a growth tech company with incredible margins, that is also well balanced and diversified to the point that they can basically be considered a tech etf on their own. 

Seriously, they do pretty much everything - hardware, retail and enterprise software, operating systems, social media, ai, gaming, and cloud computing 

No other company is as complete a package as MS imo. All the other mega tech companies might also be diversified on paper, but in practice companies like apple, google, facebook, and amazon make the vast majority of their money from one, maybe two things. So while they might be doing really well, they do have more risk associated with them currently than MS

40,MSFT," Adding some more oil to this fire. I think market is also pricing [SWOT](https://wordstream-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/styles/simple_image/public/images/swot-analysis-header1.png?9qhkGEQVMX2Zv5QGkYamvDXW3t1aGWzC&itok=DBCeVBGl) Most notably, S and T if we're talking about MSFT v FB. 

One S that the the rest of the AAAMs have that F doesn't really have is multi-market diversification. Google isn't just google searches. They do cloud services, youtube, data analytics, AI, had andriod, and owns the playstore etcetc. Amazon doesn't just sell stuff. They deliver, they offer credit, the do advertising, they offer business services, own wholefoods, are the big fish in cloud, going into delivery, etcetc. Apple does a range of products, offers services, offers subscriptions, is getting into chips, etcetc. MSFT does top-bottom consumer and business tech, hardware and software, offers biz services, engages in cloud, has the Xbox and gaming division, skype, linkedin, bing, etcetc. It's only FB that is mostly advertising centric where they are indeed dominant but it's also only [FB that hasn't shown *to be able to expand into and disrupt* other industries/sectors like the rest of the AAAMs and thus don't have a bunch of other businesses to fall back on if they lose advertising superiority.](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VC_Tech-Giant-Billions_2020_V5.jpg)

The T part is another major factor. Google/Amazon/Apple/Microsoft all have a top bottom distribution with tech. Google has not only the pixel but has control over the android system and playstore. Ditto with Apple except with all their hardware and apple ecosystem. Ditto with MSFT but with more emphasis with computers. Ditto with Amazon and their fire products. It's ONLY Facebook that doesn't really have that outside of the Oculus which hasn't grown into some big thing. That's precisely Apple's data restriction waging war with Facebook who's trying to fight the appstore in court. GOOG & MSFT might see these AAPL moves and do their own version of that to limit what data FB can collect weakening them further.

74,IRS," I've hit the limits on google, so would like to hear others opinions. I stumbled across this article recently: Strategies to Help Clients Around the Wash Sale Rule | Nasdaq  
TL;DR: within the article is an interesting strategy to capture a loss on common without triggering a wash sale. 1) Sell your stock at a loss 2) buy a long call (triggers wash sale, inherits the basis) 3) Buy back the stock (has its own basis).  
I called up ETrade to confirm they would assign the cost basis to the call, however several ETrade customer service reps told me that ETrade does not consider long or short calls to trigger the wash sale (even if the call is ITM). This seems at odds with various interpretations of the murky IRS guidelines on wash sales. At the end of the day, I will report whatever is in my 1099, but this seems wrong given a call (even OTM) is often considered ""substantially identical.""  
According to ETrade, I should be able to do the following: 1) sell stock at a loss 2) buy a 30 day OTM call to capture any potential upside (no wash sale adjustment) 3) wait 31 days from step 1 and then buy back the stock (avoiding wash sale).  
Anyone have direct experience with either approach above and received 1099s from ETrade that can clear this up for me? Would it be safer to do a different strategy (also outlined in the article): 1) sell the stock 2) sell a 31-day ITM put to lock in a purchase price?",chemicalbilly,1,/r/investing/comments/ouh0z0/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h73ufja/,0.04,0.91,0.05,0.3918

My investment strategy is mainly based on investing in the Vanguard All World ETF (VWRL) and some smaller investments in stocks I like on the side. The issue that I have with VWRL is that due to its broad exposure, it by nature contains companies/industries that I don't support.

Therefore I'm looking for (All World) ETFs that still have an exposure as broad as possible, but that are more socially responsible.

Some that I've found so far:[\- UBS socially responsible all world](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=LU0950674332)[\- Lyxor MSCI World ESG leaders](https://www.morningstar.de/de/etf/snapshot/snapshot.aspx?id=0P0001DBZS&InvestmentType=FE)[\- Ishared MSCI world ESG screened](https://www.morningstar.nl/nl/etf/snapshot/snapshot.aspx?id=0P0001EVTI)[\- Amundi MSCI World SRI (EUR hedged)](https://www.morningstar.be/be/etf/snapshot/snapshot.aspx?id=0P0001LCQX)

Are there any other ETFs that you would recommend looking into? I'm located in the EU, so preferably the funds are in EUR / are hedged EUR. Also generally curious if others are having similar thoughts with regards to socially responsible investing.

78,GFL," Hello, if anybody could help me, I have a notable question.

I’ve met this girl on a dating website, I’m from the USA, she loves in Hong Kong, she speaks very little english, but she writes english a decent amount with the help of a translator.

She had told me that she was looking for a guide while in the U.S. because she is not from the area, that she was here on business, 

I told her that there are guides for hire in areas, and asked her what she does for business. She proceeded to tell me that she invests, and has a team of professionals, and wanted to teach me.

So she told me to download the MetaTrader5 app, and had me start off with 100,000 fake money just to play around with and learn the software which she had sent me a powerpoint to help learn. 

Then after I was done learning, she started making calls to show me what she does, so she’d tell me specific times and say like “buy 35 shares, at 10:45.” So I did, and sold when she said to sell, and she made multiple calls like this and each time I listened to her I profited.

The most noticeable gain that she had called was $19,000(with 35 shares of Gold VS USD)

Note that she only works in that stock, and she had me make an account under her business that she associates with “GFL” or “GFL Capital Limited “ and told me it wouldn’t effect me because it’s a demo account.

I’ve asked her how she is able to make calls like these and make the money so easily, and she said she has a team of professionals that helps her.

She has been telling me that I should save up $2,000 then make a real account, and start investing with real money, and she will call all my shots.

The GFL website where she said to make the real account asks for a bit of personal information, and I don’t know if it’s safe.

My question to this subreddit is if there is any way she could be a scammer, or trying to trick me in any way.",The-Decomposed-Rose,0,/r/investing/comments/ouh0z0/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h73vj1d/,0.02,0.843,0.137,0.993

83,GME," The term MOASS is a new invention based on conspiracy theories with little to no basis in fact or reality. 

Although rare - a significantly large short squeeze can happen if all the stars align. Short sellers aren't stupid either and they watch and hedge their positions the same way that a long buyer would.  These short squeezes are the result of unusually high short interest with low float stocks. Usually, stocks that experience a short squeeze will also have high day to cover metric. 

The most recent short squeeze of interest is with GME. There have been other notable short squeezes in history such as with Piggly Wiggly back in the 1920's and the Volkswagen squeeze in late 2000's. 

Prior to Gamestop - the other interesting short squeeze that often crosses my mind is the billionaire ego argument between Bill Ackman and Carl Icahn that resulted in the Herbalife short squeeze.",greytoc,3,/r/investing/comments/ouh0z0/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h73a2xz/,0.062,0.863,0.075,0.4734

93,ROIC, The Great Canadian transaction is the biggest sell-out travesty I have ever seen. The company has a casino monopoly on one of the fastest growing cities in North America (Toronto) and it was sold for multiples that reflect crappy regional casino operators in cities with multiple competitors. The company was buying back stock at prices higher than they agreed to sell the company for implying management though it was a good investment ROIC wise even at higher prices. No real process was run to market the company after Apollo made an unsolicited bid. The investment banking advisors gave garbage advice and said it was a fair price just to get their fees. The shareholder base made a big stink about it - only to cave after Apollo raised the price by a couple of bucks.,00nizarsoccer,1,/r/investing/comments/ouil9n/an_insight_into_canadian_casino_stocks/h72zmo7/,0.083,0.806,0.111,0.4588
94,CSCO," I think there is always relativity in valuation metrics, and not just P/E.  

There is always a certain amount of relativity to valuations based on industry -- different industries have different typical P/Es, different P/S etc.  What % of market cap industries are holding definitely affects broad average measures of market.  And market conditions, of course, cause some relativity.  We are in a late cycle bull market - a late cycle bull that has been dominated by Tech which often carries higher P/Es than other industries.  Are today's valuations way ahead of where they often sit in late cycle bull markets?  not really and definitely not compared to the tech led bull that ended in 2000 -- although that one pulls most of the averages up.  The Covid panic also brought a ton of write downs which also has the effect of depressing earnings when looking strictly at P/E, so other valuations are important -- I am suspicious the current market is growing ahead of proof of earnings.

The bear cycle is the only thing that will reset the P/E norm.  Corrections never really do.  And as the bear occurs and matures the average P/Es will become lower than norm but that doesn't necessarily make individual stocks raging buys on a relative basis either.  Some bull market leading companies get their business cycles wrung out pretty hard and may not recover back to pre-bear norms, some may go away entirely.  Look at CSCO as an example of that -- it still hasn't recovered its prior market high.  The current market is interesting to me because it seems kind of like a redo on the Nifty Fifty bull market.

You are right to point out the risk in bonds.  There is a very long cycle of potential rate raises if we are just to return to traditional global norms in interest rates.  That by itself makes stocks more interesting IMO.
