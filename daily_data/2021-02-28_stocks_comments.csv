0,TSM," I really like the enthusiasm, but just be careful with these non-DD DDs.

TSM already has a 590b market cap.  Of course, they’re likely to continue going from strength to strength and the market cap of the entire industry is only going to increase in the coming years but a 4-5x increase within ~3 years would give them a cap of 2.3-2.9t, which would make them the most valuable company in the world.  If you think that they’ll be worth more than Apple or Amazon within that timeframe then go for it.

That’s not to say they’re a bad investment by any means, just don’t necessarily expect a 500% increase within 3 years.",OwenZHunt,1154,/r/stocks/comments/lu8orq/what_stock_do_you_think_is_just_waiting_to/gp647n7/,0.036,0.717,0.247,0.9766

13,RKT," RKT

Not getting nearly the love it deserves. Just had literally a blowout earnings call. They are making so much money it’s ridiculous. They have high short interest (~40% but don’t quote me on it) even after the earnings call. WSB anyone?

On the call, a $1.11 per share one time dividend was announced for next month. Buy shares and hold and you’ll get a free 5% at the current price. Keep in mind I expect it to rise toward the dividend date so get in now if you want. This also really fucks with the shorts because they are responsible to pay for the dividend.

They previously announced a $1 billion buyback which could commence at any time as well. This puts a solid floor on the stock price.

They are still growing an insane amount and they have Rocket Auto coming, they own Amrock, among many other companies under the Rocket umbrella.

The owner Dan Gilbert is a staple in the Detroit area. Everyone knows and loves Quicken Loans and Rocket Companies is the same.

Disclaimer that I am long RKT and this is NOT financial advice, but that should go without saying.

14,AI," Honestly I think wide spread far more powerful AI tech is going to be the next industrial-revolution-tier societal change, so I’ve been looking long term to industries that will benefit from it. 

To name a few: Alphabet(Google)/Amazon/Tesla are the bluechips I’d say fit in that category, Google puts a ton of resources into AI; Amazon’s platform will only benefit from being able to match customers to products better; Tesla is still the safest bet for autonomous vehicles considering how far they’ve advanced the industry by themselves. I think it’s safe to say that even if it isn’t massive growth in the short term, all 3 of these are going to explode directly proportional to the commercially available AI-related technology/algorithms. 

I also believe social media platforms like Facebook/Instagram and Twitter will possibly benefit the boost like the above companies, but I’m not as optimistic about those companies not being replaced by different platforms in the next decade or two. I don’t invest in them based off of that hunch but I might throw some in later if they seem to beat off the competition for longer.

ARK Autonomous ETF is also something I’ve thrown a little into. They invest in companies that benefit from automation/robotics/space exploration, not necessarily AI but close enough to it to fit the category for me. Has a little overlap with the above since they hold Google and Tesla stock. Great track records with profit even at the Covid dip. 


More short term? Not as confident in how to apply it directly to AI, but there’s something tangent to it at least. Semiconductors are more and more in demand every year to the point where we have a domestic shortage, so bad Biden even recently signed an executive order to aid the industry, don’t feel like Tl;dr’ing that, but I attached a link about it. 

So I’ve been dumping a lot of my day trading money into various large and small semi conductor corporations. Bigger ones including: Taiwan Semiconductor  Manufacturing Company (TSMC) [The world’s largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world, huge market share.]; Smaller ones: Alpha and Omega Semiconductor Corporation (AOSL), On Semiconductor (ON) 

Some reading on that if you’re interested:

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/biden-signs-executive-order-to-address-chip-shortage-through-a-supply-chain-review.html

So I think in the next year to 5 years we’ll see massive growth in semiconductor production as demand continues to outpace supply.

The theaters need some way to draw people away from Netflix at home. But home theaters are getting better and better (and for less money). How do theaters compete? By getting better equipment than people can get at home -- and the best off-the-shelf way to do that and still be compatible with industry standards is to install at least one IMAX screen.

We're already seeing a trend of IMAX installs and feature films coming out in IMAX versions. And I think that trend is set to accelerate greatly in the near future as theaters open up again. You're going to see every theater in the country installing at least one IMAX screen ... and every major film production needing IMAX camera equipment. Possibly, before long, IMAX will become the standard movie experience -- what people expect when they go to the theater.

57,FB," FB is really undervalued. Their market cap is currently 600B and I would be surprised if they they don't 2X and reach 1.2T market cap in the coming years. 

The company is not liked and there are risks involved : antitrust regulation, data protection regulations (GDPR), Apple iOS update, ...

But if you are only looking at this you forget everything else.

Facebook has one of the strongest balance sheets with a lot of cash sitting around. They could still survive many years even if their revenue dropped to 0 now. They could acquire companies that could change their entire business. They could buy back many shares.

Their revenue is still growing fast (>20%) but their forward PE is only 22.

Even thought their revenue is currently 98% from advertising,  they have a lot of untapped growth opportunities : B2B and remote work (Workspace), VR (Oculus), E-commerce (Instagram), banking (Diem), WhatsApp monetization... and could also acquire fast growing companies.",knorc,21,/r/stocks/comments/lu8orq/what_stock_do_you_think_is_just_waiting_to/gp5oyvs/,0.035,0.872,0.093,0.859

This is not any kind of DD at all but personally I think that it has a lot of room to grow in the next three years with more and more people getting vaccinated along with states and countries easing COVID restrictions.

I like to compare them to their competitors as Target is to Walmart with Carnival being Walmart. Sure they (Carnival AKA Walmart of the Seas) are a great value and give you a lot for your money but you have to deal with a bunch of people who are on super budgets when going on vacation. For just a little bit more money you have a much better experience and much less trashy clientele.

They have a nice loyalty program which seems to work to bring people back to their ships and they are highly focused on customer service.

My thought is that when COVID is “over” people are going to want to vacation immediately and for me, my favorite vacation was on a cruise so that where I’m putting my money.

122,DD," Yes. I had done an extensive DD on Corsair. Commenting it here! 

 **Core Product**

Corsair is the leading manufacturer of high-performance gear and technology for games and PC enthusiasts. Another important part of their portfolio is the brand Elgato which provides premium studio equipment and accessories for content creators, competitive gamers, and streamers. Currently, their products are in high demand and command a significant price premium against other brands.

**Financials**

Corsair currently has a net revenue of $1.7B (55% increase YoY) and a gross profit of 456MM (107% increase YoY). They had 84% increase in the sales of gamer and creator peripherals. Net income is 103MM compared to 8.4MM loss last year.

They had a gross margin improvement of 6.9% (lesser availability of parts allowed them to jack up their margins) and paid off $190MM debt in 2020. (Current debt of $321MM with $133MM cash in hand)

**Potential and Hype Factor**

People are increasingly spending more and more time on video games and Corsair caters to the premium segment in this market. Adding to this, the current explosion in Twitch viewership and Corsair’s marketing strategy of sponsoring famous streamers to showcase their premium gear further adds to the product demand.

The company is also benefitting greatly from the changing landscape due to the ongoing Covid crisis. As more and more people stay home and abstain from their regular hobbies, they have turned to digital entertainment with PC gaming being one of the leading contenders. In fact, video game consumption is currently at an all-time high and is set to explode even further.

**Risk and Competition**

I see 3 major risk factors for Corsair

a. Supply Constraints: They currently have unmet demand due to supply constraints which benefitted their margins. But a more severe supply constraint can negatively affect their revenue and brand image

b. Return to normal: The current growth rate might not be sustainable once the pandemic is over and people can return to their regular lifestyle

c. One firm owns 80% of the outstanding shares: Corsair is majorly controlled by EagleTree Capital which has majority voting power and an 80% ownership of the company

**Conclusion**

Corsair currently has about 20% market share for gaming peripherals and 40% market share for PC components putting them in an ideal situation to capture any future growth. Although there is some risk in terms of supply constraints and return to normal, their brand, product line, and current financials are put them in a very strong position.

128,RKT," Not to mention, having a mortgage is just a smart use of personal capital in the US. Even if I didn't need a mortgage, why would I tie up all of that capital in a home when mortgage interest is tax deductible and that money is worth way more in the market than the interest costs?

Some people are completely against debt so they will disagree. That's fine, do what makes you feel comfortable. But, before you put extra money toward the principle of your mortgage because you want to pay it off faster, be sure to run a compound interest calculator to see how much that extra capital would be worth at the end of your mortgage term if you invested it instead of paying down your mortgage sooner. Even if you factor in paying off your mortgage 5 or 10 years sooner, you can factor in investing the whole mortgage payment from that point to the original end date of the mortgage.

I ran the numbers for my wife because she wanted to pay the mortgage down faster (because that's what both of our parents did and say we should do too). Even a conservative investment estimate came back at 5x the cost of interest (and 3x when investing the whole mortgage payment after paying it off early). She thought it was counterintuitive but after seeing the models that I put together and double checking my formulas, agreed that it should be a much better use of the extra principle rather than paying down the mortgage faster.

So RKT is a great investment no matter how you look at it. On one extreme, some people will be in debt forever, and on the other extreme... savvy investors who don't even need a mortgage can still take out a mortgage because that capital is worth way more outside of the mortgage than the 3% it costs to borrow it.",bonestamp,6,/r/stocks/comments/lu8orq/what_stock_do_you_think_is_just_waiting_to/gp7nfw6/,0.038,0.851,0.111,0.959

158,AMD," In terms of retail GPUs, desktop hardware, ray tracing tech, sure. AMD vs NVDA could go either way. No issue there. But I don't think that market is going to explode as per the OP though. I'm talking specifically about growth in hardware for deep learning and other ML applications which benfit from highly parallel compute. The market for that is going to grow exponentially and NVDA are poised to dominate it. Cloud based ML platforms, AWS, Azure, they're all running Nvidia compute hardware right now. I don't see that changing. In software, CUDA is far ahead (I recognise AMD has an equivalent but it has nowhere near the same traction). In edge compute, Jetson looks a great starting point too.   


There's tens of millions of people working on assembly lines being paid to carry out visual inspections on products. They're all going to be replaced, I suspect, using Nvidia hardware. When auto manufacturers get their act together in terms of autonomous driving, they're going to turn to Nvidia tech. In defence and security applications, autonomous weapons systems, mointoring of public spaces like airports, analysis of CCTV footage etc, Nvidia tech is what you'll run your code on. Autonomous inspection of infrastructure like highways, rail etc, again Nvidia tech is what will get used. Realtime analysis of people doing their groceries. So many industrial and commerical applications. The market is worth potentially trillions of dollars. Desktop GPUs, crypto etc. that'll be just a side show, something once used to generate revenue to prepare for the real game.

252,TA," Technical analysis is analysis of a stock's past price action, and the use of various indicators (oscillators, moving averages, etc.) to attempt to predict when a stock may move up or move down, and the trader acts on impulses called signals provided by the indicators.

 *The indicators do not send out actual signals*

I use TA, and a trio of indicators I use (Bollinger Bands, MACD and RSI), complement each other very well. 

The lines you see some people draw, they're trying to find a stock's support and resistance lines. Support is the exact price where sellers have repeatedly failed to move the price any lower, and the buyers have come in to take the price higher (think of it like a floor). 

If sellers are successful in taking the price any lower than the support, the old support becomes the new resistance.

Resistance is the exact price where buyers have repeatedly failed to push the price any higher, and the sellers start coming in. If buyers are able to bring the price any higher than the current resistance, the old resistance becomes the new support.

275,AI," Personally, I would advise against using candlestick patterns to guide your investment strategy unless you plan on writing a trading algorithm.

Realize that when you trade, you're competing with the marketplace as a whole.  That means you're going head to head with AI trading algorithms - some with huge funding behind them.  In fact, you're going head to head with the scripts that identified these patterns in the first place.  And, the hedge fund scripts have a huge advantage because they can see where all the stop losses and limit orders are set for retail investors.  (The reason you don't get charged a fee for trading is because you *are* the product - hedge funds pay to see your anonymized order history and queued orders.)  So, it's not surprising that the vast majority of retail day traders generate less alpha than a passive investment in an S&P ETF.

That doesn't mean don't invest.  For one, stocks have a proven track record of going up in the long run.  The S&P is the idiot proof investment, but if you pick a couple ETFs in industries you're bullish on that can work too (provided you're right about the industry).

If you want to get more serious about your DD, you can turn bigger profits investing in individual companies.  But, again, the money is in the waiting.

280,ES," The ""IDEA"" of Risk vs Reward being the sole ""profit generator"" if we assume a 50% rate of being right still doesn't sit right in my head, even though I know it should be true.

And here's why: If you go with a 1:2 risk to reward trade, then you might think ""oh even if I am only right 50% of the time over time this will make money"", but the thing is when you do a 1:2 the distance that the candles have to go in order to cover your ""2"" is 2x greater than they have to go to cover your stop-loss (the ""1"" risk).

So in reality it's not really a 50:50. The higher the RR the less statistical probability there is (all things being equal, if we assume a stock could go up or down at any one moment, I know this isn't exactly true though) that it will actually make it to the reward limit, and the more likely it is that it will instead hit the stop-loss limit.

This is why I don't get how technical analysis works and how all this shit makes a profit to people, looking at it from afar makes it seem like all of this is pure astrology. Just bullshit. I've paper traded for a week now and found it impossible to find any sort of profit, or even pattern, despite following certain youtube-recommended ""strategies"" (granted, ES futures, so not beginner friendly, maybe stocks would have worked better)

I was absolutely ripped apart by people who told me I have no evidence of long positions, and I don’t. I also have no data of how many calls that Shitadelvin sells on a daily basis. But I do know they’re greedy as fuck, and if there’s money to be made, they’re going to let the machine run until they’re poised to profit. 

I was called a hedgie shill by saying that I have reservations about whether or not the squeeze will happen. That’s not shilling or paperhanding. I’m still long GME. I have concerns about whether or not the Shitadelvins of the world are going to allow the free market to prevail, particularly when there are fat options premiums for the taking.

I’m definitely newer to the scene, (CB in mid 60s) and few very well positioned for a long term hold. The squeeze is icing on top. However, I’ve spent time reading through the majority of squeeze 1 and what I see as the main difference is that we have to assume shorts are covering or at the very least hedging effectively now. Supported by your assumption that shorts are in smart places now.

It’s not out of the realm of possibility that a GME short squeeze can cause a lot of players to have to unwind their highly leveraged bull plays on the market, thus causing the whole market to tank. And that would definitely be a very broken thing like you say. 

No idea if this is what’s actually happening and hope it isn’t, but you have the CEO of IBKR saying the first GME squeeze almost destroyed the entire market so there’s some merit to this idea.",Theta_God,3,/r/stocks/comments/lu67zy/opinions_on_monday_market_will_it_be_a_sea_of_red/gp70z5e/,0.086,0.763,0.151,0.8956

GME is held in many EFTs

GME is being shorted using those EFTs to cover the naked shorts/naked puts (I think that is the term)

that pressure is reflected in the GME spikes vs the Indexes

this could happen again over the next few weeks, and will only get stronger as the MM/HFs dig themselves deeper and deeper with their illegal activities.

353,GM," It is true that exiting positions too late to prevent major loss, and too early to see that loss reversed is a major way that amateur day traders lose money, but that doesn't mean the solution is just to hold everything until a profit is made.

1. **Opportunity Cost** If you keep holding a losing position hoping for it to eventually break even, you're essentially keeping that money tied up earning 0% interest for an indeterminate amount of time.  If you have reason to believe that the best you can hope for is breaking even fairly far in the future, you might be better off taking a slight loss, and reinvesting that money elsewhere.
2. **Nothing is Guaranteed** Even if a company is ""too big to fail,"" it doesn't necessarily mean that their share price is guaranteed to come back to its previous level.  During times of financial hardship, companies need money, and to get it they'll either borrow it, or sell more shares.  This means that you're now looking at a company with considerably more debt, which will make them less favorable to investors, even if revenue recovers.  If more shares were sold, even if the overall value of the company recovers (market cap), the share price might not since each individual share has been diluted.  Also, if the shit really hits the fan and the government steps in, it's really easy to get screwed over.  I recall one of my relatives holding GM all through the 2008 recession because they believed there was no way such a big company wouldn't recover with the rest of the economy.  Well, the way the government bailout ended up being structured, nearly all of the old GM's assets got transferred to a new corporation which the government owned, and so shareholders of the old one were left with essentially an empty shell, which existed only to sell off whatever didn't go to the new corporation to pay off its debts.  I think the stock was even renamed to auto liquidators or something.  Now if you buy GM, it's shares of the new corporation, and pre-2008 investors got basically nothing.
3. **Tax Loss Harvesting** If you're holding a losing position that you really don't see coming back up any time soon, and you have other positions you want to realize capital gains on, you might actually come out ahead by taking the loss, because it offsets your income for tax purposes.  This is an advanced topic which you should study in detail before trying for yourself, but remember that the ""return"" of every dollar of taxable income you can cancel out is essentially whatever the tax rate on that income would have been.  So, by realizing a loss on a position that you can only reasonably expect to break even fairly far in the future today might actually put you in a better position at the break even date, once you factor in the tax savings, and the potential to make more money by investing the proceeds from the sale in something better.",__-__-_-_,7,/r/stocks/comments/luh9ht/why_dont_people_wait_to_sell_until_the_stocks_go/gp7jvim/,0.083,0.767,0.15,0.9917

356,GME," It's because of opportunity cost -- sure, you might make all of the money back + 50% after 5 more years, but if you had put that same money in GME at the right time (not recommending this), you could make all of that money back + 300% in a few days.  

It's not super intuitive, but in theory, for the most part the best investment would be having all of your money in whatever asset is appreciating the most at any given time.  While you can't realistically do this and trying to do so would be super risky, you still need to realize that it's not really about ""Ok, I'm down 50% with only $500 left, but I'm sure it'll go back to $1,000+ someday, so I can just wait,"" rather it's about ""Ok, regardless of how I got here, I currently have $500; what's the best way to make that $500 grow going forward?""  Sure you, can keep that $500 where it is and wait 5 years for it to come back, but in the same amount of time you could've moved that money (which involves selling for tax savings) to [insert awesome stock here] that appreciates [300]% in those same 5 years.

364,AMC," There's really only a few reasons to sell at a loss.
First, the company isn't going to get better and you should take your money before it completely tanks.
Second, you can use that money somewhere else for something better.
Third, you're using borrowed money (margin) and you have to pay back you loan.
Fourth, you can take a loss to offset you gains for tax purposes.  

Assuming these things aren't happening, then you can be patient and wait for the price to go up. 

The problem is that as people learn more and build confidence, they take on more risk and think they can beat the system (get rich quick). To avoid this, don't use money that you can't afford to lose or money that isn't yours (margin). Also, as you learn more about how it all works, don't get overly confident and make irrational or emotional mistakes.

Most of my gains have been from doing research and waiting for the price to be low enough to buy and then just waiting and being patient.
All of my losses have been from buying into the hype on stupid stuff or the fear of missing out on something exciting

I bought AMC early in January before the hype because I believe in the company and figured it would come back eventually. That was doing research and being patient. After the spike a few weeks later, I bought more at a higher price thinking it would continue to go up. That was not patience it was greed. I then sold it at a small profit during the second spike due to fear and missed out on more profit or even more potential profit if I just held. Gains are from research and patience.

As an example, MSFT has a low starting yield that may seem discouraging, however their dividend growth is fairly rapid and will quickly add up. To look at yield on cost charts for an estimation of what it looks like, I use seekingalpha > dividends tab > yield on cost.

So far, I have been up 145% on my returns, but due to dividends, I have an extra 0.1 share, which then makes me more dividends next time around. The problem is finding that stock that has a decent yield, but you can also expect to grow a fair amount within the next few years. With the more money you have, you also will see greater yields overall, so my 10.61 in dividend yield last year might be 1,061 if you buy a ton more shares than me.",Clipzzi,2,/r/stocks/comments/lu36pm/growth_or_dividends/gp4it3x/,0.029,0.843,0.128,0.8807
382,CAN," basic and common strategy that seems to work for what feels like forever:

the younger you are, thoe more you should focus on growth.  the older you are, the mor risk-aversed you""should"" be, to simply protect the assets you should have saved and compounded over the years. 

as a 30 year old. I personally would go all growth. or maybe 80/20 or 70/30 between growth (high riosk, high return) and stable / maintaining value. 

once you reach retirement age and you do not have a normal income to finance your daily life, switch over to dividends to boost and support your retirement income. also, costs might increase when you age. think of medical bills, travel that you were not able to do because lack of vacation days etc.  etc.  


the main thing we have to keep in mind in regards to ypour question is the fact that most dividend stocks that pay out dividends large enough to even mitigate inflation are not necessarily growth stocks anymore. yes there are outliers, but those are rare and somewhat risky. matching the avg market of 9-10% with dividends CAN be done, but most stable dividend companies hover more at 3-6 % max. again, outliers exist, but might be around anymore when you reach retirement. (e.g. oil companies pay handsome dividends. god knows how long they will survive though..) 

side note: 

if you are looking for good dividend yields for regular boost of income, take a look at REIT investment.

If You find such a scary moment and have no cash, you lose an opportunity.  In 2008-9 the opportunity rose, and fully invested people were losers. With cash, you could get Ford at $2, and GE at $8.

TDOC is a glorified urgent care that has yet to have a positive quarter, which is a bad sign in a year they should have been profitable.  With insurers rolling-back no cost sharing for telehealth services post-COVID, potential changes in reimbursements models, and competition from every major medical system for telehealth services (and even sole community health facilities, which is what I’m very familiar with),  it’s hard for me to see the long-term growth of TDOC.  Plus, do they recruit good docs and mid-level providers for Primary 360?  How do they handle pre-certs for testing in outside facilities?  Is reliance on self-monitoring a good long-term plan considering many patients have a hard time finding their pulse (is self-BP taking reliable)?  Plus, they don’t accept Medicare or Medicaid FFS.

I'm not saying telemedicine will not be a hot market including all vertical integration of the digital healthcare ecosystem (TBH, dozens of companies have tried in the past even Google took a stab at it, but all flamed out. Not saying that TDOC could make a secret sauce work but in health, information is power and hospital and insurance companies will not give that up, they are the real power in this industry).

All in all, there is a lot of headwind going into 2021 and 2022. I think the market has already priced that in, its flat YTD. There are better growth opportunities elsewhere at least for 2021.

17x NTM sales is incredibly cheap for a company growing at 70-100%, expected to keep that growth rate for at least 3 years, with 65% gross margins, ESPECIALLY in this macroeconomic environment.

* From their quarterly guidance US paid memberships will be up only 2.3% from 2020, and visits will grow by 18% YoY.
* Where is the continued growth of 70-100%? There are significant headwinds to achieving that same rate of growth today without the same impetuous from the Covid pandemic.

Predictive screening and mental health monitoring are also large potential businesses. LVGO is a bright spot, but their membership numbers are paltry.

   2. LVGO comprises of just *1.5% of their membership.*

You’re right, this is [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/), but you’re just ignoring the company because of some bias and small minded analysis and literally ignoring analyst and company projections.

1. 150B, that would be a compound growth of 16%, vs 12% of the S&P 500 over the last 10 years. 
2. 300B, that would be a compound growth of 25% or DOUBLE the S&P  500 growth over the last 10 years. 
3. Possible? Yes. Probable given the competitors, headwind, and risk. Definitely difficult. 

I believe that for TDOC, best purchase price would be under $200 a share, 190$ if possible. Understand that the market is always forward pricing, @ 33B market cap I believe it has already well priced in the growth of 2021 and a little of 2022.

Tax evasion and willful failure to pay taxes are [serious crimes](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/subtitle-F/chapter-75/subchapter-A/part-I).  Insider trading is a serious crime.  Other actions, such as business rules violations, may not get you in trouble with the law but will result in severe restrictions on your brokerage account.

If you have a substantial number of trades in a year, or you trade the same stock frequently, you'll also get flagged by your broker and possibly the IRS and FinCEN.  Then your chances of getting audited increase as your sources of income become more complex... So I would strongly advise consulting an accountant and a tax attorney.

Tax avoidance is not a crime, in fact, it's being taught by former IRS auditors/lax lawers all the time.  Tax evasion is a crime.  There's a difference between the 2.

Your trading frequency has nothing to do with your chance of getting audited.  Your overall income level is checked against your deductions.  If your deductions are out of line with people at your income level then it's a red flag on your account.

Getting audited is nothing serious.  Most of the time, if there is an error to your advantage, you'll just pay the additional tax and a minor penalty.

* m1 isn't really the same thing, it's kind of a ""build your own etf"" type of thing, so it's worth considering in addition to a regular brokerage, not instead of

disclaimer: schwab is definitely my primary and as such, it's possible that using the others more could change my opinion. i opened my schwab account last march, and the rest of my accounts last december when they all had massive sign up campaigns. (sign up bonuses were $30 m1, 4 stocks webull, 4 stocks rh)

 as far as td ameritrade goes, they were bought out by schwab, so they will eventually be getting folded into the same site.

schwab has an awesome website and mobile app, and great customer support. they've also been incredibly reliable in terms of uptime.

webull definitely felt like a big step down the one time i had to contact support. the layout on their mobile app is definitely pretty nice, but i'm not a fan of their website.

at the end of the day, you've got nothing to lose by signing up for all of them, collecting the signup bonuses, and then sticking with whatever one you like best. this lets you find what platform you like best, and you can even keep the others open permanently so that in the event of a GME like fiasco where some brokerages are locking things down and others aren't, or a case where one brokerage has server issues and downtime, you can simply hop onto another account if you want to buy something because there's an amazing deal.",reaper527,1,/r/stocks/comments/lup5sf/got_rid_of_robinhood_what_should_i_use_next/gp82bhm/,0.022,0.788,0.19,0.9935

563,DD," To answer every base your question might be seeking:
- Yes I think new investors are hoping that GME like events will occur more but they simply will not. 
- All the silly slang (to the moon, tendies, etc.) came from Wall Street Bets where it was pretty much contained between the 1.5M of us that were there before. Now there are almost 9.5M members and the quality of the sub has gone down quite a bit.

564,GME," To answer every base your question might be seeking:
- Yes I think new investors are hoping that GME like events will occur more but they simply will not. 
- All the silly slang (to the moon, tendies, etc.) came from Wall Street Bets where it was pretty much contained between the 1.5M of us that were there before. Now there are almost 9.5M members and the quality of the sub has gone down quite a bit.

565,GME," I think you nailed it. This mentality is crazy to me. But GME will likely have a ton of fallout for a long time as far as stock mentality. I am guessing the mentality isn’t that new for WSBs, but given their new size and popularity, it seems like it is spilling over other places. Pretty new around here though so take it with a grain of salt.",rocket-bob,2,/r/stocks/comments/lubaey/has_it_always_been_like_this/gp6orcc/,0.023,0.815,0.162,0.9001
566,GME," GME is special.  There are several things (the following list is not all-inclusive)...

1. GME was (is?) a ""free share"" on a popular stock broker app for some time, making it the first ticker a whole lotta folks got exposed to.
2. GME has been talked about for months prior to the January thing on some subs (I looked back... and I was shocked to see some of the post dates from the fall... the same shit has been going on for a while).
3. GameStop is a video game store.  There is a correlation between people who spend a lot of time on places like Reddit and those that played a lot of video games.
4. Its somewhat unique and one of the few-remaining retail chain stores of its size per store (literally, its size per store; remember Camelot Music? And other similar stores?  They are gone.  GME did survive this long).
5. Unlike a lot of meme stocks and speculative stocks (more the latter), GME is a real corporation and has a real revenue stream.
   1. There are video game consumer profiles who either do not have internet access or otherwise prefer to game offline (yes, it is largely getting harder and harder and it won't work with most games, but it does exist).

&#x200B;

So, if you mean about GameStop, I think its been ""like this"" for at least six months, probably longer.

&#x200B;

If you mean--in general--the market madness, I believe it has been ""like this"" since the 1600s in northern Europe with ""Tulip Mania"".... more to the point, I believe since the inception of the US Stock Market, it has been its own flavor of madness the whole way. (random points below)

1. Back in the 1920s, it was fashionable for ladies to go to the stock broker and talk amongst themselves and buy the latest trending stocks while their husbands were at work.  Apparently at the beauty salons the ladies would talk about which stocks they were going to buy.
2. In the late 90s many ""internet"" stocks went up 4x-50x in months or a couple years.  Some people quit their jobs to invest and--if they got out in time--didn't need to go back to work.
3. Every single day in the stock market their is some madness to be found... Every single day.  There are always movers, surges, price plummets, etc.  Every day.
4. And ever since Tulip Mania, there have been bubbles, and there have been pump-and-dumps.  Everybody (literally everybody) is in this game to make money for themselves.  It is a clusterfuck.  Now, just remember that as a context for absolutely anything and everything you see/read here, in articles, or even professional analysts.",peachezandsteam,4,/r/stocks/comments/lubaey/has_it_always_been_like_this/gp6axg8/,0.039,0.908,0.053,0.6694

579,IMO," short-term trading is a fool's game IMO. it's very, very, very well established that most short-term traders lose money. including professionals. Peter Lynch, one of the most successful investors of all times, specifically says to realize stocks are not a lotto ticket, but rather are ownership of a company. 

the majority of the most successful investors minimize short-term trading. they buy companies they understand and think are a good value, and they hold them for years.

Probability is the gap between knowledge and outcome. Increase your knowledge and increase your probability of correct deduction/induction.

604,IMO," probably not worth it to hire an advisor. you've noticed a possible problem: everyone taking the same advice and piling into the same trendy stocks. 

IMO you should start investing with a core position in an S&P 500 or Russell 1000 index. get broad exposure to the market, or a cross-section of the market. 

beyond that, for single stocks keep them to a minority of overall holdings. do your own research. read up on the advice or strategies of successful investors: Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, etc. ignore almost everyone on YouTube, run for the hills if they talk about Tesla or penny stocks. 

virtually all the successful, real-life investors recommend variations on the same thing: invest in what you understand; learn how to evaluate companies, how to read a balance sheet and do fundamental analysis; avoid trendy and high-debt companies; think independently.",harrison_wintergreen,1,/r/stocks/comments/lulgg6/getting_into_the_stock_market_are_advisors_worth/gp7bfi3/,0.06,0.873,0.067,0.465

as Warren Buffet said: in the past, those infos was hard to find because it took so much effort to find the data. now its all available for anyone to discover. 

it is my main reason my DD consists mostly of verifying if common suggestions to top picks overlap with my own personal strategy. if so, its a buy-. if not, I simply won´t touch the stock.

607,AGTC," I don’t know much about stocks, so this isn’t advice on whether or not anyone should invest in AGTC. I also don’t know much about AGTC’s other products. All I can say is that I have XLRP and have participated in a trial for another company in this field so I have been following the research AGTC and others have been doing for several years now. 

Anywho, it seems like AGTC’s main project is gene therapy for XLRP. It may be important for investors to consider that RP only effects 1 in 4000 people. Not all of those cases are x-linked (XLRP), and not all of those cases are significant enough to require treatment. You should also know that their treatment is not super novel or groundbreaking. There are other companies who are also in phase II trials for essentially the same exact procedure, and Luxturna already exists to treat folks with a similar condition. This is basically just the same treatment but for different genes. 

Basically, there is no guarantee that AGTC will be the first in this field to get their treatment approved if they ever even do, and IF that happens, it would benefit a relatively small number of people, so I don’t know how profitable it would be. That may be why Luxturna costs like $400k per eye. 

Again, this is not investment advice. I just see AGTC getting a lot of hype on Reddit and thought I could share some perspective. Gene therapy for XLRP is very neat and it is extremely likely that treatment gets FDA approval within the next couple years. Hopefully sooner rather than later so I can finally stop bumping into shit everywhere.",KnowsNataliePortman,3,/r/stocks/comments/lua4mk/opinion_on_agtc_genomic_stocks/gp63tln/,0.048,0.82,0.132,0.974

And they finally had their first profitable year in 2020 after 18 years of nothing. So he sat around and spent 18 years developing it at the expense of taxpayers and shareholders.  And now he is one of the richest men because his fortune is tied up in TSLA.  So the way I look at it - he is a welfare king. And us, taxpayers, need to be able to have a share of it since we have been propping it up for 18 years. To be completely fair to him - it isn’t his fault.  That’s how our capitalism works.

2013 was “ rates going up , inflation bla bla bla” market up 30%

2014 was “ easy money been made “ flat year

2015 and early 2016 were -15 or 19% because of some China shit with currency

Brexit + trump sell everything crowd 

2018 “ we far from neutral “ Fed Xmas meltdown and 2019 Meltup back

2020 covid 

2021 so far rates going up again inflation bla bla

661,DCF," **This is not financial advice. I am not a licensed broker, advisor, or planner.**

True business valuation is a triangulation of methodologies.

I start with tangible book value as a filter... I don't bother looking at companies whose P/B is greater than 2... I prefer businesses in the 1.5-1.8 range.  But this is just a stoplight... if it meets this benchmark, I look at the company more closely.  If it doesn't, I skip it.

From here you might use, for example, a DCF valuation, a working capital (net current assets) model, an EV/EBITDA model and then compare industry P/E multiples.  Are they all telling you the security is underpriced?  By how much?  That's your margin of safety.  I like companies trading at least 15-20% below their intrinsic/fair value.

If I'm looking at a business that needs an overhaul of management and their business model, I'm probably going to weight the working capital valuation more heavily than the others.

If I am looking at a solid business that has been producing quarter after quarter of operating cash flow, without restatements or material unusual items, I'm probably going to weight the DCF analysis more.

But I'm not going to look too many years into the future, because companies typically focus these days on the three-year plan.  Beyond that, no company is forecasting in any detail and there's a possibility that accounting rules could change.

Lastly, I always look at the back sections of 10-Q/K's to see if there are any suspicious items in the appendices or supplemental tables that break down the rollups on the cash flow statement.",th3cr1t1c,2,/r/stocks/comments/ltzmdm/what_do_yall_think_is_better_for_valuing_equities/gp3yusv/,0.018,0.899,0.083,0.9337

713,CEO," Tough to say. If you were old enough to invest in 1997, you’d see a company with 250 odd employees selling books online led by a half balding man with a funny laugh. Would you have invested 10k in his company? 

Don’t fall for these articles. Easy to speculate on “what could have happened”.

As for companies out there, look for the right signs - constant revenue growth, CEO who is a genius (not necessarily academically - but Bezos did go to Princeton), with leaders heavily invested and don’t sell the majority of their shares the moment they see an opportunity to cash out and a long-term company vision that may seem absurd/ crazy but could revolutionize the way the world works/ shops/ moves etc. etc. 

Couple of good ones out there - 10X Genomics is an example.

714,BABA," Personally I think if the CEO has become a household name then chances are the company has a good chance of sticking around a while. Of course you want to look at fundamentals too, but a stellar Ceo doesn’t hurt. I know BABA is already a pretty big company in its own right but the ceo is a household name and I don’t even live in China. Couple that with arguably the fastest growing economy in the world right now and their look to expanding further in Europe and I still a lot of future growth. I’ve got a pretty good sized investment into it (nothing too big in case I’m wrong. Something like 2% of my portfolio) but if it grows the way I hope it will, in 20 years that 2% should have grown substantially.",calipfarris01,2,/r/stocks/comments/lug7kh/any_stocks_today_with_amazon_return_potential/gp6a2lt/,0.074,0.722,0.204,0.9497

716,AR," Jeff bezo is always pushing for innovativeness and simplifying new ideas to make Amazon what it is today.
