In other words, they‚Äôd keep the difference of $39 per share they borrowed. That‚Äôs what short selling is, and that‚Äôs how they make profit. HOWEVER, people saw this opportunity and bought the stocks, which raised the price and prevented the investment firms from buying back at a lower price to make profit. The key thing here is that the brokers are charging interest on the stocks that were borrowed, so the longer we hold our shares and keep the price up, the more interest the borrowed stocks are accruing.

Next time you see a stock make a move and end in what you think is a random place, draw a line where it stops on your graph. 
Cycle though some time frames, plot the common SMAs and you will see what acted as resistance.

For the ATR it does change on different timeframes.
Your trade shouldn't be random though, you will be trading a time frame. So you can use that time frame.

I trade the daily and 5m chart so I track ATR on these timeframes.
But actually you don't need to use the ATR itself, you can eyeball it if you like.

By 2050 more than 13 million Americans over 65 could be living with Alzheimer‚Äôs unless scientists develop new approaches to prevent or cure it. 

Every 65 seconds, someone in America develops Alzheimer's. Worldwide, at least 50 million people are believed to be living with Alzheimer's disease or other dementias. According to the United Nations, that is more than the population of Columbia.

Acquisition with PKG 

Cerebain Biotech reported it is in the final stages of its acquisition of PKG, Inc. A privately-owned contract manufacturing and engineering company developing high-end medical and aerospace equipment. PKG was doing millions in revenues before covid hit and was a major contributor in designing and manufacturing numerous and diverse devices for Fortune 500 companies, mid-size organizations, and start-up businesses. Recently PKG reported their registration with the FDA as an establishment producing medical personal protection equipment (PPE), such as surgical masks and clear masks. In 2010, PKG became the first company to develop the touch display device used in medical devices for ultrasound imaging, and received an award from the Idaho Technology Council for Most Innovative Company.

Last Month PKG reported it is set to become the key manufacturer for ClearMask; the first fully transparent, FDA-cleared mask produced in the United States. To meet the rigorous controls necessary for FDA-cleared products, ClearMask LLC and Xometry, the largest marketplace for On-Demand manufacturing, partnered with PKG Inc, an ISO 13485-certified facility, to manufacture the FDA-cleared version of the ClearMask‚Ñ¢. 

Back in 2017 Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ:IMMR), the leading developer and licensor of touch feedback technology,  announced that it has renewed a license agreement with PKG, Inc. who‚Äôs goal is to enable touch everywhere in the digital world. For example touch screens in cars, links with the PlayStation 5 and so on.

335,TLRY,"Nothing, either way the max amount you can lose is the premium paid.


But still, it's a tricky question, technically, you can't lose more than premium paid, but some apps/sites will exercise the option if you have available funds. If you don't, robinhood for example will sell at market price 3 pm (opposed to 4 pm) on the expiration day. You won't ever lose more than you paid in, unless you choose to exercise the option and buy shares for the chosen strike price, but most brokers/sites will still require your consent. 

Say you buy a 1/29 call option for a share currently at $5/share with a strike price of $7. You pay $1 per share, so $100 total. If it's 1/29 and still less than $7 you'll essentially lose that $100.

Same situation, but the stock is now $9. You can exercise that option and buy 100 shares (or one contract) for the strike price, $7, saving you $2 a share minus the premium, or $1 a share, so technically saving $1 a share. Or sell that option to someone else for whatever that contract is now worth, let's say it's now $2 a share, then you'd make back the initial $100 spent plus $100 for that extra $1. 

Of course there's a bit more to it, the rate of decay and volatility play a role in how the contract price fluctuates, but this is a simple explanation of how a call would work. If you want to learn, just read up on basic call and put types and if you have some money you don't mind potentially losing, buy a call and watch the process. My first call was TLRY for 1/22 I believe for $15 at $1.50, so $150 total. It was around $17.60 on 1/18 I think, so I sold to profit instead of letting it grow more by 1/22 (cause I'm a pussy) and the contract had increased in value to $3.40. I made back the $150, plus the $1.90 per share, so I made $190 total after the premium. Had it not gone to $15, it would have just cost me the $150 I put in.",0.059,0.818,0.123,0.9769

396,ZOM,"To use ZOM as an example: the catalyst for their growth is their product launch in March. Now, depending on what price you got in and level of risk you like it may or may not be good to be invested in them. I got in at under a quarter and out at .90 but being in under a dollar and waiting until March is perfectly acceptable if you want a relatively safe pick, provided you don't get too greedy around the product launch. 

A catalyst is basically any news, good or bad, that will change the price tag of a stock. So new products, earning reports, FDA approvals, a new factory opening. These could all be a catalyst for the good, or if it's their competitors, bad. Penny stocks are not usually stable enough for a long term investment so your best bet is finding a penny, looking for upcoming catalysts and financials, and decide if that's a good use of your resources.

https://toronto.citynews.ca/2021/01/23/could-a-psychedelic-gold-rush-be-on-the-horizon/

‚ÄúFor instance, one Toronto-based psychedelic company hired world famous comedian Russell Peters, who has Canadian roots.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm the Chief Creative Officer for Red Light Holland,‚Äù Peters told CityNews. ‚ÄúI got involved with the company via its CEO Todd Shapiro. He asked me if I would come on board and help run the creative side of it.‚Äù

Toronto-based Red Light Holland produces, grows and sells a premium brand of magic truffles within the Netherlands, a place where it is legal to do so.

In an upcoming documentary ‚ÄúVeracity, The Psychedelic Frontier‚Äù which will air on Citytv, our cameras went to Holland to show you their operations. Peters also talks more about the company and opens up about his own struggles.

The hour-long program also documents one war hero‚Äôs mental health struggles ‚Äì and his wild journey from Toronto to Vancouver to use a psychedelic that he hopes will save his life.

618,CO,"To my knowledge: Netherlands, Brazil, Jamaica, and some other smaller countries are all current legal marketplaces to target and are being targeted. 

there is not currently a North American market, but with legalization happening in Canada and with the new administration here in the US, I would not be surprised to see a market develop soon. Oregon just became the first state to decriminalize all drugs. Denver, CO decriminalized psilocybin. And I‚Äôm pretty sure DC has decriminalized psychedelics. so the development is happening. 

Am I early to the party? very well could be, I‚Äôm not much of a stock flipper as that has not worked out well for me. But nonetheless the growth is definitely there. They are e-commerce based plus they are being put in retailers throughout Netherlands. It‚Äôs not that they can‚Äôt supply a global market. It‚Äôs that there isn‚Äôt even a global psychedelic market existing to supply. As new markets develop, they will have an already established brand and product to deploy into the new market.

.0001 bets will make you a millionaire but often its a large shot in the dark. 

Optimal range: .0010 (with resistance at this point) to .0050.

You can still push your money farther, but not as risky as buying .0002 and losing 50%. When it goes to .0001.

.0001 is watchlist - movement to resistance and some good news. Load up.

As I said it's really only better for small <$500 US Pennystocks as the minimum first time trade on a stock is only $10. Another thing to keep in mind, IG charges a $50 fee per quarter if you fail to make 3 trades in that quarter. SW does not charge any fees like this, only the $9.50 trade fee.

As I said SW is better in almost every way EXCEPT for short-term under $500 US penny stock trades. Stick to SW for everything else IMO.",0.057,0.853,0.09,0.5034

I think you can ask yourself what type of an investor are you. Are you more of a long term investor... what‚Äôs your overal goal. This will help your strategy on how you go about approaching the market. 


I‚Äôm sure many will answer your question. Take it with a grain of salt and ultimately decide for yourself. 

As a start, think of the companies you love... check if they are a public company‚Äî what are the reasons you love this company? ( in a way you‚Äôre evaluating the company - you can break this down by- what is their business model I.e how do they make money/revenue, what‚Äôs the management like, what‚Äôs their marketing like, what‚Äôs the public sentiment about them, financials is a huge thing to look at- is this company about to go broke‚Äî- etc 

Another thing you can look at is trends‚Äî- what‚Äôs the big trend right now‚Äî- 5G, EV SPACE, clean energy to name a few

So then you can start looking at those sectors and say ... hmm who are the potential winners in these sectors, and you can go further and research companies that are emerging and then contrast it with the top leaders. 

You might also see what others won‚Äôt see in the companies you want to invest in- always think long term for example Netflix ... if you analyze Netflix stock... it stayed steady and flat right when it first went public... look at the year when it shoot up... study that... Netflix has an excellent business model it allows this company to have massive monthly revenue ... just something to start with...
