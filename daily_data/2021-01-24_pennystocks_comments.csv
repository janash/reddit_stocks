If it were to go down, they would’ve bought it back at that (lower) price (e.g. $30) and returned the stocks to the broker. In other words, they’d keep the difference of $39 per share they borrowed. That’s what short selling is, and that’s how they make profit. HOWEVER, people saw this opportunity and bought the stocks, which raised the price and prevented the investment firms from buying back at a lower price to make profit. The key thing here is that the brokers are charging interest on the stocks that were borrowed, so the longer we hold our shares and keep the price up, the more interest the borrowed stocks are accruing.

Because of this, the upward momentum has exploded. This, however, does not mean GME is a good long-term play. It just means that there are a lot of people playing the gambling game.

Next time you see a stock make a move and end in what you think is a random place, draw a line where it stops on your graph. 
Cycle though some time frames, plot the common SMAs and you will see what acted as resistance.

For the ATR it does change on different timeframes.
Your trade shouldn't be random though, you will be trading a time frame. So you can use that time frame.

I trade the daily and 5m chart so I track ATR on these timeframes.
But actually you don't need to use the ATR itself, you can eyeball it if you like.
The point is that if you set your Stop at exactly support then there's a high chance of it being touched and tested; stopping you out. ATR just gives you an actual value to work with.",0.051,0.87,0.079,0.6537

The number ""72"" in its name is derived from the aircraft's standard seating configuration in a passenger-carrying configuration, which could seat 72–78 passengers in a single-class arrangement.

Alzheimer’s disease. 
 5 million Us citizens live with Alzheimer’s, it’s 6th leader cause of death, 1 in 3 seniors die with Alzheimer’s or another dementia. 50% of primary care physicians believe the medical profession is not ready for the growing number of people with Alzheimer’s. By 2050 more than 13 million Americans over 65 could be living with Alzheimer’s unless scientists develop new approaches to prevent or cure it. 

Every 65 seconds, someone in America develops Alzheimer's. Worldwide, at least 50 million people are believed to be living with Alzheimer's disease or other dementias. According to the United Nations, that is more than the population of Columbia. 

Bill Gates has been globally recognised in helping fight the Alzheimer’s disease! 

If breakthroughs are not discovered, rates could exceed 152 million by 2050. Worldwide dementia care is estimated to cost upwards of US$1 trillion. Alzheimer's is projected to cripple America's healthcare system.

Acquisition with PKG 

Cerebain Biotech reported it is in the final stages of its acquisition of PKG, Inc. A privately-owned contract manufacturing and engineering company developing high-end medical and aerospace equipment. PKG was doing millions in revenues before covid hit and was a major contributor in designing and manufacturing numerous and diverse devices for Fortune 500 companies, mid-size organizations, and start-up businesses. Recently PKG reported their registration with the FDA as an establishment producing medical personal protection equipment (PPE), such as surgical masks and clear masks. In 2010, PKG became the first company to develop the touch display device used in medical devices for ultrasound imaging, and received an award from the Idaho Technology Council for Most Innovative Company.

Last Month PKG reported it is set to become the key manufacturer for ClearMask; the first fully transparent, FDA-cleared mask produced in the United States. To meet the rigorous controls necessary for FDA-cleared products, ClearMask LLC and Xometry, the largest marketplace for On-Demand manufacturing, partnered with PKG Inc, an ISO 13485-certified facility, to manufacture the FDA-cleared version of the ClearMask™. 

Back in 2017 Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ:IMMR), the leading developer and licensor of touch feedback technology,  announced that it has renewed a license agreement with PKG, Inc. who’s goal is to enable touch everywhere in the digital world. For example touch screens in cars, links with the PlayStation 5 and so on.

I find news posted there sooner than anywhere else (you have to sift through a lot of crap, and confirm sources of articles) that helps me grab more shares before the hype train comes in.

335,TLRY,"Nothing, either way the max amount you can lose is the premium paid.


But still, it's a tricky question, technically, you can't lose more than premium paid, but some apps/sites will exercise the option if you have available funds. If you don't, robinhood for example will sell at market price 3 pm (opposed to 4 pm) on the expiration day. You won't ever lose more than you paid in, unless you choose to exercise the option and buy shares for the chosen strike price, but most brokers/sites will still require your consent. 

Say you buy a 1/29 call option for a share currently at $5/share with a strike price of $7. You pay $1 per share, so $100 total. If it's 1/29 and still less than $7 you'll essentially lose that $100.

Same situation, but the stock is now $9. You can exercise that option and buy 100 shares (or one contract) for the strike price, $7, saving you $2 a share minus the premium, or $1 a share, so technically saving $1 a share. Or sell that option to someone else for whatever that contract is now worth, let's say it's now $2 a share, then you'd make back the initial $100 spent plus $100 for that extra $1. 

Of course there's a bit more to it, the rate of decay and volatility play a role in how the contract price fluctuates, but this is a simple explanation of how a call would work. If you want to learn, just read up on basic call and put types and if you have some money you don't mind potentially losing, buy a call and watch the process. My first call was TLRY for 1/22 I believe for $15 at $1.50, so $150 total. It was around $17.60 on 1/18 I think, so I sold to profit instead of letting it grow more by 1/22 (cause I'm a pussy) and the contract had increased in value to $3.40. I made back the $150, plus the $1.90 per share, so I made $190 total after the premium. Had it not gone to $15, it would have just cost me the $150 I put in.",0.059,0.818,0.123,0.9769

I got in at under a quarter and out at .90 but being in under a dollar and waiting until March is perfectly acceptable if you want a relatively safe pick, provided you don't get too greedy around the product launch. 

A catalyst is basically any news, good or bad, that will change the price tag of a stock. So new products, earning reports, FDA approvals, a new factory opening. These could all be a catalyst for the good, or if it's their competitors, bad. Penny stocks are not usually stable enough for a long term investment so your best bet is finding a penny, looking for upcoming catalysts and financials, and decide if that's a good use of your resources.

https://toronto.citynews.ca/2021/01/23/could-a-psychedelic-gold-rush-be-on-the-horizon/

“For instance, one Toronto-based psychedelic company hired world famous comedian Russell Peters, who has Canadian roots.

“I’m the Chief Creative Officer for Red Light Holland,” Peters told CityNews. “I got involved with the company via its CEO Todd Shapiro. He asked me if I would come on board and help run the creative side of it.”

Toronto-based Red Light Holland produces, grows and sells a premium brand of magic truffles within the Netherlands, a place where it is legal to do so.

In an upcoming documentary “Veracity, The Psychedelic Frontier” which will air on Citytv, our cameras went to Holland to show you their operations. Peters also talks more about the company and opens up about his own struggles.

The hour-long program also documents one war hero’s mental health struggles – and his wild journey from Toronto to Vancouver to use a psychedelic that he hopes will save his life.

618,CO,"To my knowledge: Netherlands, Brazil, Jamaica, and some other smaller countries are all current legal marketplaces to target and are being targeted. 

there is not currently a North American market, but with legalization happening in Canada and with the new administration here in the US, I would not be surprised to see a market develop soon. Oregon just became the first state to decriminalize all drugs. Denver, CO decriminalized psilocybin. And I’m pretty sure DC has decriminalized psychedelics. so the development is happening. 

Am I early to the party? very well could be, I’m not much of a stock flipper as that has not worked out well for me. But nonetheless the growth is definitely there. They are e-commerce based plus they are being put in retailers throughout Netherlands. It’s not that they can’t supply a global market. It’s that there isn’t even a global psychedelic market existing to supply. As new markets develop, they will have an already established brand and product to deploy into the new market.

As I said SW is better in almost every way EXCEPT for short-term under $500 US penny stock trades. Stick to SW for everything else IMO.",0.057,0.853,0.09,0.5034

660,IMO,They will be the largest supplier of graphite in North America.  IMO right now is a great entry point.  This could easily run up to $2 on permit news.  PT for full scale production is $15-$20 which will be 2-3 years down the road.  Great long term investment.,0.0,0.806,0.194,0.891

672,EV,"No these are great inquiries. It’s the perfect place to start. Keep asking questions. 

I think you can ask yourself what type of an investor are you. Are you more of a long term investor... what’s your overal goal. This will help your strategy on how you go about approaching the market. 


I’m sure many will answer your question. Take it with a grain of salt and ultimately decide for yourself. 

As a start, think of the companies you love... check if they are a public company— what are the reasons you love this company? ( in a way you’re evaluating the company - you can break this down by- what is their business model I.e how do they make money/revenue, what’s the management like, what’s their marketing like, what’s the public sentiment about them, financials is a huge thing to look at- is this company about to go broke—- etc 

Another thing you can look at is trends—- what’s the big trend right now—- 5G, EV SPACE, clean energy to name a few

So then you can start looking at those sectors and say ... hmm who are the potential winners in these sectors, and you can go further and research companies that are emerging and then contrast it with the top leaders. 

You might also see what others won’t see in the companies you want to invest in- always think long term for example Netflix ... if you analyze Netflix stock... it stayed steady and flat right when it first went public... look at the year when it shoot up... study that... Netflix has an excellent business model it allows this company to have massive monthly revenue ... just something to start with... 

my brain is all over hope this helps",0.015,0.843,0.143,0.9893
