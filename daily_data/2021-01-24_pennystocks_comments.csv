49,ITRM,"Completely fair questions and definitely something I was curious of to. The odds of the NDA being accepted are fairly high due to a few factors:

1. High approval rating (95%)  from the Board of Directors ([Positive Sentiments from ITRM Board of NDA Pre process](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/09/30/2101231/0/en/Iterum-Therapeutics-Announces-Positive-Pre-NDA-Meeting-with-FDA-for-Sulopenem-for-Treatment-of-Uncomplicated-Urinary-Tract-Infections.html)



2. ITRM brought a key Pfizer Submission Specialist out of retirement to work on the NDA process ([Treacy Vargas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/treec34/)). Why bring out someone out of retirement with deep ties to Pfizer and has worked on thousands of FDA/NDA submissions




3. The key efficacy date from their last trial study showed high positive numbers. There is nothing in the study that would cause denial from the FDA on the NDA application as their drug is similar to current industry standards with fewer side effects, so net positive view.

Now I'm not saying this 100% guarantees a approval rating, but there is a 5% margin of error imho. Board assumptions aside, there is a lot of positive sentiments across the board regarding the NDA approval. Pfizer has a vested stake in this approval and they have deep ties with a lot of their prior staff on board.

In regards to the offering, are you referring to the Sarissa Capital clause of 150m shares ITRM has as its disposal? Private placement shares? What I can ascertain from the outstanding shares is rather than do a Public Offering ATM (at the market), ITRM is planning to keep these OS aside for a direct offering / private placement for Sarissa. Why? Because Sarissa is on the board of ITRM and Alex Denner has done this before by taking ownership of the company and removing the board / staff prior to the buyout to absorb the outstanding shares. [Alex Denner cuts MDCO board](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/medicines-company-cuts-board-size-activist-denner-more-185321264--finance.html).

In my opinion, the potential offering clause is for Sarissa to have full ownership of ITRM. Alex Denner wants full control of ITRM to then start a bidding war of Sulopenum and ITRM.",0.033,0.817,0.15,0.9896
50,ITRM,"This is where you have to read a bit between the lines as it's speculation. Durata  staff that sits on ITRM board and senior management are known for taking their previous company to NDA/FDA approval and selling off the drug to the highest bidder. In ITRM's GMA meeting back in June 2020, Sarissa added a new filing to ITRM for a 60% stake ownership of exchangeable notes. In October 2020, Sarissa bought a 33% stake of ITRM. That leaves a additional 30% or so to meet the guidelines of having full control of ITRM. There are no available shares to purchase or offer, so ITRM had to create a additional 150million shares.

The additional 150 million shares being created could _potentially_ and imho, likely a portion for Sarissa. That means that 30% of 150 is 45 million shares to Sarissa to have ownership of ITRM. 

*Why am  I assuming this?* 

Look at the track record of Sarissa and Alex Denner, they have no interest in their previous buyouts to take a drug to production and manufacturing.

*Why does Sarissa and Alex Denner not want to manufacture the drug under Sarissa?*

Because its expensive, time consuming, and they could care less. They added that clause to take ownership of ITRM, utilize a portion of the ITRM's 150 million shares and then after NDA passes or is accepted, leverage the drug approval for a buyout opportunity.

This is why I believe Sarissa will invoke the clause to take ownership, resulting in a direct private offering from the ITRM 150m stock pool. Leaving 105 million shares outstanding at ITRMs disposal. Those additional shares could be used to negotiate the buyout as the buyer would have to purchase non-marketable securities + the vested Sarissa ownership shares.


*Why not offer the 105 million shares in a public offering?* 

I don't see the point. Why would ITRM get NDA approval, be in line for FDA passing and then do a public offering? The extra funding is not required. They don't plan to manufacture and productionize the drug. Hence why I believe Sarissa added the 60% ownership clause to push this company towards a buyout from Pfizer or another larger pharma manufacturer.",0.015,0.846,0.139,0.9915
51,ITRM,Direct offering prices are not known until it is announced to the public. Whatever price ITRM decides to sell the shares to Sarissa for will be known in the coming weeks is my strong opinion. See my post in response to /u/_burahaun for some additional context.,0.0,0.889,0.111,0.6705

56,DD,"My OZSC story...

Last year I began my investment journey. I bought around a dozen stocks on the NYSE. I had always heard in the past the horrors of penny stocks. Was on some sports message board and OZSC and TLSS got brought up. I honestly didn’t do any DD on them nor did I even know what DD was at the time. Decided to buy some even though I told myself they were scams and I was just another guy that was gonna get suckered by penny stocks. I invested about 5k into both and it was money I could afford to lose. 

So for the majority of the summer and fall I watched as both OZSC and TLSS drop to a penny or below. I followed some of the chatter on the yahoo boards and the outlook appeared gloom. I started doing DD and found that TLSS did appear to be a worthwhile investment. I continued to believe OZSC was a scam up until the deal with Wesco and the recent Zeem news. Obviously both stocks are trending nicely now. 

The one thing I have seen other posters say about OZSC that I agree with is I find it off putting that Conway is on social media seeming doing the definition of pumping the stock. I don’t believe it’s necessary and it has created some doubt especially if what he pumped all last week about “the T word” and equity investors and NASDAQ doesn’t come to fruition. I fear if when the PR comes and it isn’t huge news this could really tank. 

I’m not bashing at all as I have had every opportunity to sell both of them at a nice profit. Like I said I have heard others on the r/OZSC board mention their concerns about Conway’s social media posts. My plan is to stay long on both of these and I really feel TLSS is a great long term play.

Bought and sold graphine stock over the past month over interest in possible involvement with a breakthrough, I'm no scientist but I was told the breakout-money will be in the manufacturing process so I took the gains and left

We all want to know what will be the real NEW battery, and to make viable investments on it. It's not going to be that guy with the crane and blocks though - right?

The fact that ATOS is coming to it is not really reflected either.

249,MA,"All charting platforms, that I have ever used, plot the moving average based on the selected timeframe.

For example, on a daily timeframe, 1 candle represents 1 trading day, so 200 period corresponds to 200 day moving average.

On 1 minute chart, 1 candle represents 1 minute of trading, so 200 period corresponds to 200 minute moving average.

If you want to plot 200 day moving average on 1min chart you have to adjust the moving average period, i.e for 1 minute chart, you'd have to calculate the number of minutes is in 200 trading days, i.e 200 days \* 24 hour (in one day) \* 60 minutes (in one hour) = 288000.

This also becomes very clear if you visually compare 200 MAs on both of timeframes and see that they are two different things, here is a screenshot below with 1d and 30min timeframes from your video: [https://imgur.com/a/B5BlwmC](https://imgur.com/a/B5BlwmC)

Edit to add latest $HPQ.V latest news release. 

Not financial advice. Do your own DD :)

These are long plays for me. I'm holding for at least a year, probably more. (Recently asked for a reminder 4 years in the future)

Positions:

$HPQ.V - 15.000 @0,5952

$PYR - 1000 @2,? (They graduated to the big boy exchange in Canada and ticker change messes with the average price in my broker portfolio, I'm up around 100%)

Our team has decades of experience in all aspects of business development in both domestic and international markets. 

My view 

Lots of corporate crap - feels like a company that trys to spot emerging markets and acquire start ups/companies at the beginning of their growth. 

Why do I think it is interesting.

They have stated intent to acquire Carbon-Ion, formerly ZapGo. 

ZapGo LTD which has developed a new category of energy storage device called Carbon-Ion™ of C-Ion®. This technology charges 50x faster than lithium-ion batteries, and radically improves the performance of supercapacitors by using high surface area carbons and ionic electrolytes.

Great YouTube video with more detail on the summary above.

They also have already acquired Medicevo Corporation - who announed the launch and availability of its Graphene Face Mask, which it states is proven to filter 98% of COVID-19 particles, setting a new safety standard of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE). Medicevo's Graphene Face Mask has been rigorously evaluated using the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards for Medical Face Masks. The same tests that PPE used in hospitals, and by first responders must pass for use in high-risk situations.

So they have a portfolio that includes COVID and the EV market.

Share growth/Market Cap

The share price grew by 52.58% on Friday - despite little hype. Significant in one day and I can't see an obvious catalyst or P&D reason.

Price at the time of writing $0.455 and the volume was 3 times the average number on Friday. 

Took me a while to find the Market Cap - which is about $143m.

One risk seems to be, authorised shares are 2.5bn although they have only currently issued 483m. I do wonder of they will dilute if the proce gets too high - although if this went into further acquisitions, it wouldn't be a bad thing.

Overall opinion

I'm struggling to see how this hasn't got much attention. It seems to have mass potential, but I'm still relatively new to investing.

I have a position - very small as below. So I'm not pumping this as I have thousands on the line or want a quick win.

Development-stage medical device company focused on the creation and clinical development of a minimally invasive implantable device. The device leverages the clinically observable, positive impact that omentum stimulation has on cognitive function as related to dementias, and in particular, Alzheimer’s disease.

Alzheimer’s disease. 
 5 million Us citizens live with Alzheimer’s, it’s 6th leader cause of death, 1 in 3 seniors die with Alzheimer’s or another dementia. 50% of primary care physicians believe the medical profession is not ready for the growing number of people with Alzheimer’s. By 2050 more than 13 million Americans over 65 could be living with Alzheimer’s unless scientists develop new approaches to prevent or cure it. 

Every 65 seconds, someone in America develops Alzheimer's. Worldwide, at least 50 million people are believed to be living with Alzheimer's disease or other dementias. According to the United Nations, that is more than the population of Columbia. 

Bill Gates has been globally recognised in helping fight the Alzheimer’s disease! 

If breakthroughs are not discovered, rates could exceed 152 million by 2050. Worldwide dementia care is estimated to cost upwards of US$1 trillion. Alzheimer's is projected to cripple America's healthcare system. Total payments for health care, long-term care, and hospice for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are projected to increase from $290 billion in 2018 to more than $1.1 trillion in 2050 

Acquisition with PKG 

Cerebain Biotech reported it is in the final stages of its acquisition of PKG, Inc. A privately-owned contract manufacturing and engineering company developing high-end medical and aerospace equipment. PKG was doing millions in revenues before covid hit and was a major contributor in designing and manufacturing numerous and diverse devices for Fortune 500 companies, mid-size organizations, and start-up businesses. Recently PKG reported their registration with the FDA as an establishment producing medical personal protection equipment (PPE), such as surgical masks and clear masks. In 2010, PKG became the first company to develop the touch display device used in medical devices for ultrasound imaging, and received an award from the Idaho Technology Council for Most Innovative Company.

https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/uk.movies.yahoo.com/amphtml/cerebain-biotech-announces-pkg-inc-133000957.html

Last Month PKG reported it is set to become the key manufacturer for ClearMask; the first fully transparent, FDA-cleared mask produced in the United States. To meet the rigorous controls necessary for FDA-cleared products, ClearMask LLC and Xometry, the largest marketplace for On-Demand manufacturing, partnered with PKG Inc, an ISO 13485-certified facility, to manufacture the FDA-cleared version of the ClearMask™. 

Back in 2017 Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ:IMMR), the leading developer and licensor of touch feedback technology,  announced that it has renewed a license agreement with PKG, Inc. who’s goal is to enable touch everywhere in the digital world. For example touch screens in cars, links with the PlayStation 5 and so on.

664,BE,"I don't generally chase a runner, but if I do, here is how I do it:

Observe pre-market activity

Wait for the dip (there is always a dip, it just may not be below the opening price.) and watch for confirmation of support (the next dip does not go below the previous dip).  I like to look for three bounces off support.  This can take as little as 30 minutes up to a couple or three hours.

Now I look for upward movement, so as the stock goes up, it either meets or beats the previous high from the last time it moved up (not including the initial opening dip), and when the price dips, it does not dip below the previous low.  Basically you are looking for a staircase pattern.

One potential entry point is once you see support confirmed (still high risk as shorts are in play).  The next potential entry point is to watch the price movement as it provides ongoing higher highs and higher lows, and enter as it breaks the high of the day (shorts are covering, new shorts are moving in).

A third potential entry point is when the price exceeds the pre-market high (more shorts are covering, new shorts moving in).

"" I would’ve missed out if i waited for a dip "" is FOMO.  It is ok to miss a run.  THERE WILL BE ANOTHER ONE TOMORROW.  I am not saying FOMO doesn't work sometimes, but it forces the buyer to get in at a high risk entry with a substantial downside.  So I would say don't fall in love with a stock.  If it runs, and you missed it, move on to the next one or wait for the next dip.

Just my dumb a$$ opinion.",0.095,0.843,0.062,-0.8501

I've never had Schwab crash for me. I've never had a stock that I could buy on one of those and not the other. So what exactly are you talking about?",0.0,0.948,0.052,0.3855

719,DD,"It is a little different then gambling... or it can be. You can always pick a winner if you do your DD and have the right level of patience. 

Also when I hit the casino its really hard to slap the 🚀 on the table",0.037,0.838,0.125,0.6086
720,DD,"Personally, the $5,000 I started with was half of my savings at the time and it was money I managed to save up over the last 5ish years while working minimum wage throughout high school and college. 

Instead of letting 10g sit in a mutual fund making %5 a year, why not do some DD and spread it across 4-5 tickers each with possible 100% over a week/month/year? 

""it's all gambling"" If all you follow is pump and dumps. Maybe find some legitimate companies like ALPP ABML and many others that are going to be huge companies in their respective sectors for many years to come. I don't think anyone was gambling when they bought them, those are calculated investments, unless you blindly throw money at tickers you're not gambling.",0.02,0.898,0.082,0.7964

722,DD,"I agree 2 years in the first year all I did was make safe plays, 10% gains for the year. People will say that’s good. But it felt boring, not much DD on companies that are already valued high. I can’t claim to know why people come to r/pennystocks  but I did it because I’ve been curious about how they work. I started investing and actually doing the DD on stocks. Now I’m way more engaged in this community and the stock world as a whole",0.018,0.783,0.198,0.92
723,DD,"The median age on this sub is probably around 20. Many inexperienced and young people think that the stock market is a casino or an ATM. 

I was trying to say that by doing a proper DD, diversification and risk management you can have better odds than 50/50 when trading or investing.",0.04,0.904,0.056,0.2023
724,TDA,"I have the same issue with TDA. I never have enough cash waiting for me, and end up missing good swings because it doesn't settle in time. Can't trade the cheap OTC stock on Robinhood or Webull, which sucks because the instant settlement on Robinhood is amazing. Now that this conversation got me thinking about it, I'm going to dump some money into my TDA account now haha.",0.095,0.779,0.126,0.5267
