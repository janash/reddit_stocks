 It is a risk that has DOOMED many a person.  Not really investing, but gambling.  Actually, if you ask nearly ANYbody their worst investing story that they know of the commonality of ALL of them is taking on too much single company risk.

21,DD," DD allowed me to have the conviction to take this recent size. I have always liked the trust under $3 and I started adding around $2.70. I live in this area and I know the company(customer of mine for almost 2 decades). My hold off is they changed operators for drilling in early 2020 and the transition left a gap and I wanted to see some drilling first. The fields are proven for decades and vast with infrastructure pipeline already in place.

Also there is a large Nat Gas refinery being built in the same area as their fields for clean gasoline products. If someone's investing $9B in Pennwell, TX(Google map it and you will laugh) than others have more to lose than me on these areas. These are technically EGS since they do not do the drilling/completion and only contract out, but semantics. Adding a bit of green to it rocket fuel or clean gasoline is a nice added benefit and potential hype.

53,DD," Interesting stock. 

Looks like they had a RS that in 2/2020 (1:4000)  which is why they have such few shares.  They have Auth Shares as 15 MILLION.  So not a big potential dilution by numbers, but would be 6x the current OS.  I would figure it is almost a guarantee that they will end up diluting as the company needs money to grow.  Tough situation for early investors.  You want to be at the basement level, but you stick in their taking full risk of failure and when they start to be successful they start diluting to raise funds.   Then if they need more money (with only 15 million AS) it will have to start taking on toxic debt to keep expanding.  

This is sort of the BIZARRO world version of Humble and their share problems.

55,REG," They actually have a current REG A offering underway. So far they have raised about $3M of a $15M goal for the offering at $2 a share. Anyone can buy REG A shares. They have stated they hope to have an OS of about 5M shares when the offering is finished. Which will be very undervalued still especially if some people's revenue projections come to fruition. So yes the OS is currently being diluted, but in a healthy managed way. The company has also my bed away from toxic financing as shown by the REG A offering. I understand the dilution fears, this is the OTC, but this company has stated NASDAQ goals and their actions are proving it, until they don't. As revenues increase so will profits. Combined with the capital raise and increase in revenues, I expect profits to grow each succeeding quarter. Only time will tell.",Justjoe1979,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/n7qyrs/10_reasons_why_fles_is_the_most_undervalued_otc/gxf7bba/,0.053,0.792,0.155,0.9387
56,ETSY," That's a great question. It is a pretty fractured market and hard for anyone to become profitable. They have been super successful in their niche with very little advertising growing to $10M+ in revenues in just a few years. 

In so doing they have recogni9azed the fractured market, and are implementing their multi-vendor auto-parts only marketplace this summer. Think ETSY, but for auto parts only. They are looking at providing a resource to actually help their current competitors and turn those competitors into customers to help them sell more product at better margins. They already have 15 vendors signed up per their investor Twitter call with 2 of those vendors selling 3M+ SKUs. They are also looking at other verticals to incorporate to the marketplace. B2B and B2C programs, Wholesale buyer program for local shops to order straight from manufacturers and distributors direct at wholesale prices. Will call at local parts store like NAPA, Auto Zone and Oreilly's. They are also looking at installation services as well. Buy it from their site and get it installed at a local partner shop if you don't want to do it yourself. I can even envision mobile installation by ASE certified technicians.

They are looking at providing a major solution to all the issues with buying auto-parts online. They are looking to repair the fractured market.

Here is a recent podcast where Christopher Davenport Founder and President of the company is explaining the vision of the company. Worth a listen if you have time.

59,DD," Actually, their last 3 10Qs showed profit.

They have paid off another $1M in debt subsequently and now have a total of about 1M in non-convertible debt left that could be paid off soon as a result of the ongoing REG A capital raise. 2nd Quarter 2020 10Q showed a gross profit for the first time with an even larger net profit.

65,SP," Can u explain why itâ€™s a buy?
If u ask for other opinions, I would like to hear ur opinion.
Just looked it up and I donâ€˜t agree with the buy target.
The first thing I always do is looking at their website and their website is just poor and not even encrypted.
I am even a bit familiar with their business since I was writing driver and some algorithm for printing machines. But I donâ€™t see them growing that big and I donâ€™t find any reason why the price target should be raced that much. Btw I was looking for price targets and the average was 5$. So definitely not 2743%.
The other thing was already pointed out: negative cash flow.
So logical there is no reason to invest in this company at all.

Share price bounced around between $2 and $2.25 this week. Closed the week at 2.18 (2.14 is a marked area of support/resistance) 

Earnings were reported on wed. Loss of 8 cents per share. No surprises in the earnings release. We knew they paid off all debt already. 

Cushing added TELL to another one of their indexes. 

Blackrock purchased an additional 2M shares.

Henry Hub is just shy of $3. Souki has said in the past that the $3 level makes drilling profitable enough to pay for a well about a year. Tellurian resumed its drilling program after 2.5yrs.
