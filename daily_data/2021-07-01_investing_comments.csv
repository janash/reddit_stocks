2,AMD," Its great until you sell a CC on one of the stocks you’ve been holding forever, that hasn’t been doing shit, and it moons overnight and you miss all the gains, getting your shares called away. Sucks to hold something for months and months then sell a cc and watch it get called away the one time it actually does something. Some stocks are like that, trade flat for 6 months or more then go on a massive tear upwards all at once before trading sideways some more. Just look at Amazon, AMD, and countless others…

You miss out on far bigger dollar amounts than you gain in the long run usually. The few dollar premium just doesn’t seem worth it most of the time. The times I do sell covered calls in my stuff it’s after a massive run when IV is jacked to the tits and it’s usually as safe as I can make it by being way OTM.

There’s other reasons too. Say I’m in a trade and my price target for the stock is 100$ a share. I sell a cc for $125 because I’m not thinking it’ll get that high.

If the stock goes down you're locked into holding your underlying 100 shares per CC sold, not allowing you to be flexible and exit the position. This is only your only overall loss scenario.  


If stock trades sideways or barely just reaches your strike you're pretty happy because you make a profit off the premium.  


The final and largest risk is if the underlying stock absolutely moons and you miss out on all the extra profit between the market price and strike price.

1) they are a source of frustration.  Most people are not psychologically well-suited to selling covered calls, and finding options strategies that suit your psychology is critical to consistently implementing those strategies.  


2) A covered call behaves identically as selling a put (dividends can cause slight differences in practice).  Does selling puts sound as good to you?  


More about the frustrations...

The premiums are usually quite small. They just don't look attractive. It's hard to get it up for 1% premiums on monthly CCs.  


They limit the upside of the shares. Nobody wants to sell a $10 covered call for 25 cents and watch the stock go to $10.50, or worse $15.  Then you start thinking about changing your strategy and rolling the call up and out for a credit, and if you do that you have to hold the shares even longer and face the same dilemma eventually. Or worse the shares go back down and your new calls don't because the delta is small (too far in the future, too far OTM). Now what? Roll them back down and repeat? ***The only appropriate exit strategy for a covered call is to buy the call back (or roll it out) when it's close to parity, or to let it expire and/or the shares be called away.***   


You can't sell your shares because they are collateral! This is why you don't sell covered calls with high volatility stocks. Here's a totally made up story - I bought 100 shares of GME at $120 on a Monday and sold $360 CC for $45. On Wednesday it shot up above $300 and I was faced with a dilemma -- do I hold until Friday and pray the shares don't crash? Or do I buy back the call option (now $105) and sell the shares to take profit?  In both cases I would be fine, but the decision is tough and you might not feel great if you pick the worse option. Personally I didn't have a choice because I didn't have enough money to buy the call back.  The stock tanked and I ended up buying the call back for $65 and selling the shares at $160 for a modest profit.   


Another is that your stocks can get called away. Most of the time, you own shares because you want to keep them. Don't sell covered calls on those, because eventually the shares will be gone. Covered calls are ***only appropriate when you don't mind handing over the shares.***

Ok, then what about selling strike above cost X? Actually X + some extra, because selling CC would reset my holding period and thus increase taxes (this is highly dependent on local taxation laws, yours may differ).

If you plan on holding until a certain price target then cash covered options are great for a bit of passive income to build on your position or do whatever with.  Also if you want to have a stop loss set, you'll need to actively monitor your position so you can buy the contracts back in order to sell those shares.  Depending on the security, the premium might not be worth locking up a position for an extended period of time.

2) Price drops (or even rises) after hours or pre market.

the other account holds a few hundred twlo.

i do CC on those cause its a necessary evil, and the premium gained helps me accumulate more shares of tickers i want.

but i will not do CC (anymore) on anything else.

if you have cc on a stock you wanted to keep, and it runs away with from you , its stressful.

CC make you go against your nature, you actively root for negative bear shit.  


i know there are people that will say hey you made ""max profit, be happy!""

man so much of ""investing"" is working around your own psychology.  you are who you are... and if CC make you feel like they do me... then just dont do them.",rvncto,1,/r/investing/comments/obb3mc/why_dont_more_people_do_covered_calls_whats_the/h3op8rr/,0.129,0.764,0.107,-0.8096
41,CC," One of the more unknown catches about CC less than a monthly CC is it resets the holding period of the underlying.

42,CCIV," I’ll give you an example of the risk and reward of covered calls because I do them quite often and they are a great source of income, but you need to understand when to sell them. For instance, I have made thousands selling covered calls for CCIV. Probably more than I have gained through the stock alone. The trick is selling these calls during periods of high volatility to the upside. I believe it was in March I sold $55 covered calls that’s expired in May for about $2K. I knew the price wasn’t going there with no car in production yet. I also just sold another set of covered calls this morning and collected another $1500 in premium for the Aug 20 $55 strike. It’s a great way to make some extra money off your stock but there is some risk involved. 

For example, I bought Chargepoint stock back in like April at $27.50 and it dropped down as low at $20 from then to May. Needless to say I was ticked off at my stupidity so I sold a covered call back in May for the price I bought it for. I wasn’t happy with its performance and figured I’d be happy selling it for what I bought it for. Fast forward about a month and the price of Chargepoint is at about $33 at expiration so I lost out on potential profits I could have made. 

Overall, covered calls are a fantastic, low risk way to collect extra money. You just need to understand when to sell them and have a strong understanding of the underlying stock and it’s future potential leading up to the expiration date.",Turius_,1,/r/investing/comments/obb3mc/why_dont_more_people_do_covered_calls_whats_the/h3oyhbz/,0.103,0.765,0.132,0.9419
43,CC," Well first of all a lot of people do sell covered calls. Maybe not everyone but there are plenty of people out there that do. 

There are many reasons why some people don't sell CCs though too. Here are just a couple:

One reason a lot of people don't sell covered calls because it caps the upside of your investment. If the underlying is at $18 and you sell a CC at $20 for .50 premium and the underlying blows through the strike price to $24 your upside is now capped at $20.50 and you're missing out on the rest of the price increase and that's a big turn off for a lot of investors.   

Another reason people don't do them is because you have to actively manage your positions when you do them and a lot of people just aren't interested in that. They want to invest money into some stocks and then let their portfolios do their own thing.",BB_Captain,1,/r/investing/comments/obb3mc/why_dont_more_people_do_covered_calls_whats_the/h3ozmrv/,0.046,0.9,0.054,0.1187
44,BB, I’m loving it. I spent ridiculous amounts on BB the avg was like almost $14 now my cost basis on 300 BB shares since January is down to $8.85.

45,AAPL," There is zero additional downside risk taken on selling covered calls. They are an excellent way to generate extra income. The drawback is you're potentially giving away upside if the stock is trading through the strike at expiry (really any day up to expiry for American options but they rarely get exercised before the expiration date).

I have long term positions in AAPL and MSFT I sell calls against every month. The calls I sell are well out of the money but generate a decent income that I would not have otherwise had.

Another thing to keep in mind is that the premium effectively increases the strike price for you when selling covered called. i.e. if you sell a call against XYX with a strike of $50 and you receive a premium of $2.00, as long as the stock is still below $52 at expiry, you've made money you would not have otherwise had.

You're not missing anything here. Covered calls are great. Many people don't understand options so don't mess with them and for those that do trade options regularly, they are not particularly interesting because what you sell them for is the most you can make on them.

I would recommend learning a bit about option pricing - the primary, non-intrinsic driver of option premiums is implied volatility. When that is higher than historical volatility, you can say the option is ""expensive"". Vice versa and they're cheap. A driver for volatility increase is often an expected event like an earnings release, new patent pending, drug approval, etc.

Sell when the IV is ""expensive"" is the equivalent of selling high on an option since they die regularly and you can't view them on a 52 week basis.

&#x200B;

I find them especially interesting when buying a new stock - if you like the stock, do a buy write with a call option that is a month out from expiry that's 10% higher  (or whatever you are comfortable with) than the current price.

47,ST," Often times the small premium gain isn't worth the tax impact of your shares being sold. For example:

Sell 10 covered calls for $0.50 premium on each call. So you get $500 in premium value. 

Buyer exercises the option forcing you to sell your 1000 shares, which you had a $10,000 ST gain on. Depending on your tax bracket, you'll most likely pay more than $500 in tax. 

So unless you can get away with selling out of the money covered calls a bunch of times or have a marginal tax impact by liquidating your position, it may not be worth it.",JaiminDesai93,1,/r/investing/comments/obb3mc/why_dont_more_people_do_covered_calls_whats_the/h3pbsdj/,0.046,0.83,0.124,0.8621

49,CC," If you take as a baseline that options are efficiently priced, selling covered calls are going to have an EV exactly the same as not selling covered calls, less contract fees, so it's a waste of time.  The $$ you make on theta is going to be washed by the $$ you lose due to assignment, and you just lose the couple of cents you pay per contract to your broker.

Of course people who sell options don't believe options are efficiently priced, they believe they can exploit IV mean regression to buy/sell options in a way which generates positive EV.  The basic thesis is that you sell options when a stocks IV is elevated (so high IVRank) and buy options when the stocks IV is depressed (some people don't do this part, but it's functionally the same logic), because you exploit Vega this way, which (so the theory goes) is actually more predictable than things like directional bets on stocks.

Either way, what most investors tend to find is proper CC management (deciding when to buy to close, what strikes and time frames to sell over, tracking IV) is a lot of effort considering the actual edge you might be able to exploit.  For a lot of investors spending that same amount of energy and attention finding better opportunities to establish long positions is a more attractive way to generate returns.  Practically people tend to sell covered calls for financial goal reasons (i.e. they rely on the generated income) or psychological reasons (i.e. they are incompetent at deciding when to sell).  These are not mathematical things so they aren't associated with a trading edge.  CCs are also popular as part of diagonal spreads as they give you access to cheap leverage, which can multiple the edge you perceive having.  This is more rational than selling CCs on traditional long positions.",pWheff,1,/r/investing/comments/obb3mc/why_dont_more_people_do_covered_calls_whats_the/h3pe4di/,0.063,0.855,0.082,0.882

Covered calls don't force a sale. In fact they prevent you from selling until they are exercised or bought back.  If it skyrockets, it has to STAY in the sky until expiration.  But stocks that skyrocket also plummet, so you have to hope it doesn't happen before expiration. Just set a limit sell order if you want to force yourself to sell at a certain price.

They make up a large part of my portfolio and are all around 50-70% losses. I'll never buy a stock without options again. 

Sell cash secured puts weekly until it hits the price you want to buy at for ~$100 a week. Once you're finally assigned, start selling weekly covered calls.   
Ideally when assigned, you've already collected enough premium to make your cost basis a few bucks lower per share. For instance I got assigned for RIDE @ $10, but up to that point I already collected $200 in premium from prior weeks which made my cost basis $8. 

I roll them every week perpetually if I can make profit (if can't roll for profit then I go 2-3 weeks out).  My goal is to keep the shares for a year and not pay capital gains.

96,LMAO," I guess I'll have to pick this apart one by one.

> Consider the people who had index funds and were close to retirement in 2008. They never retired. It took years to recover. And their brokers, who made money on the downside, stopped taking their phone calls.

This point is incredibly irrelevant - putting aside the fact that someone who's about to retire should never have all or even most of their savings in equities... if they held for 4 years, their savings would have recovered to their pre-crisis level.  Sure it's not ideal, but imagining the absolute worst case scenario where someone is retired and put all their money in equities at the top of the market, they would have made it all back by 2012.  The people who got hurt were those who panicked and sold everything at an inopportune time (which makes the case for my suggestion that most people are better off setting it in a fund and closing their eyes).  The alternative would be not buying equities at all - which you'd be worse off doing in the long-run, and that's a fact - or actively managing your portfolio/trying to time the market - which is a fool's errand.

Many people lost their livelihoods in 2008... but it wasn't because of the stock market.  It was because they lost their homes, jobs, and were put on the street with no recourse.  Recessions happen, and that's a reality of investing.  It's unfortunate that some are unlucky and need to push their retirement a few years out to allow their investments to recover.  But that's the reality of investing, and in the long-run, you're (99.9% of the time) better off having money invested vs. sitting in cash and hiding under your bed for fear of losing.

Also ""brokers who stopped taking their phone calls"" - LMAO... talk about dramatic.  Maybe there were like 2 brokers somewhere who did this, but you watch too many movies. Give me a break.  

> So to me, when you work 40 hours per week for 40 years earning that money, you should be investing at least SOME time learning how to manage it at some point in your life. Most people have been convinced to NEVER learn anything about managing the money they spend 80,000 hours earning. In fact you just recommended it. It’s criminal.

No, absolutely, people should learn how to manage their personal finances. You're misconstruing my point.  And guess what, if they're listening to the right people, they'll learn that their best course of action is to not overthink things, and put their money in diversified indexes of stocks and bonds to compound in a tax-deferred manner without trying to introduce any complicated strategies that will most likely make them worse off in the long-run.  **Put differently, show me the data that shows that putting your money in indexes isn't the best strategy for a retail investor over the long run, and I'll send you the data that shows you're wrong.**  As much as you think this is something that ""favors the brokers"" or whatever nonsense you're saying, my points are objectively true and you're just appealing to people who are inclined to believe everyone is conspiring against them.  In fact, my advice goes counter to what many brokers would tell you, so a fail to see how yours is a narrative that makes any sense.

> The religion of “markets always go up over time” and “markets are too complicated for you” are lies that serve only the broker-dealers.

Except markets do always go up over time?  And if you don't believe that, you shouldn't be investing in the markets?

And ""markets are too complicated for you"" is not the argument I'm making, and I reject the notion that it's what the industry is doing these days.  The argument is ""with hundreds of millions of market participants, from quants, to institutions, to professional investors, markets integrate information so quickly that they're efficient enough where it's highly statistically unlikely the average investor can outperform a broad market index over time without taking on idiosyncratic risks in their portfolio.""  And by ""average investor,"" I'm including professionals. 

> I’m not telling people to day trade. I’m telling them to take responsibility and be involved in their own retirement.

I agree. And I'd hope that most people who take the time how to learn to invest their own money come to the conclusion that putting their money in a ""set it and forget it"" type of strategy is the best course of action, because it is for most people.  Suggesting that covered calls would be even near the top of the list unless you have a very specific idea in mind is crazy... lol.  

> Now. Your questions. You get downside protection by buying puts, and you mitigate unrealized losses with covered call income. But it’s not a few % annualized.... have you uses these strategies? It’s a few % weekly on volatile names. A few % monthly on quiet names.

You suggested writing puts, not buying them. If you're generating that kind of premium income, you're doing strategies that are either long-dated, close to ITM, or highly volatile where you're likely to be called away, which again is fine if you actually want to get rid of a position, but not a strategy that makes sense for most people.  You sound like you're doing this weekly which makes me think it's a combination of the last two.  It only makes sense if you're trading individual names - on indexes you're likely to be called away at some point, in which case you just forced a gain on something that could have compounded tax-deferred over time.

And yes, I've used these strategies.  I am a professional investor and ran a $250M covered call portfolio at my prior firm :)

> Now let’s consider the case where a stock rips through your covered call. You took your premium income on your position, and it gets called away. You still took in your premium. 

Yep, you took in the premium, but you also were forced to take a taxable gain on the position.  If your intent was to continue holding, that is a bad outcome.

> Now you write the put and get paid to catch it on the rebound, or else get paid again on the put premium. These weekly contracts have made it even easier and more lucrative.

How you're saying this suggests that you don't actually know how it works, which is strange for someone who's so pro-the strategy.  Yeah you get paid to catch it on the rebound... if it expires in the money.  You're just market timing using options, which is a loser's game.  Again, the opportunity cost of being out of the market/risk that you don't actually get back in, plus the unnecessary gain you took by getting called out to begin with, makes this a very tax-inefficient strategy that is not suitable for most people (other than maybe people who have specific goals in mind, or are Warren Buffett).

> There is nothing about spending 2 hours a week setting up a strategy that resembles giving yourself open heart surgery. 

*Whoosh* - my point was that suggesting that something that works for a professional with 70 years of experience in the markets, let alone a professional who is an outlier among professionals, is something that would work for everyone is a funny concept.

128,IMO," I mostly invest in index funds largely for the reasons you gave lol and I do think markets are fairly efficient overall. I also just don't like spending significant time doing research into single stocks. It's just not that fun to me. However, I do have a sizeable amount of my portfolio in Microsoft, which is my only single stock investment. With that said, some people do okay with stock picking and some just have fun with it, so there isn't anything wrong with it IMO. 


Here are couple things you could say (not really one liners, but you could easily paraphrase):

1.) It's fun and you enjoy doing research into stocks. As long as you're managing your risk, you'll still probably make money and will have fun doing it even if you underperform or just have the same performance as the market. There's also the possibility you could outperform and make more by doing proper research. 

2.) Even if you believe in efficient markets, that doesn't mean beating the market is impossible. It just means you likely have to take on more risk to do it. It might work, it might not. Higher risk is rewarded with higher returns, so if you're okay with the added risk, there's the possibility of making more money (ideally with at least some divetsification).

3.) People often misunderstand the role of entities like hedge funds and other pro money managers. I worked at a large hedge fund (not as a trader) and we rarely beat the S&P 500 in a given year in total return lol. Clients for hedge funds often are wealthy individuals or others such as pension funds who simply want a reasonable return that isn't 100% correlated with the market, so if the S&P tanks they don't lose everything. Some do take on a ton of risk, but they usually blow up within a few years. The ones that stay around generally have higher Sharpe ratios than the broader market, but in total returns they often lag, yet they still have clients because the goal isn't always to just beat the market. Their strategies can also sometimes be constrained by a large AUM. With less capital, you can actually take on different strategies than the pros are able to and it's entirely possible for these strategies to do well.",Dolos2279,2,/r/investing/comments/obnprd/what_are_your_best_12_line_counters_to_the_advice/h3payoi/,0.088,0.813,0.099,0.7514

131,DD," You should be able to tell rather quickly whether you outperform indexes because of a few lucky picks or because >50% of your portfolio that outperforms indexes still gives you more alpha on your total returns than if you had the benchmark indexes. 


If you choose to spend minutes a week reading about things and you know that more than that is boring and tiresome then you should be like a successful gambler and go into much more safe investments such as indexes right away.


If you are happy for the rest of your investing career doing DD and keeping up with the macro trends as well as the individual stocks you pick and you see good returns then keep on going. 


You don't just get an inborn talent for investing and outperform the market because you are intelligent. It takes strategy that mitigates for risk. It takes commitment. It requires mastering your emotions so that your excellent strategy is actually followed. 

Since 2020 and probably over the next several years there will be a large number of people figuring out that just because they started investing in the spring of 2020 and buying EV and Crypto doesn't mean their gains are invulnerable from losses.

142,CS," The hedge funds that try to beat the market and all the active mutual fund managers that also try to beat the market generally fail to beat the market **AFTER fees**.

The truth is, beating the market is very difficult in a risk adjusted manner.

&#x200B;

There are other ways to have greater returns while underperforming the market. Generally, the answer to that lies in... borrowing other people's money (leverage) and praying you don't get a LTCM or Bill Hwang moment.

&#x200B;

[https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/research-insights/spiva/](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/research-insights/spiva/)

SPIVA evidences the active mutual fund managers that are benchmarked against their respective index to see what percent actually beats the benchmark after fees.

The truth is, the numbers are horrible.

My father, who has been in this field his entire life, isn't hesitant to admit that beating the index after fees is extremely difficult.

And I too who worked at Wall Street out of college (graduated from Ivy League with CS, Math) understand how difficult it is to beat the market long term. The future is a mystery. It could have been likely covid could have crashed the US Market for years. No one can be sure of anything of the future.

That said, I do invest both passive and active. Passive indexes is my 'serious retirement money' and active is cause... everyone likes to believe he/she is above average ;)

Mathematically, 'only invest in index funds' has been the ideal approach long term for most Americans. So it's really hard to refute that statement. I don't like dealing with absolutes but if an average American wanted to maximize his/her chances of making money, indexing has been the most sound approach.

197,RMD," David, as others have said, there is no way to avoid the RMD.  But it is not like you are  losing real money.  I have accounts with ML/BOA.  I am 70, so I have not been required yet to do an RMD.  But talking to my advisor, when I do, I can do a direct transfer of dollars or stocks from my IRA directly to my brokerage account.  That transfer will show as a distribution and will be taxable.  But (a) the RMD amount/holdings are still in an account you own, and (b) the tax consequence is $0 if you are still less than the standard deductible, to very little if it does push you above the standard.

I read an article recently about FLPs (Family Limited Partnerships), which may reduce the tax implications of wealth transfer, but just doing a little research, the costs and complexity to set one up would not likely be beneficial for all but the very wealthy.

Bottom line, have another conversation with your advisor and see if you have the option to transfer to a new or existing account.  And if you use a tax tool like Turbo Tax, they have a tool to allow you to forecast next years taxes, where you can include the RMD and see the forecasted impact, if any!  Good discussion from all.

200,IMO," ITOT + IXUS is IMO a much better choice than AOA.

ITOT is essentially the same as VTI or SCHB.  Each of those are total US market index funds, just using different index providers (S&P, MSCI, or Russell).  Very high correlation, but just different enough that a simultaneous sell of one and a buy of the other is not a wash sale.    

Same for VXUS and IXUS, as total international index ETFs.
If you wanted to split that into developed and emerging, the the ETFs to use are VEA, SCHG, and IEFA for developed and VWO, SPEM, and IEMG for emerging.

Anything you read is Bogleheads Reddit about VTI and VXUS applies equally to ITOT and IXUS.

I would just have an emergency fund of 6 months expenses as your fixed income allocation, then put the rest 100% in ITOT and IXUS.   If you wanted more stability, then add another 6 months or 12 months of expenses in BND or the equivalent iShares.  A shorter duration such as an intermediate bond fund will have lower returns, but less volatility.   

The exact VTI/VXUS or ITOT/IXUS ratio is debated hotly, with some saying 55 Us 45% international since that is how the world market cap is distributed.  I prefer to have a bit of a home bias of 75/25 ITOT/IXUS.

212,IMO," I am personally all in, but very much like u/dvdmovie1 said, I am looking at least one year out on the investment.  Does every investment do what I want? no.  Do I take losses as well as gains?  yes.  The macro IMO is that we are in the final third of a very long bull market.  There was no change of market leadership with the Covid pullback which makes that, regardless of how people want to classify it based on magnitude, a massive correction because that is what it behaved like.  Will there be more corrections in the bull?  probably.  does anyone know when they will happen?  no.  we just came out of a tech correction that lasted about 4 months that went along with a counter value rotation -- so my thesis is we are seeing secular corrections now rather than wholesale; obviously that can change too.  Will the bear show up tomorrow?  probably not, the level of sentiment, while frothy, doesn't look like unbridled enthusiasm.  How much cash you leave on the sideline is up to you, but you also need discipline to decide to deploy it.  if it just always sits on the sidelines it is nothing but drag.  since you are mid 30s your timeline is 30+ years!  plenty of time for the market to provide you with happy returns regardless of the short term.

If you move your money in over a period of a couple of months or a quarter, you will probably see dips to buy and it may make you feel better to have a plan and to use some discipline in following it.  So I would recommend setting a plan and using limit orders (below market) to buy in.  see how that goes... 3-5% moves are well within normal volatility.  if you want to hold out a chunk for a big down move like 15% plus, then that is a plan to catch a correction.  the key is to have a plan and follow it.

Just keep rolling it down the line and you'd have your initial investment covered in less than a year, assuming IV and interest stays high.  I get what you mean by not caring so much about the long-term value, as long as volatility stays high and you keep writing ccs, you'll eventually make it back.

221,OR," what is it with this forum and WSB. You guys mention it so much, I've only made one thread here asking one question and I've heard WSB I don't know how many times. 

And no, you're wrong, it's absolutely correct that you don't lose any money if you still retain your shares. if the stock plummets 20%, you'll profit months later if it rebounds and goes up 50% from where it was. That principle will remain true if your ""portfolio valuation"" declines x percent as it dropped. Why is it that investors will double down on a stock when it drops 10, 20%, right so they can lose more money to save their 'portfolio valuation', OR MAYBE they're averaging down to control more shares, taking correct advantage of the market. 

Please stop wasting your time referring everyone you don't agree with to WSB, we know you're clearly so much more knowledgeable and soooo above everyone else.",letheocean,-1,/r/investing/comments/ob9ey9/i_have_5k_to_spend_on_a_stock_in_order_to_sell/h3mx33r/,0.07,0.787,0.143,0.895
