25,DD," For one thing, their institutional ownership isn't nearly that high.  Maybe 20% or so, having taken a quick glance at the 13F values on Fintel and knowing they have about a billion shares outstanding.  There might be more institutional ownership in the form of warrants, but those don't reduce the size of the float (if they were ever exercised, that would issue new shares.)

Warrants are a double edged sword.  You might think it means the hedge funds want the stock to go up, but in reality they often use them as a hedge to protect a short position - more on that here: [The curse of the poor capital structure](https://magazine.wharton.upenn.edu/digital/the-curse-of-the-poor-capital-structure/)

All that said, the lineup of funds currently holding shares seem pretty legit, as opposed to the ones involved last year.  But a lot of these funds don't buy because they're necessarily bullish on a given stock.  Funds like Blackrock and Vanguard have index funds which are literally intended to track a segment of the market, or even the entire market.  If my numbers are right, about 25m ZOM shares are in Vanguard's total market index (VTI.) The reason they added so much in the last half a year or so, is because the stock's market cap grew dramatically so the stock is literally a bigger component of the market.  So index sampling ETF's seek more exposure to it.  These funds also have super low fees, such that you can bet the addition of shares is based on an automated process rather than any form of DD.  Some of the funds there very well may be selective and bullish based on DD, I'm just speaking to some common, major institutional holders.

That's the glass half empty side of it.  The positive side is that these tutes usually don't sell.  They're not bagholders; they aren't waiting for a certain price point to get out.  So it is meaningful in terms of reducing the float, and minimizing potential sell offs.",stompingllama,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/nf8qjb/zom_has_high_institutional_ownership_read_this_is/gym3iw3/,0.045,0.834,0.122,0.9787

27,PT," That is pretty interesting, I never thought about checking the mkt cap and this 200m revenue lol. 

In your opinion is $15 too high? I typically look at the 1, and 5 year trend and pick a PT based on this (assuming normal operations) but I‚Äôve never really experienced news or something like this, where I‚Äôm in before the news. 

Idk if you‚Äôre holding or swing trading this stock ($2.8-5 swings) I had a PT of $5 until I saw this news.

28,PT," I didn't know anything about this stock until I saw this post and looked up the info. I'm not holding or swing trading. 

Congrats on getting in before big news! I can't really tell you a PT about a company I know nothing about. I think it all depends on your personal investment style. What percent gains do you shoot for? Depending on how comfortable you are, how many shares you have and at what average, you could sell off your initial investments worth and let the profits ride. There's always that nagging thought of ""damn I could have made x instead of y"" if you had held it all, but there's always a chance it tanks and you're left lamenting not taking gains. It's up to you, but no one ever went broke taking profit.
