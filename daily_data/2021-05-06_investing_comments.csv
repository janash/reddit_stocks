0,ITT," Automation is in the way. It won't be half the cost, as others ITT have speculated. 

Uber could just easily prioritize self driven vehicles though.

A message prompt like ""Ken A. can be there in his 2008 Nissan Ultima in 15 mintues or an automated UberDrives vehicle could be there in 6 minutes. Which would you prefer?""

Uber can do this by intentionally delaying jobs for human drivers. As in we'd eventually hear about drivers trailing self driving cars and proving the delay exist, it being called unethical, etc, etc.

And once it starts to take off, Uber can start to develop ads to get people to prefer the self driven cars by framing them as more safe for women.

Imagine a commercial that starts out ""At Uber, we strive to make sure our employees meet our company guidelines for what a driver should be. It is our biggest challenge."" and then, in black and white, show a woman in the back of an Uber clearly uncomfortable with the male driver. His eyes leering back at her through the rear view mirror. She just wants a ride home and now she just wants to make it out of this human driven vehicle! They can basically all but call their employees rapists.

Commercial then shifts to color. The same woman is smiling as she bounds out of work into her humanless UberDrives self driven vehicle. ""UberDrives. Clean. Safe. Yours."" 

Drivers that take issue with the ad, we'll they're just upset women want to feel safe. So, something must be wrong with them, right?

Eventually they ad a feature to the app where you can toggle select to ""Hire UberDrives only"".",Fruhmann,-4,/r/investing/comments/n5z0z4/uber_investors_finally_see_the_costs_of_treating/gx4ng0z/,0.064,0.847,0.09,0.7075

So why am I scared now? Cause a pe of 500 if INSANE. Its slowly sinking in. I am young so don't mind holding them for a few more years. But have learnt a lesson for sure. If something has gone up incredibly in a short time and has triple digit pe, be very wary. Keep it in the watchlist or may be even add a limit buy order. It inevitably corrects once those who bought low start selling.

Their business model did not evolve, their platform did not evolve beyond some small changes here and there. The new features they're planning now is the first time they actually try to add anything new. It's a not so great company and the stock price reflects that.

PLTR getting ""multi-million contracts"" is like pennies to a company of that size. The stock price was highly overvalued already and when the lockup period ended they rightfully sold a lot of shares back into the market. It's a far-out-future thing and if you want to profit from them you should think longer than a few months. More like a few years at least.

51,PLTR, PLTR has fallen victim to the Reddit “everything that happens is good news for the stock” phenomenon. Did you know that PLTR was incorporated in 2003? It’s almost 20 years old and still has yet to hit profitability. Those huge multimillion dollar contracts? When you actually read the details they’re not that big. The last one I saw was being touted as an 89 million dollar huge deal but when you actually read the specifics only 9 million is guaranteed. Government contracts are reliable but they’re the opposite of explosive growth that you see in the private sector. PLTR is selling off because it got overheated by the Reddit crowd and then reality sets in. I believe in its long term potential but short to medium? Expect a continued downwards slide.,dal2k305,1,/r/investing/comments/n6dh3d/i_sold_every_share_i_own_today/gx72jid/,0.033,0.887,0.08,0.7461

53,SQ," You found your investment style that suits you in the S&P 500.

Some food for thought you didn't ask for but you put it in a public forum so here you go:

You were lucky enough to get in on one of the steepest bull runs in history. The problem is, you didn't know it. The painful lesson you just learned is market conditions and context. You don't get better at something by being successful, you get better by getting kicked in your nuts and figuring out how not to have it happen again. Investing is never safe - there are people who invested in the S&P 500 in 2000 who saw no gains by the end of 2010.

It's a good step to acknowledge the things you don't understand. TWTR isn't worth anymore today than it was in 2013 because they never executed a profit driving business model. Jack Dorsey's other company, SQ, has. It also sounds like you tried to keep using the stuff that previously worked (tech and growth stocks) and kept going back to the well even after the market told you that wasn't going to work anymore. I learned more about market rotation in the last 6 months than I ever have before - but I am now a better trader because of it. A couple months ago I decided that I was going to take my medicine and become the trader I used to make fun of - I bought oil, infrastructure and steel stocks. They have been appreciating while my tech has been dying.

At the end of the day you're the only person who has to live with your decisions so whatever maximizes your happiness and makes you the best version of yourself is what you should do. Investing is a passion for me and I enjoy it. If it's not for you then don't. If it still interests you but you've had enough - take a breather, spend the time reading on the educational side of it, not the individual stock picking side. I recommend A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton Malkiel. It is a very digestible book on how different markets function together and will give you a perspective of what's happening to make you feel more informed and in control about your trades.

55,TSLA," Literally just buy VOO index of SP500 companies and DCA into it over time.

Then you can spend your sunny days outside enjoying them while earning about 8% per year on average. With indexes you can just buy and hold without having a 80% drawdown.

Stop stock picking, start indexing. You get decent return and spend no time thinking about it.

&#x200B;

If you stock pick like you did you should have price targets per company and buy/sell based on it.

If you really think $SQ will grow into a pe of 600 with multiple competitors in USA and many others across the World, buy in. But don't argue that that's what would need to happen for SQ to grow into that pe ratio over years without any increase in stock price.

It's a lesson that gets learned by new waves of investors every time there is a hyped sector. Despite it happening every few years, it never stops and most novice investors never bother to learn before dumping their $ into the markets. Congrats on using this as a learning event. If beating the stock market over the long run was as easy  as the hordes of new covid-era investors would have had people believe over the last year, everyone would be warren buffett.

The reality is, the wave of new investors with stimmy checks all herded into what waves of new investors almost always herd into: innovative technology. And ARKK was the obvious case for that. Once it started to outperform a little bit, that caused more and more of these new investors to start chasing the performance. And thus a bubble started to form.

In other words, the success of the fund and the stocks in the ARK indexes were simply a product of a stampede of people all buying the same thing at the same time (IE an influx of liquidity) without any real care about fundamentals.

i still hold those shares but i also hold shares of companies which i belive will have a bright future like the EV sector, therapeutical- and surveilance sector.

my whole portfolio is red at the moment. i thought i bought dips but it kept dipping...


do i just hold indefinately now?

i just want to raise my net worth.

89,PLTR," Yep, volatility has been really good.
I've also been  mostly selling CSPs on PLTR while the IV was crazy high and picking up shares on the way down. I will be doing that until I reach 100 shares, so i can sell CCs and hopefully let those grow for the next few years. 
All said and done, 100 shares of PLTR isn't much in the grand scheme of things, but it is what allows me to play with my strategies, turn a worthy profit over a few years if everything goes according to plans, while still, unlike OP, sleep at night because it's an amount I'm comfortable sitting on a somewhat risky stock.",DrLongIsland,4,/r/investing/comments/n6dh3d/i_sold_every_share_i_own_today/gx6w2ll/,0.028,0.743,0.229,0.969

93,GME," Hey, I totally feel you because this is me at 38. I really think the stock market is a shock to people my age and younger, where we are so used to having things gamified. By that I mean I put time/money into it, I definitely get rewarded. My character levels up if I put time into them, even faster if I spend money. If I put my knowledge and money and invest it, it should be just like that. Maybe there's some short-term setbacks but all the wealthy make their money in the stock market, it's just a matter of money + time. Well, it's going to be a lot of time sometimes.

When it was 2013, I was an MBA student and did a competitive analysis on Tesla Motors. All the expert consensus material I was reading said that it was an over-valued automaker that lost money (lols, it still sorta is is 8 years later). I didn't think that at all, I thought it was a must-buy once in a decade opportunity. And the rest of the auto-makers we're going to be following Tesla.

It was. But if I'd gone out and put my money where my mouth is, here's what I would have seen. And I totally would have watched the price action on the daily.

The stock would have dropped down right away, I would have been underwater for four months before breaking even. It would have gone up +30%, then plummeted back down and by 1.5 years later it would have come back down to my original cost basis. Feb 2016 I would have been under-water again. Christmas 12/16 breaking even again  (Over 3 years now in this stupid stock).

June 2019 would have been the last time the stock went back down to my original cost basis (About then the short attack finally ended). Some investor who didn't know anything about Tesla in June 2019 could have made just as much money off what I'd seen almost 6 years earlier because of the way the market works. They would have potentially done better because they didn't have to ride the turbulence all that time, and endure the short attacks.

I don't have the patience to wait that long, not yet, especially now that I'm older. And GME has made that problem worse because now you're all caught up in the moment and it's exciting and you're waiting for a short-squeeze now for months, and it's any day now. You need that drip drip of reward to leave that money alone. Maybe the short-squeeze isn't going to happen. Maybe something else in the market stops it from ever happening, and the price drops to 120, then 100, then 80, then 60, then it stays around there maybe up to 70 but back down to 60 for two years. Stellar earnings each quarter and you get so excited each time, but the price drops, and you don't understand why. The rest of the market doesn't seem to care about your brick-and-morter video game mall store and it's ""smoke and mirrors"" (WSJ quote) online pivot.

Maybe you try to keep the excitement up with options trading. After a couple of years you haven't earned any money just hodling. Timing the market is impossible, and if you micromanage, you lose money.

You try options trading and it's exciting, until you realize short-term options trading is basically gambling, but advanced options trading hurts your head, and long-term options trading is like paying money to find out in a couple of years that you were wrong, and now you don't even own shares.

So you decide, ""This sucks, my ""aggressive"" 401K in the S&P 500 does better than I do actively managing my portfolio. Let's just do that, and collect our 8% annual average because even thought I was right about Tesla/GME waiting years through pain and ups and downs sucked, and all my picks have had mixed results. I don't want to deal with it anymore, because all the time I spent researching and actively managing my portfolio for years was hours and hours I could have spent doing something else.

115,FCF," Approving the comment but with some guidance:  Even though the stock is undervalued, I encourage you to come to the table with a more thorough analysis.  A thorough discussion of valuation is going to do more than look at various ratios of earnings.  For example:

1. What's the FCF-based fair value?
2. What's the delta of Ford's forward P/E in each of the past five quarters to its actual P/E?  In other words, how much did positive earnings materialize into stock price appreciation?
3. What is the historical and forward P/E comparison to Ford's peers?  The automotive industry is exceptionally capital intensive with not staggeringly high margins.
4. What are the risk factors unique to the automotive industry?  Investors have been as shy of automotive stocks as they have been of airline stocks, two industries that required a LOT of public subsidy over the past five decades, and are now facing a transformation challenge: spurred on by the $2 billion settlement of VW AG over its emissions scandals, automotive makers have an incentive to convert their production to EV's but at what cost?  Is Ford ahead or behind its peers in this regard?
5. There's not a lot in their financial statements that looks glaringly bad (some commentary on non cash items, discontinued operations and capital lease obligations is welcome but not materially significant) but a few things should be at least commented on including that three of the past five quarters they posted a net operating loss... Granted, that owes to the pandemic but when we look at history, even before the pandemic the stock price never rose above $14 per share and hovered for quite a while around $10, currently trading at $11.5399.  So the market's not really moved the price even remotely close to the FCF fair value in the last half decade... What implications might that have for the expected return?  That may or may not matter depending on the type of value investor you're pitching the question to, but it's got to be addressed so they can weigh it.

There are, I'm sure, many other questions that can be raised if given more than the five or six minutes I glanced at the company's data... This is just an example of the kind of questions you should anticipate.",th3cr1t1c,1,/r/investing/comments/n5yd5o/am_i_missing_something_or_is_f_massively/gx5iiqs/,0.037,0.851,0.113,0.9856
116,ICE," Investing in the value factor involves buying the cheapest section of the market in terms of a value metric such as PE, and has historically outperformed the market. Ford is definitely a candidate investment for this type of factor strategy, given its low PE.

When you study the source of returns in this style of value factor investing, it boils down to investors fleeing companies that are short term declining, and then catching the wave of “investor re-rating” when the company gets back on track and investors pile back onto it.

Therefore the fundamental question is not whether Ford has a low PE, but will it get back on track and experience the re-rating? Even getting back to the SP500 average PE would roughly 3x your investment, which is very appealing.

However, for now I’m still in the bear camp. I think ICE cars are not a market you can expect to be growing in the long term, and I’ve not seen any signs yet that Ford is going to survive the jump to EV. It could be a “value trap”, aka something that never gets back on track and sucks in investors with appealing metrics but poor long term performance.

Then again, I’m not exactly paying attention to their offerings. If they showed a compelling EV model on the horizon, that could definitely be the kind of thing that kicks off bringing the stock back around.",vansterdam_city,8,/r/investing/comments/n5yd5o/am_i_missing_something_or_is_f_massively/gx4bqw6/,0.043,0.896,0.061,0.34

118,DCF," There is no magic ratio that will tell you what investments to make.

You can use ratios to help you decide HOW to craft a story and model value.

For example, if a company has a low P/E and growing revenue - it may be a good candidate for a two-stage DCF valuation. Usually a company in a mature industry with declining growth rates.

What these ratios don’t tell you is the risk of total disruption. What if you believe Ford is going to be worthless in 10 years because they have failed to make adequate investments in electric vehicles? Then the stock should be worth close to $0 today no matter what the ratios are.

140,WFC," There could be a number of things including:

* **UNDERLYING VALUE.** The underlying value Berkshire has to Warren is higher than to his wife. Not only sentimental value, but real total value. Warren is an insider who actively looks after and influences the decisions of Berkshire. His (1st or 2nd) wife might not have that investing experience, sway in the company, or likely that business/finance/accounting acumen to oversee the company and shares. Or even if she did, she might not always be of good health to do the constant homework on the company.

* **S&P500 are fixed**. I'm not saying BRK is better or worse than the VOO/SPY. Both have their advantages and both are awesome. However, BRK is run by a few individuals making decisions. Most hedgefund managers don't beat the S&P and even savvy investors can make mistakes (like selling airlines at the bottom, dumping WFC at the bottom, and holding cash instead of buying the dip despite [being the face of ""buying the dip""](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ilxnwo/yes/) rather than going all-in and leveraging up like degens on WSB). Per the last point, his wifey might not know what's going wrong, if there is fraud, if they are making risky bets, or doing poorly. The S&P500 is more ""causal proof"" in that it just sets itself against the index. There is still risks of misconduct and fraud, but at the very least the stock picks are locked, there won't be Archegos-type leveraging, and management fees are clearly shown.

* **Diversification**. Why have only BRK when you can have a bit more diversification by having both?

TL;DR Warren & Munger ""Our wives are filthy casuals""",zxc123zxc123,5,/r/investing/comments/n69kpo/long_term_expectations_of_berkshire_growth/gx60ird/,0.1,0.783,0.118,0.5528
141,AMZN," I think the ideal way to explain the difference between BRK and an index fund would be to look at the story of Amazon in 1999-2000.:

In 1999 AMZN was worth $100/share. One year later at the end of 2000 it was worth $10/share. What is interesting about this is that while the market valued amazon at 90%, Amazon the business was totally kicking ass, growing by leaps and bounds and demonstrating  the ability to turn a profit in the immediate future (with the company doing just that at the end of 2001).

What this teaches us is that companies that are well run and profitable and managed rationally can produce large profits even in market downturns. This is why you would want to buy Berkshire over an index: for wealth protection when the market isnt in crazy bull mode. Now Berkshire does not pay a dividend and they historically never have but that does not mean they \*couldnt\*. If we have lets say a very long term bear market, Berkshires holdings will continue to make profits and while those profits will most likely be used to buy back stock or just be redeployed back into the businesses but the \*value\* is there and if the market does not respect that increased value (by bidding up the share price) then they could pay dividends to give investors some cash flow. You buy Berkshire for their ability to pivot and be a sensible investment even when things arent great but even when they are great they will also make money. Contrast this with an index like SPY. Sure the top companies could all do the same things in a downturn but its a lot of companies with all different management so you cant really count on a monolithic and rational response.

The TL;DR is buy BRK if you want to be in the best risk adjusted position for an equity investment especially if you think a downturn is coming. your return will (likely) be less during the crazy bull market but not by much and especially over long term.",robotlasagna,2,/r/investing/comments/n69kpo/long_term_expectations_of_berkshire_growth/gx62vky/,0.05,0.781,0.169,0.985

It's extremely inflationary. There's no utility to it. The parabolic run-up looks like a typical pump-and-dump, which is basically when a token gets hype and the value goes up, and then the old guard takes their profits and bails. The newcomers are left holding the bag as the value plummets. I personally think this is going to happen, and you're much more likely to see Doge at a nickel before Doge at a dollar.

That's just my opinion though. My only real advice is to make sure that you won't miss the cash you do put towards the cause. Consider it a complete loss when you buy in. If you're not OK with losing it all, you might want to look at a safer play like ETH or BTC.

https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target-2/

First off their ""bull case"" assumes its possible for them to achieve $327 billion in JUST robo-taxi revenue (a non-existent technology) by 2025! That is more revenue than Apple makes selling all their products and services. Where do they think that money would come from? That is like 30x what Uber currently brings in. If it was even possible to make like 1/2 of that, why would Tesla even be selling cars in the first place? Why not just run the fleet of taxis?
Here is a video of saying that Tesla would have FOR SURE 1 million robo-taxis on the road by last year:

**Tesla reported no autonomous testing on California’s public roads during in 2020 to the CA DMV:**
https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/disengagement-reports/

What a joke...

Ok now for their ""bear case""...
This involves the projection of Tesla achieving $42 billion in human driven ride hailing revenue (4x what uber makes now). Ya, not happening. Also, creating a $23 billion insurance business out of thin air. Progressive Insurance for reference, has a revenue of $40 billion or so revenue, which took them many decades to build. Here is an expert in insurance valuation and founder of Semper Augustus hedge fund Chris Bloomstran, explaining how idiotic this projection is: https://tweet.lambda.dance/ChrisBloomstran/status/1373410803559321614

224,ATH," Currently  down on BB 40% and ARK funds anywhere between 20-30%. I understand that  BB is a very longterm play and I had originally purchased it with that intention but at the price and quantity I bought in at  it doesn't seem like it's worth holding onto it for years and years to  maybe break even (the stock needs to go up 67% for the breakeven point!). I don't have the cash or the conviction to average down either.

ARK  is a slightly different case. I had originally purchased them with the  intention of holding on for at least a few years, but I ended up purchasing way too much and at the ATH. It currently makes up half my  portfolio (yeah...) and I'd really like to drop it down to 15-20% at most.

I  fear that I'm going to miss out on any economic recovery with so much  of my money tied up in BB and ARK.

225,BB," Currently  down on BB 40% and ARK funds anywhere between 20-30%. I understand that  BB is a very longterm play and I had originally purchased it with that intention but at the price and quantity I bought in at  it doesn't seem like it's worth holding onto it for years and years to  maybe break even (the stock needs to go up 67% for the breakeven point!). I don't have the cash or the conviction to average down either.

ARK  is a slightly different case. I had originally purchased them with the  intention of holding on for at least a few years, but I ended up purchasing way too much and at the ATH. It currently makes up half my  portfolio (yeah...) and I'd really like to drop it down to 15-20% at most.

229,UK," Hi,

I’m currently a student teacher in the UK but unfortunately it’s not been working out so I have a lot of free time at the moment. I’ve wanted to get into trading to learn something and hopefully make a career out of it. I’ve been researching close to a week now and I’ve hit a point where Im unsure and need some guidance.

I have set up a crytoaltum account with 5:1 leverage and deposited $50 in BTC and aim to trade BTC/USD using mt5. I would like to try out a scalping strategy that I have had success with on a demo account.

My aim is to risk go long/short with $1 worth at a time. I know this is a small amount but it’s all I can afford to lose at the moment and I would love to get some practice with real money.

When I open the trade the lowest volume I can enter is 0.01 BTC. I don’t want to make a trade yet because I’m worried that this will be risking my entire balance in one trade.

My balance in the account is 0.0015507 BTC; equity is 0.00173261; credit 0.00057754; free margin 0.00173261.

Is it possible to open a new order by placing down $1 each trade or do I have to do something else that I’m currently unaware of. Like increase my leverage to 500. At which point if I enter a short trade am I open to get into debt? Or another solution would it be possible to trade something other than BTC/USD because a single micro unit volume of BTC/USD is too high for my balance?

I feel like I’m very much misunderstanding something here and would greatly appreciate some guidance. I posted on r/cryptocurrencytrading earlier and I’m waiting for a response. Thought I’d ask here too. Many thanks in advance.",iraiyanar,1,/r/investing/comments/n62ybe/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gx4to9p/,0.09,0.75,0.16,0.9795

We have been in a slump about 5 years ago but the stock price has since doubled and recent earnings reports have been great, riding the wave of 5g. Is there any calculation or formula out there that will either tell me which portion of my salary I should invest in this scheme to compare my risks and returns vs traditional single index strategies; or a way to calculate the risk that the stock will lose 50% of its value thus starting to lose me money on this ""investment"" scheme?

240,IMO," > can wait 2-3 years 

Tbf, this is not a time horizon that is great for investing. Doing the maths, and using past data, 10 years will give you 99% sure a gain on your investment, 6 years has already a good chance of doing so (IMO), but anything less is a gamble. Say the market doesn't crash, but looses a bit and then staying flat for 2 years. You might break even in the third year, but then keeping the cash in your bank account would have done the same.   
Basically, the shorter your timeframe is, the more you are moving from investing towards short-term trading, with all the risk that entails.   


Over 2-3 years, I woulnd'n bet on index/mutual funds being much better than doing nothing.    


This is all without looking at the current market or its future. Given its current state, i.e. its votality and sensibiity to pandemic news, this also could loose you money. I see the risk greater than the reward here, tbh.   


>  would the Govt actually allow it to crash very far? 

Noone knows how far we can manipulate the market without causing greater problems. Even a small crash could take time to recover from though, time that might be greater than 3 years.  


> If a crash does happen, what would be affected most in your eyes

249,FCF," Valuing a company is always personal, it is about what and where you see the company going in your eyes and then transforming this into numbers.

Now you talk about valuing a company, FCF and market ratios in the same sentence, but market ratios refer to what the market values a company at, and that is already reflected in the stock price (pricing).

So do you want to price your company or value it (intrinsic value)? And to me it sounds like you want somebody else to do that for you (asking for a tool), but keep in mind that valuations reflect personal projections and can vary heavily based on whoever or whatever valued it.

Have interest rates changed? 

Have inflation numbers changed?

Have global tax rates changed?

my perspective is that until interest rates change in the US, most assets will continue to do well. Although, the new tax rates are concerning, I think they're offset by the amount of asset inflation that has occurred as a result of the money printing around the world. Because some crypto has deflationary protocols built into their economics, this money printing doubly enhances the growth of crypto, which provides downside risk protection in the event that interest rates must be moved up unexpectedly.

262,PTON, They have their earnings after the market shuts tonight- I bought a few shares yesterday but I admit I’m nervous for these earnings. Definitely feels like PTON is a gamble at the moment,EDTG_,1,/r/investing/comments/n6cwq4/time_to_buy_pton_or_wait/gx6cgh9/,0.071,0.644,0.285,0.7876
