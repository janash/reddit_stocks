3,WF," No, it had to do with their mismanagement and defrauding customers where they created multiple accounts in customers' names unbeknownst to the customer, to basically game their frontline compensation models... and management knew and didn't discourage it.

Buffett was absolutely furious at senior managers because it was completely avoidable.  I moved my banking over to Schwab from WF years ago because I was fed up with their poor handling of some very basic customer service issues (not directly related to this scandal).

EDIT: While the shares were sold over a period of time, it's important to note that Berkshire Hathaway prior to 2017 owned 500 million shares of Wells Fargo, or about 12% making them the single largest shareholder.  Any sudden paring of the majority of those shares would create a shockwave across the market.

Per Eric Platt, [""Buffett dumps bulk of his remaining Wells Fargo shares""](https://www.ft.com/content/e8f9c368-2a3c-490e-a289-ec8a1216f943), *Financial Times*:

>After the revelations first came to light, Buffett said that Wells was “a great bank that made a terrible mistake” and he championed the executive changes the San Francisco-based lender had planned. But as the controversy deepened, his commitment to Wells waned, and in 2017 he criticised management for not intervening sooner to limit the scandal.

Currency worries: 40% monetary debasement with trillions more to come, negative real yields, negative rates on some savings accounts, bank seizures like Cypress and Hong Kong, exploding sovereign debt

Macro forces: There's over 100T in bonds, 30T of which with negative real yield, whose principle is at risk as rates rise (a bond with 10y duration will lose 10% each percent). Enter an asset that doesn't debase, does great in inflation, is moderately uncorrelated, and is easy to custody that's only bid up to 0.8T and you have extreme asymmetric upside. 

Debt trap: With the explosion in debt (and trillions more coming) the government owes $280B/year for each percent increase. If it got to 4% that'd be the equivalent of paying for a second US military. The government can't afford to let rates get that high and will have to implement some level of yield curve control which ultimately means dollar debasement. 

Sovereignty: Self custody optionality, no counterparty risk, 24/7 access, borderless, decentralized, publicly auditable. 

Yield: Blockfi, staking, and defi offer yields that absolutely crush savings accounts.

32,HD," Following the Q1 financial results, Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel has reiterated a Hold rating on the stock. According to the analyst, normalization in spending trends as COVID-19 effects subside could continue to weigh heavily on sales and growth at the home improvement company.  
Nagel believes investors should be cautious, as Home Depot's comparable stores are facing significant challenges.  
“We look very favorably upon today’s report from HD and view the company's recent sales and profit strength as another clear signal of underlying operating prowess at the chain and of management's ability to capitalize well on continued COVID-19-related upheaval in the broader consumer landscape,” Nagel wrote in a research note to investors.  
He continued, ""We recommend clients remain on the sidelines with HD, at least for now, particularly as comparisons for the chain are turning significantly more challenging.""

52,ATH," OK, but it seems to me from your limited comments here that you are trying to apply maxims from **passive,** broad-based index investing (e.g. investing in SPY or VTSAX) to actively managed strategies that only focus on a very specific subset of companies, many of which have very similar metrics.

In other words ARK isn't ""the market."" And by choosing to invest in ARK, you are in many ways timing the market by choosing a certain set of stocks over others, and by having an active manager (Wood) try to time the market on your behalf with buy/sell decisions. 

Look at it this way; value investing, a style that encompasses a far broader set of stocks than ARK has been out of favor for almost two decades now, so the idea that you are owed a fresh ATH this year or even within 5 years is dubious based on what we know about investing styles going in and out of favor...to say nothing of ""hot"" actively managed fund strategies.",Striking-Conflict-41,3,/r/investing/comments/ngv5u5/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gyunpiz/,0.031,0.839,0.13,0.9522

56,VERY," There's a lot of poor economic theory, praxxing, and conspiracy that gets used when making the arguments in favor of physical metals as an investment -- ignore it, it is 99% complete bologna. 

I used to invest in physical silver. I still have some. It's pretty neat to have a couple of bars and shiney coins, but that's basically where the benefits stop. Physical PMs are a pain in the ass to transact in -- bid / ask spreads are VERY wide at local dealers and at big online retailers. In order to get good execution you almost always have to sell online which takes time and effort (meeting people from craigslist, taking risks mailing money and metals through the mail, or driving to meet people at banks). Running eBay auctions put you at risk during bouts of volatility as auctions take days to complete. Moving houses or apartments with a bunch of bars and tubes of silver was also kind of a pain. Depending on how big your stack is / gets storage can become an issue too.

In hindsight I quickly regretted going the bullion route. SLV is just so much easier. The one exception is if you're going the buillion route because you like the collecting aspect of things (think numismatics, buying rounds or bars with historical context or interesting artwork), but if this is your M.O. then you're not really investing, but rather pursuing a hobby.

57,OUT," Silver is more common. Thus developed more common uses, is more readily used, and more commonly traded. Gold is less common so is runs opposite of that. 

Some would say silver is different has more industrial uses, but I largely argue that it's the other way around. If you can use something like copper/silver to mimic even 90% of the utility of gold then you wouldn't use gold in that process/item unless it's specifically to drive up value cost. The reason is because gold costs more. Gold costs more because it's rarer and harder to obtain. 

So it keeps boiling down to gold's rarity, availability, and costs to procure.

>I literally just cannot understand why any small personal investor would want to buy silver bullion when gram for gram there is the far more efficient option of gold?

As FP said, silver is more common than gold so it's more accessible and ends up having more liquidity and uses than gold. It's not the whole case, but if you want to simplify it then that's mostly the reason. For smaller investors BRK-B exists because they can't buy BRK-A.

Other investors choose to short the rarity of gold and commonness of silver. For example, the historic silver:gold ratio has been throw stray recently because the advent of electric vehicles and role silver plays in the batteries. Is it because gold can't be used? No. But humans never bothered to make disposable gold batteries because that would be expensive and stupid. The opposite is true, humans actively try to remove silver OUT of batteries if possible and use cheaper materials like lithium/alkaline. But some investors might choose silver/copper because they are bullish on the economy but choose gold's stability if they believe the economy might be questionable or bearish.",zxc123zxc123,3,/r/investing/comments/nh2dd4/what_exactly_is_the_point_in_investing_in_silver/gyukfdh/,0.032,0.872,0.096,0.9547

And of course it’s value is measured in the currency of whatever nation you reside.  Cash is still king and how else would we be able to assign a value to it?

64,IMO," 1) Yes forward looking statements are part of it however often times in an annual report they will explain what makes a business unit profitable and what possible events would lead to better or worse performance in the future. Try to see if any of those events have occurred and if management was correct in their hypothesis. This shows a sound understanding of the business. 

2) I would replace Debt with Debt Management. Debt is not inherently bad, but it must be used to further entrench the Moat of a business or increase earnings power proportionally more than the cost of servicing the debt. A great and often used bad example of this is AT&T. They have incurred piles of debt with little to no benefit to the earnings power of the company and in their case their debt actually weakened their Moat as it indirectly is responsible for the rise of TMobile as a legitimate competitor.

3) This is the toughest to judge IMO but in general you should prefer that management is paid in salary and not stock options, but simultaneously owns significant equity in the company. This guarantees that management is not incentivized to pump the share price or manipulate numbers to increase the options they receive while also giving them skin in the game so their primary focus is the long term health of the company.

Currently I’m only having some of the stocks from company I work for as part of employee share buying scheme (get it at 20% discount, signing up for either 3 or 5 years contract). This year it expires , and I’ll probably take out the money (partially because want to buy a house in next couple years) and also planning on putting £5k into investing from that. Any suggestions on what might be good place to research where to put this money in ? Definitely will want to diversify.",Scorpio93x,1,/r/investing/comments/ngv55o/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gyt279r/,0.0,0.89,0.11,0.9211

71,UONEK," Hello,

I'm fairly new to investing and woke up today to find that im ~70% up on a stock that I'd kind of forgotten about. 

I want to know if it's a ""safe"" or good strategy to sell to cover the initial cost and just sit on of the rest for longer? Or should I hold out and hope it gets higher? 

I'm 25, and I don't really need the money right now. Mostly I just like playing with stocks to see what I can make here or there, but this is definitely a much larger return than I expected from this stock.

For specifics, the stock is UONEK, which I bought 200 units of for $566 (USD). I think I'd need to sell about 120 of my 200 to cover my cost.",lepancake,1,/r/investing/comments/ngv55o/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gyur2lk/,0.012,0.894,0.094,0.8183

I would like to buy a house in the next few years. Never have so know I can probably get help through first time buyers programs.  Outside of that I want to save for retirement.

If a house, then 3 years.  If retirement, then 25 years or so.

73,USA," Looking for some input on my new portfolio, I'd really appreciate any insight.

I'm 56, in the USA. Not employed at the moment. I have 800k that I'm going to invest, 1.2m in savings, and my house is paid off. My time horizon is probably 10-15 years, I'm not planning on touching any of these investments for at least that long, or potentially longer. I'm fine with an average return (at least 6-7% annual or more) if it means less risk.

Here's what I'm considering:

50% VTI $400,000

20% VXUS $160,000 

10% BND $80,000 

5% VCR $40,000

5% MGV $40,000

5% QQQ $40,000 

5% CDC $40,000

Retirement savings. Maybe buy a house but don't really know where I'm going to end up. A house in Ohio is quite a different goal than a house in SF bay area.

Also I would change the tilt over time as valuations change.",embrace-ur-elements,1,/r/investing/comments/ngv55o/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gyvcqg3/,0.033,0.917,0.051,0.3612
86,ETH," I assumed he was still talking about this IRA.  In which case that's like asking ""what should I get on my hotdog?"" and you saying ""i'lL sTiCk To HaMbUgErs!""

I agree it's a bit, eh, *weird* to have a defi assets in a tradfi account, but the tax savings is not insignificant (and if you already have money in your IRA, then, easy choice...). Fund fee is a bit high as well, admittedly a big drawback, but even just a 20% gain offsets the fees (which is *nothing* in crypto), and defi fees are a thing in themselves.

That said, if it's just money outside of retirement accounts, absolutely open CBPro or Gemini Active account and buy some ETH directly. Somedays indeed I have the notion to just liquidate my IRA contributions and put directly into the tokens for more control. The difference between tradfi and defi is like the difference between writing a letter and mailing it vs texting somebody.

87,IT," I don’t think you’re missing anything, but there are a few things you want to consider. Here is what I can think of:

Over the past 10+ years, interest rates have been at all-time low. This disproportionately helps tech growth and high-debt companies (note the overlap there). As interest rates (almost inevitably) rise, these stocks are not expected to perform as well. 

Like you said, tech/IT is more volatile. In a market decline, especially a sustained one, tech companies will struggle more than the broad economy. 

These are really the only two things that “refute” your thinking that I could think of. I think your thinking is very much on the right track. With that being said, I’m on your said. I too am young and have a long time horizon, so I am (partly) in etfs with significant expense ratios and with significant volatility. Just make sure you understand the risks. 

Final thing: We are young. Now is the time to take risks. I personally would never treat the stock market like a casino, but I am willing to make big, long term bets. Fortune favors the bold.

88,MSCI," As others have mentioned, actively managed funds tend to underperform passive. 

Part of your problem here is that the S&P is not a valid comparison to your fund. The closest index equivalent is the MSCI US Software and Services 20/50 index:

If you compare your mutual fund to this, you will see there is basically no difference. 

Also be careful as to what you are comparing. Sometimes funds will show growth excluding management fees, which makes a huge difference. 

For specific context, an MER of 0.5% vs 0% will cost you 9% of earnings directly from the MER and 4% further in opportunity cost - and active fund with a 0.5% MER would need to outperform a passive index fund by 13% **every year** in order to beat a passive fund.

And that’s just an MER of 0.5%. By the time you’re at 1.5%, it needs to outperform by 34% to break even.",aedes,1,/r/investing/comments/ngnide/mutual_funds_does_expense_ratio_matter/gytrkh1/,0.03,0.848,0.122,0.8957
89,IT," Those are two very different mutual funds. You need to pick what kinds of mutual funds you want to invest in before making an apples and oranges comparisons. An S&P 500 Index fund is naturally going to have a low expense ratio, as there is little to no work involved in picking what stocks will be in the fund. It is the 500 largest companies on the NYSE, simple as that. The other fund you listed is a fund whose stocks have been specifically curated by the funds management. It targets stocks within a specific sector and then through qualitative, quantitative, and technical analysis the fund’s managers choose what stocks to include in the fund. There is way more work involved in this, which is one of the reasons the expense ratio is significantly higher. 

Decide first what kind of funds you want to buy. Then compare expense ratios between funds of the same type. You are correct that of the two funds you listed, the Software and IT fund would beat the Index fund regardless of its expense ratio. But this is an apples and oranges comparison. If you instead compare the the Fidelity 500 Index Fund to something like the Fidelity ZERO large cap index fund (both are S&P 500 Index funds) Fidelity ZERO wins all day because it has a 0% expense ratio. 

TLDR: Don’t put all of your eggs into the Software and IT fund just because it looks better at a glance. It may be beating the market, but it also comes with a much higher risk factor. Decide what types of funds you want to buy first based on your desired level of risk. Then compare the returns and expense ratios within funds of each type.

92,IT," It's worth pointing out that the expense ratios reflect porcesses that lower expected returns. It reflects the labor and technology costs that go into picking some stocks and excluding others. But stock picking, in the long run, is a losing game because growth tends to come disproportionately from a small portion of companies. That is, the cheap haystack is a better buy than the expensive attempt to dig through it, in part because, on average, those attempts fail. 

Using your example, the S&P 500 comparison is unfair: the difference in performance has to do mostly with sector/industry exposure, not active management. Compare it instead to VITAX, vanguard's IT index. It holds 331 companies (haystack), compared to FSCSX's 71. Keeping with what we would expect, the passive (ER .1%) index has outperformed the active one by 6% 1 year, 3% 3 year, and 3% 5 year. Fidelity did manage to beat it early and pull ahead by 0.8 percent over 10 years, but that difference is a) more likely due to luck than skill because manager skill is largely mythical and b) almost entirely erased by the difference in expenses.",prich889,1,/r/investing/comments/ngnide/mutual_funds_does_expense_ratio_matter/gyvevdz/,0.095,0.833,0.072,-0.6979
