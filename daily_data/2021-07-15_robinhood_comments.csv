Hmmm... I don't know about this.

I don't work for Robinhood and receive directed death threats about twice a month now. I don't believe op works for Robinhood either and unless I lock their posts, I'm forced to filter out comments that claim they'll be harmed same way and/or sued. It happens so regularly that I spent time writing bots to automatically handle a lot of what's posted here on /r/Robinhood and sent to me via PM or modmail. ...and even that's not enough. Almost without fail, it's people who worked themselves up in the same two subs then come here to try and draw anyone who dares to use Robinhood into a fight. Even people just asking how... IPOs work or looking for info about a particular stock will get replies telling them they deserved to lose their money or worse just for daring to use Robinhood (or Webull or TDA or any other service besides... well, yeah, these guys seem to only like Fidelity). If you've ever seen me just reply to a removed comment with a clown emoji, that's me mockingly acknowledging how fucking clownish the worst of the worst are.
