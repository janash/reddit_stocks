10,SE," The market indices in the US are bad this week. They'll probably stay bad for a minute, too. Today, it was driven by a worse-than-expected jobs report. Next week, expect to see climbing gas prices (think of the refineries in SE Texas). If the economic impact (""stimulus"") bill is slowed down or halted next week, we seriously risk coming up against the mid-March moratorium on evictions and foreclosures before money and/or policy changes happen, which will be a big mess for a lot of people. Treasury Secretary Yellen is back-and-forth on inflation, but has prioritized a stimulating monetary policy over one that slows inflation and has proposed some measures that may tax unrealized gains from securities. Those actions could both potentially be good for long-term recovery, but will definitely be worrisome in the short-term.   


More businesses are opening offices in-person and more schools are moving towards in-person classes. On the surface, that sounds like good news, but there are still real concerns about how well the pandemic is being quelled before vaccinations have rolled out and numbers overall are still much higher than the initial recommendations when the lockdowns started last year. A surge in COVID cases could definitely lead to morale issues and/or fears of lockdown restrictions that will slow down commerce (and therefore the markets). Inversely, a too-careful approach to reopening basically guarantees depressed commerce (and therefore a depressed market).   


On top of all that, the market plunge last March wasn't enough to slow down a raging bull market that in no way represents the values or health of the corporations involved. There's some movement away from fundamentals right now (the value of the company isn't what its balance sheet says it's worth, but what people think it should be worth). That's not necessarily a bad thing and could actually help us avoid an ongoing downturn, but alternatively it could signal a bubble that will need to pop to get back on track.   


Later in the year, the indices will likely start charging again. There's less volatility in American politics than there has been in a long time and as more people get vaccinated and the COVID news levels out and improves, commerce will look great (I know I'm planning on splurging on a big vacation and going out to eat and shopping and mall-walking like a 90 year-old and watching crappy movies in dingy theaters and going to hear my favorite symphonies and visiting museums full of art I don't understand and watching acrobats do things that I can't and rolling dice at a craps table and giving more time to volunteer to help people who can't yet afford to do things and drink something I don't even particularly like in a dive bar and \[...honestly, name anything that I used to be able to do...\] once this is over *just because I can*. I suspect that many millions of others will do the same).   


tl;dr: things are in the red this week. Depending on upcoming news in the next couple of weeks, they could be in the red for a few weeks or even a few months. Don't panic. The downturn will probably be short and not too intense. This is an opportunity to buy the sale.",Cmgeodude,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/lmozr6/anyone_else_having_nothing_but_red_this_week_or/gnwnvx9/,0.083,0.785,0.132,0.9862

120,CEO," I believe there are just so many upsides associated with it. (1) Their fundamentals point to an undervaluation relative to their peer group, and their messy history gives an explanation for it. (2) Their CEO does have a proven track record, in an industry that shares a lot of traits with retail marijuana. (3) There will likely be ongoing good news - pandemic easing is good for pot sales in Canada, and it seems likely there is some move or other afoot using their refilled cash reserves.

My belief is that this share will shake off the majority of its pump&dump adherents when it creeps its way up toward $0.40 and then contracts. Institutional investors will capture the shares because of the fundamentals being sound and because of their comparative information advantage widening each day past earnings. The long ride pump & dumpers will probably exit at $1.00, and this stock will just keep on going up after that contraction unless there are any major missteps, eventually trading in the multiple dollars range.

125,OGI," It is not a short term play, and the large volume of pump-and-dumpers comingling with institutional shorting is probably holding back the share price. I view this the way I view OGI when it hangs down around $1 -- valued off of its natural level. I think OGI belongs around $2.5. I think this stock belongs at about $0.7 just right now, and has so many growth options beyond that. It will slowly rise out of being a speculative stock and into being a consistent outperformer within its peer group. 

Or it'll trade sideways for a year and then drop 30% when people decide they're not going to get their warrant shares, in which case I'll be buying that dip too if the company remains undervalued.

126,BMO," It's not short term, just be comfortable with a long position. I view this as a possible 10:1 payout on something that's 3:2 odds. It's just a lot of upside and not much downside, though you should always put your money to work where you think it'll work best. I am in this for 25k shares, but it still comprises only a piece of my overall portfolio and is in the top 3 risky positions I hold.

Possible upcoming catalysts include:

1) Mid-March: Does BMO execute their 30-day over-allotment?

2) Next 3 Months: Any public news on the use of that cash? If it's for an acquisition, we could be hearing about a deal very soon.

3) April: ""Pandemic lite"" spring data from the Canadian MJ marketplace will start to become available, helping align forecasts.

4) Next earnings call, May 15th -- is the Beena turnaround real?

I am longterm very bullish. I also think investors underestimate the degree to which the Canadian marijuana marketplace has itself been mismanaged. Stores have not been readily available, prices have not been remotely competitive, staff have not been trained, product lines have not been differentiated, in-store marketing effectively does not exist, etc etc.",gnomilio,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/lm6f8w/due_diligence_on_sprwffireto/gnw2v4k/,0.034,0.882,0.085,0.8531
127,CEO," I think the share dilution will not continue. The most recent bought deal occurred after a significant uptick in acquisition by ETFs. The board would have known that dilution would not be viewed especially favorably, and I believe they made the decision knowing the cash would be used for something that would make their new owners willing to accept the dilution.

The CEO here did not enter the climb to the apex of her career looking to run a pump-and-dump. The focus has been on fundamentals and retail marketing, two areas where her competition struggles and that her career has equipped her to be competitive.

Basically I believe there will not be any further dilution of shares and that there may eventually be a reverse split. Because of the low market cap and growth prospects, though, I think the stock can hit $1 on its own merits, valuing the company at ~650M, or in the same league as Organigram.

Before I start, this isn't without risk and is one of the riskier ones I've put money on. But I'm gonna explain why I'm long and willing to let it play out.

Randell Torno was actually a significant person in the US military (Lt. Col, bronze star from Iraq) specifically in logistics and transporting a $10 billion in equipment around the world. [He then went on to serve in Ethiopia in an actual socially impactful and meaningful way.](https://www.army.mil/article/33579/mentorship_in_ethiopia_offers_low_cost_high_impact_benefits)

The ""other guy"" in this story (Ed Bollen) is a former CIA agent who has put millions into buying multiple companies. 


Each of them tried to achieve specific goals by starting at a specific point only to find out they needed someone else or something else to actually get to what they wanted (this happens all the time in entrepreneurial business). This ended up in them acquiring and buying and becoming majority shareholders in multiple businesses over the last 5+Years. 

The culmination being $ALYI where they have an answer and actual practical solution to using every part of industrial hemp (there's very few businesses using or buying it currently), they have extraction tech and a patent to help treat COPD with cannabis (I actually used to have KALY shares long ago but sold years back, it could really be huge), they have a CPG (consumer packaged goods) company selling sports water and are exploring many other things and have a website to start selling it. 

They also just started putting more of their money where their mouth is and [moved almost all of  the companies to near where the $ALYI project is starting,](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pura-partnership-paog-alkm-prepare-150100757.html) which to me shows actual corporate action *(albeit finally, after a long time of over promising)* towards a unified goal rather than aimlessly announcing things. 

It's like they got their ducks in a row. Accepted they had to dilute like mad to survive years of trying to solve the big picture, and are unifying on an idea that if they pull off they will be ungodly wealthy. 

They've absolutely been shit for investors, Ed being the majority shareholder in most companies is a benefit now that action is happening, but they both actually suck really bad at messaging and basically treat it like it should look like a gmail group email with too many people and too many previous PRs included. Which absolutely scares off people.

These guys are military guys with huge logistical brains trying to solve big problems without much help to start, the ball they dropped was messaging and don't quite understand what the investor wants (notice them still directing traffic to websites that probably looked smart when they learned about websites long ago, but I don't expect 2 military guys to have programming skills to build half a dozen sleek websites and create art for it.)

They have holes, they absolutely need some work and polishing. 

But they've also now committed to actual dates on multiple companies and made big announcements all around the same time to relocate and execute their plan after the shift in political landscape. 

I have hope that two distinguished military guys, one with a passion for filmmaking aren't risking it all to scam some retail guys out of money when they actually have the brains and capacity to solve the problem and achieve something big. 

It's with big risk, so my positions aren't all huge. But I plan on continuing to average in over time if they meet deadlines. 

A few years from now Farmersville, Texas and Dallas could be a huge hub for hemp and EV industry. Which would massively benefit Tesla also moving 2 hours from there as well. 

There's real meat to the bone, there's plenty of reasons to doubt and it's a VERY long DD to sift through the spammy style PRs they do. But I actually am hopeful for the guys.

I could be wrong and will be willing to say so in the end, but it's a long term thing that I truly want to see if it can succeed. The implications of having everything they need and partnerships to do something so big as $ALYI's goals of leapfrogging gas in rural developing nations and go straight to EV built off Hemp tech (that they've partnered with $IQST, that booming ticker) that could grow in these developing countries and they could be part of the industry is beyond huge.

The culmination being $ALYI where they have an answer and actual practical solution to using every part of industrial hemp (there's very few businesses using or buying it currently), they have extraction tech and a patent to help treat COPD with cannabis (I actually used to have KALY shares long ago but sold years back, it could really be huge), they have a CPG (consumer packaged goods) company selling sports water and are exploring many other things and have a website to start selling it. 

They also just started putting more of their money where their mouth is and [moved almost all of  the companies to near where the $ALYI project is starting,](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pura-partnership-paog-alkm-prepare-150100757.html) which to me shows actual corporate action *(albeit finally, after a long time of over promising)* towards a unified goal rather than aimlessly announcing things. 

It's like they got their ducks in a row. Accepted they had to dilute like mad to survive years of trying to solve the big picture, and are unifying on an idea that if they pull off they will be ungodly wealthy. 

They've absolutely been shit for investors, Ed being the majority shareholder in most companies is a benefit now that action is happening, but they both actually suck really bad at messaging and basically treat it like it should look like a gmail group email with too many people and too many previous PRs included. Which absolutely scares off people.

These guys are military guys with huge logistical brains trying to solve big problems without much help to start, the ball they dropped was messaging and don't quite understand what the investor wants (notice them still directing traffic to websites that probably looked smart when they learned about websites long ago, but I don't expect 2 military guys to have programming skills to build half a dozen sleek websites and create art for it.)

They have holes, they absolutely need some work and polishing. 

But they've also now committed to actual dates on multiple companies and made big announcements all around the same time to relocate and execute their plan after the shift in political landscape. 

I have hope that two distinguished military guys, one with a passion for filmmaking aren't risking it all to scam some retail guys out of money when they actually have the brains and capacity to solve the problem and achieve something big. 

It's with big risk, so my positions aren't all huge. But I plan on continuing to average in over time if they meet deadlines. 

A few years from now Farmersville, Texas and Dallas could be a huge hub for hemp and EV industry. Which would massively benefit Tesla also moving 2 hours from there as well. 

There's real meat to the bone, there's plenty of reasons to doubt and it's a VERY long DD to sift through the spammy style PRs they do. But I actually am hopeful for the guys.

I could be wrong and will be willing to say so in the end, but it's a long term thing that I truly want to see if it can succeed. The implications of having everything they need and partnerships to do something so big as $ALYI's goals of leapfrogging gas in rural developing nations and go straight to EV built off Hemp tech (that they've partnered with $IQST, that booming ticker) that could grow in these developing countries and they could be part of the industry is beyond huge.

150,VERY," I think there's two possible stories here. I spent 3 days reading everything on these guys, their bios, their company's partnerships, what connections they have in the world and potential connections they have in their new location and I'm gonna spell out my opinion. 

Before I start, this isn't without risk and is one of the riskier ones I've put money on. But I'm gonna explain why I'm long and willing to let it play out.

Randell Torno was actually a significant person in the US military (Lt. Col, bronze star from Iraq) specifically in logistics and transporting a $10 billion in equipment around the world. [He then went on to serve in Ethiopia in an actual socially impactful and meaningful way.](https://www.army.mil/article/33579/mentorship_in_ethiopia_offers_low_cost_high_impact_benefits)

The ""other guy"" in this story (Ed Bollen) is a former CIA agent who has put millions into buying multiple companies.

Adding this as a reply in case the link gets filtered.

The biggest hole there is, is there's no real answer to the condom company (which I view as was solving a social issue - risky business venture.)

236,ATNF," ÔªøATNF is a $125M very under-the-radar Biotech. 

Vanguard acquired over 11% stake last week for 2 of its funds. $7B Anti-TNF Drug will get Phase 3 results later in the year (Highly likely approval). Strong Pipeline. The management Team will literally blow you away....they own over 55% of shares which are locked for 12 months & they are talking no salaries. Also, Anti-TNF Platform trials are fully grant-funded through completion % no offerings for at least 3 years.  Stock chart looks like its on its way to forming a Cup pattern (Cup/Handle).

Management:  ATNF management team is as good as any Large Cap: 2 of the co-founders discovered Anti-TNF Biologics & successfully completed trials phases & approval for the 1st approved Drug in the class- Remicade, which JNJ bought for over $5B. (This class is now the top-selling class of Drugs in the world... ie Remicade, Humira, Enbrel- these 3 alone sold $35B in the US in 2020).  Marc Feldmann won a Lasker award (only 2nd to Nobel) for the discovery.  Anti-TNF is 1 of their 3 platforms.  Another Co-Founder discovered the body's endocannabinoid system & will likely be a 2021 Nobel nominee for formulating synthetic CBD analogs (which is the 2nd of ATNF's platforms).  Additionally, the team collectively have sold Drugs or Companies to JNJ, Amgen, Biogen, and Bristol Myers.. each transaction was over $4B. Team also includes Prior President of Roche Bio, Chair of Clinical research prof at Standford & another with the same title at Oxford. (You can find full bios on 180LifeSciences.com). 

Initial drop: (why so undervalued currently) The company formed via the merger of 3 small biotech through a SPAC that went public 3 months ago. Due to a long clucky SPAC process, with horrible marketing (everyone thought this was a ""european pot stock"" bc the company being acquired was listed as CannaRX Bio- b/c that happen to be the 1 used for paperwork name. Combined this with an offering that included Rights & Warrants, and the multiple extensions- the price of Right & Warrant remained very low & on merge day, when Right converted- the Share Price dropped below $3.  This had nothing to do with the fundamental of the company- but rather an awful SPAC process (the SPAC manager is no longer associated with the company and sold most of her shares past several months (prob to avoid a lawsuit). 

Cup Pattern: But now ppl are slowly becoming aware of the company and incredible team & pipeline... and the Price has risen to $6.75. It now appears likely to complete the run up back to $11 to complete a Cup pattern by End of week (due to no resistance over $7 bc of initial drop). And due to the Cup Depth of $9 ... the rebound from the subsequent handle has a Price Target of $20 (next 1-2 months). At $20 the Market Cap would only be around $400M .. which is likely an accurate current valuation. (Approval of the $7B Phase 3 Drug by EOY would take the share price at very least above $80).  So today is the best timing to get in below $7... and likely take advantage of both the run up to $11 then $20. And be able to hold for bigger potential returns longer term.",SCModerate,4,/r/pennystocks/comments/lmhbq7/daily_plays_february_18_2021/gnvhj3h/,0.041,0.898,0.061,0.8751

Not giving any advice here - but I really don't see any difference between the 2 companies in terms of potential. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.

495,CFB," ""Major League Football was founded in December 2014 with the intention of a being a spring football league in an attempt to fill the void left by minor or development football leagues such as the [World Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Football_League), the [United States Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Football_League), the [XFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFL_(2001)) and [United Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Football_League_(2009%E2%80%932012)) (all of which lasted less than five years), and the then current [Fall Experimental Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_Experimental_Football_League) (FXFL).""  - Wikipedia

  
I am a massive fan of football, this league started in 2014 and I have never heard of it. Don't think that's a great sign when the old XFL, CFBL, CFB, etc etc are more on the radar than this.

I'd rather take a gamble on the fan controlled league than invest in an old antiquated B league to NFL that I have never heard of. And honestly I wouldn't invest in the new league with my own money or anyone else I knew.

496,IMO," I have yet to hear a compelling argument for the lasting power of the MLFB. Though a fundamentally different concept than XFL, Arena, etc. in some regards, what intrigue does it offer that the others haven't? I'm not speaking for anyone else, but as a huge NFL and college football fan, I have never been compelled whatsoever to follow any of these extraneous leagues.

The only reason that MiLB (baseball) and G-League (basketball) have survived over the years is because the teams are directly affiliated with the professional teams. There is actual vested interest from the pros, as well as brand (team) loyalty from fans to some extent.

Correlating the success of the NFL with the potential of any attempt at a secondary league is flawed on so many levels. While the NFL would still be around without it, the fantasy football phenomenon cannot be overlooked. Without fantasy football, the NFL would be a shell of the behemoth that it currently is... and nobody is going to play fantasy MLFB.


TL;DR: No direct pro team affiliation, no fantasy football draw, and an exhibition of inferior players...

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
Posted several times yesterday and today.

Good morning,

I‚Äôm a former army surgeon.   Nowadays it‚Äôs emergency, critical care and toxicology.  Surgery and emergency are separate departments and never shall they cross here where I work.

The stock looks only accessible from the Paris & Berlin exchanges.  No exposure to the broader market.

Their products look great!  But are designed for spinal repair, stabilization, straightening, etc...  it‚Äôs a distinctly niche market, where they have a high end product.  They are trying to turn around, because they are good products... but will always have limited volume, and will compete against the larger supply companies...  it‚Äôs easier to sell VWs than it is to sell Maseratis, even though we know which we would prefer.

I wish them luck, I wish I had some of their products in years gone by.  But also in the west (and they have a USA supply web page too) it is a niche market, supply companies, insurance & price agreements, etc...

But hey, you do you unless you get too sick or injured, in which case I do you.  Cheers and cheerios!",duTemplar,9,/r/pennystocks/comments/lmiz2c/spineway/gnve5xx/,0.082,0.776,0.142,0.9251

REDWOOD CITY, CA / ACCESSWIRE / February 11, 2021 /Biotricity, Inc. (OTCQB:BTCY) (""Biotricity"" or the ""Company""), a medical diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company, is pleased to provide unaudited, preliminary financial results for its fiscal 2021 third quarter, which ended December 31, 2020. Full financial results will be posted on EDGAR on February 16, 2021. Biotricity's Q3 results continued a trend of both sequential and year over year revenue growth, with revenue setting a new quarterly record in the fiscal third quarter.

For fiscal Q3 2021, management is reporting the following highlights:

Revenue of $1 million (USD) - a milestone for Company in its quarterly results

Year-over-year quarterly revenue increased 162%

Sequential quarter-over-quarter revenue increase 34.5%

""We achieved significant growth during a period of restricted travel due to Covid, so we are even more optimistic about our growth potential as the business environment unlocks,"" stated Waqaas Al-Siddiq, CEO of Biotricity. ""Our sequential quarterly growth really illustrates the importance of our technology and model, where we are enabling a cardiologist while improving patient care. Monthly sequential growth is a sure sign that our platform is on target, and we are on track to continue our strong sequential and year over year growth.""

""During the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company experienced a gross margin of 49.2% compared to 43.6% in the preceding quarter,"" said Biotricity's CFO, John Ayanoglou. ""This improvement is consistent with our prior forecast that the cost of devices sold and other technology associated fees will become a lower percentage of revenues as sales volumes expand. We had significant product development activity during the quarter, including an FDA filing, so our net loss of $0.11 per share was higher than the net loss of $0.085 cents per share in Q2.""

In the current quarter (fiscal Q4 2021) and for the remainder of calendar 2021, the Company is guiding to continued triple-digit revenue growth on a year over year basis. With added resources from a convertible debt financing completed in January 2021, Biotricity is currently interviewing additional sales personnel as part of a planned geographic expansion into additional states. The Company filed a 510(K) seeking FDA approval for its new Biotres Holter product on December 31, 2020 and expects the review process to run approximately four months.

Dr. Waqaas Al-Siddiq added, ""We are coming out of the gate at a full sprint in 2021, with salesforce expansion and work underway on new products that will enable us to target a much larger segment of the cardiologist patient population. We spent years developing best-in-class technology coupled with a compelling technology as a service model.

559,DD," Thank you, glad you found value in the DD. Yeah, weird name, it's actually Asia Metals, Inc, owned as a subsidiary of Asia Broadband. I should have mentioned that, thank you for calling my attention to it. Maybe I can fix my post. (edit: fixed my post)

Yes, gold fluctuates, but it does hold tangible value which many appreciate.

I watched and questioned the massive rise too, when I was considering taking a position. Watching it, I suspected a p&d also, so I just shook my head and didn't buy in.

Then I started more research‚ÄîI did take a position after that. After looking at the short report [article](https://news.squeezereport.com/short-squeeze/asia-broadband-inc-otcmkts-aabb-short-squeeze-2021-02-16/) on SqueezeReport, it looks like that rise may have been due to shorts covering, either in part or in whole.

560,IMO," The idea sounds solid to me, the first downside that pops to mind though is I'm not sure they're targeting the right market for it to catch on. The entire idea behind the creation of cryptos was that it's not physically anything, it's entirely digital currency and thus is worth whatever the market says it's worth, outside of real world influences. Having a ""crypto"" that's is directly linked to the price of gold defeats that entire purpose if gold value ever drops. 

IMO this sounds more like an unredeemable gold voucher than a crypto and they might have better luck catching on if they target the precious metals buyers rather than the crypto buyers.",Oni_Imports,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/lmmb5e/aabb_research_brief_before_next_weeks_product/gnw1t1c/,0.049,0.778,0.173,0.9329

568,ACA," Also, EVO100, which is the same ingredients as Phexxi, is in clinical trials for the reduction of transmission of chlamydia and gonorrhea. Initial results show ~50% reduction in chlamydia and ~78% of gonorrhea. 

Beyond nonoxyl-9 being less effective, it is also known to increase the odds of transmissions of STIs across the board as well as some cancers. Also, spermicide does not have lubricating properties as I understand it but someone please correct me if I'm wrong and there are versions out there that do.

Phexxi immobilizes sperm instead if killing them; this is important because along with everything else they're applying for a seperate 19th category of birth control for the ACA. If you don't know, any one BC from a single BC category is covered by ACA so you can get a BC across multiple categories covered. This would be the motherlode of catalysts if it becomes reality but I'm putting it at less than 50-50 odds since the mechanism is splitting hairs on an injectable gel, regardless of how ridiculously better Phexxi is compared to spermicides.

The price of the product is ridiculously high atm so insurance is the only way to go for most people. Ideally it would drop in price and become OTC once EVFM recoups their costs over the years of trials.

What really needs to be clarified is the reduction of BV/YI/other compared to some sort of control. In the trials <2% of participants had issues or discontinued use because of irritation from BV, YI, ect. From a CDC/NIH paper approximately 1/3rd of adult women suffer from BV every year. 33% -> 2% reduction (or even half) would be insane. My guess is that there were too many complicated factors and no obvious way to set up a ""control"" for just sex (since women contract bacterial and other minor infections from vectors other than sex).

587,GOOG," NLST owns all MetaRams DD3s... Hynix needs them to run the 16 bit memory modules. I'm surprised when NLST sued MetaRam they didn't go for financial reprocusions. The only way that would not happen is that somehow MetaRam was given these memory cells from someone else or the sale was so low it wouldn't matter... MetaRAM now has no ownership in DDR3 memory. Intel should be now endorsing Netlist as a solution to go with Intel‚Äôs upcoming microprocessors, code-named Nehalem. MetaRAM announced its first-generation chips based on DDR2 memory. That solution proved popular in servers from companies such as RackSpace. But it was used in a much smaller slice of the market for servers that use processors from Advanced Micro Devices. The new DDR3 is best on the market it seems. Memory chip maker Hynix is showing memory modules today with working MetaRAM DDR3 chip sets including the world‚Äôs biggest 16-gigabyte memory module for Intel servers, and is getting sued by Netlist for the continual usage of the memory cells without compensation.
Now the entire server market is open to Netlist.

Hynix, Alphabet (GOOG), MegaRam... with MegaRam totally giving up all rights to their memory cells to Netlist... the entire market belongs to Netlist. And GOOG need them for memory of Chrome that takes up alot of memory and power and it seems the only solution may lay only in the top of the line memory cell, MegaRam DD3.

HYNIX HAD A surprise at IDF, DDR3 Metaram (Which now fully belongs to Netlist). This bodes well for being able to stuff a monumentally stupid amount of RAM into a Nehalem box.

Aside from being a bit earlier than most people were expecting, there is little groundbreaking news here, the lawsuit by Netlist was expected. T

Wouldn't it be then for this version that uses 1GBit DDR3 chips, to make an 8GB two-rank DIMM, that Hynix claims is theres all belongs to Netlist?

These kinds of servers are now able to run more efficiently, saving electricity costs in big data centers and allowing servers to handle complex files such as medical images without choking on the huge amount of data.

Hynix already sold a huge sums of these DDR3's it received from MetaRam... everything they sold belongs to Netlist and these DDR3's are already being used in many high tech industries... so MetaRam already said guilty and they had to get out of the business of DDR3 memory modules... Then Netlist can now go after any company with the MetaRam DDR3 and charge them a service fee, lost costs, and make them pay for the usage in which the companies would have to sue Metaram to get any cost back which may put MetaRam out of business... Netlist sells to Samsung already, Google might have biten off more then they can chew, and Netlist is awaiting their share of '912 patent can be found in various DDR3 and DDR4 server DIMMs (Dual Inline Memory Module) as well as future products that will be produced under the DDR5 server DIMM standards currently being established by the industry.

Which seems to mean that for GOOG to stay top of the line in memory cells they will have to go with the DDR5... which is a standard for the whole Intel industry.... And Netlist owns it all. 

Want memory? Netlist owns you. Unbelievable if that is correct. This is probably what Crypto is going to need for ongoing and continuous records that will always need to be tracked in real time and logged. The memory for such a endeavor is already seems to be here... it's called the DDR5... and Netlist owns it all. And its not called MetaRam any more.... Its Netlist DDR5.

Memory belongs to Netlist and is merely used by big intel... Onward with the DDR5... the DDR3 is prehistoric. This should bring in more value then Samsung, Micron, MetaRam, and Intel combined.

600,CTXR," I am relatively new to warrants and I was trying to read up on them as much as I could, but I bought a few here to try and figure it out a little bit.  Would you be so kind as to answer some questions?

Why don't the brokers indicate the expiration date or the strike price?

My understanding was that the above info is found in the S-1 SEC filing?  I looked there for CTXR and the latest one I found was fro June of 2020.  This listed 2 different warrants.  Both expiring in 2025, (May and November), and a strike price of $1.00 and $1.13.  How do I know which one I bought?  At the same time, the fact that the S-1 filing was 6 months old kind of threw me off a little.  Should there be a newer one?

I've seen through various articles and strange looking websites while searching for this info that these warrants had a strike price of anywhere between 1.50 to 4.25.  I decided to err on the side of believing more of what the S-1 filing said, and put a little bit of my recent profits into the warrants and try to ride it out a bit and see what they do.
