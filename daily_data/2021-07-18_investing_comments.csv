0,VERY," The other VERY important thing is that mortgages are callable under only very specific circumstances.   Even if you stop paying a mortgage, the foreclosure process is slow.   Margin loans are callable, and failure to meet a call for the addition of more funds will result in a forced sale of your stocks in just a few days.

Normally, it doesn't matter if your house value goes down and you are underwater on your loan.  As long as you keep paying the mortgage you keep the house.

Margin loans are callable and once you hit the SEC 25% maintenance limit, the broker must call it.  Many brokers have higher maintenance limits, such as 30%.   The initial margin limit is 50%.  Brokers can also decide that certain stocks are risky and have higher maintenance requirements, or even decide to no longer count them when calculating your margin equity.",Anonymoose2021,10,/r/investing/comments/omlmey/leverage_in_the_stock_market/h5mbttn/,0.098,0.855,0.047,-0.6954

Nvidia optimizing performance by using the results of prior computations that made little or no difference to figure out where to spend future computation time is, indeed, AI.   Natural language processing and social sentiment like this ETF uses is also a form of AI. The problem is that people assume it's good at its job.  While software can be flawed, AI is assumed to be magical. I blame movies.",ForGreatDoge,1,/r/investing/comments/omypgm/letting_ai_decide_your_investments/h5ognkj/,0.068,0.831,0.1,0.6749
41,AI, To be fair I don't trust this AI either - but instead of aggressive it might also be conservative to protect against drawdown or something else that trades off raw % returns,Shmoogy,2,/r/investing/comments/omypgm/letting_ai_decide_your_investments/h5ofxem/,0.111,0.74,0.149,0.318
42,DD," My problem with the farmland sites is that you don't yet have a way to index the parcels together and microinvest with a set, periodic dollar amount over time, as you would with an index fund. They want these huge chunks of capital, usually in a five figure amount, to be invested in a *single* farm. The problem is that, as a smaller investor, you can't get diversification that way. Not the way you can with something like fundrise, where you invest in multiple different REITs, all composed of many different projects, in whatever dollar amount you want over $100, which is a very manageable quantity. Additionally, the availability of investments is pathetic. At any given time, there will maybe be one or two available, which almost immediately get snapped up, way faster than one could do any sort of significant DD. It can then take weeks to months for another offering to come up. We don't yet have a ""fundrise for farmland,"" unfortunately, and that's really the issue. You can't easily obtain diversification, the amounts needed for investment are staggeringly high, and availability is sparse, so it's just not a great option for the average investor.

I really hope there's more development into this space in the future, because I think farmland is an insanely attractive alternative investment. We've got to get someone to really bring it down to the level of the people and start packaging these farms together for purchase in small quantities by the layman. Until, then, I'm not particularly interested. At least not until those five figure quantities become a much smaller portion of my NW.",itsworththewhile,1,/r/investing/comments/omhrwa/experience_with_farmtogether_or_acretrader/h5llz78/,0.069,0.878,0.054,-0.7434
43,COO," Congrats OP you may have identified an actual scam.  At least multiple misleading marketing comments that I am sure the SEC would love to dole out a few fines over.

Edit:

Holy shit look at their dumbass website, they legit list their years of experience on their website - their CEO is 10 years in the industry and their COO is 5 years lol.  Their investment associates have 5 or less years of experience, one of them spent 3 years at an RIA probably just getting their licenses.  The most tenured employee they have is thier Software engineer.

44,GME, Dude the bots on here are crazy.  It’s like trying how to hold an honest conversation around sensors.  It’s part of what I used to like about the hall wheat nets (wsb) but it seams like after the GME squeeze everything here is super censored so that people who have no idea how something works but feel obligated to regulate it because they won a popularity contest and are competing again in a few years and need to win again to keep their job won’t shut us down,FarmerAndy88,1,/r/investing/comments/omyvyh/stock_market_is_sophisticated_gambling/h5of6wx/,0.059,0.679,0.263,0.9757

In the case of gamma it's forced behavior. You want to say these Greeks don't work yet look at GME and AMC etc. All of them were classic text book short squeezes and gamma squeezes.

48,MSFT," So right now RSI says SPY is rather ""strong"", nearing center line. It can go either way.

But Gamma suggests it'd go toward $426. It won't just break the floor at $426, not unless new information suggests it should. It has a nice pocket of positive Gamma there to pin to.

And that's the idea.

On the off-chance it opens higher sure it could pin to $435, same reason. But most the open interest is piled around $426.

RSI just doesn't tell much by itself. It could stay over bought like MSFT, or it could approach oversold some more...based on RSI, who knows. RSI tends to get volatile in consolidation also.",DarthTrader357,1,/r/investing/comments/omlsir/spy_sell_off_or_sideways_thoughts/h5njhda/,0.0,0.845,0.155,0.9647
