23,TBLT," I'm confused, do they want to dilute or reverse split? It wouldn't make sense to do both. You're right that they have room for more debt, maybe they want to keep growing without taking on more debt. Institutional ownership is up to a little over 10%, so I'm interested if it would be a public or private offering and if private, which institution would be buying. Their q1 reports says they have cash on hand, but not enough to go much further based on their losses, so they need to drum up money somehow.

I've been interested in TBLT for a while, but haven't done enough research. Wouldn't another 300M shares on the market be almost 10x the outstanding shares they currently have?",Itsboomhomie,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/nfxlwr/toughbuilt_stockholder_voting_for_the_611_meeting/gyp2o91/,0.099,0.776,0.125,0.5445
