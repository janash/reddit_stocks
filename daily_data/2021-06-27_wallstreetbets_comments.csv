0,ON," Let me add this in case it’s not written here, 85% of people who BUY an option, call or put lose money, been that way for 30+ years, but the flip side of course is 85% of people who SELL an option make money (think market makers) so to be successful with options is to SELL calls (covered) or my favorite is to SELL puts (naked).  To be successful doing this 
First, find a stock you want to own so if you get put the shares you’re ok owning it.
Second, look for a chart where the shares are going from lower left to upper right.
Now here’s where you can make 20%-40% on your cash.
Example is a stock trading for $22, the $20 put 30-60 days out is selling for .80 ($80/contract) the requirement is a convoluted formula but I’ve always calculated as 20% of assigned amount.  Thus for my example your option requirement is ~$400 ($2000 x 20% = $400) the premium you receive is $80 thus it’s a 20% RETURN ON CAPITAL.  The actual formula is like 20% of put value ($2000) plus the amount out of the money ($100-$200) minus the premium ($80) 
$400 + $100 - $80 = $420 approx. so u see how just using the 20% as I do is very close.  Too many say I’m getting $80 and “risking” $2000 = 4% net but u see how that’s not correct.  I did this exclusively for 4-5 years in early 2000’s and did extremely well and I still have a separate acct just for this.  Also, if the shares do drop you can accept the shares at $20 and sell calls vs shares or roll puts out farther in time if you expect shares to go back up.",Thestockbroker22,118,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o8wqjy/a_beginner_and_intermediate_guide_to_options/h37qu8i/,0.023,0.822,0.155,0.9916

12,GME," It’s a pretty good guide, but it’ll be irrelevant for most people here.

Sure Citadel is likely to blanket positions, but citadel also has influence over everything including CNBC(look at their bright logo on the tv). It’s been a consistent pattern of all the tickers with professional looking Dd.       

DFV was one of the first to post technical analysis. I believe he is a financial advisor with licenses to practice. If a consistent amount of posts following the first price correction correlate with more technical analysis, it shows that the bots know what people are more likely to listen to(pattern of behavior). They can then use that pattern of behavior to fool the reader. I believe some conglomerate said they had everything and social media under control on TV in February, implying that social media could never influence the markets again.      

RKT was the ultimate pump and dump that only a market maker could do. Fill puts to drive price. Fill otm calls where gamma means nothing. Fill stock and post on social media in order to cause panic buying and essentially causing a short squeeze through volatility, and profiting from volatility on the puts on the way down if they sold it. Overall play would’ve been easily worth x10-20 in a few days of trading.   

AMC was their pump and dump. They filled calls and stock. They owned a significant percentage of amc stock on the way up. I don’t know what their ownership percentage is right now, but if it’s being pumped on CNBC likely more than 1%.         

The only way they can dump or make money is by creating demand. They create demand when there are no sellers and suddenly you have a trifecta of margin calls, volatility and fomoers. You can’t sell when there is no demand or else you lose a lot of money.      

Honestly, I don’t care about hedge funds or market makers if they ran a legitimate business that was 100% legal.

AMC was their pump and dump. They filled calls and stock. They owned a significant percentage of amc stock on the way up. I don’t know what their ownership percentage is right now, but if it’s being pumped on CNBC likely more than 1%.         

The only way they can dump or make money is by creating demand. They create demand when there are no sellers and suddenly you have a trifecta of margin calls, volatility and fomoers. You can’t sell when there is no demand or else you lose a lot of money.      

Honestly, I don’t care about hedge funds or market makers if they ran a legitimate business that was 100% legal.

184,TV," First time here? What was the original meme? What was the first meme you recall? Sure Citadel is likely to blanket positions, but citadel also has influence over everything including CNBC(look at their bright logo on the tv). It’s been a consistent pattern of all the tickers with professional looking Dd.       

DFV was one of the first to post technical analysis. I believe he is a financial advisor with licenses to practice. If a consistent amount of posts following the first price correction correlate with more technical analysis, it shows that the bots know what people are more likely to listen to(pattern of behavior). They can then use that pattern of behavior to fool the reader. I believe some conglomerate said they had everything and social media under control on TV in February, implying that social media could never influence the markets again.      

RKT was the ultimate pump and dump that only a market maker could do. Fill puts to drive price. Fill otm calls where gamma means nothing. Fill stock and post on social media in order to cause panic buying and essentially causing a short squeeze through volatility, and profiting from volatility on the puts on the way down if they sold it.

264,SAFE," Uplisting. As mentioned by others, SAFE banking has good prospects to allow for uplisting because it protects ""financial institutions"" when doing business with federally illegal cannabis. Other legislature that has less of a chance of passing include STATES act, MORE, and Schumer's upcoming broader reform bill. STATES act is the home run for MSO's. 

SAFE also helps the MSO's in terms of fundamentals as it grants them access to banking, instead of having to do cash only transactions. Not to mention that having access to banking will help them finance at lower rates. It's funny because the Fed increasing rates narrative was driving the MSO prices down when in reality, the MSO's aren't affected as much. 

Another catalyst for fundamentals is the removal of 280E, which could also be removed with federal descheduling of cannabis. 280E is a tax bill that basically taxes the MSO's nearly double the normal tax. That's why I always look at EBITDA for the MSO's. If 280E wasn't present, most of these MSO's would be generating positive EPS already. (Big 4 are already EBITDA and cash flow positive).",kingkongy,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o8ybo4/michael_burry_hid_a_stock_ticker_in_4_recent/h38rrhz/,0.029,0.807,0.165,0.9739

303,IRS," Depends who you owe the money to and when you decide to leave. Personally I'd choose somewhere without an extradition treaty for this category of shit, but also that is not terrible, like Morocco. 

Not really man... You don't get arrested for unpaid debt (unless you live in a shit stain state where they arrest and jail people then make them work at McDonald's for $.03/hr for unpaid medical debt). However if you owe the IRS too much money, they can stop you from leaving the country by revoking your passport.",ferngully99,99,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o8qz76/is_td_broken_or_do_i_actually_owe_1000000/h36vde7/,0.187,0.752,0.062,-0.9091
304,USA," Owing money in the USA isn't a big deal. I don't know how it is exactly with the stock market, but the people who were sued for millions in the early 2000s for downloading music on Napster and limewire easily dropped all their debt by declaring bankruptcy. Even if you do owe a million, you don't have to pay a cent back.

311,RH," If you hold to expiry the balances don't always reflect correctly over the weekend. 

The real danger in a spread is holding to expiry and then having the price move through your strike in AH. In that case most brokers **don't** automatically exercise the long leg and you can end up fucked. This is why RH will sell your spread if the strike is anywhere near the price about 2 hours before close. It's not foolproof though. A big AH move can still screw you. 

Tldr: you should **never** let a slread expire unless you really know what you are doing.",kazza789,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o8qz76/is_td_broken_or_do_i_actually_owe_1000000/h37d7x7/,0.136,0.864,0.0,-0.9078

366,GME, I think it's crazy people do these mental gymnastics to find value in a company like WISH when if you ever used it you know its an awful company. Their business model is based entirely on the occasional person's occasional curiosity that I guarantee only about a third of its customers feel satisfied at all with the transaction. Analytics don't change that. Find a company thats over shorted that sells more than a disappointing gimmick. I would not want to be left holding the bag for a company like wish but I promise there are good companies unfairly manipulated by shorts out there available to help squeeze. I'm not going to list any here because it would seem like I was just trying to pump them up but I assure you WISH isn't one.

368,WISH, WISH is the all in one scam package in your pocket. It doesn't create any value other than to ship shit from china to the rest of the world. Stuff is cheaply and badly manufactured just to get quick bucks. As long as any scammer on this planet can sell it's trash without real consequences through this casino like app I will stay miles away from this company.

374,AI," I can't invest/trade actively. I made a lot of mistakes in the beginning due to short-term (1 step thinking). I knew if I was playing the long game, I needed to think about this in a 2 step manner. Although I am technically ""gambling"" on the fate of these companies, I think the next 5-10 years will be splendid. Personally I like these companies, and their growth prospects in the near/long term future.

PLTR - Palantir. They have only just begun. People compare this company to Microsoft, or the ""next Microsoft"". Fuck that. They're playing a different game. I think they might get more notoriety if their software suite, was used by intelligence agencies against nation-states like Russia or China. In the electronic warfare front, I think they will be a key player for cybersecurity companies to utilize in offense, and defense. Lots of potential in every industry where information gathering puts you ahead of a competitor or a nation state.

BNGO/NNOX/CRSP - Bionano Genomics/Nanox/Crisper. I don't think this is a joke. I think their tech, with good merit, is a direct disruptor to existing devices and machinery out there. Until their business is cash flow positive, with actual customer purchases, info on whether or not hospitals would jump at the chance to grab these machines, as well as smaller firms. I'm lumping BNGO in with this because of devices, and genomics in general. I also started a small position in CRSP, genomics is relatively new. We don't know what the next decade holds for genome editing, curing diseases, identifying malformed genes and pathways. This is a bright future for humanity when this becomes normalized. Maybe I'll even throw Gingko Bioworks into my genomics port, idk.

U - Unity. Not a call for some kumbaya moment, but a way to bring players and audiences from any location, into immersive worlds, where we can get lost in the reality of our own choosing. I think video games are underrated. Mostly because software of our predecessors has been shit, and in some rare cases, actual gems of ingenuity have formed over the decades. VR might have been a flop, but its not dead. Immersive experiences are really important for a person (imo). Intimacy and belief in a different relativity is RARELY seen in video games or movies in a viewing experience. I hope to see movie theaters and home media centers really trying to draw audiences in with newer experience in the future. How long that might take, I don't know, I'm not an oracle, but whether its in self-driving automobiles, giving you a person car ride / media experience or you have goggles on at home bumping into shit, U will be right there.

ATOM - Atomera. If I were to pick some companies that were easy 10x-50x baggers over the next decade or two, then I would be mostly fucking wrong. But I believe in ATOM. From the particles of our very existence, to semiconductors which run our technologies, and gears innovation, companies like this are actual disruptors.

HOL - Astra. Fedex of space deliveries, or the USPS? Not sure yet. But with an all-star team, (keeps growing), successful launches, and forseeable goals, this is a winner for me. The CEO alone, is a rockstar. Although that could throw people off (think Elon rockstar and what he tweets/says), Chris Kemp is like if Spoc and Kirk had a baby, and Edward Snowden took care of the education. I think he's geniune article, and his experience alone makes me root for the jockey and horse. Ultimately, this is a very young company, in an even younger industry.

STEM/ITAC/ETWO - STEM/Arbe Robotics/E2Open AI/robotics and supply chain AI software, with big customers to boot. reddit buggy ass got rid of my whole section here, too lazy to rewrite.

WOOF - Petco. I have dogs, and I love animals. omnichannel brick and mortor with various subscriptions, and services ready to go? All for the well being of your animal and others? Vet and grooming services? Clothing? Medicine? Toys? All with a good customer experience? Count me in. (i have a 17 page dd on notion about woof, if anyone is interested, pm me i guess). Resides on a more safer delta.

MP - MP Materials. I like metals? Easy non-china winner for materials. It irked me that this was also a Chamath de-SPAC, but whatever. Judge by the team and merits right? Resides on a more safer delta.

SKIN - Beauty Health Company. A staple, well managed company, that's no going anywhere. Long term this is a great hold. Something I considered was Hims, and possibly mental health stocks like Mindmed. I don't know how those companies really work. But I am sure about SKIN.

I don't have fintech, yet. Still looking.

I knew if I was playing the long game, I needed to think about this in a 2 step manner. Although I am technically ""gambling"" on the fate of these companies, I think the next 5-10 years will be splendid. Personally I like these companies, and their growth prospects in the near/long term future.

PLTR - Palantir. They have only just begun. People compare this company to Microsoft, or the ""next Microsoft"". Fuck that. They're playing a different game. I think they might get more notoriety if their software suite, was used by intelligence agencies against nation-states like Russia or China. In the electronic warfare front, I think they will be a key player for cybersecurity companies to utilize in offense, and defense. Lots of potential in every industry where information gathering puts you ahead of a competitor or a nation state.

BNGO/NNOX/CRSP - Bionano Genomics/Nanox/Crisper. I don't think this is a joke. I think their tech, with good merit, is a direct disruptor to existing devices and machinery out there. Until their business is cash flow positive, with actual customer purchases, info on whether or not hospitals would jump at the chance to grab these machines, as well as smaller firms. I'm lumping BNGO in with this because of devices, and genomics in general. I also started a small position in CRSP, genomics is relatively new. We don't know what the next decade holds for genome editing, curing diseases, identifying malformed genes and pathways. This is a bright future for humanity when this becomes normalized. Maybe I'll even throw Gingko Bioworks into my genomics port, idk.

U - Unity. Not a call for some kumbaya moment, but a way to bring players and audiences from any location, into immersive worlds, where we can get lost in the reality of our own choosing. I think video games are underrated. Mostly because software of our predecessors has been shit, and in some rare cases, actual gems of ingenuity have formed over the decades. VR might have been a flop, but its not dead. Immersive experiences are really important for a person (imo). Intimacy and belief in a different relativity is RARELY seen in video games or movies in a viewing experience. I hope to see movie theaters and home media centers really trying to draw audiences in with newer experience in the future. How long that might take, I don't know, I'm not an oracle, but whether its in self-driving automobiles, giving you a person car ride / media experience or you have goggles on at home bumping into shit, U will be right there.

ATOM - Atomera. If I were to pick some companies that were easy 10x-50x baggers over the next decade or two, then I would be mostly fucking wrong. But I believe in ATOM. From the particles of our very existence, to semiconductors which run our technologies, and gears innovation, companies like this are actual disruptors.

HOL - Astra. Fedex of space deliveries, or the USPS? Not sure yet. But with an all-star team, (keeps growing), successful launches, and forseeable goals, this is a winner for me. The CEO alone, is a rockstar. Although that could throw people off (think Elon rockstar and what he tweets/says), Chris Kemp is like if Spoc and Kirk had a baby, and Edward Snowden took care of the education.

SPCE that makes no money and has a retarded business model is worth 13.5 billion? You think it's going up by 125x in 20 years? Selling what to whom?

You morons.  Amazon is up by a factor of 340x since 20 years ago. They made NO profit for most of that time. But at least they did something that made sense. Sell things that ACTUALLY exist. SPCE makes no sense. They don't have a chance at hypersonics either. No one will fly if it's 10x more dangerous than subsonic flight which is already super cheap and super fast.

Even IF you bought in back then, you would have sold big chunks many times, and would have a fraction of the shares you started with. So that 340x would be more like 34x, at best. 

And that is only IF you got lucky enough to pick the ONE company in a multitude of sectors that would come to dominate a sector like no company has ever dominated a sector.

- EV is the worlds biggest consumer transformation since phones. Huge market that is being forced by 2030-2035. NIO is in the biggest car market in the world, China, and the CCP has invested to save them from bankruptcy in the older days (whether you trust the CCP or not, they have power and can easily push brands or $$ to consumers (NIO has no issue with demand).
-Car design (beautiful especially the new sedan ET7) + Battery swap and battery as a service. Battery swapping is so new (money losing right now, built infrastructure. No other company has innovated this) and they have developed swap stations all across China. Battery as a service lets customers buy a car and lease the battery, so cars are a bit cheaper up front.
-European expansion, mainly Norway. Plans to come to US, but thats long term.

NIO will take over China, no doubt in my mind. After all, theres a reason it was 90+% of my portfolio with the run from $3.33 to $66. I still hold ~500 shares and a bunch of LEAPS I got May 10th after selling shares.

I've been in deep depression for the past two and a half weeks since I didn't take profits on my CLOV yolo on 6/9.

I should of sold at the opening bell but I got caught up in all of the hype and thinking it wasn't a PND, retarded, I know. I watched CLOV drill for about two hours and even tried to ""buy the dip"" before throwing in the towel and taking the profits that were left.

It's been killing me inside, I can't stop reliving that morning and the two days of trading that led up to it. I'm suffering from depression, PTSD and now I have crazy insomnia.

I still played it nearly as wrong as I possibly could have. 

The hard thing to understand and accept is that if given a 3rd, 4th, or even 10th chance, I would still make the same ""mistakes"" -- because they aren't mistakes...they are hardcoded neural pathways. It's like a river being mad at itself for where the water flows.

The only advice I can offer is that it will (slowly) get better over time. 

I've been jolted awake multiple times a night for weeks. I've had panic attacks. Listing all the feelings of shame, guilt, anger, regret, remorse, anxiety, etc would fill pages. 

I've wondered if this is the new normal for me and if everything will ever be the same again. I've wondered if living this kind of existence is even worth it. I've wondered if I'll ever get my confidence back (or if I deserve to). It's insane (literally).

One thing that has helped tremendously is CBD tincture (low or no THC content). I got it out of desperation. It takes effect very quickly and mellows me out enough that I can at least get some sleep. Give yourself time and space to heal....it WILL happen with time.

I have similar experiences w/ GME + BB. I had somewhat moved on from the GME fail, but BB was even worse because I KNEW better based on what happened before...yet I made the exact same mistakes **again** despite being given what can only be described as a ""get out of jail free card"" mixed with a miracle. 

I still played it nearly as wrong as I possibly could have. 

The hard thing to understand and accept is that if given a 3rd, 4th, or even 10th chance, I would still make the same ""mistakes"" -- because they aren't mistakes...they are hardcoded neural pathways. It's like a river being mad at itself for where the water flows.

The only advice I can offer is that it will (slowly) get better over time. 

I've been jolted awake multiple times a night for weeks. I've had panic attacks. Listing all the feelings of shame, guilt, anger, regret, remorse, anxiety, etc would fill pages. 

I've wondered if this is the new normal for me and if everything will ever be the same again. I've wondered if living this kind of existence is even worth it. I've wondered if I'll ever get my confidence back (or if I deserve to). It's insane (literally).

560,GME," Ironically for me, the percentages were my worst enemy too. I missed out on selling GME in March for a 100x gain because it was up 38% that day and for some reason I wanted 40% and ""then"" I'd sell. 

Somehow the +10,000% became less relevant even when everything else inside of me should have been screaming to sell especially given what happened in January. But I had no fear and no perspective in the moment. 40% was my next hit.

Given my compromised brain, there's always some arbitrary ""next"" percentage or raw value to anticipate.

What's helped me personally is to focus on total account value and position size and constantly asking ""would you be OK not having this? How much of this are you OK with losing?"" 

Also merely thinking about setting stop losses usually pushes me towards selling since the idea of ""taking less"" with a stop below the current bid makes me feel like I'm getting cheated and outweighs the ""but what if it goes up more"" syndrome by making me focus on what I actually have.

For me I didn't realize what had happened until it was too late. Before all this I was a very disciplined conservative investor type. Then bit by bit I kept adding more and more positions, spending months working from home during COVID where I would compulsively scroll through them all constantly checking on them like an equity zoo. 

At first I felt like a genius and was making a ton, but then started seeing things bleed to zero without realizing something had changed. Every choice I made was the ""wrong"" one so I kept scrambling to inverse myself and got more and more tilted each time.

Edit: I ask because perspective helps. If you are 20-30, have a 10 year mindset. Would you be happy retiring in 10 years at 30-40? That's the appeal of the ""gamble"", for me anyway. You don't need 10 home runs playing in the big leagues to get there. You're not a juiced up freakish talent, physically or mentally. You can't compete there. We compete at the slow pitch softball level. You need a bunch of singles, some doubles, and occasionally a HR. The home runs are awesome, but even the best players usually don't hit them, even when you select from only the times they got on base.

It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.
