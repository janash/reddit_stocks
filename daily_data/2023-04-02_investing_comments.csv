I am a beginner as it relates to investing. I am trying to find the most cost-efficient way to get data, hopefully in a centralized location, for equity/bond valuations?  
  
I know some sites like: Bloomberg, Compustat & Factset are the bigger names out their (also pricey)  
  
I have been digging through previous post on this channel and see some people mention the following tools:  
  
\- FInra (Bond valuation)  
  
\- Fidelity Factsheets (UK investing)  
  
  
In the past, I typically heavily leverage my trading account, Charles Schwab, for gathering data as much as it is available, but I would imagine there some sites out there that can be more of a ""one stop shop"" for data valuation.

Markets and economies aren't the same thing and if anything, research shows they may actually be negatively correlated (Dimson, Marsh, Stanton).

In fact, many places are predicting the US to under perform ex-US going forward over the next decade or so:

Is not the ex-US coverage that actually matters at all. What does matter is capturing how foreign markets behave, and no amount of KO or AAPL will do that for you. Plenty of foreign brands do lots of business in the US, but an ex-US fund isn't appropriate to get US coverage.

These should all show how flawed that line of thinking is:

13,CD," Thanks for the effort. I've been meaning to add the topic to the wiki.

Your post has a few inaccuracies. And there are a lot more short-term interest rate options available. For example: 

US Government debt:

1. A treasury isn't automatically mean that it's a t-bill. An investor that wants to invest in treasuries for a short term could always invest in marketable treasuries that are maturing during the desired time period.
2. As others have mentioned - treasuries are not considered illiquid. 
3. TIPS may also be appropriate depending on the desired duration. 
4. It may be worth to mention STRIPS but I think those are typically longer duration and someone else who knows more about them will have to comment. 
5. The US treasury also offers floating rate notes (FRNs) which could be appropriate for a short-term investor.
6. There are also agency and gse (government sponsored enterprise) bonds which may be appropriate. GSE bonds are not backed by the full faith and credit of the US government unlike agency bonds but are still considered high quality. 
7. There may be tax advantages in using treasuries. 
8. Bills, notes, frns, strips, tips, and agency/gse debt are marketable securities so that means there is a secondary market for this debt. Savings bonds from the treasury are not marketable. 

Money market funds - see here - [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/faq/#wiki\_what\_is\_a\_money\_market\_fund\_and\_how\_safe\_are\_they.3F](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/faq/#wiki_what_is_a_money_market_fund_and_how_safe_are_they.3F) 

1. Money market mutual funds aren't created by brokers. They are products of investment managers. 
2. The interest rate risk on money market funds is very low. And not sure what you meean by ""market risk"". 
3. Lack of protection by FDIC and SIPC are not necessarily an issue since to qualify as a mmf - there are some very stringent rules. 

CDs:

1.  CDs are products issued by depositories - ie a bank or credit union.
2. Insurance on a CD depends on whether it's issued by a bank or credit union. FDIC insures deposits at a bank. NCUA insures deposits at a credit union.
3. It's always worth to mention callable vs non-callable CDs.

Some other categories:

Munis are another common debt investment which are suitable as a short-term investment. They can be tax efficient depending on the state. 

Another short-term investment option may be investment grade corporate bonds. For investors that don't want to hold individual corporate bonds, the investor can diversify corporate debt using either target date maturity funds or target duration funds.

For more risk - high-yield (ie. junk bonds) bonds or bond funds may be an option for some investors to increase yield by adjusting the average quality of their debt positions. 

For investors that don't want to hold target duration products - they can also create ladders using one or more debt products. 

Another common but more advanced short-term investing strategy is to use long box spreads. This can be used either as an interest rate capture strategy or a financing strategy for lower borrowing costs.  There are also tax benefits of using section 1256 contracts. Box spreads are my preference for less than 4 - 6 month maturity at the moment.",greytoc,1,/r/investing/comments/129svvk/lets_talk_about_shortterm_debt_securities/jepj7kw/,0.078,0.795,0.127,0.9766
