4,GME," Would it *always* be better to sell instead of exercising? No. 

I saw something yesterday that is a good example of this. 

Guy exercised his GME $50 call option yesterday instead of selling. Why do you think that is? If he buys GME yesterday at $50 a share, then to me that says he thinks the price will still go up. So why sell the option and make X amount of money, when you can exercise and hold the shares because you think it’s going to go up more bringing in Y amount of money. 

We typically don’t exercise options because it’s expensive, and the capital has already been used on the options. You are correct in not exercising before expiry because of theta decay, but I wouldn’t go as far as to say that it’s *always* better to sell > exercise. 

This is just my opinion tho not financial advice.",Liteboyy,1,/r/stocks/comments/me6ezj/drinking_and_trading_dont_mix_i_accidentally/gsho6m3/,0.023,0.903,0.075,0.782

If you mean the risk of China invading Taiwan, it's near to zero, so it doesn't matter whether it's priced in.

>  based on what they are doing and the future of what they do 

all of these things are priced in twice as much as they should be. 

TSM is producing at 140% of their capacity, it's not like they can do more in the short term. Increasing capacity requires new investment (which they are doing, building new factories in US), but that's the long-term plan.

Of course, right now they have price power (the best they ever have), but I can't see them being a trillion company in 5 years. It's a producer, the margin is not that great.

For instance I rarely read financial sources, they are usually full of noise. However I do read a lot about biology, am doing some popular science writing as a hobby. This way I get fresh info that analysts do not. I find tips on obscure companies that others do not know. I read in Genetic litetacy project in  2019 that Aquabounty started its first batch of commercial salmon eggs. I figured that they will get approval if they are so confident, so I bought some Aquabounty. Which increased its price by 40% in a week.

The efficient marker hypothesis has its merits, but is held back by the fact that humans are emotional beings with irrational beliefs and opinions. In the GME example, everyone believed that gamestop was already essentially dead, but the cash flow they brought in was more than capable of allowing the company to continue operating for a reasonable amount of time. People were assigning a 0% chance to a recovery for gamestop. The irrational sentiment allowed the stock price to go much lower than it likly “should” have been, despite the clear possibility of a turnaround. Similarly in the housing market crash, all the information to see it coming was readily available, but people either didnt look or discounted the negative information.

87,TV," Hey take this for what it’s worth. 

I’d imagine the people telling you this are lower to middle class. I say this because everyone has a joy or collection habit. 

Some enjoy collecting shoes, cards, art or just stuff. Some folks pay for Netflix while other subscribe to audible books. 

People pay for gym memberships others use body weight and run outside. 

Folks gamble at casinos and folks gamble in penny stocks. 

Then we have the hobbies. Some peoples hobby is to go out for dinner 20$ a plate others enjoy cooking at home 10$ a plate. 

Some people enjoy reading business news to invest in businesses others watch TV news and are always mad or scared of the next earth destruction. 

If you invest because you like it that’s wonderful. I think you are asking the wrong question. 

You want to know if you are doing the right thing. 

Are you saving money and mad at life?Do you make others pay when you go out? Not tip servers? Or act cheap around others making the same kind of money as you? If so you may be creating a habit of being cheap to invest to be rich at the end of the day that’s being cheap and all the money won’t make you happy. If you have hobbies you enjoy and still save that’s great. Keep investing. 

It’s a balance of how much you make and how you spend. I drive a shitty car so I don’t have a car payment and invest that money. I still fish, bicycle, camp and enjoy life with friends. I don’t go out to eat often, impulse buy Amazon stuff and rarely go to bars to drink.

What’s your lifestyle. What do you enjoy and where do you sacrifice to save. Figure that out and if your not sacrificing what brings you joy you are good. 

People I work with collect shoes and think I’m crazy for collecting stocks. We all play basketball on Wednesdays I always wear the same shoes, some never wear the same shoes 2 times in a couple months. The 150 they spend on shoes I spend on shares of xyz. 

I know this came out as a rant - I am passionate about people saving and don’t like the bay sayers who don’t save making you second guess.

I believe that the market goes through periods of being over-corrected to being in a bubble. Rarely in between, and that's expected because moves tend to be exaggerated due to the level of leverage being used in our stock market.

I use TA to find good entry points in a long position and when I get paid I add money into my account, take notes on how I'm expecting charts of my investments to move to decide when I would like to add to my current positions. 

Since I'm doing long term I look into value based metrics. I'm making sure their market cap hasn't run away from their total revenues, check to be sure there is a strong net margin and strong assests.

142,NYC," This can and probably will be way larger of an impact than expected. I’ve been through the Panama Canal, 18 years USCG experience, 4 years working at NYC ports. I know these situations. 

Sunday is an attempt to free the ship with the highest tide, full moon and all. After that it’s going to be a long haul. Probability of Sunday working is extremely very low. These ships have so much weight and when they run aground they suck into the earth. The physics of lifting them from being stuck is incredibly difficult and it’s not gonna happen here. 

After that failed attempt comes trying to make the ship lighter by removing containers, and deballasting fuel. If you look at the images, the ship isn’t just sitting at a pier with cranes ready to work. So setting up cranes to take off the containers is going to take time. Two weeks atleast. My very educated prediction is it is going to take three weeks minimum to release the ship from blocking the canal. 

Taking off enough containers would take 300-400 barges... that would take months to organize. 

Worst case scenario is the ship is improperly deballasted and it lists or capsizes in the canal. Then we are talking 6 months to clear the ship.

172,DD," I basically did what every noob did. Look at prices and try to buy low and buy things I thought were good or that reddit hyped lmao. Ok but in all actuality that isn't investing. Or anywhere close. 90% of investing advice on social media is speculation. And right now there's a lot of mania much more than before. Don't get me wrong , momentum trading is fun and you can make (ALOT of) money but it's not that different than gambling at least for me. 

Humble yourself on actual fundamentals and how to value a business. Read the intelligent investor or some books from Peter Lynch. You need to know if u are buying something at a fair price , even if you love the company. 'oh but it's the future bro' is speculative.
 https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kheec2/the_ultimate_fundamentals_guide_on_what_you_need


Youtube channels I like:

- Investing with Rose (beginner friendly, personal finance, tax advantaged accounts , probably explains things the best to normal ppl new to it) 

- Learn to invest (fundamentals) 

- The Swedish investor: he summarizes A LOT of investing books in 10 minutes and it's an incredibly rich resource if you have limited time to read books

- Ben Felix tho tldw he will just give you research after research that you should buy total market index funds

 This is also probably the best overall advice you can get from the legend peter Lynch. If there's one simple video that can sum up the best mindset to have imo it is this:

Then the GME incident occurred, and I got an SPY dividend, and those 2 events got me more active and curious about researching stocks; I looked up videos on YouTube and look for commonly repeated points. Anything not repeated often gets put as a fringe idea. Anything that seems to be a popular sentiment gets looked into.
Time in the market is better than timing the market? Yep, numbers are there to prove it.

174,BP," My first real exposure was in history class in jr high. We did a segment on the market crash leading to the great depression and as a part of that the teacher ran a kind of stock simulator group activity. It doesn't sound like a lot, but to me it made a huge impression.

After that, I saw it often as a background in BBS door games (bulletin board systems were kind of a precursor to the internet). I learned how to work the system in these to make quite a lot for my character. It actually taught some good basics but reality doesn't work like bbs games. Also, honorable mention to tradewars because, although it's not stocks, it did provide some foundations that I used later.

In my early twenties, I was given stocks and options as part of my work. I'd say I didn't really understand this stuff at the time but it was the dot com era so it seemed like this was an important aspect of the job. Ultimately, none of this turned out valuable because I worked for companies that failed.

Then I started working in finance (IT systems). As a part of that, I had a 401k match and some stocks but I was pretty passive about things. Then the 2008 crash happened and I decided I really needed to understand this stuff well. I dove in, mostly watched YouTube videos and read a lot of articles videos but I did talk a little with a few members of my family that were in it (this isn't really a big help, tbh. Retrospectively, I think a lot of this advice was crap).

I would make my own spreadsheets, do my own simulations, and started putting my money in. Harkening back to my TradeWars experience, I started looking for black swan events that I could get a contrary options position to in order to capture the recovery. My best one at that time was putting 3k down on some British Petroleum calls a few weeks after they accidentally dumped a bunch of oil in the Gulf of Mexico. That weekend, the US federal government declared they were backstopping the losses BP would take and that trade went to 125k. It went beyond that, even but that's where I sold.

I don't trade like that anymore. I feel 13 years later I'm a lot more sophisticated. It's been a lot of incremental learning, especially from (sometimes expensive) trade mistakes. Still, overall, I'm easily beating the market, I retired in my late thirties several years ago (I'm in my early forties now), and my only real task is managing my money which I've shifted my trade style to not require much active day-to-day work, so that I can really just focus on my family.

Plus, I personally do shorting fairly often; two of my biggest positions right now are shorts and I often hedge against market failure with shorts. I see people calling for blood but I don't think they understand what they are calling for.

That said, there is some bad stuff going on with shorting and it's not just naked shorting that's causing it. The best recent example is AMC where the stick price was pushed down so much that they couldn't get reasonable financing which out then into a position where they may have BKed, so the short was causing itself to be justified which then justified putting a large amount of money into it. But this is not the only case and not all the other companies were so lucky.  It also allows for someone to step in and ""save"" the company for cents on the dollar. There's no doubt that shorting can be predatory.

So, it's a complicated topic with nuance. Not something people deal with well, it seems.",JackLocke366,1,/r/stocks/comments/meatwo/cant_shorting_actually_be_useful/gshcjxw/,0.066,0.809,0.126,0.9192
206,AAPL," The ones I bought were in case of whole market crash. So for example, I bought one AAPL $80 strike price put expiring 9/17. I'm pretty sure I could only lose the price I paid for it ($70 total, I think), in case it expires worthless. But I made sure I had $6000 cash, and my plan if there was a big crash was to buy 100 shares of AAPL at $60 and exercise the option to make $2000 profit. Now theoretically if I have $6000 cash, I could afford 85 of those options...but that seems like it would be quite volatile and probably unwise. Does that sound right?",ss1728,2,/r/stocks/comments/mdz2nb/options_volume/gscnt3f/,0.108,0.759,0.133,0.4404
207,AAPL," Also,  that's a heck of a market crash needed before those would pay off.  Worldwide pandemics are (thankfully) rare, so are world wars.   Those are the types of things that will make big profitable companies lose half their value in six months.   Peak to trough in the great recession 12 years ago was right about 50%.

In that case the option isn't gaining you anything.   If AAPL is at $80 you break even on your option.  You could just buy the shares at $80 without the option.  If it's below $80 as in your example $60, you could buy the shares at $60 and use the option to sell them at $80 for a gain of $20 x 100 (shares per contract) = $2000. .

So assuming a 50% crash every 10 years,  and you're buying six month options (20 contracts over ten years) at $70 each,  you spent $1400 to make $2000 for a total gain of $600 over 10 years. If a major 50% drop doesn't happen for 20 years,  you've spent $2800 to gain $2000 for a $800 loss over 20 years.",bernie638,4,/r/stocks/comments/mdz2nb/options_volume/gscu51v/,0.112,0.771,0.117,0.4774

253,AAPL," Warren's philosophy revolves around value investing and buying what you know. Warren doesn't know tech, and he knows that he doesn't.

Investing is all about risk management; how much risk are you taking on for a realistic reward? What happens if you lose a large portion of your money? I personally don't want to spend an extra five to ten years not retired because of a stupid mistake trying to double my money.

It's not as simple as buying Apple or Microsoft and earning 30% average per year. There were many years where they traded sideways or downwards. Look at Microsoft from 2001 to 2014. Thirteen years of doodoo in terms of equity appreciation. It can happen again.

Many of the companies you see popularized today will not be around in 5 to 10 years. For some reason it is popular to lose money and then try to go public.

I wouldn't hesitate to call myself a value investor. One of my ""top"" holdings is eBay. I don't expect for eBay to 10x overnight, but I do believe that it is fundamentally undervalued, and that it is an e-commerce/tech company that pays a dividend. I'll probably still be holding this company in 10 years, and my dividend yield on cost should be pretty juicy at that point, so long as they continue to up the dividend. eBay is also relatively recession proof, as people will continue to buy and sell on their platform no matter what the economy looks like, which brings risk down.

I'm long MSFT, AAPL and EBAY.

The price of the larger companies you mentioned has a lot to do with how much money they are making. IBM is still a fantastic company, but they don't raise their earnings by much. They have quite a bit of debt based on a quick look at finviz, and their dividend payout ratio looks like it is 103%, which is a little ""uh-oh"", as it means they are paying out more than they can afford to, putting their dividend at risk.

271,ATH," Consider me a Boomer, I guess, but I sold our Disney stocks in January. I missed the $200+ ATH, but I just didn’t see the positives outweighing the negatives. I had been buying Disney regularly since 2009, when it was $19 per share, and I thought the $145ish that it hovered around during the MCU era was a good investment and a reasonable price target. However, with (spoiler alert) Tony Stark dead, Thor fat, and the inability to continue the Spider-Man series, that doesn’t seem to be a solid revenue source. Their CGI movies are becoming a little too cookie cutter, I agree with many of the concerns about their policies and statements, and the parks are both too crowded and too expensive. When you spend a couple hundred dollars to get into the park and then spend 45 minutes waiting in line for one ride (or even one snack), the cost-per-experience is outrageous! You can show me all the analytics you want, but I, personally, don’t see support for a price for Disney of more than $175 per share. I am probably wrong, but I’m willing to live with that and invest my money elsewhere. 

On the other side of the coin, lots of parents and grandparents like the sentiment of buying shares of Disney stock for their kids, so there is some psychological benefit there.  However, if Disney keeps coming up with stupid moves like the “no Winnie the Pooh on tombstones” policy, eventually that will burn up as well.",The_Chubby_Unicorn,0,/r/stocks/comments/mefng0/would_like_some_feedback_on_my_first_ever_dd_dis/gsghldv/,0.088,0.769,0.143,0.908

276,DIS," DIS may have already hit it's ceiling, but I wouldn't say it's because the movies are going to get less popular. Thor won't be fat by the middle of next movie guaranteed and they are still making Spider-Man movies, they just had a slight hiccup with his licensing for a month or two. 

I don't think interest is waning in the parks either, we all know those people that make disney world every vacation ever year. 

At the same time, I don't see interest necessarily increasing in the long term.

But I got in investing late into this 2020 bull run. It was expensive af getting in but I trust them going forward.

From movies in the pipeline to shows, I like the creative decisions they are going for. Disney just have really good creators underneath them, that knows the formula to make great family friendly content. That will never go out of style. With the biggest IPs in entertainment owned by them, it will just benefit their streaming services even more into the future. 5 years from now it could very be likely DIS and HBO have better content than Netflix. Some people already say those two have surpassed Netflix.

On their theme parks.. I hear the complaints about raising prices.. But then you see reports about the attendance on their parks and hotels, along with expansions currently in the works and it gives you confidence about the business moving forward.

They pretty much have a monopoly on family friendly entertainment and media.. I'm holding DIS for a long long time. Adding bit by bit every month.",UnObtainium17,2,/r/stocks/comments/mefng0/would_like_some_feedback_on_my_first_ever_dd_dis/gsh77z2/,0.015,0.751,0.234,0.995

310,USA," >No matter what a parasite real estate agents tell you - There is no way angent can add 5-6% 

in the USA, there is strong data showing that FSBO (For Sale By Owner) properties tend to sell for less than houses sold by an agent. there are many subtle elements of marking and selling a house, and a good agent can help get a better selling price. for example it's a common mistake, at least in America, that sellers believe upgrades to the property increase value dollar for dollar (they think a $10,000 kitchen remodel will add $10,000 or more in value to the sale price). in reality, these types of improvements don't add dollar for dollar value, perhaps 50 cents on the dollar, and people can lose money by spending too much on the wrong improvements. 

but to answer the question, there are American companies offering similar services to what you describe: flat-rate agents who do not charge a percentage. but I'm not aware of any companies that sell stock. house sales are regulated federally and state-by-state, so there are probably many small companies that are not listed.",harrison_wintergreen,3,/r/stocks/comments/mejels/any_companies_trying_to_disrupt_the_real_estate/gshktcp/,0.037,0.864,0.099,0.7783

So, I would expect people who have shorted to stock will want to close their positions before the merger, because the partial shares paid out as cash in the merger would work a lot like a dividend, where the person shorting the shares would have to pay it out themselves.

376,IMO," In the end, yes other companies will start to catch up to tesla's battery technology. But how many cars will those other companies actually produce in 5, 10, 15 years? How many batteries can they produce? Tesla is aiming for 20 million cars a year by 2030-35. & they're producing their own batteries. You can build a prototype but it's your ability to scale that will differentiate the winners from the losers in the EV race IMO. & it's pretty evident, to me anyways, that tesla is in the lead in that respect.",Individual_Line_8673,3,/r/stocks/comments/mdz868/tesla_outlook/gscvx01/,0.044,0.788,0.169,0.9211

379,IQ," Let me try to elaborate. That dude is one of the few self made billionaires and it’s all IQ and results, no real charisma to speak of. Not a guarantee for success but still something to think about. The guy announced he is leaving for Mars before he dies, he drew up a roadmap and is currently ahead of it. I don’t know who’s in his team but they convinced more than one government of a economic superpower to get him all sorts of subsidies for all his companies. His factories are off grid and if global warming keeps fucking shit up carbon tax will become reality and every manufacturer out there will be happy to work with him. That’s just one of the many things he has going for him. I’m not saying Tesla’s valuation is reasonable I just wouldn’t put my money on a bet that he will fail. He might die but other than that I don’t see him suddenly loose all his drive to change the world as he is already.",mimo_s,1,/r/stocks/comments/me11cn/elons_pumps_lost_its_effect_totally_unsuitable_as/gsdf2zh/,0.122,0.824,0.055,-0.9163
