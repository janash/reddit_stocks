112,ALL," You’re giving it 6-7 years before a collapse! No way. 6-7 months. There are plenty of catalysts that could cause it. One less likely being a grounding supply of everything due to no microchip production from a China v Taiwan, N Korea v S Korea, situation. More likely scenario is a government default this year with the current house makeup. The banking system spiraling out of control internationally is a concern. Or hell, Putin going full madman and actually using nukes. 

Now that was all cataclysmic shit…. Here are the scary and real facts. The fact that In the last quarter of 2022, credit card balances increased by $61 billion to $986 billion, a record high of ALL TIME. 

Fact 2: The rate at which Americans are saving money has dipped close to an all-time low, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The personal savings rate was 2.3% as of October, down from 7.3% a year earlier. It’s the lowest since July 2005, when the rate hit a record low of 2.1%. The recession then arguably began as early as 2007 to a degree. Once mass layoffs hit in the next few months we’ll start seeing these freshly laid off Chad’s and Megan’s that ran up their credit card debt on grain free, gluten free organic dog food and all the other necessary shit like Pelotons and 400 sets Lulemon athletic ware because 70% of their income was going to that house they bought for $100k over asking at a 6.5% mortgage rate and the have no savings left because of the down payment and “investments” in Bitcoin at $65,000 a coin… will have to file for credit card bankruptcy, default on their mortgage and move their ass and their dog stella into the basement of their parent’s home.

There was no practical way to determine whose business was severely impacted and whose wasn’t without it taking months and months. They the only thing that could get it out in time to help, gave it to everyone, those who needed it and those who didn’t. 

Bad policy is like lies. You tell the first one and then a bunch more to try and cover it. 

IMO the majority of lockdowns and business restrictions were a mistake. Then we needed ppp loans. And direct stimulus payments. And super low interest rates, and bond buying. 

Which led to super high inflation, which means we have to jack ip rates to try and kill it. And now banks are failing.

People said the same shit about the insane growth of tesla and now look at tesla. a 50% drop from peak. and tesla had a similar share price expansion even after dropping from the top, where the peak of 400 was tested with a second peak at 360 (10% drop)

meanwhile NVDA has all the same telling signs - insane hype, insane fomo, only 20% from the peak, all based on AI hype (tesla was based on EV hype).

NVDA will be $200 a share or less by the end of this year. And it won't go above 300 by much, if at all this year.

If you need any more proof of that, just look at the simple fact that Cramer is now bullish on NVDA.

Right now they sell gaming hardware and datacenter gpus.


In the next year they will add SW revenue for AIaaS, SW revenue for Cloud AI training, SW revenue for licensing proprietary AI models. On the rendering side they are seeing adoption with animation and rendering,  that means big companies like Disney giving them revenue to buy hardware and license animation software,  it means smaller animation studios subscribing to their new Omniverse Cloud. 

Not to mention they continue to make waves in the datacenter in networking equipment, which while saturated and not new, is still a huge revenue driver with annual renewals. 

By 2030 they will have GPUs in every cars and robots all around the world.


You can argue they are overvalued, but there is a huge amount of growth opportunity they are set to take with minimal competition across new hardware areas, new software areas,  and AI Cloud.

171,NVDA," Which is why book value makes no sense as a valuation metric in the context of NVDA, similarly to (but for different reasons than) P/E. Which is my point. P/E is a useful metric for evaluating mature/value companies, and for comparing companies within the same industry against each other. But simply citing P/E as a reason to say that NVDA is overvalued is, by itself, of very little value. 

And for the record, I have no opinion on the price of NVDA. My point is that the arguments used in this thread, such as a high P/E, to assert that NVDA is overvalued (which it may well be!), are not sound arguments.",i_am_law,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11y5890/nvda_got_me_feeling_like/jd8fn78/,0.098,0.824,0.078,-0.5255

Not at all similar to a student loan - since there is no loan in this case. And using that example just makes you look illiterate on this subject.

0 new dollars were created in this “bailout” and the parties that indulged in risk have been completely liquidated at a loss - the shareholders who made a horrible investment in these banks. 

Not the depositors who were just doing what the Fed has told them to do - save their money away instead of spending/loaning it out to drive up inflation.",MiltonFreidmanMurder,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11yr33g/fed_hikes_rates_by_a_quarter_percentage_point/jd9bri9/,0.106,0.825,0.069,-0.6666

189,OP," Great post OP.  Here's where I'm guessing we're heading:

-The Fed pauses hikes tomorrow saying the banking crisis reflects the lag effect of previous hikes.  This will be sold as a bank stability move, but it's really just allowing inflation to stay high, which the Fed has been doing since early 2021.

-Market rallies for the next six months.  

-Inflation slows, but not enough.  The poors continue to get crushed.

-Some big fucker (bank, country, corporation) busts a SVB in Q4.  Central banks step in again.  Contagion spreads, central banks step in again and again.

-Inflation stays high, but central banks scream ""what about stability?!?!"" and lower rates.

-Inflation takes off again, the whole process repeats over and over for several years.

Why all this bull shit?  Inflation is the only way to escape all the money printing.  Central banks are only pretending to address inflation.  Don't believe it?  For the last 1.5 years the Fed has been ""surprised"" by inflation every fucking Fed meeting.  Surprisingly sticky durable goods, then food, wage gains, used car prices, new car prices, now rent, next PCE take your fucking pick.

Central banks are letting inflation bleed the poors because it's the lowest political impact.  200 million people poorer due to inflation is a soft landing.  100 banks failing (and the wealthy depositors) is a crash.  The Fed won't let a crash occur.  

PS I got my money on T1 bonds being the straw that breaks the markets back.  I'm guessing people are dumping them hard after what happened at Credit Suisse.",Omnipotent-Ape,178,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11y532y/how_i_know_were_in_for_a_shit_storm/jd6eg7f/,0.177,0.76,0.063,-0.9893
190,OP," OP is right that we’re in for a world of pain. Capitalism never intended so many to have so much wealth. The Fed didn’t see this coming with QE, and there’s nothing they can do now but pick favorites and burn the rest down. I’ll explain…

All of the highly regarded folks here know the drill: the central bank printed a gazillion dollars of low interest “loans” for their big tech sector friends to use for stock buybacks. Normally these sorts of stimmies just go right into the hands of the elites and institutions, but the fiscal planners sorta forgot that tech companies had been paying their employees in stock for decades. Suddenly, everyone from Amazon’s drone engineers to Bill Gates’ massage therapist could afford a million dollar home in Seattle and a not-yet-on-fire Tesla X.

The proof is in the hockey tickets. It’s cheaper for me to fly to LA, stay in a hotel, and watch the Kraken beat the Kings on vacation, than it is for me to stay here in the rain and watch the Kraken lose at home. The price of everything in Seattle is just imaginary at this point, and it’s all because of the tech bro stock money. My friends and even my wife’s boyfriend are all programmers and they just buy random shit like limited edition Warhammer figurines and thousand dollar red-light therapy devices because “what else am I doing with my money?”

So the growth really is trickling to the bottom for the first time, thanks to COVID. With a million people dead and millions of extra retireds since the pandemic, we’re seeing $21/hr burger flippers. It’s still not enough to survive in newly-expensive Seattle, but it’s a financial bellwether and it’s crushing businesses whose pricing structures are inelastic.

The only way to bring down the price of everything from homes and Tesla’s and hockey tickets is to remove money from the system. “They” can’t take it from their friends—the truly wealthy—so the central bankers need to kick the legs out from under anyone with disposable income. Since so much of that income was shifted from the central banks to stonks, then stonks to real estate, it’s only logical that real estate takes the next big hit. Can’t have these tech bros with access to home equity loans or selling their million dollar six-hundred square foot shack, because that just furthers inflation. Remove the equity, keep the debt, create debt slaves in a company town.

This is war on the newly created wealth and those who touch it. The central bankers released the genie and can’t get it back in the lamp without putting us all in bread lines. These RV camps and shanty towns around west coast tech cities are nothing compared to what we’re going to see soon.",MagickalFuckFrog,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11y532y/how_i_know_were_in_for_a_shit_storm/jd74ls0/,0.074,0.843,0.083,0.6712

They should have sold at a small loss when the first rate hike happened and took a bad qtr.  now they are stuck holding the bag because they didn’t want to disappoint shareholders/partners so I guess it’s better to completely fail than make a mistake?

318,GME," This company turned a $48M profit after cutting costs $85M.

The cuts cost them about $28M in revenue (so far).

They sold off an extra $230M of inventory to, again, profit $48M.

The stock gained roughly $2.5B in market cap.

The actual profitability can be attributed to:

-Cost cutting.
-Inventory slashing.

The problem is, they can only cut costs and clear out inventory so much.

This isn’t some bullish signal.  They had to cut costs by ~16% and sell through ~26% of their inventory to turn a paltry 2% profit on revenue.  They can’t do this every quarter.

Again, the stock gained $2.5B in value on this shit.

My buddy owns a moving company that turns 1/4 of the GME profit annualized.  If someone came to him and valued his company at $7.5B, he’d sell the entire business in a blink and STILL offer you 50% off for the hassle of offering.

612,OP," I understand the wash sale rule, but, again, OP completely closed all his positions in Nov.  There are no wash sales remaining.

Also one more time, do you think the wash sale means you can end up in Nov with all your positions closed in an account you started with $60k that ends with $0 and have anything other than a $60k lose?   If you believe you can end up with a $2M gain in that scenario then you don't understand the wash sale rule.  


As for the article, read the part where it says:  
"" they’ve generated those losses within 30 days of a purchase, those losses get suspended,” [explained ](https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report/robinhoods-surge-complicates-tax-season-for-couch-traders)Sandi Bragar, managing director at Aspiriant.""

How long do you think wash sales get suspended.   The answer is until you sell for the last time.  Close the position and don't open a new one in that security and the wash sale turns into a real loss.   He closed his account in Nov, it was at $0 according to him.
