For investors who are more active or day traders (gamblers) who are more time sensitive, then Robinhood is not a good fit at all!!

> Just like FB and others, you are essentially the product that is being pawned around, except in this case, you have your own dollars at stake. 

What kind of fresh BS is this? Think about it. How does FB treat you like a product? Think... by getting your personal info and selling that to the advertisers. Why is that bad? It's bad because the advertisers can use it to break a demography.

> But if you are not their customer, you are likely not getting the attention you deserve as an investor. The sleek look and ease to use is just to make the product more lucrative for their actual clients. 

Note carefully how you contradict yourself in your own sentences! And they're not even far apart. Consequitive sentences.

""you are likely not getting"" - doesn't give me shit. Anything can be likely. It's likely that your bank might get hacked and close down. You see how stupid ""likely"" is by itself? You have to give something more concrete than that. You're just unnecessarily trying to be paranoid.

And then in the next sentence you praise them ""sleek look"" and ""ease to use"". So they do provide you some value. And not like they're gonna eat up your money. They're going to return it back, right? Think about it. So far you've not brought up anything that they're doing wrong.

> but a company who‚Äôs core competency is software development, and not equities trading, I‚Äôd think twice. 

More paranoia without saying anything concrete. How about I wouldn't trust the advice of someone on reddit because their core competency is reddit more than stock trading? 

> IRA? Sorry. I haven‚Äôt looked into why specifically, but it likely doesn‚Äôt generate the same money as a brokerage account.  

What are you talking about? A brokerage account has you paying for the trades you make. You don't ""generate"" money like bitcoins or plants. You trade money for stock or vice versa. A stupid use of words.

I do not know of any retail brokerage houses that have free online trades that does NOT sell orderflow. Robbinhood was a leader in making these game changing moves.

As for who is the customer? Seriously. If I hear that argument one more time..

Been in the market for 30 years and there has NEVER been a better time to be a retail investor. Just because you dont understand how it works is your issue. Robin hood did NOTHING wrong other than being a bit under capitalized.  Every retail brokerage (free trades) restricted trading, and have done it many times.

I was never restricted on TD. Why? Because I dont leverage my ass like you kids do.

1. To be options-approved, you must set your Risk Tolerance profile to ‚ÄúMost Aggressive‚Äù. I set mine to one notch below Most Aggressive because I‚Äôm not out here naked short selling, so my initial options request was denied after pending for about a week üôÑüôÑüôÑ

2. I changed the Risk Tolerance and re-submitted for Options Level 2 (I only occasionally buy a long call or put with intent to exercise it). It took a couple a weeks, and they only approved Level 1.

3. Immediately resubmitted and they approved Level 2 after a week or so. Then I submitted my ACAT transfer out of RH.

Hopefully that helps some people. Also, after phoning Fidelity, apparently as soon as you‚Äôre approved at any level of options trading, they‚Äôll accept any inbound options on a transfer; they‚Äôll only allow you to close those positions but not reopen a similar one thru Fidelity until you‚Äôre approved at the proper level. I didn‚Äôt know that at the time, but don‚Äôt delay a transfer once you‚Äôre approved for options at some level, because I spent all of February with my holding sitting in RH unnecessarily.

Much happier in Fidelity though. Great info for proper valuations and things like that, and they don‚Äôt breach breach their fiduciary duty to their investors just so Daddy‚Äôs margin call isn‚Äôt so bad.

It's all very pie-in-the-sky with **no** basis in reality.

I'd like to expand on the cult thing. This following that has developed behind $GME displays multiple signs of cultish behavior:

1. Imposing rigid rules or regulations (Hold! Don't sell! Keep buying the dip/hold the line!)
2. Minimize/discourage/defame outside news sources (That FINRA short interest report is a lie! It's actually much higher! It's rigged!)
3. Make extensive use of cult-generated information (All the jerkoff DD that's posted without *any* balanced view. Anything else is generated by a paid Melvin/Citadel/Santa Claus shill)
4. Extensive use of cult-specific lingo (HODL! APES STRONG TOGETHER! üíéüôå üöÄ! HOLD THE LINE!)
5. Instill fear of the ""other"" group/outside world (Everyone that dissents is a HF shill! They just want you to sell!)

And that's not even hitting on all the points. It's the financial version of Qanon at this point.

Any returns you've already made on $GME were a once-in-a-generation thing, it's not going to happen again. The original short interest was closed between January and present, and any open short interest now are sellers that entered after that. Until $GME fixes their shit, based on financials, it is **not** worth more than $20, and that's being generous.

5 or 10 years down the road? *Maybe*, but not anywhere near current price levels. But until they get their shit together, it's going to eventually settle down into the $20 - $30ish range and stay there. Get out of $GME (and the cult) while you still have profit. The point of the market is to make money, and if you invest emotionally, you're going to lose a fuckton of money.

275,AA," I'm American and have no debt really either. Maybe $600 for a drum set. Like.. thing is, you don't *need* to go to school here to make a decent wage, and you can basically get your AA for free and then transfer at a *massively* reduced cost due to doing great on your AA.

I had a 3.75 and honors degree and worked two part time jobs without a car. You don't think a college will take me on a discounted rate? C'mon now...

The problem is... people arent taught how to live life *now* as opposed to when school was hyper-cheap 30 years ago.

Like... if you simply work for awhile in something decent paying that costs little to get into from debt relief to insurance, to plumbing or electrician work you will be fine. Furthermore, you'll have a good retirement if you're frugal and live within your means. Then you get your AA for damn near free, slay the game, go get the last two years at a reputable public university and only end up maybe 20gs in debt when you make 40-70g+ a year after.

It's a harsh lesson when we tell young people to jump into debt and don't actually teach them how to manage their debt etc., or other proper paths instead of school as well.

321,GM," Thanks, there doesn't need to be publicly recorded instruments to smell something that reeks.

I get your point. It was the more than likely in the terms of GM's loan to them to purchase the building. I'm searching for further actual proof, seeing it says it was a memo from GM which is being mentioned because GM refused to release the terms of the loan. 

I'm on neither side here but let's use logic. GM does not care about any community , they care about money. Even if they were attempting to help the community , this is far from the best or most obvious way to do that. Why would you lose that much money on a building, GM especially, it's not Google. GM has a limited run here and they're not stupid, they're not going to just give up a building worth a billion dollars. That buildings value is a literal lifeline for them, that is of course if the value is even valid. As far as I know, that area of Ohio is basically Detroit. Real estate is a joke , you can have a building ""valued"" at a million dollars as it sits there completely empty for 20 years until they finally demolish it. Value has lost it's actual meaning, which is what people will pay for it.  


I see GM using Lordstown Motors as their way of staying relevant. One of their biggest issues is unions and this is a clear as day way of avoiding unions. That building has been vacant for like a year, and they didn't even attempt to sell it for a realistic price as far as I can see.",bobbrucethe1st,2,/r/stocks/comments/m7f4h7/hindenburg_research_is_about_to_get_taken_for_a/grbqi2j/,0.082,0.798,0.12,0.9245

All I can say is that not everything is a conspiracy. If everyone is negative about this company, it's a very real possibility that there's a reason for that. The CEO incriminating himself on national TV certainly doesn't help.

That said, I'm not trying to convince you or anything. You seem to know the risks you're getting into.

They were given a chance to get out before the company went bankrupt - without his reports how would they have found out? Enron was a huge house of cards that went on for years screwing over its customers and employees - had Jim not stepped in how long would that scam have continue to go on? 

The short attack on Enron took place over most of 2001, it was not an immediate one-off report that made the stock drop. Short sellers definitely need to be reigned in - no argument from me there. Most short sellers are shady actors - but how is that different from Chamath / Elon jumping in to try to pump GME or Dogecoin on Twitter to their thousands of followers? Both are forms of market manipulation and should be investigated by the SEC. But there have been short sellers that have uncovered some massive frauds that the SEC or any other governing body was obviously not able to uncover.

PLTR is a very very long-term play.  Think a decade or greater into the future.

People expecting big gains this month, or in a year, or even 5 years, probably should stay away.  

Anyone who can't stomach occasional short term share price decreases of 50% should probably stay away.

396,TSLA," 5 years ago, I think most investors believed that TSLA was overpriced and not going anywhere.  Tesla spent the 2010's developing battery technology, manufacturing techniques, software, custom silicon, and much more.  All the groundwork and the hiring of tens of thousands of employees didn't begin to show consistent financial benefits until the last half of 2019.  

Palantir is sort of in the same situation.  They've invested nearly 2 decades and a lot of investor capital into developing their software platform.  Last year's financial results hint that their business model could be viable and very successful in the long run, although they aren't there yet. 

My basic argument: even if a company's financials look poor, look at what they've built, and consider the long term possibilities.  I think Palantir has built something with a lot of potential.  Is it risky?  Absolutely.  But their product is unique in its capabilities and ease of deployment.  As an institution, Palantir has smart, ambitious, and mission driven people at its core.

The difference between a 4x return and a 30x return is substantial. 

There‚Äôs obviously less risk buying in when the company has become a surer bet.

429,AMD," Nice writeup, not too long and a good categorization of pros and cons.

I have written about NVDA a few times before, I am long since 2019 with a cost basis of $139.50. For a long time, NVDA was about 5% of my portfolio (I prefer to hold about 20 high conviction, long-term companies in my portfolio at any given time) but recently, NVDA as a position has now fallen to more like 2-3% of my portfolio. I would therefore also like to add more (at least double my position), but I am apprehensive about the valuation (the obvious time to add would have been in March 2020, duh...).

Anyway, I do believe that Nvidia can eventually easily get to $100B+ in annual revenues. I work in a ""niche"" field that's not quite cloud, HPC or gaming but has similar technology requirements and I foresee a version of the future where the ARM-based Nvidia DPUs dominate the generic backend compute that is still dominated by x86 today (Intel and AMD). This is also the reason why I am not nearly as bullish on AMD as I am on Nvidia. Also as a side note, we use Mellanox NICs and they are a great company/team and a technology leader in what they do (I prefer their NICs over e.g. Solarflare).

To summarize, I am starting to think that I might have been wrong about the valuation with Nvidia and indeed missed some good buying opportunities during the last 6-8 months when it was available for below $500 (even after the post March 2020 recovery). Just to explain myself better, I do consider myself a value investor and typically the earnings multiple is one of the first things I look at. A lot (but not all) of my other 5% holdings are more classic ""value"".

And just to clarify something, the thing is, from a purely quantitative POV,  40x forward earnings is not insanity... at 20% annual earnings growth, price-to-earnings multiples up to 40 (or even 50) can be acceptable (see ""Security Analysis"" by Graham et al). It's all about what the risk is with respect to the company being able to maintain its current earnings growth trajectory.

The $300B EV might be another thing that understandably turns people off, but obviously at some point Nvidia can start accelerating stock buybacks.

FWIW, I am not adding yet at these levels, but I am seriously thinking about it.

P.S. One thing about Nvidia is that it's not a SW company so it doesn't have SW company margins or ROC/ROA. However, part of its moat is the barrier of entry and uniqueness in the competitive space. Like you said, a risk is that the IaaS companies / cloud providers will use their profits to design and build their own chips (in that scenario, ARM is still a major winner though).",snake250,1,/r/stocks/comments/m7qyyy/nvidia_nvda_is_a_great_long_term_investment/greflxm/,0.042,0.828,0.13,0.9934

I own more Softbank than NVDA and honestly I thought NVDA got a really good deal on ARM, felt like it's worth more than what they agreed to. There's one element to the deal that's sort of gotten swept under the rug which is that there's a semi-autonomous Chinese sales office, which had full access to the intellectual property, that went rogue last year. The office in London tried to fire the guy in charge and he just refused and kept running it.

433,PEG," Thanks,

I agree with your point re DPU's, and the PE's. To your point the PEG (Price Earnings to Growth ratio) is as important as the PE. 

Peter Lynch used the PEG extensively throughout his 13 years at Magellan.
The forward PE of 34 (price $530/Jan 2023 earnings of 15.85) = 34, divided by the 19.11% earnings growth for Jan 2023 (34/19.11)= PEG ratio of 1.76.

Basically you're paying 1.76X growth, this further drops to 1.34 and 0.83, an additional two years out.

I'm usually comfortable with a PEG of around 2 for high growth companies, provided I can see it coming down below 1 in 2-3 years.

Also given the high valuation and the rise in interest yields, I'm accumulating on declines, only bought about 25% yesterday and put in a limit of $500 for another 25%.

Nvidia is one of those ""Peter Lynch""-style investments that I have because it's related to what I do for work. The other two are STX and WDC.

I guess my thoughts aren't really about how stocks can grow, but about what is needed if we want to rely solely on renewable energy. Without long-term storage we will still need either biomass or fossil fuels combined with CCS to deal with the seasonal ramp up and down of energy production. This or perhaps modular nuclear power.

An issue already addressed in the Monday statement. And readdressed again today by the EMA. To the same effect.


>the benefits of the vaccine in combating the still widespread threat of COVID-19 (which itself results in clotting problems and may be fatal) continue to outweigh the risk of side effects;

>the vaccine is not associated with an increase in the overall risk of blood clots (thromboembolic events) in those who receive it;

>there is no evidence of a problem related to specific batches of the vaccine or to particular manufacturing sites;

>however, the vaccine may be associated with very rare cases of blood clots associated with thrombocytopenia, i.e. low levels of blood platelets (elements in the blood that help it to clot) with or without bleeding, including rare cases of clots in the vessels draining blood from the brain (CVST).


To put this into context, there have been 36 reported cases of thrombocytopenia for the 17 million doses of the Astrazeneca jab delivered - an occurrence rate of ~0.0002%.

Thrombocytopenia is also a rare side effect of taking paracetemol - the most common painkiller consumed in the UK, occurring in less than ~0.01% of patients.

567,AA," We had just rolled a huge 401(k) Dec 2019.  We were just investing it in Jan/early Feb 2020.  The bond portion went up 7-8% within a matter of 5-6 weeks.  I told my advisor I wanted to sell them all and go shopping because by March 17th everything was on sale.  The timing couldn't have been better.  My advisor said no because of our financial situation and the VIX.  I still disagreed.  I took what cash that wasn't invested yet and bought airlines, restaurants, cruise, oil, all sorts of stocks.  I watched those bonds go down over the past 10 months to either where they were or below.  When I met with the finacial advisor, he again said bonds and in particular, TLT is where I want to be.  I told him when I open my porfolio I hate 2 holdings, TLT and EDV.  As my brother who works in the bond market told me bonds is not where you want to be right now.  And he related it to every 10 years it works.  I continued to see them drop even on a big market drop, gold, silver, bonds, stocks, nothing was safe, it all dropped.  I dumped all my silver and still have some gold and got rid of every single bond. I had 2-5 year, 10 year, 20+ year.  I got rid of them all.  The thing my brother did was actually buy the bonds.  He bought, I think AA.  That has a huge rate and as the rates dropped the value of the bond goes up.  Maybe you want to own the bond(s) itself, because they are paying a great rate.  I bought some LQD and plan to add more, even so, down 5%.  I think there is a time to own TLT but I would go back in when rates are much higher.  And I get it you are writing covered calls and using options to shore up or improve the position or hedge against the position.  That's getting above my pay grade and the learning curve it too long for me.  Like I said, I'll go back in but I don't have a reason to right now.

\- "" There is always a chance of them doing more offerings, although I don‚Äôt see that happening personally. "" - No, CEO made clear that they did not plan it in the near future

\-  **Acquisitions:** One of the european ones will be a producer of machines, prop. central or eastern europe, to help them reducing their time to market for Dragonfly NG

584,FI," Having heard that ""first 100k is a bitch"" statement many times - just going to chime in that it was a shift in perceptions towards money which paved the way for my portfolio's growth.

At about the 100k mark... any comparative feelings towards those in proximity seemed moot (Currently 32, working as a research analyst - but going to do a PhD or second master's soon!)

Guess if there had to be a number associated with the moment growth started to compound visibly - would be around 62k ish.

The initial 8-20k was difficult simply due to wanting to spend it on a car downpayment or something.... I had to learn to ""love"" money and change my field of view, think sunglasses in the movie ""they live"".

Budgeting and going FI was a lot easier in the west with less overt peer pressure- after moving to the Far East with an image based society i've found *everything* and *everyone* is scrutinized.

I'm the same way, checking my portfolio too often, wanting to make the big gains, etc. (fuck options atm, too scary, practicing with papermoney currently). But it takes a lot of time for the gains and compounding returns.

624,SE," TM is on my short list.  

They are a solid vehicle manufacturer selling vehicles globally.  This also means that they have a stream of income from the parts market they manufacture as well (at least until the OEM market catches up).  People who buy a Toyota often buy yet another and another.  Brand loyalty is a good thing.  Their vehicles are catered to the markets, such as small diesels in SE Asia, but also not supplying those to the US American market and focusing on gasoline engines. 

But I do not see them growing as phenomenally as Tesla, nor being a Tesla killer.  The Toyota Prius wasn't first to the market, and the plug-in version was a flop.  The Hybrid Prius was great (apart from the battery failures) and used by Steve Wozniak to go 105MPH in his.

Here's the reasons why NOT to buy them:

* Slow to capitalize on innovation such as electric cars and an autopilot
* Lack of breadth, TSLA has SpaceX, Solar City and the Boring company in the news
* Their flagship Lexus (LS) is little difference in price from a Tesla Model S, but you're not going to find many buyers.  The Tesla Model 3 has more features than a Camry and is considered ""cool""
* Killing desirable models such as the Supra, leaving the title to the NSX

They are going to run into the same battery issue as TSLA, while TSLA has not only locked up a supply chain from Panasonic, but built out their Gigafactory in Sparks NV (which is running at full capacity if I do recall) manufacturing batteries.  TSLA is also building out factories in Texas, Germany and China.

I actually went looking at the Lexus LS (online shopping) last night and though it did carry a modest $79K premium, it came with features such as the traffic-aware-cruise-control.  The speed of the sedan wasn't great at 4.6s in 0-6 and years back it would cost more than $140K for the top of the line edition pushing me to the S-class MBZ.

627,ICE," Toyota is a laggard on EVs because their CEO considers the industry overhyped, is concerned about the jobs and business model associated with all their ICE cars, and is very concerned about the high cost of transitioning the grid to be able to handle the load of an EV fleet, particularly in Japan. He would prefer going down the hydrogen fuel cell route. It will be harder than people think to change from ICE to EV as profit disappears from the service side and shifts elsewhere. 

Toyota is working on solid state batteries but so are many others. If the tech was solved this year, they may be able to scale it up meaningfully towards the end of this decade. I don't expect to see it in scale until next decade. If they wait for new tech before investing in battery production at scale, they'll be left behind this decade.

I would take VW over TM as #2 to Tesla. They are going down the right path based on their recent power day presentation imo. They are following a similar path to Tesla but much slower. They're bringing battery production in-house but will still only be at less than 1/10th of Tesla capacity in 2030.

649,SM," Because you can't h ave infinite growth. Do you realize why the reason why things increase in ""value"" is because the dollar actually becomes less valuable? A house doesn't actually increase in value, it just gets harder to buy.

&#x200B;

Lets say you make 100k a year and you want to buy a 100k house... so you start working for a year to save up... but by the end of the year the house costs 200k. Do you see the problem? You are never going to get that house!

&#x200B;

For example, I posted in WSB that maybe WSB was a scam by HF's or others to convince retail to bet everything on these stocks so they could steal it(basically pump and dump)... comment was immediately removed. No one knows if some post by some account is legit or not. For all we know most of the posts about YOLOing could be fake just to hype the stock to retail.

The stock market is being manipulated, that is fact. You end up with people/HF's with multiple accounts playing both sides: 1. They buy X shares on one account and short X shares on the other. They buy slow and short fast. This drives down stock. Anything that the stock does they break even except for interest. By by doing this they can 2: make the stock go up and down in predicable waves and take retail investors money who can't hang on.

Then throw in all the media manipulation and you  end up turning the economy in to a casino. It's no longer a legit place to invest. Even if Warren Buffet is making money he's still losing some because everything is tied together. Devaluation takes over screwing everything up and the people that lose the most are the poor. The wealth gap increases and the rich get more power to screw over society(buy off more politicians, rig the system more, etc). You think this can keep going?

It's not a SM crash that is the problem, it's an economy crash that sends us back 200 years. That almost happened in 2008. Each time it gets more likely to happen(it's almost as if it is intentionally being done to bring down America but one can almost attribute it to greed).",EternalDissonance,1,/r/stocks/comments/m7yebl/why_do_people_always_seem_to_be_saying_the_market/gredrau/,0.124,0.784,0.092,-0.9571
650,PEG," Two points: firstly, the existence of a market means that the buyer is always the marginal buyer, so values are always at the edge of what the most optimistic person thinks it is.

Second, and more importantly, I think your question has to do with valuations. We're seeing PE, PEG, and other valuation ratios significantly higher than historical averages.

I think much of what is driving the markets is a consensus that earnings don't matter, and that this is generally being driving by the fact that borrowing is so cheap, that you can just sort of build/bet on a young company without having to recoup costs quickly.

There is a lot of throwing around the term ""unprecedented"" but these low interest rates are [genuinely unprecedented](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-history-of-interest-rates-over-670-years/). 

The consequences are that these valuations (this market) will likely not fare well when people don't want to loan out their money for essentially nothing. Inflation concerns see to be driving that.

I think you're misunderstanding how the market works. I can put in a limit order for $136 on aapl, and the companies total worth will jump 10% (or a 100 billion dollars in market cap). There doesn't have to be 100 billion in new investments for it to grow by that amount. 

The OC was on the money until he detoured into crazy town with all the pyramid scheme nonsense. 

A company can not grow and still earn 7% for investors. All we're doing is paying for the rights to future cash flows. A company that doesn't grow can trade at a PE of 15 and generate 7% in returns via buybacks and dividends or stock appreciation due to growing the balance sheet.

There's a hurdle rate that is set by the market. If it's too low, then people won't invest - this was generally the mechanics of the dot com bust, people saw 6% treasuries and started wondering why it was worth considering the stock market at a PE of 50.

7% is probably lofty from the current valuations though. It'll likely be in the 5-6% range going forward.",beerion,4,/r/stocks/comments/m7b4xn/isnt_exponential_consistent_growth_with_no/grarw99/,0.047,0.886,0.067,0.3182

829,UPS," As an Amazon and EBay seller, I have heard great things about the Shipstation interface, and god would I love to charge all my shipping costs to my credit card and earn 5x points. But the big thing that holds most Amazon sellers back from using it is Amazon will hold the liability for any orders that are lost or delayed by the carrier if they are bought through Amazon‚Äôs buy shipping program. That means if I buy through Amazon and USPS loses the package which they did a lot this year, when the customer gets refunded for missing the fulfillment promise the money comes out of Amazons pocket not the sellers. Until USPS gets as reliable as UPS, that‚Äôs going to be a very important consideration. Also Amazon passes on much better rates on UPS than many sellers can get on their own. I‚Äôm not quite sure what level of volume you would need to get comparable rates, it tends to be something that is negotiated on an individual basis. So when I sell on other marketplaces my personal preference is using Pirate Ship for USPS. They are free compared to I think about $80 a month with shipstation. They integrate with EBay beautifully and anywhere they don‚Äôt integrate with its an easy cut and paste. I think the rise of Shopify sites and other marketplaces will bode well for Shipstation, but they are going to have trouble acquiring primarily Amazon sellers as well as smaller sellers for whom their fees are too high compared to free options.",ohmymother,1,/r/stocks/comments/m7vbsf/stampscomstmp_before_the_train_leaves/grdznke/,0.056,0.807,0.137,0.9521

Usually I try to be as cautious as possible investing, and I followed EA ever since their dip in 2018.

Scaling back down on some of their business practises, making games players are interested in, fixing their reputation with investors and a few other factors make them a promising investment, if everything goes right of course.

Some big, widely awaited games are coming out this year, and EA appears to try not to mess up this time. Investing in what interests me isn‚Äôt a good idea, I don‚Äôt care about most companies, but in the eyes of an investor, EA is a prospect to keep an eye on for long term.

When you have a cash account, you are limited by your own cash. If you have 5000$ you can buy 5000$ of stocks. The broker cannot and will not lend you money. 

When you have a margin account, you no longer have only your cash, but the cash of your broker too, and that is known as buying power. 

With 5000$ and no other securities on your portofolio you'd have around 20000$ buying power.(at least on IBKR)

You can use those 20k to buy shares or other securities, BUT only if your broker agrees(and this is the important part - the Broker must be willing to lend you money on THAT security(which is known as a marginable security)). And even if he agrees, he may put a different leverage percent based on the type of security(KO is way more stable than GME for example)

There are 3 important metric that you also need to consider:

1) Initial Margin - the amount I need to put down to OPEN a trade(how much money I block)
2) Maintenance Margin - the minimum required to maintain the position open
3) Net Liquidation Value - the total portofolio value as of now (that is, if you close all trades RIGHT NOW, that much cash you will have on your account)

2) Maintenance Margin:0
3) Net Liquidation Value: 5000$
4) Buying Power: 20000$
5) Current Cash: 5000$

4) Buying power: 10000
5) Current Cash: -5000$ (you had to borrow 5000 from IBKR to finish the transaction, so now you OWE them 5000$)

Why Initial and Maintenance Margin matter? 

When your NLV gets below CIM, you cannot open new trades, you cannot even roll over options, even for a credit if it is too much below.

887,IRS," Negative. Your cost basis changes by the amount of the disallowed gain on the next buy. 

You have to think of everything in cost basis. 

The examples are all wrong because it doesn't have an initial cost basis. Start over:

Step 1) You sell 1 share of a stock for $150 with a cost basis of $100. Realized gain $50.

Step 2) You buy the same ticker @$151 and sell @ $146 with a cost basis of  $151. Realized loss is $5. If you stop here, then at tax time, you are taxed on $45 net capital gain ($50, above, minus this $5).

Step 3) You then buy the same ticker @ $125.  Your $5 loss from above is disallowed as a wash sale. If you stop here, then your tax bill for *this year* is on $50 net capital gain ($50 realized gain from step 1, loss from step 2 disallowed). This feels like you are getting robbed because you only realized $45 in gain, but are paying on $50

HOWEVER, now STEP 4) The share you hold has a cost basis of $130, even though you only paid $125 for it. In other words, the share you hold already has your $5 loss built into the price. You then sell the share for $123. Instead of realizing $2 of loss, you realize $7 of loss. If you sell in the same year (and do not re-buy within 31 days), then your taxes are not affected. You show +$50, then 0 disallowed loss, then -$7 for total bill of $43.

If you sold in separate years, then you show +$50 in year 1, then -$7 in year 2. Net effect is the same, you are just paying more tax in year 1 and less in year 2.

The wash sale rule has lots of implications, but it's not a ""penalty."" You don't ever pay taxes on more than you make--tax rules simply won't allow for it.

The wash sale rule was designed to keep people from gaming the system by recording losses earlier than they realized them. For example if you took a loss on VOO today, but bought SPY on the same day, then the IRS just treats it as if you held the one position the entire time, instead of trying to record losses on VOO when your position in SPY is essentially the same and you really didn't book a loss.",PursuitOfThis,3,/r/stocks/comments/m7hxfi/wash_trading_confusion/grbief6/,0.092,0.85,0.057,-0.9508

There are 2 ways to pay estimates. First way: 100% of PY tax or 110% if you made more than $150k. You take the total tax, divide by 4, subtract your expected withholding (from say a W-2) earned ratably over the year. That is your estimate. Example: last year your tax bill was $100 and you had $95 of withholding. Your estimate = $100/4 - 95/4 = $1.25. Per quarter. You catch up anything you are short next April. No penalties. 

Second way: pay in 90% of current year tax each quarter as you go. So if you had a bunch of ST realized gains in Q1 you are looking at a big bill paying the tax on all those earnings. You do not get to take into account what you anticipate you may lose on the rest of the year. This can result in you being overpaid. So example: you make 100k in STCG and you are in the 25% tax bracket. Let‚Äôs ignore the graduated rates for simplicity sake. You owe 90% of 25k by April 15 this year. Take each quarter as it comes. You measure your quarters like this : April payment based on first 3 months. June payment based on first 5 months. September payment based on first 8 months. January payment based on whole year and don‚Äôt be short. 

Good luck. 

Back door way: call HR and hike your tax withholding on your paychecks sky high and hope you got enough in. Not recommended for the novice.
