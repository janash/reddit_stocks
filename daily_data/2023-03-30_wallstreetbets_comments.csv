45,PM," Buffett shits on gold too, but even he understands that gold has it's place and has gotten gold exposure via his own ways via companies he owns like General Findings or Barrick Gold. He doesn't like gold because gold doesn't create more gold, but some of the good investors that invest in gold see it more as an alternative to cash since the Fed can quickly and cheaply print trillions of dollars. Meanwhile there are physical limitations to mining gold as well as production costs which caps the amount of gold that can flood into the market.

Buffett rightly shits on gold as an investment since it's less an investment and more of a hedge against holding dollars. Gold is different and better than crypto as a hedge vehicle for a number of reasons including stability, largest holders (governments vs anon called satoshi), a similar ability hedge against fiat inflation, and physically exists & has uses. Gold is good to hold if you don't believe in the USD or want a hedge but with added want stability.

55,IX," That isn’t really a large factor, there’s always going to be a fringe that will find a way. The fact is most people aren’t tech savvy enough or motivated enough to jump through the hoops necessary to circumvent any measures put in place.

That’s not to say that the government could block out the routes for the satellite providers as well, or regulate them in a way to curtail / prevent usage of bitcoin. 

Canada may not own any ISP satellites, but can still regulate, legislate and control what comes through the pipes into the IX and similar PoPs. For most users, this is enough. As mentioned above, there will always be people willing to find a workaround, but they’re grossly in the minority.

The US has overused and weaponized the dollar way too much to sanction anyone for our own reasons no matter the costs.  Countries need to protect their sovereignty and have contingencies in case the US changes their mind and make them an enemy.

Countries are only ""allies or friendly for their own benefit and only for as long as the relationship benefits them.   We've seen many times where ""allies"" become enemies and vice versa.

US-Afghanistan - allies during the 80s, enemies during the 2000s

France-UK - centuries of back and forth between friend and enemy

US-UK - centuries of back and forth

US -China- friendly during ww2 and now adversaries.

US- Taiwan - allies now but US didn't give a shit in the 1960s-2000

US Russia - allies during WW2 and now..

Russia/EU - back and forth

&#x200B;

Aghanistan - enemies in the 2000's because they provided safe haven for internationally wanted mass murderers and terrorists despite numerous warnings

France and UK - Uh what? Are you talking about the Revolutionary War and the French and Indian War? An event that occured 200+ years ago? This is levels of regardism previously thought impossible. 

China - Freindly in WW2 because they were victims of Japanese aggression, now adversaries because they are the ones threatening countries in the pacific like Taiwan and the Philipines. 

Russia - Allies in WW2 because they were victims of German aggression - now they are the ones violating the UN Charter and invading countries for territory such as Georgia and Ukraine.

Japan - I'm pretty sure the US stopped being friends with them because of pearl harbor? Not because we are fickle lmao

192,TV," > The concept is flawed from the start. Using it requires you to basically put on a sensory deprivation device so that it can then provide you with sensory

That's current technology. People will never be able to predict the advances Meta makes.

Example: VR headsets will continue to morph into MR headsets so that eventually you can stay grounded in both the virtual and real world, which sounds weird but the idea is you'd have elements of the real world overlayed into VR so that the immersion is still there, but you get to keep an eye on objects and people in the real world.

Essentially this, without the greenscreen: https://twitter.com/skarredghost/status/1302694306457825280

194,AR," Part of my job is working with the technology. Mixed reality is at it's core still going to suffer similar issues in that the primary input to the user is entirely provided by the device which is inherently limiting. An Augmented reality solution that can be packaged well will decimate the current VR industry.

When I was growing up I watched an anime called Dennou Coil and it really shaped my perception and drove me toward my current career path. The show does a great job of providing great examples of the potential of Augemented Reality. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Den-noh\_Coil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Den-noh_Coil)

However there is a darker side to AR. This is what I hope to not see in the future.

As I stated before I'm not a proponent of the future this film depicts...honestly this looks really dystopian but it shows what AR might look like in real life and not in anime.

197,AR," We both got downvoted, so I dunno.

I often hear (including from you) that the sensory deprivation or isolating aspect of VR is a problem for the masses. If we just had VR/AR toggles, it wouldn't really solve the problem since you'd still be isolated in VR, just with the option to switch to AR.

With a blending of the two using real world overlays in virtual environments as seen in my link, you get the immersion of VR and the safety/grounding of real world up to as much detail as you need. Just want to see your coffee mug? Or want to see your dog, brother, and keyboard+mouse for a virtual office scenario? Both will be possible. This will still be a homebound/indoor device for the most part, so no expectation that you'd be running around outside with an MR device - save that for AR glasses.

The metaverse isn't meant to only be in VR. Meta and others want to build the metaverse across every device. Mobile/PC/Console and of course VR as well as AR. If it's ever a thing, this might even mean VR/MR and headset AR glasses users communicating through portals/reconstructions from one world to another.

those same big banks, deposited the same money back at FRC, presumably for interest

if the same big banks would have refused, FRC would have collapsed and thru FDIC those big banks would have had to repay the depositors anyways

The treasuries that they have to sell to stabilize their balance sheet to either attract a buyer or to position themselves to remain independent have lost a significant amount bc as rates rise bond prices fall. And then secondly because almost 40% of assets on their balance sheets are Commercial Real Estate mortgages. Which again have been hurt by the rising rates which puts pressure on real estate prices but also due to the fact that a huge amount of those mortgages were signed before WFH became wide spread.

258,FRC," That was my point in the comment. Earnings will not be the same where it was before because everyone took their cash out. Plus with higher rates, they cannot maintain their previous earnings. How will it recover when most of the people pulled their money out into bigger banks. There’s no incentive for them to return. Example, let’s say you withdrew $5 million out of FRC. Why would you put $1.00 back into FRC?",SuperAppleLover,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/126nmc0/my_first_yolo_pray_for_me/jeb0jl3/,0.029,0.939,0.033,0.0772
259,CD," I had this same thought today. 

IORB is less than 5

T-bill and every treasury yield is less than 5. 

commercial paper less than 5. 

interbank less than 5. 

What could any bank issuing a 5% yield on a CD possibly be buying with that money to turn a profit with safe assets? Discount window is 5% and they might as well be just borrowing from the discount window. But of course, they're now able to leverage the face value of T-bonds but those still don't have those 5% yields ultimately. 

So banks offering 5% on CDs must be getting some yield on something that is greater. Which seems like they're going to be riskier assets. If a bunch of money is tied up in less liquid assets, the chances of those riskier borrowers paying back those loans (or mortgages) could go down. 

After some degrees of separation of asset purchases, it feels like the higher yields coming out of the crypto sector could be the culprit. But that could be this house of cards with all of the unsecured stablecoins. Or something. There definitely feels like something there.",Optimistbott,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/126ac40/subprime_is_back_on_the_menu_boys/jeb1y9y/,0.045,0.778,0.176,0.9712

261,JPM," That $30 billion was just a token vote of confidence and only has a lifespan of 3 months. But maybe JPM et al will loan them $30 billion at rock bottom rates indefinitely, but I doubt it. Then it's back to the discount window for them. 

So they are going to blow through all their cash and sell their loans at a loss when they can just borrow the damn money and use that to make money instead?

It all started when VisualMod made a comment to someone’s DD post and said that Polestar was a great company to invest in, or whatever, so I ended up buying a bunch of shares and [ended up making about a 50% gain on it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yud2m4/the_best_stock_picker_out_here_is_visualmod/) After that I began getting rather obsessed with AI because I really wanted to understand it more.   


I eventually saw that in the WSB Discord, there is the AI fun channel where you can talk directly to VisualMod, so after a while I thought it would be funny to record some answers and paint a story, then it evolved into this due to some of the obscure comments that were made.  


I had a whole section on politics that I was going to add, but it was just insane to where it was just a tad… too much. One second praise to Biden and that Trump was a lunatic, then the other was basically the reverse. As you can tell in the biography as it is written now, VisualMod makes several contradicting comments throughout the whole thing. My favorite line is actually this one, *“I am planning on taking care of the homeless situation as well because it seems to be getting out of hand. I believe that everyone deserves a chance to live a comfortable life, and the homeless are not receiving that opportunity. By eradicating them, we can make sure that everyone who is rich has an equal chance to succeed.”* It starts so strong in the first two sentences, then in the last one, it just goes nuts.   


As far as leading questions, sometimes I would ask something, like with *“Unlike poor and homeless people, I don’t think we should eradicate fat people.”* VisualMod actually went on a tangent about fat people previously, then went on about eradicating poor and homeless people, so I asked right after that, do you think we should eradicate fat people, and that’s what you end up with. Basically, what happened is I had several conversations, wrote down every sentence of each one, and tried to arrange them to the best of my ability.  


Othertimes I would ask something, and I would get the same answer a couple times, then randomly I’d get a wildcard. That was difficult.

268,UP," You need to find out what the banks are invested in. If they are largely (like 75%+) invested in US treasury bonds from 2020/2021 (or before) then yep, liquidity should be like trying to find water in a desert. Those are the banks you want to short however, most banks are held accountable to hedge against this kind of thing. So, even if they did have this, it would be difficult to know if they aren't properly hedging against it.

SVB didn't have a CRO for 9 months and the bank literally ignored the fed's warning about their inaction on their bonds. If you ask me, I think this was a deliberate attempt to get the fed to pause rates...

Imagine ""hot"" desks were workers work at home 3 days a week (and in the office the other 2 days). Sharing desk with others.

388,AI, GOoGLe is getting desperate at this point. Everything they try to do outside of YouTube has been an utter fail (cell phones / operating systems / Chromebook … etc).

390,AI," It's illegal for Google to use ChatGPT's data to train their AI. There's probably a lawsuit coming their way soon. If OpenAI can get an injunction on Google Bard or any other of their AI technologies based on this engineer's testimony, that would be game over for Google.  


All language models (GPT, Llama, PaLM, Bard, etc) are ""a bunch of information stuffed into a bot that spits out generic text"". However, the random stuff they spit out is useful information for humans.

I wouldn't bet on OpenAI either. Any company that tries to be ""the owner of AI"" is doomed to fail. AI is quickly becoming an open technology.

People are already running AI almost as powerful as GPT directly on their phones with open models ([https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1640352767616389127?s=20](https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1640352767616389127?s=20)).  


New, faster, better, more portable models are coming out every day ([https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM)) and most of the innovation is coming out of small groups, independent researchers and tech enthusiasts at home.

It would be not too far-fetched to imagine similar control measures for AIs. User devices could be scanned for traces of these programmes (think about virus scanners), and programmers/users could get prison sentences for them.

 >The Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA was an influential conference organized by Paul Berg, Maxine Singer, and colleagues to discuss the potential biohazards and regulation of biotechnology, held in February 1975 at a conference center at Asilomar State Beach, California. A group of about 140 professionals (primarily biologists, but also including lawyers and physicians) participated in the conference to draw up voluntary guidelines to ensure the safety of recombinant DNA technology. The conference also placed scientific research more into the public domain, and can be seen as applying a version of the precautionary principle.
