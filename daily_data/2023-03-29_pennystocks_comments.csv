0,IP," The team just got back from Australia, and have been hinting about big things on their social media. $MDMA has the first mover advantage with all the regulatory hurdles out of the way ✅, IP on their medical grade product ✅, selling a product at a premium ✅, doesn't require ownership of a facility to manufacture it✅, securing more clients with year over year growth over 1000%✅.  
  
Combine that with the rest of the market in the dumps and a world where mental health is at its worst place collectively in history thanks to a ""pandemic"" & lockdowns.  
  
MDMA has a very high possibility of giving astronomical returns given the current circumstances and the anticipated ease on regulation in the not so distant future. Obviously this is just my opinion, but when you look at all the factors at play, I can only see a positive outcome. Use your own discretion, but I'm very bullish long term here.",mx3552,-12,/r/pennystocks/comments/125m2nd/pharmala_biotech_mdma_ceo_insider_buy/je4pm97/,0.027,0.859,0.113,0.899

22,IBIO," Rated a ""Strong Sell"" at CFRA as of 3/25: https://imgur.com/a/iPUDoTO


More reading:
>At one point, IBIO shares traded in triple-digit territory. Nowadays, circumstances cooled off significantly. At the time of writing, IBIO trades at just under $2. Unfortunately, circumstances suggest that it may have much more to fall.

>It’s not just about the terrible market loss, though it did hemorrhage 82% in the trailing year. Rather, the financials give little reason for confidence. For example, Ibio’s cash-to-debt ratio sits at 0.47 times. This stat ranks worse than 89% of its competitors. Also, its debt-to-equity ratio is 1.08, worse than 91% of sector peers.

>Operationally, Ibio’s three-year EBITDA growth rate comes in at 91.4% below parity. Also, its operating and net margins have completely fallen off the rails. Gurufocus calls IBIO a possible value trap, which may be an understatement. Lastly, covering analysts peg IBIO as a consensus hold. Their average price target pings at 50 cents, indicating over 74% downside risk. In other words, it’s probably one of the stocks to sell.
