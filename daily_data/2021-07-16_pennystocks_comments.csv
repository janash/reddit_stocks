0,ATOS," Copy pasting here one of my comments from yesterday:

“I am following my strategy, holding since 0.91$ and this is basically what I shared earlier:

As I have mentioned in the past I am here for the long run. My view is that only their breast cancer drug will bring ATOS to 5B market cap valuation and can be even up to 10B. I consider the 10B because as I own Gilead I know that they bought Trodelvy for 21B. I believe that there will be a partnership or BO in the near future because this is something that can have some “$$$ juice” for Big Pharma especially if this will replace Tamoxifen as standard of care for breast cancer.

Key for bigger valuations is if Endoxifen will be tested for other cancer types (this was one of the reasons that Gilead bought Trodelvy to use it as a platform) and of course if the Covid part will be successful.

So long story short is that I moved my initial sell order from 40$ to 80$ (FOMO considered). Phase 3 is something that needs to be considered (time frame perspective) but again prices of 30-40$ are totally achievable on a short time frame eg. partnership announcement.

This is a winner and we shouldn’t care about price fluctuations hence why I mentioned that OPEX is only a catalyst and not the end of the journey.

Enjoy the ride!”",AllSeeingEye7,12,/r/pennystocks/comments/olfsns/atos_opex_day_the_table_is_set_443744_oi_calls/h5ek2j4/,0.033,0.87,0.097,0.9484

83,ATOS," To all ATOSians just copy pasting here one of my comments from yesterday:

“I am following my strategy, holding since 0.91$ and this is basically what I shared earlier:

As I have mentioned in the past I am here for the long run. My view is that only their breast cancer drug will bring ATOS to 5B market cap valuation and can be even up to 10B. I consider the 10B because as I own Gilead I know that they bought Trodelvy for 21B. I believe that there will be a partnership or BO in the near future because this is something that can have some “$$$ juice” for Big Pharma especially if this will replace Tamoxifen as standard of care for breast cancer.

Key for bigger valuations is if Endoxifen will be tested for other cancer types (this was one of the reasons that Gilead bought Trodelvy to use it as a platform) and of course if the Covid part will be successful.

So long story short is that I moved my initial sell order from 40$ to 80$ (FOMO considered). Phase 3 is something that needs to be considered (time frame perspective) but again prices of 30-40$ are totally achievable on a short time frame eg. partnership announcement.

This is a winner and we shouldn’t care about price fluctuations hence why I mentioned that OPEX is only a catalyst and not the end of the journey.

Enjoy the ride!”",AllSeeingEye7,6,/r/pennystocks/comments/ol8jjz/the_loungedaily_plays_july_16_2021/h5ekxxl/,0.033,0.872,0.096,0.9484

138,YOU," If there’s one thing I learned earlier in the year, it’s that when you are already up big, sell when YOU want. Don’t let others bait talk make you overstay the welcome. ESPECIALLY don’t pass up huge gains for a promised catalyst in the future that everyone and their dog knows about. That’s greed blinding people’s judgment. 

TRCH was a good showcase of this. I trusted myself in locking profit before the deadline to have shares settle for the Ex Div date came but plenty of folks were starting to talk about a squeeze when the merger went through. A left a small fraction behind for curiosity’s sake but otherwise capitalized on the chance to sell shares for 4 times my cost basis. 

Fast forward 2 weeks and TRCH tanked before the merger, did a reverse 2 for 1 stock split, and then tanked even more. People online will never be satisfied and will always goad each other to keep holding and make the price rise infinitely. 

But big money doesn’t care for that crap. They will take the money when they feel good and if you don’t beat them to the punch you’ll get left holding the bag everytime.",OKJMaster44,4,/r/pennystocks/comments/ol8jjz/the_loungedaily_plays_july_16_2021/h5envd6/,0.039,0.82,0.141,0.9457

XELA is my next lesson. Took profits, decided to buy back in on a ""dip"" only to see that it rocketed a bit while at work only to crash.

Decibel has become dominant in concentrates (shatter and wax) as that market is under served, and they have a great brand that offers those products at surprisingly low prices- their flower is expensive but, with the highest THC on the market, it sells. They sell more concentrates than flower (gross sales in dollars) and are launching new products in that category. They have had more product on the market in the last quarter (which they should report next month) than the previous one due to their new production and concentrates being easy to bring to market (more so than flower, which takes time to cure).",Cordinklink,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/olhf1n/the_best_pot_stocks_are_pennies_update/h5efg4k/,0.014,0.914,0.072,0.7543
