8,DD," This will probably get downvoted and/or me banned, but I'd consider GameStop for the fundamentals alone. 
They have an incredible hand-picked team of prior Chewy and Amazon execs with Ryan Cohen pulling the strings, performing a massive pivot to e-commerce and teasing an upcoming NFT for being able to re-sale, lend, rent etc your digital gaming assets. (First in the market for that.)
Their long term debt is gone, and their cashflow is going strong, losses were less than expected, and offering same-day delivery utilizing their brick and mortar stores as distribution centers - its a total turn around in just the 1st quarter.
There is a TON of well written DD out there, AMAs with professionals, and a hella strong and supportive community which also lends to brand recognition and company loyalty. 
I've personally done nothing but profit from my investing with them, found support and ceasing of fears in the community, personally love gaming, and am excited to see what all they do in the near future for the market and the players. ðŸ™‚

12,DD," This. I used to try having a portfolio loaded with penny stocks and trying to time good entries for quick flips. But all that did was keep getting me boned by the shifting market sentiment and there's no way I could do this while actually doing enough research on the companies themselves to ensure I wasn't buying into a bubble about to burst. 

Right before small caps bounced back form the gutter, I decided to do a proper review of DD on 5 pennies I held and decided to cut off the 3 least appealing ones and consolidate into the 2 that I felt best about looking at catalysts and information. I also decided to drop all my swing penny plays that I knew dirt about. Now at this time, those 2 small caps (CTXR and TRCH) have ended up yielding some of the biggest returns in my portfolio this year so far (could have been even more if I bought consistently towards the bottom but eh) and have helped my overall portfolio break even and get into profit after being down since I started it in February. 

If you really want to hit the jackpot with pennies, your best bet is to find one for a company with actual fundamental promise that's still low and just let it ride. The market has normalized since the boom market of January. You can no longer just look at a random DD on Reddit, buy the stock, and then sell in 1-2 days before hopping to the next play anymore. Now you gotta do your own homework and find something with promise that hasn't made a big run yet that you feel willing to risk being apart. In others, gotta do some digging an have patience.

I hope the company makes a comeback, there's a market for what they were originally : a place to buy things to make other things work.

In the early 00's ceo Robert's turned the company into a high pressure cell phone and satellite television sales business and forgot completely about the core business... The 0.99$ resistors and the batteries that had a 98% margin.

In today's DIY/Maker culture RadioShack can once again live... Staff the stores with people who know what they're talking about and can help customers fix stuff rather than sell them a new phone.

27,RSI," Sorry to hear about the bad beat, hopefully you can turn it around soon!

For bio stocks, I like [this FDA calendar of biotech stock catalysts](https://www.biopharmcatalyst.com/calendars/fda-calendar). 

I also frequently scour the stock screener on [finviz](https://finviz.com/), sorting by price, avg volume, RSI - then research the companies that are overbought or oversold to see why they're in that position, if there's something coming up that could change current sentiment, then check the stock on a more full featured chart site like trading view or barchart to time an entry. 

I tend to go for options, so if you're just buying and selling, might have to adjust the strat. You could also just try to recoup losses with some r/thetagang strategies to farm premium.

I know you're asking for more specific companies, but I think a more macro view might help you find your own companies.

Catalyst 1 - Juneteenth  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth)

  
On June 19th, the USA celebrates which commemorates the end of slavery in Texas. Last year, due to the numerous tragedies against black lives in the United States, it was decided that on Juneteenth 2020 only black-owned businesses would be supported. This caused a historic multi-day gain in the stock prices of these black-owned businesses - more info here. This year, with the exponential increase of retail investors and the ""meme stock craze"", these stocks are expecting even crazier multi-day gains for Juneteenth 2021.

I still don't get Technical Analysis? it just looks like people are making shit up when they explain it. Personally, I like to look at company info news and technical analysis. But I guess TA must work if the big guys use it. Should I invest in the investopedia courses? Does anybody have experience with it?
