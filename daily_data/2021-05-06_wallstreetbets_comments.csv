95,RH," At best they’re clueless, in reality they know exactly what they’re doing and they’re complicit in screwing us all. They serve themselves, their lobbyists, and their campaigns. 

One side wants more regulation and/or fees that will actually hurt retail investors more. 

The other side wants to repeal anything that gets in the way of Wall Street fleecing everyone. They’ll eventually “give in” and make concessions once WallStreet tells them which regulations are best for WS. 

I think the best solution would be government minding their own business. “Regulation” allowed RH to screw everyone under the guise of “we’re just following the rules”. This shit doesn’t work when they’re the ones making the rules and they’ll always be the ones making the rules. Our politicians aren’t smart enough to make the rules, and anyone that is smart enough already works for WallStreet. New rules and regulation will only serve as another barrier to entry. There’s no way to “level the playing field” without over-regulating everything to a standstill. 

There’s also unlimited resources on the side of skirting the rules and pushing boundaries. The market moves at warp speed while government barely functions.

Sure, not all regulation is effective or well-intentioned, but if proportionately more people educated themselves about precisely what sort of regulation would help, and applied sustained pressure to the political system for financial reform we would be better off.

Should we, for example, do away with regulations against insider trading and reporting requirements for members of congress and corporate insiders to disclose their buys and sells?

237,GME," I agree with your first paragraph, but it seems that so many people believe that if the market is going to crash, they will be safe with GME because of it's negative beta.  That may have been true in the past, because GME rising was causing a selloff of stocks, because whoever was shorting wasn't hedged, but now knowing the consequences, they would have changed their positioning so they would be hedged now.   How many of those GME holders know the difference between a stock that has a negative beta at a certain point in time to those that think they will be able to use GME as a hedge against a stock market dip now?  


And I also agree that we can't be certain that the shorts haven't covered, but to me it seems very unlikely.  And I'm sure that's where we'll ultimately disagree.  If GME drops to the point where I consider it a value stock again, I'll buy back in.  But at this point, it's all guesswork.  I'd like to see GME make definite strides in profitability, acquisitions to make it more relevant, and ways to make use of their retail space (that branches out from games sales).  


I wish you the best of luck, and hope like hell it squeezes to your target price.  I sold when I saw the SEC start making noises about it the first time around, bought back in on the dip, and sold again when I thought it broke a technical support line.

259,AAPL," Fear of inflation is inducing a rotation out of growth. Tech (especially FAAAN/MG-ish stocks) are seeing  TREMENDOUS earnings reports and then either immediately staying flat or seeing a steep discount. AMD not only had a great quarter, but changed guidance from 37% growth for the year to 50% growth. The result? AMD is down 15% since the high on their earnings day. Same with MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, and even NVDA. PLTR is going with the market.  


Additionally, PLTR has no reason for price to increase right now, outside of the market/sector drop. They are significantly over-priced. I don't think the price is likely to drop down to a saner value. I think it's more likely to hold and stick around 20-30 *until the fundamentals  rise to justify the price*.  Everyone suspects they should have a pretty good quarter. That'll be good. They'll need several of those consecutively for the market to respond. Every few new big contracts and news stories, they gain another analyst adding them to their coverage. Enough really great quarters of growth (say, another year worth) and the market will start responding.  


Those of us invested now -- and those like Cathie Woods -- are playing the hunch and taking the risk that we are recognizing the potential of the company before the rest of the market has caught on to it. While they're waiting for results to move the price, we're betting on results. We could be wrong. Probably not, but we could be.  


Anyway, I have been calling this for weeks. Nobody -- not even the CEO -- has implied that PLTR is a short term profit play.

I think we'll see it trade flat after earnings or possibly very slightly higher for a day... and then all the ""HURR DURR PLTR 50 BY END OF YEAR"" people will get impatient (despite being warned since the beginning) and start selling off... leaving us back down to around  wherever we are just before the earnings report.

260,AMD," Fear of inflation is inducing a rotation out of growth. Tech (especially FAAAN/MG-ish stocks) are seeing  TREMENDOUS earnings reports and then either immediately staying flat or seeing a steep discount.

Same with MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, and even NVDA. PLTR is going with the market.  


Additionally, PLTR has no reason for price to increase right now, outside of the market/sector drop. They are significantly over-priced. I don't think the price is likely to drop down to a saner value. I think it's more likely to hold and stick around 20-30 *until the fundamentals  rise to justify the price*.  Everyone suspects they should have a pretty good quarter. That'll be good. They'll need several of those consecutively for the market to respond. Every few new big contracts and news stories, they gain another analyst adding them to their coverage. Enough really great quarters of growth (say, another year worth) and the market will start responding.

318,IBM," 
Okay so I'm not up to speed on plantir and never got into it because I just didn't see what was compelling about their offering. 

Here's my bear case (because you asked):

They develop integration software. So does IBM, Microsoft, Amazon and every 14 year old with a high-school education.

They are not vertically integrated like Amazon, Azure or IBM. Ie they cannot build services with the same effectiveness as their competitors and are thus at a disadvantage. 

They do not have first mover advantage, or if they did 10 years ago they lost it by now. 

They have limited advantages (if any) in a highly competitive feild and it's only getting more competitive as Integration and ML are more easily adoptable. (FOSS, higher level APIs, education, etc)

They have financial loses every year. (Like half a bill of loss year on year right?) and in 2 decades they havent figured out how to stop bleeding. 

Basically for me; I don't believe in their current direction, value in the market or ability to adjust/transform to technology changes.

Hope this helps,

320,PLTR," I don't really know much about data analytics. Business model sounds to me like they sell companies a roadmap so their customers *can* find their ass with both hands; on phrased another way, they take information the company ""knows"" through stored data, and then makes sure you actually *use* that data. Or something. All-told it sounds to me like they sell you software that trawls your spreadsheets and emails or some shit, feed data points to managers who will go on to make bad decisions based on it, and then charge you for the privilege. 

Someone way fucking smarter than me put up his reasoning though for why PLTR isn't a $30+ stock that plans to go to the moon. Short version of his reasoning: 

* They lean hard on government contracts, which all get priced in. 
* They have to lean on courts to extend those contracts. 
* Company insiders were *selling* their stakes, which is a bad, bad look

I'm convinced that once PLTR has more ground under them, they're going to (slowly) snowball and we'll wish we had a little longer with prices like this.  


PLTR has consistently tested and bounced off around 22, until the inflation-monster of the past week made everyone skittish, so I feel my call that it's not likely to drop under 20-ish was reasonable. The way people are reacting to tech and growth, though, it could prove out your expectations for awhile.  


Despite the limited market support for PLTR at the moment (while we wait for a few good earnings to grab their attention), it *does* have some massive supporters which I think would prevent that from happening. Cathie is scooping up a million  more shares *every time it dips at all*. Every time she does that, a slew of others follow suit and tons more retail investors double or triple down on their positions. So it seems very reluctant to go much lower than where it has been (sans this weeks' nuttiness).  


If earnings come out and are underwhelming, then all bets are off. I'll still hold, but it'll be through a storm of retail investors who largely don't seem to understand what  PLTR is facing right now (the ones who react to Karp exercising some options as if he's selling out the company and stabbing investors in the back because they don't seem to understand how stock options comp works).

535,RKT," The way things have been going I adopted a strategy called The Safest Bullshit Ever. It goes like this:

1. Wait for earnings reports
2. If it seems like a red day in general, and
3. The stock just dumped after earnings, then
4. Buy as many calls as you possibly can for like 3 months from now that are already ITM or very close to it
5. Set your sell limit at 15% and walk away

Saves a lot of time frothing and worrying about the stock market and staring at a screen, and minimizes risk. Rinse and repeat.

545,AMZN," From what I can tell this is essentially risking $100,000 to make $8,000? If AMZN had gone down those contracts would have lost value and then OP could either sell for a loss or they would have expired worthless at the end of the week resulting in a complete $100,000 loss. 

The risk/reward ratio is pretty skewed here so I have to wonder how many times this has gone wrong since in a case for something like this 1 loss can erase several wins.",Sharky-Li,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n68736/quick_8k_in_less_than_5_minutes_scalping_amzn/gx70h07/,0.182,0.696,0.123,-0.5719
546,AMZN," What I did was a pure gambling (that's why the name of this sub is wallstreetbets). I bought 10 call contracts of AMZN for $10.678 each around 9:33 am. At that time of my purchase, AMZN stock price was about $3250 and the strike price of the call contracts was $3300 that expires tomorrow. What that means is I speculated that by 4:00 pm tomorrow AMZN will be over $3300 and I paid $10.678 premium per share for that contract. Remember that each contract is my privilege to buy 100 shares of AMZN at 3300 per share. Now if AMZN closes at $3400 tomorrow then I can buy 1000 (10 contracts \* 100 shares) shares of AMZN for only $3300 per shares. Which means I will profit 100\*1000=100K minus the total premium of 10.67K (roughly 89.33K). 

Keep in mind that, most people do not have that kind of money to buy 1000 shares of AMZN and most don't buy these contracts with an intention to buy the underlying stocks.

Now, around 9:38 am, after 5 minutes of my purchase of these contracts, AMZN stock price moved up to about 3270. That's a increase in $20 per share which caused my contracts to increase their value to $18.69. Which means a $20 increase in underlying stock price increased the value of the contracts by $8. In order to understand why only $8 but not $20 you have to understand how these contracts work. Anyways, at that time I sold them at $18.69 per contracts resulting in a total of 18.69K (10 contracts \*$18.69 per share\*100 shares)(remember I paid 10.67\*) netting a total profit of $8K.

I could also make money by buying 1000 shares of AMZN at $3250 per share but that would need me to invest 3.25 million dollars! With that $20 per share price increase I could make 20K instead of 8K but duh! I do not have 3.25 million dollars. Even if I had I would not just buy that many AMZN shares just to make 20K (That's just 0.61% vs 80% that I made).

So far what I have wrote was all good but imagine AMZN went down by 20 in that 5 minutes. In that case I could lose around 70-80% in that 5 minutes! And that happened as many times as I made profit if not more. 

TlDr: I risked $10.6K for some AMZN options expiring tomorrow and got lucky with timing a.k.a gambling paid off. Do not even think about doing this kind of trade with this kind of capital unless you have a clear understanding of how options work. May be try buying a SPY call or put contracts with the same strike price as the SPY price and observe how the value of the contract move with the movement of SPY price.",Start155,209,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n68736/quick_8k_in_less_than_5_minutes_scalping_amzn/gx5purw/,0.014,0.854,0.132,0.9933
547,AMZN," AMZN closed today at $3306.37 and the $3300 call contract closed today at $20.20. Now the difference between the strike price of $3300 and the closing price of $3306.37 is only $6.37. Which means the contract only worth $6.37 because if you buy shares at 3300 when the share price is actually 3306.37, it make sense that you pay 6.37 extra as the premium because that's the actual difference between the true stock price and the strike price. This value is also known as intrinsic value of an option. Now, this scenario is true if the option expire today but he option is expiring tomorrow and no one in this world knows what will be the closing price of AMZN tomorrow. What if AMZN closes at 3400 tomorrow? Which means whoever is selling that option is taking a risk on a speculation that AMZN will lose lower than today. For taking that risk he is charging you an extra $20.2-6.37=$13.83. This extra value of the premium is called the extrinsic value of an option. Which means an option has it's true (intrinsic) value and an extrinsic (mostly premium for taking risk)

Options have five parameters known as Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega and Rho. The extrinsic value of any contract, be it a call or put, at a given time depends on these five Greeks. When a stock price changes over time, depending on how much change and how fast the change is, these parameters change and hence the option contract price. Every option contract has a expiry date and the most important parameter is the **theta** when the expiry date is close. This is basically how much the contract will lose vale in a single day inherently, if the stock price remain the same a whole day. For instance, the one I traded today expires tomorrow and has the theta value of -$15.53. Which means if AMZN remains at 3306.37 the whole day tomorrow and close at that price, that 3300 call option price will be $(20.20-15.53)=$4.67.

Now consider the person who paid $20.2 for the contract buying 100 shares of AMZN at 3300 per share. He will pay 330K for 100 shares. He already paid $20.2\*100=$2020 resulting in his net cost for owning 100 AMZN shares at $332020. Now consider the closing actual price of 100 shares at $3306.37\*100=$330637. A net loss of $1383 per contract. If he bought 10 contract like me then a net loss of $13830 and so on. What is the point?

The main point is there is no guaranty that AMZN will close above todays closing price tomorrow. What if AMZN closes $3270? The price of your option will be 0. AMZN need to close above $3320.2 (3300 for stock+ 20.2 for premium) just for you to break even. If it closes above $3320.2 only then you can make money. If the expiry date is few days ahead and I am at a small loss then I might wait to see if it recovers because that time theta would be relatively smaller than the one that expires tomorrow.

In the above example I simplified many things to make it easy to comprehend. I did not consider the inter-relationship between those Greeks while explaining the decay of option value. Hope it was helpful.

Edit: If it did not go my way I would wait few hours to see if it recovers only if the total loss was below 30%. But I would definitely not hold an option expiring tomorrow overnight.",Start155,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n68736/quick_8k_in_less_than_5_minutes_scalping_amzn/gx74jl1/,0.065,0.826,0.109,0.98

551,AMZN," That 33K was about 33% loss of a 100K trade with TSLA calls. It was not exactly FDs but TSLA was very volatile that time and stock price was very high (pre-split) and hence the contracts.

Same material that OSB is made of I-joist is partly made of in spans of like 50+ feet.  Just doesn't seem to add up. It takes on average 300+ sheets of OSB for a medium sized house (sheathing/roofing). Even subfloor that is a thicker product made in the same way.  So its a needed commodity.  Supply and demand if you catch my drift (i.e. jack that price up make to make more money cause people need it) But also shipping is a huge issue due to the lack of truckers on the road and fuel prices.

622,GME," Before all the ""look at his post history!"" replies - yes, this is my first post. I've been an anonymous lurker on reddit for the better part of a decade, finally made an account a few months ago so I could upvote / downvote things, but have never quite gotten the nerve to say anything, largely because of the ""look at his post history!"" replies and because I never felt I had something valuable enough to say or the time to write it up (that should change - if I take then I should give as well).

As many introverts are; I'm good with numbers. I've methodically slightly beaten the market for years - staying cautious and diversified, avoiding big losses but avoiding big wins as well. After taking a big chunk of that and putting it into my own company, I decided to finally make a big bet. I was highly intrigued by SKLZ when it first shot up to $30+. It had a great growth story and a huge market opportunity. It seemed high risk / high reward, but not purely speculation - it had big backing from Cathie Wood, Motley Fool, Morgan Stanley, etc. Still, I thought the price was too high and couldn't bring myself to jump in. And honestly I don't care for the company name. 

Also no, the games aren't great (yet). As a gamer myself, they're definitely not something I'd sit around at home playing in my spare time. But that's not the target market. Mobile gaming is largely about people (mostly non hardcore games - a bigger market) pulling out their phone as a short distraction at a bus stop, waiting in line for lunch, procrastinating at work, etc. These are things that are going to increase as the world opens back up. And things like Candy Crush and Words with Friends weren't huge because of their impressive graphics or complex gameplay - they were huge because they were addictive, competitive, and simple enough for anyone to play. 

After the initial surge in Skillz price came insider selling, a secondary offering, and short reports. To me the short reports had some valid points, but were grossly exaggerated and misunderstood the business. The insider selling - well, if I manage to take my company public at that valuation you sure as hell better believe I'm cashing in 10% of my hard work to get some financial security for my family and not be 99.99% all in on one thing. That was perfectly reasonable to me and company leadership is still heavily invested in the company. The secondary offering was very poorly timed, but did provide them with the cash necessary to put out big marketing campaigns and draw in new users. 

The price plummeted and seemed to stabilize at around $18. The price was right for me, and I went nearly all in on 100 December $15 calls (tried to post position, but comment wouldn't go through with the image). Then I watched in horror as the shorts relentlessly pushed it down to $13, then watched in relief as it shot back up to $21. Then the short attacks started again. Even after great ER (for an early stage high growth company) they continued. AH it dropped 8% before numbers even came out, then after release went to +5%, then the next day back down 9%. The price action has been completely absurd, clearly manipulated, and has caused me to pretty well lose hope in a system that allows this to happen to a promising company while CumRocket shoots up like 4000%. 

I'm not asking for any help with my bags. That's been another hesitation of mine in ever posting anything - the fear that I would cause someone to make a poor decision and lose big money. So please understand that this is still high risk, but both the short term and long term opportunities are there as the OP laid out so well. If they weren't, I'd unload my bags and at least put them somewhere else. But at this point it's also about more than the loss to me - I'm furious at a system that allows this to continuously happen and want to see it burnt to the ground piece by piece. 

And yes, I saw where CNBC mentioned it could be a WSB target while WSB was clearly focused on MVIS. But just because CNBC was wrong there, or is usually wrong, or is probably even oftentimes intentionally wrong, doesn't mean that anything they even mention is a bad company. This is a huge opportunity, and one that could absolutely squeeze hard. No, it's not the next GME and is unlikely to get squeezed to $100+ - the float is too high. But it could easily go 2X - 3X if there's enough volume to trigger it.",TN_wolf,10,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n5x8dn/opportunity_in_sklz_hear_me_out/gx50w1r/,0.118,0.704,0.177,0.9958

After taking a big chunk of that and putting it into my own company, I decided to finally make a big bet. I was highly intrigued by SKLZ when it first shot up to $30+. It had a great growth story and a huge market opportunity. It seemed high risk / high reward, but not purely speculation - it had big backing from Cathie Wood, Motley Fool, Morgan Stanley, etc. Still, I thought the price was too high and couldn't bring myself to jump in. And honestly I don't care for the company name. 

Also no, the games aren't great (yet). As a gamer myself, they're definitely not something I'd sit around at home playing in my spare time. But that's not the target market. Mobile gaming is largely about people (mostly non hardcore games - a bigger market) pulling out their phone as a short distraction at a bus stop, waiting in line for lunch, procrastinating at work, etc. These are things that are going to increase as the world opens back up. And things like Candy Crush and Words with Friends weren't huge because of their impressive graphics or complex gameplay - they were huge because they were addictive, competitive, and simple enough for anyone to play. 

After the initial surge in Skillz price came insider selling, a secondary offering, and short reports. To me the short reports had some valid points, but were grossly exaggerated and misunderstood the business. The insider selling - well, if I manage to take my company public at that valuation you sure as hell better believe I'm cashing in 10% of my hard work to get some financial security for my family and not be 99.99% all in on one thing. That was perfectly reasonable to me and company leadership is still heavily invested in the company. The secondary offering was very poorly timed, but did provide them with the cash necessary to put out big marketing campaigns and draw in new users. 

The price plummeted and seemed to stabilize at around $18. The price was right for me, and I went nearly all in on 100 December $15 calls (tried to post position, but comment wouldn't go through with the image). Then I watched in horror as the shorts relentlessly pushed it down to $13, then watched in relief as it shot back up to $21. Then the short attacks started again. Even after great ER (for an early stage high growth company) they continued. AH it dropped 8% before numbers even came out, then after release went to +5%, then the next day back down 9%. The price action has been completely absurd, clearly manipulated, and has caused me to pretty well lose hope in a system that allows this to happen to a promising company while CumRocket shoots up like 4000%. 

I'm not asking for any help with my bags. That's been another hesitation of mine in ever posting anything - the fear that I would cause someone to make a poor decision and lose big money. So please understand that this is still high risk, but both the short term and long term opportunities are there as the OP laid out so well. If they weren't, I'd unload my bags and at least put them somewhere else. But at this point it's also about more than the loss to me - I'm furious at a system that allows this to continuously happen and want to see it burnt to the ground piece by piece. 

And yes, I saw where CNBC mentioned it could be a WSB target while WSB was clearly focused on MVIS. But just because CNBC was wrong there, or is usually wrong, or is probably even oftentimes intentionally wrong, doesn't mean that anything they even mention is a bad company. This is a huge opportunity, and one that could absolutely squeeze hard. No, it's not the next GME and is unlikely to get squeezed to $100+ - the float is too high. But it could easily go 2X - 3X if there's enough volume to trigger it.",TN_wolf,10,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n5x8dn/opportunity_in_sklz_hear_me_out/gx50w1r/,0.118,0.704,0.177,0.9958

648,ASTS," Excellent post! 

Something else to consider is that the vast majority of ASTS shares are actually locked up until April 2022. I believe there's only 51 million shares currently available out of the total 181 million that will become available when management and the Pipe Investors shares unfreeze.and become tradeable. 

So while the company has a total market cap that exceeds 1 billion, only a portion of that total market cap is currently up for trade. 

This stock has all sorts of potential to rocket on good news and ultimately any lame bear arguments have an expiration date - when BlueWalker 3 (BW3) launches in late Q4 2021. BW3 validates the technology again because it is a small scale of the final product set to be deployed in 2022 with equtorial coverage ( accessing up to 1.6 billion clients).

The beautiful thing is the 50/50 profit sharing model with partners like Vodafone. Customer acquisition costs are covered entirely by Vodafone, but because they get 50% of the profit and Space Mobile will help them crush their competition and expand into new markets without terrestrial cell towers they will be heavily motivated to sell Space Mobile!

This thing is going to be a FCF machine! The initial phase 1 will cover 1.6B people around the equatorial region in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Global coverage will expand from there. This initial.group of 1.6B are craving for connection and many are completely un-connected because they are rural populations. While they are poor, the social, education, medical, safety, and economic opportunities they can access via mobile connectivity is a major incentive for them to want this ( remember they don't have internet in many of these places). So even if only 200 million of the 1.6B sign up and pay the $2 a months that's still 400M a month. The partner telecom gets 50% so they get $1 and we get $1. So 200M for them and $200M for us monthly or 1.2B annually for just phase 1! 

Let me break down how significant that is. ASTS will have very few costs to maintain their network once placed in space. They estimate for every dollar of revenue they will spend only 10 cents to earn it. That is astounding, but it makes sense when you recognize there is very little manpower needed to maintain space assets once in space. So that 1.2B of annual revenue will generate FCF of about 1.08B or $6 FCF per share. That's just from the equatorial region. More will come from the more economic prosperous areas where ASTS will change more. 

But $6 FCF per share is nothing to sneeze at, especially since the company will be completely debt free. ATT has something like 180B in debt and generates $3.82 FCF per share. What do you think a debt free company with a growing custer base ( the rest of the world) that generates $6 FCF per share would be worth per share? If ATT shares are $32, there's no reason to believe put shares wouldn't be 3x ($100 per share) that because of the $6 FCF per share with zero debt.

I think it's completely plausible that ASTS will be worth at least $100 per share by end of 2023 or sooner. If the company maintains a monopoly or at worst case a duolopy globally by 2024-2025 there shares will be trading easily in the $200-$400 range as revenue accelerates like crazy from the underconnected and disconnected parts of the world. 

But let's go back to the potential for a GME squeeze between now and the BW3 launch. With enough of us buying and holding it will cause the shorts to cover. When BW3 launches and is successful as all signs point to, the final serious bear argument is destroyed and significant interest will pour into ASTS....which will cause the shorts to cover even harder. If we start to dry up the supply of existing shares, like I said earlier there's not that many, we can GMe 2.0 this easily. 

Why do we want to GME 2.0? Well, destroying shorts is good, but it also serves a business purpose. The company says they will generate about $1.2B in 2023 and that will be used to fund phase 2, but if we spike the share price up on the backs of the shorts to $75-$100 this December, it would allow the company to dilute us by 15% and have 2x the cash needed for phases 2-3 or complete global coverage. They could expedite the roll out of the entire network and by 2024 or sooner have a global network up and running before any serious Competitors could establish themselves. 

Ensuring they are the monopoly will generate massive FCF! They already conservatively project $16B revenue by 2030 with global coverage. We could speed that number up to 2025 or 2026 and the stock would easily be worth something outlandish like $1000 because the FCF per share would be an amazing $51 per share! 

You can do the math yourself from their investor presentation and verify my math. The case I've presented here is real. A GME 2.0 opportunity exists between now and BW3. An opportunity to get even more rich also exists between BW3 and 2024-2027 timeframe. This is the most asymetrical trade of your life. The reward to risk ratio is heavily in your favor.

Seriously it is. 

So between now December 2021, there's room for plenty of catalysts (for example: new partnerships announced, progress with BW3, customer pre-orders through our exclusive partners of Rakuten, Vodafone, and ATT)  which will bump the stock up.

Let's GME 2.0 this between now and BW3 while the available shares for trade are limited. Let's make the shorts pay and position the company to expedite establishing a global monopoly FCF cash cow like you could only dream of. This is your and my ticket to exteme wealth!

If ATT shares are $32, there's no reason to believe put shares wouldn't be 3x ($100 per share) that because of the $6 FCF per share with zero debt.

I think it's completely plausible that ASTS will be worth at least $100 per share by end of 2023 or sooner. If the company maintains a monopoly or at worst case a duolopy globally by 2024-2025 there shares will be trading easily in the $200-$400 range as revenue accelerates like crazy from the underconnected and disconnected parts of the world. 

But let's go back to the potential for a GME squeeze between now and the BW3 launch. With enough of us buying and holding it will cause the shorts to cover. When BW3 launches and is successful as all signs point to, the final serious bear argument is destroyed and significant interest will pour into ASTS....which will cause the shorts to cover even harder. If we start to dry up the supply of existing shares, like I said earlier there's not that many, we can GMe 2.0 this easily. 

Why do we want to GME 2.0? Well, destroying shorts is good, but it also serves a business purpose. The company says they will generate about $1.2B in 2023 and that will be used to fund phase 2, but if we spike the share price up on the backs of the shorts to $75-$100 this December, it would allow the company to dilute us by 15% and have 2x the cash needed for phases 2-3 or complete global coverage. They could expedite the roll out of the entire network and by 2024 or sooner have a global network up and running before any serious Competitors could establish themselves. 

Ensuring they are the monopoly will generate massive FCF! They already conservatively project $16B revenue by 2030 with global coverage. We could speed that number up to 2025 or 2026 and the stock would easily be worth something outlandish like $1000 because the FCF per share would be an amazing $51 per share! 

You can do the math yourself from their investor presentation and verify my math. The case I've presented here is real. A GME 2.0 opportunity exists between now and BW3. An opportunity to get even more rich also exists between BW3 and 2024-2027 timeframe. This is the most asymetrical trade of your life. The reward to risk ratio is heavily in your favor.

Seriously it is. 

So between now December 2021, there's room for plenty of catalysts (for example: new partnerships announced, progress with BW3, customer pre-orders through our exclusive partners of Rakuten, Vodafone, and ATT)  which will bump the stock up.

Let's GME 2.0 this between now and BW3 while the available shares for trade are limited. Let's make the shorts pay and position the company to expedite establishing a global monopoly FCF cash cow like you could only dream of. This is your and my ticket to exteme wealth!

The float here is tiny and volatile.

The price has been artificially kept low on low volume. Huge amount of the float is locked up with 💎🙏 And same with the warrants.

To achieve 5g-speed coverage of the entire globe for lots of people, SpaceX's StarLink needs \~100x more satellites and the end user's antenna needs to be \~100x bigger. AND they use Ku- and Ka-band radios, whereas cell phones use (And by extension ASTS uses) much slower frequencies capping out in the C-band.

An objection from NASA is very rare.  And NASA's word carries significant weight with the FCC, which is the regulatory agency that decides whether or not AST Spacemobile will be allowed to deploy their constellation.

The problem NASA has with ASTS is that they want to deploy 263 extremely large satellites (each satellite has a 900-square meter phased array antenna to communicate with cell phones on the ground-- size of a baseball diamond).  Large number of extremely large satellites = increased collision risk in space.  If they can't work this out to NASA and FCC's satisfaction, they won't be allowed to deploy.

Long story short there's no real way to compare Starlink satellites to ASTS satellites apples-to-apples, since Starlink's user terminals are much bigger and can point their transmitting and ""listening,"" whereas cell phones (ASTS's terminal) can't.  Also, like I said, ASTS's satellites operate on lower-frequency (and thus lower-datarate) signals. IF you had to make Starlink compatible with cell-phones with those restrictions, any given ASTS sat is probably more capable than any given Starlink sat (That huge-ass solar panel/phased array antenna that ASTS flies isn't for nuthin').  But of course that's not the restriction space we're working with here; in the real world the constraints ASTS puts on itself by requiring itself to be compatible with cell phones means its service will be painfully slow if it's used by more than a tiny group of freakishly wealthy people.",Cornslammer,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6b5f9/asts_a_global_mobile_broadband_solution/gx78sse/,0.081,0.857,0.062,-0.7347

705,CLOV, Still holding CLOV but its a very speculative play. Those that are betting on age 60 medicare are wishful thinking. Biden may want it but it wont pass a filibuster. I am holding. Down nearly 50%. The company may do well in the future but the stock just goes down down down. I do believe the draw down is related to multiple things. 1. High value technology stocks continue taking a beating. 2. The stupid hindenburg report which is meaningless. 3. Chamath is appearing more and more to be very disingenuous. Those that slam Chelsea on the board are stupid.

And I’ll humor you and take interest rates out of the equation. Did you actually think housing prices would continue to rise to where less and less people can afford them and RKT grows mortgage volume needed to justify a stock increase? Did you not see Apple and Amazon’s quarters and countless other stocks who killed it but are capped bc of the current market and inflation worries. And you thought a mortgage stock currently in the best conditions possible was going to give great guidance and increase growth to justify growing a 40 bill market cap? What did you think interest rates were going lower? Did you think people were magically going to be able to keep buying houses at there absurd prices without any inflation that would drag down the market as a whole and RKT with it?,Tribebro,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n67egm/loss_porn_followup_from_my_rkt_post_yesterday/gx5reka/,0.063,0.766,0.171,0.9677
807,RKT," Wow mate you convinced me. You can times the stock price by the number of shares. Clearly I’m intellectually bested here. /s

You’ll take the interest rates out of the equation because you don’t have an answer for that. 

As to the rest of your “argument”, you’re so clearly misinformed. The housing market *was* hot at the beginning of 2020, shortly after COVID. Slashed rates meant everyone with a house was rushing to refinance, despite the economy tanking. It’s tapered off since. Let me ask you this: how do you expect people to be buying houses with unemployment at all time highs, entire industries shitting the bed. No one is affording a monthly housing payment without a job. With the economy opening back up the opposite happens, and will happen for RKT. I don’t expect it to balloon to a $80 billion market cap, but 50-60 B by the end of 2021 is entirely possible.

Anyway, I don’t have any intention of arguing with you on here. You’re free to do with your time and money what you want, just as I am with mine.

855,AMD," I've been bullish on AMD since I heard Jim Keller was helping design the Zen architecture.

Am still bullish but:

Intel CEO swapped and competition will be back in a few years. Intel is entering GPU market. As of right now, TSMC is having trouble keeping up with production due to drought + high demand without enough capacity to meet demands since TSMC is the most ahead semiconductor fab.

AMD products are flying off the shelves right now like other tech products but if competitors have competitive products at similar price levels andare in stock then people will flock to them.

In the enterprise space AMD is starting to take up market share and that will be amazing long-term. Their CPU architecture is solid and, being the first to use chiplet designs (which imo is the future) they will have a leg up against Nvidia and Intel who haven't really touched chiplets yet. Intel is currently brewing plans that will pay off in a couple years (heard they're hiring back some retired, genius designers for a 'fun project'). Nvidia is ahead of AMD in terms of GPU in terms of ray tracing and gaming performance but imo not by a insurmountable gap.

Mid and short-term, tech stocks are receding and (imo) markets looks like they about to crash or something.

I'm fairly new to actually investing but I've lurked around the investing scene for a while. You should double check my claims - I'm just a computer engineering undergrad who really likes games so naturally am a fan of hardware.

903,ASO," First one, Academy Sports. Most of you unwashed neckbeards probably haven't stepped foot in an Academy Sports store because it promotes doing things outdoors. You'd just waltz around feeling guilty for gaining another 40 pounds during Covid and purchase a DD sports bra for your ""girlfriend"" even though the cute cashier knows you reek of desperation, she can even smell it with her mask on. It's okay because your card is going to be declined and you'll shamefully walk out while the repulsed cashier attempts to scrub your Cheeto dust and dandruff from the nooks and crannies of the card reader.

Academy Sports is an American sporting goods store chain. We are all well aware of the effects that Covid had on retail during 2020 and know it's been a dumpster fire. Academy reported [earnings](https://investors.academy.com/news-releases/news-release-details/academy-sports-outdoors-announces-record-sales-and-earnings) on March 30th and somehow, these motherfuckers blew the roof off.

 • Fourth Quarter and Full Year Comparable Sales Increased 16.1%

 • Fourth Quarter Gross Margin Rate Expanded 420 basis points over Q4 2019

 • Full Year Net Income Increased 157.2% over 2019 to $308.8 million

How did they do it? I have no fucking clue. Their e-commerce sales increased by a cool and modest 60.7%. Where the fuck did this demand come from? Looks like you guys were sitting around in your moldy basements jerking off to some other retard's gain porn while too ashamed to post your loss porn, and Academy Sports was out there busting loads on faces and you just wait on your knees and take them to the forehead, eyes wide open. (Makes no sense, you sick fucks act like getting sperm in your eyes is something you can add to a resume since you ""watched a lot of kids"") Anyways, here's an [excerpt](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/03/30/academy-sports-and-outdoors-inc-aso-q4-2020-earnin/).

""While many of our categories benefited from the COVID-19 crisis, several of our key businesses such as licensed apparel, team sports equipment, apparel and footwear and back-to-school were adversely impacted and should return to normal this year. In addition to each of these businesses driving sales growth, they are all margin rate-accretive and should drive a return to a more traditional mix of sales. Fourth, we will improve our management of several seasonal categories where there are not worldwide inventory shortages, but where our initial inventory buy in 2020 was not enough to meet the strong demand. This year, we have modified our planning and allocation on products like grills and water sports to support additional sales compared to their normal trend line.

As we begin 2021, we are confident that we can continue to deliver strong results because of our incredible team, the continued development of our key initiatives, and the stronger, deeper relationships we have built with our customers. The company is providing the following estimate for fiscal 2021. Comparable sales are forecast to range from up 2% to down 2%. This is an 18% to 14% increase on a two year stacked basis.""

Okay great, so people bought a lot of workout equipment. Who cares? What you semen suckers fail to understand, is that some guys were able to find a woman that is attracted to them in a way that they will ACTUALLY have sex with them and sometimes that results in kids. Those kids have been at home all fucking year and their parents want them out of the house so they can boink on the kitchen table again. Ding ding, those rusty gears in your seemingly empty head are starting to grind. Yes wow, vaccines are starting to become mainstream and everybody is pent up at home with their crotch goblins. Enter every single recreational sport available. Beyond boosts in kids sports equipment that we will probably see (this part of my DD is literally just my personal social media feed where everybody on Facebook and Instagram is doing anything in their power to get the kids out of the house and bragging about it) we are obviously going into outdoor season. That means camping, vacations swimming and other things people with active and healthy lifestyles do. Academy Sports has it all. Tents, grills, coolers, clothing, swimsuits, fishing gear, canoes, sleeping bags. Do me a favor, walk into an Academy Sports store and look at the demand for yourself.

I obviously expect that Academy Sports will continue to exceed expectations and I am not the only one. Show me another stock with a [100% buy rating](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ASO/price-target/) and if you're too lazy, type in ASO on Robinhood and look for yourself. Now I'm going to get into the most interesting part. ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts. blew away earnings during a pandemic and has amazing financials and a healthy balance sheet. It's kind of weird that it is 9th on the [most shorted stock list](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest) when every other company on that list looks like it could use some adrenaline shots or life support. ASO was previously the most shorted stock on the market a few weeks ago. If I had a guess, it looks like shorters realized they shorted a company that didn't deserve to be, and they want to cover before wallstreetbets gets a sniff of it. Oops, it's too late now.

Dick's Sporting Goods is trading at a PE ratio of 14 and has a short interest of [16%](https://fintel.io/ss/us/dks). Academy Sports is sitting at an SI of 33.62% and a PE ratio of 8. Seems a little bit fishy to me and smells like a ripe vagina is wafting the room. What could these large funds know that we don't? Hmmm.. let's try nothing and the fact that they were hoping to capitalize on another seemingly Covid ravaged retailer. (Does this remind you of anything else?) I am not going to sell this to you as a short squeeze because those only happen when you have a very tight float on a company where buyers start jumping in droves while short sellers are already underwater in their positions. Also interesting because at the end of March it went from around $24.50 to around $32.00 and the price hasn't gone below $28.39. Also of note, the average 10 day trading volume for ASO is 1.584M. The entire float is [40,436,703](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest) shares with 33.62% of the float shorted, leaves you 13,594,583 shares short. That gives you 9 days to cover with average volume if they did nothing but buy and were the only ones doing so. Do what you will with that information or go do the math yourself. To me, it looks like some retards with a lot of capital put themselves in another bad situation. (Most recent rating from a JP Morgan analyst moves it from $32 to $35. If you're comparing companies in the same sector, who would you prefer to make your long AND short bets on? Operating income of Academy Sports at 129M in 2019, 222M in 2020 and 424M in 2021 with a smaller PE ratio, or Dick's with 445M in 2019, 409M in 2020, or 741M in 2021 and a PE ratio twice that of the former?

I already know you little ringholes get mad when you see a DD on a stock only after it's up 150% for the week, but this is one of those times when this post was made while the stock is down 3% for the week and up 10% for the month.

I do also want to give some credit to [/u/XionTG](https://www.reddit.com/u/XionTG/) for the predictions below that he made a month ago. They turned out to be spot on, even though he got a lot of flack in the comments.

I am not going to sell this to you as a short squeeze because those only happen when you have a very tight float on a company where buyers start jumping in droves while short sellers are already underwater in their positions. Also interesting because at the end of March it went from around $24.50 to around $32.00 and the price hasn't gone below $28.39. Also of note, the average 10 day trading volume for ASO is 1.584M. The entire float is [40,436,703](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest) shares with 33.62% of the float shorted, leaves you 13,594,583 shares short. That gives you 9 days to cover with average volume if they did nothing but buy and were the only ones doing so. Do what you will with that information or go do the math yourself. To me, it looks like some retards with a lot of capital put themselves in another bad situation. (Most recent rating from a JP Morgan analyst moves it from $32 to $35. If you're comparing companies in the same sector, who would you prefer to make your long AND short bets on? Operating income of Academy Sports at 129M in 2019, 222M in 2020 and 424M in 2021 with a smaller PE ratio, or Dick's with 445M in 2019, 409M in 2020, or 741M in 2021 and a PE ratio twice that of the former?

I already know you little ringholes get mad when you see a DD on a stock only after it's up 150% for the week, but this is one of those times when this post was made while the stock is down 3% for the week and up 10% for the month.

I do also want to give some credit to [/u/XionTG](https://www.reddit.com/u/XionTG/) for the predictions below that he made a month ago. They turned out to be spot on, even though he got a lot of flack in the comments.

""KATY, Texas, May 3, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. (""Academy"") (NASDAQ: [ASO](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/academy-sports--outdoors-announces-secondary-offering-of-common-stock-and-concurrent-share-repurchase-301282502.html#financial-modal)) today announced that certain of its stockholders (the ""Selling Stockholders""), including affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., intend to offer for sale in an underwritten secondary offering 14,000,000 shares of common stock of Academy pursuant to a registration statement filed by Academy with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""). The Selling Stockholders expect to grant the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 2,100,000 shares of Academy's common stock. No shares are being sold by Academy. The Selling Stockholders will receive all of the proceeds from this offering.

Academy announced that, subject to the completion of the offering, it intends to repurchase from the underwriters, out of the 14,000,000 shares of common stock, a number of shares having an aggregate purchase price of up to $100 million at a price per share equal to the price at which the underwriters will purchase the shares from the Selling Stockholders. The closing of the share repurchase is conditioned on, and expected to occur simultaneously with, the closing of the offering, subject to the satisfaction of other customary conditions. The offering is not conditioned upon the completion of the share repurchase.

Credit Suisse, J.P. Morgan, KKR Capital Markets LLC and BofA Securities are acting as joint bookrunning managers for the proposed offering.""",jbro12345,12,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n5tmpw/aso_gains_up_120k_at_close/gx3c29w/,0.04,0.841,0.118,0.9991
906,KKR," First one, Academy Sports. Most of you unwashed neckbeards probably haven't stepped foot in an Academy Sports store because it promotes doing things outdoors. You'd just waltz around feeling guilty for gaining another 40 pounds during Covid and purchase a DD sports bra for your ""girlfriend"" even though the cute cashier knows you reek of desperation, she can even smell it with her mask on. It's okay because your card is going to be declined and you'll shamefully walk out while the repulsed cashier attempts to scrub your Cheeto dust and dandruff from the nooks and crannies of the card reader.

Academy Sports is an American sporting goods store chain. We are all well aware of the effects that Covid had on retail during 2020 and know it's been a dumpster fire. Academy reported [earnings](https://investors.academy.com/news-releases/news-release-details/academy-sports-outdoors-announces-record-sales-and-earnings) on March 30th and somehow, these motherfuckers blew the roof off.

 • Fourth Quarter and Full Year Comparable Sales Increased 16.1%

 • Fourth Quarter Gross Margin Rate Expanded 420 basis points over Q4 2019

 • Full Year Net Income Increased 157.2% over 2019 to $308.8 million

How did they do it? I have no fucking clue. Their e-commerce sales increased by a cool and modest 60.7%. Where the fuck did this demand come from? Looks like you guys were sitting around in your moldy basements jerking off to some other retard's gain porn while too ashamed to post your loss porn, and Academy Sports was out there busting loads on faces and you just wait on your knees and take them to the forehead, eyes wide open. (Makes no sense, you sick fucks act like getting sperm in your eyes is something you can add to a resume since you ""watched a lot of kids"") Anyways, here's an [excerpt](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/03/30/academy-sports-and-outdoors-inc-aso-q4-2020-earnin/).

""While many of our categories benefited from the COVID-19 crisis, several of our key businesses such as licensed apparel, team sports equipment, apparel and footwear and back-to-school were adversely impacted and should return to normal this year. In addition to each of these businesses driving sales growth, they are all margin rate-accretive and should drive a return to a more traditional mix of sales. Fourth, we will improve our management of several seasonal categories where there are not worldwide inventory shortages, but where our initial inventory buy in 2020 was not enough to meet the strong demand. This year, we have modified our planning and allocation on products like grills and water sports to support additional sales compared to their normal trend line.

As we begin 2021, we are confident that we can continue to deliver strong results because of our incredible team, the continued development of our key initiatives, and the stronger, deeper relationships we have built with our customers. The company is providing the following estimate for fiscal 2021. Comparable sales are forecast to range from up 2% to down 2%. This is an 18% to 14% increase on a two year stacked basis.""

Okay great, so people bought a lot of workout equipment. Who cares? What you semen suckers fail to understand, is that some guys were able to find a woman that is attracted to them in a way that they will ACTUALLY have sex with them and sometimes that results in kids. Those kids have been at home all fucking year and their parents want them out of the house so they can boink on the kitchen table again. Ding ding, those rusty gears in your seemingly empty head are starting to grind. Yes wow, vaccines are starting to become mainstream and everybody is pent up at home with their crotch goblins. Enter every single recreational sport available. Beyond boosts in kids sports equipment that we will probably see (this part of my DD is literally just my personal social media feed where everybody on Facebook and Instagram is doing anything in their power to get the kids out of the house and bragging about it) we are obviously going into outdoor season. That means camping, vacations swimming and other things people with active and healthy lifestyles do. Academy Sports has it all. Tents, grills, coolers, clothing, swimsuits, fishing gear, canoes, sleeping bags. Do me a favor, walk into an Academy Sports store and look at the demand for yourself.

I obviously expect that Academy Sports will continue to exceed expectations and I am not the only one. Show me another stock with a [100% buy rating](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ASO/price-target/) and if you're too lazy, type in ASO on Robinhood and look for yourself. Now I'm going to get into the most interesting part. ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts. blew away earnings during a pandemic and has amazing financials and a healthy balance sheet. It's kind of weird that it is 9th on the [most shorted stock list](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest) when every other company on that list looks like it could use some adrenaline shots or life support. ASO was previously the most shorted stock on the market a few weeks ago. If I had a guess, it looks like shorters realized they shorted a company that didn't deserve to be, and they want to cover before wallstreetbets gets a sniff of it. Oops, it's too late now.

Dick's Sporting Goods is trading at a PE ratio of 14 and has a short interest of [16%](https://fintel.io/ss/us/dks). Academy Sports is sitting at an SI of 33.62% and a PE ratio of 8. Seems a little bit fishy to me and smells like a ripe vagina is wafting the room. What could these large funds know that we don't?

Hahah... I made money on MVIS 2x in the last 30.

Bought at $10 saw the peak at 26...but didn't accept that kill until it had dropped to $22.  Chart was clear sell at $24, but I weak handed the sale.  That's over 4-5days of trading. 

Got back in at $13 last week sold it at $16 2hrs later.  

I wouldn't own it at these prices for long, but you can use this volatility.  

MktCap of MVIS exceeds that MS pentagon contract...and they only sell a piece of that... MS won't buy them because they don't do hardware, and even if they did buy them it won't be for massive gains to the share price.  You might own this for future growth but it's not likely to explode, and not from these prices.   Fun play though.

Bought at $10 saw the peak at 26...but didn't accept that kill until it had dropped to $22.  Chart was clear sell at $24, but I weak handed the sale.  That's over 4-5days of trading. 

Got back in at $13 last week sold it at $16 2hrs later.  

I wouldn't own it at these prices for long, but you can use this volatility.  

MktCap of MVIS exceeds that MS pentagon contract...and they only sell a piece of that... MS won't buy them because they don't do hardware, and even if they did buy them it won't be for massive gains to the share price.  You might own this for future growth but it's not likely to explode, and not from these prices.   Fun play though.

922,IRS," I'm holding for now. The company has solid financials, and I think it's undervalued. Some people might see it as a great buying opportunity. Estimates are great and all, but if you look at Q1 2020 versus what was just released, those are some great figures. Really comes down to how you evaluate the numbers (Q1 2020 vs. Q1 2021, or do you look at Q4 vs. Q1 2020).

I'm in a weird spot as well, as this is all capital gains money that would be going to the IRS (I liquidated a lot of stock to buy a house when the market peaked, and I was unsure how much we would need), so I am either writing this off as a loss versus my capital gains or making more (clearly not right now).

All that 3d printer rage back in the day for GE and other large companies, and nothing really moved the needle.

Are you making money? Do you have new streams of revenue? Do you have cash on hand and reasonable debt? Netflix, Apple, and the other big boys got to where there are by innovating.

924,RKT," I was more on the train of the P/E of RKT is very low compared to RKT competitors, and RKT is doing quite well. I didn't expect it to rocket to the moon, but definitely not drop 14%+, especially for missing EPS by one penny. I know a lot of companies have hit or exceeded EPS and dropped, but this drop seems a little unfathomable (compared to Peloton, which makes a lot of sense returning and refunding all those treads, wasted RD / new RD required, brand tarnishment, and lawsuits on the way).

It seems quite undervalued with strong financials.

925,HUGE," Well they are already receiving royalties from an augmented reality headset that was sold to the US military through a contract with microsoft, called the HoloLens. Microvision has some of their tech inside that device so it’s not just hype.

Speculation, yes. Hype? That’s a little too strong of a word for speculation based on some serious technology that will make the future look like a sci-fi movie. Perhaps it is the right word but all for the right reasons. Shit is literally future tech that we have yet to perfect and utilize, but the implications for doing so are HUGE.

Until some bad news comes out about this company, there’s not really any reason to believe that 20+ dollars is way overpriced. Does it reflect their actual yearly earnings? No, but if we were to base their price on their potential future earnings if they stick to their plan and stay on track (as they have been), then this company is actually way undervalued. So that’s why we are seeing it battling back and forth between 10 and 20 dollars and now possibly 15-30ish dollars with the most recent market activity: investors are investing for different reasons. Some just want a quick buck so they buy low and then sell high and place put options when they sell and play it like it’s a game. Other investors see the potential for a high buyout at some point in the future and are just stockpiling shares for as cheap as they can get them and sitting on them for a year or more so that they can get bought out or just sell for long term gains for cheaper taxes whenever they want to a year from now, knowing there’s a good chance that it will be at an all time high compared to today just based on natural upward growth. Some see this stock as a dangerous investment that has to be timed perfectly on the ups and downs, some see it as a safe long term investment. And just like that, we have frequent violent upward and downward swings but doesn’t drop to a dollar like some people keep saying it will every time it consolidates from a huge run up.


Now might be the cheapest you can buy it at for the rest of your life. My guess is it will keep dropping and test the 12ish level of support. The stock will find a new bottom and chill there for a month or so and the slightest bit of good news could trigger another big run up (though maybe not as big as the last cause that was some bonkers shit). Any seriously bad news for this company will send it into the grave until actual revenue stream from big contracts rolls in which might take a long time so I’m hoping we continue to hear positive news about this companies progress.",OmNamahShivaya,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n68b95/gucci_tent_is_off_the_table_rkt_crash_landing/gx5q8af/,0.075,0.774,0.152,0.9911

928,MVIS," Ok but even Apple started off somewhere. It wasn’t always smartphones and even talks about manufacturing cars. I’m not looking to invest in apple. It would be nice to have a stock that i wouldn’t be worried too much about price movements, sure, but microvision has potential to go up a lot more than Apple will over the next couple years, percentage wise. If you told me today that MVIS would be up 100% by next year, I’d say yeah I believe it, but I’d also believe that it would be up 100% at some point before next year too. If you told me Apple would be worth 100% more next year I’d be like “ok pussy, make that call order then and show me your loss porn 1 year from now”.

You show me the next stock that will become the new Amazon of stock growth and I’ll invest into it. I’m not saying microvision is the next Amazon or the next Microsoft but I do think they will be in a good position to be bought out by a huge corporation like nvidia or Microsoft. And that means big $$$ 

Call it hype, call it a gamble, it doesn’t matter. Until we see bad news about the company or some actual bad price movements, I won’t dump this stock. Losing 100% gains in a day just feels bloody but it doesn’t hurt until you sell and we’ve seen many times now what happens when you sell on a dip with this stock out of fear of losing it all. You just end up giving out a huge discounted sale to the ones who see this as a good company.

I would love to hear your thoughts on why this company will fail in the long run because I need every reason to liquidate my entire portfolio on the next big run up so I can take a break from this stock madness incase the whole market collapses :O",OmNamahShivaya,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n68b95/gucci_tent_is_off_the_table_rkt_crash_landing/gx5xulr/,0.134,0.713,0.153,0.3183

937,ASO," I'm bullish as fuck on ASO, but you have your facts all fucked up.

First of all, ASO is extremely undervalued still.  That part is 100% true.

The short interest is not in the 30% range.  This figure is not up to date.  KKR has been selling off their ownership, in January, March, and another block just a few days ago.  They're considered share offerings, and while they're not dilutive, they are expanding the float. The only reason this WAS a crowded short was because KKR only sold brough like 25% of the shares to the market for the IPO.  I would guess that they own 55-60% now.  

Go look at their BBIO ownership, which was another portfolio company they brought public in 2020, and which they've slowly divested.  They don't intend to keep holding, and they have to slowly work out of it.  They'll keep selling when it spikes -- i.e. IF a short squeeze occurs, they'll take the tendies while you diamond hand your shit, and they'll kill the momentum.  Their job is to make money, not help you.

Beyond that, I guarantee you that shorts spent time covering after earnings basically confirmed the company is on the right track, and again today when big Five showed the industry is still on fire.  There's no money to be made shorting ASO, so unlike GME, there's not really a good reason for new shorts to replace old ones.

The short squeeze thesis is dead.

I'm not an expert on this by any means but smarter people have explained this part to me and I'm just trying to pass it along to you.

Their earnings call on Monday should knock it out of the park, but the entire earnings season for almost every stock has been so laissez-faire that I'm not hopeful for a reversal this quarter.

1085,DD," I see so much fear and anger in these threads these days. You know you can exit trades very easily these days and go into cash. Cash is king in a market like this, if you are completely hedged into the market then you're going to have a bad time until it recovers. Right now is the time to have cash waiting daily to make swing trades and take advantage of the cheap puts that are still out there.

Tesla puts for August/September are so incredibly cheap and the value has been increasing week to week since it has leveled off. When you see money going from calls to puts then you start to reverse the trend. This is a cult stock but it's not impervious to market corrections or even common sense. Trade with conviction, do your own DD but most importantly don't trade with emotions (you lose almost every time). You can always make money on the runup and the rundown, just need to know when to get rid of the pride and those 20-50% losses you accumulated on growth stocks the last 5 months.",tradeu1,10,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6g549/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_may_07_2021/gx76bdf/,0.069,0.847,0.083,0.1893
