119,AMC,"BB isn't being shorted. The GME action, and the AMC action, is a result of gamma squeezes and hyping for a short squeeze. 

BB is a completely different situation. I'm in no way implying that it's a bad stock or company, just that it's in no way like the GME situation. If you're buying BB it should be because you like the company and think that there is long term grown posltential, or to scalp it based on the hype. Just don't expect a short squeeze or for it to moon at the rate GME did without some earth shattering news.

Unless big money starts shorting BB big time it literally *can't* squeeze like GME, because there are no (very few) shorts to squeeze. Big money *might* actually do this, if they're really dumb, to try and correct the hype gains if they think it's over valued.

Then the algos shorted the stock and bombed out when the news hit catching all the stop losses along the way, tanking the stock back to a reasonable share price for what the company is and offers, and the gamblers who got greedy got caught and ended up bag holding.  
  
That was a stock that rose on news, but still was a pump and dump gamble play.  The company was never worth the share prices people were giving it, but they were doing so based on news of a new product.

Acquiring property and expanding his market reach and generating a lot of positive news. It's well known they are in the process of getting listed.  I'm really excited about the fact he bought the company behind their patented water purification system. The shrimp will make him rich, but the water system that can be applied to all land based aquafarming will make him a legend. 

It decreases the amount of water needed and gets rid of the Ammonia very efficiently. It allows for faster healthier growth at a reduced cost. Everyone will want to run that system and it sounds like he's making moves to get it up and running in several international markets. I followed $AQB pretty closely and their claim to fame is having the very first FDA approved GMO salmon approved for resale and consumption. The process took them near 20 years to be ready for market... the beauty with SHMP is they have similar increased growth in their Shrimp and potentially many fish, without the need for Genetic Modifications which means they can ramp up production very quickly and not have to worry about the GMO stigma that may hurt Aquabounty.

572,PCTI,"OK first, one of your links still has Ozop as a surgical company. That 8k is totally shit as Ozop hadn't been rebranded by then. And PCTI and Ozop didn't form a partner. Partnership involves bringing equal worth to the table. Ozop surgical was totally worthless when Brian came in, Chis of PCTI was looking to take PCTI public to fulfill her late husband's wishes and because Ozop was already public, for PCTI to become public as well, it had to be absorbed by Ozop the failing surgical company. So, no, not a partnership, PCTI, although more worthy and lucrative than Ozop, was absorbed by ozop due to its already public standing. PCTI would have had to create some shell company or do some other long standing crap just to go public and it would have been a bigger hassle than simply letting yourself be absorbed by an already public company. 2nd, to add onto my first point, that 8k they filed still listed as surgical can't really be used in the context of today. The plans of Ozop weren't known until after Brian's revamp. Which I'm very happy about. That revamp is what gives this current 8k lots of weight, way more than the previous one.

Some examples I found through this way are: PLUG, BLNK (when both are mid single digit), FCEL (when it is 2.2 or something), WKHS (when it is 15 or so), FSR (when it is 10.5), TTCF (when it is 17), AYRO (when it is 2-3), FREE (when it is 8). Obviously there are also some 'fail' like TRIT (when it is 11.1, got to 15 then back to 8 recently). 

Just want to stress that it is just an avenue to put the name out there so you can do some searches your own to see if it is actually a good stock and can possibly generate some hype (or potential value).",0.02,0.871,0.109,0.9432

“The company’s share count will be 337 million when that sale is completed, which is up from 58 million in October,” O’Rourke wrote in a commentary. “The company’s market capitalization is nearly double what it was prior to the coronavirus.”  Like the other names caught up in this speculative frenzy, AMC has had a high level of short interest as a percentage of the float, which stood at 23% on Friday. Monday’s share sales brings the short interest down to 11.5% of float, O’Rourke said.

771,DD,"(Disclaimer: This is just general advice/my opinion and is not a one size fits all approach)

I like to look at stocks/the market as forward thinking when and more a reflection of a company's future valuation.  Valuations are often based on future expectations (i.e. 6+ months out). So often times, people will purchase stocks based on rumors that could be about future revenue, growth, acquisitions, etc.

Once that news is official, the forward thinking catalyst is gone. So some people will unload positions at this point (or before).

For example, a lot of companies in the past 6-12 months have had predictions of great quarterly results leading up to their announcements on the Q(X) report. The stock will then rise leading up to the official Q(X) results -- Often times the official Q(X) results will even exceed expectations, only to have the stock price drop significantly after results are announced. This (IMO) is a good example of 'buy the rumor, sell the news'.

Edit: Just to add - You will often see people post DD after the 'good news' and hear people say it's 'already priced in' -- Again, this is a good example of the market being forward looking and having priced in these rumors/not being affected by official news (unless it's something very unexpected that's somehow been kept secret).",0.016,0.905,0.079,0.9349

For starters... 

Joey Gonzolez's restricted shares did not unlock until the 28th. 2 days from now. Why, if JG is the CEO of CLX Health would he tweet this on that account before he could get out of PASO himself? I'll note he also has several family members with restricted shares who are locked in until early February. It is certainly interesting that Joey Gonzolez's Twitter is also deleted. Odd timing considering, and especially odd when you factor in the connections he had on Twitter.

_______

Secondly... 

CLX Health is backed up by TransUnion (you know, the credit check company), UST Global, Sirius IQ, and a host of other ""big players"". Odd for this whole thing to be handled so poorly tbh. It also has several airline partnerships supposedly. You don't think these companies are now going to be subjected to absolute vitriol and hatred now? Harassed, and berated? Screamed at and threatened?  Why would they put themselves in such a position?

_______

And finally... 

Legally they would have been far better off doing an official PR if the deal was really off. Preferably before close of Q4. By doing it this way they are honestly opening themselves up to massive reporting to the SEC, SEC investigating, and potential lawsuits. Seems insanely odd to imply the deal is off in a tweet, especially timed in the way it is.
