0,AMC," That is actually really interesting. Are we seeing a shift in how public corporations engage with investors and more specifically retail investors ? Following the GME, AMC and BB   gains we saw this year, I think some executives are realizing the influence of retail investors on stocks.

AMC might be the first one, but other corporations might follow its steps and give more attention to retail investors. A good marketing strategy to target retail investors could be a game changer in the market.

Edit : following a lot of comments, I would like to make my point clear. I do not care about the free movie tickets or the popcorn. I am talking about how much attention the executives at AMC are giving to retail investors. The fact that the shareholders meeting will be hold on YouTube (if I understood correctly), they say they want a bigger presence on social medias to share information to their investors, etc. That is what I am saying could be a game changer in the market.

As far as why give out a free ticket and popcorn? Theaters make money from concessions. The free ticket is a loss leader and the popcorn is meant to make you thirsty. Likewise, making the retail/reddit investors happy = more free advertising on Reddit, because even people who aren't invested in AMC are going to see articles like this and think, ""cool!""

89,IRS," Absolutely nothing. It is your money. You can freely move cash between your bank accounts (those in your name). You don't have to report it anywhere or to anyone, not IRS, no agency whatsoever. (Even in millions or billions I assume, but then I don't have millions or billions). 

There is a maximum amount of money you can transfer on a single day from one account to another when you do the transfer electronically. Some have weekly limits too. This depends on your account level.  But you can still go over that limit if you call them on the phone and initiate the transfer through them. These limits matter - for example if you are paying for your kid's tuition, you are going to need a few days to complete the transfer and you don't want to do initiate the transfer at the last minute. 

One scenario where people with sudden capital gains run into sorta trouble is that they forget to pay the 'estimated tax' on the capital gains in the quarter when the gains are made. Such folks may end up paying a penalty when you file your taxes depending on the amount of taxes due. 

If you transfer money to someone else, it is a gift. A gift of $10K (perhaps 11K these days) per person per year is freely allowed with no gift tax (you don't even have to report it). Neither party owes taxes or reporting obligations. The limits are higher in some cases, like you are paying for your grandchild's tuition. 

You can transfer money to any of your accounts, even to a foreign bank account. If you do transfer to a foreign bank account and if the max balance is more than 10K, you will have to tell IRS the foreign bank account number and stuff in 1040 (form 8938).  If it goes over 50K or 75K, you have to report those account numbers to another agency called FinCEN in the Department of Treasury annually.

But I'm not sure what you mean when you say ""raise alarms."" Banks monitor EVERYTHING!! They have software systems that monitor every bank account they have. If a transaction seems suspicious, the banking system sends it to compliance for review. Most of the times it's nothing but they do look to see where the money came from. Brokerage accounts are good. A wire from overseas or another personal bank account ""needs further review."" Someone's account could be flagged by the bank and the account holder would never know. Anything that's over $9,999.01 goes under review. Some cases anything over $4999.01 goes for review IF there is no previous account history with those types of transactions. Unless you're up to no good, you have literally nothing to worry about. While the transaction is under review, it will show as pending in your account sometimes. Or.. the bank will let the transaction actually go through and STILL monitor it. The IRS wants their cut at the end of the year so do you need to worry? No. Is the bank looking at what you're doing?

160,AMC," Nah, it's extremely straight-forward.

GME started out as the mother of all short-squeezes, but it has turned into (mostly) a pump and dump.  The short interest on GME has fallen from over 100% just before the first peak to ~21% today.  The *vast majority* of shorts have closed out.  21% is still fairly high, so there's a little juice left to squeeze, but most of the price fluctuation at this point is due to apes pumping and dumping (most of them believing short interest is higher than it is).  

AMC is also ~21% right now which means most of the action on it is also pump.

For some perspective, 21% short interest is still enough to squeeze out a nice kick, but you're never going to get an infinity squeeze that pushes the price up huge multiples.  If GME skies over $400/sh it will be because of retail pump and the biggest losers won't be the hedge funds it will be the retail investors left holding the bag at the end.",SourerDiesel,-12,/r/stocks/comments/nqlc56/are_meme_stocks_just_one_huge_pump_and_dump/h0btaf4/,0.08,0.823,0.097,0.6428

164,GME," Memes and mother of all short squeezes aside, the future of GameStop is ridiculously bright. Ryan Cohen‚Äôs leadership, debt paid off early, online sales growth, retail locations being leveraged as individual service centers for same day deliveries, partnership with Microsoft and the sale of PC hardware at their locations, upgrading some of their stores to game lounges to fit the growing trend of ‚Äúretail as an experience‚Äù, and last but probably most important: investment in blockchain technology via NFT. They can use NFTs for digital trade-ins, digital goods, dividends, as a stock alternate, as a cryptocurrency, or for a myriad of other use cases. I know I‚Äôll get downvoted here, but remember when people used to crap on Amazon who was JUST an online book store‚Ä¶.

If you are one of the many of us who thought ‚Äúoh if I had only bought Apple/Amazon/Tesla when it was cheap‚Äù then this is your sign. GameStop had no right surviving COVID and the shorts piling on to drive it to bankruptcy, but thanks to deep value investors, new life has been breathed into the company. Even if it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúsqueeze to the moon‚Äù (which I personally believe it will) the long term value of GME is insane based off the gaming industry alone.

203,GME," I respectfully disagree with your opinion, and wish you luck in your investments. I‚Äôm not trying to convince anyone to buy GME, just simply defending my position. I think you underestimate the potential of having a small network of retail locations that can serve as same day fulfillment centers, and double as a store front (think UPS Stores). 

I also think you underestimate the transition to experience-based retail. The prevalence and success of e-commerce is a byproduct of stagnation in traditional B&M locations. Why go out and get the product from a store, when I can have it shipped to my house for free? This mode of thinking shifts when the store offers an experience that you cannot get online. As someone who worked in the theme park industry, I can tell you that we intricately themed our stores and provided live entertainment and story lines in order to sell an experience. Sure we could just shove a ton of wands in a store with four walls and call it a day, but the story telling experience and immersion is what makes guests pay $50+ for a piece of molded resin. I think GameStop creating lounges allows them to pick strategic locations that will cater to that ‚Äúexperience‚Äù, while still retaining its traditional stores as guerilla fulfillment centers for its push in e-commerce. They want you to buy online, but they also want you to come into their new locations and join tournaments, socialize, rent out party spaces, pay per hour game, etc. it‚Äôs simply diversification of revenue streams.

204,UPS," I respectfully disagree with your opinion, and wish you luck in your investments. I‚Äôm not trying to convince anyone to buy GME, just simply defending my position. I think you underestimate the potential of having a small network of retail locations that can serve as same day fulfillment centers, and double as a store front (think UPS Stores). 

I also think you underestimate the transition to experience-based retail. The prevalence and success of e-commerce is a byproduct of stagnation in traditional B&M locations. Why go out and get the product from a store, when I can have it shipped to my house for free? This mode of thinking shifts when the store offers an experience that you cannot get online. As someone who worked in the theme park industry, I can tell you that we intricately themed our stores and provided live entertainment and story lines in order to sell an experience. Sure we could just shove a ton of wands in a store with four walls and call it a day, but the story telling experience and immersion is what makes guests pay $50+ for a piece of molded resin. I think GameStop creating lounges allows them to pick strategic locations that will cater to that ‚Äúexperience‚Äù, while still retaining its traditional stores as guerilla fulfillment centers for its push in e-commerce. They want you to buy online, but they also want you to come into their new locations and join tournaments, socialize, rent out party spaces, pay per hour game, etc. it‚Äôs simply diversification of revenue streams. I see it as them having their cake and eating it too.

It's called overvoting. Apparently it happens in 50-100% all shareholder votes? There's a big lawyer who specializes in these, he did an interview on superstonk. 

And yes, overvoting can be used to sue hedgies who caused it, and by sueing you can dig up more documents, and prove other stuff like illegal naked shorting etc. 

This is what is expected in GME shareholder meeting in 7 days and why the ""apes"" are yelling at everyone to vote with their shares.

If the vote amount is reasonably aligned it doesn't exactly ""do"" anything.

216,SI," The synthetic shares is just one part of the equation. The officially reported short interest is still extremely high (the VW squeeze which x5 its price occured with 12% SI, and there wasn't even so much FOMO and options activity around that stock), as for the shorts reported in that link I added, it's even bigger. Hence, the short squeeze thesis would not be affected. However, I'm most certain that there is a crap ton of synthetic shares, which is a cherry on top. You are right, you get voting rights, as it doesnt matter if you bought a share from a naked short seller or someone genuinely owning the stock, and so this share recount, which will take place starting today and will probably take a few weeks at least will give us a better picture of HOW many synthetic shares there really are.

217,GME," It is legal because it is assuming the market will correct itself eventually (which it did with the short squeeze which bankrupted at least one hedge fund in Melvin Capital).  At any point person A or B could have refused to loan out their shares.  Person A or B could recall their shares.  This is just the market at work.  Contrary to what you may hear on other sites short sellers can never actually bankrupt a company.  The worst thing that happens to a company being shorted is that it is harder for them to raise additional capital by issuing more shares.  If the company is actually successful and profitable they could start buying back their own shares at a huge discount which would also put pressure on the short sellers as that would decrease the float and increase the price which would increase the chances of a short squeeze.  They could also issue a dividend which the short seller would have to pay out to the people they borrowed the shares from increasing the cost of holding the short position.

What we saw in GME is an aberration where too many shorts piled into a company that they thought had not future,  Others noticed the precarious position that put them in and a squeeze occurred.  As far as I can see the meme stocks are now worth more than they would have been without all of the shorting and the ensuing squeeze.  The only problem now is that people are greedy and want it to go higher and are insisting it would be higher if only there wasn't this imaginary corruption and illegal activity.  The problem is that many people who don't know better are believing them and thinking that the game is rigged and corrupt which is a dangerous mindset when there has been no actual evidence of illegal behavior. 

One of the most famous quotes about the market is ""the markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent"".  That cuts both ways.  The markets were irrational for a long time when the shorts were making money and now they are irrational by staying so high after the squeeze.  Eventually meme stocks will go back to trading on fundamentals but when that happens is anyone's guess.  I personally am not betting on or against them just watching the show and trying to help people who don't know any better for falling for misinformation.

So that shouldn‚Äôt be the main reason for anyone to pick dividend vs non dividend stock. The rest of reasons as to why people should prefer an index is valid.

‚ÄúThe economy, as measured by gross domestic product, can be expected to grow at an annual rate of about 3 percent over the long term, and inflation of 2 percent would push nominal GDP growth to 5 percent, Buffett said. Stocks will probably rise at about that rate and dividend payments will boost total returns to 6 percent to 7 percent, he said.‚Äù",acegreen1989,2,/r/stocks/comments/nqbweg/help_setting_a_portfolio_goal_to_get_to_a_point/h0ahlgv/,0.024,0.935,0.041,0.296

Short term (1-3 months) is going to be volatile AF, especially as pipe investors release their shares (total of 850 million shares, 200m available for trading right now with the rest in lockup until various metrics are met). SoFi appears to be a very solid company, the DD I have done shows strong user growth, low debt, good growth, will be profitable this year with over 1B in revenue. They are also pursuing a bank charter and have acquired a California bank to help with that, should the bank charter get approved the stock could easily jump above $30 by the end of the year. PT's are all over the map, realistically WITH the bank charter this year I see the company sitting in the $30-40 range as long as the market stays healthy overall. If there's good earnings reports and continued growth I could even see it as high as $50 with the charter.

Many companies really have not been harmed by this.

I named several individual companies that have had record years or at least very profitable years. And I can also confirm for you as someone who works in furniture sales that furniture is literally through the roof right now and the company I worked for just closed out a record year. We were not harmed at all by COVID(Although we braced for it and expected layoffs), and in fact our comp plans were greatly improved due to increased performance.

Morover you simply need to look at the housing market to confirm mortgage companies having a great time, houses are selling way over ask and demand far outstrips supply. 

Many companies really have not been harmed by this. Certain *sectors* have yes, including travel, entertainment, the hospitality industry and so on have been negatively impacted, this is true and is probably a contributing factor to lower GDP growth but you are dead wrong if you want to argue every company ever is struggling right now.

Many are booming, including retail sales(TY TP shortages), gaming companies, ecom companies like Amazon, streaming services, furniture sales, and the housing market and mortgage companies with that.",Nafemp,1,/r/stocks/comments/nqplrb/the_pretense_of_knowledge_my_bear_thesis/h0d4j9a/,0.122,0.72,0.158,0.7984
474,GDP," >Your problem is arguing total GDP growth and not looking at individual sectors. You're taking a blanket approach to a topic that is truly MUCH more complex than that. Moreover avg GDP growth has ALWAYS been more lax than total market growth. Average GDP growth from 1980-2018 was 1.67% per year. The S&P 500? Avged about 7-10% per year.

What's complex about it?  GDP is a blanket indicator, S+P 500 is a blanket indicator.  If your argument is that tech might swing valuations up higher, then the tech-light DJIA went up about 27% in that same period.

7-10% a year with 1-2% GDP growth has nothing to do with 25%+ a year with *negative* GDP growth.   That's not a fair comparison at all.

>I named several individual companies that have had record years or at least very profitable years. And I can also confirm for you as someone who works in furniture sales that furniture is literally through the roof right now and the company I worked for just closed out a record year.

That's great!  Of course some businesses made it out okay.  That doesn't mean the economy did.  If you don't like GDP, look at [unemployment](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/unemployment-rate).  Unemployment jumped from about 3% to about 15%.  Would you really argue that the economy as a whole was more productive during this time?

>Morover you simply need to look at the housing market to confirm mortgage companies having a great time, houses are selling way over ask and demand far outstrips supply.

You're proving my point.  You can't have a sustainable recovery based on demand only. You need supply.  Negative GDP growth and skyrocketing unemployment shows that supply (production) is down.  The reason for such high demand is because the Fed is printing money and making borrowing cheap.  It's a phony recovery.

Not every company ever is booming, no, but the economy was deeply wounded by this.  That's why such aggressive monetary and fiscal policies were pursued in the first place.",shortyafter,1,/r/stocks/comments/nqplrb/the_pretense_of_knowledge_my_bear_thesis/h0d5l25/,0.073,0.858,0.069,0.4671

The GDP is an indicator of the ENTIRE economy.

The S&P 500 is just 500 US companies. The two aren't really equivalent and shouldn't mirror each other--and they don't.

>Unemployment jumped from about 3% to about 15%.

And rapidly dropped down to 6.1% today.... and is projected to keep decreasing. Come on man you're cherry picking half the data here... We both damn well know that unemployment was very volatile last year.

Moreover the unemployment rate today is not really comparable to other unemployment rates of the past. There is [no employment shortage](https://www.epi.org/blog/u-s-labor-shortage-unlikely-heres-why/) in fact there's an *employee* shortage thanks to stimulus plans not really incentivizing people to find work. There certainly is jobs there for people when those stimulus plans open back up and a lot of jobs are even increasing wage offerings to get people to come apply.

I feel like you're looking at raw data and coming to conclusions without actually looking at the world around you for actual causation factors. We live in unprecedented times to be sure and the circumstances of today aren't really driven by the same factors as '08, so taking an even analysis between the two and predicting a crash just because of what happened then isn't entirely accurate.

Could we have a crash in a year? Sure. But I don't see anything signalling that and we could just as easily see another 5 years of growth.

>has nothing to do with 25%+ a year with negative GDP growth. That's not a fair comparison at all.

Which as others already noted we already had a flash crash for in the first 2 quarters when the GDP was the worst off.

GDP actually RAPIDLY: SOURCE:(Hyperlink doesn't like this link) https://www.bea.gov/news/2021/gross-domestic-product-4th-quarter-and-year-2020-advance-estimate#:~:text=Real%20gross%20domestic%20product%20(GDP,real%20GDP%20increased%2033.4%20percent. began rebounding in Q3 and Q4 thus being reflected by the fast recovery in many sectors.

Moreover, as you said yourself we are overall net green now. Which really kills your thesis. Why should we have a crash to reflect a crashed GDP that is in the rear view mirror now???

This would be like arguing we would have another crash in 2010 because 2008 and 9 had negative GDP growth years...",Nafemp,1,/r/stocks/comments/nqplrb/the_pretense_of_knowledge_my_bear_thesis/h0d6lf4/,0.123,0.808,0.069,-0.979

Right now I‚Äôm up ~50% in a month. The volatility is ridiculous. But I also just couldn‚Äôt really stomach a stable position fluctuating this much. 

However it did show me the real money is in playing the volatility. What an amazing opportunity to sell calls on and collect premiums. Wait for the next dip, buy back in and repeat.

So going forward I don‚Äôt ever expect the huge $mm moons, but I also no longer expect the totally massive drops either- at least not for a while. I think volatility is where the action is and both retail and whales are playing the volatility and capitalizing on the market sentiment.

So as others have said, be smart, make your money or shoot your shot. But don‚Äôt get greedy and know that sentiment can and does shift. And don‚Äôt expect a bunch of strangers to hold a line, the huge sell offs prove that everyone has their sell price.

559,AMC," First of all, don't listen to any of the cult morons that will come your way. They are literally in the same position you are in, clueless, newbie 'investors' who got in at the sight of free, quick money. The only difference between you and them is that they are on the 'good' side. For now.

You really need to speak to your broker about getting options. It's crucial. That way you would be able to hedge with calls on the deepest OTM call you can find. That way you would sleep well knowing your losses are limited and there is barely no chance of a margin call.

AMC is not worth 40$, 30$ or even 10$. These meme stocks will rot back to where they came from. It's a matter of when, and you need to be prepared to hedge and actively manage your position in order to end up with a profit.

Having said that, you shouldn't have been playing with things you don't know about. And with these amounts of money. Also, don't come to Reddit for investing advice. It's rampant with baffoons that think because they are spewing big words that they know what the fuck they're talking about. They are not. They are riding waves too big for them to ride, just like you are trying to do. They think they'll get off the wave just in time... And they don't. They never do. It's human nature.

564,FACT," I had an epic short battle; when the repo market got going berserk in late 2019, I started shorting the S&P.   I took losses, took losses, and took more losses.    But I was sure that there was a fundamental problem.  Then March 2020 hit.  I made a ton.   But it wasn‚Äôt because of the reasons I thought the market was overvalued.  So, as it rose, I bought 3x inverted S&P index funds.   I lost more than what I made by Christmas of 2020.   I now know, for a FACT, that this market is liquidity-driven.  There‚Äôs no way in hell, with inflation predictions and fake interest rates, that the stock market is worth what it‚Äôs worth.  BUT, I quit shorting it.   Why?  Because of Keynes‚Äô famous quote saying: ‚ÄúThe market can stay irrational longer than you can stay liquid.‚Äù   Absolute truth.  You always pay a price for shorting.  It‚Äôs a tremendous disadvantage.  I‚Äôll probably never do it again.",bluejeff1976,3,/r/stocks/comments/nq7611/any_advice_for_minimizing_losses_as_this_point_on/h09q9h0/,0.204,0.712,0.084,-0.9638

568,SI," I'll be straight with you. And if anyone who probably doesn't even have a position in the stock let alone a clue what's actually happening wants to redicule me I don't really care. 

There's every chance of this hitting triple figures by the end of this week. Obviously I don't have a crystal ball and can't guarantee that but it's a very strong possibility. 

And most of us long are in this to destroy shorters. And the stocks SI is only going up at the moment so they haven't even begun to cover. So we won't be going anywhere either for the foreseeable future. 

And the next time people want to take advantage of a global problem to try and destroy a company and put thousands of people out of jobs just to make money for themselves we will be right there to stop them. 

Consider that before shorting a ""meme"" stock in future.

569,AMC," For what it's worth I feel your pain, I closed out my short earlier today knowing I likely won't be able to borrow the shares again. My retroactive advice, which definitely doesn't help you now, is to buy some cheap calls to put a finite limit on your losses on a short position. You can still do it now, but any calls worth  buying are extremely expensive right now.

If you have the margin available to keep the short open without blowing up your account, good luck. It just wasn't worth it for me when it looked like this was going to be another green week because I had to keep a ton of uninvested cash in my account due to the ridiculous margin requirements being enforced for an uncovered short position on AMC.

570,AMC," dude, i will say this as nicely as i can while making sure to get the point across. You shouldn't be day trading.

I've been in your shoes very early on when i started trading. If you are letting quick price action turn you around multiple times in the span of a few days, then you've already lost.

IV is way too high now to even dream about hedging with calls without locking in some substantial losses.

Personally, i don't think this rally is sustainable, but the real question is ""can you stomach seeing AMC at $70 without closing""? And can you do that without getting margin called? if you can, go ahead. if not it is time to close.

And truthfully, it sounds like you're now just trying to fomo to make that money back. #1 rule of market psychology. When you realize your losses, that money is gone. you are making new money after that. Dont revenge trade bad positions just to get that lost money back.

if you are closing, eat the loss and move on, unless you can truthfully tell yourself something materially changed to make you now bullish on something you were bearish on 1 week ago.",username--_--,1,/r/stocks/comments/nq7611/any_advice_for_minimizing_losses_as_this_point_on/h0bxy92/,0.059,0.827,0.115,0.9062

It looks like Visa is seeing alot of volume ... Personally, I tend to bet on reversals and not momentum, so I would be biased that this chart is going to pullback before it continues climbing, but the RSI would indicate it shouldn't sell off too much if it does ... if it sold to 221 and failed, I would expect it to fall to 205 and if it broke that then 190 and then 185 looks like it was tested alot ... but I really doubt that would happen tbh. This is a very strong chart and its growth is steady over years. No recent parabolic gap up or anything. Id say be prepared to potentially see $210, but honeslty im bullish on $V.

Not much I can say on $PSY it appears to have only been trading for a few days? Extremely low volume, however. Not much context to work with here unfortunetly.

618,TGT," I tend to purchase stocks/companies that I think their product is the best, or can be the best, or has some market edge. Nothing earth shattering  or cutting edge- but things like TGT, AAPL, DIS, LOW make up a large portion of my portfolios.

I don‚Äôt like buying something because I feel like it‚Äôs ‚Äúundervalued‚Äù. I‚Äôm not smart enough to know what an appropriate value for multi-billion dollar companies is. There‚Äôs professionals who think AAPL is appropriately valued at $90 a share, and others who think $180 is a more appropriate valuation. It‚Äôs their full time job to analyze these things and come to their price targets. Why would I have any better understanding of what‚Äôs a fair value and what isn‚Äôt? The 20 minutes a day I watch CNBC or read some articles makes up a tiny fraction of the work professionals do.

645,IMO," It really depends how you intend to trade. Let's say you're putting 3k into every trade and you're exiting when you're up $100. How often is that happening? A few times a week? How often does one of your picks have to go down $500+ before you're losing money? What happens when all of your capital is tied up in stocks going sideways bc you entered 10 trades w 3k each and they all down? Are you just going to sit on your hands until that cash is recovered, and just no longer trade until then?  

I'm not saying any of this will happen, and I hope it doesn't! Just situations you should be prepared for, worst case.  Unrealized losses are fine until you don't have any more cash to make money with, IMO.  My real point is you should have a plan for anything that could happen.

Personally, what I would do would be to buy enough shares so when it goes up (x%) I can sell some shares to lock in profit, and then i also still have some so if the stock continues to climb I'm still in it, and if it doesnt, my risk is reduced.

Tax wise anything less than a year is seen the same. Anything you held over a year is taxed separately. 
You can use losses to offset gains
But still more profitable to pay tax on winning trades
