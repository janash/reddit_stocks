3,EU," Lost in this is the fact that reserve status really isn't that big of a benefit to the United States financially. It would, at most, result in a small rise in interest rates.

It would substantially affect the bite of US levied sanctions though. So countries like Iran, where the US has sanctions but the EU does not would be much better off.

Edit: Adding a couple of columns from Krugman that goes into depth on this.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/03/opinion/us-dollar-reserve-currency.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/03/opinion/us-dollar-reserve-currency.html)

>It’s true that the dollar’s special role probably lets America borrow a bit more cheaply than it could otherwise, and we in effect get a zero-interest loan from the large quantity of U.S. paper currency — mainly $100 bills — held outside the country, much of it for nefarious purposes. But these advantages are ultimately trivial for what is, after all, a $26 trillion economy. So, no, the dollar’s dominance isn’t under threat. And even if it were, it wouldn’t be a big deal.

>This willingness of foreigners to hold American cash means, in effect, that the world has lent the U.S. a substantial amount of money — maybe on the order of $1 trillion — at zero interest. That’s not a big deal when interest rates are as low as they are now, but in the past it has been worth more — **maybe as much as 0.25 percent of G.D.P**. America does, then, get some advantage from the special role of the dollar. But it’s hardly a major pillar of U.S. power. And being the world’s primary supplier of assets used in illegal activity isn’t exactly a role filled with glory. So is it possible that the dollar will eventually lose its dominance? Yes.

5,UK," Yes, We have heard this out whole lives. It’s not like tomorrow dollar is going to get replaced with something else.

Nothing is going to replace the dollar as the reserve currency. 

What is increasingly happening is that countries are signing up bilateral trade agreements in their own currency. India, China, Saudi, and other major countries are doing it. This will reduce the need of dollar reserves among countries. 

The dollar will exist as the favourite global currency, but most countries will also do significant bilateral trade with their own currencies. Technology can now easily enable it.


Also here is another thing that people don’t want to admit: US’s sanctions and ability to cut off Russia from international markets, freeze its $300 billion USD assets spooked many countries especially in Asia. If US can do that to a country as large as Russia, they could do it to anyone. Countries did not care as much when it was happening to Iran etc but now it has spooked many countries.

Nobody wants to give US that kind of leverage against them in the future. So they are all setting up trade deals to trade in their own currencies. This will only increase. China has $2Trillion in USD reserves. You think china looked at how Russia’s $300 billion got frozen overnight and think they are fine? They could lose their $2T reserves with a sign of a pen by the US president if shit hits the fan. China is the largest trading partner to 70% of the countries in the world. They are now pushing countries to accept the yuan. 

India has moved all its oil purchases and trade with Russia to the rupee. They are doing this with UAE, Iraq and Saudi. India is the 3rd largest energy importer in the world. They are now signing free trade agreements with UK, Australia and want to use local currencies for trade

The other major event is US tightening interest rates. US raised interest rates faster like never before and this has nuked many economies worldwide. Dollar suddenly became very strong and countries are struggling to maintain balance of payments, shore up dollar reserves. Look at Sri Lanka, Pakistan etc their economies are devastated and imports have stopped because of dollar’s strength. Smaller countries are now realising how much they are beholden to US Fed’s decisions. This kind of dependency is now very apparent, as interest rates are being hiked by the fed, after a decade of super low interest rates. It’s not a good thing to be so dependent on a foreign country’s fed decisions. 


People who says Chinese yuan will replace the dollar or some other currency will replace the dollar are all wrong too. Nothing will replace the dollar, what will happen is more trade in a collection of non dollar currencies, especially between large trading  countries",not_creative1,60,/r/investing/comments/126n5a0/just_something_to_keep_in_mind_as_im_seeing_a_lot/jeaja5g/,0.074,0.795,0.132,0.9812

10,UK," The underlying question is ""why is the US dollar currently preferred"" and is this going to change?

It's not just about trade, or the supposed ""petrodollar"".   OPEC can sell petroleum in any currency they want and it wouldn't make much of a difference.

The real reason is the investment world.  People with money are willing to invest in US Dollar based loans and investments because they're pretty confident they will get their money back.  US regulatory system is decent at protecting assets, and most foreigners (excluding Russia, Iran, Cuba, and North Korea) will be able to get their assets out.

That is definitely not the case for any other currencies except euro, UK pound, and Swiss franc.  Only euro has a large enough economy size and investment opportunities to make it comparable to the US dollar, and it is now a second 'reserve currency' for similar reasons as the US dollar.

China has a large enough economy, but there is no security that foreigners can get their money out except according to the whims of the CPC. 

Back to the origin:  why does Saudi Arabia price petroleum in dollars?  Because when they get their money they like to invest in US dollar-based assets because they're better than alternatives.

In a nutshell, the bond market drives reserve currency status, which is why it isn't bitcoin either as there's no bond market in bitcoin.",DrXaos,17,/r/investing/comments/126n5a0/just_something_to_keep_in_mind_as_im_seeing_a_lot/jea7vtv/,0.023,0.877,0.1,0.9288
11,USA," Basically with USD you can buy anything from the USA and the USA economy still produces a lot of important stuff

So if you are some smaller country and exporting something ; taking USD is still a safe bet in exchange.

With USD you can buy almost anything that the USA produces and the USA still produces lots of needed stuff like ag commodities (grains , cattle ) , energy (oil , natural gas) , vehicles , military equipment, software, medicine , chemicals, farm machinery or just machinery in general ....

If you are trading with Russia and take the ruble well you can buy oil/gas and not much more.

If you are trading with China and take the Yuan well you can buy lots of manufactured goods but not oil/gas/ag commodities as they do not export a lot of that stuff

That and just momentum . After WW2 the USD sort of became the world reserve currency as most other developed nations were in disaster so that how it got its status. Now everyone trades in USD. Getting everyone to switch currencies would be hard.

Even if BRICS enter some trade deal to trade in YUAN well they can, but then they will have to trade the YAUN for USD to trade outside the group

Just for efficiency it lends it self well to have only a couple currencies used for trade, there are approx 180 different currencies in the world, meaning if you wanted to exchange all of them for each other that is 32,400 different combinations.

If you wanted to change the Nepal Rupee for the Burundi Franc I am not sure you can directly , you probably need to exchange to USD or EURO then exchange those for the other currency as there is just not a lot of people who probably can use both .",SirGlass,5,/r/investing/comments/126n5a0/just_something_to_keep_in_mind_as_im_seeing_a_lot/jea6ll5/,0.031,0.904,0.065,0.655
12,USA," From the perspective of geopolitics, I think it's just a lot of the countries who aren't US-friendly throwing tantrums that they can't just do what they want and get away with it. Mostly, they just don't want to be affected by US sanctions and control, which I suppose I can at least understand on a surface level. That being said, most of that ""control"" is stuff like what we're seeing with Russia wanting to avoid sanctions for their awful war.

The problem is that if they don't want to play by the rules, they will have to pay the costs to be their own reserve currency, which none of them can afford or support in any scalable manner. So it ends up self-defeating at the end of the day.

The irony, is that a lot of these countries (looking at you China) have probably benefited massively from ***not*** being the reserve currency and allowing USA to bear the costs to uphold this system. But they're myopic and only see that they don't have ***control*** over this, so therefor it's a sovereign threat to them despite the benefits it has provided over the decades.

To summarize, they want to have their cake and eat it too, and are throwing tantrums that they can't do that.",cbus20122,6,/r/investing/comments/126n5a0/just_something_to_keep_in_mind_as_im_seeing_a_lot/je9xvrs/,0.092,0.851,0.057,-0.8259

Expanding their balance sheet is not de-facto easing. There is a lot more nuance and complexity to this than ""balance sheet up vs balance sheet down"". 

>What happened with QT?

Literally nothing. They are still doing QT.

>so what happened to fighting inflation? 

Literally nothing, they still increased interest rates last meeting if you didn't notice, and inflation HAS been easing (although still well below their goal).

It means they are going to use the tools they have available to best deal with the problems at hand. 

The fed exists to promote financial stability, price stability, and full employment. Sometimes these goals are at odds with each other, which is why it's a difficult job and you often get conflicting policy choices.

Unsurprisingly, we compare ourselves to others that are close to us rather than actually seeing how fortunate we are on a national scale. At my age, my parents were fortunate enough to afford putting me in a  private high school for the last 3 years of my education, and it has really skewed my perception on what is reasonable/attainable

All my friends grew up with 30k+ sport cars at 16 and have never worked a day in their lives while I got my car at 18 and had to pay for it myself. This is not to say my parents aren't financially able, and I am most definitely sure they are putting me through this so that I can learn the true value of money. It's funny as this is coming from a place of insane privilege, as so many people wish they had the ability to outright purchase a car at 18, and being at a CC has shown me just how fortunate i truly am

This is compared to tax bracket during career earnings and across many years. On a per year basis if you have years where you make very little, it may make more sense to do Roth. If it's to the point of being under the standard deduction, there is literally nothing to gain by doing traditional and you will be taking worse distribution terms.

45,PHD," First of all, thank you for having a space where people can ask questions.  
I’m a prospect student for a masters in Economics in Germany. My bachelor is in Industrial Engineering from Panama, I work currently as a Data Analyst. But I’m looking into the future to change a bit career paths into a more economical side. I’ve been reading a lot about the subject, specially the difference between studying a masters in Finance vs Economics, and although both offer a lot of job opportunities, I’ve came across that in order to make good money on Economics you should have a PHD. So, I would probably need to do a masters 2-3 years, plus a PHD 5-6 years (With very poor salary, if any).   
To be honest, I like academy but to spend so much time in that studying, is not what I had in mind, also, according to many surveys, most professions related to teaching are the ones making salaries above 80 or 150k. I like to teach, but to spend so much time, I don’t think is what I was looking for. And by getting only a masters in Economics, will that be sufficient to get a good earning job? I would look to salaries beyond 70,000$ a year in either Germany or other countries. So, would it be better for me to just do a masters degree in Finance? Will that take less time in studying and more time working to get better salary? Or can I, via a masters in Economics build a career path that can take me to greater professional growth and income earnings?   
Important facts:  
\* I prefer economics because it involves a greater picture of the economical and financial world, that would give me many opportunities in both industries, I think, but your thoughts? Does everyone agree?  
\* I like research, analysis, working with people, decision making, finding out new things, I’m very curious.  
\* I don’t like repetitive jobs, such as accounting, that’s why I’m more inclined towards economics. But if it will necessarily mean so many years of study, I don’t like that. I was doing some research on economist positions, and many required phd, so that’s why I got scared.   
\* I also want to gain good money to invest in business, stocks, and real state. But also have good quality of life with family. So that with better financial freedom, I can do another job such as teaching (Now, I know in this last scenario a PHD would be the best idea for teaching, but I don’t want to spend my 30s studying all the time…) I would probably be another type of teacher or I would build a consulting business.

51,IRS," Thanks for your thorough reply.  

It is true that I did not divulge any info about my background or my situation, which is beyond anything you described.  Yes, I have used / am using Fidelity for the comparison.  In fact, that is what helped me lean toward MOAT,  I already have an investment in SPY.  I was wondering if I should buy some more SPY or maybe buy some MOAT.  Undecided as to if I would keep the SPY I already have.  I am diversified; I own more than a handful of stocks, ETFs, fixed income stuff, etc.  Yes, all dividends are re-invested.  But neither MOAT nor SPY are dividend-rich to begin with.

As far as the long-term, I was using the IRS definition:  ""To correctly arrive at your net capital gain or loss, capital gains and losses are classified as long-term or short-term. Generally, if you hold the asset for more than one year before you dispose of it, your capital gain or loss is long-term. If you hold it one year or less, your capital gain or loss is short-term.""  But, I would probably keep it much longer than a year.

Bottom line:  It appears to me that the total return on MOAT, compared to the total return on SPY, more than offsets the larger expense ratio of MOAT.  And yes, MOAT has fewer holdings (\~50 vs \~500 for SPY) and in that regard is much less diversified and subject to more risk.

The realized loss isn't lost. It's just deferred to new tax lot which is why the cost basis is $109 instead of $101.94.

It's fully deductible when the new tax lot is sold because the loss is accounted for in the cost basis.
