Do I think that GME still has a chance to short squeeze? Highly doubt it now unless people are still interested enough by the time of the hearing, but HF knows that they just need to gaslight and separate the more conservative holders or those that actually went full retard and dropped their life savings from the group mentality. They have way too much to lose to not do it. 

Was it stupid to buy into GME? No, not at all, the fact that it got to 400$ shows that it definitely was possible if halting buys didn’t kill the momentum.

Is it stupid to still think a short squeeze is possible? Also no, but betting on it is like trying to win the mega million. Don’t get a second mortgage on your house for lotto tickets. Do however average down that 400$ powerball into something more manageable. Buy the dips then try to flip some money. I’m thinking HF are laying on the MM yesterday but I’m not going to deny at the same time people are definitely paperhanding it. It’s a combination that’s to be expected.

I still think GME could pop, but I’m not willing to bet my life on it. I have about 4K in GME but this was all money I made earlier when it jumped to 400, so I’m not worried about losing this money. Now I’m at that point where I’m averaging down and trying to get somewhere around the ballpark of where I think the company will be on the actual market. If it does pop off great, but this is what risk management is about. Go play damage control and try to get to a point where you feel more comfortable, then HOLD. 

I would like to mention that 10 years ago GME was worth around $50 and that was without international recognition. My guess as to where it’s going to be in the next few years would be 60-100$.

I know they hired on some ecommerce execs but what is it expected that they'll actually *do*?

The only thing I can think of is that they morph into a pop culture outlet that serves gaming culture without any actual games. Like selling Funko Pops, trading cards, apparel, graphic novels, gaming-centric Lego special editions, etc. All that stuff will be very appropriate to catching the eye of walk-by customers at malls/strip malls where their stores are.

But I just don't see any path at all for them to succeed in any variation of their previous business model. Sure, there will be a market for used game resale for a few more years, but it'll steadily decline as everything goes pure digital over time. Morphing into Goodwill is not a long term strategy.

As you might conclude from my questions, I'm not a sophisticated investor. I did buy AMC a few months ago because I figured they would whether the pandemic, but I sold once I saw I had a solid return (*very* far from the high it hit, but oh well).

97,GME," So I'm speaking as someone who was always interested in getting into the stock market, but was too intimidated to try. That was until this whole GME thing served as my catalyst to jump in. I bought in on Monday the 25th at ~$96/share for 5 shares. Every day since then I've spent some time every day trying to educate myself on the way the market ACTUALLY works during normal times. I wouldn't go so far as to claim to know what I'm doing, but I'm trying real hard to apply some critical thinking here and not get sucked up into hype. I only spent what I could afford and while I'm certainly not happy about the prospect of losing money in all honesty if this stock drops all the way to $0 it would have no impact on my life whatsoever. Would have been nice if I had gotten out at the peak so I could afford that new wood lathe I've been eyeballing, but that's the way the cookie crumbles, right?

My admittedly uneducated opinion is that this whole thing was absolutely about to blow up on Thursday. I think it could have went upwards of $700/share if not $1k. But I also think in the days leading up to that there were some closed door meetings where a number was decided on where it would be cheaper to pay any lawsuits, SEC fines, and even risk jail time than it would have been to have to pay hundreds of billions out to all of us peasants. I think we hit that number and they pulled the trigger on their plan and killed off every bit of momentum we would ever have. 

The short squeeze isn't going to happen at this point, at least not as big as everyone is fantasizing about. If they were able to kill it once there's no reason to believe they wouldn't be able to do it again. Personally I'm close enough to turning a profit that I'm still holding, but I'm not about to 💎🙌 this bitch all the way to $0. I think it'll get to $100 again, might even get to $150, but that'll be the best we can hope for. I feel bad for everyone who bought in at the peak, and even worse for people who spent money they couldn't afford to spend. It's a hard fact that lives are going to be ruined over this.

Edit: Jesus people, stop taking this so seriously. I would have thought it would be obvious that I have no evidence or knowledgeable basis for any of the statements made in this post. People keep asking ""what in your research led you to this number"" like I put more than 2 seconds of thought into it. Any numbers were pulled straight out of my hemorrhoidal ass. This whole idea of a secret meeting is just straight up tin foil hat conspiracy made up right off the dome. If you caught on to the fact that this is all 100% opinion before reading this edit, good job, you're not a total idiot.

&#x200B;

I used to work by their corporate office in Grapevine Texas.  They had a major distribution center that we would meet at and tour to share ideas and train our employees.  It started as a way for our two companies to stop stealing employees from each other.  My end take away was this company was already out of B&M stores and game consoles.  They were expanding operations in Germany and investing into new business models to sustain their brand outside of physical disks.  

Most of us saw this when they started buying and trading other tech in their stores.  But that was quickly killed by other retailers.  Their WMS investments and focuses on actual technology does give them hope in the future, but their game stores are what everyone thinksof.  Those are dead even though the lights are still on.

The smart advice for a big win is usually to stop the degenerate gambling. Close out positions. Do NOT touch the account, literally walk away from it before you lose it. Let your mind and emotions settle. Figure out how to divest from stocks (real estate, etf, etc)

Those that don't head the advice yolo their wins on their next play while they are riding high on a lucky prediction and invincible ego. They end up with a blown out account anyways even if they were up a couple hundred grand or a million. 

If you come here and every single DD looks like gold on a platter, you might as well take all that money in straight cash and put it on a table. Take a good hard look at it and hug it goodbye. Seriously take out $1000 in cash and see how big of a stack it is.

168,IRS," Ah yes, because the probate process is notoriously quick.

My father died several years ago. His IRA was distributed within the year as were other accounts we didn't even know about - they had the duty to contact his beneficiaries and ensure the money went where it should. 

His uncontested will is still going through standard probate process and his bank accounts (what little is left in them after medical bills) won't be distributed until after that has finished. 

Simply using a will for stock inheritance also relies on the executor of the estate being aware of the account and introduces significantly more work for them, as well as introduces risk that the will could be contested.

Remember that with inherited accounts like IRAs you also have major tax implications if distribution is delayed beyond Dec 31 of the year after death. Unless you agree to a huge tax hit, a delay means more paperwork and filing for exemptions from the IRS, who are definitely known for being compassionate and forgiving.

185,TSLA," Theta is a concept to do with options. When you buy an option you will have to pay more than you would get back by exercising it. The extra bit is called extrinsic value. Over time the extrinsic value decays to zero. The rate at which this happens is described mathematically using the term Theta.

Most options (something like 75-90%) expire worthless and the seller gets to keep the premium you paid, which can sometimes be quite substantial indeed. So Theta Gang is a group of traders tangentially related to WSB who primarily *sell* options instead of *buying* them. Bull Gang buys calls, Bear Gang buys puts, Theta Gang sells to them both and then drinks their milkshake.

Theta strategies can incur staggering losses, though, if structured incorrectly or poorly managed. I think it was Opinion is Unpopular (the new top mod after the coup attempt) who lost several hundred thousand dollars chasing a few tens of grand from TSLA while it was on its initial runup. 

If you like learning from YouTube there's a channel [Kamikaze Cash](https://youtube.com/c/KamikazeCash) who talks about Theta Gang strategies a lot.

I've also made many posts today about the Tradesmith daily article, even if you do not believe it's happening, it's a very fascinating read.

But while maths are all good and essential, do you know why i am sure they did not cover without any damn calculations?

Because it's fucking Wall Street : Can you imagine borrowing 2.75B$ only to pull out like a pussy at the ridiculous highs we saw last week? First yes, the maths don't even make sense as you laid out, but more importantly, this short specialized HF would be the laughing stock of Wall Street, the manager might as well invest in $ROPE because their life after a move like that might just not be worth it.

You don't become top dog in a Wall Street HF by having paper hands and bend over because there's movement from a bunch of apes. These cocaine/adderall addicted sociopaths would not even blink an eye at doing a move like detailed by the SEC article and mentioned in the TradeSmith daily, they would not hesitate in fact to double down on their bets that *you* will paper fold after a campaign of FUD and ladder attacks, while they're hiding by selling deep-in-the-money calls (800$?) and even making more synthetics.

If you think Wall Street HF billionaires folded, i've got a 245$ avg GME shares to sell you.

The question now is if other Wall Street HF smelled the blood in the water and we might have more allies than we realize, not in *our interest* mind you, but in their interest to kill off many wounded competitors while making money on the way.",Lagviper,352,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldjbg1/analysis_on_why_hedge_funds_didnt_reposition_last/gm6rowg/,0.073,0.798,0.129,0.9198

196,TV," They're desperate for this to work. Keep in mind Melvin was already out 50% of their total capital last week. Keep in mind hedgies went on live TV to cry wolf about the regular American buying stocks they like.

They DESPERATELY want you to sell. HOLD. In fact, BUY.",SpeedoCheeto,241,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldjbg1/analysis_on_why_hedge_funds_didnt_reposition_last/gm6s1md/,0.25,0.703,0.047,-0.9471
197,SI," Nice...I like it.

One point though - if you are sure the Company is going to $0 - why the hell would you not short 140% of it? You only benefit. The trouble is when the price moves against you..you gotta move out and let someone else hold the bag.

Now >100% SI numbers are from Q3-Q4 2020. And then once the price started to move up - they probably short at <$6 - but they could've easily covered all the way ***up to*** the 27th - the market volume allows for that I think. In fact, I think they started covering once the price went above \~$10 - because as a short seller the only thing you fear is the stock price ramping up due to something you cannot control - in this case retail jumping in (again volume was like 10-15x normal).

The gamma getting jammed up is interesting too - but it prevented folks from getting insurance for a couple days only.

So..if 2/9 shows exchange SI is still high that means you could be partially correct and the scenario above (that they covered  ***up until the 27th***) is wrong and they didn't cover from 1/15 to 1/27. And that the more likely situation is that there are a bunch of shorts sitting deep under water at the current stock price of $60.

&#x200B;

Poke - holes in the theory please - the more we think this through the better our chances get at leveraging this potentially  >100%SI.

218,GME," Probably going to get buried with everything here but:

I was thinking about the GME situation in relation to today.

Checking the trade volume for 2/5, it's about 81.3Mm.

I remember reading on another thread that WSB holds roughly 14% of outstanding shares (sorry I can't find it right now). 

To be conservative: Let's say that each share changes hands 10 times today. This would give us a unique trade volume of about 8Mm. Using the 14% WSB ratio and playing around with 70% of those shares being purchased and 30% being sold (Why not? It was an active day and people saw the opportunity to buy and lower cost basis). WSB (retail investors) picked up an additional ~780k shares. 

We are left with roughly 7.2Mm shares picked up by institutions. I'd assume that because the price opened so low and considering hedgies pre-market magic, the shorts picked up a large portion of that 7.2Mm. 

I'll say 5.7Mm because it leaves a nice 1.5Mm to other hedgies trying to capitalize on this shit. 

You can bet your ass that Poppa Citadel and his cronies are taking the opportunity to buy OTM/ITM calls to farm those bumps in order to decrease the amount of money they need to recover on their playground bets. 
Sure, they've been rolling up their shorts heavy during last week and the one before, but when we saw that huge drop off the end of last week and through all of this week, there's no doubt they took advantage of the 🧻✋ and started closing some of their positions. 

Now, I fully believe they are still overextended and that the SI is over 100% (even if just barely). I'm holding my shares to the grave, after all. The SI held by the main malevolant bunch is nowhere near as high as it was during the 500s peak. 

I believe a solid part of the SI is held by retail investors trying to hop in before the big axe drops and slides GME back to fair value for good (many people just want to recover their losses and pray for some profit at this point). Another decent amount are held by smaller hedge funds that do this for a living, and the last ones account for the remaining positions that Melvin and Cit are finishing up with. 

We will probably see a consistent cycle of bumps and dips, especially leading up to the 9th when official stats are published. 
I'm not convinced we have a chance at forming a squeeze like we did before the RH shitshow though.

tldr; the squeeze was never squoze and now there's barely a chance of it happening as we talked about a couple weeks ago. That said, there's still a lot of opportunity to ride the waves on calls/puts to hedge losses or flip some sort of profit; decrease cost basis closer to fair market value and hold for the long-run.

A quick word for those who won't stop whining about Fidelity's UI: **It's not that fucking complicated**. Sure the site is crusty and there's an annoying amount of screens to flip through on the app, but this poor-as-fuck ape that knew or cared absolutely nothing about stonks prior to Jan 28th did a little term reading here and was able to set up an account on Fidelity's site, link bank accounts, transfer cash instantly, and order my share of GME in no more than 20 fucking minutes. And most of that time was wasted on waiting for security passcodes to arrive on my phone that I had forgotten was off like the smooth brain I am.

By this point we ALL know how shitty RH and most other ""brokers"" are at this point, so if you ***are*** in a position where you can put funds into something else like Fidelity or Vangurd (who we ALL also know have a vested interest in GME), quit your bitching about the UI on their site or app and take the few minutes to get the ball rolling on new accounts you can actually buy with, especially now that the stock keeps going on sale. An annoying UI is barely an issue when compared to the sweet sound of failing hedge funds that fucked us all over in '08. This is a unique and unprecedented opportunity, and all you have to do is buy, hold and wait.

A quick word for those who won't stop whining about Fidelity's UI: **It's not that fucking complicated**. Sure the site is crusty and there's an annoying amount of screens to flip through on the app, but this poor-as-fuck ape that knew or cared absolutely nothing about stonks prior to Jan 28th did a little term reading here and was able to set up an account on Fidelity's site, link bank accounts, transfer cash instantly, and order my share of GME in no more than 20 fucking minutes. And most of that time was wasted on waiting for security passcodes to arrive on my phone that I had forgotten was off like the smooth brain I am.

By this point we ALL know how shitty RH and most other ""brokers"" are at this point, so if you ***are*** in a position where you can put funds into something else like Fidelity or Vangurd (who we ALL also know have a vested interest in GME), quit your bitching about the UI on their site or app and take the few minutes to get the ball rolling on new accounts you can actually buy with, especially now that the stock keeps going on sale. An annoying UI is barely an issue when compared to the sweet sound of failing hedge funds that fucked us all over in '08. This is a unique and unprecedented opportunity, and all you have to do is buy, hold and wait.

They also believe their thesis as strongly as we believe ours and they are not covering I til it drip snack down to cost or below. GME is not going bankrupt now, so at some point shorts are going to have to cover with the least amount of loss.

238,RH," These are the guys responsible. They are the ones that told RH to have the margin requirements: the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation. A PRIVATELY held corporation that are not obligated to reveal anything or their records, yet they are in charge of the trading of PUBLICALLY listed stocks?!


Just some exerpts from the wiki alone https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depository_Trust_%26_Clearing_Corporation


1) Total assets US$46,971,101,000 (2018)


2) Several companies sued DTCC, **without success**, over delivery failures in their stocks, alleging culpability for naked short selling.


3) Critics blamed DTCC, noting that it is the organization in charge of the system where the naked short selling happens, alleging that DTCC **turned a blind eye** to the problem, and complaining that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had not taken sufficient action against naked shorting.


3) DTCC responded that it had no authority over trading activities, and **could not force buy-ins of shares not delivered**, and suggested that naked shorting was simply **not widespread enough to be a major concern.**


4) In July 2007, Senator Bob Bennett, Republican of Utah, suggested on the U.S. Senate floor that the allegations involving DTCC and naked short selling were ""serious enough"" to warrant a hearing. The Senate Banking Committee's Chairman, Senator Christopher Dodd, indicated he was willing to hold such a hearing. **No such hearing was ever held, however.**


5) Representing state stock regulators, the NASAA filed a brief in a 2009 suit against DTCC, arguing against federal preemption as a defense to the suit. NASAA said that ""if the Investors' claims are taken as true, as they must be on a motion to dismiss, then the entrepreneurs and investors before the Court have been the victims of **fraud and manipulation** at the hands of the very entities that **should be serving their interests by maintaining a fair and efficient national market**"". **The suit was dismissed.** Critics also contended that **DTCC and the SEC were too secretive** with information about where naked shorting was taking place.


Out of all these #3 has to be the worst. **could not force buy-ins of shares not delivered**. Can't enforce **FAILURES TO DELIVER**?!?! Then wtf?

243,GME," I was discussing the liquidity issue for short sellers with another user on here earlier. I presented my thesis, which is as follows: if more shares are sold short than are available in the current float then short sellers must buy up the remaining float until there are no shares left in which case they must bid up the price of the stock until shareholders decide to sell them the shares they need to close out the remainder of their position i.e. we set the price. That’s the whole point behind the diamond hands movement am I right? 

He then proceeds to refute my argument by stating that diamond hands method only works if retail+other institutional investors own 100% of the float. So if 90% of the stock is owned by the former and 10% is available, then hedge funds can just cycle those shares by covering in small chunks here and there, wait for the price to correct itself and stabilize (say GME is at $50 they cover a little bit and the price increases by 5-10% then corrects itself back to regular levels and they just rinse and repeat this tactic) with this tactic it seems they could cover over time without sparking a massive increase. All the while GME shareholders are loosing hope as the weeks go by and the price of the stock stagnates and fails to break out in a significant way. 

Can anyone refute or disprove this statement with good evidence? 

I am open to all arguments, even those that do not support my bias (GME bag holder here) because I believe it is important to hear educated opinions on both sides in hopes of creating a more well rounded understanding of the situation at hand.

At first I  threw $300 in an app a few months back and thought screw it, let's learn and figure this crap out... I've multiplied that 300 by ten, pocketed my initial 300 back to my bank and now feel like I'm playing with ""house money"". I feel like whatever I learn is worth the loss or the gain I make as long as I do actually learn something. And being an old school gamer, the memes, jokes and stuff have been an awesome bonus.

But as the arguments went on I would tuck little nuggets of truth (or my belief in the truth) away until I had enough nuggets to make tendies!

277,IMO," I agree that yesterday morning when we had back to back volatility halts is precisely what it would like when shorts start covering.

But a couple things to keep in mind:
First, did you see how fast the share price went up? There is so little liquidity that any significant buying pressure will raise the price exponentially.

Second, every time a short share is covered, it removes a share from the pool of shares that are being circulated. Institutional ownership is already OVER 100%, so that circulation pool can drop to 0 shares, and there will still be millions of short positions open. Sure they can re-short to drop the share price and add that liquidity back into the market. But that also gives savvy investors the chance to scoop up and hold onto an even more ridiculous portion of the total float.

the most important factor, IMO, is that as more shorts cover, the liquidity gets lower and lower, meaning the price increase accelerates.

So what we saw yesterday was only the mildest example of this.",hyperian24,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldjbg1/analysis_on_why_hedge_funds_didnt_reposition_last/gm80elc/,0.069,0.776,0.155,0.9136

280,GME, I believe they can only ladder when there is low volume because they are using few amount of shares (both because it’s more cost effective in that it requires less shares and because it is hard to come by GME shares now) this is why it was easy to manipulate the price when retail was crippled by their retarded choice of broker.

I believe all the DD thus far only ever used the traditional SI% interest, until GME started gaining popularity, at which point people started following S3 because they algorithmically predict traditional SI % and S3 SI % daily, so people started relying on these numbers since the true SI data is only released twice a month with a two-week lag. Sometime during this chaos of last week, people mistook the S3 SI % instead of the traditional one.  


This might be explained by  the fact that on Jan 29th, traditional SI was at 113% while S3 SI was at 53%.   
The Monday update showed that the traditional SI % was now at 53%, while the S3 SI was at 34%.   
Since the Friday S3 version happened to end up as the same as the traditional SI version after the decrease in shorts, somewhere along the way people thought the numbers had been fudged when really, they just misread it.

291,GME," I was discussing the liquidity issue for short sellers with another user on here earlier. I presented my thesis, which is as follows: if more shares are sold short than are available in the current float then short sellers must buy up the remaining float until there are no shares left in which case they must bid up the price of the stock until shareholders decide to sell them the shares they need to close out the remainder of their position i.e. we set the price. That’s the whole point behind the diamond hands movement am I right? 

He then proceeds to refute my argument by stating that diamond hands method only works if retail+other institutional investors own 100% of the float. So if 90% of the stock is owned by the former and 10% is available, then hedge funds can just cycle those shares by covering in small chunks here and there, wait for the price to correct itself and stabilize (say GME is at $50 they cover a little bit and the price increases by 5-10% then corrects itself back to regular levels and they just rinse and repeat this tactic) with this tactic it seems they could cover over time without sparking a massive increase. All the while GME shareholders are loosing hope as the weeks go by and the price of the stock stagnates and fails to break out in a significant way. 

Can anyone refute or disprove this statement with good evidence? 

I am open to all arguments, even those that do not support my bias (GME bag holder here) because I believe it is important to hear educated opinions on both sides in hopes of creating a more well rounded understanding of the situation at hand.

If the data on the 9th comes out stating that they still haven’t covered their shorts and it was all a bluff, and they still need to cover, then this is going to explode again.

Partially because I'm a sadistic asshole and catching an escaping rat feels glorious, but mainly for potential tendies... However I'm only doing the tiny tiny portion needed out of all the rat catchers. If I had a shit ton of money sure, but there's no way in hell I'm blowing more than 500 on this when my entire portfolio is only like 11k. 

The people going 500k on this have 11 mil portfolios. Do things based on what you're able to risk, don't yolo in student loans or some shit, and have at least some kind of plan...

Also I was able to get on GameStop back it was like 20 bucks or so so I made out with 9000 in profit.

634,DD," I think your edit is spot on. Disclaimer: (new user myself) With the many news outlets and fake posts here pressing silver, I think many are paranoid that anything, is a distraction from the one thing they are invested in, to the negative in many cases.

Most of us new users don't have a frame of reference to the past DD posts, and how things operate here on a regular basis.

If there is one real positive thing that comes from this whole gme situation, I think it's this. Many of us, myself included, have debated about getting into the market, learning and investing. However, we really didn't know where to start. We didn't know what to read. We didn't have some force lighting a fire under us to get motivated. Now, regardless of how things play out, I truly believe an entire group of people who would not have otherwise, are very interested in the market and investing. I feel like I've been reading non stop and trying to learn everything I can in a short period of time. There are probably thousands of people in the same boat.

705,BB," Likely. Here's what happened:

BB peaked at $28 when RH shut off buying. Media picked up a non-story of execs selling off stock at this time (this happens regularly as they are issued stock regularly as payments), and at the same time BB was massively shorted. (In regards to the shorts, I don't know where this data came from, but I read it awhile back, so speculate as you wish). This caused sudden and strong downward pressure, which shorts will profit from, but all of these pressures are artificial--people are still pretty bullish on BB. Then all it takes is the combination of retail investors recognizing the dip and media also taking retail side to reinflate and ride on the way up.

This is part of the reason why I went so deep into BB. I figured there was strong short-term support and long-term potential. I guess we will see if $29 PT actually comes to fruition, but I figure it's got a pretty good shot at it

If I tell you that virgin galactic is going to 100 because they're launching people before the next earnings report on I can't remember I think it's the 20th 26th. Then you run out and buy it. That's not due diligence. due diligence would be to verify that there is a launch happening before the next earnings report, then you would have to do an evaluation on what sort of impact can be reasonably expected from the launch. The honest answer is that it's probably not going to 100 at least not anytime soon.

Doing due diligence would be to evaluate the presented facts to see if they are accurate. Then extrapolating out based on known facts a probable outcome.

DD should not be something you can spike, but posts that are marked DD are not due diligence. they represent what someone is presenting as due diligence on their part which have led them to an opinion.

They can hedge with calls, which limits their short exposure and allows them to 💎✋their shorts until their calls expire.  If the calls were covered (see the gamma squeezes) then executing these options doesn't cause any additional volume, nor does it cause additional squeezes.

They can trade off the exchange in dark pools and OTC trades, hiding the fact that they covered from retail investors so that they can enter new short positions at the top, which is frankly easy money since GME obviously isn't worth $400+ in the medium term outlook.  These new shorts are 20 times as hard to squeeze as the old shorts.

They can renegotiate their short positions with brokerages, since brokerages don't want to be bagholders if hedge funds have to declare bankruptcy.

878,MVIS, I mean if you believe in MVIS it still isn't too late. The end goal for MVIS investors is a buyout by a large company which is expected to occur at at least a 2X multiple of share price.

927,TV," Very well said.  I am disabled and frankly, poor.  But I wanted to change that so for a while I have been putting 25 a month into the market. I used to be an accountant and have followed the market for years, but never had the money to invest.  I am too sick to get any life insurance or anything so I wanted to be sure to leave a small something for my family.  The best way to grow my wealth was to invest but would have to do so very small. To date, I have put $525 total into the market over time.  Most of my portfolio is just one or two shares of a few things.  Some are chuckling at me right now for being so small potatoes..but to date, I have earned a 28% rate of return by doing lots of research before I buy those one or two shares.  When I think it reached its ceiling I sell and then research the next one to buy.  Eventually, I will not be so small potatoes.

Don't listen to the people on here. Some are great and very smart, but some are just trying to play you for their own benefit so that your actions help their portfolio.  Also, don't trust just one source when researching a stock..including anyone on TV.  If you have a loss....take it as a learning lesson and ask yourself if your reasoning was wrong, or things just happened.

This sub is fun and does have some sound, smart people on here. Learn who they are.  But also learn who is trying to play you.  

Also, here like in the world, some people can be cruel and thoroughly enjoy your misery.  Don't let them add to your troubles.

931,GME," What I'm thankful for in all of this, is that it finally drew me in to actually make an account and get started, after so many years of ""Hmm I kinda wanna look into stocks"".  


Not because this has been brilliantly educational or that having bought 1 in the dip is something I believe in or expect really anything out of, but because the memes and the lightheartedness reduced the intimidating first step to something more relatable.

From here, I'll try to learn actual trading and I do not mistake this GME thing to be business as usual, or normal in the slightest. I'll keep watching, listening, maybe every now and then adding some funds on my account to wait until I actually know what to put it into.  


After all, having an anxiety disorder/social anxiety and it having kicked my ass for a decade now is starting to seem like despite all my best efforts and knowing what I **should** do when it comes to life, employment and social connections; I can't seem to beat the flaw that my brain chemistry is insisting on... where everything that should be trivial sends me into stress that manifests itself in physical ways.   


Stocks might be a way forward towards some sort of self-sufficiency. Taking back my life as I genuinely hate relying on some wellfare about as much as I hate sitting at home with a thumb in my ass.

936,GME," I'm loving all these Captain Hindsight and ""THIS IS WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE"" posts from people whose profits were made possible from the very thing they're now lecturing on.

Making a post to shit on ""losers"" after benefitting from their inexperience and trust rather than speaking up during is worse than those that profited silently. At least the latter doesn't pretend to be righteous about it.

I also think you're literally forgetting that towards the height of the peak, the majority of the post on WSB that kept mentioning diamond hands were more on how there's a lot of suspicious shorting activities from the big financial institutions, and the whole emotional appeal for people to hold in order to expose their dirty doings. While I have no doubt that the majority of the people who bought high did so because they wanted to FOMO the profit and thought it'd go to $1k, I do believe there were some that chose not to cash out their profits because they really did believe in fighting the corrupted system. For those that wanted FOMO, this was definitely a great takeaway (hopefully they've learned something from this in terms of investment - never to trust ANYTHING you read and always do your own research).

I found it interesting that at the peak, if you look at WSB, it was all about how shady RH, IB were, how people should keep holding despite all the shadiness, while some traders that continue to fuel the sentiment and suspicion, the ""fight the system"", literally did the same thing the system do and screwed all their fellow retail investors. You sold, profited, and literally gave the short funds the stocks they need, AS WELL as the ""idiots"" left holding the bag, because you played into their sentiments and trust. At least with the financial institutions, there are rules and regulations that demands transparency for their investment products, so that they cannot scam folks without the financial training.

Trading has always been a zero-sum game. It's something that most outsiders won't realize, just like how math is difficult for some people to grasp. Most importantly, those that doesn't have previous trading experience will still be exposed to all kinds of exaggerated messages from movies and news that may mislead their impression (such as forming a ""if the market goes up then everyone makes money!"" belief).

Edit for clarification: Trading is a zero-sum game because unless you're purchasing IPO shares, you're always going to be buying them from someone else who previously owned the shares. So if you're right about your buy, that means they're losing money for their sell. I'm not going to go in any more details/discussion on this, this is more of a general point for individual investors that's just purchasing shares/options through their brokers and not for a fund group/professional career.

I'm well aware that I'm going to be flamed for my comment, but I just wanted to point out the hilarious hypocrisy from the top posts since the last few weeks. I didn't lose much from GME, because I never bought the shares to profit (the stock price was way too high by the time I even took interest in the incident, so I literally threw in some chump change just to support the sentiment - also why I mentioned before in a post even during the hype that people should NEVER keep holding on for a miracle if they've put in more than they can afford to lose). If anything I'm more interested in some of the other data that were mentioned here previously, that everyone seem to have just forgotten. I will say the one thing I continue to learn everyday is just how low people can get, with new examples of why people will never be able to band together towards actual inequality because their peers will not only throw them under the bus for their own gains, but will actually fuel the fire while pretending to be one of them.

There's literally one every single year. Tilray, Longfin, Beyond, to a degree. Every year there is a massive pump and dump. GME is really no different. The hype surrounding it was pretty massive compared to the others, but I think it's the start of a new trend.

>No stock is ever a sure thing. 

Longfin was the only ""sure thing"" I ever saw. It was accidentally added to the Russell, so mutual funds had to buy it up. Then when the error was discovered, they had to unwind their positions. A ton of people made money shorting the stock. One funny aside -- a bunch of people who (stupidly) bought short-term puts were fucked when the stock was halted for weeks while regulators investigated the stock. *THAT* was a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

Say you made a shitload of tendies off of GME (you sold)

If you didn't reinvest it, your realized capital gains will be taxable at either the long or short term capital gains rate. What rate/ category depends on how long you held and how many tendies you acquired.

If you reinvested it (read: blew it on far OTM SPY calls) and suffered a loss but still have some of the original gains left, then you *only have to pay taxes on your net gains* (GME tendies - SPY retardation)

Squeeze GME was ""Put it all on 00"".

1043,GME," I'll debate that

I said selling at 70%- loss is retarded.

Then realize the squeeze happened when it jump to 400+ now it's just going back to normal price I think. 
The people who just believe are the ine buying and holding the price but I feel it'll keep tanking.

Sold at 70%- loss -2,600. :(

But I cap losses at 1k

Used that 1k for 3 OTM (not too much)  on a falling but great stock aka TSLA to start recovering.

So now I'm at 1.6k 

If I can 100% ROI on another solid long OTM I'll be back at the same moment before GME.

1044,TSLA," I'll debate that

I said selling at 70%- loss is retarded.

Then realize the squeeze happened when it jump to 400+ now it's just going back to normal price I think. 
The people who just believe are the ine buying and holding the price but I feel it'll keep tanking.

Sold at 70%- loss -2,600. :(

But I cap losses at 1k

Used that 1k for 3 OTM (not too much)  on a falling but great stock aka TSLA to start recovering.

So now I'm at 1.6k 

If I can 100% ROI on another solid long OTM I'll be back at the same moment before GME.

1116,TV," Ok, but the fact that it hit 500 at 5:00am CST mkaes me think we (the general public) didn’t have much to do with it skyrocketing like that, since retails and RH-ers in general can’t trade at that time. Hedge funds can, though. I was up that early that day and watched those huge instant swings of $20-30 in both directions, it was crazy. I’d sold at $320 the day before — not because of panic or wanting my gains, but because of how many former SEC lawyers were on TV talking about halting trading entirely for a week or some shit, and I didn’t want to lose everything. I DEFINITELY wish I would’ve waited at least until the morning but the thought of having it all wiped out was too much and...well I guess I did panic haha. But I’d literally never seen anything like it before so I’m not kicking myself too hard. I only made a couple grand and it wouldn’t have been life changing if I waited, nor would it have been life changing if it went to $1000 (I only had 6 shares at $59). My goal was originally to make at least $1000 profit and I did that.

1119,SO," Ah, thanks for that clarification. Im a retarded chimp, obviously. 
SO... who else thinks they will be issuing more stock then? 
Probably nobody.. though, it would make the most sense from a ""how the hell do we cover our own asses, and capitalize on this momentum?"" perspective. I suppose the HFs control the majority share in the company at this point too (after the squeezesquoze, if you believe that), which  means they could just keep issuing shares to borrow against until all the people who bought in cut their losses, effectively turning the squeeze back on ""us""..

2nd: I think people confused and attached the term ""short ladder attack"" to a theory which involves a combination of funds front running retail and multiple funds shorting during low volume / broker purchase restrictions and covering immediately. In theory, if funds did collude, then in a really well done and coordinated effort they could POTENTIALLY with a little bit of luck and getting market data like 1 second earlier than retail and executing with algos rather than manually entering limits like us retards, can maybe short and cover with shares from another naked short. Now it's tinfoil hat as fuck and hard to prove even if it did happen.  People probably took this concept, saw some fractional from people ordering in euros or whatever and took it as funds selling and buying at specific prices back and forth to each other where there were no other orders on the board. I think the key point you touched on here that people need to understand is that even if everything I said above is true, you can still only short at the price the stock is current at. So funds would still need more volume in shorts than there are bids to drive the price down. 

Additionally, even with the uptick rule in place, I believe brokers can still exempt shorts if they see fit with very little justification. Not sure about the mechanisms behind determine if a short can be exempt but my smooth brain might just be extra smooth today.

The most suspect thing about the whole GME situation is brokers claiming they ran out of collateral to handle the buy volumes last week. Like really?

1144,SI," I'm pretty sure the uptick rule is designed to allow long position holders to exit their positions gracefully (if they want to) rather than provide strict guards against driving the price down. If there is enough short sale volume compared to the buy demand, short sellers would still be able to effectively drive down the price even on days when the uptick rule is in effect. I think we saw that last week.

I think the uptick rule fails to prevent a quickly falling price in the following example:

\- Highest bid is: $50.00 for 10 shares

\- Let's say there are also bids at $49, $48, $47 etc.

\- Short sale is entered with an ask at $50.01 for 100 shares. Technically higher than the highest bid so it's fulfilling the uptick rule.

\- The order for $50 at 10 shares is filled and then also the $49 and $48 limit orders are filled as well through the short sale.

\- This sets the highest bid price to $47.

I may be exposing my lack of understanding in the fulfillment rule dynamics, but I think this is generally how short sellers can win on uptick days.

>once they **have to start covering** the price will skyrocket IF there are enough people holding shares?

Yes, but it's a big IF that many $GME holders are clinging to. Let me zoom in on the IF for a moment. What conditions would make shorts **have to start covering**? The borrow rate that short sellers were paying about two weeks ago was reported to be as high as 80% when the $GME price was squeezed to $300/$400. Right now, my broker has set a borrow rate of 9.28%. The borrow rates for short positions are nose diving while the stock price is nose diving as well - a double whammy that seems to have delivered the bears a massive win last week. The cost of maintaining short positions has dropped. I feel that many of the short positions have been managed quite well by HFs in response to the threat of a squeeze. There seems to be less pressure for shorts to cover immediately.

If I were holding $GME in anticipation of a squeeze, I would pay special attention to the borrow rate. Share lenders typically set the borrow rate based on supply and demand. If supply of shares to lend is low, the borrow rate is high. The borrow rate is lower right now (compared to say, two weeks ago), suggesting that there are an abundance of shares available to lend out. I believe the borrow rate is a good real time indicator the current short interest. I expect SI and borrow rate should correlate directly.

This suggests to me that the ""hold the line"" effort has taken a significant blow. If the effort were creating the conditions for a short squeeze, I would expect the borrow rate to stay constant or increase, not drop by 80%.",superdirt,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldk5o3/lesson_time_gme_was_shortsale_restricted_today/gm8mcy6/,0.044,0.816,0.14,0.9921

What is the contradiction dude? GME was short restricted and wasnt attacked on Friday. The day before, GME wasn't, until either a short attack or a selloff triggered the circuit breaker. We know how many new shorts were added on Thursday, so wtf are you talking about? Are you claiming the drop was due purely to selloff despite the short numbers? 


>for the remainder of that day and the next... we had multiple days were GME dropped 10% and then just continued to deep dive even while the Uptick Rule was in place.

According to the 13F's filed before the squeeze GME was owned by 90%+ institutional investors. Hedge funds that were long GME since Sept like Michael Burry's Scion Management. Who do you think sold WSB the shares they wanted? Hedge funds. Who do you think were smart enough to get out before the stock price crashed? Hedge funds. 





This is a story of hedge funds taking money from a few short-sellers that also happened to be hedge funds. WSB was late to the party and bought overpriced shares as the squeeze was occurring. And, now they're left holding the bag. Why do you think there are so many people still telling others to hold for another squeeze? Short interest estimates are down to 50% or lower depending on the firm doing the estimating. The chance for a squeeze is zero but the whole subreddit won't tell you that because they have a hard time facing facts.

1231,ON," Erm - there is hard evidence of media manipulation - silver, for one. Where did that come from? 

There is also hard evidence of bots being used to manipulate this forum - literally go look for yourself at the accounts naysaying and shilling just before the price shot up. It wasn't that long ago, and the posts are still there.

There is hard evidence of market manipulation - I'm not talking about cloak and dagger tactics either - TRADING WAS STOPPED FOR GME REPEATEDLY AND LIMITS WERE IMPOSED ON RETAIL OWNERSHIP. I can't stress enough how big a deal that is. That's like the dealer at the blackjack table letting the other guy have a couple of do overs while you are not allowed to do anything.... Just because. It's not anywhere in the rules. 

Memes and chants? It's an easy and amusing way to communicate an idea. We are informal, that is what makes this place fun. 💎✋ Is simply shorthand for 'im holding on'. 🚀 Is shorthand for 'I expect a price spike'.

1238,CEO," Nice man, sounds like a fun strategy there.

The reason i ask is because of the whole broker issue with the buying being stopped. I also got suspicious when it happened and started crying foul. But after looking into it, it is more likely a problem with liquidity. 
To put it short: Because of the insane volatility with GME, clearing firms upped the collateral of gme/amc etc to a 100% of the amount. Meaning robinhood and other brokers had to put down the full amount of the deposit and send it to the clearing house. These transactions ofcourse take 2 days to complete. Robinhood simply ran out of cash to process the amount of trades being done, if they hadnt stopped people from buying they would have had to come out and say they were completely drained on money, which is basically telling the world ""we are fucking bankrupt"". Not a good look. 

But then they came out and told people they were trying to protect investors from the volatility of the market? Why? I am actually starting to believe that they really wanted to protect people from themselves, because they saw the bubble had burst and it was about to get ugly if you bought in at 300+. (This is just a personal theory)

I also had someone tell me a european bank put a disclaimer saying you should be careful when buying GME (Just something i heard, cant prove it)

Ofcourse this was a stupid way of doing it and backfired completely, because at this point the WSB sub had massive media coverage and had mutated into a ""wE're gOnNa deStRoY wAllsTrEet bRo"" movement. Just fuel for the fire.

1240,SI," Regarding liquidity - why were there limits on the number of stock you can *own*? Not transact, own. 

I get that moving money around takes time, especially for zero margin brokerages, but to do so without warning grossly distorts the market, ESPECIALLY IF IT IS ONLY IN ONE DIRECTION. If liquidity is a problem halt trading, period. 

I don't think they were trying to protect anyone but themselves - ffs they'll let you buy all kinds of stupid shit on margin that's considerably riskier than this.

As for manipulation, I attest that I witnessed it firsthand. News reports of a silver rush here - there never was. Bots (I know one when I see one) pushing all kinds of shit and naysaying - a mod coup here on WSB that was defeated. I can't point to individual instances - I don't have that kind of time right now, but I guarantee you'll find it pretty easily, and what you find for yourself will be much more convincing than an example I cherry pick.

I think what happened is that we almost set off a financial singularity that would have essentially infinite value, sucking in all other money if it had worked. Consider the scenario where more than 40% of the stock of a company with 140% SI is held in a retarded grip. Shorts eventually HAVE to cover, and in this scenario, as the remaining stock gets bought up, the price cascades up. When all available stock runs out, the remaining short positions are essentially a credit card in arrears, and we are the lenders (we're not, but we are the only ones who can grant relief). A multibillion dollar credit card balance with no upper limit.

That's a *lot* of money, especially if the stock price has already mooned. This was never about the shorts covering. This was about pinning them to the wall so that they couldn't, and then seeing what happens from there.

1351,GME," to post what I posted without the part that got my post deleted:

&#x200B;

collective holding can be useful I guess. There was something that rose spectacualry and then went down like crazy and I mocked the people who lost a lot especially because at first there was huge media hype and then when it went down there was shadenfreude over people like the Dutch guy who sold everything he had and put all his family's money in this thing. And then it suddenly rose again and those who held onto it where overjoyed and in both cases I did wonder man, what If I bought that when it was worthless, and later: man what if I bought that during it's fall, I would have been rich!

And  then this GME thing happened and I desperately need money and I don't  want to miss out on something spectacular like that thing again so I  figured fuck it, my regular stocks (dividend stocks) aren't doing well  and aren't even paying dividend, sold those and bought GME at 320. My  only option now is to keep buying during every drip to lower my average  and then hopefully manage to squeeze some money out of the volatility.  And pray that if I hold a year or a few months from now it explodes  again because of reasons or because the short squeeze hasn't actually  happened as some people say. I don't fucking know what to think of this  subreddit, who's the real savant? who's just a pumper? who's the  hedgefund shill trying to peddle desperation and doom? who's a desperate  idiot like me just trying to hold on to the idea that things will work  out?

One  thing I did notice and that really bugs me is that the folks saying  ""1000 or 5000 is not a meme"" never answer when I ask them for an  elaboration and where this number comes from especially because it's  those posts that led me to buy GME in the first place and to convince my  retired (yes retired living on his pension, not fucking retarded, it's  not a fucking typo) dad to also buy GME and I'm currently down 79,68 % I  lost almost 3000€ I never considered that money really there anyway  because it's you know, stocks and I was never going to use that money  unless it grew exponentially. But when my wife finds out how much I lost  then ""my wife's boyfriend"" probably won't be a fucking meme for me.

1450,DBX," Heres why DBX is an insane value play right now:

 

to start with their balance sheet:

* $1.1 Billion is cash and investments.
* ZERO long term debt (this is uncommon in the tech growth space, especially the cloud sector) .
* With all this cash on the BS you are technically only paying \~ $7 Billion for a $9 Billion public market value.
* 25 forward PE which is crazy low when you look at the growth potential and compare to competitors premium in the space (most trade in the 100 - 1,000).

Market cap of $9 Billion

DPX is cheaper than when it went IPO

It is undervalued compared to cloud computing competitors.

Hellosign acquisition undervalued compared to competitor of $DOCU which is worth $45 Billion On its own.

$DBX should be trading 4x higher than it is currently based on the premium other investors are paying for competitors in the space

* Large short float (7.4%) meaning squeeze potential as upper long term resistance is tested on volume, Stops will get triggered.
* Relatively low float and market cap meaning it wouldn't take a lot of volume for this stock to trade 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% higher on a day with big news. Low supply of shares with high demand will cause price to go up.
* Not many cash flow positive business have float structures this luctrave.
* They are unlikely to sell new shares to the public if it does gap up as they already have lots of cash on the balance sheet and a cash flow positive business model. **Low risk of share dilution.**
* Closest competitor to Hellosign market cap of $45 Billion
* This is 4x the size of $DBX which is at $9 Billion. Hellosign could grow to the size of $DOCU.
* $DBX has a big potential $DOCU competitor with already great business and growing e-workspace business.
* You are paying a cheaper premium for $DBX and it has more growth potential and is already profitable.
* The selling pressure from $DBX has stopped and insiders and institutions are setting up long positions to play value tech.
* $DBX has begun to break trend and outperform major markets.
* Options activity on the 1 year chain shows a substantial long bias with traders accumulating calls.
* $DBX will gain sympathy from a strong IPO market, cloud computing market, and tech market.
* Investors who missed $DOCU 560% YTD run will look to add $DBX due to the HelloSign acquisition.
* Relative rotation shows capital is flowing out of large cap technology into value tech.
* Institutions have increased their positions by 50,000,000 shares.
* **Institutions own 84% of $DBX**
* A total of 463 institutions hold $DBX and 217 of them have recently added to their holdings.
* There are 60 new holders who recently accumulated a total of 11,675,563 shares during the long term channel on the daily chart.
* There has only been 7,766,483 shares sold by institutions during this trading channel.
* This signals institutions are net long $DBX on a break of this channel and will look to add momentum lots to their position",mattrimcauthon,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldzkog/can_we_get_back_to_posting_about_other_stocks_yet/gm9md9f/,0.049,0.829,0.122,0.9895

1487,GME," Years ago, while holding a true medical breakthrough MNKD who has an amazing inhaled insulin, they would naked short sell the stock daily for years and always coordinated dumps of fraudulent shares with hit piece media articles that would be used to justify the dumps. They pretended that A led to B and it was all a natural process, when in reality naked short selling planned the news drops which were always filled with BS FUD. Seeking alpha was a primary culprit but many others got in on the game.

There used to be a true hero who automatically made charts of all the failure to deliver information that was easily searchable (from SEC data) and you could see clearly the carnage they were not only bringing to MNKD but other favourites they used to attack.

Difference with GME is enough people figured it out before they could bury the stock under 90% losses and demoralize everyone in to selling for pennies on the dollar.

Sirius satellite radio was the poster child for this process, and I believe it was the mercer family who picked it up around 10 cents a share, down 95% plus. The naked short selling rule was called the ""madoff exception"" because Bernie madoff helped get the rule in place ""to help provide liquidity to the market""

Since then, the markets have been completely rigged, and it doesn't matter how many shares are bought of a company the price will always go down. They just need to sell more shares at any point to overwhelm the buying. GME should issue a special dividend if they really want to catch these short sellers flat footed, that seems to be the only real weapon against this fraudulent enterprise.

1526,GME," I am fairly new to all this stuff, got hyped up in the GME craze. Investing has been something I have been interested in getting into for a long time but never found a reason for entry until GME. While I definitely FOMO'ed on this one, I feel like if it wasn't for GME I probably would have delayed my learning longer than I already have.

Ever since this has blown up I have tried educating myself on many aspects of investment and theory behind data and decisions. There is a lot to learn, not only about the market but also about myself and how to make calculated decisions without being swayed by emotion. The hype of massive returns was too good to be true but I still bought into it. 

One thing I am doing currently in order to get my feet wet with trading is using the thinkorswim app which has a paper trading option to use fake money in the stock market. I figure if I can get fundamentals and mechanics down by studying and applying ideas into the paper trading, then I can see how my strategies and ideas play out. Not exactly a fool proof plan for money but I believe that if I can educate myself and learn, I can make better decisions than using hope to sway my choices.

& it’s tougher now since I was able to learn a lot of info here on this sub prior to the 7+ million new users coming in — not too say there isn’t valuable information here at all but it has become much tougher to navigate.

As far as YouTube, there are a ton of large channels that focus on different types of investing & depending on your personal style, you’re gonna want to find one in that area.

My favorite YouTube creator in this niche is “Kamikaze Cash” — he covers a lot of wallstreetbets biggest and most notorious trades as well as posting educational videos about options (greeks, iron condors, straddles, and other option strategies)

If you are looking to collect dividends and get paid by companies (a small portion per share) quarterly or annually while holding long term shares — look for channels who cover dividend investing (I want to say Graham Stephen is the guy for this one but I can’t recall if that’s his name).

You may want to find a certain sector to study — whether it’s industrial, cannabis, retail, food and beverage, hospitality, aerospace, etc. and focus on that as well to narrow down your lesson plan.  I personally spend most of my time in tech and EV sectors playing major stocks like $AAPL, $TSLA, $WKHS, $MSFT, $NVDA — when playing blue chip stocks, or household names like Apple and Tesla, your risk is naturally lowered as these companies provide a huge sense of security as far as maintaining value.  This risk can only be increased through option contracts with a rapidly approaching expiration, or over leveraging on a spike and then having to wait out dips for days, weeks, or months.

Technical analysis is the basis for a lot of traders as well.  While I myself abandoned TA around the beginning of the pandemic (where I believe a lot of technicals became disrupted) but there are tons of traders and advisors on YouTube and so on that focus solely on reading charts and pulling rainman level shit with the squiggly lines.

I’ll do my best to create a follow up to this thread where perhaps some of the older community members here could help me assemble a real guide we could get stickied or locked into the content guidelines.

It’s tough because wallstreetbets was never about learning or deep extended conversations on the market intricacies.  Since I’ve started lurking here it’s always been trust fund kids and deeply depressed rich guys throwing their money around at huge option bets.

Even without participating in the market myself for a bit, I was able to see what trends were popping off here, what WAS working — more important, what WASN’T.

The mere fact you have an account here can be beneficial, provided you put the information to good use.  The key is to stay away from the mob mentality that the market is a team sport, or that anybody named DM_YOUR_DIRTY_ASS has your best financial interests in mind.  

Trends and waves can be fun, and make money, but risk tolerance  is an individual thing - I made plenty of money off GME & that contract I sold for 9K went to 20K an hour after I sold & worthless the next day.  I’ll chalk that up as a win.",outofthemoneycalls,18,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldn9px/new_traders_please_read_in_regards_to_gme_market/gm7wpjd/,0.051,0.731,0.218,0.9942
1538,GME," Thanks for reading & great question.

I actually ended up selling the contract for around $2,500 the next morning as GME opened with a slight 5% pop in premarket and did eventually spike higher (that contract finished yesterday slightly under $2,000).

So with contracts you are essentially purchasing THE RIGHT to buy 100 shares per contract at your strike price if you choose to exercise.

Contracts premium prices will always be displayed that way (ex: a $15,000 contract would be displayed as $150.00.

Since I’m flipping contract premiums I typically don’t exercise to buy the underlying shares — you’re not required to & this limits my risk each time to ONLY the amount I paid for the contract premium and nothing more.

That $56.60 number your seeing is my strike price.  Since this was a put contract (betting on the price dropping) here’s the breakdown:

The contract I bought was for GME to drop to $71 per share by 2/12.  $71.00 minus (would be plus if this were a call contract) premium paid for contract ($14.40) = $56.60

That means even though I bet on GME dropping to $71 per share, the premium I paid makes it so my true strike price (where I’d actually be able to exercise if I wanted to) is $56.60.  It would have to hold that price point or go lower by my expiration date for me to make the most $ off premium or exercise on the day of expiration.

Hope this helps a bit.",outofthemoneycalls,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldn9px/new_traders_please_read_in_regards_to_gme_market/gm860lr/,0.043,0.854,0.103,0.9472
1539,GME," These informative comments are a welcome change to actually start having some discussion in this sub again between the meme posts (we all needs memes once and a while), and I completely follow the sentiment that a lot of new folks looking into trading will be good for the market, and in the end this sub too. But a lot of people have probably gone in over their head, gotten tunnelvisioned with the group/movement mentality and are taking huge losses that may scare them away from ever trading again.

I have been a lurker on WSB for a few years now, and always wanted to learn more about this stuff. I knew that this sub maybe wasn't the most optimal place to learn, but the more high octane trading always allured me more than the safer long term play of ensuring a good retirement (probably still the smartest thing to do, but hey.. life needs something to live before that).

A friend said that the best way to learn and get into stocks is to just buy some. This way you are invested (his pun not mine) to actually learn about what you have gotten yourself into, and the learning will come naturally. So I pulled the trigger on GME and got a good position before the surge. Panic bought more when I thought the squeeze was happening with a market order that came back with a price of 420 (meme stock yada yada). Have since then averaged down to around 188. But through the last 2 weeks, I have learnt more about stocks and the market than I could have possibly achieved at any other time. Sure the loss hurts, and has taken slightly on me mentally, but I will manage. And I feel with a new trading account starting out in the red, it in a way gives more motivation to try to learn more and bring this thing back and in the green, without hopefully taking many years to do so. 

I got an investing and finance book bundle from Humble Bundle not too long ago. Not sure if it will turn out to be the greatest learning material, but you have to start somewhere.

Will come back to your posts again and again as a reminder to stay the course, and pick up on what I am missing. Thanks again!",0illuminati0,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldn9px/new_traders_please_read_in_regards_to_gme_market/gm8zhzx/,0.06,0.81,0.13,0.9871
1540,GME," Thank you for you calm and level headed approach to all this. I got into trading a couple years ago and I've been yoloing little bits of cash into my account since. I'm a little South of $1000 in my account now because I've only ever been playing with ""whatever"" money, seeing people talking about actually throwing their whole everything into GME made me real nervous for them. 

Full disclaimer, I have 1 GME (the only one I could afford at $92), but that's because I have hope for it. And if it fails, oh well, I've wasted $100 on dumber shit and have less to show for it.

It really is amazing how much the '*rally to $1000 coming any day now'* comments mirror '*the storm is coming any day now, Biden won't get inaugurated'* comments from the QAnon folks.

The only thing that's funnier is the idea that '*we're taking down Wall St!'* Because a $10T hedge fund like Blackrock is going to lose sleep over a tiny player like $2B Melvin Capital having a rough week. Speaking of which, Blackrock made more money on the GME thing than every retail investor combined, but don't mention that.

It really has been transparently clear from the beginning that the smart money was going to get out, and that simultaneously encouraging the first-time retail investors to hold was misinformed at best and actively malicious at worst.

My gut tells me it will settle around $8 in late March, but mainly due to AMC recently shedding debt and I feel like it's a more fair valuation of their share price. On top of that, they've still managed to recover even through the pandemic so anticipation of re-opening could help with that $8 price.

Did the MM even bother to hedge this... because they knew they’ll just drive it down below 100 on Monday. Shake out the paper hands and cover the delivery of those calls and buys later in the week. 

It takes a 2-3 days to actually receive delivery of the shares, albeit from exercising a call option or buying shares. Likely being filled by a MM (Citadel). And as share owners, we don’t even know if we have received the shares... it could be a failure to deliver and we wouldn’t know. Our brokerage would know. And it would be extremely advantageous for Citadel to fulfill the delivery of the shares after a large naked short barrage to drive it down. I’m really curious to see the failure to delivers that come out of last week. 

I think GME has just been mutilated and manipulated all to hell. SEC, MM, HF, brokerages, clearing houses all benefited from GME volatility mean reverting. So don’t expect any finger pointing from this. They’ll only point fingers at Reddit for disrupting their efficient market.

1618,GME," >Yeah but there was huge amount of call options that had expired ITM last Friday

Deep ITM options expiring ITM doesn't mean shit because those are already hedged. MMs don't wait to buy shares. Those options already had deltas of near 1.0, so MMs had already picked up those shares PRIOR to expiration.

EDIT: This seems to be a common misconception here that lots of ITM options will somehow cause a gamma squeeze. That would only happen if MMs waited to hedge until expiration, which seems like a losing play because it means they letting their delta grow and then buying all the shares at a higher price.

Options expiration really only affects options that are ATM, whose deltas are not close to 1.0 or 0. Any options that are not ATM are most likely already worthless or fully valued by expiration, hence no additional hedging is needed. The ATM options have deltas going into expiration, so there are hedged shares tied up with those deltas. When ATM options expire, those deltas get unwound...but ATM options only make up a small fraction of MM delta (especially for GME) so the effect is largely negligible. If you look at SPY, ATM options delta is more noticable which can result in price movements as ATM hedges get unwound. But I don't think that's relevant to something like GME.",Retricide,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le1kor/the_gamma_squeeze_explained_gamma_theory_for_monke/gm940y7/,0.042,0.83,0.128,0.966
1619,AMC," >Since volatility has been increasing a lot, it means that net option buying has increased? 

Not necessarily; more likely the opposite, in fact. The rising implied volatility (IV) is suppressing options buying because it's making options more expensive- hence, deterring a lot of WSBers from buying FDs and lowering the number of contracts whales can buy. That's why high IV/more expensive options cripples a prospective gamma squeeze.

IV is a measure of how much you can expect the underlying to move. IV often increases with sharp moves down (i.e. the VIX and SPY), but it can also increase with moves up (i.e. GME, AMC, BB). Higher IV means the Black-Scholes model is pricing in larger movements \[in either direction\]. High IV raises option prices because it increases probability for the buyer and risk for the seller.

>What do you think about max pain theory? max pain for options expiring next Friday seems to be around $80. 

Max pain theory is the idea that a stock will pin to the price that causes ""maximum pain"" for the option buyers, therefore minimum pain for the option sellers. For speculative stocks like GME it's probably fine to assume MMs are net short puts and calls, but that is not always the case; SPY, for example, MMs are considered to be **long calls** and short puts. That's another discussion, but it disproves max pain because MMs are net long one side of the equation, so they don't want their calls to expire worthless.

Proponents of max pain theory believe that MMs will buy/sell stock into expiration to try and achieve that ""max pain price."" To me, this is totally counterintuitive to how MMs work. MMs don't make money from their options positions, so trying to drive price in one direction just creates unnecessary risk for them. Another point is if they did try to manipulate price into expiration, whose to say that MMs wouldn't have slightly different max pain levels and thus their buying/selling would just offset/cancel out.

Instead, I think max pain is an artifact of the gamma structure. Assuming MMs are net short puts and short calls (again, not always the case but probably relevant for GME), then max pain is where the net negative gamma is smallest, leading to the smallest moves in price. As price moves away from max pain, negative gamma grows for puts or calls and fuels more movement.

TLDR; I don't believe max pain results from MM's buying/selling to manipulate price into expiration. Instead, I think max pain is a secondary effect of the gamma structure and it leads to price pinning at the smallest negative gamma level- the ""max pain"" level.",Retricide,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le1kor/the_gamma_squeeze_explained_gamma_theory_for_monke/gma0aev/,0.183,0.787,0.03,-0.9981

1681,SI," Yes. The report on the end of January from January 15th.

The data gets submitted twice a month, and then the data is made public a little bit over a week later. 

So the data from end of December was like 140%. Data was released early/mid January, right when short squeeze talk really started popping all around. 

The next official report from the data on January 15th, came out end of January said SI (short interest) was down to 88%.

Currently projections done by professional firms who run these numbers say it was around 36% when the data was submitted at the end of January. 

This data falls in line with the declining path of the previous two reports. Not to mention the 2000+% increase in the stock price. 

Certain users deny. ""Oh no, that wasn't the short squeeze"". 

February 9th will be the data from February 1st. 

They will either deny it again, saying it's incorrect data and you now need to wait for the current data from the mid of February to the end of February. 

They agree with the 140% when it's in their favor. They deny the 88% but later say the 88% is correct and you need to wait for the next data. 

Meanwhile everyone outside of this sub is saying the shorts covered, at least all of the soon expiring shorts. You can cover a short and then do one much longer out. 

It will go on and on like this forever, because the short interest will never be 0%. Ask one of these people to give you a number % of SI where the short squeeze won't happen. Then go look up other stocks that have that same SI number, that people aren't running around saying it's going to moon. 

People will deny the numbers, say the current numbers are different and say you have wait and hold the line. 

Meanwhile the stock will be $20 and you'll still be holding. 

The hard truth for people is that the run is over, the shorts covered and the stock went up 2000+% because of it. You can roll shorts out longer, it will never be zero. You can cover and buy more later out. You can cover and just walk away. 

Everyone's big talking point was they can't short over 100%. And that's true, and when the price shoots up over 2000+% and a large HF loses over half of their worth in a few weeks and has to get bailed out, and the official SI number actually drops by like 50+% points in a matter of 2 weeks.

1682,GME," Net positive earnings.  GME had been losing money nearly every quarter among with declining sales.  The holiday report suggests this is swinging in the other direction given underperforming store closings.

If you add the likelihood of debt reduction due to a share offering and war chest increase, you have a serious bull case.

1772,GME," Used to live about 3 blocks from their headquarters. There is literally a line down the block when they do special releases and events. Also their sales floor is pretty cool, you can even build your own custom figure.

Edit: thanks for the award kind stranger! If any of you degenerate ever visits the headquarters, take your wife’s boyfriend to the Mexican restaurant el paraiso for their carne asada.

Edit2: another edit because OP seems to be getting some hate. While the company isn’t massive, they are expanding. While I lived there they continued to move into vacant office spaces and hire more people as the company grew. All it would really take is another sports franchise or multiple franchises to contract them for special release pop figures. Have you ever seen a 10k person line in front of the worst baseball team in the MLB(Mariners) to get special edition pop figure before a game? Prolly not because you were either smart enough to send your wife’s boyfriend to stand in line for you or you’ve lost enough money on GME to not afford Seattle rent.

You discovered you were on the wrong path. If you learn from your mistakes then you can become a better investor in the future.

The problem starts when someone doesn't admit defeat and keep losing over and over again. If you see that you're winning then you wait for the best moment to sell and make good profits (like many OG members did). If you see that you're losing then you sell, cutting the loss and trying again, unless you have a damn good DD and diamond hand it till the end like DFV did.

1886,GME," Why this ape is holding

I’m dumb ape with dumb thought

REASON IM HOLDING 

     First off, sorry for the poor structure I’m on mobile. 
Second disclaimer, I’m an idiot, full blown ape holding onto 1/4 of my hard earned 100% return in 8 long months of investing. 

     I’m going to hold until Cohen takes game stop to the levels we know it can reach. 

     Also because these 💎🤌🏻 won’t let go of this baby rocket, papa Elon hasn’t even installed the electric jets to the rocket yet.

     Think, right now majority of games are sold/downloaded through Microsoft and Sony. Correct me if I’m wrong and there’s actually a 3rd party distributor (other than the publisher of course). 

Now imagine these following possibilities 

1) Downloaded games on hard drives can be saved and redistributed.
                A)You trade in your old Xbox or old play station. You can wipe the hard drives of personal data while saving game data... set new serial numbers to the data so it can be redownloaded and distributed to hard drives for future play/backwards comparability.
               B) this comes with the possibility of game stop exclusive releases of new consoles with pre loaded hard drives that contain used games they’ve purchased off older hard drives. 

2) game stop takes a more aggressive stance on the  competitive game scene with in person tournaments.
                A) possible partnership with twitch/other streaming services. This could happen sooner rather than later because multiple game stop locations could have large tournaments with retail locations around the world.
                B) with possible twitch partnerships this could bring revenue for more twitch steamer merchandise being moved in retail locations. 
 
3) Sec finds shares of GME are in none existence and they fuck us over and claim x amount of “fake” stock will be reclaimed (maybe at face value) from the most recent x purchases.
                A) I’m holding onto what I got until the end, because a funny feeling tells me as this all plays out we might see some wild shit to say the least. 
                B) until everything settles with the suits and the many lawsuits I’ll be holding my shares. Although if it drops below $30 I am eating it up, no crumbs left behind. 

                                       Summary

               I’m in no way a financial advisor, this is not investment advice. I truly like the stock and I believe with the growing possibilities for future e-game distribution and multiple innovative minds at the helm of GameStop, this train can turn around and bring us back to the 🚀🚀🚀🚀. 

TLDR: I’m holding because it’s not a loss until you sell, and these 💎🤌🏻 are better than your grandmas spaghett.",yenom08,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldzk6p/you_people_need_to_understand_that_we_like_the/gm8qtlo/,0.11,0.817,0.074,-0.933
