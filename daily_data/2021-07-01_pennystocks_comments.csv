9,DD," That's my current plan. I am still in profit but not nearly as comfortably. 

With no catalysts til then to offset such a brutal sell off which itself is following an insane run up, I'd be surprised if it doesn't gradually dip for a while from lack of steam. I was planning to take my initial out when it got above $5 like I was sure it would, but seeing what's happened, I am playing it safe and getting my initial capital out now while there's still some profit left. If I had known that the stock was flying or dying (at least short term) over a halt announcement, I definitely wouldn't have held it all til today. That'll teach me to get lazy with staying updated on DD. 

Regardless, knowing that the next serious catalyst is such a ways off, I'd rather have my bases covered and get that cash back to my chest then just leave it at the market's mercy for several months with no clear momentum drivers. Even if it finds support soon, earlier this year showed us just how brutal a market correction can be to small cap stocks.

12,CTXR," I haven't checked things out recently, so double check everything I say.  But my understanding was that no halt = trial ends in December 2021, which would likely lead to FDA approval in early 2022 (not Q4).  

So check that, but that is why I sold and will buy back in months from now -- I swing trade and like to buy big when I invest, so I don't like tying up my money.  If my portfolio was just small investments in a bunch of long term stocks, CTXR is a great investment to hold.

As someone who was just stuck holding TRCH for months instead of selling, I highly recommend you sell if you are tying up a big chunk of your portfolio in CTXR.  You can sell this week for $2.8, then invest your money elsewhere for months, then buy back in at $2.3-2.5 IMO.  Sometimes taking a loss isn't a bad thing.  I know you're young and have no debt and all that, but unless you only invested a tiny amount and plan to invest a lot more, you want liquidity.  

To give my example, I bought TRCH at $4 in February, and it went up to $4.8.  I didn't sell because I thought it would go $5+, so I could have made a quick 20% and didn't.  Then it dipped and I averaged down several times, ended up with a bunch of money tied up at $3.8.  I didn't sell at breakeven because I thought it would be back up quickly.  Then I watched it dip, and dip, and dip.  I could have bought at $1.5 at one point.  In the end, I made money because it finally went up like I thought it would, so it wasn't a BAD trade.  But had I sold at breakeven ($3.8) or even a slight loss ($3), I would have invested that money for 2-3 months and then bought in with double the shares.  Instead of making $10K, I would have made $40K+ IN ADDITION to investing the money.",PsycheRevived,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/obm1vv/citius_pharmaceuticals_inc_announces_positive/h3pebnp/,0.05,0.843,0.107,0.9699

If you have <10% of your portfolio in CTXR, then average down and hold.  If it is >10%, then I suggest you find a good exit point in the next week and plan on buying back in before the next catalyst.

19,PDAC," To be fair PDAC and ABML are similar in many instances I just like the set up and prefer the management team of li cycle better. 

The one I really get excited for is American Manganese. They have an amazing recyclo process that is closed loop and environmentally friendly already hitting standards that are further ahead than any competition. Also I love the fact they are focusing on cathode material and their plan isn’t massive factories but to set up in existing factories saving companies hundreds of millions in wasted materials. They also have just proven to be about to take older cathodes and recycle them into a product that can be directly used into new ones cutting out steps. They already have a mou with itavolt and have parents now in South Korea and Japan among other countries. They don’t have contracts yet but it is primed to explode once they do and there isn’t much in the way of direct competition for what they do. 

Also they have a contract with the us government to process the wenden stockpile for manganese in which the US is 100% import dependant currently. They also have some mineral properties but their main focus is recycling. 

I recommend that anyone actually interested in this industry have a look at AMY and where they are headed.

One framework I've seen (maybe rementioned on Fatty's DD) is would you be more upset about selling at X and it runs up to \[price target\] or holding and it dropping to \[your worst case thesis\].   


Personally (my risk tolerance and thesis re: ATOS, not necessarily yours) is that I like the stock enough and am enjoying the IV selling calls enough that, although I'd love a quick 4-10x pop, I'm okay with holding for the longer term, averaging down, and waiting for phase 3 and/or an acquisition down the line.",aimaguru,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/obd6ig/the_loungedaily_plays_july_01_2021/h3oi6m0/,0.092,0.746,0.161,0.8823

198,ATOS," agree with everything you said.  

although positive sentiment doesn’t = positive price action, i really do believe there is strong belief and support in ATOS and the huge bounce backs it’s had after dips recently makes weeks like this not as emotionally challenging imo.  

i am curious however if the week of the 16th starts and the price is still hovering between $6-7, will people start to heavily unload and we see an even more dramatic drop in price?  imo next week is going to be the real “catalyst to the catalyst” so to speak.  but what do i know!

199,DD," I think if the price remains stable now at $6-$7 for even just a couple of days, it’ll start attracting more people investing for a squeeze (or, pessimistically, investing to take advantage of squeeze hype). If it drops to ~$5 (as I believe it will) and then goes back up to $6, then that means it’s already growing, and the momentum will keep building.    
   
My only worry is if it keeps dropping for too much, or drops for too long without stabilizing (I don’t know how much power short/naked call manipulation have towards that, and stop limits are still a concern). If it ends up $3 on the 15th, that doesn’t exactly bode well for a squeeze :p. But like you, I’m just speaking my thoughts rather than any real DD.

210,GLBS," There are a few things I'd suggest, not so much for regular chart settings, but for some perspective.  Your charting platform might be able to display when a split occurred. Even if you don't have TOS or something fancy, Yahoo finance can do this - there's an option under ""add events"". An 'S' will show up on the chart if you zoom out far enough to see it (some platforms might even show the split ratio.)

Then you can also change the scale of the chart to logarithmic. The reason being, when you zoom out there's a tendency to think the stock's trajectory is improving, because it's flattening out after falling steeply. But it's an illusion, because dilution acts like a logarithmic geometric series. Say the company is worth about 20m on average, but they lose 20m per year and therefore need to raise 20m every year. That would mean they would roughly have to double their share count each year (in reality likely much more because shares are issued at discounts,) and once the cash is used up, they're worth the same as what they started with, but value is split across twice the shares. So share price will be down to 1/2 the first year, 1/4 second year, 1/8 third year, 1/16 fourth year. For someone who held through all that, they lost 50% of initial investment the first year, 25% the second year, 12.5% the third year, 6.25% the fourth year. But really, his holding is being halved each year, he just has less money left to lose over time. Logarithmic scale reflects this well - if the stock drops by a relatively consistent percentage each year, the chart will show a clear, downward linear trend.

Now consider that there are penny stocks who've literally increased their number of outstanding shares by over 100x in a year!  Unless the value of the company is rising at a similar pace (never the case,) the share value is going to drop off dramatically and force a reverse split to regain compliance with Nasdaq. Like GLBS did last year for example. They've done something like 7 offerings and increased their share count by about 300x in just over a year. That crushed their stock price to about 5 cents, their 1:100 reverse split regained them compliance and they continued on with more offerings. It's a never ending cycle, unless the company becomes profitable or at least a lot more promising. The odd one gets kicked off Nasdaq if they say enough is enough. But you look at some of the companies still on there, and you know Nasdaq doesn't make a point of being the bad guy.",stompingllama,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/obrphh/penny_stocks_always_seem_to_be_in_the_tens_of/h3qab6c/,0.053,0.797,0.15,0.9931
