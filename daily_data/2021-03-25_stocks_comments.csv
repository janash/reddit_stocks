1,VLO," Peter Lynch One up on Wall Street - that will give you some great perspective of a successful career over 30 years of dips, corrections, crashes. IF you have Kindle unlimited, you can even read it as part of your subscription.

I am also new to this, got into trading in January, was up and now am down to about level. I sold some positions at profit, and reinvested in some new ones, or even the same ones after the dip - like VLO.

The main thing I am learning is that there is so much noise from so called experts who are experts at talking (or writing) but nothing much else.

Makes me a little uneasy, but at the same time - confident, in the long run. 

Yes Tech took a big hit, but the type of tech stocks also matter. If you bought your tech from the opinions on others, from FOMO, or because its the latest Reddit trend - well, good luck.

If I buy a stock, I've hopefully done my due diligence and i'm looking at the 3 and 5 years out I don't care if it dips here and there, plus starting Jan we knew the re-opening was going to be volatile and tech stocks would be hit hard.  If you want slow and steady jump into value, blue chip or index funds. 

If you don't like the losses you should have an exit strategy in place. Personally i'm down 30-40% on some stocks. At the time I looked at where I thought they will be in 1, 3 and 5 years and bought. The earliest I'd evaluate their performance is later part this year or 2022, its tough to predict the short term but much easier to predict the long term.

I jumped on a few trades based off of advice from the people on CNBC and got burned on a few and made money on a few. It’s like a 50-50 risk therefore it’s just not worth even getting in. Now I use the analysts as a way to gauge macro sentiment. Another thing I’ve noticed is that they are past thinking, reactionary and that is the opposite of what an investor needs to succeed. You have to be forward thinking.

Balanced *investors* are doing fine. The big index funds are all very green YTD. A balanced long-term portfolio should feel fine right about now. Probably green on every chart maybe except 1M.

*Traders* however are probably suffering right now because of the shift out of tech (which im assuming reddit traders are heavily into), combined with the fact that nothing is making any sense to the average retail trader. The stock market is notoriously impossible to predict but right now it feels like Jesus could come down from heaven and personally bless AAPL headquarters and the price would plummet, only for it to recover if they announce historic losses the day after.

If those people and/or institutions are giant players making giant corrective/ reflexive moves into/out of certain positions, all the other little fish in the see are going to react to the massive waves caused by these whales and panic out of those same positions, causing that wave to compound and grow. All the computers used by large institutions to execute thousands of sales and contracts per second also get hit by those waves and pile onto the rapidly turning waters, eventually getting to the point where even the smallest disturbance causes massive overreactions throughout every sector until things finally calm down again.

Who wins? The whales. They shape the market in the image that benefits them the most with one massive sale, or in some cases one tiny tweet. Also, institutions that have caught onto the pattern here and adapted the software they use to exploit the situation as much as possible.

83,GME," Someone replied to me to ask why May is a red month, but I can’t find the comment so I’ll just leave this comment here for shits and giggles. 

It’s based on the last 70 years of statistical data. Historically May has had zero returns over the past 70 years so we tend to see a bearish market. April, November, and December are statistically very bullish times while August and September are bearish on average for stocks. This is where the “Sell in May and go away” saying comes from. October through April is where the bulk of stock market returns come from historically. 

Month: Number of times with positive returns;  number of times with negative returns = Average return. 

January: 42 up years; 28 down years; average return = +0.98%
February: 40 up years; 30 down years; average return = 0.00%
March: 44 up years; 26 down years; average return = +1.06%
April: 49 up years; 21 down years; average return = +1.36%
May: 41 up years; 29 down years; average return = +0.09%
June: 36 up years; 34 down years; average return = +0.03%
July: 40 up years; 30 down years; average return = +0.93%
August: 38 up years; 32 down years; average return = -0.26%
September: 32 up years; 38 down years; average return = -0.57%
October: 43 up years; 27 down years; average return = +0.68%
November: 47 up years; 23 down years; average return = +1.42%
December: 52 up years; 18 down years; average return = +1.37%

We can’t predict the rise and fall of a stock, but we can time the market based on these statistics but as I was just reminded, you have to remember to factor in unprecedented news that may see the fiscal year become an outlier to the norms - i.e. a global pandemic sees the market behave in a very unusual way to the norm. Apes buying GME because they “like the stock” is not the norm. So we aren’t in normal circumstances and therefore May might not see it’s usual dip trend in stocks across the market.",GhostChameleon,1,/r/stocks/comments/mcxmx4/i_thought_the_stimulus_checks_were_supposed_to_be/gs6v3tc/,0.032,0.939,0.029,-0.4396

102,GME, idk why you’re getting downvoted. it’s true. feelings aside if you look at the facts it’s 100% true. the Beta on GME is -11 last time i checked.

105,GME," It’s actually true. There’s a literal metric ton of evidence to prove it. GME is probably one of the only safe hedges against the massive broader market correction this is likely to cause as large funds with way too much short exposure get margin called and forced to liquidate their big successful long positions. Look at the 6 month chart for all the major indices and big tech, there’s inverse correlation with every spike in GME, on Jan 28th, feb 25th, and today, March 25th. Each are 21 trading days apart, which is the maximum length of time market makers have to settle the massive amount of failure to delivers. I agree that WSB is a wretched hive of scum and villainy, but they’re actually right this time. The r/GME sub is literally loaded with crowd sourced due diligence backing up this theory, and today it’s playing out for the 3rd time out of 3. I highly recommend studying what’s going on at the moment, and if you don’t have the stomach for wild volatility, don’t buy any GME, but I hope you have some dry powder ready for when SHTF. This is the hedge fund and institutional equivalent of the “pouring cement down the toilet” during the 2008 housing foreclosure crisis. They’re absolutely trying to take everyone down with them, and beg for a bailout after.

123,CCL," I don’t think Fauci banning cruises will/is as easy as you’re making it sound. I held CCL last year at $26 and was told it was going bankrupt but now it’s come back to those levels again despite them not operating and cancelling cruises left right and centre. This is a big industry and billions are invested, I don’t think the suits in the industry will admit defeat and accept bankruptcy easily. I’m sure some dirty politicians will be getting paid to fight for the cruises to be back in business if it has to happen. They just made a very big ship recently and I’m sure they’ll want a return on that. While they may loose some revenue from the US, you need to realise that US is not the only country in the world. There’s Europe as well and and other countries.  As unsafe as they are, people are tired in being locked in so I don’t think cruise fans will be giving 2 phucks that much as long as there’s some good precautions taken to make sure that people are safe. 

For those who are holding, don’t loose hope. I sold mine at a loss because I thought the price wouldn’t recover but I don’t regret it. I lost some money but over all, I learned a good lesson.

If we can find cheap air travel we will leave from New Orleans or Miami and spend a day or two there before the cruise.

158,NIO," You should be careful with what everyone says. This is why rhetorical thinking matters. People are very biased and will try to convince you into thinking in a way that best suits there own agendas. The color of the candles are forms of manipulation. Stocks imo are a big psychological game.

Wanna know my recent example? With the Chinese delisting fears once again being brought up. My friends who are NIO bulls will say the SEC delisting fears are nonsense. Then my same friend will sell and try to time the bottom and try to create fear by making a big deal about it. But once he buys back into the stock he goes around saying it's no longer an issue and it's just ""noise"". 

Another example is all these articles being posted. This is why I always want to know where investors are coming from. I wish there was more transparency. I don't use WSB like I did years ago. But I loved the ""position or ban"" rule. Then you can see why someone is bullish or bearish on a stock. It makes much more sense why someone says certain things.

Yikes.....That’s all I gotta say. 


It’s been noticeable that the quality of posts and comments have gone down with the influx of novice investors. It’s due to a lack of experience, however thanks to the Dunning-Kruger Effect these people often feel superior to seasoned investors....including Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch and academics. 


It used to be that I’d come across down right nonsensical (worse than bad) posts or comments every other week. However in the past month that number has increased to once every other day....and sorry but it mostly comes from the dividend investing crowd and the TSLA fan-Boiz. 


Today I was trying to explain to someone what Dividend irrelevance theory is...and somehow this person determined that you can have a 13% “guaranteed” rate of return no matter what the stock price does; meaning the stock can crash 90% and your rate of return is still +13% or more for the year. Well turns out this guy calculates his rate of return by the number of shares bought buy his DRIP per stock....rather than growth/loss in the value of your investments. And ofc he felt like he cracked the investing code of ancient wisdom that us plebs don’t know. So his idea was to buy high yield stocks, hold on and never sell....according to this user it was impossible to lose money with a dividend stock because it always pays a dividend.....I think this takes the cake for worst advice/logic I’ve seen on this sub and that’s saying a lot.

Well. They just made 150% on GME. Us plebs on average double our money every 7 years and they did it in 1 month. We just don’t know anything about investing. 


My favorite is when you can show they’re wrong yet they’ll say “well that’s not how its done.” An example was some guy was saying a stocks’ yield is a theoretical number and I showed him that it’s annual dividend/share price and he was like “that’s not really how it’s done, the rich don’t calculate it like that.” He was confusing yield on cost and some pseudomath to come to the conclusion that stocks have a 200% dividend yield after 5 years or something like that...so a stock with a 7% yield, you 2x your principal every year after 5 years was his theory.

200,MSFT," I’m not gonna get into dividend irrelevancy because you seem cool and well thought out. So you keep doing what has been working for you. 


> People also are starting to look at growth in an odd way. Expecting a 2T company to meaningfully grow is strange to me--how much appreciation milk is really left in the cow lol.


I know right. However I also think about it this way. 


1st) People said a $1T market cap was impossible. 


Fun fact: If you adjust for inflation, MSFT back during the dot com bubble didn’t break $1T in today’s money. It got to around $950B in today’s money. 


2nd) People then said $2T market cap was a barrier that couldn’t be done. I assume the next is $3T, but who knows when that barrier will be broken. 


Now I agree with you, how much can a $2T company grow? If it were to double that would be $4T which is insane.

255,GME," On my Roth IRA which I consider long term I treat it like a garden. I don’t have anything more then 5-10 percent of my portfolio unless it had hyper growth like tesla.  I trim it wear it needs it an add seeds that I feel that will grow while nourishing my main crops.

When tesla hit more than 10 percent of my portfolio last year I trimmed it down to about 7 percent. I sold between 700-780. I then redistributed that into how I keep my portfolio which is give or take, 50 percent index/etfs 20-30 percent large and mega cap tech like faang, 10-20 percent cash or hyper growth speculative stocks like PLTR Spacs weed and cash for dips.

Unfortunately I don’t have cash right now for dips since I’m bagholding right now but that’s what I usually do during a downtrend anyway since I’m with the time in the market vs timing the market group at times like these.

With my individual broker account I’m more aggressive and WSB style type of investor but it helps when you take 1k to 6 figures in a year. It does hurt to see it fall about 40 percent in the last two months( bought spacs on top of the SPaC bubble which is probably the hardest hit sector) but fortunate enough that GME gains help me keep my sanity.

I had a lot of trouble getting my money out since February and held stocks that fucked me big and didn’t want to sell due to not wanting to ruin the transfer.

277,DD," The whole “diversification” concept isn’t necessarily true for everyone. Diversification really only serves a few purposes. It can serve as wealth protection (hence a lot of wealthier people diversify, it would be foolish to put your 100m net worth into 1-10 stocks. They’ll tend to spread it further than just the stock market, eg. real estate and other fix income assets and even private investments). Diversification is also good for people who don’t want to research into the stock market, but want to also participate in market returns. 

When you invest in individual stocks, you shouldn’t really be looking for average returns because if you are, you can just diversify/ buy and index. 

The most extreme example I can give to illustrate this is this: take the s&p500, and say this year only 1 company out of the 500 companies will be positive. So in order to outperform the market here, you would need to have invested most of your money into that 1 company, otherwise you will be underperforming. For people who can’t be bothered, or don’t think they’re smart enough, they can just buy all 500 and have the average return. 

With regards to your holdings, if you did your DD and are in it for the long term (holding for years to come) just don’t open your portfolio.

343,GME," You mean until retail investors figure out how the system works and stop looking for massive short term gains. 

“There no free lunch.” In every market there’s winners and losers. HFs lost until they won. The first time around retail won huge it was amazing. The second time around the only thing that changed wasn’t some looming squeeze it’s that HFs leveraged their position and knew exactly how the other side would react.

Is it fair, IMHO yes. There was a massive profit available for retail twice now. A lot didn’t take profit or bought in late due to FOMO. Most of the ones who got in late hit a jackpot opportunity to walk clean. A step further I’d argue retail fell victim to the same level of greed that they shame HFs for. Retail was driven by an unrealistic target and tripled down with their potential gains into demand-saturated options.

Full disclosure I’m not a shill nor rich. But volume was down low which was a huge indicator the levels weren’t sustainable. I personally cashed out the second wave at $200 and threw profit into puts because the price didn’t make sense. The ridiculous demand driving the deep OTM options market was pure ignorant greed. Literally I started opening calls less than two weeks out at $400-500 and taking at some points a $40 premium.

GME I hope can be a huge lesson. It’s not that Wall Street is bad or us vs. them, it’s just use common sense.

IMO it's as simple as- Bumble is popular with women, and women drive the dating market. Women, especially ones who are more attractive, prefer Bumble because it's easier to weed out the creeps. And men want to use the app with the hottest women.

Also, I think dating apps will see a resurgence with everyone vaccinated. People be horny yo. Though whether that's already priced in, who the hell knows.

455,TV," I think the reason I'm taking this correction so hard when it isn't that even that big of a drop is because it's teaching me that I'm playing a game with people I don't understand.

2020 taught me that the stock market had nothing to do with reality. 

During a pandemic and one of the worst bouts of unemployment the US has ever seen, the stock market doubled. 

Elon Musk became the richest man on earth, not because his company was making a lot of money, but just because people liked his memes.

By 2021, I feel like retail investors had learned all this and we were ready to play this like a game -- and we did. We skyrocketed a failing company to more than $400 a share, not based on fundamentals, but entirely based on memes.

The problem is that, when we did that, it became painfully clear that the other people playing -- Wall Street and the Boomers -- don't realize it's a game. They went on TV talking about ""the fundamentals"" and saying things like, ""I get Tesla's valuation. That one makes sense to me."" when Tesla's valuation really just should not make sense to *anyone*.

That's the frustrating part -- realizing that the long-time players still think that their insane movements are based on fundamentals. So much so that, now that we're reopening, they're saying: ""This Amazon company is about to become obsolete. Dump all of that and put your money in the stocks of the future: Coca-Cola and Kraft-Heinz!""

Last year taught me that stocks have nothing to do with reality. This year is teaching me that they have everything to do with what Wall Street *thinks* reality is.",wsb_shitposting,17,/r/stocks/comments/mcu9cu/rstocks_daily_discussion_options_trading_thursday/gs68s89/,0.106,0.786,0.108,-0.1851

If yes, then the company has pricing power and might be worth keeping because they will raise prices and sell the same amount (higher margins).  I don't buy high end gear and wouldn't pay much more for something marginally better than the competition but you would know better than I would. 

The other reason to think that the stock is going to go up is if you think they will sell more.  Do you think the number of PCs sold will be 10x or 100x more?   Or maybe the number sold stays the same but 10x or 100x more of them shift from INTEL to AMD chips or from (I have no idea who the competition for RAM is) to Coursair?   The third reason would be if you think they have new product coming that will  (without cannibalizing existing products) sell 10x or 100x?

560,GME," So sorry to hear about your loss. Very smart and caring of your mother to have a good insurance policy in place. Looking after you even after she’s gone. That’s a good mother.

You’re job now I think is to be a good son/daughter and do good by your mother. I think first you need to fulfill any high interest rate debt(s) your mother may have had. These can haunt you if not taken care of. 

Then from there I would really ask yourself what you’re investing for. Is it for a nice home? To do right with your mother’s policy? These are all rhetorical questions you’ll have to figure out yourself. Once you know that, develop a plan to meet whatever long-term financial goals you may have. 

I know $500 is very minimal compared to what you have available, but I wouldn’t put anything in GME, or any volatile stock, unless you’re willing to lose it. No one can predict these things. Don’t let Internet people fool you into losing a good nest egg your mother left you.

Regardless, I think you should be investing for the long-term here. We’re talking years and not a get rich quick scheme because that just won’t work. Over time though, you will amass a nice balance if you’re diversified, ride the waves of the market, and hold.

I think your best options are Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). These are individual shares you can buy that are already extremely diversified across a given sector of the market and managed by firms who charge very tiny fees for you to own them. There’s some that mimic the Dow, the S&P 500, Nasdaq, etc. The returns of safe ETFs that mimic the market are very low risk and offer a decent return (10%+ per year). These are your best bet in my opinion. Your portfolio should be made up of mostly (75%) safe, broader market based ETFs. I would invest 20% in riskier ETFs that have historically been positive, but on a bigger return basis, so maybe 25%+ a year. The remaining 5% or less I would treat yourself to whatever you see fit. 

Losing a loved one can be rough and you deserve a nice vacation, new TV, etc. to help you take care of yourself mentally and physically. Maybe use this time to figure out the best investment strategy for yourself and heal in a way.

I wish you all the best! I know you will do great by your mother and yourself. Best of luck!

You’re job now I think is to be a good son/daughter and do good by your mother. I think first you need to fulfill any high interest rate debt(s) your mother may have had. These can haunt you if not taken care of. 

Then from there I would really ask yourself what you’re investing for. Is it for a nice home? To do right with your mother’s policy? These are all rhetorical questions you’ll have to figure out yourself. Once you know that, develop a plan to meet whatever long-term financial goals you may have. 

I know $500 is very minimal compared to what you have available, but I wouldn’t put anything in GME, or any volatile stock, unless you’re willing to lose it. No one can predict these things. Don’t let Internet people fool you into losing a good nest egg your mother left you.

Regardless, I think you should be investing for the long-term here. We’re talking years and not a get rich quick scheme because that just won’t work. Over time though, you will amass a nice balance if you’re diversified, ride the waves of the market, and hold.

I think your best options are Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). These are individual shares you can buy that are already extremely diversified across a given sector of the market and managed by firms who charge very tiny fees for you to own them. There’s some that mimic the Dow, the S&P 500, Nasdaq, etc. The returns of safe ETFs that mimic the market are very low risk and offer a decent return (10%+ per year). These are your best bet in my opinion. Your portfolio should be made up of mostly (75%) safe, broader market based ETFs. I would invest 20% in riskier ETFs that have historically been positive, but on a bigger return basis, so maybe 25%+ a year. The remaining 5% or less I would treat yourself to whatever you see fit. 

Losing a loved one can be rough and you deserve a nice vacation, new TV, etc. to help you take care of yourself mentally and physically. Maybe use this time to figure out the best investment strategy for yourself and heal in a way.

I wish you all the best! I know you will do great by your mother and yourself. Best of luck!

Yes, there is technically a chance - but very unlikely. , If you're paying interest, at least pay off all but 10k to minimise the interest adding up, then, if there if forgiveness, you can get the final 10k forgiven free.

But from what I understand, if my return on investments are more than my 5.5% interest on my loans, Id be doing good right? I do owe 38k.

With that said if it falls below $120 with a low IV before EPS I’m going all in on calls.

They’ve just been quiet since last EPS after getting violated for making too much money. Making solid moves, through more buybacks, their expected earning estimates went up generously, and there’s the looming prospect of a formal announcement of the car which will probably cause another runoff.

That's the right attitude to have, in my view. You being bearish on GME is your genuine opinion, and you want the best for other people. I appreciate you sharing your perspective here in a kindhearted way. Encouraging people to think through their investments is a great thing, and if we come to different conclusions on a security, that's the way it goes. As long as everybody's comfortable and happy with the level of risk they're taking, and they're informed on the risks, then it's all part of the game.

Taking the stock way too personally is something people on both sides have been guilty of. Even though I'm still invested in GME and am hopeful it will continue to do well, I don't appreciate people who are bullish on GME mocking or being nasty to people who aren't on the hype train, either.

673,AAPL," Long story short there are different types of orders when you buy a stock. For example if you buy at market there’s some wiggle room in the price and is executed at the quickest time of delivery, but your price isn’t entirely locked in. Limit orders you set your price floor or ceiling and are put into a transaction queue until the underlying value gets to that point. Generally brokers will protect you to match your order with the closest available one. 

So let’s say you try to buy a single share of AAPL at $200, you’ll likely just get on the first available purchase order that meets sufficient volume to execute. You won’t pay $200, but I wouldn’t make it a practice of it. This could become a VERY dangerous practice if you were to buy in large volumes on a smaller less active share. The ticker reflects the last transaction price. If demand is low and price comes down to meet supply it’s red and vice versa. If the price were precisely $200 and you bought for $200 nothing would change. Changes reflect a differential in what’s being paid and what’s asked.

**TLDR** At a very fundamental level a stock’s price is really only driven by supply and demand.

There’s a lot of interesting theory behind it depending on your interest in mathematics and statistics. A lot of the terms thrown out so often now, <insert squeeze or sell off here> are just edge cases of extreme activity of limit demands and supply. This is why I’ve found GameStop interesting as an example. Theoretically there’s a limit to any share value relative to the underlying equity, growth, implied risk, sentiment, and any other factor. Then if you abstract it a bit to a buyer and seller level this changes at an entirely different level since many people are deterred by a stock like Berkshire or Amazon with high cost. 

As an example of a completely recalled estimate I made a few weeks ago so numbers won’t be perfect. At $350 a share and around 70m in outstanding shares with ~$6.5bn in revenue GME’s market cap to revenue ratio was 3.79. As a contrast, Amazon is around $3.1k with around 440 million shares floating (which don’t rotate as often) and $386.1bn in revenue so a ratio of around 3.526. Effectively GME was more valued than Amazon without any of the intrinsics. When people boast pipe dreams and expectations of $1000+ this is why I found it interesting that people valued a company well beyond that ratio. There are definitely other factors, but at it’s core I find that to be an indicator of a price limit. Nobody looking solely at business expectations and growth prospects would value the two companies equally.",arrexander,4,/r/stocks/comments/mcl06w/are_stocks_bought_and_sold_between_individuals_or/gs46ufl/,0.031,0.777,0.192,0.9978

679,AAPL," If there's a bunch of buy limit orders at 199 and a bunch of sell limit orders at 201, in a closed system nothing would happen. No trades would execute. Basically a gridlock. 

But the thing is there are so many people trading that there will also be a plethora of market buyers and sellers for a stock like aapl. Every second or so there will be people placing market orders which means ""buy this for the cheapest I can"" or ""sell this as fast as possible to the highest bidder""

I understand your questions in your post , but the thing is there are so many transactions going on that it's hard to analyze like you are trying.

Rather, think of it this way. Millions of orders are entered into the system. Some market buys, some limit buys, some market sells, some limit sells. And then a giant software system runs the analysis and pairs buyers with sellers and determines which stocks exchange hands. It's too big of a system to work it through on paper and pencil.

If youve ever sold a large amount of stock at market you'll see this in action. Sell like 500 shares of AAPL and you'll see ""37 executed at 200, 28 executed at 199.6, 62 executed at 199.2"" etc. You're basically pacman ""eating"" the buys on the way down. And the opposite for buying a large amount of stock. Buy 500 of any stock and likely you will get shares for sublle penny differences.

Bear Case: Niche retailer who took a large impairment charge in 2020 which took them to a sizable loss. Will face ever increasing competition from online mega giants, and they have a material debt overhang.

Bull case: Even the absolute worst retailers are trading at a 30%+ revenue multiple premium from JOAN’s current levels.

739,CAN," You may be able to occasionally ""snipe"" an option but its rare.

Ex. Someone is either happy with their gains (green day) or trying to paper hands (red day) and sells at a price above the Ask price but selects ""Good till closed"" instead of day.

Aftermarket delivers a massive swing overnight but that lazy trader doesn't adjust the ask price so you snipe it early morning (If your broker didn;t snipe it first and they do).

Essentially you have to hope that ask price is in the magical zone between what your market maker sets as the algo-arbitrage buypoint on one side and the buyers Ask above market at previous days close.

If you bid higher than the previous days asking price and ""catch"" their ask price (without the value being within the algo buy zone of the market maker).

**TL;DR**   
For an option snipe (buying an option at greater than its intrinsic value) you need an alignment of 4 things; a lazy trader that sat an ask point above the previous market ask and was lazy enough to be ""good till close"", an after market swing large enough to make that ask price be lower than the actual value, the value must be lower than your market brokers algorithm for automatic arbitrage buys, and you must have the highest bid on the option.

The only platform I have been successful with this is Chase YouInvest. Their options are extremely limited BUT their arbitrage buying is dogshit. I have sniped two options for less than their intrinsic value on HUNDREDS of attempts.

Questrade is cheaper for major stocks and worse for pennies. I don't use it much but the trading platform is way better than RBC.

For both, I convert money to US funds and never cross funds. The exchange fee is 3% each way (6% total). It's a deal breaker if I have to pay $20 plus 6% on each buy/sell pair.

I aim for profits of a few hundred dollars to keep the trade charges at a reasonable percentage. It makes the minimum investment a little higher.",Y1OG4,1,/r/stocks/comments/mcltvm/i_am_in_canada_which_platform_offers_best_fees_to/gs4hflo/,0.054,0.879,0.066,0.5267

791,TD," The only possible explanation would be the exception for ""substantially identical"" securities. I'm not a tax expert but if you bought what someone with more knowledge than myself would consider ""substantially identical"" to the securities you sold then the cost basis for those securities should be increased proportional to the loss you recorded on the original securities. Under no circumstance should losses be permanently washed out. Talk to a tax professional other than TD Ameritrade or file a complaint is all I can advise you to do at this point.

I guess it's worth mentioning the following scenario:

You buy 1 XYZ stock at $100 cost basis on 3/1/2021

You buy 1 XYZ stock at $80 cost basis on 3/5/2021 (Blended cost basis is now $90)

You sell 1 XYZ stock at $50 cost basis on 3/9/2021

It's not entirely clear to me if the full $40 loss would be added to the cost basis or if only $20 of the loss would be added to bring you back to the full $100 cost basis, but the loss may be added to the cost basis of the remaining 1 share as part of the wash sale rule.",EvilModerateLiberal,1,/r/stocks/comments/mcy2vl/help_me_understand_this_wash_sale_rule_in_taxes/gs6ou39/,0.11,0.788,0.101,-0.4422

Performance in lockdown for WMT shouldve been higher with the advantage it had but it was less than half of it. If it cant win in conditions suited for it, what confidence can you have in revenues expected to decline? the market also isnt rational.. next time they see a big dip in revenues, WMT could dip again (even with expectation priced in).

1.  Cash.  Good time to boost savings.  If I get it high enough I’ll look for a CD or higher interest money market account.
2.  Index funds.  Mostly vanguard but the really low expense ratio if you believe the market will rebound and grow is worth it for long term.  Less expense means more compound interest.
3.  Options and riskier stocks. Mostly this is to learn options and maybe make some money.

855,OR," I don't think there is ever a clear bright line as to anything with a fundamental, but they are key things to consider. 

Generally, I keep it simple and compare PE and EPS to sector averages. If the P/E is too far out over a sector average it can be a red flag. If it is too far below, also a red flag. But even still both scenarios can represent opportunities. a high P/E could really simply be a rapidly growing stock and that is a company you need to be in with. something to keep in mind is prices are live, earnings are not. an inflated P/E may suddenly be not so inflated when earnings are updated...

And a low P/E could mean the company is actually crappy... OR the stock is way undervalued and there is growth opportunity.

856,PEG," The short answer is because Benjamin Graham told me not to. The longer answer is that projecting earnings, especially beyond the present quarter, seems to have a VERY low accuracy and precision rate. I'd be interested in seeing the results of some sort of study or metastudy on that.

I look at live P/E, which is based on ttm earnings, and I also calculate a P/E based on the 3-yr average of earnings. I calculate PEG based on that 3-yr P/E and the avg yearly growth rate for the last 10 years.

P/B I calculate yearly based on the latest 10-k (or foreign equivalent). Anything less than 1 is very good. Anything less than 2 is reasonable.

It's much safer to use a 5- or 10-year trend to try to ""predict"" future growth and earnings, and thus get a price target for a stock, than the company's self-reported projections. Granted, both have risk and inaccuracies.

871,RH," I’m a big fan of TD Ameritrade. Fidelity and Scwhab are good options too. I’d avoid Robinhood and Webull and similar brokerages at all costs. They make their profit by more freely issuing margin and selling off their trade volume to a larger brokerage, Citadel. Basically RH pools orders together until there’s a sufficient volume to execute. That’s why they were caught up in a $150m settlement for lost profits to their clients.

Can’t speak for user experience, but TD’s thinkorswim platform is great. Little annoying at times but overall I like it.

873,IBKR," NZ here - I know a few locally use TD and some IBKR (myself included). Apparently the sign up for TD is quite onerous, while I didn't think IBKR was too bad. I feel like the learning curve can be quite steep, but you can always do paper trades (fake money) until you work it out.

I had previously used Hatch, which I liked, very accessible and easy to get started with, but limited if you want to do anything more than simple stock trades. Possibly similar to Commsec?

I'm unsure if fidelity is viable for us, I haven't really heard of anyone using it (but they may be?)

Unsure if this helps, but should be slightly closer to home at least!",CapBBeard,2,/r/stocks/comments/mcl6k8/what_is_the_best_online_brokerage_company/gs52unw/,0.074,0.809,0.117,0.7648

876,CARR," Call me crazy, but JOAN looks to have timed their IPO at absolutely the worst time and looks like an opportunity. Generally I don’t touch retail stores, but the numbers here drew me in.

Bear Case: Niche retailer who took a large impairment charge in 2020 which took them to a sizable loss. Will face ever increasing competition from online mega giants, and they have a material debt overhang.

Bull case: Even the absolute worst retailers are trading at a 30%+ revenue multiple premium from JOAN’s current levels. Even at my absolute most bearish valuations, where they’d still be the cheapest retailer I can find in the market, there’s 8-10% easy upside. When you consider they’ve generally turned a profit, had been consistently growing revenue YOY, and it’s being reported will be offering a $.40 dividend this looks like it may be another CARR situation where there’s 100% upside just to normalize valuation.

I hope you didn't the same mistake that a lot of misinformed and lazy people have done and bought that security. RLLCF is worth literally 1pence a share. Not more, not less. 

You see, if people actually did their DD (not attacking you, just ranting at people laziness in general) they would read through Rolls Royce investor information ( as easy as a few clicks on their website) and they would know that RR paid dividends in 3 different ways. Ca$h, RR stock or RLLCF shares. The RLLCF were redeemable for exactly 1pence whenever the company announced that they would be accepting redemptions. 

Right now, RR is not paying dividends and logically are not accepting redemptions. The only way to make money with RLLCF shares is to sell them to some poor bastard who doesn't know better. 

I hope I haven't come across super rude :D the thing is that these shares spiked hard a few weeks ago because some smartasses thought that they had struck gold and a lot of uninformed people followed suit based on hype... and that herd mentality, especially misinformed and dumb just rubs me the wrong way.

In general I stick only with sectors and industries that I am familiar with.  That way, I know pretty quickly what to look for in terms what their product or service is, and if it's of any quality.

Then I'll look at their ""fundamentals.""  Their revenue, assets, profit, and debt.  I like to see a history of these numbers for the past 5 years, if the company has been around at least that long.  There are more fundamentals, but those are the four I look for.  As you read more and more of these about more and more companies, you'll learn more and more about which details there matter.

Try to find moves the company has made to get better position.  Sourcing deals, partnerships, spinoffs, mergers, anything.  Seeing jumps or drops in stock price history can hint about what time frame in which those events occurred.

Then I take a gander at the competition.

After that, I look at leadership.  You need to know about the people calling the shots, because they determine whether the company is successful, stagnant, or failing.  They determine the vision, direction, and path to their goals.  A company with a great product, lots of profit, tons of assets, and little debt doesn't mean shit to me if their *new* CEO is SuckBob FuckPants.  Bad leaders can tank good companies.

Conversely, good leadership can save failing companies. 

So find out who's calling the shots, who the CEO is, CTO or whatever, head of research, anyone.  Their career history, the track records of previous companies they've worked for (did they save something or tank it, or just meh?), where they went to school, etc.  It doesn't have to be FBI-class dossiers, but you should be able to name names and say ""They did such and such at X company before, and now they're at Y and building/doing an even better version!""

Fight your own confirmation bias.  Look for potential obstacles for that company, and give them real consideration.  This is why I stick to things that I know - I'll already be familiar with industry trends and common obstacles.  By doing this, I can skip writing many pages about obstacles.

The reason to do any DD is to inform yourself, but it helps me to pretend like I'm writing for a group of serious investors.  Once you've read, summarized, sorted and collated all of the relevant info and have a nice 5-pager, you can take a day off, then read the whole thing over again with a clear head.

And have fun.  I'm weird, but DD is hella fun for me.  I have no idea why.",runningAndJumping22,1,/r/stocks/comments/md2wih/how_to_do_proper_dd/gs7s0x5/,0.082,0.76,0.157,0.9908

976,ID," > It's not like Revolut or their broker will go out of their way and inform every single government for every single share that somebody buys.

Yes, they do. That's the whole point of collecting all new user's data like their tax ID, etc.

At the end of the year, all brokers are required to report to the government how much every single user gained or lost on their platform throughout the year.

So they absolutely would report that your brother had an $800 profit.

If your brother did not claim that on his taxes, it *may* flag something in some database and they may decide to audit him to find out why they have a record saying he earned profits but he never claimed it on his taxes.

At the very lowest, it looks like the minimum would be 10%, so he'd owe at least $80 in taxes. He should probably just claim it and pay it, rather than risk them auditing him and fining him even more for not reporting it.

But HE has to go to them and nobody is forcing him, I'm guessing that if he doesn't go he'll be commiting tax evasion as they call it, but I don't see how it's regulated since there's no way for them to find out that he bought 2 shares in the first place",FlintXD,0,/r/stocks/comments/mcw5fd/how_do_taxes_tie_into_buying_stocks/gs5ti66/,0.025,0.855,0.12,0.8641
