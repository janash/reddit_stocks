61,GME," Just going to play a little devils advocate here, so don’t bring out the pitch forks on me here. Although GME was the center for this madness, and it should be about $15 give or take given its current state, I do think the potential bullish outlook is building. Key word there being potential. Definitely much riskier until the financials improve, and new roadmap actually starts coming to fruition a bit. But with Ryan Cohen leading the charge (one of the better entrepreneurs of this generation), and the high powered team they are building to attempt the business model transition, I do think they deserve a bit more credit right now. Again, do not twist this as me saying they should be like a $60 stock or even higher. I think about $15 is fair given the value adds of their recent extremely strong senior hires. Now they need to prove they can start making the transition successfully before another leg up is warranted. I just am a bit more keen on what I am seeing, and not necessarily in agreement at all with people who still just think they aren’t doin absolutely anything, and are still just a dying brick and mortar console store.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-02/mudrick-capital-gains-200-million-on-amc-gamestop-in-wild-week

The WSB narrative is a severely hyberbolic version of whats actually going on here. WSB way underestimates whales. Only reason I'm cued in to this is because I've been investing for over a decade, and then had an expensive crash course in market manipulation by jumping into blockchain stuff for the past 4 years. Ended up with significant gains, but only after a couple of years of visiting Baphomet in the frozen valley of not having sensible limit orders. Don't be me, Reddit, learn how to set aside euphoria and hype when you're gambling with your future. Sometimes diamond hands drag you to mildly nightmarish parallel realities, hopefully just temporarily.

I made a relevant gilded post about general money management and portfolio distribution after seeing people chasing Doge gains hard while others shilled the hell out of it if anyone needs direction, and cares to check my post history. It's legitimately concerning and disturbing seeing people post stuff like ""I didnt re-enroll this semester and put all my tuition money on DOGE 🚀🚀🚀💎👐"". That was seriously a post minus the emojis. Another person posted all-in with 60k, and a screenshots of their *Robinhood account where you can't even withdraw your coins into a secure wallet from*. All of the Doge hype was completely spillover from they meme stocks hype combined with Musk's tweets.

I know most of the time people with more experience are more likely to not have the time to bother, or just lurk, but I think the people in the room who have seen major losses before need to sober up as many of these people ""investing"" (gambling) on desperation and hail Mary's as possible.

Ford Motor Co. plans to use Google's Android operating system to power its vehicle display screens starting in 2023, the latest auto maker to tap Silicon Valley amid the accelerating digitization of the car business. 

The Dearborn, Mich.-based car company said Monday it has entered into a six-year agreement with the tech giant to embed Google's suite of apps, including voice commands and navigation, in multimedia displays on all Ford models outside of China. 

Ford also plans to involve Alphabet Inc.'s Google for cloud services to help the auto maker develop in-car features and manage the reams of data streaming from its vehicles. The computing service will also be used to organize production. 

Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed. 

Silicon Valley firms are pushing further into the auto business, eager to capitalize on the growth prospects of the car's evolution as a rolling personal device. Tech companies now provide core operating systems to run in-vehicle multimedia systems, while also providing cloud-based service to store and manage the proliferation of data produced by cars, many of which now are sold with broadband connections. 

Ford's eventual move to Google's Android system will be a hit to BlackBerry Ltd., which for years has provided its QNX operating system for Ford's vehicles. BlackBerry didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Other auto makers, including Volvo Cars and Ford rival General Motors Co., have in recent years chosen Google's Android system to deliver navigation, voice commands and other services in its cars. 

Google, the No. 3 cloud provider in the U.S., has been stepping up its efforts to overtake its rivals. 

The car industry is one of several markets where Google, Microsoft Corp, and Amazon.com Inc. are aggressively pushing their cloud-computing business, in which they rent server capacity and software tools to customers. 

Microsoft has already struck deals to provide its Azure cloud service to some of the world's largest car companies, including GM and Volkswagen AG. Amazon's AWS cloud business works with Toyota Motor Corp. and other auto makers. 

The increasing role of technology in cars also is becoming a source of friction between car makers and tech companies in the battle to capture the potential billions of dollars from ads and services that could flow through such systems. 

Ford said it will use Google's cloud services for everything from flagging potential new service offerings to managing equipment on the factory floor and streamlining supply chains. The companies said they will jointly staff a group to work on collaborative projects. 

The Google agreement comes after Ford has created its own facilities in Michigan to store and process data, including a $200 million investment disclosed in 2017. Those data centers will continue to operate, a Ford spokeswoman said. 

Inside the car, both Google and Apple Inc. have for years been offering dashboard features that mimic the look and feel of their ubiquitous operating systems. Apple also has been working secretively on its own car project for many years. Amazon's Alexa personal assistant is featured across many models. 

While most car makers offer so-called mirroring software to replicate the Android or Apple interfaces on the car's display, those features require drivers to connect their smartphones to the vehicle. Ford, GM and others are now working with Google to offer Android as built-in software, a move that allows owners to download apps directly to their vehicle's tabletlike display, said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at consultancy Guidehouse Insights. 

Auto makers are mobilizing to offer in-car services to customers that would allow the companies to collect recurring revenue streams and update features on the fly, from automated-driving features to new apps. They also are using data from vehicles to develop features for future models. 

Traditional car companies have struggled to offer infotainment systems and apps that car owners embrace as much as they do their smartphones. They also are grappling with how to capture, interpret and monetize the growing amount of vehicle-generated data. 

David McClelland, Ford's vice president of strategy and partnerships, said the Google system will allow Ford to offer customized features and services that would be different from those of its competitors.

Auto makers are mobilizing to offer in-car services to customers that would allow the companies to collect recurring revenue streams and update features on the fly, from automated-driving features to new apps. They also are using data from vehicles to develop features for future models. 

Traditional car companies have struggled to offer infotainment systems and apps that car owners embrace as much as they do their smartphones. They also are grappling with how to capture, interpret and monetize the growing amount of vehicle-generated data. 

David McClelland, Ford's vice president of strategy and partnerships, said the Google system will allow Ford to offer customized features and services that would be different from those of its competitors.

Everyone seemed to understand that retail investors needed to buy GME in order to push for a short squeeze. Obviously everyone’s best chance of soaking up shares was to stay driven and committed towards GME but then everyone freaked and decided to buy into other meme stocks that were obvious pump and dump stonks. Nearly all of them had already been pumped and dumped before the real hype. I don’t get it, I think that certainly effected GME downfall, certainly not nearly in the way the restrictions did.

394,DD," It was mentioned already to just pay attention to the world around you. Don't forget the real world DD, it'll come naturally at some point to think about things in a certain way. Have you used a product, that you like? Do many other people like it? Are others maybe not aware yet that it is a great product?

When I was playing Witcher 3, I thought it was one of the best games ever made and so did others, so I did some research on the developer, knew that cyberpunk is already in the pipeline and bought the stock in 2016, sold last year.

Years ago I was strolling through the city and saw a dominos delivery robot. pretty cute to be honest. I thought ""cool, they are trying things out on the tech site as well"", besides they had just bought out another pizza chain, it is all over the world and i actually like it better than other delivery pizzas.

First time I had a beyond burger, I was looking up if they are traded, they were not, but I was sure that i will be investing on ipo day.

and so on, and so on.... i was lucky with example 2 and 3 that i live in a larger city in Germany, where they tested the robots and where restaurants tested beyond burgers.

But you'll come across great products from your everyday life, and if you like anything particular, something new food wise, new pair of shoes, new game, new mouse or monitor, anything related to your hobbies... do some research on the company and if it checks ought alright, invest.

396,DD," I see a lot of recommendations about investing in ETF’s.  They aren’t wrong.

The case for this route: Great way to diversify for a low fee in the case of passive funds.  Relatively risk free and limited DD required on your part.

The case against: Many passive funds give below or average returns, although some do give exceptional returns (particularly with respect to actively managed funds).  Passive funds will track a crash downwards, whereas an actively managed fund will at least try to mitigate the loss (but the fees are higher as a result).

That said...  here’s a controversial opinion!

Micheal Saylor - love him or hate him - said something along the lines of, invest with the winners. By investing in an ETF, then by definition, you’re also investing in the losers of the market. 

So if you’re young, stupid and brave...!  ...then you might give consideration to trying to pick the winners. Higher risk means higher rewards.   But seriously, this is a very high risk approach depending on what you pick.

This is how I do it (rightly or wrongly - but it’s served me well):

1. Only invest in your interests. You are more likely to understand the sector better, more likely to put in the time and do the reading, watching, keeping informed, engaging in debate, etc if it doesn’t feel like a chore. 
2. Don’t disregard opinions that disagree with your view. They can be insightful and may cover gaps in your thinking thar might make you assess the level of risk a different way. 
3. Look at the macro view. Where is the world / sector going?
4. Zoom in a bit and look at the micro view. Which companies / part of the supply chain are most likely to succeed.
5. Keep an eye on your picks day by day as opposed to just leaving them like you would an ETF.  Laws and political environments can change daily. 

By way of an example. 

Macro view: I believe that the world will move to green energy - electric cars, hydrogen, etc. 

Micro view: I could buy a company focussing on wind power. But I won’t. Because that’s only one company competing for market share. I want the most benefit and to reduce my risk. What is absolutely guaranteed to win? Going through the supply chain, all of these organisations have the same inputs. Copper and platinum.  Mining is generally risky. But there are companies that reprocess mine dumps to extract the residual metals. This is less risky. Find a company that is showing progress, watch director interviews, read share forums to gauge existing investor sentiment, etc. 

Et voila. Risk managed. Positioned for growth. RETURNS STILL NOT GUARANTEED!  ...shit happens!",btwnastonknahardplce,13,/r/stocks/comments/ld3cqc/how_do_you_guys_make_a_dd/gm4q7ez/,0.089,0.77,0.141,0.983

400,DD," I forgot where I read this from but there seems to be two major sides of people who do DD. There are the analytical side and the financial side. Ideally you would combine both but it seems that those are the two biggest sides for people to determine if a company is worth purchasing stock in or not.

The analytical side usually looks at graphs, try to see the candles, order books, etc and use the trend-lines as their analysis for when it is good to make a purchase and use that to determine their price target.

The financial side usually looks at the financial reports, paying high attention to debt, revenue, earnings, etc.

Ideally you would combine the two but I've noticed most people usually put more weight on one than the other. In the end of the day, no stock is perfect, you just have to use the tools you have to determine which you feel comfortable getting into.

If you're a low risk type of person, you don't really need to do much DD. Easiest strategy is a dollar cost average into an index fund every month. VOO is a good one. Or pick some blue chip companies, sector diversified, that pay dividends. Buy and hold.

If you're wanting to take some risks then you'll need some DD. I'm interested in future tech a lot, so I end up reading about new tech or ideas coming along. Then I'll look for companies doing business in that sector. You want to look for cash on the balance sheet. Not too much debt. Growth opportunities. Business plans. Management team experience.

432,CEO," Disclaimer: I just posted my own list, and my own research. Everyone has a different opinion and thought process in investing. 

No its not about revenge

Most CEOs don't like short sellers. They do a huge amount of research and often find the problems that can change the stock price, trigger law suits or create a lot of questions. However most good CEOs accept that they are part of the game and know that when the business is sound and improves short sellers won't be a concern over the long run. They might influence the stock price in the short term but I have yet to find an example where are business was ruined due to short sellers and not due to their own problems.

I only want to invest in companies where the CEO focuses on the long run not just the next quarter or the stock price.

I have done a lot of research into frauds or financial sheenanigans. Most of them have in common that they focus a huge amount on the stock price instead of on the business. As a result these CEOS absolutly despise short sellers and voice that opinion publicly.

Now just because a CEO voices that he doesnt like short sellers doesn't mean that there are financial sheenanigans going on, but it shows that the CEO is more concerned about the stock price than the business, which for me is a red flag.",RoPrime12,16,/r/stocks/comments/ld3cqc/how_do_you_guys_make_a_dd/gm3us4x/,0.094,0.844,0.062,-0.9007

468,GME," It's worth pointing out that ""realizing a loss"" and the concept of realization has its own tax implications, as losses/gains in stock value aren't factored into your net income until you realize them by selling for less/more than the original purchase price.

So if you're stuck holding a pile of GME that you bought in at $480, and you're thinking of selling now, it might be worth considering the tax implications you would have right now in the current tax cycle, versus waiting and selling it later in the next tax cycle when you might be able to sell some other stocks at a gain (factoring in whether the stock might gain value during that time), and thereby realize the loss you took on GME to reduce/offset your net taxable income. 

Alternatively, selling now (or really, yesterday) to stop losses would realize the losses for you, but because of limits on the total amount of net capital loss deductions, it might be worth selling some other stocks at a gain to take advantage of the loss immediately. *Edited for accuracy: though I should ought to mention the effect of capital loss carryover under section 1211, which will allow capital losses to offset up to $3k of ordinary income a year and the rest to carry over. Capital loss carryover means that it often isn't worth seeing a stock zero out in value. It may also be worth looking to see if there are short-term gains worth offsetting in advance.*

It's important to treat realized gains and losses in a tax context separately from actual gains and losses in a general financial sense. “You only *realize* a loss when you sell” is an accurate statement, as long as you’re talking about taxes.",GrassWaterDirtHorse,217,/r/stocks/comments/lcsiia/cant_lose_money_if_i_dont_sell_myth_explained/gm24nkf/,0.108,0.744,0.149,0.8906
469,GME," Thats the Reason I had to sell my GME. I held because I was actually dumb enough to care about “making a change” but i saw that my portfolio was down by a lot because of BANG meme stocks and right now in missing on other opportunities. I have to admit that I have no evidence, but all my stock picks that i researched and chose by myself are doing good as expected which means that Im learning. Too bad i didn’t profit because sold them to join the meme stocks, which was another good decision until I (me, no one else, no one made me) decided to hold on the way down. Now i Know this is about money, not ideals. Having Ideals gets expensive and Im still poor. I will worry about that when I can do something about it.

I think that something else that might be good to go along with this is an explanation of expected value over time. I come from playing a lot of poker so EV is used a lot to decide whether a position should be held (bet) or sold (folded).

Is this something that you think goes in a fundmentals post at some point?

508,GME," Very well explained. I've been interested in learning about the stock market and investing for years. I admit that the recent events with GME were what finally spurred me to start learning. That said, I think anyone with even a dash of common sense will realize very quickly that wsb is *not* the place to learn or receive sound advice. There are definitely some knowledgeable people there, but for the most part it's an echo chamber and a self-aware joke sub.

So, I still sub there, if only to see an alternate perspective and for some laughs. Any real learning comes from legitimate sources outside of reddit, as well as the more serious subs (like this one). I'm in this for long term financial security, not riding the latest meme stock. That said, I will hold my one share of GME, because I bought in low with money I can afford to lose. If it goes back up great, if it doesn't, no harm to me. In the meantime I've been researching smarter long-term investments in the marijuana, energy, and tech sectors.

Second, people rarely win or hit a home run on their first try at anything. In my opinion failing or losing and learning from it is the best way to get better at something.

You know it's been hyped up too high and it's clear that it's going to fall back down to it's proper value in the next week or so.  That level is somewhere between $2 and $4.  But let's be charitable and say it's heading down to $4 where it sits for a few months.  So you could sell today at $8x2 = $16.  You could then wait for a week and spend your $16 when it hits $4.  You would buy 4 shares for that price.  Twice as many!

GME literally suffered a short squeeze so strong that if brokers had not run out of shares to disperse, it could've tanked the stock market, and then it rose back up to nearly the same price again following a multi-angled attempt by the media, hedge funds and brokers to keep the price down.

History was already made, it's most likely not going to happen again. Certain things would need to go a stars-aligning level of perfect for it to happen a third time, I just seriously doubt it. The price is already back down in the $40s aftermarket. Even if it does squeeze again, it won't be as strong as the first two and the whole thing will still ultimately be a terrible stock market strategy.

Anyone with significant holdings should have been selling off shares in intervals as the stock declined simply on smart investment principles. You need to preserve capital and manage risk at the end of the day, the key is getting those people to buy back in on another momentum wave at some point in the future. Could be days, could be months from now hard to say but like I said I truly don't believe the underlying short positions that made everything possible have changed drastically.

This is not on DFV, it’s on everyone who couldn’t see he already won the game no matter how many shares he still had in the game. It’s like being at a slot machine and winning big, then taking that big money ticket win and putting it into your pocket then putting a $20 bill into the machine to keep playing.

632,BB," Thanks for sharing this.  I especially like the survey of manufacturers and the approach.

Unfortunately I'm not sure of the factual accuracy of some of these points.

First, as to QNX.  It is first and foremost a microkernel-based real-time operating system.  It provides a POSIX userland which is where the ""Unix-like"" bit comes in.  Linux, on the other hand, is a monolithic general-purpose operating system.  ""Linux instead of Unix"" therefore doesn't even make sense as a statement in this context.

I've gotten that floppy demo before.  See if you can get your hands on it.  It had a GUI, including Web browser and other fancy things.  Very impressive.  By that point the Linux *kernel* would barely fit on a floppy, IIRC.

Focusing on whose infotainment system people like the UI of seems like a red herring here.

QNX would let you build the vehicle operation and the entertainment on the same platform, even the same hardware (though you might still want to isolate them).  Or you could use QNX or something else suitable for critical systems and Linux/Android for irrelevant bits.  I don't know that you'd want to use Linux for the brakes without lots of extra hardening, testing, and certification.

From what I heard Tesla uses Ubuntu and their remote management is apparently cobbled together and about to fall over.  That sounds insane so it could be baseless libel, but I've heard it from several independent supposed former Tesla employees.

Are you familiar with, e.g., MISRA when discussing automotive applications?

Then, critical/validated systems have many extra process requirements people don't think about when doing random consumer software (I argue they should, but that's a discussion for another time).  Many find them overwhelming, but in all honesty the standards I've seen (general and medical) are fairly flexible, only making you state at each step why you think the thing will actually work.  That doesn't seem like an unfair imposition.

As for ""ditching QNX for Android"", I think I saw a note the other day that Google and BlackBerry are collaborating on Android/QNX, specifically for auto applications.  Regarding Ford specifically, someone pointed out they hired hundreds of QNX engineers, haven't fired them, and may still be hiring.  Granted they could be indecisive and sloppy, but that's a big investment.

Don't have links handy since I'm in a hurry but feel free to look into those (and feel free to amend/correct).

I'm long BB but I'm also bullish on quality engineering and proper classification.  I also like QNX but just from what I've read and played with; haven't developed on/for it.  Free software is preferable --- especially, I believe, for safety-critical applications --- but I don't know of solid free software or open source real-time operating systems.

Not surprising the big companies are moving away from the products BB offers in the cyber realm as they are foundational and pervasive in their scope. In other words, once they get in a product stream they will probably be difficult to remove / replace. Major companies realize this and thus want to limit their exposure to the cost risks associated with relying on a third party vendor. The problem I see is even tech companies have a hard time dealing with tech. How likely is it that a someplace like GM, a notoriously backward looking company, is going to able to build a fast, scalable, secure, cyber platform for their products and keep it up to date? Maybe they can, maybe the cant, but its a pretty valid question and holds for many companies, large and small.

Additionally, this is exactly one market (automobiles). The intent behind the BB cyber suite it to provide a comprehensive, tailorable, scalable set of tools for anyone that makes a product. You want to make a toothbrush with bluetooth? Are you going to create a set of cyber tools from scratch to protect it? Or is it more likely you'd just buy an off the shelf product?

Still surprising how much it affected me when I still came out with a good profit. Live and learn.   


GME was a different beast, most stocks don't have the volatility to lose so much in such a short time span. I keep having to remind myself that. In that case I needed to act safer, but that will not always be the case.

847,DD," #  What I learned from $GME as a first time investor

When   I saw how many people were hyping $GME I thought that this just   couldn't go wrong. I never bought any stock before but I didn't want to   miss out on what seemed like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and so I   invested 600$ just before the hype started. When GME kept rising and   rising everyday I invested 600$ more. At the tip of the chart my depot   was worth around 10 500$ in total with an initial investment of 1200$.   As the chart kept going down and down I still didn't accept the fact   that it was over. I just now closed out my positions with a net gain of   200$ instead of almost 10 000$. I am a 19 year old high school senior,   this would've been a lot of money for me. But I was too greedy. I was   caught up in the hype and believed in the short squeeze. In retrospect   it was stupid for me to believe a few kids on the internet could beat   billionaire hedgefunds who've been in this game their whole lives. Maybe   I can save someone else these troubles - so here's what I learned.

# 1. In the stock market it's you versus everyone else so don't get caught up in mob mentality.

It   was a big mistake for me to believe in the David VS Goliath story. I   believed in this being a ""movement"" and wanted to hit the billionaires   where it hurt them. It was us against the world, I saw myself as a part   of a collective. Even after we peaked I still saw all the people  writing  ""diamond hands!!!"" and so I held my shares too. Don't do this.  It's you  against everyone else. The people who cashed out at the tip  may have  been called paperhands by everone else on wallstreetbets but  they took a  profit. We, the ones who held, are the idiots, not them.

# 2. Think of an exit plan when you invest and stick to it.

When   I invested into $GME I had no idea when I would exit. I basically only   relied on what I read on wallstreetbets and that was the herd  mentality  of holding until the bitter end. If I made an earlier plan of  exiting  at, say 200$ I would've still made more profits than I made  now. I also  read this from many other people who originally had an exit  plan but  kept raising it because of the memes. Before you invest think  of exactly  what you want and then stick to it. Exit earlier if you  think your goal  will not be reached but don't be greedy and keep  raising and raising  the bar. Nobody ever went broke taking a profit.

# 3. Your profits are only profits as soon as you cash out and actually have the money on your bank account.

As   soon as my depot was up it's first few hundred percent and I had a few   thousand bucks in it I started thinking about all the things I could  buy  with the money. I went on websites and filled my shopping cart with   some stuff I would've bought once I closed my positions. I basically   thought that the money was already mine but that's not how it works. The   worth of your position means absolutely nothing in terms of real-world   money so don't think about it as such. You can still lose all of it.  The  money is only yours as soon as you decide to sell your shares and   actually have the money in your bank account. You can think about all   the nice things you're going to buy as soon as you reach that point.   Otherwise you'll just get all your hopes destroyed.

# 4. Don't think you can beat Wall Street.

The   squeeze would probably have happened if it weren't for hedgefund   billionaires using their connections to flood our subreddits, manipulate   the media and even get brokers to restrict trading of certain stocks.   These people are the 1% and they are simply too powerful to win against   them. Especially if you're just part of some internet forum full of   middle and lower class investors who have no idea about the stock market   for the most part. Rich people can get away with anything they want   because they are rich and this will never change. Don't think you can   beat them because you can't.

# 5. Remove yourself from echo-chambers and listen to other opinions too.

As   already mentioned my biggest mistake was listening to people on   wallstreetbets. The daily $GME threads were an absolute   confirmation-bias filled echo chamber. Everybody kept firing themselves   up, people who were talking about selling were immediately downvoted to   oblivion. I also participated in this. Don't let it get this far. Get   your information from other sources too. Echo-chambers are extremely   dangerous, not only in this context but in general. I have already   unsubscribed from wallstreetbets.

Those   are probably my main five takeaways from all of this. I am just glad I   didn't indebt myself for this. There were enough people who took   mortgages or credits just to invest the money into this stock. I'm glad   I'm not one of them. In the end I still took a small profit, even if I   could have had taken a much bigger one if I would've been a bit more   rational. Still the lessons I learned from this are probably more   valuable than the money I could've made with this trade. At least that's   what I want to believe.

I don't   really know how I'll continue on from here, if I should keep investing   or leave it be. I learned many things about the stock market from this   but in reality I'm still an absolute beginner. I have no idea how to do   my own DD, I have no idea how I should set price expectations for  stocks  I want to invest in. For now I have transferred the money from  my  brokerage to my savings account and I'll think about where to go  from  here. I could definitely use some extra money for university,  right now I  have about 6000$ in savings but I don't want to gamble  anything away by  believing in quick or safe, easy money.

I   hope this can provide some sort of value for people who are in the  same  boat as I was two weeks ago and that this can prevent other  beginners  from making the same mistakes I did. I learned my lesson so  others  hopefully won't have to. I'm still happy because it could've  gone a lot  worse.

Also feel free  to discuss  my points in the comments here, I'm very interested in what  more  seasoned investors have to think about this or if I'm wrong in  some  aspects. These are only the conclusions I reached regarding my  personal  experiences.",doktorpopscherl,6,/r/stocks/comments/ld2i70/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_feb/gm4tk2f/,0.071,0.808,0.12,0.9971
848,GME," #  What I learned from $GME as a first time investor

When   I saw how many people were hyping $GME I thought that this just   couldn't go wrong. I never bought any stock before but I didn't want to   miss out on what seemed like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and so I   invested 600$ just before the hype started. When GME kept rising and   rising everyday I invested 600$ more. At the tip of the chart my depot   was worth around 10 500$ in total with an initial investment of 1200$.   As the chart kept going down and down I still didn't accept the fact   that it was over. I just now closed out my positions with a net gain of   200$ instead of almost 10 000$. I am a 19 year old high school senior,   this would've been a lot of money for me. But I was too greedy. I was   caught up in the hype and believed in the short squeeze. In retrospect   it was stupid for me to believe a few kids on the internet could beat   billionaire hedgefunds who've been in this game their whole lives. Maybe   I can save someone else these troubles - so here's what I learned.

# 1. In the stock market it's you versus everyone else so don't get caught up in mob mentality.

It   was a big mistake for me to believe in the David VS Goliath story. I   believed in this being a ""movement"" and wanted to hit the billionaires   where it hurt them. It was us against the world, I saw myself as a part   of a collective. Even after we peaked I still saw all the people  writing  ""diamond hands!!!"" and so I held my shares too. Don't do this.  It's you  against everyone else. The people who cashed out at the tip  may have  been called paperhands by everone else on wallstreetbets but  they took a  profit. We, the ones who held, are the idiots, not them.

# 2. Think of an exit plan when you invest and stick to it.

When   I invested into $GME I had no idea when I would exit. I basically only   relied on what I read on wallstreetbets and that was the herd  mentality  of holding until the bitter end. If I made an earlier plan of  exiting  at, say 200$ I would've still made more profits than I made  now. I also  read this from many other people who originally had an exit  plan but  kept raising it because of the memes. Before you invest think  of exactly  what you want and then stick to it. Exit earlier if you  think your goal  will not be reached but don't be greedy and keep  raising and raising  the bar. Nobody ever went broke taking a profit.

# 3. Your profits are only profits as soon as you cash out and actually have the money on your bank account.

As   soon as my depot was up it's first few hundred percent and I had a few   thousand bucks in it I started thinking about all the things I could  buy  with the money. I went on websites and filled my shopping cart with   some stuff I would've bought once I closed my positions. I basically   thought that the money was already mine but that's not how it works. The   worth of your position means absolutely nothing in terms of real-world   money so don't think about it as such. You can still lose all of it.  The  money is only yours as soon as you decide to sell your shares and   actually have the money in your bank account. You can think about all   the nice things you're going to buy as soon as you reach that point.   Otherwise you'll just get all your hopes destroyed.

# 4. Don't think you can beat Wall Street.

The   squeeze would probably have happened if it weren't for hedgefund   billionaires using their connections to flood our subreddits, manipulate   the media and even get brokers to restrict trading of certain stocks.   These people are the 1% and they are simply too powerful to win against   them. Especially if you're just part of some internet forum full of   middle and lower class investors who have no idea about the stock market   for the most part. Rich people can get away with anything they want   because they are rich and this will never change. Don't think you can   beat them because you can't.

# 5. Remove yourself from echo-chambers and listen to other opinions too.

As   already mentioned my biggest mistake was listening to people on   wallstreetbets. The daily $GME threads were an absolute   confirmation-bias filled echo chamber.

I'm curious why you think this is true.  It's almost certainly the opposite.  Yes, maybe it's more likely that you do the betting through separate streaming apps, but fubo has a **very** tough road ahead of it because:

&nbsp;

a) **It knows absolutely nothing about gambling.**  Yes they bought Vigtory (a company without a product and with single-digit employees) but hardly anyone working at fubo even gambles, nevermind has experience in creating gambling experiences.  People at fubo know about marketing, moving video files around, and building mostly-not-shitty user experiences on top of an industry backend (basically all major TV players) that is in a tragically antiquated state.  

&nbsp;

b) **The first mover advantage is immense, and fubo doesn't have it.**.  The DFS companies and a small group of other competitors are in a much more advanced state with respect to their ability to understand and technologically grapple with the variety of regulation out there.

&nbsp;

The sports betting technology problem is essentially a payments/identity problem at this point.  The really hard part is figuring out how to connect all of the financial plumbing in a way that's compliant with the extremely complicated regulatory environment.  I think in the next 3-5 years we'll start to see today's major players start to operate their payments infrastructure as platforms, allowing developers to integrate a betting experience into their apps.  There is no way fubo is going to win this particular race, the others are much too far ahead -- in fact it's more likely their best option would be to adopt these new platforms too, leaving fubo as at best the equivalent of a successful amazon seller, not an industry leader.

&nbsp;

c) **Its core business isn't profitable.** Fubo has essentially gone public then decided to use the proceeds to go start another startup in a completely different industry.  That's just a little strange to begin with, but probably fine as long as fubo continues to have rich benefactors and the stock maintains cult popularity.  Without an actually profitable business to fall back on, however, when the music stops the curtain will come back to reveal not all that much of value.

&nbsp;

Their subscriber base is small, and while sub growth might take a bend a bit higher, but my guess is that it remains mostly linear for the foreseeable future.

I like fubo, and have used it for over 3 years now on pretty much every platform they support.

961,FUBO," To get most of the sports channels FUBO offers you'd almost certainly need several add on packages that sends the total price way over 60/month.  On Fubo you can also do the following: watch any shows from the last 72 hours without taking up recording space. Let's say you missed an NBA game yesterday and want to turn it on today, just go back and find it. When you start recording a show but it's already halfway through, it still records from the beginning on FUBO. With cable it only records from when you press the record button. You can also have two channels playing on the same screen at once, not something I'd want but for some insane sports fans it's probably nice. Also, they are working on integrating sports betting directly into the platform.

Plus: no cords/cable boxes and constantly dealing with cable/cable company issues.

So basically, it's not revolutionary just ""better"". Same with Roku to be honest. They weren't doing anything completely new, there were other streaming platforms out there when they started growing.

Also, as for your comment about internet: let's face it, most people already require high speed internet and within the next 10 years it will become as normal and required as having electric in a home.

I'd equate what they are trying to do as taking the casino sportsbook room, with its readily available betting, multiple screens, live odds, etc. and giving you control over it, putting it on your home tv, and modernizing the available data with live widgets, tips, probabilities etc. I think this will be the new standard for sports betting and sports watching.

967,SR," >Sounds like we may be in agreement that type of integrated sports watching & gambling product is the future of the industry but disagree with which side of that to have as your bread and butter.

&nbsp;

Yes.  For reasons I didn't go into in the other post, I do think a ""good"" experience for this is probably at least 5 years out.

&nbsp;

> I agree the betting technology platform is a major hurdle but I see them going with a buy rather than build solution given their sportsbook's recent partnership with Sportradar/Betradar. This company handles legal stuff, analyzing data for the best odds, and even the technology to add gambler widgets to a live sports platform. There are actually quite a few sportsbooks who work with this company, including Penn and Draftkings so I'm guessing they help with some of these same technology platforms.

&nbsp;

I think you have the wrong impression of what the fubo/SportRadar partnership likely is.  Also they just bought Vigtory, which seems a pretty convincing move toward build.  Most likely SR is interested in including fubo's video within *its* apps, and as I said nobody in the industry (including SR) is in a position yet to offer a platform-type integration for fubo to leverage.  I would bet you that what fubo mostly gets out of this partnership is some kind of affiliate revenue for driving its customers to BetRadar.  Meh.

&nbsp;

> I see the live sports streaming as the greater hurdle primarily due to available games/leagues. If it is not already happening, I envision there will be exclusive contracts to be the official streaming sports book of the NFL/NBA/etc. Fubo has the first mover advantage here due to their existing relationships with premium leagues.

fubo barely has a sportsbook, and all of these companies have relationships with the leagues.  Fubo really doesn't have anything special here, never mind first-mover advantage.  

&nbsp;

>And from these league's viewpoint while companies like Draftkings may have an equal or larger user base, these are gamblers first sports watchers second. I would think they see more potential for % growth in number of eyeballs from gamblers coming to the existing sports tv platform that adds gambling, vs. sports watchers coming to the existing gambling platform that adds live sports.

&nbsp;

The leagues want a cut, not to expand eyeballs.  Even if the TAM grows into something a bit less mediocre, the money is going to be made from the platforms that actually move bets around.  OK so some gamblers might switch to fubo if they integrate gambling (the amazon seller model) but from the leagues point of view those people were already watching somewhere else -- there aren't any incremental eyeballs.  Their one hope is to somehow out-build the others in turning Vigtory into a market-leader with integrated fubo video.  Maybe there's a chance there, but it would require flawless execution.

It really depends. There are some stocks whereby I am able to tell myself to hold for years and ignore the short term movements and not take a single cent in profit (e.g NET avg $38 and MWK avg ~$20 after averaging up) because I absolutely trust the company to do well and is a market disruptor.

I buy 2500 shares ($10,000) of FNKO at $4
When stock is priced at a 25% gain I sell off $2500
If it goes up again another 25% I sell another 2500
I repeat this until all my $10,000 original investment is out and the remaining stocks I'm waiting for a peak price 
Then sell the entire position when I'm comfortable.

1000,EV," Im bullish on Ford for one reason and its not EV. 

The bronco. 

Its a segment that ford doesn't even currently have in their lineup, the rugged offroad jeep competitor. I think its gonna print money for them if they can ramp up production and get them on lots.

Jeeps are a cult like no other. People love them, there hasn't been anything else like them in a long time at the price point. Until now with the bronco. 

I think ford really knocked the bronco design out of the park. They made a vehicle true to its roots, and every bit as capable as a jeep. They also added even more brilliant features, and even look to have improved upon a lot of the little drawbacks of a jeep.

I've been in jeep forums a long time and let me tell you there are a lot of die hard jeep fans planning to make the switch to the bronco. There is also a die hard bronco following with 20 years of pent up demand. I also think they are going to pull a ton of new buyers into the segment. 

I've wanted a jeep for a few years, but steering issues, reliability issues, and general quirks have kept me on the sidelines. Chrysler never seems to get them all sorted out and its too much to pay for a vehicle to have constant issues. People say well its a jeep thing its how they are, but 50+ grand you shouldn't have to deal with that. This is where ford has another big opportunity.

I dont even like fords vehicle lineup, there isn't any vehicle they make I'd ever consider seriously buying. I've always been a gm truck guy, but I want a bronco, and I bet I'm not the only one.",xxPOOTYxx,1,/r/stocks/comments/lcxij9/thoughts_on_ford_moving_into_ev/gm367bj/,0.046,0.857,0.097,0.9489

Ford looks to be positioning themselves well there in EV particularly over the next few years, but even assuming they capitalize on some advantage there, the competition will catch up fast and that advantage will be gone just like pre-EV. 

Tesla is obviously an outlier thus far in terms of being able to break free of those competitive industry constraints due to their early EV focus and they may continue to at least somewhat be that outlier long term even as competition creeps closer.

No joke, stumbled upon it a couple days ago. Dropped $500 into it for shits and giggles and it is up 25% today alone. Checked out their website and they hold quite a few brands and have made some recent acquisitions as they try to push more into the US market (they're canadian).

And good news is that it's basically a penny stock at this point, so if it tanks for some reason, I'm only out $500, but if the trend continues, it might turn into a couple dollars within FY22.....and I'll see a fun little profit.

I'm not investing for a big payday or to game the system btw....I day trade just for fun (my day trade portfolio is like $2000 at any given time). My long term investments are all in managed mutual funds, Roth, Traditional IRA, and my 401k.

It gives me something to look at day to day opposed to playing some stupid phone game that plays ads every 30 secs.

I was also a bag holder on GME (2 shares at 220 that I picked up right before the RH shenanigans). I could've sold it at 300+ the next day, but was going for the whole ""hero or zero"" approach. Still holding those 2 shares as a reminder to watch out for momentum plays (and that if I'm hearing about it after a tick up, then I'm probably too late and I should check myself). But jumping into the game out of FOMO and going with 1 or 2 shares isn't a big deal. I'd never throw thousands of dollars at a single day trade purchase. Most I go is usually a couple hundred and let it play for a bit. When I see a decent profit (could be as low as 50 bucks), I sell and move onto something else.

1061,NVAX," NVAX is an older company and haven't managed to bring anything to the market so far, and their pipeline consists solemnly of vaccines. So when they actually managed to bring something (close) to the market their other potential products gained value, they showed that their undervaluation (based on previous unsuccessful vaccines) is not warranted. Moderna on the other hand has a wider range of pipeline with mRNA technology (cancer therapeutics for example), and since those would be more difficult to bring to the market, they are a bit more risky to invest in but with a higher reward. But their price hike was also quite considerable because they proved that their technology works at least in this indication.

**QQQM** \- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. QQQM is the ""new QQQ."" It is essentially the same ETF, but with a lower expense ratio. I don't know why more people are talking about it on here, but use this one instead of QQQ if you are a new investor. If you already have money in QQQ, I'd say keep using that one, because there isn't enough difference between the two to make it work paying taxes on selling QQQ to buy QQQM.

Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. Top holdings are: AAPL (12.5%), MSFT (9.5%), AMZN (8.7%), and TSLA (5.4%). Since it is heavily weighted on fewer stocks than some ETFs, it's performance is more dependent on these tech stocks. That said, these are pretty good stocks with a history of good performance. AAPL and AMZN have both had recent and significant price target increases from a number of brokers. The 52 week performance for QQQ is 45%, which is phenomenal for a broad market ETF.

**VOO**/**SPY** \- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&P 500 Index, the main difference being that VOO has a slightly lower expense ratio. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. Because there are 500 stocks and because there is more balance, this fund tends to be less volatile than QQQ. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VGT**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**. There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist. Top Holdings include: AAPL (6.7%), MSFT (5.3%), AMZN (4.3%), FB (2.8%) and TSLA (1.7%). The 52 week performance is a respectable 17%. I think the average over long periods of time is around 7% annually.

**VXUS** \- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas. I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future. The 52 week performance is 13%.

**VTV** \- The Vanguard Value Index Fund, as you mentioned, is a passively managed ETF tracking the CRSP US Large Cap Value Index. Top holdings in this one include BRK/B (2.9%), JNJ (2.8%), JPM (2.7%), PG (2.4%), UNH (2.3%). The 52 week return on VTV is 2.93%. Total returns including dividends is 4.06%. VTV has two goals: Dividend income and to reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs.

**LIT** \- Global Lithium Battery ETF. This is a sector ETF that is passively managed and follows a lithium production and manufacturing index. The 52 week performance is a whopping 110%.

**POTX** \- A cannibis ETF that invests at least 80% of its total assets in the securities of the underlying index and in American Depositary Receipts (""ADRs"") and Global Depositary Receipts (""GDRs"") based on the securities in the underlying index. The 52 week return is 26%, but I suspect a lot of people think that will be much higher this year.

(Note: I'm not a financial advisor or a financial expert)

Here is what I have proposed in the past, and I think it's a good strategy for ETF investing:

20% - Broad market ETF of your choice: **QQQM**, **VOO**, etc. I would avoid **VTV** if you are under age 40. It's a little too conservative for younger investors; the growth potential isn't there. If you are over age 40, you may want to split this portion of your allocation and put 10% into **QQQM** or **VOO** and 10% into **VTV**.

20% - **VXUS** \- I think it's a good idea to put some money into an emerging markets fund, and in my past research this one looks to be one of the better funds for this purpose.

20% - Small or Mid-cap market fund. Here is one you didn't mention. I think a broad market fund that focuses on either small-cap or mid-cap companies is a good idea for any portfolio, especially if you are under age 40. **IWM** is one of my favorites in this area. IWM is an passively managed index fund that tracks the Russell 2000 index, investing in 2000 small-cap companies in the US equity market.

10% into each of four sector funds of your choice. For example:

10% - LIT

10% - POTX

10% - ARKG

10% - PBW

This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas. I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future. The 52 week performance is 13%.

**VTV** \- The Vanguard Value Index Fund, as you mentioned, is a passively managed ETF tracking the CRSP US Large Cap Value Index. Top holdings in this one include BRK/B (2.9%), JNJ (2.8%), JPM (2.7%), PG (2.4%), UNH (2.3%). The 52 week return on VTV is 2.93%. Total returns including dividends is 4.06%. VTV has two goals: Dividend income and to reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs.

**LIT** \- Global Lithium Battery ETF. This is a sector ETF that is passively managed and follows a lithium production and manufacturing index. The 52 week performance is a whopping 110%.

**POTX** \- A cannibis ETF that invests at least 80% of its total assets in the securities of the underlying index and in American Depositary Receipts (""ADRs"") and Global Depositary Receipts (""GDRs"") based on the securities in the underlying index. The 52 week return is 26%, but I suspect a lot of people think that will be much higher this year.

(Note: I'm not a financial advisor or a financial expert)

Here is what I have proposed in the past, and I think it's a good strategy for ETF investing:

20% - Broad market ETF of your choice: **QQQM**, **VOO**, etc. I would avoid **VTV** if you are under age 40. It's a little too conservative for younger investors; the growth potential isn't there. If you are over age 40, you may want to split this portion of your allocation and put 10% into **QQQM** or **VOO** and 10% into **VTV**.

20% - **VXUS** \- I think it's a good idea to put some money into an emerging markets fund, and in my past research this one looks to be one of the better funds for this purpose.

20% - Small or Mid-cap market fund. Here is one you didn't mention. I think a broad market fund that focuses on either small-cap or mid-cap companies is a good idea for any portfolio, especially if you are under age 40. **IWM** is one of my favorites in this area. IWM is an passively managed index fund that tracks the Russell 2000 index, investing in 2000 small-cap companies in the US equity market.

10% into each of four sector funds of your choice. For example:

10% - LIT

10% - POTX

10% - ARKG

10% - PBW

**QQQM** \- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. QQQM is the ""new QQQ."" It is essentially the same ETF, but with a lower expense ratio. I don't know why more people are talking about it on here, but use this one instead of QQQ if you are a new investor. If you already have money in QQQ, I'd say keep using that one, because there isn't enough difference between the two to make it work paying taxes on selling QQQ to buy QQQM.

Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. Top holdings are: AAPL (12.5%), MSFT (9.5%), AMZN (8.7%), and TSLA (5.4%). Since it is heavily weighted on fewer stocks than some ETFs, it's performance is more dependent on these tech stocks. That said, these are pretty good stocks with a history of good performance. AAPL and AMZN have both had recent and significant price target increases from a number of brokers. The 52 week performance for QQQ is 45%, which is phenomenal for a broad market ETF.

**VOO**/**SPY** \- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&P 500 Index, the main difference being that VOO has a slightly lower expense ratio. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. Because there are 500 stocks and because there is more balance, this fund tends to be less volatile than QQQ. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VGT**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**. There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist. Top Holdings include: AAPL (6.7%), MSFT (5.3%), AMZN (4.3%), FB (2.8%) and TSLA (1.7%).

1086,TSLA," As my previous post was removed (I'm still not sure why), I'll make changes and try again....

**QQQM** \- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. QQQM is the ""new QQQ."" It is essentially the same ETF, but with a lower expense ratio. I don't know why more people are talking about it on here, but use this one instead of QQQ if you are a new investor. If you already have money in QQQ, I'd say keep using that one, because there isn't enough difference between the two to make it work paying taxes on selling QQQ to buy QQQM.

Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. Top holdings are: AAPL (12.5%), MSFT (9.5%), AMZN (8.7%), and TSLA (5.4%). Since it is heavily weighted on fewer stocks than some ETFs, it's performance is more dependent on these tech stocks. That said, these are pretty good stocks with a history of good performance. AAPL and AMZN have both had recent and significant price target increases from a number of brokers. The 52 week performance for QQQ is 45%, which is phenomenal for a broad market ETF.

**VOO**/**SPY** \- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&P 500 Index, the main difference being that VOO has a slightly lower expense ratio. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. Because there are 500 stocks and because there is more balance, this fund tends to be less volatile than QQQ. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VGT**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**. There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist. Top Holdings include: AAPL (6.7%), MSFT (5.3%), AMZN (4.3%), FB (2.8%) and TSLA (1.7%). The 52 week performance is a respectable 17%. I think the average over long periods of time is around 7% annually.

**VXUS** \- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas. I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future. The 52 week performance is 13%.

**VTV** \- The Vanguard Value Index Fund, as you mentioned, is a passively managed ETF tracking the CRSP US Large Cap Value Index. Top holdings in this one include BRK/B (2.9%), JNJ (2.8%), JPM (2.7%), PG (2.4%), UNH (2.3%). The 52 week return on VTV is 2.93%. Total returns including dividends is 4.06%. VTV has two goals: Dividend income and to reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs.

**LIT** \- Global Lithium Battery ETF. This is a sector ETF that is passively managed and follows a lithium production and manufacturing index. The 52 week performance is a whopping 110%.

**POTX** \- A cannibis ETF that invests at least 80% of its total assets in the securities of the underlying index and in American Depositary Receipts (""ADRs"") and Global Depositary Receipts (""GDRs"") based on the securities in the underlying index. The 52 week return is 26%, but I suspect a lot of people think that will be much higher this year.

(Note: I'm not a financial advisor or a financial expert)

Here is what I have proposed in the past, and I think it's a good strategy for ETF investing:

20% - Broad market ETF of your choice: **QQQM**, **VOO**, etc. I would avoid **VTV** if you are under age 40. It's a little too conservative for younger investors; the growth potential isn't there. If you are over age 40, you may want to split this portion of your allocation and put 10% into **QQQM** or **VOO** and 10% into **VTV**.

20% - **VXUS** \- I think it's a good idea to put some money into an emerging markets fund, and in my past research this one looks to be one of the better funds for this purpose.

20% - Small or Mid-cap market fund. Here is one you didn't mention. I think a broad market fund that focuses on either small-cap or mid-cap companies is a good idea for any portfolio, especially if you are under age 40. **IWM** is one of my favorites in this area. IWM is an passively managed index fund that tracks the Russell 2000 index, investing in 2000 small-cap companies in the US equity market.

10% into each of four sector funds of your choice. For example:

10% - LIT

10% - POTX

10% - ARKG

10% - PBW

As you say, earnings don't have as much pull.

1114,DASH," Here's the way I look at it.  There is a segment of the fitness community that loves gyms - mostly lifters who love to show off and pick up women.  They're going to rush back to the gyms when they open.  But they're also not PTON's market.

There's also a huge segment of people who actually don't like gyms but they go out of necessity, either for the equipment or for the social element of doing fitness classes.  PTON offers both in the convenience of your own home.  And it has such a strong community that people get hooked once they're in.  Everyone who owns a Peloton says it's the greatest thing they've ever bought.  People love the classes and follow instructors like they're celebrities.  And the fact that you can partake in this community through a digital sub, without having to lay out $1500 or whatever for a bike or treadmill, is a huge avenue for growth.  These customers aren't going to be rushing back to gyms if they can get what they want fitness-wise through Peloton at home.

This is very different, IMO, from food delivery and restaurants.  People love going to restaurants for the atmosphere, the quality of food, the menu options, etc, that you can't get in the same way through delivery.  That's why people will rush back to restaurants and why I think companies like DASH are doomed.

1172,AMC," You’re confusing multiple things. Borrowing shares aren’t like option contracts, they don’t expire. As long as they have the money to pay the collateral if the price goes up, they can hold indefinitely or just take the loss if they don’t think it’s worth risking keeping their money in the stock. AMC just did a large offering, that may bring the stock down even further than what it was before the run up, although the counter to that is they raided funds which may help them survive longer and keep the price a bit higher. Shorts are likely looking at that balance to weigh if they want to exit their positions or not.


What I think you’re confusing things with is the large run up GME had a few Fridays ago, where every call option that was issued that week expired above the target strike price because they didn’t anticipate how high the price would jump on Friday because of the short squeeze hype, at the same time, a lot of people bought calls that week, forcing the market makers who sold the calls to buy stock. This further drove the price up in what’s called a gamma squeeze. This has nothing to do with shorted shares other than the hype of it being the catalyst for the gamma squeeze. I don’t think there’s ever been a gamma squeeze anywhere near that dramatic before and the following Friday the Market markers were much better prepared for it, it was an extremely rare event.

This further drove the price up in what’s called a gamma squeeze. This has nothing to do with shorted shares other than the hype of it being the catalyst for the gamma squeeze. I don’t think there’s ever been a gamma squeeze anywhere near that dramatic before and the following Friday the Market markers were much better prepared for it, it was an extremely rare event.

1198,GME," Here's a little more - 

Don't believe in things just because people tell you to. I'm the kinda guy that is open to ideas but I don't like being told what to do.

As far as diversification, you need to ask what your goal or purpose of investing is, and answer this one with a clear mind. Post nut clarity can help. Once you know your purpose, write it down, and stick to it. 

Me? I like to gamble a little bit, a lot of times, but also want to be insulated from even heavy losses. So, I have 70% in stable investments that I hold long, and are reliable enough. REITs, blue chips, S&P companies, mining and metal, etfs, whatever. I then have 30% speculative stuff, a limit that, if I exceed, I'm not to buy any more speculative stuff without selling other speculatives. Among these, I like to throw it into a variety of different risky investments, never too much into one. I'd rather have 10 different gambles than one big one - increases my chances of finding a gem after all. (this strat let me get ÄLРР and currently ЕИZC). Sure maybe it was only $200 in, but those gains felt amazing. 

Don't be greedy and ignore all FOMO. Even if it's an investment you really believe in, if it's going crazy on Reddit and you're feeling fomo, set a 2 week reminder to buy it. You'll miss some rocketships but you'll keep your money and there's always another rocket on the way. 

Lastly, when you do find a 🚀, there's the matter of how you handle it. Most recently with GME, I just sold a little bit in a few stages, at $170, $260, and then the rest of it at $340 (after falling down from $400+ the first time). I then fomo'd a second spike so I bought a little at $200, and a little more today at $55. (entirely with house money, so if it goes tits up I still profit lol) It's really wonderful to be able to get to a point where you can play with only the house money, it removes any desperation or restrictions, and if you're lucky enough you'll even have spare house money for some other gambles too. Just remove a little bit at a time, use a trailing stop loss if you want. I've almost never managed to guess the peak, but having guaranteed +500% gain is better than risking it for something more. Going for +1000% would only double what I've already made (a lot sure), but I would feel the loss of the +500% a lot more than I'd feel the doubled gains, if that makes sense. 

I ain't paper handed on GME btw, I'm holding just as many shares as I started with. Just bought 'em back at a discount. In the case of GME, assuming there will be another spike, it makes more sense the Hedgies would push the price down a significant amount and take the interest hit for a few days, than do their covering at that pretty ridiculous $300 level. You can't expect all your investments to dip though, so it's case by case.

There is no evidence of naked short selling as of yet. GME is a $10 stock that was selling at $400, of course people were shorting this on the way up.

The reason so many beginners are crying illegal naked shorts is because they saw 140% short float and immediately thought, “That’s impossible! Why isn’t the SEC doing anything!?”

The SEC isn’t doing anything because being >100% short is entirely possible and NOT ILLEGAL.

Need proof? A owns 10 shares. B shorts and sells those. C buys those. D shorts and sells those. E buys those.

B and D are short 20. E owns 10. The short float is 200%. This is not naked short selling because they each shorted physical shares.

Should this be legal? Probably not. But it is.",TheGourmetHotDog,4,/r/stocks/comments/ldeu89/dd_on_naked_short_selling_failure_to_deliver_and/gm5hvit/,0.096,0.847,0.057,-0.8051
1213,GME," Congratulations on finding the definition of a bunch of terms that are popular to assume something illegal happened in GME.  However you do not seem to understand how they are related.  I am not saying naked short selling didn't happen but there is no way to know if it did and you are wrong in your assumption that it absolutely happened and that ""the SEC didn't do shit""

Here is an example of what can happen with a short.

A buys 1 share

B borrows that share and sells it to C

D borrows that same share from C and Sells it to E

There are now 3 longs and 2 shorts on the same share. This is how you get over 100% short interest.

At this point there hasn't even been a failed to deliver. 

The issues can start when A sells their share it isn't there it is just an IOU from their broker at which point their broker goes back to B's broker and says I need that share back you owe me because my guy just sold it. B's broker then needs to find someone else to borrow from like E. If E won't loan their share B's broker doesn't have one to give to A's broker and that is where the failed to deliver would come in.  

Naked shorting is when you sell short without borrowing the share but as you can see more than 100% short interest doesn't necessarily mean naked shorting occurred. The fact is that GME's float was over 200% shorted because a lot of the shares are not in public circulation and those wouldn't have been able to be borrowed.  This means there was actually on average over 2 shorts for every share  

The reason there are so many failure to delivers is because GME's average volume was over 200% of the float as well so people kept selling their shares that someone else borrowed, however the failure to deliver numbers were never even more than 2% of the float.  So yes the high volatility of the stock made it hard for brokers to keep locating shares to borrow to make the deliveries but that was not necessarily because of naked shorting.

If what you were implying was true that over 100% short interest was proof of naked shorting the failure to deliver numbers would have been over 40MM.",imnotgood42,1,/r/stocks/comments/ldeu89/dd_on_naked_short_selling_failure_to_deliver_and/gm5ibg0/,0.056,0.771,0.172,0.9937

A similar example is overstock.com which was on the list for 666 consecutive trading days in 2007. The SEC made no attempt to enforce close out, nor did it enforce the FOIA request to disclose specific institutional FTD rates.

Over and over, the SEC hides behind the market makers exception in the Reg SHO, and that allows shit like this to happen where you have a very likely case of naked shorting that you simply cannot not get any clarity on because the SEC won’t follow their own rules.",NotMyChairr,0,/r/stocks/comments/ldeu89/dd_on_naked_short_selling_failure_to_deliver_and/gm5pdk0/,0.072,0.844,0.083,0.0423

1284,DIS," The general advice I operate on is;

1. Define a new high (high volatility or not) 
2.  Is there a market reason for a peak that's not within the day to day expected swings (earnings, new contract, acquisition etc) 
3. Trailing trend, for me this is based on your own valuation - i.e is the yoy growth for example beating the market or is it a case worth investigating

If the price is literally just following the industry and its comparables, then buying in at this new ""high"" really isn't all too bad. But you should at this point expand your scope to some digging and research regarding the general trend of the industry.

An example recently might be the DIS hulu announcement, the price jumped 15 points that day. It is 1. A new high outside the expected volatility 2. The reason for the swing was an acquisition and price movement reflects speculation on synergies and sentiment more than other analysis 3. Removing that data point, DIS was already beating its comparables (but then again its DIS) 

So based on 1 and 2, I would not have bought in at this peak expecting speculation to correct itself. After it trends back to 170 I just ask my own questions again and decide if its a good purchase.

A good purchase here is w.e analysis you're comfortable with, fundamental, technical, oujia board. Honestly the market tracks sentiment and belief more than any model. It's a self fulfilling prophecy until quarterly reports lol. Personally if it's a long term hold I just focus on fundamentals if it's a 3 month play or even options a few months out then the greek letters might mean something but it's what you're comfortable with.
