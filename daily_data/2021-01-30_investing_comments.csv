0,GME," Why couldn't this go on for another 2 months? I know the short answer is that hedge funds pay out the ass in interest on short positions, but from some very basic math, it seems like the interest on the total 30B dollars worth of shorted GME stock, at %30, works out to \~200m per week to not close out short positions.

Why wouldn't they hold out few weeks/months, hoping that retail investors lose stamina/interest, or get cold feet and sell before then? It seems like the hundreds of millions in interest would be a reasonable last ditch effort, over closing out with multiple billions in losses.

Great read, thank you very much.

I'm wondering though (and unfortunately I didn't get an answer on wsb), is the following possible or even likely to happen?

Shorters are constantly driving down prices to scare people into selling. Convinced retailers don't, fine, but many mainstream retailers probably do. Ok, the shorters already had a problem before the mainstream joined, so even if they sell now, it changes nothing about the logic behind the squeeze, alright.

But this happens repeatedly. Can't shorters use this to basically cycle shares around? GME goes down, retailers sell, shorters cover. GME goes up again due to the squeeze mentality. More retailers get interested and join. Shorters let the price go down again, newly joined retailers panic sell again. Rinse and repeat.

The psychological game is really strong with this one.  WSB are rallying behind DFV and others who may have picked up GME at its peek.  It is like some ancient battlefield where your foot soldiers hold the line alongside with their captain.  There are people who are holding because they cannot afford a loss, holding for the sake of sending a message, holding because they want to retire early... a this point I doubt shock tactics can be all that effective anymore.

I have been buying ""stable"" stocks in companies I am familiar in (AMD, microsoft, funds, etc) for quite a few years, but GME has taught me a lot more about the market than just merely ""buying stocks"".

60,GME," Ok, this is not trading advice, and I'm not a financial advisor, etc.  This is a good teachable moment.  Do this quickly before end of day and see what happens.

Ok, if you're on Ortex looking at the short interest chart for GME, do a few things.

First: make sure you understand the definitions of every term on the chart (click the little '?' above the upper right corner of the chart if any are unfamiliar).

Next, go to 1 month timeframe.

* Turn off 'days to cover'.  If you saw the definition you'll understand why it's meaningless in a stock with high volume volatility.
* Make sure the following are on: price, volume, utilization, on loan

Now.  do The following calculations:

1/28 volume / 1/26 volume = ??
1/28 on loan / 1/26 on loan = ??

Which is shrinking faster?  on loan or volume?

Basically a squeeze is a race: will long-side vacuum up volume faster than short-side can cover all shares on loan?

Because what happens if you have shares on loan and effectively no volume available??

Once the price becomes unsustainable for their account margins, shorts are forced to buy all their shares back from whatever volume is available.  Where is volume headed?  Extend that to today (look at today's volume chart.. say  if you can).  Where is volume headed by the end of the day?  If you divide a pretty big number by the number volume is approaching, what do you get?

Also, look at the utilization.  What do you see there?  What is the definition of utilization?  at a high level, one way you can kind of think of it is how aggressively are shorts loaded up to be able to sling share volume that day.

The thing to watch now is price action into the close.  These guys leave everything on the field, so while the fundamental technicals are heavily on one side you never know until the bell rings.",jn_ku,10,/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/gla5ibq/,0.034,0.862,0.104,0.961

75,GME," Also, why _wouldn't_ the major holders of long positions want to cash out? There's no realistic comeback case where they'd ever reach even $100/share on fundamentals. 

A lot of people seem to be throwing their money into this with the incorrect understanding that it was more than 100% of the outstanding shares that were shorted, rather than the float. Further, they assume that all the shorts are going to be covered unconditionally, and by purchases on the open market. 

There's every possility of making a deal. The long holders know as well as anybody that _they_ won't be able to recoup what the shorts would have to pay to cover their positions, as the squeeze collapses. They could very well just decide to swap their GME liabilities for desirable long positions the short-sellers have, cutting the short-squeezers out entirely.

Bottom line is that there's a worrying sign people think this is a 'sure thing' based on a naively rigid idea of the short-sellers obligations. There are people buying in @ $300 and refusing to entertain the shitload of ways the businesses involved here could settle these liabilities _without_ GME holders getting rich. 

In fact they seem prepared to believe that all of Wall Street is already conspiring against them in all sorts of ways except the simplest, most direct and most plausible way possible: That the shorts make a deal to close their positions without having to buy shares on the open market.

>Melvin may have been squeezed out of their position back when GME was in the $100 range or possibly lower, partially using emergency cash injections from Citadel and Point72. Melvin would then be on the hook to pay these loans back with interest (using their other assets as collateral). WSB seems to think Melvin still has its shorts, referencing the high short % float (still >120% by [some](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME&ty=c&ta=0&p=d) [estimates](http://isthesqueezesquoze.com/)), but this could easily be new shorts not owned by Melvin. For example, my favored hypothesis is that many individual investors bought puts, forcing option contract market makers to delta hedge by buying shorts. In this scenario, I don't really see a short squeeze playing out quite as aggressively, if at all really. Market makers know how to hedge and they already know how volatile this market is. Overall, I think Melvin will probably get out of this with 30% losses or so from the event - big but not life ending. My prior is that internal regulations probably regulate when they must stop out of a bad position. There's also weak evidence in the form of CNBC rumors that they've closed their position and also the 30% number that keeps getting thrown around.

>Prediction-wise, if the above are true, we won't be seeing a short squeeze. Instead, we'll see a speculative bubble over the next couple days with some initial skepticism coming Friday (when the prophesied squeeze doesn't happen) and Monday until eventually faith wears out and bears overtake bulls and there's a massive sell-off.

edit: from what I read they are a marketer and distributor, not a producer. The rise in propane prices can be attributed to a reduction in crude oil refining, of which propane is a byproduct.

138,SPH," Gotcha.. I’m not too familiar with SPH, but higher international demand affects US propane pricing, especially nowadays

so unless they hedge the price on 100% of their propane distribution volumes (totally possible, I’m not sure) they’ll see an uplift in realizations (and sales volumes, depending on where they distribute)

EDIT: I see they pay out a stable dividend (8% yield, very nice) so would make sense that they hedge at least a solid portion of their distribution volumes",starknot32,4,/r/investing/comments/l7x71g/propane_is_the_new_toilet_paper_and_you_can_trade/glabz9b/,0.042,0.898,0.059,0.3291
139,NGL," Propane production from refining accounts for just 5-10% of U.S. propane production. The majority comes from associated oil production (Natural Gas Liquids, which then get separated in a process called fractionation to yield purity products like propane)

Lower oil production = lower NGL production = lower propane production = lower supply = higher propane prices

Higher demand from cold weather and increased export capacity is icing on the cake (and the main driver behind this recent run-up)

>SPHs ability to increase sales volume

But I really don't know who's going to win that battle afaik TSMC is currently in the lead. I feel a overlooked factor is the fact that chip production is a national security interest in some countries and will eventually become one in most sensible countries so Samsung's fabs could be supported by their government but that's a low chance just something to consider. But yea I would buy TSMC I don't know what is trading at but it's a good company but I haven't done much DD into them they hardware is just good and with only two providers and samsung yield being bad TSMC looks like they may be able to print money if samsung keeps faltering cause Intel's out of the game until 2023 according to them,Y_u_lookin_at_me,1,/r/investing/comments/l7jppw/what_stocks_are_you_looking_to_grab_at_a_possible/glap6cd/,0.079,0.763,0.158,0.9517

That's not going to happen.  What's going to happen is what happens whenever someone doesn't have enough money to pay off all of their obligations -  they are simply going to default on those obligations and seek bankruptcy protection.  At some point, the cost/benefit calculation will mean this is better than continuing to liquidate long positions, and a judge will sort out who gets paid what.  Over the course of *months or years*.

How long can the air stay in this souffle once the immediate need to satisfy shorts is eliminated by bankruptcy protection?  Probably not months or years.  So the price crashes, the shorts cover and leave bankruptcy protection.  Maybe these hedge funds disappear.  But all these thoughts about the price going to infinity are ridiculous -- at some point, it's better to not meet your obligations than to pay ""any price"" to cover them.  If the market crashes, it's because the whole thing is unstable and this drives investors to want to leave other positions, not because of some liquidity black hole.",whattheflippers,5,/r/investing/comments/l7zx7k/why_is_appl_stock_falling_after_a_blowout_quarter/glb1qcr/,0.084,0.876,0.04,-0.7085

488,GME," Hello,

I’m a young new investor. I’ve been doing my research on investing for quite a while now and really wanted to get involved after learning so much about it for so long.

So about 3 weeks ago I finally opened a Schwab account and put in $5k, which is not a small amount for me, but also not something that would cripple me financially for years if I lost it.

I mostly put it in high dividend ETFs, Vanguard ETFs, some ARK funds, and then a few ETFs in the healthcare and technology sectors. Most of them you’ve heard of before: QQQ, SCHD, VUG, VTI etc...

Over the past week, the markets have not been kind to me and I’m in the red but I know that the goal of these funds is to hold them long term and not react in the short term. I know that over time most of these funds are safe and will grow and show good returns over the next 5 years, 10 years, etc...

I am also aware of the old adage about time in the market not timing the market.

Still though, I am somewhat concerned that this past week is the start of a correction of some kind. I don’t know how large or small of a pullback we might be headed for, or even if we’re headed for one at all. Maybe this weird week has been a result of the GME situation.

I guess my question is, given how little time I’ve actually been invested in these stocks, and with the looming possibility of a correction in the near future (next 3-6 months), I’m wondering if there are any potential strategies to protect my investment in some capacity. I’m not necessarily asking if it’s advisable that I pull all my money out, but are there things to do in this situation for someone like me? Ideally I would like not to go down significantly from the onset and see my 5k turn to 3.5k and then have to spend a year or two waiting just to get back to baseline.

**DISCLAIMER:** I understand that none of you are financial advisors and and that anything you all tell me is not financial advice, just your own opinions. Anything I hear in the comments I intend to consider the pros and cons of myself and decide if it works for me.

508,USA," Off-topic backstory: Hey redditors. I've had this account for a decent minute but I know nothing about Reddit whatsoever, so hopefully  I'm following the rules (I did go through them) and posting in the correct location. Feel free to let me know what to do differently if necessary. I've been seeing Reddit bouncing off the news recently due to the recent market shenanigans so I figured, ""Hey, there's people there that know a thing or two, so why not ask them some free questions?""

What do I want? Let me just run off the template:

1. I'm a 24 year old married man living in Missouri, USA

2. I'm employed as a local/regional bulk semi truck driver. My wife is a shift leader at Walgreens. We collectively gross about $75,000/year.

3. First and foremost, I want to buy a house. I'm sick of living under other people's rules. I have no idea what steps I need to take to make that happen, as school and family did not help my wife and I when growing up. Scrounging up a down payment is proving to be an issue, and I need a crash course in learning about mortgages.

I also want to be able to afford a few toys. I need nicer furniture. I want a pool table. I love project cars as well, but can't start on that dream unless I have a house.

Seeing as I'm still young, retirement is rarely a thought in my mind. I really should start my 401k rolling, but I worry about the money I'm putting into it will be needed for something else.

4. My lease on my apartment expires in 12 months. I'm not sure if I'm in a spot where I can figure out a mortgage by that time, or if I should downsize my living space, rent again, and use the extra money to further save. I absolutely would rather the first option.

5. I don't have a whole lot of money to play with, and losing it would be a big problem. I need something safe for now, but won't mind taking some risks down the road.

6. My current savings account sits at $2300. I can spare maybe another few hundred within the next couple weeks, and y'know, tax returns are coming up soon.

7. I have a few debts. I owe about $3200 and an obnoxious interest rate as I continue to pay back the school I used to obtain my CDL.

I owe more than $6000 to two semesters of community college I took several years ago. The payment is abysmally low which is probably working against me, but I gotta get rid of the CDL payment first because of the interest rate.

My wife still owes another $2000 or so in medical bills.

I pay somewhere around $460/mo on my wife's car payment. I own my car, but it's having transmission trouble, so it might be a ticking bomb.

8. I'm not sure what other financial information will be helpful. I pay $1250/mo in rent. Ask away for anything else.

How have I invested so far? In the past year or so, I've been dabbling around with RobinHood. I'm not making any meaningful investments, but rather just trying to figure out how the market works. I watched my free stock (Eros International) for a few months as it fluctuated by no more than $1. Back in 2020, I added $50 from my bank account to expand to some other cheap stock and occasional fractional crypto. With the recent Dogecoin surge (where I put in $13 while it was maybe around .028), my investment peaked around $93. I put in another $100 this morning but wasn't sure exactly what I wanted to do with it.

564,TD,"  **Background:**

Male, 25. Soon to be married. Fiancé (F,25) is in the armed forces. She has zero investments yet as she is still in schooling. We will start a maxed out Roth once she is stationed. She plans to do 20 years in the service and retire with a military pension. I own a home already. Currently have about 55K equity in it. We will be moving in the next 6 months. we plan on having kids in the next 5 years (2-3 kids total). Both cars are paid off but we will likely be upgrading/ changing vehicles when we move due to needing 4WD. No student loan debt or Credit cards.

**Pay grades:**

Myself, 85K

Fiancé, start as Air Force E-3 ($1,733) a month. Plus BHA (Basic housing allowance) of around $1400 /month.

**Current Portfolio:**

\- 40K in 401K. Contributing $310 with employer match per pay period. 26 pay period schedule.

\- 7K in Roth. Contributing $230 per pay period. I control this account in my TD Ameritrade account.

\- 3K in TD A account of personnel stock investments. Contributing $500 per pay period.

\- Future $230 pay period to Fiancé Roth account.

Planning to increase 401K at a rate of $2,000 a year until maxed.

Planning to increase personnel stock account at a rate of $500 a year until 45.

Emergency fund is currently funded at 5K. Putting $1,000 a year at it.

**Question:**

We want to be completely Financially independent at 45. Knowing that my/our Roth's' and my 401K are not freely accessed until 59 1/2 or older, are we on track to have the cash reserves in our personnel stock investment account to bridge the 45 to 60 time frame? This math is not taking her military pension into account because i do not want to base our investing off of it. if she decides after 10 years that she wants a civilian job, i don't want that to disrupt our future plans. h

570,WLTW," Aon and Willis Towers Watson Merger

Quick question for you guys. Aon and Willis Towers Watson are set to merge in the first half of 2021. According to the terms of the deal, ""Upon the closing of the combination, Willis Towers Watson shareholders will receive 1.08 Aon shares in exchange for each Willis Towers Watson share they held immediately prior to the closing. The combination is expected to close in the first half of 2021, pending customary regulatory and other closing conditions.""

Is there a reason why WLTW stock would be currently valued at less than or equal Aon stock? Is this just to reflect the risk that the deal doesn't go through or something else?",jmanthethief,1,/r/investing/comments/l7ov2p/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gl9qyby/,0.017,0.919,0.063,0.6767

581,GME," Disclaimer: Novice here, I use Fidelity and like it quite a bit. eTrade was good too. 

My (unsolicited) two cents. if ""what's going on"" = GME, I wouldn't really start there. It seems like the proverbial bubble bursts today and, even if not, a couple hundred won't get you much play given pricing on its options etc. If your ok with not looking for a ""quick"" play, I'd recommend an ETF. You can watch it thru the day like a stock (as opposed to how mutual funds work) and you'll likely find one that uses companies you know and will know how to easily monitor. For example, I just bought some shares in JETS (airlines, which Im hoping see a bounce I'm a year or so, hopefully less).  If you're liquid cash is limited, maybe take a flyer on something small. I started my brokerage with buying MJNA (among other things) and it's actually treated me pretty well (but wouldn't recommend putting too many eggs into a penny stock).

It's a casino. Don't go to the table with cash you can't lose, don't play games you don't know, and go to the reputable ones (eTrade, Fidelity, etc).

594,USA," As you are so young (I am green with envy) you have a lot of road to travel.  So when you go to invest you should look for trends and pay attention to what is happening in the USA, politically and socially.

If you want to invest on your own then go with Schwab or Fidelity that do not charge for trades.

Now what to invest in.  Be forward thinking but practical.  I made a big mistake  with Tesla.  I wanted to buy it at 400.00 and got talked out of it.  The stock was considered by many as way over priced.  Well now that is twice that guess what I am thinking now.  Grinding my teeth that I didn't pull the trigger.  I like stocks that pay a decent amount of dividend.  I am also retired and want income.  You on the other hand should not limit yourself to what an old guy like me would do.  There are a lot of high flying sock I missed out on by being too conservative.  Don't bother with these pay us  'X' amount of dollars and we will send you a fact sheet or we will share our trades with you.  Everyone I subscribed to has been a waste of time and money.

I watch CNBC like a hawk and pay attention to trends and etc.  I have never been brave enough to do options.  To me that is fire-walking.  Depending on your risk level and interest you can do well buying and selling.  When you look at a stock look at its HIGH/LOW for the year.  When it was high what was going on, when it is low what is going on.  Is the company selling or making something that has an end of life in sight or is it selling something we will need for he future.

606,IRS," First contribute to your 401K so that you get the full matching from your company. If they do not match then don't bother.  Depending on your income you can contribute to a ROTH which is the best ever.  But if your income is too high you can contribute to an IRA.

Since I have retired I have learned a really rude lesson.  I worked all my life I saved and saved in the 401K.  Now I retire and every time I withdraw any money it is considered fully taxable income.  Ok that is not great BUT what I have found is when you add it to what you get from Social Security and if you have a retirement  income add that to your income you get bit in the rear with Your Part B and D Medicare.  They charge a monthly amount and it is based on a scale based on your tax form from the previous year.  As you earn more you PAY more and more for the Part B and D.  If your income fluctuates you will face owing money to Social Security.  I did some home renovations and I had to pull money to buy a car.  So in 2019 I filed my income tax and in December of 2020 I get a letter from Social security that says I earned more than estimated and I owe them 4800.00 for part B and nearly 1000.00 for part D.  Plus the monthly cost goes up a bunch.  So it will take me the next 4 or so months to pay them back and they basically keep my Social security check.

So what to learn from that exercise?  When given the opportunity you can convert IRS money to a Roth conversion while you are working.  Yes it increasing your income and you pay income tax on it but the money you put in a ROTH when you pull it out is not considered taxable income.  I don't have that so I am not sure if Social Security would find out about that and hit you up from more Part B and D but it sure would help with taxes in the long run.

Prepare for retirement when you are working which I did not do.  Learn from my pain.",newguytx2302,1,/r/investing/comments/l7ov2p/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gl8ozpq/,0.051,0.877,0.072,0.6199

661,GME," As far as I know, because selling doesn't require posting a margin. So someone from Robinhood could still sell to someone from Fidelity.

&#x200B;

I guess there are laws around this aswell, but wouldn't it have been worse if Robinhood halted trading altogether? At least if things went south and GME went to 0, people could still exit their current positions before it reached 0. Imagine if GME went to 0 and people weren't able to close their positions, watching the falling knife simply destroy their accounts?

&#x200B;

I feel like this is more complex than it looks and while I am pissed at Robinhood, IB, I do want to understand the reasoning behind things.

Like I keep seeing people accusing everyone of fraud, naked shorts, colluding, etc; and honestly thats not the case.  It also seems like there is a view that a single fund is short the full 140% when thats obviously not the case.

713,CME," I have to disagree. Banks can use the cash they have to make a lot of trades that are risk free. Look at the futures market for Bitcoin. BTC market price is $34,800, but Jun 2021 CME futures is 36150. A bank with excess cash can short the June futures and buy BTC in the spot market to make $1350 essentially risk free. 

I am sure there are other markets out there where you can also arbitrage and make money almost risk free as long as you have the funds to do so.",Yurion13,2,/r/investing/comments/l7spg0/on_banks_from_one_of_the_most_respected_research/gladqkn/,0.083,0.781,0.135,0.81

720,BX," I think a lot of people don't want to deal with owning MLPs - BX converted to C corp a while back and the share price ramped because they opened themselves up to new shareholders who couldn't (or didn't want to) own MLPs.

Same with Brookfield Renewable Corp (BEPC) vs the MLP version (BEP).

724,KMI," Oil demand uncertainty has the sector down.  The bear thesis is that oil demand will diminish such that dividends and debt coverage will be challenging in the 2030-40s.    Pricing reflects little to no growth expectations and dividends at risk.

I'm long in KMI over other midstream players because their natural gas pipes will power electric plants for decades and generally people over estimate how fast sectors transform.   Bears would argue regulation will hasten the demise abruptly.",capacitorisempty,3,/r/investing/comments/l848wr/energy_transfer_am_i_missing_something/glb4690/,0.165,0.761,0.074,-0.7082

726,ET," ET is trading at a very low price because its distribution got cut 50% a couple of months ago, because investors don't want to buy oil stocks (dying industry), and because financial performance is worsening. A quick look at their financials show falling revenues, incomes, operating cash flow, EBITDA, negative net income, a huge payment to non-controlling interests (the management of MLPs is sometimes disastrous / self-dealing, not sure what the issue is here). I think the stock makes sense as a recovery play, not much else.",Jmdlh123,1,/r/investing/comments/l848wr/energy_transfer_am_i_missing_something/glbax1i/,0.208,0.722,0.07,-0.9038
