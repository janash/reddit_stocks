Can the shorters cover their positions with shares owned by institutions?

5,RH," Thanks for this. I happened to notice the post right when it went up and then got taken down, and I immediately went to ""conspiracy theory."" Goes to show the state I'm in after last week :)

Speaking of conspiracy theory - I'm really curious when this is all over what history will say about the impact RH's buying restrictions had on the whole affair.

I'm sitting on a lot of shares (for a fairly regular Joe like me) and the RH stuff was the first thing that really took the wind out of my sails. It's easy to buy into ""they're in Citadel's pocket, it's intentional market manipulation!"" and that may be true, but if it's purely a liquidity situation then it's just an unforeseen variable that will end up (probably) having monumental impact on the outcome.

10,CHD," Excellent write up. I’ve been tracking Melvin Capital’s positions, both long and short, to get a general idea on what might be going on in the HF industry, especially amongst the titans. 

One of the notable trends I’ve noticed is defensive selling on the long side of the 13F holdings Melvin Capital released at the end of last year. Whenever GME starts spiking, short positions trade in-line (not nearly at the same volatility,) and longs get hammered. There’s a balance as GME slows on momentum through the day, and then crazy price action in PM/AH.

I had theorized that Melvin Capital may have capitulated (last week,) but that started seeming less likely (unless they jumped ship first to protect loss using the 2.7b capital infusion and now it’s other shorts.) Their short positions outside GME, in particular, are starting to indicate a return to being value throttled. CHD made earnings with a beat, both in EPS and revenue (surpassing last year’s revenue,) but still got forced into a down channel at close of day Friday (after a solid earnings and a generally positive sentiment.) 

Meanwhile, longs found support towards end of day (while being down overall for the month.) Melvin’s biggest long option position by cost is FISV, and LB by shares. Both have been getting beat down, but prices appear to consolidate up whenever GME (and others,) shows downward momentum. 

This is all amplified due to copy cat HFs, inverse HFs, whales, retail, sentiment, and SI that has not decreased appreciably (even if the needle has moved on short entry.) If I was an HF, I wouldn’t touch this thing with OPM. It’s turning into a movement, and retail investors are hitting something beyond euphoria. At the current rate, even if whales get out, GME is going to be associated with positive sentiment in the general public. Some media and groups like Citron Research are trying to poison the well, both to stop this crazy volatility and to prevent GME from establishing a permanent foothold above short target prices.

There is such a large inflow of data and variables, I would not be surprised if Melvin Capital bailed, but I don’t know if they could actually close their whole position. Additionally, if they have tied their holdings together in either an algo model (for HFT,) or in the structure of their HF trading model, they may be “stuck” to a degree. I’m still trying to figure out whether MC would be considered a type of Unified Managed Account, and if so, what sort of financial products could they have built out of their positions. They check the boxes: high buy-in, full discretion of funds, and what appears to be a single targeted strategy. Weirdly, they also only have 7 clients, and almost all capital comes from their companies based in the Cayman Islands (common master-feeder setup.) 

No one knows these seven clients, but if the paperwork is anything to go by, they’re actually institutions.

Melvin is still lying and trying to make others think that 'they got out' when they didn't, and all they are doing is selling contracts to each other (to other firms) on their contracts for a few bucks cheaper than they bought them, and they keep doing this back and forth to make people think that there's a sell off. 

Forget your technicals, and one thing you should keep an eye on is what's really happening. If Melvin has to pay advertisers to make others believe that they went out of their positions, that should be a sign for you to either hold or buy.

21,GME," I have a line of thought that I would appreciate your thoughts on. 

I tried putting myself in the minds of the hedge funds to understand how things may turn out over the weekend/early next week. So some hedge fund go short in GME with - impotantly - some counterparty (probably a brooker in some OTC deal). That broker is now liable to the original lender in case the HF crashes. The broker could even be the issuers of the short itself. In any case, there ought to be quite a few anxious brokers with a lot of downside in case of bankrupcy. 

If I was standing to loose billions with unlimited downside in that trade, I, as the hedge fund, would call the counterparty and ask I could buy back/settle the short for say 5-10x what the counterparty expected when they entered that deal. 

The broker/counterparty, being liable, should be inclined to accept? I see clear signs that this looks a lot like LTCM where the brokers essentially bailed out the HF and calmed the market. 

Doing so would completely destroy the short sqeeze potential and ultimately screw the retail investors. 

What do you think? What would stop the hedge funds and liable brokers from entering into something like that?",samoht124,2,/r/investing/comments/l8jwsl/gamestop_big_picture_technical_recap_125_129/gldrv86/,0.074,0.842,0.084,0.4775
22,GME," From my (admittedly amateur) perspective, I know that it isn't as cut and dry as people think because the funds haven't cut their losses yet. They must have some very compelling data on their side to convince the share lenders not to recall everything.

This post does a great job of showing that the funds still have several strategies at their disposal to manage the market and even attempt to make some money, or at least hedge, as things slide. (They most certainly will slide as the appropriate price for GME is nowhere near $325) 

So for me the real questions are:

1. Will the funds be able to keep this situation at a simmer long enough that retail gets bored, or will it boil over first?
2. Regardless of if it boils over, will they still be alive on the other side? (A huge chunk of retail will most certainly miss out on whatever happens and wind up still having long positions when GME drops back to normal levels)

Edit: on #2.. In a typical scenario I imagine being stuck with a sizeable loss on a long position would scare away most retail investors. However as op said yesterday, the risk here is external imbalanced. I imagine that anyone under a certain price point ($148?) can probably just enjoy the ride and still cut and run with profit if things nosedive. And on top of that many people are perfectly fine taking losses for the chance to know hedge fund employees aren't getting any sleep.",saltr,2,/r/investing/comments/l8jwsl/gamestop_big_picture_technical_recap_125_129/gle04zm/,0.048,0.779,0.174,0.9844

It’s nice to see some great analysis over here at r/investing is still being posted to make sense of what’s happening/ may happen in the future. Glad to have a diversified portfolio of subreddits going on here :). People like you are what makes Reddit great, keep up the good work. 

Me: 39 shares GME / $40 price invested cause it seemed like it was a smart long term value play, combined with a wave of a retail sentiment paradigm shift and a hint of MOASS as a kicker. Most people seem to have lost site of everything but the MOASS kicker at this point or are in this to screw the suits and start a political rebellion. And the greatest 1IRONYman of it all, is I really found my home on WSB because it was a refuge from the inescapable political fury that dominated Reddit, and the media in general, for so long.

It more or less boils down to the insane volatility changing collateral requirements in order for RH to send trades to the clearing house, and when there are problems there, they were forced to restrict buying.

44,RH," Good point. I remember seeing their blog post right after it happened and they were playing the ""protecting retail investors from dangerous trades"" card. So it's possible that they found themselves in a position where allowing buying put them in a dangerous position and they decided to leave selling on the table because they believe this is a bubble that will burst and they want people to get out. Ironically, this ends up trying to drive the price down which hurts everybody who has already invested (half of their users).

I still hold to the Napolean (I think?) quote: Never attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity.

I suspect RH is a poorly run company and there was a lot of stupidity involved in the decisions being made. The damage will be done either way.

That said, I am totally willing to believe that it was a move geared towards protecting Citadel and I also still believe that the infinity squeeze is still on the table.

Additional upward pressure can come when Robinhood removes the 1 share cap, assuming all trades settle early this week, and the clearing houses return to normal.  This is a worldwide phenomenon.  70 million people worldwide purchasing 1 share buys the entire total of outstanding shares.  The same for 14 million people buying 5 shares.

However, there are a lot of working millennials with a stable income who very realistically can afford to get say, 10 shares @ 320 (or lower).  If 20% of WSB are into this, we are looking at 14 million shares: that makes the WSB collective some sort of a hedge fund in itself playing on the long side.  With the media talking about this, a lot of key influencers talking about this as well, more and more people are joining the bandwagon and turning this into some self weird fulfilling prophecy.

In fact I am curious if some powers-that-be would want the giant squeeze to happen just so we can ""move on"".

It would be the worst kind of irony if RH is what opened the door for millions of investors to get in on this short squeeze play, and then also slammed the door shut because they weren't cashed up enough to let it play out.

63,TD," As a preface, this is just my opinion. Do whatever you feel is right with your money. I can’t know what is happening real time and am just piecing together info that a lot of others could probably more eloquently explain and have posted. My particular “expertise” is more on the valuation and macroeconomic side of investing than the market mechanics side, which is what is happening right now. 

I think the squeeze is still in motion, and is currently delayed. I am subscribed to the theory that Thursday was about to trigger an absolutely unfathomable gamma squeeze and short squeeze on top of it. For some reason MM’s are still being allowed to write options on this incredibly volatile and now somewhat political stock. On Thursday, that stock opened with at $500 a share and had enough raging buying power to push it $550 despite multiple short attacks putting downward pressure on it. This was going to put the $570 calls that were just made almost instantly into the money and trigger while hedging to go with all the other poorly issued call options already in the money. We then had the shutdowns by the brokerages everyone has talked about, and I’ll admit I’m not 1000% educated on that side of the business. My very basic understanding is that it was likely because the clear houses did not have enough liquidity to cover the fact that an universe-ripping squeeze was gonna take place with a starting price near $600 (we’ve never had a stock begin a squeeze that high). 

Sooo with that background of the situation laid out, time to address my comment on the availability of shares. The various brokerages all own some amount of the float of the stock with the clear houses sort of provided the liquidity to execute the trades. Some of these brokerages like TD (or Fidelity) had upwards of 20% float so they were able to facilitate trading of shares more than a Robinhood who can’t go and find the shares out there when they’re trading hundreds of dollars. We need to remember this was a micro cap company a couple weeks ago that suddenly traded more than the S&P 500 itself for two days. So what happens when the float is decreasing because of failed short attacks and buying pressure is keeping an ever increasing price floor on the stock, oh and by the way, 10-25% of the buying pressure isn’t even re-entering the float because those people hate wall st and view this as a movement and want to hold. Eventually, the shorts are out of the margin or paying interest payments so high for their new shorts that their collateral with the brokerage is deteriorating and should be margin called. Well even if your short interest has come down some, all it’s down is help prop up this buy floor. Now you need to cover your shorts which will cause a never ending price increase (aka the MOASS), oh and you’ve got to cover it with this float that the MM’s are also competing to cover with to hedge against their poorly underwritten options. This means everyone now needs to buy this limited float over and over, so the real short pressure isn’t this 120%, it’s more like 600-1200% (ranges I’ve seen from people smarter than me). 

Now with all that said, this short squeeze becomes less and less likely to happen if you don’t let anyone touch the stock because eventually people will lose interest due to opportunity cost increasing. If you’re a richer than god hedge fund, who cares you’re not gonna lose hundreds of billions on the trade now. There’s also been so much levels of illegal activity here that anything is possible. Wouldn’t even surprise me if the brokerages start doing force liquidations with loan money (market cap is only $15B rn) for “the market’s protection” because what do you even do about that in court? The loss potential was infinite, you can’t measure it, but you also can’t know for certain what’d it be. So what do you do? Probably fine them less than they would’ve lost and they win.

I’m on mobile so sorry if some of it is quickly explained.

TLDR: I’m holding but more for symbolic movement reasons. Do what you feel is right with your money. Brokerages & clear houses have liquidity issues, I’m seeing degrossing across the market, no one is allowed to buy so really on interest payments are pressuring the shorters right now and if that stays it could take forever for them to run out of money and at that point everyone may just be praying on a govt bailout per usual.",JL1v10,16,/r/investing/comments/l8jwsl/gamestop_big_picture_technical_recap_125_129/gle8i3h/,0.043,0.881,0.076,0.9698
64,GME," The data *could* be wrong, but is there enough evidence right now that support that idea? I don't see anything indicating that they are lying, but I do have data indicating that someone has been closing their positions. So why not them?

There's another way to look at this from the perspective of human behavior. Don't you think the whole ""eat the rich"" narrative that this has taken on is quite emotionally manipulative? Right now people with no investing experience think that they can buy GME and 10x their money along with sticking it to the man.

We've already seen that some of the supposed events haven't panned out. For example, the ""gamma squeeze"" yesterday never occurred because people have been slowly hedging for the entire week. It was never going to be the case that brokers had to scramble to buy GME at the end of the day on Friday to cover options because they forgot to buy throughout the week.

While the entire opportunity started on a solid thesis, rational thought has been replaced by emotion. That is a scary place to be, in my opinion.

Let me be clear that I hope that every single retail investor makes thousands. I truly hope that no one gets hurt, but I am afraid that many are about to be.  


I don't have a problem if people with cash to burn want to throw in and have some fun, but the posts in the past couple of days have become increasingly disturbing. For example, I've seen multiple people investing all that they have in the hopes of paying off medical debt or paying for an upcoming procedure.

66,GME," >Surely a lot of the bad shorts have taken their licks and gotten out and what’s left are a lot of new shorts at $300+?

This is almost certain - short borrowing rates for GME have been 30%+ all week (median rate is 0.3%)

That means people have been clamoring to get in short - any time a short exits, someone else comes in (that's why short float stays elevated), and a lot of them are in at $200-$400 / share at this point, which greatly reduces the pressure to sell. And why not, it's an economic free lunch in some sense.

Combine this with a few more issues:

1. at these prices, it's hard to see big volume in GME - especially because rabid retail buyers can barely risk buying more than a few shares, and institutions aren't going to risk lighting money on fire in a game of chicken

2. options are utterly juiced - no more gamma squeeze potential basically

Also, the borrow fee for OLD shorts was 31%. NEW shorts are paying over 80%.

71,AMC," 131% as of the 1/27 report. NOT 113%

If we’re at 131%, using the last actual data point, then there’s a lot more to go to get back under 100%

[Check the bottom of the page, “Short % of free float”](https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts)

Edit: Also, even if we get back under 100%, then we’re in the same position as AMC - still hella shortable. 

I am not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice.

Edit: I see the Director of Predictive Analytics from S3 says 113%. He states it as fact, but doesn’t say whether this is some insider data that S3 has, or whether it’s a result of their predictive modeling. However, he is the director of Predictive Analytics. I’m not 100% sure, but I think this is still an estimate. I don’t know how their financial models work and if their accuracy is tainted by the current volatility. I’ll say, prior to the volatility, Ortex model was within 5% of the real number almost every time. However, the most recent report, using data from 1/15, was off by 16%. So their model is definitely affected, no one knows how much. 

If we take their 113% and use 16% as the tolerance (which is one data point, so who knows if that’s a good idea...) then we’re between 97% short or 129% short.",Irish_I_Had_Sunblock,79,/r/investing/comments/l8jwsl/gamestop_big_picture_technical_recap_125_129/gldj3vg/,0.032,0.907,0.061,0.7689

76,SI," Agreed. In the VW short squeeze there were only a few parties controlling the bulk of the shares so the situation was fairly transparent. The current situation is distributed across a lot of shorts and a lot of investors which are not unified and don't act all at once.

Now, yes, the short interest is stupid high (or was), but that is the average over all the funds holding them. If a single firm was known to be 140% shorted, they'd be easy to squeeze to death. Retail caught the big, greedy, badly hedged shorts out big time, but many properly hedged shorts in smaller firms are OK and have SI < 100%, and may have even closed out their old shorts and replaced them.

Retail also is distributed and I'd wager that a lot of the folks posting their buy-and-holds are in fact trying to sell high and buy the dips and so retail stock will be available. If they bought in at $40 and the stock hits $350, what would the broke college student do with that? Hold forever for principle? Nice thought, but everybody has their price. It is basically the Prisoner's Dilemma - if all the individuals do hold they could potentially force the stock price to infinity, but in practice a lot of them are going to cash out earlier so they aren't the last one holding the bag.

Unless a whale wants to come in and gobble up a lot of stock for the sake of the cause, I think the squeeze is more-or-less done. We're not going to see an infinity squeeze.

TL;DR current situation isn't the same as the VW squeeze at all.

Crossed out brokers means they were ordered to stop permitting new positions in the meme stocks -- it wasn't necessarily a decision that they were happy to comply with, but they were strong-armed into it.

Here are the brokers that **DIDN'T** restrict trading (these are the good guys):

* Fidelity

* Vanguard

* TD Ameritrade -- (restricted buying options, however)

* Charles Schwab

* JP Morgan You Invest

* Degiro

* Trade Station

* Revolut

* Questrade

* TradeZero -- apparently even told their clearing firm to fuck off when asked to restrict new positions. Legends!


*edit: Personally, I think I'll be switching brokerages to Degiro after being with Interactive Brokers for over half a decade. Degiro has even lower margin fees than Interactive Brokers, which are already some of the lowest around.

Even for my IRA I finally gave up on schwab and moved it to M1 because I hate navigating schwab's website.

And I see a lot of people say TDA is fine and schwab is keeping think or swim--I won't claim to be in the know but I used to work at a firm that did marketing for TDA and I very much got the impression that schwab's long term goal was to take over everything.

122,TDA," Also wholeheartedly recommend TDA. Though my understanding is that they will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Schwab rather than be changed over to Schwab. At least that's what I've gotten from the few communications they have sent out to clients on the topic. As for why TDA, first and foremost, I think of the big, commonly known brokerages their investor education service is the best. Between them, this subreddit, and investopedia I've learned a lot since opening my account with them.

While I agree that their app isn't the best, I haven't had any serious complaints about it and it has been getting better I think. There's always thinkorswim as an option. If anything, I have more complaints about their website, especially their fund and etf searcher. 

One other thing that got me hooked with TDA was their automated portfolios service. This is a great service for people looking to invest but not ready or able to commit the time to do extensive research before investing. The website will walk you through what your goals are, risk tolerance, timeline, etc. Similar to what you were likely asked to do if setting up a 401k or IRA. Once that is taken care of, the service sets up your portfolio and takes over, handling rebalancing, reinvesting, etc. This obviously carries a management fee(I think the lowest tier of this service, essential portfolios, carries a 0.3% management fee) but for many people this might be a fair trade off. My biggest gripe with this service, or at least essential portfolios since I don't use the higher tiers, is that the questions asked don't offer much nuance in terms of answer choices. I suspect this becomes less of an issue when you start using the higher tiers. 

The portfolios service might also be a good option for potential investors who want to actually grow their money while still being able to invest on their own with a secondary account like I do. I've got a portfolios account and a regular account with TDA and the integration has been pretty good.

Yes basically, everyone has their own info on how much they actually care about this.  The funny thing the advice seems to be leaving smaller companies and jump to the big ones which has other negative implications.  Companies like RH need to exist to push the industry forward, part of the reason they blocked trades is because of the old tech on the back end of the stock market and banking system.  Large companies have less incentive to improve this especially when it raises the barrier of entry and keeps places like RH from getting too big.

220,GME," I have thought how fractional shares actually work behind the scenes and I think brokerage allowing them has to hold at least one full-share on their own name and they may not want to do it in this type of situation.

Let me explain and this is just my guess, I have no real information. So let's say you are first people on brokerage buying a fractional share (1%) the brokerage actually has to buy one share and take a stake on the remaining 99% of the stock. Once enough people have bought so that there are no remaining fractional shares and all 100% is owned by clients (fractions together total 100% of full shares) brokerage really has no risk any longer.   


Now let's take GME as an example, the price soars from 20 -> 450 and a few fractional shareowners decide to cash out their fractional shares. Basically, the only available buyer is brokerage without the ability to sell that stock forward. So they are now on the hook for that stock with extremely high prices where everyone thinks that eventually, it will come down to reasonable levels (timing is a big guess) exposing them to quite a risk/losses in the process. Same thing if someone decides to buy 0.1% of GME through fractional shares and brokerage is on the hook for the remaining portion. If my theory is correct it is no wonder if buying fractional shares are disabled, what is a bummer if they have been sold off without client having any say on it.",exlin,3,/r/investing/comments/l8nntv/by_popular_demand_official_i_hate_robinhood_and/glebuk2/,0.071,0.871,0.058,-0.3915

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze.

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DON'T BE THAT PERSON.

FRIENDLY REMINDER SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze.

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DON'T BE THAT PERSON.

I'm not interested in my ps5 currently though. Stadia has been a breath of fresh air for me recently, and I only see myself using my ps5 once more exclusives are available. Stadia is just much easier to get up and going, exit, transfer screens, family sharing, etc. All this while stadia is basically on its first public revision. 

Sony is much more than Sony Entertainment, with multiple revenue streams, but all this had made me realize they are about to get leapfrogged technologically, and that will have ripple effects across most of what the world associates SONY with.

Sony grew in the home entertainment sector by 25% YOY. There is no point for them to compete in low ranges. Sony clearly considers themselves the ""Porsche"" of home electronics. If you want a TV, you get a TV from Seiko. If you want the best of the best, Sony is one of the few options.

298,TV," I ended up with a three month trial of ""pro"" a little less than a year ago and have stuck with it since. There was a turning point at some point last year where you could tell Google was all of a sudden taking it seriously (instead of just another failed Google concept). 

As long as your internet connection is at least ok, it's a pretty flawless experience. There are other benefits too such as it works on every TV in my house via chromecast (nice with 4 kids who all want their own separate consoles), car rides via tablets/phones, family sharing (once you buy or activate a game everyone in your Google family has access to it.)

I think most people just haven't tried it and it's still early in adoption. Even though I do feel like stadia is a newfound success for Google, they may not be the ultimate winner in this battle. Someone will though and it will be one of the companies that already have massive cloud infrastructure in place ( Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, etc). The tech itself is what impressed me. It works nearly flawlessly now and I see no reason to go backwards. It occurs to me that every software service could stream this way. You could develop high end animation or video editing on a 2001 Vaio laptop and it would function just as well as a brand new MacBook pro. This can essentially even the playing field across the world allowing access to top level software without needing the hardware to back it up. 

For what it's worth, give it a try. It's free. Madden 21 is free this weekend for everyone pro or not. Destiny 2 and bomberman are also free to try the service without spending a single penny.",niftyifty,2,/r/investing/comments/l83myw/a_rough_analysis_on_sonys/gldbnwe/,0.037,0.807,0.156,0.9869

301,MS," Nope. Customers, especially in the gaming space, know the value of owning a game. 

Gamepass is a renting service and its cyclic selection of games are mostly outdated. 

Streaming will never be the future of gaming as it is a very different industry and business model compared to music and tv shows. Its closer to movies:

1) High cost of production, dozen publishers each with their own catalogue that would prefer to have say on their own income rather than through a streaming platform from MS.

2) Netflix beat TV by being an on demand service than many TV pubs did not provide. Gaming has always been on demand, via individual purchasing. 

3) Average player only plays 2 games a year. Very different to music and tv shows.

4) Sony is making more money than ever, twice as much as Xbox and growing faster than Xbox as well.

Gamepass is MS's last play for Xbox, if it fails, quote me on this, Xbox as a division will be shut down or sold.

303,CEO," It benefits Microsoft significantly more than Sony. Sony will never catch them when comes to the cloud.

“There aren’t many details about this partnership yet, but it looks like Sony will definitely use Microsoft’s Azure cloud to power their game streaming services... The biggest take-away from this news is how much of a win it is for Microsoft. It’s this kind of mutually beneficial partnership that Satya Nadella is famous for fostering during his tenure as CEO. With this deal, Microsoft is almost guaranteed to be a contender in cloud gaming. Either Sony’s services are successful, in which case Microsoft still gets a huge chunk of their revenue via server costs. Or, the Sony services don’t catch on, leaving Microsoft’s own xCloud as a bigger winner in the streaming market.

|52 Wk Low|5.00|7.50|10.00|6.00|

The chart type needs to be selected as 'Candlestick'. Then set data to rows and the relevant rows are;

347,GME," Hey guys, newbie here trying to wrap my head around the whole GME endgame. Honestly I don't get it.

If the point of GME Reddit investors is to get rich by selling the over-priced shares after the short squeeze happens (=after hedge funds start buying like hell to cover their expiring shorts), and if the very act of retail investors selling shares and getting rich will drop the price and burst the bubble, why wouldn't Wall Street sharks keep on doubling down with even more shorts right now (in order to profit from the low prices of the after-burst)?

I gave myself two answers:

A) If they double down they don't buy, if they don't buy they will eventually be exposed against the banks for the expired shorts;

B) If they double down they don't buy, if they don't buy the squeeze doesn'tt happen, if the squeeze doesn't happen the bubble doesn't burst, if the bubble doesn't burst they won't get the money from the double-down shorts;

But:

A) Is there no way for them to temporarily cover for the expiring shorts? Like, chip away at the price with HFT during the day (you know those low-volume plunges we've seen) and buy small portions throughout the week at dip levels, in order to cover the shorts at a minimum loss (knowing they'll make more when the bubble burst)?

B) Can't they fake a squeeze (=fake a price increase) the same way they fake a price decrease with low-volume HFT? Like, artificially increase prices up to the psychologically fabled 1000, which would therefore trigger the KA-CHING! party, drop prices and make them rich after all? I know that the narrative is for them to artifically lower prices to trigger a panic, but wouldn't it make more sense for them to artificially increase prices to trigger the enthusiasm (since that's what's gonna drop the price and make them profit from the doubling-down on shorts)?",anorak_899,2,/r/investing/comments/l8iifx/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/glctzp1/,0.053,0.839,0.108,0.9494
348,RH," I am not smart or savvy with investing.
But I know chicanery when I see it. I was digging through some past transactions on my account in RH & found something that I do not understand, did not trade, & have no idea what it means. I do not know what to do. I have sent an email to support and have not received a response back other than an auto reply.

This transaction appears to have occurred on jan 27 & jan 28. It’s something about VXX— of which, I know fuck all about. In the document it has my holdings. All of them. Is this a trade? Why does it say 2/5?

My account is a gold account, but I have options & margin set to off because I’m stupid enough to know that is not something I should be messing with & I did not make this transaction.

Do I risk exposure to anything or is this transaction completed with no further obligation?

Do I need to file complaints, if so; where? Is there something that I buy to offset this?

Positon: my life savings of $2000 in meme stocks in hopes of providing a better life for my wife & daugher, a heart condition, a $14/job.

Will post pics in moment if necessary.


If I make it out of this, I am looking to setup a traditional custodial roth and just have funds sent to invest into an index fund. Hands off approach.

- I am entirely new to investing.  Only started looking at ""other"" stuff last month, and have put about $500 across 1500+ ""shares"" of a few things with intentions to HODL.

- $15k on a vehicle.  <$1k in medical.  Mortgage is paid off.  No student loans or other debts in household finances.

I guess what I am looking into trying is speculative trading.  Both short and long term.  Ive got savings that I plan to keep separate for emergencies.  My union covers my healthcare/retirement separately.   I now want to dip my toes in this with some of my free money.  Id be happy just coming out with some ""play money"", but would of course love some F U money and to really help my kids future.  

Im using Moomoo (after the RH maneuevers I saw) but have no idea what to do from here.  Considered the ""big thing happening"" but dont know if thats wise at the moment, and just bandwagoning that could be an obvious loss.

Obviously, I'm expecting to pay a large chunk in long term capital gains (federal and state) and NIIT next year, so I'm holding on for at least that and I'm temporarily parking everything in a high yield savings bank account until I figure out what to do. But the real question is: what I should do with this windfall?

I'm a bit of a BogleHead historically. The traditional advice is to bank it in a mix of highly diversified indices of stocks and bonds, maybe some uncorellated but stable other vehicles like Real Estate, where my allocation is dictated by my age (~40). Maybe Dollar-cost average my way into it. But I am concerned that right now feels like a weird historical time: The Stock market seems to me to be very frothy (AMZN, TSLA, $GME, etc) right now and due to the pandemic, the Real Estate market (especially corporate real estate) is about to be up-ended when evictions start happening and people continue to work from home in the long term.

Part of me initially just wanted to pay off the mortgage, but that seems foolish the more I think about it, as interest rates are so low (I could re-finance to a ~2% APY 15yr for example, which would seem to be easy to beat in other investment domains and although it would free up monthly cashflow, I would have a large amount of money on hand if I didn't pay off the mortgage that wasn't all tied into my home).

So my question is, what advice do people have on how to deal with this windfall given all of this context?",dev_zero,1,/r/investing/comments/l8iifx/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/glcx2ra/,0.041,0.88,0.079,0.9552

Question about the Robinhood incident

A few questions for a newbie like me on what RH did a couple days ago:

1. What exactly were the 13 stocks they restricted trading on on Thursday 
2. Why were there restrictions on buying cryptocurrencies as well on their platform?
3. Were users allowed within that time period to short stocks like GME? Or were people unable to neither buy nor short in that timeframe? 
4. What did Robinhood do in particular on Thursday that other platforms like WeBull, TD Ameritrade, etc. did not?

370,GME," Hey guys, I have been trying to decide what to do with my portfolio.

Its currently being held by Robinhood and i opened a brokerage account with Fidelity.

Im worried that if i initiate a complete transfer my positions will be completely locked up for the next week (if not more due to the mass exodus). I was on the phone for a few hours waiting to get in contact with a rep.

Heres the shitty part: if robinhood goes under and I cant claim any of my GME shares, what do i do then? I know they have a statement about my shares being federally insured. However, the goal posts keep moving and im terrified. I have heard of people's shares being liquidated without their permission.

Now if I do the transfer and my shit is locked up and the squeeze truly begins, ill miss out then too. 

Basically im stuck between a rock and a hard place. I have heard so many different things about how people have been able to instantly transfer but Robinhood states they strictly use ACATS which has a quote of 3-5 business days before the dust settles.


Please help!

Edit: with the help of a few responses, i made my decision. This whole incident has really piqued my interest in investments. I'll close my accout with RH as soon as i am able to sell off what I have and still be a part of history!

At this point my best option is to hold on to my butt and keep trying to contact fidelity/Schwab/td to see if in this unprecedented times i may be able to get an expedited process on a portfolio transfer somehow.

Hey guys,

I’m considering getting in to trading stocks and would appreciate any advice you would be willing to give please! I live in the UK and have been watching $GME unfold with great interest! So I figured now could be a good time to learn about trading and improve my financials by investing a capped amount and trying to make a reasonable return on it.

Ideally I would like to be able to buy / sell stocks across any market in the world but would probably primarily focus on LSE and NYSE / NASDAQ. Can anyone recommend a good place to open an account (preferably with a decent mobile app) please?

391,UK," I am 24 from the UK, employed with a gross annual salary of £40K.

I have an outstanding mortgage value of roughly £129K which I'm currently remortgaging for a 2 year fixed, paying £607 p/m and reducing the term to 25 years.

I have an unsecured loan of £8400, which I'm paying back £8900, this was used to settle my car finance where I was expected to pay an extra 2.5K through interest. 

Given that my loan is low interest, I'm looking to start investing money. I've looked at some representative examples of compound interest which is something I'm looking to achieve, I'm looking to invest over the long term (15-20 years). I'm thinking of investing roughly £400 p/m and splitting it 75/25 in favour of safer fund investments but want an element of risk in my portfolio given that I am fairly young.

I don't currently have a S&S ISA, I believe this might the best place to start? If so, what platform would you recommend?

Is there any positions people could recommend for my risk appetite and 15-20 year investment length?

404,GME," Hi all, general advise really welcomed please. K am UK-based and portfolio is in etoro.

Seeing etoro's behaviour during the GME sagas, I have very serious concerns in their role in market manipulation (e.g. blocking purchases of stocks when allowing sales, preventing out of hours purchase orders, longer trading halts than elsewhere and a variety of shady things).

The whole thing has really shown than us individuals are actually the product of etoro, rather than their customers, in my opinion.

I don't trust them with my money.

I also have a vanguard but enjoy the ability to pick my own individual companies to invest longterm.

Is there an alternative, credible, recommended platform to use where individual stocks can be purchased, as I please? 

I believe trading212 were engaged in similar ropey behaviour? I witnessed FreeTrade allow buy trades out of hours, only to cancel them when the markets opened too, so not them either.

Next aspect is whether a portfolio can be transfered or would I have to sell all and start again?

""Reddit investors take revenge on WallSt, but only normal people will get hurt. Some maybe surprised why i am going against the majority. Unlike many people, who think that the group WSB pushing up the price of GME is to take revenge on WallSt, reality and the results are completely opposite.

First you need to understand what is WallSt and Hedge Funds. From the outside, you may think that this is a group of elites who are manipulating the market, or the super riches controlling society.

WallSt here should be understood as the financial market of NY, including banks and hedge funds. They are the intermediaries between idle cash and businesses. It is thanks to them that the economy has flexibility and growth.

But where do they get the money from? The answer may surprise you. The majority of the money isn't taken from the super rich, but from normal individuals like you and me. According to Business Insider these are the organizations that pour in money for the hedge funds.
1. 39% from public and private retirement funds
2. 20% from schools and charities.
3. 17% from banks and insurances.

These organizations gather up money from normal small individuals into a fund and then invest this money for profit, which means it is the poor and the middle class who are the major investors, not the rich. Approximately 70 to 80% of the money hedge funds manage belong to normal people.

Which means that WSB attacking WallSt is them attack themselves, their friends and family and the people they want to protect. The fund managers will still be successful, and the people who loses money are teachers, workers, charities and retired people. It's like when you hate a bank teller and you attack the bank, but you forget that banks are only keeping and managing money from normal people. People who work in finances are heroes not criminals.
Take revenge on who? On what? Nothing, it is just a shitshow to hurt the very people you are trying to protect.""",TrungPurpVN,1,/r/investing/comments/l8iifx/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gldz6d9/,0.109,0.706,0.185,0.9898

415,ATH," Is this whole GME debacle going to keep tanking the market in the short-term or are we looking at a potential crash between funds liquidating and people losing faith in the market's legitimacy?

I'm wondering if its worth pulling out. New to actually investing (everything I've done has been paper, research, and college) and put away about 95% of a sizable sum from a windfall I received a week from last Monday into some index funds and an ETF for retirement. Kept about 5k for gamble money/fun (we'll not talk about that, but at least GME is doing well for me haha). The retiremrnt money is already down North of $14k in just a little over a week.

I'm wondering if I should just take it out while this blows over and put the money back in later. It's hard to stomach so much loss so quickly basically investing ATH and now its plummeting and I'd hate to see that money basically evaporate right after I put it in there and having to wait months to years to recover.

I know retirement is set and forget, time in market beats timing the market, blah blah, but I JUST put it in and now its bleeding. I dont think I'd need any of the money on the short term. At most, I'd need like 10% of I decide to buy a house sooner than originally planned. Otherwise, I have a HYSA for emergency fund/car fund/house fund.

420,CD," Hi, the news, the weekend, and the blessings of a new fulltime job and finally paying off my last credit card balance have led me to become interested in investing.

I've done a lot of reading about hedge funds, brokers, wsb users going in together, etc., but I feel like I can't find much of anything about the actual reaction from GameStop (which I had somewhat ironically always understood as villainized by the constituency that seems mobilized to currently drive up the stock price and mess up the particular short speculators in this case).

In terms of investing myself, I think I have an okay understanding of the idea behind long term, relatively stable investments and saving with more-or-less predictable, large financial groups.

For stock investments in things like a comparatively smaller company (I'm thinking CD Projekt RED which seems to be in a short term dip price wise and having some possible legal difficulty relating to their recent game's release issues and shareholder losses), does purchasing their shares of stock help them?

They're a company who's products and prior business practice I appreciate, and I think videogames are going to continue to increase in popularity and their games in particular seem to have a strong track record of artistic and technical improvement.

I'm using this stock as an example of one I'm considering, but what I really want to understand is a framework for investing in terms of helping a business grow rather than the ""this sticks it to the man and maybe we make money doing it!"" concept that seems to underpin the short squeeze in the news right now.

If you wanted to sell people something at very inflated prices, what if instead of telling them that it's worth more than it is, you could actually convince them that by buying it they were fighting for the little guy against the big hedge funds?

445,RH," I think you should be able claim even if robin hood go under because they have to be underwritten by insurance companies by law. The concern would be if they freeze or limit buying again (the Hedge funds want you to sell - I don't think they will stop selling).

The shares that were liquidated were all bought on margins (i.e. loans from the broker) - stick with cash buys and (hopefully) you shouldn't have to worry about that. If I understand what happened correctly, they could sell those margin shares because the price dropped below a minimum value for margin shares during a ladder attack.

If you look at stock price charts in retrospect it's clear that you should have bought here and sold there. In the present you just don't know so you can only make an educated guess.

A good strategy is to have a certain limit in mind both ways. Buy at whatever point, if it drops to x I will sell, if it rises to Y I will sell. It it then rises way up and beyond you have lost nothing and made a gain. How could you have known that it will continue to gain?

If you have other investments (individual stocks), that's up to you if you want to cash out. You're thinking about it and so are literally millions of others. This next week may experience a sharp drop. We really don't know.

I anticipate many people are selling to play it ""safe"" like you. However, it's this exact mentality which causes stocks to drop. If people stopped being so emotional and selling after a ~2% drop, the market wouldn't be dropping like it did on Wednesday and Friday.

A full brokerage like Fidelity offers much more customer service vs RH's limited CS, resources (analyst reports), fractional trading, international trading (not all brokers offer this - Fidelity does, although you have to call for approval) and other things.

502,AMC," The issue last year became the current crisis IMO drove spending in a lot of areas as businesses scrambled to try and adapt. You heard many tech companies and other industries talking about years of growth/adoption in a matter of months.  In the Fall, a lot of people finally seemed to notice this and started flinging their money at Ark. This spun the flywheel of buy more Ark, Ark buys more hyper growth and people eagerly look at the lists Ark puts out every day and buys more of those names which pushes them higher which pushes Ark higher, etc. The flywheel stopped recently because everyone ran over to the new shiny of short squeezes. The question becomes with all of the hyper growth beneficiaries, how much was pulled forward?

As for houses over spending on travel, if everyone spent a shit ton on their house during this, Home Depot/Lowes/etc are going to have some difficult comps when things return to normal. I wouldn't guarantee home remodeling as a durable creator of long-term wealth. People realized they were going to be in (probably didn't think this long) or wanted to move to a different area/house that better suited them and redirected spending. Did they spend well as many houses got into a bidding war? I dunno.

The question is ... when is ""normal?"" 

New strains, vaccine worries (how many people won't, what protection from new strains, etc) and the goalposts for ""normal"" seem to continue to get bumped back. The things that have benefited from the crisis I think many people thought would have stopped benefiting by now, but really no signs of that subsiding any time soon. 

Concerts? Coachella and some other major festivals have already been cancelled. Movies are going to get bumped again (and already have in many cases) to Fall. Not that that matters to AMC, which if this wasn't bizarro world would have probably been bankrupt already. Instead, it's a meme stock so it can raise enough money to continue not having movies playing for a number of more months.

""Our first thought should be that the market is predicting years of high economic growth just around the corner.""

I'd like to agree and for years I've been sort of consistently realistically/reasonably optimistic on here but I don't know. I think there's certainly growth in some areas, but I think some of that has been taken to excess. You have people really crowding into areas, and I agree with this:

""1) **Value has become a dirty word**. Traditional fund managers used to identify a cheap stock and buy it in the hope that it would gain in value. Nowadays cheapness is a turn off rather than a turn on. **Expensive stocks get more expensive as they attract more flows, and cheap stocks are shunned as losers rather than diamonds waiting to be discovered.** One way of thinking about this is that prices used to be self-limiting. Stocks would rise to a point where valuations (earnings multiples or price-to-book) would become unattractive, which would cause the stock to go down and give valuations a chance to normalize. **Nowadays, the amount of money chasing inflows means that prices can go much higher than traditional security analysis might suggest. In a world of sluggish growth and asset price inflation, chasing inflows has arguably become the best bet to generate outperformance.**"" (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-01-25/five-things-you-need-to-know-to-start-your-day-kkd7nn2u?sref=frV97TwV)

Feels like a lot of money sloshing around looking for return even if it makes no fundamental sense. **I mean, people have been throwing money at Blockbuster - at one point that was up 4,000% or something absurd. There's nothing there, it's a shell. For all the attention paid to GME, not many people talking about the fact that fucking *Blockbuster (and again, not even Blockbuster, but what's left of the ruins of Blockbuster)* ramped. If you look at Blockbuster vs Netflix, thanks entirely to the last week or so, Blockbuster now has a better 5/10 year return than Netflix.**

And really, going back to ""value is a dirty word"", you have people who are looking at Gamestop being squeezed and that just spreads to people pumping unquestionably bankrupt garbage like Sears (which also ramped) and Blockbuster. People start thinking why go through the effort of value investing when you can pile into a long-bankrupt video store and pump it to astonishing returns in days, or look for the next short squeeze candidate? And it's Blockbuster so it's easily meme-able and Blockbuster moon-ing is something that easily gets the attention of media and people read about it and more people pile in. It's going to end badly, but it's bizarre enough to make me start to wonder/question what that even looks like. I mean, who ever expected the headline ""The White House is Monitoring the Gamestop Situation?"" or Ja Rule getting upset about not being able to trade (""Where Is Ja?"" Oh, there he is.)

I'm not negative on the short squeeze tactics (a win is a win and congrats to those who've won), but the question is where does this go - because why stop at Gamestop? After that, it'll be something else: WSB and others had an enormous win with this, have a taste for it and why wouldn't these situations continue to be something sought out?

I'll also agree with this:

""“Get rich quick” is the prevailing mood. Given the above and other speculative oddities today (e.g.
aggressive call option buying and a new Bitcoin frenzy), professional investors have started to accept (or
embrace) the notion that large parts of the market are in bubble territory. This all seems…strange against
the backdrop of the ongoing COVID tragedy and a global economy sputtering along. **Yet, most institutional
and retail investors not only survived the COVID Crash but were emboldened by it. If you survived March
2020, what’s left to fear? A global pandemic and unemployment spiking to depression levels? Big deal; last
time that happened was the buying opportunity of a lifetime.** In this context, it should hardly be a surprise
that the S&P hit new all-time highs and closed higher the day rioters violently infiltrated the U.S. Capitol."" (https://www.upslopecapital.com/s/Upslope-2020Q4-Letter.pdf)

Lastly:

The fact that Citron is not going to put out short reports anymore after this A) feels like a top and B) might suggest that any shorting is going to be done in silence going forward - and that's unfortunate because ultimately, there have been plenty of times when shorts have made people aware of genuine concerns about a company. Read a lot of good fund manager letters and you'll find quality discussions regarding their thesis on various shorts. Now, putting out a short report is going to be an invite to squeeze the stock. Funds (like Melvin) report options on their 13fs; are they going to press to remove the requirement to have to do that? There was already discussion over smaller funds not having to file 13fs.

Low-interest rates simply drive all investors into equities. Bubbles come from over-extended periods of low-interest rates, which we've been enduring because central banks can't raise them at these debt levels without causing some governments and lots of companies to default making things even worse. Granted they can't tighten credit in the middle of an pandemic but eventually further down the line this spending will catch up with the countries and large economies we previously haven't considered as being at risk of default could seriously face that threat.

The changes Apple is implementing will affect the advertisers that are using their pixel (code snippet implemented on their site) by making it harder to track who ends up buying something on their site after clicking on or viewing a FB ad. This is somewhat advanced and my thoughts are that most small businesses (who account for approx. 75% of FB ad revenue) do not use this. Even if they do, they will most likely not have anything to benchmark it against or FB will use estimates to prop up the value they are generating. My bet is that FB won't lose a substantial part of their revenue, but it will be harder for advanced users to track the effectiveness of their ad (which btw is heavily over reported by FB)",astv,9,/r/investing/comments/l8owl1/apples_privacy_change_will_hit_facebooks_core_ad/gle8jay/,0.009,0.944,0.047,0.5341

The costs, for example, involved with putting something in place to allow a mass transit system to convert to hydrogen are ridiculous at present.

579,IMO," In-situ reforming? It's not clear to me that it's cheaper that extraction & reforming on the surface & then reinjecting the CO2.  Either way, yeah, in principle you can get 'blue' hydrogen (from fossil fuels, but w/o emitting CO2).  IMO, the best way to employ this is as a stepping stone to fully renewable hydrogen for long-term grid storage. (Batteries + overbuilding renewables only takes you to 80-90% of electricity production.)  However, for grid storage, you don't need/want fuel cells -- hydrogen turbines make more sense b/c you want to use the lowest-possible capital cost per MW for standby/backup power, and turbines are several times cheaper than fuel cells. Turbines that can run 100% hydrogen are not far off.  Underground hydrogen storage can be cheap at the grid scale. We *will* need electrolyzers eventually to refill those reservoirs from surplus renewable power, and some (reversible) fuel cells double as electrolyzers, so maybe that could work out. But, again, for something that only operates seasonally, the electrolyzers need to be as cheap as possible, and akaline cells are cheaper.

Anyway, this is all far out, b/c it'll take a couple decades to get to the 80-90% renewables penetration. In the mean time, there are two business models (1) rely on government subsidies / carbon tax / etc (2) be competitive. There's a problem here where green geeks dislike 'blue' hydrogen b/c (a) it allows fossil industry to continue, and they're all pitchforks against the fossil industry (b) it's not truly renewable -- it's still a finite resource that's gonna run out. Pragmatically speaking, 'blue' hydrogen that is truly carbon-neutral is just as effective (while it lasts) as actual renewables, in terms of staving off climate change.  Regardless, when the government is picking winners, it's not clear that they'll categorize 'blue' hydrogen as a renewable. So it's safer if the 'blue' hydrogen technologies can compete directly without government assistance.

Probably the least-expensive approach to energy from 'blue' hydrogen is to use it with modified pipelines & modified gas turbines. Still, there are added expenses (modifying pipelines & turbines, reforming technology, CO2 reinjection) that mean it won't compete with just using the natural gas.  Even this approach needs government support in one form or another.

This is why I wish Biden would just do a carbon tax instead of a Green New Deal. Unfortunately, spending is more popular than taxing, so we're stuck with policies that end up being driven by sentiment & create bubbles/crashes.
