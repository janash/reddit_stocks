0,GME," Ive lost 80k over the last couple weeks on the stock market; Im not gonna lie its been difficult and my rage has come out every single day. The amount of times I've wished I could go back and close my positions or even put everything on GME when it was $40 has really affected me. I will be going into a meditation retreat for a week now though and recommend others to consider something to that extent if you're feeling dejected

1,DM," If anyone is even remotely close to this, please, please, please diversify your portfolio. Yes you might miss a Gamestop surge, but you'll be in a better place when the market drops 50%. You'll have a long term peace of mind strategy and know that it's a great time to keep buying if you have a long game stategy in place. You are 100% up if you're playing the long game (based on history anyways). Huge risk of being down if  you're playing the short game.

Episode 30 talks about your emotions as an investor and dealing with money in general.

I hope this helps, saw a comment about losing $80K, if you can't swing an $80K loss (temporarily......meaning for a couple of years), you need to look at your risk tolerance. Trading individual stocks probably isn't the right thing to be doing. 

I hope this helps someone at least. If you have any questions.....research Index Funds (SWTSX (Schwab), VTSAX (Vanguard), FZROX (Fidelity)......to start), Bogleheads, I have a quickstart guide for people that don't know how to get started......DM if you need the link.

Overall, you shouldn't be having these thoughts with money......diversify and play the long game and you'll be much better off mentally.",ataritron,5,/r/stocks/comments/lxjb9x/to_whoever_just_posted_about_having_suicidal/gpnqr1o/,0.048,0.727,0.225,0.9937

4,VERY, I know this comment may not get seen but I'd like to chime in on the teaching English abroad. It's a VERY EASY job to get into depending on what country you're wanting to be in. I briefly trained in Japan to teach English there before circumstances brought me back home. Japan was difficult to get into but most ESL jobs only require a college degree and it doesn't matter what it's in. I HIGHLY recommend those jobs if you're wanting a change of pace for a year while living abroad!,SportExplorer,4,/r/stocks/comments/lxjb9x/to_whoever_just_posted_about_having_suicidal/gpno2bs/,0.044,0.805,0.151,0.9254

8,GME," One thing a lot of new people (tons just started investing in late January because of GME) might not realize is that this isn't *exactly* like a casino. You don't throw $250 on black and if it hits red you lose it all. You haven't actually lost anything unless you sell. And while you hold a stock, you do have something, even if it's worth (a lot) less on paper than it was when you initially bought it - you have partial ownership of a company. In some cases it might only be a single stock, in others a lot, but that's at least something, and as long as you hold any stocks you'll always be entitled to dividends (if they are paid out at some point), voting rights, legal rights, and of course you still have hope that someday it'll go back up, or go even higher, than what you bought in for. Worst case, especially if you don't *need* the money *right now*, just go do something else. Let it sit for a few months or years, and just don't worry about it. Check back in like 7 years later and you'll probably be surprised ""holy shit, I thought I lost money on this, but it's worth more than I paid now!""

So like, if you're stuck with GME at $300/share or or TSLA at $850/share or whatever, don't just look at the current price and think about how much you've lost, maybe look into the companies that you now own a part of and see what's going on, what access you now have as a shareholder, etc. Basically, don't just look at it as ""I lost [this much] money"" but instead ""I now own part of [these companies] - cool."" And then maybe take a break, go find a different hobby like OP said and don't check the stock for a few weeks/months/years. Heck, if you wait long enough, maybe it'll surprise you the next time you log in as to how high it's gotten.",ZeekLTK,3,/r/stocks/comments/lxjb9x/to_whoever_just_posted_about_having_suicidal/gpov3vb/,0.069,0.848,0.083,0.205

11,AMC," We are way, way, down Tesla, And Saleseforce.  Down Apple, too.  Got into these, plus Boeing(which is a great reopening stock), after losing half our portfolio on GME and AMC, coming off the spike.  


I like to block trade, with like maybe as many as four stocks, in larger amounts of shares.  I tried diversification before, but all it did was stay flat.  I don't have time for that nonsense, and we remember, from high school, or college, 'Econ 101,' 'there is usually no profit with no risk.'

I thought that losing four grand, on Akerna, back in 2019 was bad.  That was nothing.  This is like losing everything.  Jerome Powell is like Nero, or Caligula, dancing while peoples' retirement savings are wiped away.

Jerome must not be long, nor holding, anything.  Biden ought to replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chairman, ASAP.  Powell is not doing enough to protect investors, many of whom are watching their retirement accounts plummet straight down the toilet bowel.

I seriously wish that Cramer, Elon, and Roaring Kitty, would all three satirize aloof, wealthy(55million worth), and non-holding, Jerome Powell, the Princeton boy, lawyer, and son-of-a-lawyer.  There needs to be a sense of sardonic, dark, humor here, to keep people from investor, and investments, manic depression.

Where is the outrage, from Cramer, Roaring Kitten, And Elon, when we all need to hear them clown the King Clown Powell?

DO NOT Blame yourselves!  This is Not our faults.  We are all innocent.  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell had the Power, and the Ability, to correct all of this, yet he chose, of his own free will, Not to.  Don't hurt yourselves, don't blame yourselves, because there is actually an individual, who holds that massive amount of ominpotence, to have caused a logical, relieving, correction that could've lowered everyone's collective heart rate, and blood pressure, but he chose not to.

Write, call, and email, your Congressional district's U.S. Representative in the House.  Contact your U.S. Senator, and contact the president, and demand the immediate replacement of Jerome Powell as federal reserve chairman.

You may've lost all your stock gains, like me, but you still possess your First Amendment Right of Free Speech, which you can utilize to demand the replacement of the aloof, and uncaring, cold, Mr. Powell from your U.S. Representative in Congress, your U.S. Senator in the Senate, and the president and vice-president.

You are all of their constituents.  They work for us, Not Mr. Powell.  He works for Both they, And Us.  He has failed to help U.S. investors, and U.S. retirees who largely trade their IRAs, 401ks, and other precious, life altering, retirement accounts, in which these elderly, as well young savers, DEPEND on the logical, expected, swing trading cycles of stocks to normally go up and down.

Mr. Powell had the chance to seriously alter spiking bond yields with his formerly artful and markets persuasive words.  He has failed us all.  You can civilly, calmly, legally get back at him by logically, and sanely, Not blaming or hurting yourselves, but by DEMANDING, in civil, acceptable, communication, whether written, by snail mail, emailed, telephone called in, etc., etc., to demand that your own U.S. Representative, our president and vice-president, and your own U.S. Senator seek his ASAP, immediate, replacement as Failed, Flunky, Federal Reserve Chairman.

Finally, we're now down so low we decided there's no logical point in even selling, even if all our investments go to zero.  We feel so defeated that we can't even click the 'Sell box,' anymore.  We lost so much, over 50% of our account, on the GME and AMC spikes coming down, as disgraced bag holders, when we didn't comprehend that it was the bond yields spiking, and now we've lost, exponentially large amounts, in Tesla, Salesforce, an Apple.  Now we're losing ground even in sacred re-opening, and transportation rebound, stock, Boeing, as well.

We feel Mr. Powell doesn't care, since he likely holds no investments, whatsoever, himself, per se.  He 'has no skin in the game.'  We feel the president, and/or vice-president, should make haste to appoint a new chairman, or chairwoman, who has the capacity to feel some level of empathy for the retirement investors, many of whom Powell is causing to lose everything, food money in the form of future distributions, that now are being wiped away, as we speak.

If you care about anything you, your family, or your fellow retirement investors, or even your actively managed annuities, 401ks, IRAs, or traditional accounts, lost today, please demand Mr. Powell's immediate replacement by the president, vice-president, and even suggest to your U.S. House Representative, and your own U.S. Senator, that you demand he be publically investigated, on live television, by Congress and removed by Congress, if the president won't replace him as soon as possible for the sake of the U.S. markets and current and future retirees.

It was only a small amount, about $100 of calls, but that turned into $16k for me. You can always make it back.

36,GME," You happened to reply to me and I happen to share a lot of your feelings. I was in a very dark place at the age of 25. I was bullied a lot. I feel like I lost my entire youth. I lost my virginity at the age of 27 and went back to college this year at the age of 28. I have zero work history over the last 5-6 years so I don't know if I can get a job even with a degree. I'm much better than before but still in a hard place.

I've wanted to YOLO all my savings too. I did a bit and lost some to GME after stupidly building up FOMO over a whole week and getting in at $400. I feel that things like that might be my only chance at winning some life back. Even if I manage to get a good job after 3 more years of college, I'll be over 30, I didn't have a youth, and then I'll be just giving my adult life to profit some corporation which doesn't exactly feel like a grand prize.

>Life has no natural direction, we are all just here

I've thought about this a lot lately too and I've reached a weird calm about it. Many strive for happiness. In a way I don't think you're supposed to look for it. We just take action and for some it works and for some it doesn't. Nothing is guaranteed in life.

We didn't evolve for millions of years to be better at finding happiness. Life isn't here for happiness. It just is what it is. We are all just here.",Dysssfunctional,2,/r/stocks/comments/lxjb9x/to_whoever_just_posted_about_having_suicidal/gpofjcs/,0.062,0.717,0.221,0.9946
37,SO," Being free REQUIRES MONEY. I just want to be able to move out and afford to live in a bigger city, and pursue things. Not stuck living with my parents, not barely scraping by paycheck to paycheck, and DEFINITELY NOT HOMELESS.

Did you forget that we don‚Äôt live in a society where we have Universal Healthcare and/or Universal Basic Income?

I‚Äôll never be free without my own decent finances, I‚Äôll be stuck with my parents or even worse on the street (which will probably happen eventually, either sooner or later).

I don‚Äôt want to be stuck in some small town or the hood either, or any overly conservative area (yes, some CITIES are more conservative, in the south states).

And being mostly debt free, childfree (I NEVER WANT CHILDREN, I‚Äôm antinatalist), or legal obligations to support anyone other than myself, being 25 years old, just feels wasted on me. I‚Äôm not qualified for anything other than worthless low paying jobs that require no real skill, so being debt free is pretty worthless.

Youth doesn‚Äôt mean much when it feels like (and I‚Äôm told this a lot in various subreddits) I have to wage slave away for decades and then (MAYBE) be free at 65, and then be ‚Äúfree‚Äù.

So it feels even worse, like being younger means being even further away from ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù. Like, just get life over with already. Life isn‚Äôt supposed to be like that.

I don‚Äôt want to be a 30 year old virgin who‚Äôs never had a girlfriend (I‚Äôm a guy). I don‚Äôt want to be 30 and still dependent on my parents, or barely surviving, or EVEN WORSE, HOMELESS. I don‚Äôt want to be 30 and still working a demeaning bottom of the barrel customer service job performing low/no skill tasks where everyone acts like I‚Äôm a lost cause.

Money is required to be free. I make less than $1,500 a month, cheapest apartment is $900 a month. You‚Äôre supposed to make 3x more. I don‚Äôt even like this area the best, even for a more developed area, there‚Äôs too many religious conservatives with their anti-progression values and beliefs.

There is not even public transportation. The best there is is ridesharing services (Uber and Lyft) and without a car/license it is MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE, than a transit pass in a more urban/downtown/city area would cost.

You don‚Äôt seem to understand (or maybe you‚Äôre just one of those people who think I should be content without even basic financial independence) I don‚Äôt even have a basic living income, and I do not have any qualifications for any real career.

And even if I really am ‚Äústill very young‚Äù, by the end of this year I get kicked off of my parents health insurance, and I‚Äôve been on very physically dependent medications since I was 16 (one is an SSRI, and SSRI withdrawal has got to be one of if not THE WORST types of withdrawal there is, it can even cause permanent disabilities, yet they‚Äôll just hand it out without telling you the risks, even to minors who are even more at risk since they‚Äôre brain and body is still developing).

These medications are EXPENSIVE, and the side effects can be SO ANTI-NATURAL. I wish my parents would have just made me go to therapy from the very beginning, but I probably wouldn‚Äôt have listened or cooperated back then anyway. And of course, doctors push drugs, and my parents would believe anything a doctor says (maybe less so now, but it‚Äôs a lot later now isn‚Äôt it?)

I‚Äôd be HAPPY if I could just afford a decent basic lifestyle, but I can‚Äôt even afford that.

And as far as getting a girlfriend goes, I‚Äôm not even a very good looking guy (a lot of girls have told me so) so being broke/poor hurts that even more.

38,NOW," For one you can decide to be content and realize that money makes certain things easier but isn‚Äôt the source of all happiness and contentment. I don‚Äôt mean complacency here by contentment, rather some element of gratitude.  I still live frugally and save my pennies. I don‚Äôt leverage myself to the hilt to have all the things I may want but surely don‚Äôt need. I just paid for a $22k job to be done on my fixer upper with money I saved and not having to take a loan. If I get fired today, I‚Äôm not desperate to take the first job I can get for need of money NOW to cover all the bills on the shit I didn‚Äôt need or the opportunity costs of spending that money on bullshit instead of saving. There‚Äôs a threshold here, of course.  You can‚Äôt just stop eating and paying the bills. I have a hell of a lot more going for me than my sharecropping ancestors.  It wasn‚Äôt all effort, it wasn‚Äôt all good sense, and it wasn‚Äôt all luck.  It takes a combination of them.  Unfortunately, we live in a country where the hand you‚Äôre dealt still heavily influences your outcome. Most of us wanna mitigate the worst effects of that. 

So you can YOLO all your money, maybe make it big, and more likely lose your ass. You can also go... get a trade certification, work in an in demand job, and learn the value of delayed gratification.

I think in the last week you could get a nice return on most tech stocks if shorted them, so keep that in mind.

Regarding ZM. I think it's very tricky to evaluate where they will be 5 years from now. The current $100B market cup seems indeed very expensive for a video company (was much higher when you shorted them), which wouldn't hold post covid. But the company is doing very well financially and 2020 gave them the boost in customers and cash to make investments and acquisitions (which I'm sure in the works already). So it really depends on the vision of the management and how they want to grow. I'm pretty sure we'll see a major acquisition in the next few months from them.

101,XPEV," So for me personally, I've been stocking up on oil and miners for a few weeks now. WTI Crude pushed $61 today, and you have some fanatics saying it'll hit $100 by summer. I think $75 is the spot to hit, but either way, it's a bull market. I'm in midstream more than the supermajors, but that's a personal downshift to safety over upside. MMP and EPD are targets here. For miners, all the PMs, with the exception of tin, which took a massive blow yesterday, are up. Copper is at a 9 year high, and there's talks about a super cycle. I won't comment on that, other than to say that PMs are in huge demand, and the new EV push escalates that to the extreme. RIO and VALE are my top, with FCX as an honorable mention.

Beyond the obvious, I'm loving banks as a decent upside + div play for this yield hike. Important to note here, I'm not looking to 10x in a month, but I do like safe, reasonable industries poised for steady growth. It may take a few years to see growth, but the downside is limited. BAC is my favorite, but WFC has big upside, while JPM is the most rock solid.

102,DD," Haha trust me im a newb and i make mistakes and have made my fair share so far. But i learn from them. Ive learned how to avoid the yolo meme stocks and how to do my own solid DD/ technical analysis. I am not a day trader and for at least a few years I don't plan to be one. My goal here is to be able to invest enough that in 15ish years i can send my kids to college with that money. 

The way i see it and its hard af... but take last week/ monday this week. Market bled hard af. And it made me really consider my holdings. Because being down 15-20% is scary but i picked solid companies so i trust that in a month maybe 6 that my stocks/ etf will be fully recovered. For instance i bought the dips this week. Monday was super green. Tuesday was a wash and today red. Now had i waited could have got them lower but also Tuesday Wednesday coulda been green and coulda cost me huge. So while im red i trust in my picks. 

For instance apple i bought into that at $125. Thats a steal when you look at their killer earnings and that their shares were $145 after. Plus in 10 years think how big theyll be. So holding is okay. Being down is okay. Despite what the rumors say... stocks dont always go up. But if you do good research/ dd youll recover and be fine.

Now if you are short term or day trading thats a whole different story.",DaddyDersch,3,/r/stocks/comments/lx7zf3/anyone_else_not_looking_at_their_portfolio_for_a/gplvw6b/,0.081,0.772,0.148,0.9485

Then a real red day comes along, and it has been a snowball of panic retail selling ever since. People losing 25-50% of their net worth and saying ‚Äúfuck this‚Äù and realizing the losses.

But where was the market at in May 2009? We're in a completely different situation here. In May 2009 PE was high because earnings fell off a cliff. Today PE is high because of multiple expansion.

I don't know what people mean when they talk about a ""market crash"" but there is a certainly a catalyst for a decent pullback here (raising rates). Now the S&P500 has broken through its 50 day moving average I suspect it will fall a few percentage more at least. Plus the VIX is still fairly low right now and it's unusual for selling to stop without the VIX spiking significantly over 30.

People in high PE stocks genuinely should be concerned here imo. I'm not suggesting anyone panic sell, but you need to adjust to market conditions or at least understand that investing in high PE tech stocks may not work as well as it did last year given multiples in tech growth names are already stretched and rates are rising quickly.

I don't think there is any reason for a violent sell off in the broader market, but a ~15% drop on the NASDAQ100 and an extended under performance of high PE stocks like NIO and TSLA seems fairly reasonable to me.",kriptonicx,1,/r/stocks/comments/lx5kne/why_the_market_is_not_crashing/gpna35o/,0.107,0.85,0.044,-0.9499
200,TSLA," > The all time high for p/e of the s&p is may 2009. Arguably one of the best times in history to buy stocks as we now know. So can someone explain why this is repeatedly cited as a cause for concern? What am I missing?

But where was the market at in May 2009? We're in a completely different situation here. In May 2009 PE was high because earnings fell off a cliff. Today PE is high because of multiple expansion.

We also have record amounts of leverage and retail participation in the markets which historically doesn't end well.

212,BE," Lol thanks for the kind words. :) I try to outline my points in a salient way so that everyone can get on the same page.

Sure, I don't mind weighing in on the speculation of what might shift the current regime of ""lower for longer"" but just as a preceding warning, I'm not a professional and I am not giving any advice as to how to invest. It's important that all members of this sub act carefully when it comes to handling their investments.

This is going to be big blocks of text for those that have time/interest to read, but I may as well get all my thoughts down if anyone wants to discuss.

&nbsp;

**<FED's DUAL MANDATE: FULL EMPLOYMENT, OPTIMAL INFLATION>**
The main concern I have is that presumably the broader market believes that the Fed will always come saving the market. The Fed's dual mandate is to keep a target on ""optimal"" inflation and full employment. That's it. That being said if there was a full-on crash scenario they will probably step in the banking sector to act as some last lender of resort and attempt to add stability in the market through more QE. Practically speaking, they do have limits of what they can do but I won't presume to tell others what these limits are because I honestly do not know.

&nbsp;

**<YIELD TRENDS: HEADING HIGHER = BOND BUYER SENTIMENT CHANGING>**
In the near and medium term the media narrative will continue to mention ""yield curve control"" which means that if the Fed sees rising bond yields at the longer end as a threat to the recovery, they will intervene in the bond markets to try and tamp them down. The reason why these yields would increase is just because they are insanely low from a historical perspective since inflation is targeted typically in the 2% range and the 30-year yield has been as low as about 1.27% it's moving back towards 1.85%. The longer end yields going back up right now is basically just an expectation of increasing inflation to more normal measures and it would be difficult to ""control"" these yields since it's a very very large market and sentiment for these bond buyers will change if inflation indicators tick up substantially. My opinion is that the Fed has been able to control the market in this temporary period mainly because Fiscal policy has been tight for a long long time on the back of political pressures to lean heavily on central banks for easing market conditions.

&nbsp;

**<FISCAL STIMULUS = INFLATION>**
Since we're now seeing one of the biggest stimulus bills in history, this is the start of fiscal policy that directly injects money into the hands of people that will spend it - instead of previously, where large corporations and banks were the main benefactors of the monetary and fiscal stimulus policies. This increased spending in the economy in a short period of time could actually spike inflation higher which basically means that the bond buyers will sell bonds and Fed would then have to increase rates at some point to calm down runaway inflation fears. Inflation surging is a big scary thing for them. Just as a context historically Federal Funds Rate has been about 5.0% we are at 0.25% and a year ago it was 1.75%. There is still a long way to go if we are heading back to a more ""normal"" fed funds rate.

So basically, if the Fed doesn't deem that threat of deflation to be near term, I would expect that they are more willing to allow interest rates to move up now that main street is going to fuel a significant amount of spending and money velocity.

&nbsp;

**<THE CRASH? LIKELY NOT. MAYBE ""NORMAL"" BEAR MARKET>**
Could this be the catalyst to crash the market? My personal opinion is that it probably won't be. Part of this is because we already see it coming. A catalyst for a bonafide crash won't normally be known. However, what could happen is that it could just trigger a more ""normal"" bear market in equities. This will be just gaps lower over time - lower lows and lower highs and then possible a saw tooth market for another few years. It might just be a long, painful reversion to the mean. If this causes employment measures to dip lower and jeopardize the long term economic recovery the Fed will step in with more accommodating measures once inflation is sufficiently pushed down. However, the Fed's mandate says nothing about the stock market. It could theoretically drop 5-10% over 6 months and if all employment measures and inflation look good and have positive outlook. They may not do anything other than say ""we're looking ahead and ready to deploy more liquidity in banking sector, if required - but right now we're not going to do anything since growth signals are in place"".

&nbsp;

**<WHY BEAR MARKET? HIGHER RATES, INSANE DEBTS = SENTIMENT CHANGE>**
We have to understand that the world has been addicted to low interest rates for a long time now and low growth has persisted. We now know that this QE/low interest rate experiment isn't generating growth. It's only prolonging dead companies from actually going bankrupt, causing asset inflation and enacting a high level of financial repression against the poor/savers. If fiscal policy continues to stabilize main street I would say that this is a big risk to continued Fed easing. That doesn't mean that broader markets can't go up due to growth prospects but I think the stock market has grown used to all these accommodative policies and traders have constantly been front running each round of stimulus and buying the dip without looking at debt measures that are greatly affected by rising rates. With bonds yields being abused a lot of traders are on sitting on one side of the boat.

The crappy companies will likely need to fall away before we get an efficient reallocation of capital & resources so that the indexes can be filled with actual innovative companies that are able to stand on their own and fuel their own growth. If the Fed does eventually remove themselves from markets, my strong belief is that we have to see this a positive thing for the longer run. Else, it's just going to be a harder landing as more of the economy is running on even bigger amounts of leverage. 

&nbsp;

**<WILL THERE EVER BE A CRASH? YUP, BUT YOU LIKELY WON'T SEE IT COMING>**
Is a crash coming? Probably but by the time we hear about it will be too late for 99% of normal people. We have to remember that the Fed has caused a lot of weird, unprecedented things to happen capital markets due to leverage and at the same time past deregulation has made capital market a place for gambling den instead of what it's supposed to be - a place to efficiently allocate resources. Looking at the GME situation how is it that a hedge fund can expose themselves to risks associated with a 140% short position? There is no answer to this because there is no accountability or incentive to find out. These types of moves typically involve a lot of leverage and the precursor for any crash regardless of what other people say is LEVERAGE. Are we more leveraged than any time in history vs. incomes? Maybe. This is an area that will inform the next big one. With low interest rates we can always refinance debt but once the risk-free rate starts rising across the board we might see some institutions that have made the wrong bets with insane leverage that causes a cascading effect. This is basically what precipitated the '08 Crash on a global scale. As soon as accommodating policy ends and the party stops, we start discovering who is up shit creek without a paddle. Investors are too busy dancing, they don't see the build-up of risks until it's too late. This is the part of history that rhymes.

&nbsp;

TLDR; The Fed Put may be ending due to real near term inflation. This doesn't necessarily signal a crash but this will change decade-long, held views and investor sentiment (since '09).",astroblueboy,55,/r/stocks/comments/lx5kne/why_the_market_is_not_crashing/gplxlsb/,0.107,0.808,0.085,-0.99

This is basically what precipitated the '08 Crash on a global scale. As soon as accommodating policy ends and the party stops, we start discovering who is up shit creek without a paddle. Investors are too busy dancing, they don't see the build-up of risks until it's too late. This is the part of history that rhymes.

&nbsp;

TLDR; The Fed Put may be ending due to real near term inflation. This doesn't necessarily signal a crash but this will change decade-long, held views and investor sentiment (since '09).",astroblueboy,55,/r/stocks/comments/lx5kne/why_the_market_is_not_crashing/gplxlsb/,0.107,0.808,0.085,-0.99

230,NEW," Unfortunately your understanding is incorrect. I also had this incorrect understanding. Yields rising on NEW treasuries happens because there aren‚Äôt enough buyers. ie people are staying away from bonds. Why? The belief is that inflation is coming soon. With higher inflation, people move money out of very overvalued growth stocks. Why? Because growth stocks valuations are way more based on future earnings. Look at growth stock P/E compared to value. So, if the future dollar (in 5, 6, 10 yrs etc) might be worth less because of inflation, it makes growth stocks look less attractive, thus a sell off.

Most likely this is not only due to my DD or planning but also only a fraction of mine are Western companies, and none of them are in tech field.

Could you please explain a bit further what you've meant by us heading to a more normal Federal funds rate? Do you believe this is actually going to happen and if so would it help in bringing down the inflation numbers?

What would be the key criteria for distinguishing the 'actual' innovative companies during the Federal systems' leave from the market, if such a thing occurs?

Also, would you say the terms for bullish/bearish market states can actually differ widely across the globe? Depending on the country, era, balance of expenses for a regular person etc.

I am going to need a source on that, because i don't think anyone meaningful is selling at all. When markets crashes or something more serious, SPY doesn't just pull back 2% from its ATH. 

At september and october dips SPY pulled back even 5% and that went nowhere. Though at that months we had way more people like you on reddit, literally buying at top before and selling at bottom now, the crash is only starting they say every time.

293,GME," Also, there is always diminishing returns. What good are 100 hours of research unless you're going into a really risky company (say, Tesla in 2019/2020 [seriously, Tesla has little right being so valuable, but then again, it has amazing potential and initial product results have been great and Elon has definitely proved himself a shrewd billionaire and a pretty interesting character, which pumped up the value by proxy]or GME)

And honestly, most bigger companies worth a few billions or more are generally gonna stay in the game unless they pull a fucking dumb ass move out of their ass (FTRCQ, circa 2016 for example) and go literally down 99% in a matter of months. 

So in general, unless you're going into very few stocks, without looking at diversifying at least partially in index stocks, and not averaging out over weeks or months or years, you're gonna be getting decent returns. 

Very few people beat the market and in large part its because they are someone like DeepFuckingValue whose hobby is looking at numbers and has the education to interpret the data and then go very big on something very narrow. Most people just do ""ok"". Time in the market beats timing the market unless you are pretty smart AND spend most of your free time analyzing it. And even then, there are plenty of brokers and investment managers (who get paid to beat the market and being these kinds of people that spend their time analyzing data and are educated in interpreting it) who fall short of literally just putting money into an index fund for the equivalent amount of time. 

Diversify and forget it if you want steady profits. And then use maybe 10% to play with, that is, putting it in absurd bets like GME based on some random person on the internet.

Or put money into crypto if you want the thrill of a fast profit (and a quick loss).",MagnusTheGreat,3,/r/stocks/comments/lxjbdv/psa_buy_and_hold_only_works_if_the_stock_is/gporobm/,0.05,0.756,0.194,0.9948

594,GDP," First off, there‚Äôs a huge problem in your analysis that you are equating nominal GDP growth with inflation. There are two components to nominal GDP: the quantity of goods and services and their price level. Inflation is the change in the price level. However, the quantity of goods and services sold can also increase while velocity and price levels increase, leading to a smaller increase needed in price levels to balance your equation. 

Second, Why are you so certain that the velocity of money will increase back to pre-pandemic levels? Have you looked at the secular trend at all? During the 2000 crash and recession, the M2 velocity had a local peak of 2.151 and crashed all the way to 1.901. It recovered through 2006 to 2.017, a 47% retrace of the crash. Then, a slight decline to 1.973 before the the financial crisis, which crashed the M2 money velocity down to 1.706. There was a slight retrace up to 1.741 which is only a 13% retrace before the velocity started plummeting again to today‚Äôs 1.134.

Why has the M2 velocity been declining all these years? Because increasingly, new money flows into financial assets, not goods in the real economy. That‚Äôs also why official inflation measures have been persistently low. It‚Äôs essentially due to increasing wealth inequality and the average consumer having lower and lower marginal propensity to consume, hence less and less use of each dollar in the economy. We know that the pandemic only made inequality worse. I think you will see a massive spike in spending among things rich and upper middle class people buy and hence very high inflation in those things, but not as much for everything else, and then this spending spree among the wealthy will likely subside and money will flow back into assets.

I would predict that this long term trend is not about to turn around. At most, the velocity of money will recover to the 1.25-1.26 level probably sometime later this year, or +11%. I would guess approx 6-7% of this increase in nominal gdp will come from growth in real output, leading to short term inflation of 3.5-4.5% in the latter half of this year. Then in 2022 and beyond, velocity of money will continue its decline as money supply continues to grow along with real output and inflation will be moderate despite the massive increase in money supply over the past year+. By the way, this is also the opinion of the Fed. They think inflation will experience a short term spike and then ease.",32no,26,/r/stocks/comments/lx6y06/the_case_for_inflation_simple_math_in_laymans/gplouwk/,0.038,0.883,0.079,0.9429

607,ATH," 10% is up from something like 18%+ last summer. And businesses are incredibly short staffed. The tricky part has been dragging people off unemployment when they keep extending benefits. I've seen RESTAURANTS offering $500 sign on bonuses for fuck sake.

I actually used to be a big fearmongerer about the eviction moratoriums but it actually doesn't seem like people aren't paying rent any more often than before. You hear ""30% of people didn't pay rent on time in December"" but then it turns out that's actually just how many people don't pay rent on time normally lol.

The printed money part is an issue I'm sure and I don't trust the fed worth a damn but I trust them more than hysteric redditors and don't think they would've pumped the economy up if they couldn't get more than a full year of stability. I don't know enough to weigh in on this though. But I don't think you do, either.

The economy crashed massively last March and had a massive V shape recovery. And it actually had a legitimate, physical reason for plummeting back then too. People are scared, and are jumpy. That doesn't make their fear justified. You really think a freshly reopened economy is going to struggle to generate growth when a completely locked down country somehow generated growth?

And think about what happens once Biden is done working on his pandemic response and moves onto his main issues - green energy and healthcare. Those are on the horizon still, and as soon as the tone switches from ""reopening fears"" to ""House, Senate begins work on green energy bill"" I don't think my QCLN will stay in the red for very long lol.

Take a company like Google. Last quarter they grew profits by over 40% YoY. With the top line growing by over 20%.

With really no end in site. It is a similar story with Amazon. They have tons and tons of runway. Plus on all kinds of varying timelines.

So for Google they have things like this for the very long term.

What is different in 2021 is how Tech eats up one industry after another. So 20 years ago nobody thought a tech company would own advertising. Amazon a tech company owns commerce. We will continue to see the big tech companies eat up one industry after another.

679,USA," > Especially green energy which is more likely decades out from realization.

Someone hasn't been following the action in the actual industry. [Renewables already comprise most of the new generating capacity being installed in the USA in 2021](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=46416)... and the US is one of the big laggards in renewables.  The story is even more compelling in Europe, China, India, etc.  Solar and wind are profit makers with strong fundamental growth right now (15-20% y/y growth pretty steadily). 

This is why renewable energy and lithium/batteries are my biggest investing play: even as much as they've risen, the big financial companies are still undervaluing them based on preconceived notions from a decade ago.  These assessments bear no reality to where the renewables industryies are in 2021 (and I know this because I follow the industry data closely enough that people are trying to recruit me to work in that space).  

Hydrogen plays?  That's a different story.  There's a current glut of R&D and early-stage capital going into that market but there isn't a meaningful market niche for 5-10 years there (we need an excess of zero carbon energy first before green hydrogen is worth anything).",Agent_03,10,/r/stocks/comments/lxgdb0/to_the_people_who_have_been_long_enough_in_the/gpnkin7/,0.02,0.861,0.119,0.9288

> But I don't know. Something just feels like hysteria here. The fact boomer stocks are going up proportionately to tech going down has me suspicious. If tech is in a bubble and crashing because the price wasn't justified, what the hell's justifying the relatively large rise in banking and oil etc right now?? So are we just moving the ""bubble"" into a new industry?

That pattern is called inverse. It means that people/institutions are taking money out of the overvalued, inflated stocks from the pandemic-driven stock bubble and putting it into stocks they want to own for the long term. Below is a chart of TSLA vs a few defense stocks that have value going forward.

When stocks get inflated so that they‚Äôre overvalued, even if they are good companies, people don‚Äôt let their money sit there and do nothing while the stocks stop rising and spend a year or two deflating down to reasonable share prices. They take the money out and put it into stocks that will grow, not deflate, for the next year.

The irrational thing I see is that retail traders who like these bubble stocks keep putting money into them as they fall, even tho the stocks are still overvalued. ‚ÄúBy buying the dip‚Äù in stocks that they already know is overvalued, they not investing in the stock‚Äôs growth, they are giving money to other holders of the stock who are selling the stock at a higher price thanks to the dip-buyers.

People should stop buying the dip when a stock is massively overvalued. When a stock is massively overvalued, not dipping it‚Äôs correcting. The retail traders who won‚Äôt stop buying the dip are just giving their money away to other people as they ride the bubble down as it deflates.

If people don‚Äôt know what growth stocks they own are overvalued and which can still grow, they should go out now and try to learn more about the stocks that they already own so they know which ones are dipping snd which ones are deflating for good",rhetorical_twix,11,/r/stocks/comments/lxhkx7/tech_selloff_seems_shortsighted/gpnjhli/,0.043,0.862,0.094,0.9612

With really no end in site.  It is a similar story with Amazon.   They have tons and tons of runway.     Plus on all kinds of varying timelines.

So for Google they have things like this for the very long term.

What is different in 2021 is how Tech eats up one industry after another.   So 20 years ago nobody thought a tech company would own advertising.      Amazon a tech company owns commerce.   We will continue to see the big tech companies eat up one industry after another.   Transportation is just one example.  But we should see similar with things like health.    Look at the incredible breakthrough with protein folding.

701,SNAP," I have been a DIEHARD fan of SNAP. People have ridiculed me for it saying no one uses Snapchat anymore but umm... Come on?? I deleted all social media.... Couldn't bring myself to delete Snapchat, it's never done me wrong. Millennials on Reddit say it's old news, yet as a millennial I can more reliably contact my friends via Snapchat than Messenger or even texting. And every single zoomer has Snapchat, every single one! I use it for online dating, I use it to send money, to start group chats, to document my life events... To buy weed. And that's ignoring the company's diversification lately. 

People are getting bored of Facebook, of IG, of Twitter, soon of TikTok. Maybe they use Snapchat more or less depending on the mood lately but they don't delete it - when was the last time someone announced ""I'm quitting Snapchat""? Even if they get a ton of inactive users, the fact they have a permanent spot on people's phones is substantial. Make a major update, send a few push notifications, and you've revived your app rapidly. Meanwhile people delete their Facebook app every other day. 

I sold after a big spike in price because I knew it would crash. I'm trying to pick a good day to start buying back in, probably next Monday honestly, and I'm almost considering making it close to 10% of my portfolio because I'm so confident in it haha that almost feels a little too crazy though.

Edit: This comment might have honestly changed my investment strategy lol. I'm considering realizing some 15% losses on my clean energy/EVs just to throw that all in on SNAP.

Edit2: Jesus Christ, I feel like just typing this comment I lost 5%. Even my WMT is down 10% right now... I'm buying SNAP soon that's for sure but I guess it's going to have to sit alongside ARKK and QCLN lol.

got sauce on that? only countries I can find saying that are Canada, USA, EU, Aus and some Scandinavian countries. Although thats a lot, its no were near ALL. Also most of the big oil consumers are not on that list. Most of the countries in the world simply dont have the infrastructure to move away from oil so even if they wanted to do that, they would need to massively invest in infrastructure (developing infrastructure requires boat loads of oil).

&#x200B;

People have been saying ""we are moving away from oil"" for nearly 40 years now and its simply not true and the demand just keeps going up, there is definitely an increase in demand for EV's but thats almost completely isolated to wealthy cities in the west that dont even take up a fraction of a percent of oil or fossil fuel consumption.

&#x200B;

Also something no one talks about, the world is constantly at war, some people like to live in their bubble and not believe this but its the truth, and war requires oil. the kurds are not going to be driving electric trucks and tanks into syria any time soon.

&#x200B;

When a country says they are moving away from oil, its just political confetti. Any move ""away"" from oil would require so much oil to build up the infrastructure that it would cause a massive oil bull rush for however many years it takes to beef up the infrastructure.

713,IP," I've read a lot of your comments regarding older companies (e.g. boomer stocks) like banks and airlines and believe you are misguided. These are proven companies in proven industries with proven business models. Not that there is not risk, but these companies show consistent growth (albeit slower than growth stocks), pay dividends (in most cases), and have moats (e.g. competitive advantages that protect them - like IP, vertical integration, scale, etc.) that make them a solid investment.

There are good reasons people invest in these companies.

Do you think it's easy for a startup to have the vast array of financial products, regulatory approvals and relationships, brand recognition, scale, IT infrastructure, customer service, etc.? Especially in banking, these mega-banks invest in innovation to stay relevant and buy out smaller guys too, it just takes longer than a start-up. Many larger companies in other industries have a similar M&A strategy to help innovation. They view it like many view their investment portfolio - dedicate X% to safer bets, dedicate Y% to riskier, higher return bets.

For airlines, do you think it's easy for another company to build an airline supply chain, afford the immense capital investment in infrastructure, pass reg approvals and safety requirements, etc.? Travel and consumerism is growing as tourism increases, especially with millennials and younger generation focused on traveling, and as other countries build their middle class. There is a lot of room to grow, but it doesn't happen over night.

These companies / industries are established and proven. Sure, they fail, but that's how it works and why we diversify as investors. If you want to put more at risk, you go for growth stocks that may have a great singular product/s, but lack everywhere else because they are still growing.

716,AI," First, what I don't like are trends like Genomics.  The problem is that it's just too far away.  First they need to make real breakthroughs with the science, then they need to go through years of testing in animals and then humans (which will be complicated) before getting FDA approval. I *love* Genomics on a 20-30 year time scale, but I'd rather wait 15 years before buying in.

I'm looking at bargains in AI and EVs (not the car manufacturers, but the businesses surrounding them).  

AI is already delivering tremendous value.  In fact, there's AI algorithms that have made an absolute killing shorting the market this week.  The technology is still in the early stages (as Amazon/Apple were back in 2000) with huge future growth potential.  There are smallish companies in this space that will be absolute titans in 10 years.  I'm leaning towards an ETF (like THNQ) rather than trying to pick the winners.

I like EVs because of the strong climate legislation being pushed in the E.U., China, and U.S.  Car companies (especially European and Chinese) have set aggressive goals to exit the ICE market by the end of the decade.

718,SQ," I edited my original comment, which does change things since I'm still in the process of lowering my cost basis since I sold much near the peak. However, I will be putting more money besides my gains from selling into these few positions. I'll be fully bought back into roku today, having lowered my original investment to about $37 per share. My plan is to slowly put more and more money as it falls past a certain point. It gets down to $320, I put a little in, it gets to $275, I put a little more than I did before in and so on with a target price that I will continually buy pretty heavy at. Same thing with SQ.

 I havent put any money other than some wsb gambling money into the market since September, and I sold a lot a few weeks ago, so I'm pretty cash heavy. If I had been investing this entire time, I'd probably let it keep falling, but I didnt invest and I sold, and wsb has been on a good run, so now I'm sitting on cash and watching prices fall. 

Tldr: I'm about 70% cash rn, so I guess situation is different than most. Still gonna keep slowly buying the dip until it hits a point I feel comfortable buying heavily.",hoppity21,1,/r/stocks/comments/lxhkx7/tech_selloff_seems_shortsighted/gpnx12n/,0.019,0.883,0.098,0.9393

723,AAPL," Yes banks are stable companies, airlines are about to have an increase in sales. The one example I've been using specifically, Boeing, isn't an airline though. It's an airplane manufacturer (and they have military contracts). Why would we build airplanes right now? And it's a Democrat president so I don't think there's going to be any huge new military contracts anytime soon. 

You can't justify a 35% jump in value over 6 months with either of those industries and yet BOA and BA have done it. JPM is up 50 fucking percent in 6 months, but I've left that alone because they actually have a pretty diverse portfolio and especially with the popularity of brokerages and their success with You Invest they can justify growth even if they can't justify 50%.

That's the whole reason people doubt tech right now ""it's gone up 30% in value since ___! Of course it was going to correct!"" so does that mean banks are going to correct in a few months, too? And then the money will just move back to tech won't it? Probably not as chaotically, but it's going to move back lol. We're only going to become more reliant on these post-Covid.

I'm kicking myself for not buying into a few old money stock before now don't get me wrong. I saw this coming to some extent.

I'm sitting through until things calm down. I'll reassess my Ark positions as soon as my WMT goes green again, and I'll probably buy more bank stock once it has its own ""correction"" as I've learned my lesson about the significance of old money stock.

725,JPM," Yes banks are stable companies, airlines are about to have an increase in sales. The one example I've been using specifically, Boeing, isn't an airline though. It's an airplane manufacturer (and they have military contracts). Why would we build airplanes right now? And it's a Democrat president so I don't think there's going to be any huge new military contracts anytime soon. 

You can't justify a 35% jump in value over 6 months with either of those industries and yet BOA and BA have done it. JPM is up 50 fucking percent in 6 months, but I've left that alone because they actually have a pretty diverse portfolio and especially with the popularity of brokerages and their success with You Invest they can justify growth even if they can't justify 50%.

That's the whole reason people doubt tech right now ""it's gone up 30% in value since ___! Of course it was going to correct!"" so does that mean banks are going to correct in a few months, too? And then the money will just move back to tech won't it? Probably not as chaotically, but it's going to move back lol. We're only going to become more reliant on these post-Covid.

I'm kicking myself for not buying into a few old money stock before now don't get me wrong. I saw this coming to some extent.

Right now I see tremendous potential in AIs like GPT-3 that seem to able to turn text prediction into being able to do almost anything from math to playing chess. That might be the way to a decent generalist AI that could be the holy grail of the sector, but they may come to roadblocks or just reach the point of serious diminishing returns before it becomes useful.

But their stock price is so high that even tho the company will grow, the stock price will not, infact it may go down. I think for the next 5 years TSLA stock will perform poorly.

To note, there was a huge green energy movement in the past too that died really quickly. Similarly, solar, hydrogen and etc boomed from single digits to triple digits and back down....

750,CO," My aunt was a tech founder at the time and when she couldn't explain in a CNBC interview just two days before their IPO what the durable competitive advantage of her company was, I knew they were in trouble.  But to go a bit deeper...

The internet was expanding more rapidly than there was content and demand for it... telecommunications companies like MCI (now Verizon) were making absurd infrastructure investments despite the fact that there wasn't a huge driver of bandwidth consumption.  The content simply didn't exist.

Likewise, a lot of web-based revenue models were like this... they were all interesting for ten seconds.  And then what?   There was a guy who satirized this whole phenomenon with the website zombo.com (the site is still around, with slightly ""updated"" graphics).

The other side of this was rounds of VC funding and the IPO craze... again, my aunt was involved in both, and her company had one of the largest IPO's of the 1990s, only to be bankrupt a year later because, again, while everyone was keen on this OC-192 fiber network, where the hell was the Tier 2 demand going to come from?  iTunes Music Store wouldn't even come into existence until about six years later.

What compounded it was the accounting scandals of these telecom infrastructure giants like MCI and Qwest, where they were trying to cover up their mistakes... So it wasn't really the dotcoms.  It was actually infrastructure: Ciena Corp, Juniper Networks, JDS Uniphase, Copper Mountain Technologies, Norstan, Nortel, the list goes on and on and on... 

That's when the real shit hit the fan and institutions started putting two and two together realizing that while the enthusiasm was there, the actual consumer demand wasn't materializing at the same pace because it couldn't.  People had vague notions of the internet fueled by the likes of movies such as LAWNMOWER MAN and JOHNNY MNEMONIC.. so completely removed from the reality of telco's struggling to deliver 256 Kbps speeds more than 15,000 feet from a CO.   

It wasn't until an online book reseller patented one click purchase that this changed in two ways that are reflected in the market capitalization of two companies: Amazon (the book seller) and Apple.  Apple quietly licensed that patent from Amazon in 2001 and launched the iTunes Music Store in 2003 after CFO Fred Anderson had reorganized and restructured the business and Steve Jobs eliminated 90% of all projects in a single meeting in the fall of 1996, putting them on a focused track of building a product ecosystem around what he called the ""digital hub"".

The reason computers are the multimedia hubs they are today has everything to do with what took place in that meeting, which also resulted in the immediate firing of about 30 product managers.  But what Amazon and Apple figured out was that the internet's greatest power wasn't VR bullshit or other bandwidth hogs that didn't really exist yet and nobody would know what to do with it if they saw it... it was the convenience of eliminating every middleman in the delivery of consumer staples & consumer discretionary, from underwear to music.  It transformed consumer goods into a high gross margin business, and it completely obliterated distribution models that had been in place since the 1940s.

Likewise, a lot of web-based revenue models were like this... they were all interesting for ten seconds.  And then what?   There was a guy who satirized this whole phenomenon with the website zombo.com (the site is still around, with slightly ""updated"" graphics).

The other side of this was rounds of VC funding and the IPO craze... again, my aunt was involved in both, and her company had one of the largest IPO's of the 1990s, only to be bankrupt a year later because, again, while everyone was keen on this OC-192 fiber network, where the hell was the Tier 2 demand going to come from?  iTunes Music Store wouldn't even come into existence until about six years later.

What compounded it was the accounting scandals of these telecom infrastructure giants like MCI and Qwest, where they were trying to cover up their mistakes... So it wasn't really the dotcoms.  It was actually infrastructure: Ciena Corp, Juniper Networks, JDS Uniphase, Copper Mountain Technologies, Norstan, Nortel, the list goes on and on and on... 

That's when the real shit hit the fan and institutions started putting two and two together realizing that while the enthusiasm was there, the actual consumer demand wasn't materializing at the same pace because it couldn't.  People had vague notions of the internet fueled by the likes of movies such as LAWNMOWER MAN and JOHNNY MNEMONIC.. so completely removed from the reality of telco's struggling to deliver 256 Kbps speeds more than 15,000 feet from a CO.   

It wasn't until an online book reseller patented one click purchase that this changed in two ways that are reflected in the market capitalization of two companies: Amazon (the book seller) and Apple.  Apple quietly licensed that patent from Amazon in 2001 and launched the iTunes Music Store in 2003 after CFO Fred Anderson had reorganized and restructured the business and Steve Jobs eliminated 90% of all projects in a single meeting in the fall of 1996, putting them on a focused track of building a product ecosystem around what he called the ""digital hub"".

The reason computers are the multimedia hubs they are today has everything to do with what took place in that meeting, which also resulted in the immediate firing of about 30 product managers.  But what Amazon and Apple figured out was that the internet's greatest power wasn't VR bullshit or other bandwidth hogs that didn't really exist yet and nobody would know what to do with it if they saw it... it was the convenience of eliminating every middleman in the delivery of consumer staples & consumer discretionary, from underwear to music.  It transformed consumer goods into a high gross margin business, and it completely obliterated distribution models that had been in place since the 1940s.

Tesla was the catalyst, since the old manufacturers didn't have a reason to cannibalize their ICE sales until Tesla. But neither batteries, electric motors nor inverters are super secret technology.

Tesla is also showing us that the manufacturing part is difficult to ignore. They still can't build a car of anywhere near Toyota quality.

903,DD," I'm fairly new to the investing as well, but my Roth is made up of mostly ETFs. Similar to you I chose $BLV, but also have $MDY, $VOO, and $VYM. Along with the ETF's I have positions with Apple and Delta.

I have a second portfolio for my traditional IRA which is made up of the following:

$PLTR
$BATT
$ICLN
$BNDX
$BND
$VOO
$ARKK

30% of my total portfolio is in $VOO, 10% is in the bond ETFs, and the rest is split up among my other positions. This portfolio is positioned for growth over the next 5-10 years while attempting to stay somewhat anchored with my exposure to bonds and the S&P500.

As far as choosing ETFs be careful not to over diversify yourself or invest in ETFs with similar holdings. Conservatively, long term ETFs with low expense ratios, decent dividends, and broad market exposure will pay off in 30 years. But you can always interject growth, mid-cap, and small-cap ETFs to get exposure to more volatile equities. As far as further diversity, especially once interest rates begin rising in a year or two, it would benefit to look into commodities, real estate, insurance companies, banks, and potentially oil in the short term. Some of my suggestions would be:

$BAC
$JPM
$RIO
$CAT
$VALE
$MORT

(Honerable mentions, AllState, Exxon, BP)

As far as my IRAs I max out your contributions every year. However, that will depend on each individual's circumstances if they are able to or not. Another strategy would be to set up automatic transfers from your bank account on a weekly basis into investing account of your choosing. That way in becomes automatic and steadily increases overtime.

904,AI," Do a lot of thinking about the world and what it will look like in 18 months, 3 years, 5 years.   Reevaluate these ideas every few years because they aren't static.  What areas of our lives will change and how will they change.  Based on that, think in themes and diversify into those themes.  Dollar cost average in over time if you are able.  Some ideas might be, AI, Energy and Green energy, EV's (batteries, charging stations, components), Globally what's happening, 5G, Security, Financials, Cloud, Fintech, Travel/Leisure/Entertainment, healthcare and medicine.   As far as your son's college, I would still use the tax advantaged 529plan for at least part.  I saved $200 per month when my kid was in diapers, a few years later raised it to $250.  Then doubled that for about 5 years ($250 twice monthly), backed off to $250 per month, then stopped all together about 4 years ago and let it grow.  He's 18.  There's over $120K.

953,AMD," > With news of Mar 18 release of the 6700 XT and overall demand expected to remain high/consistent through the year, stock will continue to go up.

I like what AMD is doing, but right now they're having supply issues. These supply issues are AMDs biggest challenge in the short term. Releasing a new graphics cards isn't going to help with the supply issues. In fact, generally speaking premium products have the larger profit margins than economy products. If you consider that the 6700 card is the cheapest in the 6000 series, then it could hurt AMDs bottom line since it is competing for resources with AMDs higher end GPUs.

I'm not saying don't buy AMD, but I wouldn't use the 6700 as the reason to buy AMD.",UWwolfman,3,/r/stocks/comments/lxlp5v/is_amd_a_good_buy_on_the_dip_today/gpnyyys/,0.065,0.882,0.053,-0.3993

People are willing to pay well over $1K for a 3070, they will definitely buy something that similar in performance and half the price on release day.

I also think crypto mining will continue throughout the year too. As long as interest rates stay low, cryptocurrencies will continue to look more appealing.

955,AMD," I agree that this card looks great on paper. (I don't know if there has been independent 3rd party benchmarks). But you missed my key point.

AMD cannot current meet their demand. AMD cannot manufacture the 6800, 6800 xt, and 6900 xt fast enough. These cards are sold as soon as they hit the shelf. The 6700 will compete with these other AMD GPUs for manufacturing resources. And since the 6700 is cheaper than these other cards, the 6700's profit is likely less than the margins of these other cards. It would make more sense for AMD to sort out their supply/manufacturing issues first, and then release this card. If you can't meet your demand, then (all other things being equal) you maximize your profits by prioritizing the product with the highest profit margin.",UWwolfman,1,/r/stocks/comments/lxlp5v/is_amd_a_good_buy_on_the_dip_today/gpo8igt/,0.035,0.842,0.122,0.93

That said, their PE multiples are not egregious and they‚Äôve underperformed the S&P over the last decade. The bank play is if you expect rates to rise AND you don‚Äôt think the fed will fix rates (like they did in the decade post WWII) then banks could do really well. General consensus is they tend to do better when interest rates are higher and they can offer more spread between savings and loans. My bigger worry with banks is they get disrupted by fintech; I think this is probably Jamie Dimon‚Äôs biggest worry as well. When was the last time you walked into a consumer bank and thought ‚Äúwow, that was a really great experience‚Äù?

I took a look at banks a few weeks ago and think most were fairly valued. I actually liked the Canadian banks (TD, BNS, etc) more and thought they generally offered better value. If you buy those put it in a Roth to avoid some tax treaty stuff.

1023,MSFT," Can you tell me before you invest next time so I can sell some positions before the dip? Jokes aside, also know you can invest $1K a month rather than $15k in bulk

Now, to answer your questions. Check out VTI, I personally like it more than VOO since it includes small and medium cap companies, so it can be seen as a bit more risky, but also more diversified. I also like QQQM and QQQJ if you like a bit more risk and like tech.

As for this selling. Why do you want to sell? It has only been a few red days and if you don‚Äôt need the money now, there is no reason to fear. The market can bounce back without a notice and harder than ever and once you take the money out, it will be harder to time back in. If you own a stock you no longer believe in, sure, you can sell. But if you‚Äôre holding stocks like MSFT, has anything changed for you to not like them now? In my opinion, the news is all the same, the market is just down a bit. Let‚Äôs hear Powell‚Äôs speech at 12 today and just ride it out. Come 3 months this will likely bit a distant memory. Also, if you want to invest in only VOO, why not keep everything you have and just start putting all future investments in there?

Oh, and while I don‚Äôt believe this day or any time soon is the ‚Äúend,‚Äù I am a bit of a bear and believe we have a bigger correction/crash looming somewhere in the near future. The real question is, how much will the market grow in between now and then and how much will you miss out in opportunity costs by sitting out. 

Tl:DR, Check out VTI over VOO (but both are great).

With all the partnerships Draft Kings is sparking up, they're the big dog. There's always some huge long shot possibility Draft Kings gets purchased by a big player down the line. Maybe Amazon since they want to corner the NFL network market.   


Maybe a casino portfolio scoops them up for a big price tag. Too many positives now. Was hesitant on buying in today because of the huge run up, but it's just gaining too much traction in an environment like this.

I think considering it was $40 less than a year ago, for it to rally into the $200s seems too overvalued, even given that I'm a huge fan and supporter of the stock. 

Anyone that enters now is assuming 5-6x the risk of all the slightly early comers, during a market that now seems to be losing stability. I feel it can still dip below $200, if you zoom out to the 1-year graph, this dip still looks like a pinch in the graph. With all said, I'm holding it at an average in the mid 2-digits, so I'm likely also semi-bias with prices I'm used to seeing.",LifeInAction,7,/r/stocks/comments/lxmfbq/is_sq_a_buy_at_this_price/gpnvacx/,0.039,0.835,0.125,0.9209
1127,SQ," The best way to answer these questions is with math, not wishful thinking. A simple formula you can use is the modified Graham Intrinsic Value formula. 

[https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/stock-valuation/benjamin-graham-formula/](https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/stock-valuation/benjamin-graham-formula/)

To get numbers roughly similar to modern pricing, we can use a P/E of 7 and 1xg. SQ has an EPS of $0.44. It has no historical earnings, and thus no historical earnings growth rate, but we can use Yahoo's estimated future rate of 54%. We also use the AAA corporate bond yield of 2.85%. 

This results in an intrinsic value of $41. At the current price of $227, this represents a -82% upside. 

So no, I wouldn't buy SQ at this price. It's entirely speculative, and requires a growth rate far surpassing what the analysts expect.",CaterpillarWeird9087,2,/r/stocks/comments/lxmfbq/is_sq_a_buy_at_this_price/gpnz1z6/,0.047,0.851,0.102,0.7218

1133,IMO," As someone who works in the biotech sector, here's my advice for you: Don't get into pharma stocks. They're extremely volatile unless you have good insight into their research.

1142,CAR," Hey, I wasn't trying to be condescending. I'm not lying to you, I'm telling you why, scientifically, it's hard to treat cancer. That isn't propaganda from the medical industry,  it's facts. I did broadly answer your question about why we can't just isolate one type of cancer and just cure it. A good example, if you actually want it, is the CD19 CAR T cell therapy. It basically cures CD19+ B-ALL, but a not-insignificant number of people see their cancer return because the cells stop expressing CD19. So now we have to develop treatments for CD19-negative B-ALL, and so on. It's interesting you pick flu to talk about, since the vaccine is not that effective compared to other vaccines, and of course there are multiple types of flu viruses so I'm not sure what you're getting at there. And for the record, Magic Johnson has HIV, he is not cured of it. He takes the same drugs that other HIV+ people take every single day. They may have been experimental at the time he started, idk. If you want to complain about regular peoples' access to drugs, costs, etc, I'm right there with you.",mgpenguin,6,/r/stocks/comments/lxj575/anyone_willing_to_gamble_on_the_success_of_a/gpnllhv/,0.152,0.773,0.075,-0.9681
