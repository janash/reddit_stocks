The damage is irreversable and it IS a war against retail investors and families, it dilutes value in stocks and companies. It is financial terrorism on an epic massive scale, robbing not only Billions of dollars from people but hope fairness and any resemblance of equality. How many have been destroyed by this? How many technologies and companies have been bankrupted? Prison is too good for these devils. We know AMC had over 3.2 million investors back in early May with a conservative estimate average of 500 shares each. Thats 1.6 BILLION shares not including new mass influx of shareholders and shareholders from outside the US.   There are only 500million authentic shares authorized. This is so extremely devestating.

105,ID," I think its within the realm of possibility.   The election was close-ish last time, with noted irregularites regarding then Secretary of State Kemps potential influence on the election

From the wikipedia page on that election:

Kemp retained his office as Georgia Secretary of State throughout the campaign, leading to allegations of a conflict of interest for overseeing an election in which Kemp himself was a candidate. During the campaign, he was called upon by former President and former Governor of Georgia Jimmy Carter[227] and the Georgia chapters of the NAACP and Common Cause, to resign. Kemp refused to do so[228] until after he claimed victory, two days following the election. Kemp also accused the state Democratic Party of hacking into the state's voter database a few days before the election; however, an email released shortly after the accusation was made showed the party warning election security experts, highlighting ""massive"" vulnerabilities within the state's My Voter Page and its online voter registration system, not an attempt to hack the database, as Kemp had claimed.[229]

Irregularities in voter registration occurred prior to the day of the election: over 300,000 people were wrongly flagged by the state as being ineligible to vote,[230] and 53,000 voter registrations were delayed by Kemp's office without adequately notifying the applicants.[231] These irregularities, which disproportionately affected black voters, resulted in allegations that Kemp was using voter suppression to increase his chances of winning the contest.[231] Georgia election officials responded to these allegations by stating that any voter flagged for irregularities could still vote, receiving a regular ballot (not a provisional ballot), by providing ID at a valid polling place, as is required of all voters by state law.[232] Concerning the question of why the pending registration status mattered if those voters could vote normally at the polls, critics claimed that learning of this status might discourage those voters from turning out to the polls at all.[233]",hgyt7382,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsvma5/i_analyzed_all_the_controversial_trades_made_by/h0p87q8/,0.07,0.872,0.058,-0.296

What is the reason why a man with an avarage job could provide for his stay at home wife and 2 kids and now 2 working people are struggling to get a house and pay the bills? Has the standard of living grown faster?

Aging is also a thing, people just don't die anymore, and we are using a lot of money to stay alive longer. This will even out in the next decades but we got used to that exponensial growth. There are so many people resources are getting scarse, we have exceeded earths limit long ago imo.

But these major problems are still not the largest contributing factor. Inequality is.

*edit because it caused confusion*
If we would *create a system that* redistributes every dollar owned by people who have over 100M (company money excluded, only personal cash) a lot of problems would just vanish. There will always be balance, don't think there can be super rich without a lot of super poor.

461,ALL," I am not giving any financial advice. I am not a financial advisor.

So when you short a stock, you are expected to return the share by AT MOST 21 days back to the person you borrowed it from. 21 Trading days, not calendar days I believe. When you short and do not return the stock, you are failing to deliver the stock back to the original owner, and this is called a FTD and there is a fine you have to pay. Now, nobody likes to pay fines, and also nobody wants to buy back the shares from the open market as it's since gone up. So they need some kind of scam to make it look like they returned that share and basically reset the clock. When they hit the T+21 cycle, we ALWAYS see the price go up as they pull their shady stuff and they buy options or in some cases, the actual share does get returned (rarely ever). Usually they run this options scam that creates illegal shares but that's another article. When this ocurrs there is a price bump. Sometimes it's a small bump, sometimes it's a huge bump. On days like Mondays, it's often a huge bump because a big rise in price doesn't hurt the short share holders between Monday-Wednesday, because they can short MORE on Thursday and Friday. Why do they seem to want to short MORE on Thursdays and Fridays? It's because they don'y want to pay options and puts that are in the money. They are manipulating the market to hit the max pain point. 

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp#:~:text=The%20Maximum%20Pain%20theory%20states,of%20options%20to%20expire%20worthless.

It's like this: You can short 5 days a week, and be out of shorts on Friday, OR you can just wait til Thursdsay, and fire all your bullets on Thursday and Friday and scare people out at once to drop the price to the max pain point (Giving HF's huge profits). So there is an incentive for them to short on Thursdays and Fridays. So Mondays through Wednesdays are usually quieter on the shorts. It does happen, but not as often. So Because there has been a massive short position of a variety of meme stocks apparently ALL AT THE SAME TIME (which makes little sense) apparently the Trade day + 21 days to buy the stock and return it, seems to cause increased volatility on that day. Sometimes it seems to be the day before, sometimes the day after. However the next one for GME is 6/9 Wednesday. How does that relate to AMC? Well oddly enough, there are some who speculate (WARNING: RUMOR) that this past bull run on Wednesday and pullback is wave of some kind, and that approximately 7 days from this past spike we should see the next wave, which oddly enough, is 6/9 ALSO! What a strange coincidence. Now, shorts know this too, so they are greasing up their shorting guns ready to fire. However if it's the T+21 days, often times they don't short as they are changing clips from the old empty clip to the new shorting clip for their shorting gun, and this clip change causes a huge rally for the stock. There have been several mathmaticians who have gone back in history for GME and AMC and have found the 'bumps' from the T+21 shorts cover and you can see it does show a bullish day closing in green. 

So even if you are new here, there is strong evidence that you MAY GET LUCKY if you buy in on the Friday Dip prior to the T+21 week, and exit your position at the high point, taking profits, assuming you guess where the high point is (nobody knows). This is largely luck combined with math and a casino. 

I personally am expecting one BIG day between Monday and Thursday, with a Max Pain crash Friday somewhere close to $40. Again, I could be completely wrong on this, but given the data that others have collected, there is bullish sentiment for GME on 6/9 which also corelleates to a wave for AMC on 6/9 (although it could be Monday-Thursday, or friday although unlikely) as the date floats.

463,BIG," I am not giving any financial advice. I am not a financial advisor.

So when you short a stock, you are expected to return the share by AT MOST 21 days back to the person you borrowed it from. 21 Trading days, not calendar days I believe. When you short and do not return the stock, you are failing to deliver the stock back to the original owner, and this is called a FTD and there is a fine you have to pay. Now, nobody likes to pay fines, and also nobody wants to buy back the shares from the open market as it's since gone up. So they need some kind of scam to make it look like they returned that share and basically reset the clock. When they hit the T+21 cycle, we ALWAYS see the price go up as they pull their shady stuff and they buy options or in some cases, the actual share does get returned (rarely ever). Usually they run this options scam that creates illegal shares but that's another article. When this ocurrs there is a price bump. Sometimes it's a small bump, sometimes it's a huge bump. On days like Mondays, it's often a huge bump because a big rise in price doesn't hurt the short share holders between Monday-Wednesday, because they can short MORE on Thursday and Friday. Why do they seem to want to short MORE on Thursdays and Fridays? It's because they don'y want to pay options and puts that are in the money. They are manipulating the market to hit the max pain point.

It's like this: You can short 5 days a week, and be out of shorts on Friday, OR you can just wait til Thursdsay, and fire all your bullets on Thursday and Friday and scare people out at once to drop the price to the max pain point (Giving HF's huge profits). So there is an incentive for them to short on Thursdays and Fridays. So Mondays through Wednesdays are usually quieter on the shorts. It does happen, but not as often. So Because there has been a massive short position of a variety of meme stocks apparently ALL AT THE SAME TIME (which makes little sense) apparently the Trade day + 21 days to buy the stock and return it, seems to cause increased volatility on that day. Sometimes it seems to be the day before, sometimes the day after. However the next one for GME is 6/9 Wednesday. How does that relate to AMC? Well oddly enough, there are some who speculate (WARNING: RUMOR) that this past bull run on Wednesday and pullback is wave of some kind, and that approximately 7 days from this past spike we should see the next wave, which oddly enough, is 6/9 ALSO! What a strange coincidence. Now, shorts know this too, so they are greasing up their shorting guns ready to fire. However if it's the T+21 days, often times they don't short as they are changing clips from the old empty clip to the new shorting clip for their shorting gun, and this clip change causes a huge rally for the stock. There have been several mathmaticians who have gone back in history for GME and AMC and have found the 'bumps' from the T+21 shorts cover and you can see it does show a bullish day closing in green. 

So even if you are new here, there is strong evidence that you MAY GET LUCKY if you buy in on the Friday Dip prior to the T+21 week, and exit your position at the high point, taking profits, assuming you guess where the high point is (nobody knows). This is largely luck combined with math and a casino.

468,AMC," I'm finding it very difficult to get a proper answer to this anywhere, so I'll ask here if you don't mind: I'm an AMC investor from all the way back when it was worth around $10 per share two or three months ago. I had assumed this was a classic case of shite luck, as I bought 20 shares at that price immediately before (as in, less than twelve hours before) they announced that they were further diluting the float, thus (I thought) nuking the chances of a short squeeze by essentially allowing shorts to cover without having to convince apes to sell. Felt like one of those ""shit happens"" moments.

In the intervening time period, there have been several other moments of apparent dilution. However, apes here and on the AMC subreddit keep talking about how these stock issuances don't actually count as dilution, and the media is misleading people on the true nature of the issuances.

My question is, what's the actual story here? I'm more than happy to hold for a squeeze or even just for the stock to naturally go up based on post-covid recovery, *but*, it does strike me that the peole running in AMC seem to have an unquenchable thirst for stock dilution (somewhat understandable given the company's financial situation due to closures) and therefore, it sort of feels like no matter what we apes do, any kind of squeeze is slipping away into the abyss as a realistic possibility, the more the float gets diluted and thus the more opportunities shorts have to cover without having to come begging *us* to sell our own investments.

What am I missing here? So many people are posting that none of the recent issuances are relevant to what we're doing as far as attempts to squeeze the shorts, but nobody so far has actually explained how this could be the case.",hatrickpatrick,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsrosb/amc_yolo_lets_goooooo/h0odvbj/,0.037,0.903,0.06,0.6629

Tuesday they report pre market and will crush numbers. I guarantee it as a Texan that shops there. They sell guns and ammo, so you can't directly compare them to dicks. Overhead is much lower too.

I just went to bass pro to buy ammo because of a friends tip they were stocking shelves. By the time I got there, huge line. It's like this at academy too.

Now you have summer with people going outdoors. Austin airport is requiring people to show up 4 hours early because of the TSA wait. The summer play is going to be hot AF and academy is at the forefront. Texans shop at academy. It's a bonefide pure hold for the next year for another 300% gain from here.

Im playing by fundamentals here so cant explain the squeeze part but im pretty sure by now we got a bigger short interest than we did before the moves.

Either way the question you are asking means you still have at least 2 braincells working on your brain so good for you, maybe someone can correct me and show us the DD but i think the momentum was due to meme stock hype and bcause we feel company is way undervalued moreso than a squeeze but who knows we may have gotten on the uprising the short float we lacked",AustinPowers007,13,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nskgcb/can_i_get_an_explanation_of_the_short_term_play/h0n08xg/,0.014,0.82,0.167,0.9854

573,BB," My honest opinion, as a shareholder (180), the hype can be traced back to June 2, when it opened 10% above it's close.  Before that time, I had 50 shares, but I saw what looked to be short term momentum.  I bought some dips looking to hit my target of $30 several months early.  

When apes say ""moon"", I don't know what that actually means.  $1000/share, 1000% gain, idk.  I don't think half of them know what it means either.  FFS they don't know that rockets do not go straight up, but none of that shit actually matters.  What matters are your own reasons.

I bought BB for stable growth in a company that I considered to be a steady mover with long potential.  Since I am kinda new, I pussied out of buying long calls and bought shares.

637,BB," Im not experienced in options to answer that i can only explain why i went in, i like the stock, i just believe in fundamentals and we got momentum, if many more pple feel as bullish as me then stock will rise and will force MM to hedge against the options, either way im solely playing on fundamentals and momentum, i feel there is no shorts to squeeze and actually think if apes are as retarded as me, I think gamma squeeze might be possible although i dont really care about it; also with these wild volumes and rising prices it opens the doors for many people to ask themselves if they want to short the stock if they dont like the fundamentals as we do; either way answering your question BB is long term hold only reason it became short term is cause momentum and hype, if enough pple believe the time for BB to raise is now then short term play becomes possible

640,OI," I mean shorting a stock is a legitimate strategy if you believe the share price is higher than what it should be but yes technically if a stock has any short interest it can be squeezed, the magnitude of it will vary. What I don't get is how there is a short squeeze play since the borrow fee at the moment is 0.4% so there isn't much pressure to cover, per my other comment to another user.

*So I don't have the estimated short % at the end of today. I did look on fintel and saw that the short volume ratio for the day is 20% but couldn't that be positions opened near the $20 mark and covered within the day as its been steadily dropping to $13? With the gamma squeeze angle, wouldn't there have to be a significant amount of open interest going up the options chain in the next week? From the post, I tallied that the total OI from $13-$18.5 strike only accounts for only 0.8% of the total float*",mtw132,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nskgcb/can_i_get_an_explanation_of_the_short_term_play/h0n830c/,0.01,0.872,0.118,0.9606

645,BB," I'm going to point out that 24% short figure is actually short volume ratio which is different. Short volume ratio is the number of sales sold short for the day divided by total number of trades for the day. In this case, there was a short volume of 41M shares sold short out the 174M shares traded today which is how a short volume of 23.69 is reached. That does not necessarily mean the stock has a 24% short interest. Because it's the daily short volume ratio, a person can open a short position and close it within the same day, that would increase the short volume without increasing the short interest because the trade cycle had already completed. The short interest would be the final amount of shares that were sold and not yet covered which could include previous days.  
The total float (total amount of shares that can be traded) of BB is 566M shares, so only 174M shares out of the 566M exchanged hands today. If you took today's short sell ratio as the final short interest, then it would be closer to a short interest of 7% but of course people can still have open short positions from previous days so the figure could be different.",mtw132,19,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nskgcb/can_i_get_an_explanation_of_the_short_term_play/h0nts06/,0.0,0.884,0.116,0.9294

It’s really helpful for managing risk and finding those support or resistance levels that you see on charts.

What I had to remind myself of a reality that starting $20,000 and having 7 100% days/weeks/whatever puts you over a million dollars. We get hooked on the idea of 5000% gains but truthfully they are incredibly rare and often are surrounded by 100% losses. From now on, once a holding hits 100% I'm out. Looking at the last year we've had easy opportunities to jump 100% at least monthly. If I make a 100% gain a month for the next 7 months I will be a millionaire just after the new year.

714,CP, I’ve been long on this company since January.  You make a lot of good points including the USPS fiasco.  They only delivered 6 trucks part due to supply chain issues and part in a production snags ( a recipe for disaster).  They have made improvements since then.  They could have produce more vehicle but took the time to produce a better quality rather than increase the quantity.  A side note is a significant portion of the loss can be directly contributed to the write they did for the stake in $RIDE which is a no cash item.  They also have about $200 million of cash on hand. Since I opened my position in the company back in January I have averaged down many times since then. CP is ~900 @ 13.52. I’m not very good at including links in such but this can all be googled searched.

881,NEW," I see two issues (and yeah I'm open to correction)

1. Inflation is not hyperinflation.  I lived through mortgage rates at >12% in the 80's.  That wasn't hyperinflation then, and it would not be now.
2. Effect of interest rates on bond prices.  CURRENT bond prices would be worth less.  NEW bond prices would be worth more.  That's what higher interest does...makes bonds worth more.

A long time ago before 2008, the market used to swing between bull and bear in a 4-6 year cycle.  Stocks for 18 months, bonds for 18 months, see-saw in-between.

Personally, I believe the feds are going to give congress ample time to pass a new budget one that takes inflation into account. So, they can raise interest rates simultaneously.

891,IMO," The issue I have with this whole inflation debate is that it's being blown way out of proportion, in comparison to the reality. CPI numbers were driven by used car sales, and to date, there haven't been any big numbers popping out to look scary. The YoY wage increase was only 2%, despite the layoffs that were seen following covid. These increases have tended to stick around 3%, so to see them fall sub par could imply that inflation is actually moving slower than expected, as companies evidently may not have the funds to support that wage increase. Just my 2c on the issue, but IMO, SPY puts are not the play right now, since for hedge funds, there isn't really anything worth being scared about.

Usually, but not always, we need a big catalyst to set things off. For 2000, that was news of Japan officially entering a recession, in 2008, it was reports of a decline in home sales and durable goods orders, stoking growth fears, for 2020, it was the fear that covid would have a bigger impact than previously thought.",Traditional_Fee_8828,31,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsfy1d/the_big_short_20_collapse_of_the_bond_market_is/h0mh4c6/,0.113,0.844,0.043,-0.9429

I think in 5 years we see that $50 - $80 dollar price. That seems like a good exit area to me. Most Nat Gas analyst think that the resource has a strong window for the next 10 years. So I don’t think you need to completely exist the position in 5. Of course it could be much more valuable and they could be growing or creating other projects. Things like carbon capture tech and entering into hydrogen gas could keep this company relevant much longer than 10 years. With all companies you invest in it is important to keep tabs on it, at least on a bi-weekly basis. 5 years is a ways out and so much can happen. This stock could also catch fire in a Reddit retail sense and we could zoom to $50 and then crash back somewhere. At such point I would sell and re-buy. As long as the company

New investors see the price on Monday and buy, and then see the drop on Friday and sell paper hands. I buy on Fridays during the Max Pain dip, and sell on Mondays/Tuesdays during the spike.
