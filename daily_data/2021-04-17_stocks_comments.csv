Snap is a bet on applied AR.

Square will become a fintech behemoth surpassing the legacy players as they expand offerings.

The stock has pretty much found its rock bottom around $57 this week, and Cathy has been buying the whole time. Earnings are May 7 and will likely be a major catalyst for the stock considering the amount of revenue they are likely to have made in Q1 from some major sporting events. However, this is a long term buy and hold. Currently only a quarter of the population has access to legal mobile sports betting. Also, SB Tech integration around September. DKNG is moving away from Kambi, their backend sports-book operator. SB Tech is owned and operated by DKNG and will allow them to vertically integrate the company and cut reliance on 3rd parties.

I think the one speculative stock I like that I purchased recently was lam research, I aim to hold that for years though. Other than that I'm bullish on banks, I picked em all up early March 2020 so I'm already doing well on them. Goldman Sachs I really liked  last year, it's growth is priced in, if it doesn't keep it's pace the share price will likely falter. 

I like Cigna a whole lot right now, as well as vertex pharmaceuticals. I do not own vertex, I sold last year. but I would like to own it again at some point, I've been buying cigna more recently. 

GE is my favorite, I've been playing it last year with leaps and 3-6 month calls and decided that I should finally buy some shares with all the sweet gains it has given me. 

Constellations and altria I like a lot because it's safe marijuana exposure without the pump and dumps. Also altrias dividend is nice although I don't view it as a value stock, I may have to trim that one down as I see it getting close to overvalued. 

APD is a great stock, good green hydrogen and commodity play. More low-key and a boring slow mover but I see in the next 5 years it doing very well.",third_legatron,1,/r/stocks/comments/msqx2g/5_stock_picks_for_the_next_5_years/guwawi6/,0.027,0.724,0.249,0.9942

238,EQC," Same I’ve been invested from 2016 until last December. But just because it’s being performing well in the past translates into a great performance in the future. 

Tesla’s market cap is ridiculous to other automakers. Lately I’ve heard “but Tesla is so much more than just a automaker”. 
Let’s say their data, solar energy, super charger network and battery manufacturing accounts for 66% of the free cash flows in the future (more than optimistic)

It would still mean that Tesla as of today is the most valuable car manufacturer by far. Other manufacturers change into the EV business (e.g. Volkswagen) and have a higher market share overall. In my eyes they will benefit from the slow transition of the human population towards EV. They will build their EVs and can rely on a good revenue stream from gas powered vehicles. Moreover, I strongly believe that the old big players simply build prettier cars in the same price segment (e.g. Mercedes EQC vs. Tesla Model X) when it comes to interior and in part exterior (e.g. gap size model S vs. BMW i8). Of course they are superior when it comes to the battery and range but let’s be honest if you would get an EV most people don’t want to travel 600 miles in it (there’s been some research that the average trip in Europe is around 30 miles). 
That’s my thoughts on the car manufacturer side. 

In terms of data: I just don’t see the business case which bring in ~$50-100 bn a year. (Based on Facebook forward looking revenue multiple)

In terms of solar: I am honestly not keen when it comes to this topic. But a lot of European and American manufacturers of solar panels got into trouble because China was able to undercut their prices. 

Super charger network: either they stay solely for Tesla which leads to the conclusion that they have to become the biggest car manufacturer in terms of revenue to justify the valuation or they open up to other manufacturers and suffer from a USP. 

Last argument against their valuation (probably the one I get the most hate for): Elon musk. I love him as an entrepreneur and visionary but I don’t think he is a good lead of a company. Being stoned on an interview and tweeting stock related information is just not of help sometimes. Moreover a company should not invest in bitcoin. As a shareholder he takes on a risk that I am not willing to take and he is certainly not in the position to evaluate the risk and rewards threshold of every shareholder. 

However, I strongly believe that Tesla is a good company and will be around for a long time. The valuation is build in such a strong growth case that even great result and stellar performance by Tesla will not result in growth potential of the Tesla stock itself. The bar is simply to high already.

248,TD," “Do you think it’s too late”

That’s what I ask myself about Tesla. 
But that’s another story. 

Is it too late for Amazon? I don’t think so, It has been stagnating the last 7-8 months, but if you look at its 5 year chart, it’s stagnated for a year and a half, and then suddenly started to climb higher. 
I think it might start to climb higher sometime soon in the next few months. 

Maybe now is a good time to get in? I think it’s got a few years left, maybe 5-10? But that’s just me guessing. 

According to analyst reports on TD Ameritrade it should reach 5200 in a year. Other people have said 4,000. I’m not sure.

So for example, if you are in your 30s it would make no sense to invest in IBM even thought it has high dividend payouts. However, if you are in your 50s IBM is not a bad deal.

278,AAPL," I am pretty sure AAPL pays a $0.82 dividend per year and is not really the best dividend stock to look at for an example. A company like Pfizer is a solid dividend paying stock since it has a yearly dividend of $1.56 per share which come out to about a 4% dividend yield (yearly dividend/market price). The dividend yield is what you want to look for in a high dividend paying stock. 

The benefits of dividend investing is the income that it pays out each quarter that can be treated as passive income. This strategy is not best for a younger retail investor since high yield dividend stocks tend to be fairly stable and do not have much room for price growth. Dividend investing is best when you have a larger amount of $ and are fine will less potential capital gains growth. 

It is possible you can find a good dividend paying stock at a time where it can appreciate in value along with paying the quarterly dividend. This strategy is not normal though and typically is going to only come into play when there is a large market dip like we saw last year with the news of Covid.

Not to mention the type of tax you pay will be different and probably higher percentage for having rentals.

Dividend stocks are passive income. You talk about the dividend side, but you forgot to consider the stock growth portion. For example, you bought into MAIN at $31 a share last year. It pays $0.205 per share monthly. You pay $3,100 for 100 shares so you are bringing in $20.50 a month just from that stock. Fast forward a year later and the stock is now up to $42 a share. You now have $1,100 growth if you decide to sell plus $246 of dividends. Both are taxed at 15% if you your active income is on par with the average person.

349,GME," Not everyone is cut our for individual stock picking. And that's ok. This is why passive ETFs exist and thrive. Most people end up not beating a broad market index long term because at the core, emotions get in the way. The emotions you describe are what you said are getting you down, more than the loss of money. The psychological aspect of trading is something few mention but is at the core of most trades. 

While you are learning about stocks and doing research, put the majority of your money or future money in a broad market index. Something like VTI or VT if you want to include the whole world . 80% of your money goes in these, and every month contribute some more to it. The other 20% of your money can be for your more speculative plays. These speculative stocks though go up or down. Tuning out other people's chatter is something you'll have to do no matter what in life. There's always someone bragging about a new car, new job, new house, etc in real life and the echo chamber of subreddits is no different. Gain porn and loss porn is a thing and some people just love watching it but at the core, they are bets and gambles. Things based on feelings or because someone else did it, or because they think it's a part of an overall movement. Whatever it is, it's not logical and that's why they are speculative. If ppl are asking why you didn't invest in dogcoin, shrug your shoulders and say you didn't want to. If they tell you how much they gained and how you missed out, nod and say good for you. 

There's always gonna be another bus. Always. You may not have got on the GME bus or the dogcoin bus or the next yolo bus....but there's gonna be more busses. There will be more opportunities.

He had conviction and had studied this stock in and out and was mocked incessantly in wsb by the same ppl what now worship him as their lord and saviour.

355,CHPT," What do you mean “like many of you” I’ve been investing since the days that every trade had a broker fee. I had a little exposure into doge but it was less than 1% of my portfolio. It’s very easy for other people to say why didn’t you do this or that after the fact but you can only do what you know at the time. People online are only posting extreme losses or gains you’re not seeing a true representation of how well people are doing.

So are you investing or trading? If you’re investing you’ve only been doing it for 3 months so I don’t know why you’re beating yourself up. Here’s the thing, right now we are still in a bull market so the people that don’t know what they are doing and just follow the crowd thinking they are investing by putting most of their portfolio onto on stonk and diamond hands  congrats we made money yay. 

Those people will jump ship and eventually loose interest in investing during a slowdown like if we get inflation based factors creeping in. Also many of those people have no idea what to do with the money they made and will waste it in some type of way. Look at a community such as wall street bets. A very small handful of the people involved actually demonstrate a deeper understanding of markets while the vast majority are dumbasses posting memes. If they do gain they will eventually make a market mistake and loose it over greed or take the money out and buy something that depreciates like a car. 

I think the point is that you’re learning from these early losses and in the end you’re going to be a stronger investor. This is a long time experience and not one that you become an expert in within a few months and suddenly become a millionaire. 

I loose sometimes, I bought CHPT at the ipo thinking the fundamentals were good and they had an established EV network in north america. Turns out people hate SPACs and I was in the red for a long while until Uncle Biden announced the infrastructure plan, I was able to sell at a small gain thankfully before  it dropped again.",robin_the_rich,7,/r/stocks/comments/msozip/how_to_zoom_out_without_missing_important_news/guu5csw/,0.098,0.776,0.126,0.9305

357,NIO," I am with you. Started in mid-Feb, lost 15%+ of the sizable portion I put in. It hurts.

If you're looking for advice, here's what I've done:

\- Tried to learn what I did wrong. Honestly, I (and possibly you) bought at the top after a massive bullrun in 2020. I didn't know what any of that meant in mid-Feb but I do now. Now, when I buy stocks, I have a much better sense of stock valuation so I think I'm buying stocks when they're good deals rather than inflated at ATHs.

\- Chalked it up to education. Honestly, the losses hurt a lot. I wish I'd invested a lot less to start off with, I wish I'd bought VTI at 200 it was at a month ago, etc. But it's the price of education. I'm trying not to let it beat me. I even created a second account where I put different money in (smaller amounts) and I've made much better decisions with it. Helped me get some confidence back and keep going.

\- Cut some losses. I think \*most\* of my investments will be ok long run. The only one I have doubt about is NIO, which I didn't even like in the first place but got pulled into hype. So I'm loathe to take a loss but I'm genuinely scared it's too inflated with limited future and it's stressing me so I'm selling some at a loss. It sucks, but it helps me feel/sleep better. I tell myself in a few years (or 30 when I retire) that it'll be worth the learning pain and I'll have a higher net return than if I hadn't been investing at all.

Hope that helps! I'm feeling the pain too. Better luck and growth to you.",HonestlyDontKnow24,2,/r/stocks/comments/msozip/how_to_zoom_out_without_missing_important_news/guv7h1t/,0.164,0.649,0.186,0.8276

363,GME," Completely agree with this. After a year of quarantine (which played a bigger role on our psychology than we will ever know,) I found the GME situation a distraction and was hopeful about 'sticking it to the man'. I became a bit obsessed with the news and Reddit.... then I literally watched as the media lied about WSB promote Silver. I think that was the turning point for me- that EVERYONE has an agenda. Follow the money, find the truth. 

I think that was the turning point for me; we can only rely on ourselves to do our own research and figure it out. Even then we might be wrong, but atleast we learn for next time. If it was easy, everyone would be doing it. Listen with a grain of salt- again, EVERYONE has an agenda, and it's usually regarding making money. 

Be gentle on yourself and keep learning. Turn off the news. Read and take pointers from known investors... and find the 'pointers' that contradict each other just to see both sides of the idea and which one works best for you in different situations. Ask ""why"" at every turn AND THEN FIND THE REASON. 

Personally, I have no idea what I'm doing and I'm not sure I ever will lol but I will never put 100% faith in the media or Reddit again. Love love my fellow apes, but as always, we all have our own agendas.

366,GME," The ""March madness"" was known to happen since January, in theory before that but at that time it could have gone either way. But no one knew when exactly it'll start.

Reading your comments I'll give you this advice: get out of penny stocks asap. You belong to the targeted group of people that want to promote a stock and get out asap after a profit, leaving you in there on a negative. This can be a pump and dump or you simply missing the move - or if you came from GME, then screaming ""hold the line"" while there never was a line. Jokes aside I think you get my point.

First of all you would need an indepth analysis of those companies since they exist or had possible name changes, what people changed in leading positions and where the fuzz came from and what changed. If you have no clear answer as to why you should continue (and no, saying it's at -70% so who cares is not a clear answer) then get out, take what you still have and go for something else. The market is already recovering for I think 1-2 or 2-3 weeks, so if you didn't get major jumps upwards your stock is most likely dropped.

Next, where to go from here? I recommend leveraging ETFs. Either something like S&P 500, ARK or a share that is considered a boomer share. First educate yourself throughout what leveraging is, the risk, the cost, the difference of leveraged ETFs and leveraging ETFs and take these as a safe approach (well, as safe as the market can be) to build up a decent position and feed from that. Just being in the market and the top economical holder is usually a guarantee to grow, but it's slow. So leveraging amplifies that but comes with risks.

I have a main account I invest into options, but after 3 years that was too much for me and I needed some rest, so I went into pennystocks. I kept nearly all of my money in that account but put 5k into one for pennystocks. Overall I'm happy but the gambling aspect feels even worse than with options, so I decided to put 2.7k I had open from that account into a CFD account of the same broker and bought ARK ETF worth $16k. Not the safest purchase but definitely one that can pay off way more than regular economical ETFs and if it goes wrong I lose only 2.7k, if it goes well it will have 16k as a baseline to profit on and not only 2.7k.",oodex,15,/r/stocks/comments/msozip/how_to_zoom_out_without_missing_important_news/guuh5fa/,0.1,0.772,0.127,0.9339

I have also ABNB at a similar price. At this time its down to 178.69, which makes your investment a 2,9% loss. That is literally every day noise in the stock market.

However, I know that feeling when we make an action, we want immediate feedback. We want validation. We look for that feeling of: I did my DD, now I deserve a reward. It's this process that releases the dopamin in our brain before even buying the stock, just the expectation of reward is enough. It's basically the same mechanism in your brain as gambling.

When stocks turn green after you bought them, that's immediate validation. Now you want even more, since it worked last time, it will this time, right? That behaviour is quite common and creates a failed breakout that ultimately can lead to a correction. You can be assured, the way stocks traveled over the past months is some strong evidence that there is a significant amount of traders behaving just like you did. And always did, if you look back in time.

Stock market can be really tough to handle. It's an 8 hour a day 5 days a week open Casino with our bets on the Roulette wheel that we can carry on a phone in our pocket constantly around us. It is ideal to make us go crazy. I recommened to have some limits to when you check the stock market instead of starring at candles for no benefit.

What helped me was it what most people here wrote, making a plan. Make a plan how long you are willing to hold a stock, can you carry the risk of price drops. A plan can also be not to buy a stock. The result should be that no matter what happens, you are prepared for this. If something suprises you too much, your plan was probably too narrow.

An example of mine is, I bought Microsoft about 7 months ago. It was almost all the time crampling lower than my buy in level. But my conviction is: MSFT is too big too fail, too many people have interest in this stock, it's as essential as the air we breath. ETFs need this stock to move or they wont move either. No brainer for me. So I am highly convinced it will move higher over time, it may take up to a year for that to happen, but ultimately it will. All I can do is wait for that to happen. And I had to wait for almost 8 months now to see some significant upside. However, during the horizontal period nobody talked much about MSFT. People I told about it were like, urgh, maybe that wasnt a good pick after all ...

Another example is NVidia, that also traveled sideways for 8 months with their overpriced GPUs being sold out everywhere. Short term playing stocks is really trick and I would not recommened it.

Also, don't compare yourself to others. Compare yourself to how you acted before. Improve yourself. There is no point to compare with some long term investors with different strategies, mindsets and experiences.

Back to ABNB: They are my late reopening play. I bought them at a similar price point as you did, but only as a small position. I think they are gonna have an insane year with the reopening. I cant even remember the alternative website, so competition is quite low. Their numbers got crushed due to covid, huge upside potential. Landlords already charging huge premiums with increasing demand. People will travel while Covid is not out of this world so they might be looking for something more private than a hotel. However, it's valued at over 100B, so it is already at high valuation levels. I keep my position small. If it drops, I will average down. Although it has shown some significant support at around 174$ among all this correctionw wave, so I dont consider that too likely. What I think is we will see some consolidation over the next couple months, until we see some uptrend towards September/October when Wallstreet realizes everythings booked out at astronomical prices.",DeepSkyAstronaut,9,/r/stocks/comments/msozip/how_to_zoom_out_without_missing_important_news/guvk82z/,0.053,0.853,0.094,0.9725

However, I know that feeling when we make an action, we want immediate feedback. We want validation. We look for that feeling of: I did my DD, now I deserve a reward. It's this process that releases the dopamin in our brain before even buying the stock, just the expectation of reward is enough. It's basically the same mechanism in your brain as gambling.

When stocks turn green after you bought them, that's immediate validation. Now you want even more, since it worked last time, it will this time, right? That behaviour is quite common and creates a failed breakout that ultimately can lead to a correction. You can be assured, the way stocks traveled over the past months is some strong evidence that there is a significant amount of traders behaving just like you did. And always did, if you look back in time.

Stock market can be really tough to handle. It's an 8 hour a day 5 days a week open Casino with our bets on the Roulette wheel that we can carry on a phone in our pocket constantly around us. It is ideal to make us go crazy. I recommened to have some limits to when you check the stock market instead of starring at candles for no benefit.

What helped me was it what most people here wrote, making a plan. Make a plan how long you are willing to hold a stock, can you carry the risk of price drops. A plan can also be not to buy a stock. The result should be that no matter what happens, you are prepared for this. If something suprises you too much, your plan was probably too narrow.

An example of mine is, I bought Microsoft about 7 months ago. It was almost all the time crampling lower than my buy in level. But my conviction is: MSFT is too big too fail, too many people have interest in this stock, it's as essential as the air we breath. ETFs need this stock to move or they wont move either. No brainer for me. So I am highly convinced it will move higher over time, it may take up to a year for that to happen, but ultimately it will. All I can do is wait for that to happen. And I had to wait for almost 8 months now to see some significant upside. However, during the horizontal period nobody talked much about MSFT. People I told about it were like, urgh, maybe that wasnt a good pick after all ...

Another example is NVidia, that also traveled sideways for 8 months with their overpriced GPUs being sold out everywhere. Short term playing stocks is really trick and I would not recommened it.

Also, don't compare yourself to others. Compare yourself to how you acted before. Improve yourself. There is no point to compare with some long term investors with different strategies, mindsets and experiences.

Back to ABNB: They are my late reopening play. I bought them at a similar price point as you did, but only as a small position. I think they are gonna have an insane year with the reopening. I cant even remember the alternative website, so competition is quite low. Their numbers got crushed due to covid, huge upside potential. Landlords already charging huge premiums with increasing demand. People will travel while Covid is not out of this world so they might be looking for something more private than a hotel. However, it's valued at over 100B, so it is already at high valuation levels. I keep my position small. If it drops, I will average down. Although it has shown some significant support at around 174$ among all this correctionw wave, so I dont consider that too likely. What I think is we will see some consolidation over the next couple months, until we see some uptrend towards September/October when Wallstreet realizes everythings booked out at astronomical prices.",DeepSkyAstronaut,9,/r/stocks/comments/msozip/how_to_zoom_out_without_missing_important_news/guvk82z/,0.053,0.853,0.094,0.9725

394,FCF," I foresee significantly higher oil and natural gas prices in the future. Owning additional energy stocks is a way to hedge these increases in prices. Additionally, energy stocks have the highest free cash flow yields of any sectors that I have seen (6-18%). The lack of general interest in this sector has led to lower price/FCF and price/book ratios. The energy sector is one of the few sectors that is still below pre-COVID levels, despite higher oil prices than shortly before COVID. 

Some investors may be concerned about a peak in oil demand within the next decades. Oil demand is projected to be about that of 2015 levels in 2050 in most base case scenarios. If oil demand peaks that should not make oil prices drop significantly, as the continual drop in supply of ~5% per year will require continual reinvestment, which will only occur at higher marginal barrel prices. Marginal barrel prices for tight oil investment in the Permian may be about ~$45/barrel now, but drilling inventory in the U.S. is running low and tight oil will soon no longer be able to make up for falling conventional oil production around the world.",cjkubx1066,1,/r/stocks/comments/mss6aa/why_did_you_guys_decide_to_invest_into_individual/guvl9gq/,0.086,0.861,0.052,-0.5994

But I’m also not concerned because I believe that most of the individual positions are solid companies with long term track records. I’ll obviously keep an eye on them over the years but I can sleep at night because I’m not too heavy into any more speculative positions and what not.

So, you can certainly do both, but just understand that depending on what individual positions you own may dictate whether your tilting more toward investing or gambling.",NativeTxn7,1,/r/stocks/comments/mss6aa/why_did_you_guys_decide_to_invest_into_individual/guvuhzg/,0.006,0.919,0.074,0.936
401,GME," Unless you have more money than others will see in their entire lifetime, i find investing in S&P500 directly really stupid.

If you have frontal lobe development, which most redditors in masses doesn't have, you can beat it.

But when we talk about various passive index funds and etfs, then its a good question. 

I will add to it that the most underrated thing about invidual stock investing is the experience you gain. Losing money, winning money, out right being confused plenty times, you can read as much courses and books as you want, but none of it can really make you experience how it is actually like to be out there and do it.

That said experience led me to be there, jump in on GME at 40$ and make hilariously ridiculous amount of money, other times it lets me get some seriously free money from bounces or momentums. Sure one could say its always risking money, but by end of the day many of my plays had nothing to do with excessive intelligence, just enough knowledge to know how to scoop up some free money, and that free money almost always beats directly investing into S&P500.

 However the arm deal comes out, nVidia is going to pop, either because the uncertainty goes away, or because both the uncertainty goes away and nVidia gets to own ARM. Even if there are anti-monopoly provisions added to the deal, which is very likely to get European approval, it would still be a win.

nVidia doesn't need to own ARM in order to make ARM-based server chips, either.

I'm not really sure why they're trying to buy it, except that If nVidia starts making AI chips with specialized cores, and they take off any huge way, then they'll save a little bit on cost. But there's literally nothing stopping them now from licensing technology from ARM and modding it to make those same chips.

502,AMD," 1. You don't buy ATM leaps, they're the most expensive relative to intrinsic value and ""real"" extrinsic value.
2. You pay interest on margin.
3. You become the broker's bitch. They have full control over the margin requirements, and they're fully within their right to raise margin requirements at their own discretion.
4. You can't ""hold"" past dips because you're forced out of your position.
5. Nothing stops you from getting leaps on margin lol

I could go on, but fundamentally you gotta remember that there's no free lunch. If the broker is willing to give you 5x the leverage, he probably has a reason that probably works against you. 

Also, your math is wrong. You're taking into account only intrinsic value, while often times extrinsic is the most profitable part of the process. If you buy that 82 AMD call today, and it goes up to 85, your option will not be $300 more expensive, it'll be more like 600-800 because of extrinsic.",Niev,0,/r/stocks/comments/msml56/buy_leaps_or_buy_underlying_with_x5_leverage_20/gutj6mx/,0.068,0.802,0.13,0.8885

504,SA,"  In addition to reading the wiki and posts in r/dividends , read the following books:  [http://www.mhinvest.com/files/pdf/SBI\_Single\_Best\_Investment\_Miller.pdf](http://www.mhinvest.com/files/pdf/SBI_Single_Best_Investment_Miller.pdf)Stocks for the Long Run, and The Future For Investors, both by   Jeremy   Siegel;    Dividends Still Don't Lie, by Kelley Wright, and The Ultimate Dividend Playbook, by Josh  Peters.   (for the process,  not recommendations for actual stocks to  buy today)

Also read the three articles about ""Chowder"" posted here for ideas on how to select and manage such a portfolio: [https://dgiforthediy.com/resources/](https://dgiforthediy.com/resources/)He  has 2 blogs and some articles posted on Seeking Alpha, one  tracking  a  ""Young  Folk's"" portfolio and the other an ""Old Folks."" He  stopped   updating them last month when Seeking Alpha started removing  moderation   tools from bloggers, but he does still comment there in other  dividend-related blogs. Also note that while SA is locking down articles  now,  blog posts are (supposed to be) still freely accessible.

There are also good articles here, particularly by David Van Knapp and Mike Nadel: [https://dailytradealert.com/](https://dailytradealert.com/)  and [https://dividendsandincome.com/](https://dividendsandincome.com/)

One of the best tools for researching dividend-paying stocks is the U.S. vidend Champion spreadsheet posted here (top of the left column): [https://www.dripinvesting.org/Tools/Tools.asp](https://www.dripinvesting.org/Tools/Tools.asp)

While  using it in your due diligence to select what companies to partner with   don't forget parameters like financial strength (credit rating) of    BBB+  or better.  For even more confidence, only look at those that    have  increased their dividends for over 12 years, which covers the last   long recession.

514,BAC," BAC will perform the poorest of the big banks in the next 12-18 months from my perspective--you have options if you want to keep bank exposure:

JPM: Highly diversified, probably the safest of the big banks to invest in.

Citi: Consumer banking and credit exposure, high potential upside (it hasn't reached pre-covid levels yet).

Goldman: Trading and iBanking exposure, traditionally outperforms.

Morgan Stanley: Similar profile to Goldman, but also a potential Wealth Management play. High risk given the runup post-acquisitions and the uncertainty around how eTrade will contribute to the bottom line.

I don't think you can go wrong with any of those four depending on what you think will outperform and what your timeline looks like. I don't personally like WFC, but that's a play if you have extremely high risk tolerance.

MSFT is a very safe play and has tremendous upside in the longer term, especially bullish because they've really ratcheted up their M&A offensive in the last ~5 years and learned from their Skype mistakes. I'd pour money into MSFT over every bank if you're well diversified, but might steer you away if you're already heavily overweight in MSFT/Tech

529,BAC, Just to diversify and minimize risk. I love my tech but its important to keep assets across various sectors. What if we see tech take a hit like we did in March. In March tech was going down but the rest of the market was doing good including financials. BAC is a pretty stable stock but if you wanna sell because you feel like its overvalued rn thats up to you. If you do I would not put the money in tech especially if you are already heavy in it.,JRshoe1997,3,/r/stocks/comments/mshhnu/switch_bac_for_msft_or_arkf/guso19y/,0.015,0.749,0.236,0.9711

537,RSI," Ok, suppose that it's the predictor of all evil, then why look at the RSI of Russell 2000 over SPY. Because you know that there's no case when you take a look at RSI on SPY. For example, take a look at February 04, RSI of 71. Traded sideways for a couple weeks, before going into a long bull run from $100 to $150 over the next 3 years. Look at another example, RSI indicated overbought in 1995, 1996, 1997,1998. If you listened to RSI then, you wouldve missed out on SPY at $50, which was never seen again, while also missint SPY at $70 and SPY at $91.

540,RVI," The story is still the exact same. At each point, SPY was considered overbought, like SPY at $87 and SPY at $110. As another example, it indicated overbought on October 2017 when SPY traded at $259, just before the run-up to $288, and is trading inside the range even now. That is all while looking at the weekly candles. It's very easily to make that number seem higher than it is using the monthly candlesticks, because looking at the Russell 2000 on the weekly candlesticks, the RVI is actually sitting at the midpoint",Traditional_Fee_8828,1,/r/stocks/comments/msqgu9/russel_2000_historical_volatility_swings_getting/guuqwr8/,0.0,0.933,0.067,0.6697

What about a company that has returned 3% for the last 10 years?  Would you seriously think about owning it?

$4.54B debt
-$250M cash flow

And negative returns!
The only way they are paying a dividend is through debt either directly or leveraging future equity.

567,ANY," Many in this thread is wrong. You can borrow from your IRA for a first time homebuyer whether Roth or not. There is no penalty for a Roth because it’s after tax dollars. The house has to be your primary residence & not have bought a home within 3 years. I forgot how soon, if at all, you need to put the $ back. 
However in a ‘self directed IRA’ you can take the funds without ANY tax or penalty & invest in real estate as an investment property but you & nobody you know can live there",Gr000vy,1,/r/stocks/comments/mse3wy/investing_in_roth_ira_for_house_down_payment/gusc3q3/,0.066,0.918,0.016,-0.5583
568,IRS," The best answer would be  from the IRS. Scroll down in the link to where it says Early Distributions/ Exceptions/ First Home. Remember, tax law can change at anytime, so what is true today may not be true three years from now.[https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en\_US\_2020\_publink1000230922](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b#en_US_2020_publink1000230922)",inkslingerben,1,/r/stocks/comments/mse3wy/investing_in_roth_ira_for_house_down_payment/guwbqib/,0.0,0.791,0.209,0.8841
569,IMO," > Also - it’s worth noting - that it’s extremely risky to put $200,000 for a down payment you need in three years into the stock market. Particularly when the S&P and NASDAQ are at or near all time highs. I’m not saying it’ll go down for sure - but I’m also saying in a short time frame (and 3 years is a short time frame in investing terms) - you have no clue what will happen.

What’s the risk in setting a trailing stop loss on your investments so you can take advantage of higher gains in the stock market while insulating yourself from major losses? I mean, sure, they’re a chance the market tanks from 100-0 out of absolutely nowhere, but it’d never be an instantaneous thing in reality. 

Worst case you have your trailing stop loss at -5% and it initiates the market sell at -10% or something. I mean, that sounds bad until you realize that your investment grew by 25% in stocks compared to like the 5% you would’ve gained in a high-yield savings account. And I’m being pretty generous with a 5% savings yield lol. 

The major risk IMO is that the market crashes within a few months of you investing, before your investment has really had time to grow. I definitely acknowledge that risk, but 1) major crashes don’t exactly happen all that often, and 2) you can adjust your stop losses as time goes on. Regarding the latter point, that would mean you would have to more actively monitor your account, but it’s definitely a means of insulating some risk. 

At the end of the day, I guess it all comes down to your risk aversion and whether or not your goal is to grow or preserve wealth. When it comes to investing in a house, I understand that you probably just want that money to be safe in a savings account, I guess I personally don’t see investing in stocks *that* risky as long as you have hard risk management rules in place. And keep in mind that while your cash is sitting around in a savings account growing 1% per year, the cost of real estate is probably appreciating at higher rate. When it comes to this particular example, you’re actually steadily *losing* buying power by not investing — there’s hidden costs to even the “safest” of investment vehicles.

Just my 2¢. I would personally still keep a sizable of my savings in a cash account, but I’d rather take a risk on growing some portion of it instead of watching it slowly depreciate due to inflation.",maledin,1,/r/stocks/comments/mse3wy/investing_in_roth_ira_for_house_down_payment/guvbqc1/,0.128,0.747,0.125,-0.1272

Had I held them until today, after splits, that original $1,400 investment would have turned into 5,600 shares worth about $750,000 right now.

I learned that, while you will never go broke taking profit, if you have conviction about a company hold it and see what happens. Especially if you don’t have a huge chunk of funds invested.

That’s one of the reasons I am building a position in RBLX that I plan to hold indefinitely. Not saying it’ll be the next Apple but I think it has a tremendous long term future if they do things the right way.

I'm working on convincing some of the millenials and genx's on my work to set it up without sounding like a man yelling on clouds. 

Watch out for ETFs with high expense ratio. ARKs expense ratio is at 0.7% and most Vanguards are at 0.03%. With compounding interest, after 20-30 years that's a lot of money lost on fees.

585,IMO," I own a whole lot of Overstock (around 100 stock). The bear case is very obvious: Medici ventures and tZero are somewhat of a ""pie-in-the-sky"" proposition, meaning that if they fail in their execution their worth to the overall valuation drops very quickly. That being said, Overstock's price doesn't reflect the inclusion of those two entities fairly IMO so I'm still bullish.

Those calling it trash, I mean no offense but that's just short-sighted. The company has benefited tremendously from the pandemic and if consumers stick with this type of online shopping they could be gaining steam for years ahead. Couple that with the potential of Medici & tZero and I think their current market cap of around $3b represents a lot of upside.",FoodCooker62,1,/r/stocks/comments/msibzn/can_someone_make_a_bear_case_for_overstock_please/gut9d49/,0.044,0.914,0.042,0.2023
586,GME," One of the main purposes of tZero is to provide liquidity for private markets via security tokens. Their platform allows you to make investments in private companies that settle the same day when it traditionally takes weeks. That is a huge advancement. By the end of the year, it will be the only platform that allows you to trade public securities, security tokens, and crypto. And unlike traditional exchanges, it is t+0, so no BS like we all saw with GME.

I can assure you it is not ""trash."" They still need to merge the ATS with the crypto side, which is expected to occur in the next few months. Then they need to get approval to trade public securities which should occur later this year. It's going to be an awesome product once everything comes together.
