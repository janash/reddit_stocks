168,GME," Okay but also Marx is a lot more nuanced than that. The stuff that's Zonday is singing about here most closely resembles what Marx talks about in (the unfortunately unfinished) Capital Volume 2. Understanding Marx and Marxism requires reading more than just the Manifesto.

&#x200B;

The short-ish version of Capital:

Volume 1 is about the operations of industrial capitalism -- how capital-holders exploit the weak negotiating position of individual workers to systematically purchase labor for less than the price of the products of that labor minus the non-labor costs of production. This gradually causes all the money in the system to flow towards capital-holders. This results in a very unstable system, since the wealth gets concentrated in fewer and fewer hands, with everyone else  becoming progressively more impoverished. To quote Tay Zonday:

>Mama economy make me understand  
>  
>All the numbers, why daddy's on a welfare plan  
>  
>Turnin' thirty forty fifty gotta move in with my parents  
>  
>And the stocks go up but the jobs disappear

I like to think of this process through an analogy to astrophysics. Consider the holdings of capitalists as being like stars -- they're gigantic, and because of their gravitational pull they accrete more and more of the matter around them. As the gravitational pull of the big money stockpiles sucks in more and more of the money around them, they eventually turn into money black holes. The largest holdings become ruptures in the fabric of the economy, and money that falls into these ruptures never comes back out.

Okay, so Volume 1 is about how the trick of industrial capitalism: how the simple practice of buying labor for less than the value of products made using it results in money becoming concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. The unfinished volumes 2 and 3 are about *finance* capitalism -- the  tricks that allow the economy to limp along even when the black hole stockpiles of the big capitalists have sucked up all the money in the system. These tricks involve -- as Zonday discusses in his song -- various ways of generating debt, which functions like money, but/and which weakens the negotiating position of people who have to take it on to live. This a) keeps the system running, while b) ensuring that none of the people who work for a living -- the people who actually make the motor move -- can escape serving the big capitalists. This, over time, generates *massive* instability -- but in the short term, and even the middle term, keeps the economy alive.

One big reason that dirty fucking commies and retards alike are excited by the GME weirdness is the sense that it's a sign of cracks developing in the system of debt and control described above: it seems to reveal instability produced by finance capital's strategy of using debt to paper over the problems resulting from like ten people having all the money and everyone else being fucked.

Notice how the rest of the market suddenly lost a ton of value during the first round of the short squeeze, right before robinhood et al shut down peoples' ability to heighten the squeeze by continuing to buy GME. As a dirty fucking commie rather than a retard (though rest assured that I am plenty dumb, just like all you retarded apes) , I kind of think of the GME squeeze as being a sudden and unexpected rupture in the fabric of the economy. When it looked like the big shorts were actually going to have to cover even though there wasn't enough GME stock in the world for everyone to cover, suddenly a new black hole started to open, one that hoovered money *away* from the current big players into the hands of a bunch of retarded apes.

The thing is, capital knows how to defend itself, and is *very interested indeed* in defending itself. When industrial capitalism stops working, finance capitalism steps in. When finance capital stops working (whoops, all the money in the market is draining into one stupid  meme stock!) then naked force steps in: capital uses its control over the market and the state to change the rules of the game and thereby paper over the hole they accidentally punched in the economy by overshorting GME.

The willingness of capitalists to use naked force to maintain their positions is why, the farther left you get, the more likely you are to find people who are *very interested indeed* in buying and learning to use guns.

169,AMZN," I'm not sure if the responses would get buried in a sub like this but I'll expand a little for you.

An economy is only as robust and risk averse as its form of protection. 

Globalism and the interconnected nature of things is acceptable- in fact it is actually a stupendous advancement that has paved the way to raising more people out of poverty across the globe than has ever before been recorded in human history. However, I want to highlight with the largest fucking highlighter than humanity has ever wielded that the continued domestic success of globalism relies almost entirely on the protection of the domestic cost and value of labour. Strong labour policy is synonymous with strong economic policy. Don't get that twisted however, don't let the phrase ""labour value"" get lost in artificial platitudes like ""just raise the minimum wage"". Much- if not all the modern forms of labour protectionism are just proxies for ""money printer go brr"" and oversimplifications designed to protect economic hegemony. ""Strong labour policy"" is certainly a large catch-all that I am absolutely over simplifying, so read the rest of this with that in mind. 

Genuine labor protectionism is a dinosaur conversation in modern economic circles because much of the policy associated with it has been demonised by neo-liberals and bastardised by career politicians who coat it in shitty dogma and abrasive nationalism. Strong labour policy is *not anti-immigrant*. Strong labour policy is essential to preserving the upwards mobility potential that is supposed to be offered in a free market capitalist system. This applies to everyone- including immigrants and is at the centre of the quintessential definition of the American Dream. It is a shame of proportions so gargantuan that I could not even begin to capture in words the fact that the most relevant and coherent labour protectionism policy of the last three decades came packaged with someone who was so patently toxic that the risks outweighed the benefits.  

The solution is not a stimulus package and it certainly is not more disconnected economic platitudes that do nothing to restore the economic foundation of the labour market itself. Labour doesn't magically become more valuable because the government has mandated a new minimum wage. The same thing can be said about student loan forgiveness. Your total economic buying power doesn't change simply because your loans are paid off. This can only be a true statement if you believe that trickle down economics actually trickles down. The only thing these policies do is speed up the transfer of wealth from the lower brackets and the government to the top who are already shielded from risk by existing policy they themselves have lobbied to create.  

A really good example of this is when Amazon was pressured to raise their minimum wage a few years back. [Amazon raised the minimum wage for all their jobs across the US to roughly 15 dollars per hour](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/03/amazon-hourly-workers-lose-monthly-bonuses-stock-awards.html#:~:text=Amazon%20confirmed%20in%20an%20email,the%20loss%20in%20other%20benefits.). Now while this may look like a net positive at first for the workers. It's actually a move by amazon to disconnect the cost of their labour from the value of the company because they gained a 15 dollars minimum wage but lost[ monthly bonuses and stock options.](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/03/amazon-hourly-workers-lose-monthly-bonuses-stock-awards.html#:~:text=Amazon%20confirmed%20in%20an%20email,the%20loss%20in%20other%20benefits.) Now this took place almost three years ago, when the price of AMZN was around 1,100 dollars.  With a quick glance at what the price is doing now...well that explains itself.

219,EV," I actually sincerely think it’s the options factor that is the main factor in the GameStop squeeze that actually makes it scarier than Volkswagen— which we saw with the first big squeeze which I think WAS actually bigger than VW’s. 

Everyone talks about naked shorting but I don’t actually believe it is all naked shorting, which is mostly illegal and would require a whole lot of big institutions being complicit. But naked shorting isn’t actually as dangerous as

Naked calls. 

There’s a reason every single glossary states that naked calls have UNLIMITED risk and in my absolutely stupid estimation, it’s precisely what’s at play here. Someone did the math and figured that in actuality it’s more likely the float is about 400% shorted. That’s not crazy if it’s because of naked calls. There was even that one guy who gloated about selling a whole bunch of naked calls on that 800 strike— when GameStop in the first squeeze went ultraparabolic, I guarantee you it’s not because of just purely hedgie shorters— it was naked call sellers thinking they were taking advantage of massive IV on what seemed like a no brainer play. Remember that guy who LOST like millions on that and went bankrupt and sued DFV? 

Short interest INCLUDES itm calls from what I’ve read. That makes everything make a lot of sense when you take it all in aggregate. 

I’ve been playing this thing since September and I do really dumb shit but doing my really dumb shit has shown me what I think is basically a squeeze hack— I exercise early. Like months early sometimes. Cuz I wheel to recoup lost EV. And what I’ve noticed is when I exercise early it always fucks me— because every time I exercise early, the price LEAPS. Even just one tiny call, and every time the price will jump. I’ve done it every squeeze (even the many smaller ones before the big one) and it’s happened every time. Am I unlucky?

No. 

I’m fucking a naked call seller who’s probably fucking someone else who’s probably fucking someone else. At that level of short interest there’s multiple levels of leverage at play so my tiny call exercise is causing some kind of chain reaction. 

If anyone reading this has some itm calls, even if it’s an April expiry, they should just TRY it. And maybe everyone does it exactly at 12pm EST right as the mm’s start their lunchtime coke parties.

>IN FEBRUARY THIS year, Michigan-based entrepreneur Robert Simpson decided to see what would happen if he bought the entire stock of one company. Using a single broker, within a couple of days Simpson had paid a little over $5,000 for 1,285,050 shares in OTC bulletin board property-development company Global Links. According to Simpson, these shares were delivered into his account shortly afterwards. Yet the following day 37,044,500 Global Links shares were traded on the bulletin board. The next day, 22,471,000 shares were traded. On neither day had Simpson traded a single Global Link share, he insists.

>And events surrounding Simpson's investments became yet more confusing. Global Links had only ever issued 1,158,064 shares. Simpson had managed to acquire 126,986 shares that did not exist. How he had managed to be sold more shares than were in issuance is exactly the question Simpson hoped his foray would raise.

>Simpson is CEO of OTC bulletin board company Zann Corp, a provider of advanced technology products for niche markets, and has experienced an inexplicable excess shares situation over the past two-and-a-half years. Since November 2003, Zann's stock price has plummeted over 98%. This, Simpson claims, makes no sense since his company has performed relatively well. The reason for this extreme underperformance, Simpson believes, is that his company has been subject to severe naked short selling – where stocks are short sold without having been borrowed before the time of settlement, if at all.

also, GME to the fucking ort cloud!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


*Dear Senator Booker,*

*I hope this message finds you and your family well and happy.*

*In light of the upcoming hearings, below is an investigative journal piece on the practice of naked short selling and its detrimental effects on the free market. Specifically, how the recent market saga surrounding the publicly traded firm Gamestop and the Wall Street firms that at one point shorted over 140% of the company's stock, exposed glaring corruption and regulatory capture of the SEC by Wallstreet elites.*

*The same also highlights an immensely lucrative political opportunity to reform the very industry directly responsible for the suffering of millions of your constituents.*

*As a long time voter and constituent as well as a retail investor, I was recently personally affected by the issues raised therein. Although the total sum of my very modest investment amounted to a drop in the proverbial bucket, for a lower middle-class 30 something every dollar counts. Alas, I am reaching out in the hopes that the issue is brought to the attention of the Senate and new administration at large so that changes can be made at the Securities and Exchanges Commission. A thorough investigation must be conducted as to why the SEC has failed to implement the very rules it created to prevent this very practice from taking place.* 

*Perhaps more importantly, a larger discussion should be held as to whether the existing fine and penalty structure imposed by the SEC as punishment for the despicable behavior of unscrupulous hedge funds and financial institutions is sufficient to deter the behavior. As it stands, the SEC fines amount to merely a cost of doing business no different than the cost of rent for their office space. This is completely against the spirit of the agency's mission and begs the question of how much regulatory capture has taken place since the 2008 Great Recession. It's disheartening to think after all that misery, we're still in the same place.*

*Senator, Inequality is at the root of every single problem we face as a State and as a nation. It is my sincere belief that our socio economic problems will only get worse if we fail to address the regulatory capture of the institutions charged with protecting the average American and setting the boundaries for our values as a society.*

*However, if you and your colleagues are willing, you have the unprecedented opportunity to make meaningful change to the status quo and create a political momentum that will reverberate to all other sociopolitical causes you and I really care about.*

*I will continue voting for you and candidates like you so long as you keep this mission at the forefront of everything you do.*

*Thank you for all your hard work and all you do to make my State a better one Senator Booker.*

Anything he does will seem natural and he'll avoid any sort of accusations of market manipulation.

Edit 2: So our Class A shares do have voting rights. That's good. 

The only thing I could think of on how to call in a vote is for a proposal related to their push towards E-commerce over traditional Brick & Mortar stores. Maybe, Something along the lines of increased transparency or a proposal to limit the amount of physical locations that can be closed over a given time period. Maybe, Something that limits their pay or bonus to the percentage of revenue generated by e-commerce versus in-store purchases.

EDIT 2: to answer the perfect question of ""what is too painful to maintain?"" By u/mookanana

You are right, they are forced to hold their short position until they can buy out or the shorted company goes bankrupt.

Bankruptcy of GME is what the shorters were banking on, as if they go bankrupt then there is both no tax to pay and the shorter doesn't have to buy the shares, so triple profit. This requires the collusion of the clearing house or broker, and if they think the bankruptcy is a certainty then where is the harm in allowing phantom shares? Because if it goes under there is nothing to answer for.

But we fucked that up for them by calling their bluff.
They thought nobody liked the stock.

So the shorters have to hold or sell.
But holding shorts incurs interest, usually prime+2%, so they are heamoraging cash with each day that passes.
Their bosses are only going to allow that to go on for so long.


It's like they tried to kill an animal by sticking their arm in it's throat until it suffocates and dies, but we're the animals teeth, and every held share is a tiny cut to their arm and they're slowly bleeding, and the animal is still breathing.

275,GME," So I looked into why Mark Cuban cares about the whole event at all.

I recently saw that a hedge fund Maverick Capital has been very public about their support of the GME madness and had increased their stake to 7% of GME shares. They are now the sixth largest shareholder of GME. I started wondering if Mark Cuban and Maverick Capital are connected.

So the Founder of Maverick Capital is Evan Wyly, who also happens to own the Texas Legends, the minor league team that feeds into the Mavs, which Mark Cuban owns. It turns out that Mark Cuban and Even Wyly are best friends!!! So Mark Cuban literally gave us a playbook of how to win his friend a shit ton of money!

Edit: I don't believe that Billionaires want the little guy to win without some ulterior motive. This is that motive and gives legitimacy to the playbook that Mark Cuban gave during his AMA.

Here is the link to Maverick Capitals 13G filing from Q4  2/16/21. They hold 4.66M shares of GME, or 6.7%.

Ergo, the second they start to lose some money they’ll just panic sell. I’m not entirely sure if this is the short squeeze we’ve all been waiting for but outside of some funky fresh short squeeze even with digitization and an org restructure GME is not likely to hit the $1000 mark anyyyyytime soon.

301,REAL," EDIT: I spent all this time writing this then the thread was locked so this has nothing to do with anything

I'd like to see a maximum wage. 

I was on board with a transaction tax, because I could see how it would affect HFT/hedge traders more than retail, and that would be a win for the common working class retard trying to elevate his status in the capitalist system he lives in. 

But then someone pointed out how they'd just use ""dark pools"" and other witchery to get around the tax, continue to play the game at an advantage, and nothing would change except a tax that inordinately hits the retail trader. 

I don't know what I think about that though. It's all so fucking complicated. But I do know that it's *vital* that a Bob Belcher type person has equal access to the markets as any kajillionaire. Unrealistic? Probably. But we need to at least *aim* for it. 

The single most powerful tool we have to elevate our status in this system is by utilizing our capital, and that's being denied to us, in the rules of the markets, and I'd even argue in the systemic failure of public education.

525,GME," Hedgefunds short sold Gamestop- shorting being the process of borrowing shares of a stock, and then selling them with the promise of buying it at a later date to return to the original lender; you're gambling that the stock at the point of re-purchase is less expensive than when you bought it, so you can pocket the difference- which in itself is normal.


What makes this unusual was a collection of factors- first and formost being that the market disagreed with professional assessments that Gamestop was on it's way out. Hedge funds shorted GME to an unreal amount, too. As in, not real- they shorted so much that there would have to be an exchange of more shares of GME than there was in existence. And that's where the devil's bargain comes in- while you can make some good money gambling on shorts, your losses are also only restrained by a stock's ability to grow in value. 


Now, when a short is squeezed, that simply means that the stock grew in value relative to an expected trend produced by shorting. When you've shorted so hard that you start sharting, you now have a situation where there's about 50 million shares of GME stock and something like 200 million shares that will have to exchange hands. 


And the fine terms of a short sale is that regardless of face value, you must buy back that stock, meaning that by merit of there being so much shorting, the short sharts itself because the act of shorting has now *driven up* the value of the stock. That's also called a gamma squeeze.",AliveRich40,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lskaxp/wallstreetbets_vs_wallstreet_short_squeeze_round_2/gosvzoa/,0.024,0.846,0.13,0.9757

527,GME," Bond yields are going up so I'm guessing the big bois' computer algorithms triggered a liquidation of equity positions en masse and moved money to bonds/fixed income securities. Those same algorithms are likely programmed to not only expect the equity -> fixed income security exodus created by their behavior, but also explicitly designed to capitalize on the resulting discounts in stock prices across the board. They'll likely assign a favorable rationality to the recent irrational GME behavior and make purchases.

560,HAS," I mean, at one point someone has to put an end to it. Otherwise its infinite money. There is no limit to how much money you can lose on shorts, while there is a limit of how much money you can lose on longs.   
You buy a long stock, so the value is fixed and you can only lose what you put in.   
You dont buy a short stock, you borrow it and sell it instantly, a some point you buy it back, give it back to the ones you borrowed it from and have made a quick profit. However, since a stock can rise in value, that means you can lose money, and there is no hard cap on how much something can be worth. There is literally infinite potential if you lose shorts. Since you borrowed the stock, the broker can demand stocks back, because it's their stock and it may have increased in value so they want to sell it themselves, meaning you are forced to buy the stock and give it back. Now legally, there are some bankrupcy laws that are put in place, so that a broker cannot demand the shorter everything back at once if that could lead to bankrupcy, but the broker does have a right to his own produce.

Since its limitless, there HAS to be someone to end it. Either through declaring money to have failed as a payment system, making money worthless, through excusing the remaining debt by gifting away the shorts to, in this case, the hedgefund or through constantly inflating money, again making money worthless.  
Since excusing the debt is the only logical outcome in the long term without making money worthless, eventually this will come to an end. The debt is Melvin Capital towards brokers and it has to be paid through stocks, which they have to buy at some point. All we're doing is buying it much earlier and offering it at increased prices.",predated0,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsze3f/see_how_the_rich_lose_money_and_now_want_to/gov99wo/,0.125,0.83,0.045,-0.9804

573,GM," Swaps weren’t allowed for a long time. This changed, I believe, in 1999. 

TRS are a derivative. (So are options... so are swaps). 

CDOs hold bonds etc and are cut up into tranches and sold. Funds did this when GM and car manufacturers were in trouble (think 2005). Bonds went to high yield (junk) and had to be sold by pensions and companies who couldn’t hold junk. Funds bought up the bonds, added millions in cash, and cut up the new CDO into tranches (0-3, 3-7, etc). These tranches are given AAA or whatever by S&P or Moody’s or whoever. These AAA securities can now be owned by the pensions etc despite them being nearly the same thing except at a higher price extracted from the working person and scooped up by fund managers. 

You can trade a CDS with the underlying being a CDO. This was done by many companies and got some in trouble as some CDOs were designed to fail on purpose. 

TRS are synthetic exposure to an underlying position. You are swapping one position for another using a contract. 

I may be also seeing things a little differently than others on here. I mean, if you were to pay me 3% or something for long exposure to, let’s say, $KOSS. So I give you the exposure / return as if you owned 100 shares, you know what I’m going to do? I’m going to go out and buy 100 shares of $KOSS. Why? Because what if it goes to the moon? I’ll be left holding the bag and be out a lot of money. If I buy the shares, when it goes to the moon, I sell, and then pocket the 3%. By owning the underlying of the swap, it’s a way to lock in profit (3%) regardless of what the position actually does. So they are merely disguising the perpetrator of the behavior (and avoiding the disclosure requirements as said above).

&#x200B;

Also with block chain, you dont have to make everything completely anonymous like they do with wallets. All wallets will have to register with a central database, just like any other person in the market does today with registering with the SEC when they want to participate in the market.

If the hedge funds want to try and hide their trades with block chain technology by disbursing their trades from 1000 individual accounts instead of 1, those 1000 accounts still have to be registered and a name attached.

596,USA," You don't need any kind of lite conspiracy like that. The american dream may have been true once, when the country was new and everything was yet to be built. It didn't matter much if you were intelligent or skilled, when a country is born anew in a place where nothing did exist before, everything is to be done: houses, roads, railroads, sewage, buildings, companies, whatever. There wasn't anything at all over there. In Europe everything already existed because it was built throughout millennia, so if course there were few jobs for the poor, illiterate or unskilled.

Once the USA acquired, and even surpassed, the standards of living of Europe, and capitalism was set to roam free, the american dream died. You can't no longer get rich by shining shoes at times square, because there are 200 hundred people doing that. You can't ascend in the social ladder by being a clerk at a 7/11, because 16 year old kids who want a car will get that job and accept 4 dollars an hour. And you can't open a competing store to that 7/11 because you can't pay the lease of a shop over there. Neither can't that 7/11, by the way, they just keep it open losing money in that particular spot so no competitor can arise made be popular. That store is a giant marketing operation: it loses money every month, but they gain exposure.

599,MC," I mean, right now it would be a complete loss of money to not be daytrading on days that Melvin Capital is forced to pay back unless you're already rich enough that money no longer matters.

So on long term, holders will increase, meaning the value will increase aswell. If Melvin Capital is smart, they will also buy shares a few hours before they have to cover shorts, because then they can quickly sell a lot of shares for a profit to minimize their monthly losses long-term. Which makes this process even more long term, making this a very long term profit for a lot of people untill Melvin Capital declares bankrupcy or somehow manages to sell off all the shorts in time. Last time they ""only"" had to pay about 50$ per short. Now they have to pay about 90$ per short. They would want to sell as many shorts as possible now so they will lose less money over time. The more and more people realize they will be forced to pay, the more and more people will join in.

I dont believe it will be infinite because there is a hard cap of shorts that need to be returned and there will probably be someone being nice enough to excuse MC as to not break the market as the shorts have paid back over 10000 fold at that time.

Because the owners, the owners of this country don't want that. I'm talking about the real owners now, the BIG owners! The Wealthy… the REAL owners! The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.

Forget the politicians. They are irrelevant. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice! You have OWNERS! They OWN YOU. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They’ve long since bought, and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls.

They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying,  lobbying, to get what they want.  Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I'll tell you what they don’t want: 

They don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don’t want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested in that. That doesn’t help them. Thats against their interests.

Thats right. They don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table and think about how badly they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They don’t want that!

You know what they want? They want obedient workers. Obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork. And just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shitty jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it, and now they’re coming for your Social Security money. They want your retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street, and you know something? They’ll get it. They’ll get it all from you sooner or later cause they own this fucking place! It's a big club, and you ain’t in it!  You, and I, are not in the big club.

By the way, it's the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long beating you over the head with their media telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy. The table has tilted folks. The game is rigged and nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care! Good honest hard-working people; white collar, blue collar it doesn’t matter what color shirt you have on. Good honest hard-working people continue, these are people of modest means, continue to elect these rich cock suckers who don’t give a fuck about you….they don’t give a fuck about you… they don’t give a FUCK about you.

They don’t care about you at all… at all… AT ALL.  And nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. Thats what the owners count on.

650,DD," Hey guys just real quick I want to point something out/discuss.

We keep repeating this sentiment that the bots/shills from Melvin are these obvious idiots telling us to sell, that we're gonna be left bag holding, etc etc.

These hedge funs have lost billions now. Do you *really* think they'd only spend a couple thousand bucks hiring and paying people to make such low effort comments? 

The smart move on their part would be to flood us with tons of low effort comments so we *think* that's all they're doing, meanwhile make posts that seem like legit DD to get us to expect a squeeze today, or a certain share price (cough, $800, cough) to happen today so that if that *doesn't* happen today we'll see a huge sell off of paper handed apes at the end of the day who don't want to hold into after hours and over the weekend.

We really need to keep bringing up that absolutely nothing may happen today and that even a dip might happen. We need to remember that we may also shoot to $800+ and that if that happens they may have started that price idea or spread it around because they figure if they can get people to start selling there it will drive the price down rapidly again.

We don't know what their game is. But we do know they love money and do you *really* think they'd only be spending a pittance on trying to throw us off our game with these bots/shills that take no effort?

717,RUN," POURING IN MONEY THAT YOU CAN'T DO WITHOUT COULD DOOM US IN THE LONG RUN. BET CAREFULLY.

Betting money that you can't afford to lose just plays into the hands of the hedge funds. It means you're susceptible to being scared into selling early. If you can say ""screw it, I'm holding no matter what,"" you're dangerous. If your business/house/family/savings are at stake, you can be scared into selling early to either take a loss, or jumping at the chance to take a small profit and missing out on bigger gains down the road. If you start panic selling, it can start a cascade that bails them out. 


Throwing everything into the breach sounds heroic, but hedge funds have a large number of tools to drag things out and threaten you. By only wagering what you can afford to kiss goodbye - not that any of us knows how to kiss - you take away a large portion of their power.

Love the self deprecating jokes and the commitment to the noble cause of taking down the hedgies and their bs naked shorts. Been a casual trader for ~20 years - my dad taught me everything he knew starting when I was a kid. He's passed now, but he fucking HATED how brokerages fuuuuck over the little guy investor, and instilled that hatred in me. As I grew up and got more astute at investing, he and I developed a strategy of finding deep value, buying, and holding (often for years). That strategy ultimately paid off all my university debt. Here I am decades later finding a community with a similar approach, and an even greater resolve. Now I'm part of this vietnam-style guerilla war against the metaphorical american invader shorts. We're poorly trained, poorly funded, but have a singular purpose and a clear and simple marching order that will win: Buy. Hold. Repeat.

733,GME," Important to understand the possible chain of effects : 

There’s huge volume of calls, almost all the way to the fucking gigantic firework factory that is the 52k 800$ calls. Just from 100$ to 300$, if they are ITM, market makers have to find 7 million shares, yup, ~14% of the float, that’s a rough calculation based on the biggest volumes, it’s even more than that, and just this Friday, not the other week calls.

What does it mean? Market makers will eat each other’s alive to find the lowest priced shares if we rocket up, on an already anemic float. 

God speed y’all! Been an amazing adventure.


I’ll copy someone’s already done numbers yesterday, I’m on cell phone, too hard to pull out an excel :

Call options exp tmrw:

•	⁠800c volume= 52,112

•	⁠200c volume = 30,179

•	⁠300c= 16,034

•	⁠150c= 15,907

•	⁠100c= 9,573

•	⁠50 to 100 = 34,333 total

*sort by volume: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME

So yea, 100 to 300$, just the big whales, not the in-between: ~7.1M shares


Edit : ok, had time to excel this shit. 

From 100$ to 300$, 16.15M shares, (turns out the in between strike prices adds up), 35.85% of the float!

1016,BOOM," Am I wrong or is there a major difference in SELLING and EXERCISING options.  Back on 2/17/2021 the interview with Thomas Peterffy, he talks about how close we got to the ""collapse"" or basically the squeeze. 

1.5 M calls = 1.5M shares were open (his statement), he says that if those calls ere EXERCISED the brokers are obligated and ""must... MUST by their rules of the system go into the market and buy the shares of any price. Pushing the price into the thousands"".  A major difference that I think everyone is missing is that by selling your options, you are selling the contracts, not the shares. Everyone EXERCISING options would give you ownership of shares and BOOM,  squeeze.  


Take DFV as an example. We know he has 100K shares and 500 April 16th calls.  500 x 100 = 50,000 additional shares to his position if he exercises rather than sells.

1023,DD," I believe that end of March will be when the squeeze will start. If the Q1 2021 earnings beat the expectations, there is a high chance it will be game over for the hedgies. 

Also, all that hype and noise around GME  is providing a LOT of publicity for the company. Many people who might have not heard or paid attention to GameStop as a store, now see it as the symbol of hope against HF thieves and might be willing to go shop there more often. 

Good marketing can have a huge impact on sales. And the best is that it was completely free for Gamestop. Companies would spend big $$$ for the fraction of publicity GME has right now. 

I believe that GME is benefiting from this technique used a lot in marketing:   [The Consumer Psychology Trick Behind Repetition in Brand Storytelling](https://www.skyword.com/contentstandard/the-consumer-psychology-trick-behind-repetition-in-brand-storytelling/)

Also, just by looking at the number of people posting their purchases of items from Gamestop, it leads me to believe that more people are going to buy things from Gamestop. Which in theory should push their earnings higher than anticipated.

Now I am not sure when the estimated EPS were calculated for the last time but if the forecast was done prior to 2021, surely it didn't take into account all the publicity around GME in the last few months.  Right now the EPS it's at 1.35, last year Q1 was 0.79 estimate and 1.27 actual. So in 2019 Gamestop reached 1.27 EPS without the amount of hype they have now. It leads me to believe that 1.35 will be easily beaten. (Yes I know COVID and lockdown and stuff)

[GameStop Reports 2020 Holiday Sales Results | Gamestop Corp.](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-2020-holiday-sales-results) shows a 3.1% decrease but if we take into account all the lockdowns and restrictions during the pandemic, 3.1% is surprisingly low for a retail store. In comparison, the e-comm sales went up 309%.

so, I am looking forward to Q1 2021 with high expectations about earnings and the short squeeze. Hopefully, their earnings beat expectations and shock the hedgies into triggering the MOASS.

Now, I am not as experienced as other people who do in-dept DD so I might be missing facts or misinterpreting information, or be too biased. Please feel free to correct me.

This is just my view of the market and another reason why hedgies are YOLO-ing so much in the past month. They probably know a reversal for Gamestop as a company is starting with Q1 2021 and their time is running out.

They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.

1068,GME," Didn't we learn last time?

The reported short data does not include dark pools - shares held and shorted off exchange between parties (banks, funds etc.)

The narrative of they've run out of legitimate shorts and it's all synthetic was proven wrong last time when these fucks were able to partially cover or at least kick the can down the road and keep shorting.

I'm not saying fuckery isn't afoot - it clearly is. And I'm not saying none of this short volume is coming from synthetic shares. I'm also not supporting the hedge shorts or any of their enablers at the SCC.

But we keep doing this same dance with GME instead of what WSB does(did) best - drafting off the sharks and bending their bullshit to our favour.

These short term surges in price are going to repeat in the near term. This current run is entirely off of: a change in one C-suite position, *a fucking ice cream cone*, and DFV stating he doubled down. That's honestly nothing.

When we get close to financials in April we could have this happen again; when another executive is replaced or board positions are announced; when Cohen's disclosure forms come through and he bought a shit ton of GME. On and on.

Until the regulations are changed to tackle naked shorting, until dark pool trades are disincentivized by the market, until we have accurate and complete reporting from these institutional players, they will continue to have all the tools necessary to run this up and down.

The opportunity for a legendary fuck you move from retail was stolen from us and that was wrong. But we're not going to get another one of those for any number of clear reasons that have been gone over in this sub.

What we *can* get - what we *will* get - are future opportunities to play smart and jump in and out on these pops. Gamma Stop Entertainment will continue to be volatile. Watch your technicals, write covered calls, swing trade, DCA down on your bags. But dont keep looking for reasons to buy and hold out for some day of reckoning when you'll get $1000+ per share.

1072,OCC," > Am I crazy? 

It's very unlikely that you're crazy (though I'm not a medical professional).

But your understanding of exercising call options is not wholly accurate.  If you exercise a call option, your broker doesn't go into the market to buy the stock.  Instead, the OCC (options clearing house) buys the stock for you (at the strike price) from the option seller - this doesn't happen in the market at all, and it has no impact on the stock price.

If you buy a deep out-of-the-money call option that becomes deep-in-the-money due to the stock going up, chances are the seller of the call option has already bought the stock (that they will sell to you as a result of your option being assigned/exercised).",nondubitable,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsvl8k/really_long_dd_and_analysis_what_happened/gouvrdx/,0.069,0.916,0.015,-0.6908

And then the government (probably) bails them out if the clearing house or market makers are hurt enough by it. Someone HAS to bag hold when wealth is transferred.

1159,GME," I see options like below

Imagine the following is written on a paper, lets call it a ticket.

Ticket (contract)

\--------------------------------

Stock: GME

Strike: $150

Acton: SELL

Expires By: Feb/26/2020

Signed By: Seller name

Seller promises to Sell 100 GME stocks at strike price anytime until its expiry date.

\-------------------------------

The one who writes (Seller) it, sells (seller to open) it to a buyer at a premium price (buy to open). Buyer now holds the ticket. Hence buyer has a right to exercise as written in the contract until it expires. And seller is obligated to perform as written in the ticket. This is called CALL option. 

PUT option is same, except the Action is ""BUY"" instead of ""SELL"".

When the buyer wants to sell the ticket to someone, he can do it by sell to close, so another buyer will have rights and previous buyer can move out. Same this goes with seller, he will do a buy to close so that another seller will be obligated.

Basically, people have paid an assload of money for the right (a contract) to buy shares for 800 a share on or before Friday.  Assuming its above 800 by EOD Friday you can buy them for 800 and sell them at the market price.   This is in no way an actual prediction, its a bunch of idiots gambling with the most leverage they could.

1161,ANY," The answer here is twofold. Quick and dirty: 

First and foremost, if the price goes high enough, many of the shorts need to be covered via buying a stock at market price. If no stocks are available, they have to buy the stock at ANY price, i.e. if you're the only retard left with GME and want, say, 100k$ per stock, they HAVE to buy it at 100k$ to cover their position. That's the mechanic behind it.

Secondly, the IB CEO admitted that, without the recent trading stop that halted the last frenzy, the price literally would've gone into the thousands. Yes, as in multiple 1000$ per share. So he confirmed the Hedgefunds risks.

If in a perfect world, GME would still be shorted more than 100% AND not a single investor would sell below 100k$, the price could realistically skyrocket beyond your wildest dreams.

On that same page I look exactly at 17:58 and last sold was $101.16 (but 5535 shares were traded at that time so that's not conclusive) 

Weird how there is a discrepancy within their own site which is both updated. Looking at the trades in the aftermarket, most of them were within range of what we see ($122-$91.71 at up to 4 decimal places). That makes it unlikely that a hedge fund was purchasing at any given price (as iirc, retail cannot trade at 4 decimal places).

I am roaming the WSB discord and one of the biggest things I'm seeing is people saying that GME needs to get to 180 today. I want you guys to realize, this is very much not the case. This thing can last months if not over a year. We have the possibility to make thousands off of a single share and the fact that people don't understand that yet is frightening. If everyone holds, they will have to buy back shares off of us, and when no one sells the price will continue to increase exponentially. We are far from where the price can be and I hope that this post doesn't get removed because I don't want people to be scared. This is a gold mine of an opportunity, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, trust your gut and don't listen to people saying this reality isn't possible.

1280,DD," **Read If You FOMO'd Yesterday:**

TL;DR: HFs have been and are currently artificially inflating the supply through naked shorts and driving the price downward, but will have to cover in the future. Demand will go off the charts and bring the price with it. If you want a better break down check out [wherearetheshares.com](https://wherearetheshares.com/).

I know a month ago, when I made my first investment, I didn't really understand why people liked the stock. I had heard ""short squeeze,"" ""gamma squeeze,"" and retarded shit like that, but even after googling terms, I still had no idea what I was doing. So, for the new investors who invested bc of FOMO yesterday and now have their wife's boyfriend yelling at them for ""wasting all our money,"" here ya go:

Naked short selling pushes supply up over demand by creating essentially counterfeit shares or IOU shares, this is what makes [\~140%](https://www.thestreet.com/mishtalk/economics/naked-shorting-is-illegal-so-how-was-gamestop-140-short) short to float numbers possible. More supply is added into the system, which doesn't recognize the new shares as IOUs, pushing the supply way over demand and driving the price downward. However, because they are in a short position on the stock, they will be forced to buy back the original ”non-IOU” shares at some point in the future. When that happens, the supply will return to normal making the demand go off the charts and driving the price off the charts as well as long as we hold. For now, they can continue to stave off bankruptcy by continuing to sell naked shorts and holding enough capital to cover their margin requirements. But they are losing capital through interest rates which actually just skyrocketed according to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lszyv3/gme_short_fee_up_1500/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on reddit. When their interest rates on shorts break the bank and they get margin called, all those failure to deliver shares as a result of naked shorts will be worthless to HFs, moving supply way under the demand for the stock and sling-shotting us into Saturn’s orbit. In theory, HFs could get away with this predatory investment strategy if they drove the price of a stock to a pennies or getting them delisted, but as Mark Cuban said, “[...this cannot happen here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey_everyone_its_mark_cuban_jumping_on_to_do_an/glqndlx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)”  This was never a get rich quick scheme, this was always a battle of attrition.  How long can hedge funds stay above water? We can hold forever because we don't have to pay interest rates on long positions, so really its a waiting game.  

Take all of this with a grain of salt, I was dumb enough to buy it close to the first peak and Crayola is my favorite kind of cereal. Again, in theory, this is what should happen, but in practice the SEC turns a blind eye to this kind of behavior, often naked short sellers get away without paying taxes on earnings. Only bet, and by all means any investment in this stock is a bet, what you’re willing to lose and don’t do what I did and take advice from strangers on the internet do your own DD, it will make you money some day.

If you are brand spankin new here as of this week. Have doubts. Are **FREAKING OUT** over $50 changes.

__THIS IS FOR YOU__

I have been lurking this page for a long time. I recently created an account and lurked some more back in January. What is happening with GameStop today, yesterday, the day before **has happened before**. All these people you see telling you to hold and laughing this off were here for GME Hell Week. **THESE DIPS AND SPIKES ARE NORMAL** so get your sweaty little grubbers off your broker apps and **RELAX**. Do yourself the favor and go look at all the REAL DD that’s been done. Take in the fact that DFV **DOUBLED DOWN** on his position after making 14M. Every time you see a negative comment on this thread think to yourself “Gosh darn I wonder **WHY** someone would spend their time trying to convince me to sell if they’re so against the stock”. Stop asking dumb questions like “Oh WheNs BlAsToFF?” “ShOuLd I BuY nOw?” “WhY cAnt I bUy AfTer 8pm” Just shut the fuck up. You’re the reason I got off Stocktwits.

If you have shares under $150 **YOU ARE SET UP FOR SUCCESS** there is zero reason to sell. Got it higher? Average down.
All the money you put into this you should treat like is **GONE** till it’s time to sell.

Everybody, i feel this is extremely important information that is being over looked. As a former chik-fil-a employee i am casual expert when it comes to dips and tendies. From experience i can confidently say a 20 piece tendie requires an abosulte MINIMUM of 4 dips, sometimes 6-8. If we reverse this logic we can predict total tendie at the end by looking at dips. For instance if im taking an order and customer says they want 6 chikfil a sauce i assume they are ready to order a 30 piece tendie for the fam. We are going through some major dips and im loving it cause it only means the order of tendies to follow will be MASSIVE",ImaginationNo3962,29,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lt2ay0/gme_megathread_part_2_for_friday_february_26th/gouv19i/,0.0,0.882,0.118,0.9134

Wednesday they buy a bunch of very OTM calls. Then they cover 20 million or so shares. Where did those shares come from? From shorting ETFs with lots of GME

AVGD: averaging down- The lower price goes, the more u can buy with same amount of capital, then u have more total shares at lower average cost per share.

Example by rich retards: Those apes who bought at $40-50 in that low support channel last week just made lots of $gains in last 48 hours.

1522,IMO," Bordering on boomer advice here but IMO don't chase money in the market if you can't afford to lose it. Better to take a loss you can recover from reasonably than to see you made a mistake and then compound it to where you can't clear it up without hurting your life in big ways for an extended period of time. Always learn something from trades and try to position yourself so that one trade doesn't  break you long term. All trades won't be positive dollar trades but they can all be positive long term education trades. That's contrary advice to what you usually get here and YOLOing all you have can be enticing just know what you're getting into and mentally prepare for the consequences of what you choose to do.   


Sounds like you have about $2500 in. Not to minimize your potential loss but even if you're completely broke that can be recovered from in a reasonable amount of time. So while I don't think you should panic I do think you should be smart going forward. You aren't going to lose all of that no matter what. You have to do what works for you individually though so if you need to sell some because you get in a bind then do that. In the meantime start preparing a plan to hustle up what you need to stay afloat in a worst case scenario if worse case scenario here could hurt you badly. Hold what you can and realize that in the long term the stock should see some good days ahead even without crazy squeezes etc. if you do round up funds and it drops to the $30's etc. again that might be worth averaging into IMO if you're looking longer term. But chasing a squeeze that may or may not happen with money you can't afford to lose should probably not be on your menu unless you really understand the risk and are comfortable with the position that would put you in.

But, THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART, I have the money to do that and losing it all won't impact my day-to-day. I won't miss bills or starve because of it. If you can afford to average down if stock dips into double digits again, and you're not gonna miss the money if it goes up in smoke, then knock yourself out.

After reading  Lucy Komisar article on the Prospect. There is little doubt in my mind of illegal things being done towards making sure GME goes under. GME might indeed become the Amazon of videogames. The name, the market and the people behind are there to do it. GME to me is an 100 billion company in a few years.

1696,GME," [Green Goblin + Johnny English + GME crossover]

Green Goblin is out for DFV’s blood after losing tens of millions in GME shorts, Johnny English is the only person dumb enough to take the job as DFV’s protector. 

Johnny fucks literally every possible thing up, which culminates in the negligent homicide of three innocent people after he presses some button on his briefcase he was explicitly told not to press. 

At this point, Goblin manages to kidnap DFV and fly up to the top of a high-rise for whatever reason. He just kind of stares at DFV for a while. 

In the meantime Johnny English gets it together and manages to prevail by sheer stupid luck - he spills a glass of water on Green Goblin’s hoverboard, which causes a malfunction and makes him fall to his death from the building. 

GME instantly hits $20,000, and then $30,000. Tobin Mackwire pops into frame showing he got a perfect pic of Green Goblin falling to his death. He posts it to WSB with the caption “Hedgefunds When They Underestimate Diamond Knuckles”... Reddit crashes instantly, $GME hits $69,420, everybody is fucking rich and Melvin headquarters are on fire.

All Star by Smashmouth starts playing while the camera zooms out to a sunny city skyline, a thin line of smoke rising in the distance from Melvin burning.

Also retail investors don't have as deep pockets so we could see more of the short squeeze happening on lower borrowing fees. Just curious if there's any site I could use to find this data.

In this scenario, shares were the play unless you were able to get some call options long ago at a low price and strike. Before the sub blew up, there used to always be loss porn posts of people losing all their money (10k-500k losses) on worthless options they thought would pay off.

Edit: a quick look at the option chain on Yahoo finance shows if you bought the 800 call yesterday, you'd be down 85% today. Yes they're cheap (6 bucks a contract) but probably not gonna make anything more than 5% if they don't expire worthless. Or they expire worthless.",tacotalkspodcast,30,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lszyv3/gme_short_fee_up_1500/goue150/,0.136,0.809,0.055,-0.8807
1726,GME," When you buy an option, you pay with cash. The ""premium"" (remember, think about insurance) is the price you pay. You lose that if you're wrong, or if you sell it before it expires completely worthless.

So from the start.

I have $1.00. I think GME is going to $900. I buy 1 CALL with a strike price of $800. The premium is $0.01. Every option contract covers 100 shares, so my price is $1.00. Looky there, I just happen to have $1.00. I exchange my $1.00 for 1 BUY CALL 800 [Expiration Date]. I now have 1 BUY CALL 800 and $0. If my 800c expires worthless because GME only made it to $700, I still have $0. The price I paid was completely lost. And, again, the 800c is only worth money above $800 GME stock price.

When you BUY an option, your maximum risk is the price you paid for the contract. You can't BUY CALL and then lose more money; you already lost the money—you just exchanged it for the contract. Whether you gain it back is up to what your contract is worth as the days roll by and your contract becomes more or less valuable to other people who might want to buy it.

If the price gets to $750 and someone really wants your contract, they might offer $0.10 per share for it. That would be a 900% profit (10x your money in total) for you, even though $800 is still $50 away. This is because options are on their own market, like stocks, and anticipating the future is the entire bet. Still, if you held the 800c to market close and it's still $750, your option dies and you have no money.

1733,AMC," If you are buying an option, regardless of CALL or PUT, you can only lose the price you paid.

Some things you should understand before buying an option:

1. You can sell it to someone else before it expires. This could be for more or less than you paid.
2. The value goes down over time because there is less time for the stock price to move into being profitable on expiration. The closer to expiration, the more dramatic the loss of value. This applies to CALLS and PUTS at all strike prices. Sellers can make money by ""selling time"" like this, if the price does not move and make the contracts they sold profitable to the person they're betting against. Value lost due to time is called Theta decay.
3. During times of large swings in price, IV goes up. IV is ""implied volatility"", or the belief that the price is unstable and will be swinging around a lot. IV increases the price of options, because the people selling them initially (writing them) are at a greater risk of the price moving out of their profit range. And the seller is on the hook for a big loss equal to how hard the buyer wins. When the IV goes down suddenly, it can drop the price of options very quickly. This ""IV Crush"" event is one of the hardest and fastest learning experiences in options trading. If you buy options leading up to a news event, you have already paid a premium for that news. It's priced in according to the bet the writer is making on that option sale.

Just be careful. Buying during high IV is both understandable, and easily dangerous. You may not be assessing your risk appropriately, so when you *do* lose, even if you are ""okay with losing"", you will take some emotional damage in the form of confusion about *why* the price fell so hard on you.

Happy retarding, ape brother.

EDIT: Oh yeah, that's right. Bad idea. I think it's a bad idea. IV is high right now, and March 5 is next Friday. You're almost guaranteed to have no idea how screwed you are until next Friday. Prices are moving too fast to YOLO this early when A) Theta decay and B) you will gain new price insight about March 5 as next week progresses. You're much better off buying AMC and holding it for a year.",checkdateusercreated,31,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lszyv3/gme_short_fee_up_1500/goupm3g/,0.118,0.779,0.103,-0.5711
1734,EDIT," EDIT: No. Assuming you have Level 4 options permissions, you could sell calls for stock you don't own and collect the premium. You would then be turbofucked if the price went over your strike + premium break even level, for as many dollars beyond the mark it goes.

Naked and Covered calls are call sell strategies as opposed to buying, and naked calls have infinite risk of loss unless you limit it with some other instrument.

A 100c write would give you the premium and force you to pay for every dollar for every share above that price in order to deliver that many shares to the call buyer who is calling them away from you in exchange for $100 a piece, when and if that price is exceeded on the market and at the moment that right is exercised.

This is a dangerously bad idea in high volatility environments and the very reason behind multiple known and likely a greater unknown number of suicides. Don't fuck your life up over a bad bet.

EDIT: The obligation to purchase is held by a PUT seller, who can then *be* PUT the shares at a specified price. A naked call is the obligation to DELIVER the shares to the call holder who is calling them away.

Shit.

EDIT 2: Specifically, buying calls for stock you don't own is just called...buying calls. You have the right to call the shares for a specified price, which profits if you can then sell them at a higher price than you paid for the right and the shares combined.

1751,IMO," IMO (not financial advice or a professional):

There are a ton of ITM options expiring today and Robinhood notified anyone holding with today's expiration that they may close them early (think noon instead of an hour before the closing bell). If people exercise their options, then they will have to hand over the shares which would cause the price to rocket. But if people are just selling their contracts instead of exercising (which is what I think is happening), then we will see a dip. 

I believe this was why it made it to \~$500 the last time before they stopped allowing people to buy. There were a ton of ITM calls, but at more affordable prices, so people were exercising so that they could sell their stocks at different prices and make more money than just selling the contract.

I think HFs will be doing whatever it takes today to get the price down because they need to get below their option walls so they don't lose money. Today is the last trading day of the month and firms report to their partners/customers at the end of every month. They need to look good otherwise people take their money elsewhere. This is where I think there could be some manipulation (because of what I said about Robinhood above). There will be options closing out earlier than usual and if you don't have the capital to buy the 100 stocks, then they just sell your contract ""at the best price they can."" 

So we need to exercise. If long ITM calls were also exercised, then this is where I think the ""infinity squeeze""/>$1000 would happen. Because no one is worrying about the call options for next month or the next, etc. I'm also talking about naked calls; this is why I believe the float is so insane. This has unlimited risk and are traders *trying* to take advantage of that IV (i.e., see the dude who is seeing DFV for reference of what can happen). 

tl;dr exercising calls would cause the chain reaction needed to make the actual squeeze happen. It's been said on here for months now, that you must BUY shares. This would force the covering and force shares to be presented until there are no more shares, leading to you getting whatever price you ask for your share(s).",baker5586,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lswkr3/100_is_not_the_end_hodl_and_finish_this_fight/gouokoj/,0.049,0.884,0.067,0.8018
1752,EOD," The call can't get executed until the stock price passes the strike price (800 in the case of those calls specifically). If that happens by EOD, the contracts will be exercised at the end of the day and whoever holds the contracts will be buying 100 shares at 800 dollars a share (since the stock price is higher than this, they'll be getting a deal). What's most important however is that'll mean every single call option will be ITM and they'll all get exercised and millions of shares will be called away. However, we don't know who wrote the contacts and how many of them are properly hedged against and how many of them are naked. 

I think as apes, we need to be realistic about gAmMa SqUeEze and not assume, or spread the idea, that the millions of shares that will exchange hands in such an event is going to be from naked call sellers (see: short sellers) and that that event is going to take us $420690. If, hypothetically, 80% of the calls are covered by the writers, who can be both firms and retail, then only 20% of the calls are naked and will have a much smaller squeeze effect than people expect. Also, people have been using the 800 calls as a means to assume that the price is gonna fly by EOD. I'd like that, but realize we're retarded here. One of us definitely bought those 800 calls thinking full well that it's gonna get there, but the writer wrote those assuming it's not gonna get there. They probably wrote deep OTM calls to protect themselves and still lock in IV-rich premiums.

Because of this, on Friday, your GME options expiring 2/26 may be at a higher chance than usual of being closed out if you are unable or choose not to close them out yourself.
How does this affect me?
If we determine that your option contract is at risk of being in the money at expiration and you don’t maintain the necessary collateral to support assignment/exercise, we may take proactive measures to help reduce your account risk, including closing at-risk positions prior to expiration date. This may also include, but isn’t limited to, spread positions with a theoretical max gain/loss.
Please note that having the collateral to place the trade is different from having the collateral to support exercise/assignment.
What actions might I consider taking?
As always, it’s important to stay on top of your portfolio and monitor the market closely. You may check out these articles for some best practices on monitoring and exiting your positions: simple strategies, advanced strategies.
If you have any questions about your account specifically, please reach out to our support team. We’re here to help.

2083,GME," I like the analysis. I think it is super important to understand the impact call options have on price as they provide the most and cheapest leverage to us retailers.

A couple of caveats that I see that could significantly change the # of shares option market makers need to buy:

1. This Friday I see only 10-15k call options above current price. Assuming most call options with strike below current price are already hedged, this means best case that at most 150,000 shares need to be bought today if price skyrockets (over 800$ or more). The volume for the first minute today was 4.9M. So the 150k shares that could be bought are pretty much irrelevant.
2. People typically sell calls before expiration as they either dont want to take the risk of holding GME over the weekend or dont have the capital/margin to acquire the shares. This means that option market makers do not actually have to buy the shares. They can, for example, accept increased risk, hedge using further out options, borrow shares in advance (deliver the short shares rather than buy and increase price further), maybe even dump shares prior to option expiration to collapse price and make some ITM options worthless. 
3. Calls expiring further out will not reach a delta of 1 even if price > 800. For example, a call at 800$ expiring in a month can still have a delta of 0.75 even if the current price is >1000. So the number of shares that need to be bought is significantly less than 33M even if the price goes astronomic short term.
4. Even if 33M shares eventually need to be bought for hedging, the option market makers have plenty of time to do so. Coming back to volume vs. shares needed for full hedging, 33M shares is currently less than a day's volume. Assuming that these 33M will be bought uniformly over the next 3-6 months (last expiration date is more than a year from now), I simply dont see a clear big buying pressure. 

Please correct my thinking if I'm wrong. It would be nice to have an automatic calculator that predicts daily how much shares need to be bought as a function of the option chain and price. I would not mind putting something like this together once I get a better understanding of the mechanics.",OptimalLawfulness227,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsggit/why_options_will_make_the_squeeze_go_parabolic/gou6xx7/,0.057,0.795,0.148,0.9873

Edit: For those responding (depending on how much i actually make since I bought in quite high) I’d like to make a 501c3 nonprofit charity specifically.

The plan would be to have a majority of its holdings in the market and spending 10-15% of that a year on whatever I charter it to do.

Option calculator: https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html

Basically, the calls give you the right, but not the obligation, to buy shares at the strike price. This is why options automatically expire worthless if the stock isn't more than the strike. He can sell the call option to someone else, and eventually the option can find someone who will have the money to exercise the option.

For example, if GME ends at $805 today, he could sell those options for the difference between the stock price and the strike (minus the initial cost on each).

650contracts x 100shares x $5.00 = 325000

325000 - $11050 (initial cost @ 0.17 per contract) = 313950 (tendies!)

2176,GME," From the beginning? I can try. I'm not a professional or anything, just my take on the situation:

From what I understand, hedge funds ""Shorted"" certain stocks, meaning they ""borrow"" it to sell off (*with the promise of buying/returning it back, later*), betting that the price of those stocks will drop. Then, they **USUALLY** can buy it back for cheap, and give it back to who they borrowed it from, and keep the difference in money. 

They did it to GME (Gamestop), Reddit noticed these hedge funds were ""shorting"" (*again, borrowing*) stocks, and selling more than actually exist in reality (140%?). And because the price is going up (*because ""regulars folks"" are buying it up for the lulz and they like the stock*), that means the the people who ""borrowed"" that stock will eventually ***HAVE TO*** buy it back in order to give back the stock they borrowed. That's referred to as a ""Squeeze"" which is essentially a reverse UNO card on those that were shorting the Stock.

Everything since that happened is just chaos, speculation, laughs, while Wall St. and Hedge Funds are losing their collective minds and money over it. Most news organizations are trying to figure out what the ""strategy"" on this subreddit is, and essentially, there is none, aside from:

* ""We just like the Stock (Gamestop)""
* Sending a message to hedge funds who've made their fortunes aggressively shorting and ruining companies and their employee/workers lives.
* Maybe holding on to the stock during a squeeze might cause a epic-level spike in price to huge payouts for those who bought and held, but I feel most are seeing that as a sweet bonus to all this madness.

2177,APR," It’s just short sellers need to actually borrow the stock they sold - in theory but not really in practice. Like any market, supply and demand control the prices(fee) to borrow. Usually its like 1% APR, so low that the interest you earn on the money from the short sale usually covers any fees.

But don’t listen to these apes, no one is running out of shares to borrow. You got days to settle and weeks before the sec even asks and if you’re short just buy to cover and immediately short sell again. The calendar will reset. It’s a shell game.

 Don't quote me but the interest rate  gets set based on the share price, volatility, and amount of shares available to borrow.   As the price and volatility go up, so does the cost to borrow.   Hypothetically, shorts could simply pay the interest and not have to close regardless of price.   As a last ditch effort they can always short more just to sell and pay the interest if they had to.   There's a ton of things they could do.   The more the price rises though, the more costly their tactics can become.  
 The squeeze can only happen, if retail buys, holds and does not sell.  Not because diamond hands, but because if your buying and selling then you are adding to liquidity and and the stock price will not drastically go up, with high liquidity and middling volume.  

 I think we COULD beat the hedgefunds.  And could force a short squeeze.  But there is simply too many conflicting messages and not enough unification in WSB. 

 How to fix the problem?

 Buy. Hold. Buy. Week. After week. After week. 
 Once we buy up the float, liquidity drops and then the price really begins to move higher.  This is what caused the jump on Wednesday.  Tuesdays volume was only 7 million shares.  Retail had locked down liquidity , probably due to the example DFV set.  
 However, as soon as we started to win.  People sold.  Literally, had no one sold...

  Had not ONE of us sold.   When those shorts covered on Wednesday the price moved 50$ on 90 million volume.
  How far would it have moved on 7 million volume instead?  
  
  I do not think we can ever organize enough people to buy and not sell to make the squeeze happen.

ETF's are a corner store that sell fruit baskets containing orange, apples and bananas.

The hedgefunds are borrowing fruit baskets from the corner stores and paying them a few dollars for every day they keep the fruit basket.

They're then taking the banana out of the fruit basket and selling it to an ape, but they still need to buy a banana back at some stage otherwise the fruit basket is not whole and the store will not take it back, which costs the hedgefund a few more dollars for each day they hold onto it.

And as we all know, it's very difficult to seperate an Ape from it's banana, you'd want to have something that an Ape values over a banana... tendies.",fitfoemma,277,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lt49gl/theres_only_500000_shares_left_to_short_buy_and/govst6a/,0.029,0.932,0.039,0.0799

OK That's good for us because the more shorts the bigger the SQUEEZE. I have 500 at $8.10 I'm looking for a big squeeze today if we all buy. I am long and strong.

2613,GME," Options, specifically a call option in this case.  The original lifeblood of this sub.  A contract (that you can trade) that allows the holder of the contract to buy 100 shares at a given price (the strike).  The catch is that unlike holding shares, there is a time limit (the expiration date).  That time limit is what makes options the game that it is.

So while the GME stock was being sleepy, the costs of contracts were relatively low.  This advanced ape purchased a contract, most likely a weekly (expires at the end of the week) betting the price would go up to or exceed a certain strike price.  Well that happened, and it happened fast which causes several other factors to add to the value of the contract.  He will either sell the contract (the unrealized profit you see on the screenshot) or exercise it at expiration (unlikely) to buy 100 shares at the strike price no matter how much higher the price of GME is.  For most retail traders, options contracts are not a buy and hold to expiry game.

I'm actually surprised people didn't notice options sooner.  The Overlord DFV was playing both shares and options.  Options are why his account suddenly went up to 14M.",darksier,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsshyy/holy_fuckkkk_75_to_78k_why_did_i_not_buy_more_had/gotyf3n/,0.033,0.841,0.125,0.9442

If it closed at $8.50 and people wanted to execute and hold for the weekend, then can see that happening.   It is more likely that someone executed it when the stock was in the $10+ range and sold it.

You'd only execute the $8 call if you thought it would blow up over the weekend (but not confident enough to buy it at $7.80 a couple hours ago)

2717,CAN," If an option is OTM and expires (meaning it never hits its strike) then it's literally worthless and the person/intuition who sold this to you has made pure profit.   


If an option is ITM and expires then the person/intuition who sold it to you have 2 days to go get the actual shares and deliver them to you. If these people/institutions were not selling covered calls then they have to go out on the market and buy them at whatever cost and deliver them to you.   


The intense options activity can create a positive feedback loop by increasing demand for actual shares.   


This is not a gamma squeeze, which are market makers trying to hedge by an increase in price beyond their expectations to get risk neutral. This CAN happen though if the calls sold were not covered, so as they become likely to be ITM the sellers have to rush out to buy the shares before they have huge losses. It's why gamma spikes can be insane.",bosshax,57,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lt421e/gme_bb_nok_amc_option_expiry_today_very_close_to/gov3u9c/,0.065,0.821,0.115,0.802

2818,GME," What people like Kramer and self stylized investors don’t seem to realize when they label events as foolish is that this is a direct counter to unchecked harmful market speculation by the people who hold all the money. They can’t understand the method because it’s not a part of the playbook they know so well. 
Brokers may very well restrict trading on margin for buyers today. But the major institutions are trading naked shorts and money back forth, they have UNLIMITED margin between themselves. The only way another player can hope to partake is by forcing them to focus their capital( in direct opposition to the idea of a well diversified portfolio) and drawing it away by the billions the way retail has. That very action is itself a “market” reaction to dangerous institutional behaviors allowed BECAUSE the governing bodies refused to install regulations after catastrophic financial crises.

2824,RH," I wonder how many people realize that this is almost the same type of situation that happened in 2008. These huge institutions are manufacturing value by exponentially increasing risk exposure through artificial naked shorting between themselves. Just like the packaging of shitty housing bonds. They’re selling these back and forth with the notion that the money is contained to their elite system. But what happens when a large portion of that capital is suddenly expelled into retail and is no longer in the false institutional economy? A hedge fund goes bankrupt from covering shorts. And that causes another domino to fold and another. RH could implode from margin requirements that are unmeetable. Parent companies collapse or need to be bought and bailed out by players who don’t realize they’re in the same boat waiting their turn. 

This was all preventable. You can regulate speculation without crippling it.

2829,RC," Still not enough karma to comment, newly aped autist.  

I was thinking about this last night as well.  We don't know when the squeeze will happen because of all the manipulation of the stock price, but as many DDs have theorized, RC at the helm of a powerhouse E-Commerce company in the gaming industry with this much free PR could make the stock worth well over $100 within the year.  The squeeze will come from the value of the stock appreciating within the console cycle well outside of the shorted prices.  The options will be the nail in the coffin but we also don't know when that will happen as the stock price is attacked when more options become ITM.  We need a stronger catalyst than a retail buying frenzy.  Maybe a dividend announcement?

2831,RC," This is the best part of it. 

>I don’t have an exit strategy until RC succeeds in transforming the business

I've dumped in what I could afford at the time, and I can't justify the risk as it stands at the moment to put more in (Like... 10 shares is a third of my paycheck... Can't do it at the moment).

Even if this shit drops back down to $10, and stays, I genuinely believe this stock will be atleast $150 in 18 months, higher further down the line. With the amount I've put in, I'll be able to continue saving in different ways, sell the stock when I think it makes sense, and put the proceeds towards my house deposit.

It would be a shame to lose the potential $1k per share gain, but at the same time, I'll get where I'm going anyway. The only difference is if it happens this year, or 5 years down the line.",lankyweirdo,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lst66i/the_real_moon_play_multifaceted_infinite_squeeze/gotnk38/,0.051,0.878,0.071,0.2805
2832,AI," The entire point of this idea is that the mechanics are being broken by players refusing to acknowledge parameters. They learned to cheat the system back at us the first time. 
Shorts are creating shorts of shorts. They don’t exist. They’re making unlimited shares to maintain their position. So buyers are gonna do the same thing, but purposely inside an arena that can’t be expanded indefinitely. They can make up the shorts they borrow back and forth. But there are only so many shares. 
Could they force a reverse split or issue new shares against shareholders and the company’s will? Idk. 

I think it’s kind of amazing because this is the defining characteristic of using the the stock market instead of gold. It increases the amount of perceived wealth beyond the physical capabilities of the world. There’s not enough gold or precious metals to equal the world economy. It’s made up to represent something that can’t exist. And now that very same principle may be inadvertently used to either destroy the system or force an evolution of financial theory. 

I’m not saying the AI is right necessarily, but I am saying it’s gonna take a deeper look at what happens when institutions owe more than they can’t deliver, and resulting price movement further exacerbates the original step. 

You know how when you buy a call it technically has the potential for unlimited gain because the stock can theoretically go up infinitely?

2958,ALL," Okay, this is a lengthy write up, and I genuinely didn't want to have to spell this out for you apes who don't understand what's going on yet, because I'm pretty sure SEC is gonna be all over this soon. I will note, I'm not an insider, I'm not a financial adviser, I have no ties whatsoever to any financial firms, this is just pure speculation on what I have seen from the outside, I bought GME because I like the stock.

&#x200B;

This is what I BELIEVE was going to happen tomorrow -

&#x200B;

1. Whales bought a massive amount of call options for this Friday. This is probably from a singular institution or a couple of them. If you have been noticing this week, there was a massive influx of orders for $3 calls expiring this Friday, and also $50 calls expiring this Friday.
2. The short interest is obviously still insanely high, we can argue about 100% or over 70% or whatever, but it's high enough that shorts obviously need to beg to cover their positions.
3. On Wednesday, we had a massive spike, because one of the hedge funds going short knew what was going to happen on Friday when those $50 calls finished in the money, and bailed on their short buddies in true Prisoner's Dilemma fashion. You do NOT want to be the last shorter to get out of your position, because you will end up eating the cost by FAR the hardest.
4. The plan, (AGAIN THIS IS ALL SPECULATION I HAVE NO INSIDER CONNECTIONS) was to exercise all of the ITM calls at the exact same time. Why would you do this as a massive whale instead of just buying shares when they're low and drive the price up? Think in the mind of a wall street shark who wants to KILL an opposing hedge fund. They want that hedge fund to be blasted in to the sky. The ONLY way to do that is not by submitting large scale orders, but by creating a gradual gamma squeeze for new OTM contracts and then exercising all of the ITM contracts at the exact same time, so the shares that need to be delivered literally won't exist. They aren't relying on the noob retail trader to diamond hands all the way up to 10K+ a share, so the jump from 200 or so to 10K has to be violent and immediate. This also gives the shorts NO chance whatsoever to make any kind of money on the way up, but immediately forces them to default on the brokers because there is no way they can cover for the calls that were sold earlier in the week when each of them now goes for 100K+ minimum.
5. Robinhood must have got the tip off that this was the play that was going to happen. NOW, what side they are on is 100% determined by what they deem is ""sufficient collateral requirement"" to exercise the contract. Are we talking about 100% collateral? 200% collateral? 100x collateral? This makes no difference for small traders as no way they were going to exercise the contract to begin with, but that is DIRECT market engineering against the long whales who were almost certainly planning to exercise the  ITM calls, DEPENDING on how large the collateral requirement is. THIS COULD ACTUALLY BE A WAY WAYY LARGER COLLUSION WITH THE SHORTS THAN THE FIRST TIME!!!

2. The short interest is obviously still insanely high, we can argue about 100% or over 70% or whatever, but it's high enough that shorts obviously need to beg to cover their positions.
3. On Wednesday, we had a massive spike, because one of the hedge funds going short knew what was going to happen on Friday when those $50 calls finished in the money, and bailed on their short buddies in true Prisoner's Dilemma fashion. You do NOT want to be the last shorter to get out of your position, because you will end up eating the cost by FAR the hardest.
4. The plan, (AGAIN THIS IS ALL SPECULATION I HAVE NO INSIDER CONNECTIONS) was to exercise all of the ITM calls at the exact same time. Why would you do this as a massive whale instead of just buying shares when they're low and drive the price up? Think in the mind of a wall street shark who wants to KILL an opposing hedge fund. They want that hedge fund to be blasted in to the sky. The ONLY way to do that is not by submitting large scale orders, but by creating a gradual gamma squeeze for new OTM contracts and then exercising all of the ITM contracts at the exact same time, so the shares that need to be delivered literally won't exist. They aren't relying on the noob retail trader to diamond hands all the way up to 10K+ a share, so the jump from 200 or so to 10K has to be violent and immediate. This also gives the shorts NO chance whatsoever to make any kind of money on the way up, but immediately forces them to default on the brokers because there is no way they can cover for the calls that were sold earlier in the week when each of them now goes for 100K+ minimum.
5. Robinhood must have got the tip off that this was the play that was going to happen. NOW, what side they are on is 100% determined by what they deem is ""sufficient collateral requirement"" to exercise the contract. Are we talking about 100% collateral? 200% collateral? 100x collateral? This makes no difference for small traders as no way they were going to exercise the contract to begin with, but that is DIRECT market engineering against the long whales who were almost certainly planning to exercise the  ITM calls, DEPENDING on how large the collateral requirement is.

Also JP Morgan and other dumb banks are buying puts on volatility which is extremely stupid with the coming hike in rates and all this run up in the market.
