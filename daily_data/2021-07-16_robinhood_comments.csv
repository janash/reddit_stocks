1,ADS," The underlying stock may have split, but did the ADR need any change to reflect this? I see that an ADS itself represents 8 common shares each.

2,BABA," https://marketrealist.com/p/has-alibaba-stock-ever-split/ Yes, I bought NYSE: BABA around the end of 2016 via Robinhood. In 2018 the board approved a 8 to 1 stock split I was excited about and apparently it was initiated on July 15 2019. I have no knowledge of BABAF. So my question remains",wHorze,-5,/r/RobinHood/comments/ol8fcc/ive_had_alibaba_stock_for_5_years_they_made_a_8/h5cxufv/,0.047,0.786,0.168,0.6908
3,AAPL," So being very novice to options I’d recommend buying  “Buy’s” only until you understand them a bit more.  I wouldn’t worry about selling unless you are selling a contract you’ve bought.

Speaking from experience your going to take some “L’s” with some “W’s”.

When starting out I recommend to my members to not hold until expiration unless they fully understand how the Greeks play into their position; specifically Delta, Theta, and Gamma….unless they are comfortable at purchasing the entire contract at strike price or let their contract expire worthless (some very inexpensive stocks with high IV could be worth the loss for the potential gain….talking like less than $100 loss for a potential $200-$300 gain).

Now mindset with Options needs to be that most will expire worthless (like 95%)….your job is to take profits when profits present themselves…most of the time we’ll before expiration.

Understand that a 10-20% gain doesn’t seem like a lot, but have 5 15% winners = 75%…a lot better win percentage than waiting for those 5 to pop 100%…and potentially have 4 decline into negative for 1 to pop…better odds over time of success keeping your wins consistent until you learn your winning strategy based of your trading personality.

Perfect example use AAPL $149 Call 16 JUL 21 (a trade I did this week)

I bought on 14 JUL 21 @ 10:59 for $0.76 / contract.  I did a swing trade and on the 15th it popped at open to a high of $1.60….then declined to about $0.40…I had 5 contracts and set a limit order to sell 4/5 contracts at $1.50 based off bullish close on 14th….I left one to ride to see what it would do….

The 15th didn’t go well during regular market due to Powell speaking and you saw a sell off….since I made my money on first 4 I swung the lone Soldier to see what Friday (date of expiration) brought….

Out the gate AAPL did what AAPL does and popped at bell…I was able to sell last one at $0.90.

Now lesson learned in example:

I i’m familiar with AAPL, so I know typically what it will do and not do based off of bullish sentiment or Barris sentiment at opening bell. In my earlier days of trading I would’ve held past the $1.60 top because I would assume that it had more room to run. And then I would’ve seen it just tank down into the $.40 area and would’ve sold for a loss because I figured it wasn’t going to rebound. Or would’ve seen it tanking and would’ve sold out immediately once it started dipping fast. However, because I have a little more experience under my belt and I understand this particular underline stock and Company well I knew that based off of my expiration date that anything above $1.20 was good money for my particular strike price and I take my profits When they present themselves.",TradersWarRoom,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/olkebd/level_two_options_strategy/h5fawh9/,0.045,0.824,0.131,0.9926
