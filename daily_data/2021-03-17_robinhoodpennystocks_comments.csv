0,UK," I'll let the trusted source Wiki, tell the story:

""Soros had been building a huge [short position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance)#Currency) in pounds sterling for months leading up to September 1992. Soros had recognized the unfavorable position of the United Kingdom in the [European Exchange Rate Mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Exchange_Rate_Mechanism). For Soros, the rate at which the United Kingdom was brought into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism was too high, their inflation was also much too high (triple the German rate), and British interest rates were hurting their asset prices.[\[69\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Soros#cite_note-amazon1-71)

By September 16, 1992, the day of [Black Wednesday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Wednesday), Soros's fund had [sold short](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance)) more than $10 billion in [pounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling),[\[62\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Soros#cite_note-georgesoros.com-64) profiting from the UK government's reluctance to either raise its interest rates to levels comparable to those of other [European Exchange Rate Mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Exchange_Rate_Mechanism) countries or [float](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_exchange_rate) its currency.

Finally, the UK withdrew from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, [devaluing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devaluation) the pound. Soros's profit on the bet was estimated at over $1 billion.[\[70\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Soros#cite_note-72) He was dubbed ""the man who [broke the Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_the_bank) of England"".[\[71\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Soros#cite_note-73) The estimated cost of Black Wednesday to the [UK Treasury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Treasury) was £3.4 billion.[\[72\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Soros#cite_note-telly-74) [Stanley Druckenmiller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Druckenmiller), who traded under Soros, originally saw the weakness in the pound and stated: ""\[Soros's\] contribution was pushing him to take a gigantic position.""",thosetwoloons2,-15,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m6uu24/popular_investors_alignment_chart/gr89ctf/,0.035,0.852,0.112,0.9442

Plus all three have paid dividends in the past. Two of the three have been paying dividends throughout the pandemic. How do you like them apples?

If you do some DD let me know in the comments section which company has been paying dividends all 2020 and continues to do so during 2021.

89,GNUS," Don’t join their ranks means don’t buy in Super high, buy in now. The bag holders from last year didn’t become bag holders because they bought a bad company (GNUS is Great) but because they were greedy and bought in the $4-$10 range and never sold before it plummeted down. After that hedge funds and shorters attacked GNUS with all this negative news saying they were going broke and getting sued because they said Kartoon Channel was like a Netflix for kids. Lol... Well none of that was true, and GNUS cleared all their debt, started buying all the talent up from Disney, Warner Bros, Toy Companies, and now look at them... Marvel Deal, new ROBLOX series, Stan Lee super heroes, Shaq cartoon series with the writer from Toy Story writing for it! The fact that no one see’s the Marvel Deal as a reason to put all your money into GNUS let’s me know they don’t actually understand what’s going on. Kartoon channel is direct competition for views/subscribers for Disney+. Why give your competition a deal with your top money making franchise if it’s going to take subscribers/viewers away from your streaming platform? Because Disney has a bigger plan for Kartoon Channel. Either to stream them exclusively on Disney+, or to buy them out.
