14,EDIT," Since they bought at $10 I'm going to assume they bought recently.

Short term capital gains are taxed as regular income. That'll range from <12% (from this alone) to about 40% if they're making a lot‚Äîlike over $200k a year.  State taxes can take another 0-10% or so, varies.

If the stock is held for over a year it gets taxed as capital gains instead. Those range from 0-20% depending on taxable income.

EDIT because enough people are commenting about marginal taxes and such: The question was ""how much do you pay on capital gains in the US"" so I'm just giving basic ranges for the two most common situations.

16,CPA," If that's his only income it's not much. Some math assuming its his only income. (Not a CPA and maybe sharing old info from my consulting days. Do your own research and correct me if I''m wrong, just tying to help)

31569 (sell)
- 10766 (buy in expense)
= 20803 (profit)

20803 - 12500 (general deduction) = 8303 taxable income

In that bracket 12% is the rate so
8303 * .12 = 996.36

If he expects a tax return from another job's withholdings the return pays off the liability.

that Papa Elon's got our backs.

And its a disaster, such a catastrophe

I think my lesson from the GME experience is that if you want to invest in single stocks, it is possible to time the market, but it is risky and you need to be watching all the time. I don't find that particularly enjoyable right now, so I think I'll head back to indexing which has covered my GME fuckups.

A) do my own DD

or

B) stomach the risk of YOLOing on meme stocks

then I should stick to indexing. I'm sorry that you consider index funds ""shitty boomer investments"" but that is where my level of DD+Risk tolerance lies at the moment. Its a bull market and I am making 20% on my boomer shit with 0% effort.

Edit: to everyone telling me I FOMO'ed into GME at the wrong time... Fucking duh. We all eat crayons here and I know it's not financial advice. MY lesson is that I need more time to do research, and if I'm not willing to...

A) do my own DD

or

B) stomach the risk of YOLOing on meme stocks

then I should stick to indexing. I'm sorry that you consider index funds ""shitty boomer investments"" but that is where my level of DD+Risk tolerance lies at the moment. Its a bull market and I am making 20% on my boomer shit with 0% effort.

193,GME," >  there is no new hard information that refutes the original thesis.  

I don't get this, hard data did come out saying the short interest has gone way down.  This was released Monday morning (2/1) and GME was still trading above 300 at that time. I saw the data and got out at 315 because of I WAS FOLLOWING THE ORIGINAL THESIS AS PLANNED.   I have been on WSB for years and bought in at 42, all you guys who came in way late have taken over the narrative on this sub and created an echo chamber  of confirmation bias catering to the guys who missed the signal to get out. People need to pay more attention  and you can't just assume the short data the entire thesis was based on is all the sudden unreliable just because it doesn't fit the narrative that we were somehow going to be able to ""name our price"".  This was never going to happen, if it played out the way you guys dreamed about it, the hedge funds would just go bankrupt and get off the hook that way, no scenario would they really be paying out unlimited funds to everyone.  You lost a battle but not the war, but if you want to win the next battle you need to take some time for real reflection so you can learn from your mistakes.  You can never get ahead of the pack while following them, it won't work.  Anytime an asset is trading way above it's real value you are playing musical chairs, always better to secure a chair sooner rather then latter.  If you learn these lessons from the situation then it could easily be worth it.  You will become a more sophisticated trader going forward and fair much better in future battles.",fivealive5,57,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lei4xu/you_guys_are_coming_back_for_me_rightgme_240/gmhcaqi/,0.079,0.766,0.155,0.9847

If you are not expecting or receiving compensation for your recommendation, then it is completely legal in the USA to give stock tips and other financial advice.  There is no distinction between stock tips and other financial advice like, say, recommending that someone put their money in a savings account.

Even if you are being compensated (e.g., if you have a finance website), as long as you make it clear that you are not recommending investments but merely discussing the merits of investments, it's also legal.

~~**Covering** short positions does not equal **closing** short positions. No one said they closed short positions, only that they covered.~~ They ~~cover~~ hedge using options (short puts or long calls), which can be anywhere from days to years in expiration, meaning they spread the demand over months eliminating the squeeze, leaving only slow upward growth.

From u/caraissohot:
>Wrong. Covering a shorts means buying the stock that you shorted and closing the position. This is very easy to google. There is not a single definition that agrees with you. If you cover a short you are closing it.

What I described is called hedging. What remains is that for GME it doesn't really matter if the shorts are covered or hedged. The possibly-formerly-large-short-sellers are no longer under massive pressure to cover.

286,GME," For those bag holding. There are only two ways to get your money back immediately in the short term. I do not think it is possible, but these are the only options I see.

1. GME institutional investors suddenly announce they have bought majority of the float. 

2. A third party, announces they have bought and locked up the float, as part of a buy out of GME

Both options are the Porsche/VW scenario. $1.5-3 billion of investment is required to do this and I don‚Äôt know of any companies currently interested in GME.

Third option is Cohen and the new team, turn this company around and you get your money back in 3-5 years. Remember gaming is a $150 billion dollar annual industry and GME‚Äôs annual revenue is only $7 billion.
Cohen became a billionaire in his early 30‚Äôs by taking on Amazon, so this dude is the real deal and understands the big picture.
If you can sit tight for 3-5 years, and GME give him control, the shares will return to at least $100-200 range.

289,GME," FYI,  the finra short interest reports would've been released on Jan 12 (4:00pm), which then led to tremendous volumes happening the following day (Jan 13).  Volumes that I don't think retail investors could sustain.

[https://web.archive.org/web/20201229153006/https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest](https://web.archive.org/web/20201229153006/https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest)

This could be interpreted as a large HF going in for the kill by buying up float, or shorters moving to cover their positions.  The tremendous jump in shorts between the 12th and 13th could either be people getting in thinking it'll be going down (with that short interest?!) or doubling down on shorts to suppress the price by flooding the market with ""synthetic"" longs,

This could be interpreted as a large HF going in for the kill by buying up float, or shorters moving to cover their positions.  The tremendous jump in shorts between the 12th and 13th could either be people getting in thinking it'll be going down (with that short interest?!) or doubling down on shorts to suppress the price by flooding the market with ""synthetic"" longs,

Hint: 90%+ of these shorts were opened by Market Makers/HFT Algorithms and closed within seconds or minutes.

296,GME," The entire fallacy of /r/wallstreetbets is thinking that the hedge funds needs to cover their shorts. They don't. *Ever*. 

All they have to do is keep paying their short borrow interest, and they've done that without any problems. If they also shorted GME at $300+ (which they certainly did), they've made tens of million on profit on this ""attack"" by WSB. 

Let me illustrate in simple numbers.

If a fun has $100 million in unhedged shorts at $4 (which no hedge fund would ever do, but let's assume) and the price is currently trading at $64, then they need to pay short borrow interest on the $60 difference.

Since short borrow interest is independently negotiated, we have no idea what it actually is, but a retail investor will typically get a rate of around 20% p.a., while a massive investment fund will probably only pay around 2-3% p.a. Let's assume for the same of argument that the smaller hedge funds pay the same as retail investors, and go with 20% p.a. (which they absolutely aren't).

So $100 million in shorts at $4 has a current market value of $1.6 billion, meaning the amount they're paying short borrow interest on is $1.5 billion.

So we do ($1.5 billion * 20%)/365 = $822k. So their daily interest payment on that is $822k. 

If they hedged in the most brass balls way possible, which would be doubling down on shorts, when the market price was $300 and they hedged with a new $100 million short position at $300, they've made a mark-to-market profit of $80 million on that position alone.

It's a shame that /r/wallstreetbets became so obsessed with ""beating the hedge funds at their own game"", because that never had any chance of happening. You guys did something literally amazing by swinging the market massively through sheer power of numbers, and then blew the entire load by getting too greedy.

Excerpt:

The Initial Transaction Example:

‚Ä¢ Stock XYZ trading $51.00

‚Ä¢ May 50 Puts on XYZ trading $3.00

‚Ä¢ May 50 Calls on XYZ trading $3.00 Trader A: Sells 10,000 shares XYZ @ $51.00

Buys 100 May 50 Calls @ $3.00 Sells 100 May 50 Puts @ $3.00

In this example, the ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù position is trading for $50, which is simply Call Price - Put Price + Strike Price. The actual shares are trading for $51, so that Trader A has effectively sold shares for $1 more than it paid for them, in a simultaneous transaction. Each time the trade is made, Trader A is earning a $100 profit2, assuming that (a) Trader A is not being charged a fee to borrow shares to deliver on the short sale and (b) the clearing firm does not effect a buy-in against the trader to close-out a fail to deliver position. In this case, the trade was made 100 times, so that the profit would be $10,000. The sole reason for the disparity between the actual shares and the ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù position is the fact that the shares of XYZ are hard to borrow.

The Second Transaction to ‚ÄúReset the Clock‚Äù Assuming that XYZ is a hard to borrow security, and that Trader A, or its broker-dealer, is unable (or unwilling) to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A‚Äôs clearing firm. Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker-dealer‚Äôs close-out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often, this is done through the use of a buy-write trade, but may also be done as a married put. The vast majority of options trade with the exercise ratio of 1 option = 100 shares, so that an option premium of $1 equals $100.

It is unlikely that a broker-dealer would either be able to borrow shares or buy in the position without incurring or passing on the costs due to the high borrowing fees and large capital commitment associated with the trading. There may be extremely large borrowing costs associated with hard-to-borrow stock and such borrowing costs can negate the mispricing of the options that gave rise to the potential profit opportunity in the first place. These trades are commonly referred to as ‚Äúreset transactions,‚Äù in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close-out a fail.

The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations. The buy-writes may be (but are not always) prearranged trades between marketmakers or parties claiming to be market makers. The price in these transactions is determined so that the short seller pays a small price to the other market-maker for the trade, resulting in no economic benefit to the short seller for the reset transaction other than to give the appearance of meeting his delivery obligations. Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases. Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm‚Äôs responsibility to close out a failure to deliver.

Trader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer‚Äôs close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position. These circumstances vary.

For example, Trader A may be engaging in buy-writes with a known counterparty, such as another market maker (Trader B) that Trader A pays to take the other side of its reset transactions. In this circumstance, Trader A and Trader B agree on a price at which the buy-write will be transacted. The trade is consummated as a spread, with the stock and option portions executed at the same time. Trader A sells calls to Trader B, and Trader A buys shares from Trader B. The size of the trade is dictated by how many shares Trader A is required to deliver to appear to have closed out the settlement fail arising from his short position and avoid a buy-in or large borrowing fees. Trader A knows or has reason to know that the counterparty to the buy-write will not deliver securities in settlement of the transaction.

Rather, To circumvent Reg SHO, traders may set up a one-day FLEX trade, in conjunction with the purchase of the underlying stock to acquire long stock. When the option expires the following day, the trader effectively sells the underlying stock, reestablishing the short position, but the trader may claim, or be credited by its broker-dealer or clearing firm with, having satisfied the close-out requirement of Reg SHO. Traders will pay a very small premium to another trader to do this trade.

In 2003, the Commission issued interpretive guidance in which it stated that ‚Äúit is important to disabuse traders of any notion‚Äù that a married stock/option trade designed to give the appearance of a long position could be used to circumvent regulatory requirements. The Commission further stated that ‚Äú\[t\]he Commission has previously indicated that where transactions involve no market risk and serve no purpose other than rendering a person an owner of a security in order to accomplish indirectly what was prohibited directly, the activity may violate the federal securities laws.‚Äù",PracticalStranger317,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/gmgpnvl/,0.098,0.842,0.06,-0.9841

335,AN," How There is No Mathematical Way Shorts We're Covered for Jan 13th, 22nd, or 25th with GME's 69.75 Million Outstanding Shares

Please note that the below plots are all done using publicly available data from FINRA ([regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html](https://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html)) regarding short volumes and Yahoo Finance for daily volume and GME daily prices.

I promise you the long read is worth it, but the TLDR version is at the bottom in Figure 9. The majority of the text is needed to inform a general audience of how an estimate of over 70 million shorts a day was reached. Please help out if there are any huge oversights, or wrong calculations, in the comments below, as I'm not responding to nearly any chats these days due to all the bots wanting me to either join an illegal conspiracy to raise the price of silver, or just shady as fuck.

Below is just a plot of the daily stock prices at the open and close of trading during regular hours for GME (source Yahoo Finance).

[Figure 1: No real new information from this plot that everyone doesn't already know.](https://preview.redd.it/hm1mk6i09yf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bbe89497fafa8b1d449cf203c66ad2b62cbe111)

So as EVERYONE KNOWS, shorts can cause the price to rise in a given stock as the share of stock must be purchased, and with supply and demand, we aim for the heavens...

[Figure 2: Shorts and Short Exempts \(note y-axis is in MILLIONS\) as reported by FINRA during regular business hours.](https://preview.redd.it/t8yyps5bayf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e17249ce1c3e2349d7d082a2690d77bfa4a8c3ad)

So let's do a quick sanity check. Looking at Figure 2, we see that on **Jan 13th, over 40 MILLION shorts were executed!** So if we check Figure 1on Jan 13th, we should expect to see that the price increased, which it did.

Let's look at it a different way and plot the Closing Price minus the Opening Price to see just how much GME stock price changed each day.

[Figure 3: Overall change in stock price from open to close of GME.](https://preview.redd.it/8dutm3frcyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=458d804b49dea6f728ea29f3946a506a6ac2113b)

This plot seems to be dominated by the wild changes in price during late January/early February, so let's do a normalization trick by taking the above values and dividing them by their respective opening price that day.

[Figure 4: GME Price change relative to the opening price that day.](https://preview.redd.it/iokqj1i4dyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=533c7228e8ff52bbb6cc23fe7bc0a145f0716efe)

Now in Figure 4 we can see the change in price relative to what it was starting out on that day. Again we see that Jan 13th increased, by over 50% that day.

So let's make it easier for everyone and combine Figure 2 and Figure 5 to see both the total number of shorts executed, and the price change, for the same day.

[Figure 5: GME Price change relative to opening price, and the total number of shorts\(both short and \\""short exempts\\""\) during Regular Business Hours, via FINRA](https://preview.redd.it/udf0do41fyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=af67822fa65e5df33bf2b994c30602f7b8582904)

**NOW WE GOT A PLOT!** Here we see both the change in price AND the number of shorts being executed for a single day.

But what do we actually get from Figure 5? **Jan 13th keeps with our hypothesis that MORE SHORTS MEANS MORE GAINS**, but we don't see that across the board though.....?

Jan 13th, Jan 22nd, Jan 26th, and Feb. 5th all show gains in price, and large number of shorts...

**22 days I tracked, and 11 of those days have over 10million shorts during regular business hours, but only 4 days have gains of 20% or greater, and only 3 of THOSE days have gains over 50%.....?**

# Eye Raise:

* **Why hasn't GME reached the Moon with all the Rocket/Shorts Fuel yet?**

\-""The screaming cries of wallstreetbets""

Hmmmmm, ok, well  maybe we should also compare the overall volume of GME also and not just the shorts. The HYPE was/IS real over GME, and the world took notice. Let's see how the volume changed with it.

First, just plot out the daily volume during regular business hours.

&#x200B;

[Figure 6a: Regular Hours Daily Volume for GME, as reported by FINRA](https://preview.redd.it/8401qqamiyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=308bf45b5b5f75766d96d57ca55bbee0b9c873eb)

Alright, what do we get out of this plot...? Well, from Jan 13th and onward the volume shot THROUGH THE FUCKING ROOF, compared to early January.

**BUT WAIT A DAMN MINUTE?!?!?!?**

I didn't hear about the GME Hype Train until mid to late January!? From what I can find googling it seems that most major news outlets didn't really report on WSB/GME until Jan 21st, with serious mentions coming around Jan 24th weekend.

# General Assumption I'M MAKING:

# Most of the actual ""Retail Investors"" didn't join GME until weekend after Jan 22nd.

&#x200B;

[Figure 6b: Full Daily Volume as reported by Yahoo Finance for GME. Note that Figure 6a is contained within Figure 6b.](https://preview.redd.it/bxnpcbheuyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fe167ab117d9d361f7f2926d85bc837319dcf33)

# So, ASSUMING, the above, let's say the higher volume AFTER Jan 25th is from Urist McLossesMoney.

So what's with the crazy high volume before then? Is it from the insiders, the true chosen among us, the users in r/wallstreetbets that aren't bots?----->NOPE.

Almost certainly volume before Jan 22nd is from the hedge funds having to buy up the shorts they WAY THE FUCK overextended on! The ""big bois"" had to join us bottom feeders and buy up the stock to cover their 9000% short shares... maybe.

Anyway we can check something else that to shine some light into what happens during the dark hours of trading... After Hours Volume.

[Figure 7: Regular Hours Trading compared against After Hours Trading for GME](https://preview.redd.it/dzjkv3zqlyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=30b68bc546184bc5e079101a4c9d9d66b1955365)

**I DO LOVE PLOTS!!!!** Here, I've taken the regular hours volume(again from FINRA) and subtracted it from the day's total volume, as reported by Yahoo Finance, to get the After Hours Volume. But again what stands out/what's the point of this plot?

# After Hours Volume overtakes Regular Hours Volume Jan 22nd, and has remained where MOST of the action is going on!

**GENERALLY**, ""Retail Investors"" don't/CANT engage in after hours trading. And also, don't confuse what you do on your trading app at 2am with what broker-dealers and big bois are doing at 2am.

We see around Jan 13th, after hour volume went above 50million, my general dumbass guess is because HF's needed to buy shares to cover shorts, and the few following days thereafter.

Hmmmm. OK, let's take a step back and look shorts again....

&#x200B;

[Figure 8: Percentage of Regular Hour Short Volume as a Percentage of Total Volume during Regular Hours.](https://preview.redd.it/kolo2hw7ryf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=da005e3f065d05341a1fa196c07c9b3b3523793b)

Figure 8 just shows that over half of all volume, just during regular hours, are shorts. **I don't know if there are numbers out there that show after hours shorts, if so PLEASE COMMENT IT!!!!!!**

# And because I can't get after hours short volume, we have to make a wild guess as to this next step.

# So multiply Figure 8 by Figure 6b and you get.....

[Figure 9: Estimated the full daily short volume by multiplying the regular hours short ratio from Figure 8 by the whole daily volume reported by Yahoo Finance.](https://preview.redd.it/yscv7o1ssyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=86594c24fa071bee2a7b7b2e25f607241c13e9b3)

# NOTE: Figure 9 is an estimate, but it's still a low-ball estimate.

**ASSUMPTION --> Let's assume that after hours volume plays just like regular hours trading.**

I STILL HIGHLY FUCKING DOUBT THAT AND WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF AfterHoursVolume was higher than 75% of just shorts.

Still, let's roll with Figure 9. **Looking at Jan 13th, we estimate the number of shorts executed was...over 76 MILLION!**

**And there are.... 69.75M shares outstanding... yep... ok... checks out!**

&#x200B;

**TLDR: Go to Figure 9, NOTE THAT IT'S AN ESTIMATE(and a low one at that), and see how it's impossible that they covered their shorts (ON THOSE DAYS) see edit below.**

Now in Figure 4 we can see the change in price relative to what it was starting out on that day. Again we see that Jan 13th increased, by over 50% that day.

So let's make it easier for everyone and combine Figure 2 and Figure 5 to see both the total number of shorts executed, and the price change, for the same day.

[Figure 5: GME Price change relative to opening price, and the total number of shorts\(both short and \\""short exempts\\""\) during Regular Business Hours, via FINRA](https://preview.redd.it/udf0do41fyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=af67822fa65e5df33bf2b994c30602f7b8582904)

**NOW WE GOT A PLOT!** Here we see both the change in price AND the number of shorts being executed for a single day.

But what do we actually get from Figure 5? **Jan 13th keeps with our hypothesis that MORE SHORTS MEANS MORE GAINS**, but we don't see that across the board though.....?

Jan 13th, Jan 22nd, Jan 26th, and Feb. 5th all show gains in price, and large number of shorts...

**22 days I tracked, and 11 of those days have over 10million shorts during regular business hours, but only 4 days have gains of 20% or greater, and only 3 of THOSE days have gains over 50%.....?**

# Eye Raise:

* **Why hasn't GME reached the Moon with all the Rocket/Shorts Fuel yet?**

\-""The screaming cries of wallstreetbets""

Hmmmmm, ok, well  maybe we should also compare the overall volume of GME also and not just the shorts. The HYPE was/IS real over GME, and the world took notice. Let's see how the volume changed with it.

First, just plot out the daily volume during regular business hours.

&#x200B;

[Figure 6a: Regular Hours Daily Volume for GME, as reported by FINRA](https://preview.redd.it/8401qqamiyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=308bf45b5b5f75766d96d57ca55bbee0b9c873eb)

Alright, what do we get out of this plot...? Well, from Jan 13th and onward the volume shot THROUGH THE FUCKING ROOF, compared to early January.

**BUT WAIT A DAMN MINUTE?!?!?!?**

I didn't hear about the GME Hype Train until mid to late January!? From what I can find googling it seems that most major news outlets didn't really report on WSB/GME until Jan 21st, with serious mentions coming around Jan 24th weekend.

# General Assumption I'M MAKING:

# Most of the actual ""Retail Investors"" didn't join GME until weekend after Jan 22nd.

&#x200B;

[Figure 6b: Full Daily Volume as reported by Yahoo Finance for GME. Note that Figure 6a is contained within Figure 6b.](https://preview.redd.it/bxnpcbheuyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fe167ab117d9d361f7f2926d85bc837319dcf33)

# So, ASSUMING, the above, let's say the higher volume AFTER Jan 25th is from Urist McLossesMoney.

So what's with the crazy high volume before then? Is it from the insiders, the true chosen among us, the users in r/wallstreetbets that aren't bots?----->NOPE.

Almost certainly volume before Jan 22nd is from the hedge funds having to buy up the shorts they WAY THE FUCK overextended on! The ""big bois"" had to join us bottom feeders and buy up the stock to cover their 9000% short shares... maybe.

Anyway we can check something else that to shine some light into what happens during the dark hours of trading... After Hours Volume.

[Figure 7: Regular Hours Trading compared against After Hours Trading for GME](https://preview.redd.it/dzjkv3zqlyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=30b68bc546184bc5e079101a4c9d9d66b1955365)

**I DO LOVE PLOTS!!!!** Here, I've taken the regular hours volume(again from FINRA) and subtracted it from the day's total volume, as reported by Yahoo Finance, to get the After Hours Volume. But again what stands out/what's the point of this plot?

# After Hours Volume overtakes Regular Hours Volume Jan 22nd, and has remained where MOST of the action is going on!

**GENERALLY**, ""Retail Investors"" don't/CANT engage in after hours trading. And also, don't confuse what you do on your trading app at 2am with what broker-dealers and big bois are doing at 2am.

We see around Jan 13th, after hour volume went above 50million, my general dumbass guess is because HF's needed to buy shares to cover shorts, and the few following days thereafter.

Hmmmm. OK, let's take a step back and look shorts again....

&#x200B;

[Figure 8: Percentage of Regular Hour Short Volume as a Percentage of Total Volume during Regular Hours.](https://preview.redd.it/kolo2hw7ryf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=da005e3f065d05341a1fa196c07c9b3b3523793b)

Figure 8 just shows that over half of all volume, just during regular hours, are shorts. **I don't know if there are numbers out there that show after hours shorts, if so PLEASE COMMENT IT!!!!!!**

# And because I can't get after hours short volume, we have to make a wild guess as to this next step.

# So multiply Figure 8 by Figure 6b and you get.....

[Figure 9: Estimated the full daily short volume by multiplying the regular hours short ratio from Figure 8 by the whole daily volume reported by Yahoo Finance.](https://preview.redd.it/yscv7o1ssyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=86594c24fa071bee2a7b7b2e25f607241c13e9b3)

# NOTE: Figure 9 is an estimate, but it's still a low-ball estimate.

**ASSUMPTION --> Let's assume that after hours volume plays just like regular hours trading.**

I STILL HIGHLY FUCKING DOUBT THAT AND WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF AfterHoursVolume was higher than 75% of just shorts.

Still, let's roll with Figure 9. **Looking at Jan 13th, we estimate the number of shorts executed was...over 76 MILLION!**

**And there are.... 69.75M shares outstanding... yep... ok... checks out!**

&#x200B;

**TLDR: Go to Figure 9, NOTE THAT IT'S AN ESTIMATE(and a low one at that), and see how it's impossible that they covered their shorts (ON THOSE DAYS) see edit below.**

337,GME," How There is No Mathematical Way Shorts We're Covered for Jan 13th, 22nd, or 25th with GME's 69.75 Million Outstanding Shares

Please note that the below plots are all done using publicly available data from FINRA ([regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html](https://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html)) regarding short volumes and Yahoo Finance for daily volume and GME daily prices.

I promise you the long read is worth it, but the TLDR version is at the bottom in Figure 9. The majority of the text is needed to inform a general audience of how an estimate of over 70 million shorts a day was reached. Please help out if there are any huge oversights, or wrong calculations, in the comments below, as I'm not responding to nearly any chats these days due to all the bots wanting me to either join an illegal conspiracy to raise the price of silver, or just shady as fuck.

Below is just a plot of the daily stock prices at the open and close of trading during regular hours for GME (source Yahoo Finance).

[Figure 1: No real new information from this plot that everyone doesn't already know.](https://preview.redd.it/hm1mk6i09yf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bbe89497fafa8b1d449cf203c66ad2b62cbe111)

So as EVERYONE KNOWS, shorts can cause the price to rise in a given stock as the share of stock must be purchased, and with supply and demand, we aim for the heavens...

[Figure 2: Shorts and Short Exempts \(note y-axis is in MILLIONS\) as reported by FINRA during regular business hours.](https://preview.redd.it/t8yyps5bayf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e17249ce1c3e2349d7d082a2690d77bfa4a8c3ad)

So let's do a quick sanity check. Looking at Figure 2, we see that on **Jan 13th, over 40 MILLION shorts were executed!** So if we check Figure 1on Jan 13th, we should expect to see that the price increased, which it did.

Let's look at it a different way and plot the Closing Price minus the Opening Price to see just how much GME stock price changed each day.

[Figure 3: Overall change in stock price from open to close of GME.](https://preview.redd.it/8dutm3frcyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=458d804b49dea6f728ea29f3946a506a6ac2113b)

This plot seems to be dominated by the wild changes in price during late January/early February, so let's do a normalization trick by taking the above values and dividing them by their respective opening price that day.

[Figure 4: GME Price change relative to the opening price that day.](https://preview.redd.it/iokqj1i4dyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=533c7228e8ff52bbb6cc23fe7bc0a145f0716efe)

Now in Figure 4 we can see the change in price relative to what it was starting out on that day. Again we see that Jan 13th increased, by over 50% that day.

So let's make it easier for everyone and combine Figure 2 and Figure 5 to see both the total number of shorts executed, and the price change, for the same day.

[Figure 5: GME Price change relative to opening price, and the total number of shorts\(both short and \\""short exempts\\""\) during Regular Business Hours, via FINRA](https://preview.redd.it/udf0do41fyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=af67822fa65e5df33bf2b994c30602f7b8582904)

**NOW WE GOT A PLOT!** Here we see both the change in price AND the number of shorts being executed for a single day.

But what do we actually get from Figure 5? **Jan 13th keeps with our hypothesis that MORE SHORTS MEANS MORE GAINS**, but we don't see that across the board though.....?

They were only hedged if firms did something to negate the loss. So, if your theory is that they opened a new long position in GME (GME price going up is good for this position since now they either own stock or have options that reflect that) so that they could could keep the shorts going then you can say they hedged with this new position.

343,GME," Just my personal retarded opinions:

To me it seemed as follows:

- Pre GME $20 price were the r/wsb GME Gang true believers

- The jump from $20 > $40 were largely shorts getting out early, covering lost positions. 

- from $40 > $150 was the rest of r/wsb taking notice and driving up the price + attention start to generate outside of r/wsb

- $150 > $300 was the squeeze starting üöÄüöÄüöÄ

- At this point News/Twitter/Random Communists/Apes started to take notice and pile on. Soon after market shenanigans ensued with ladder attacks / market insurance companies requiring broker's to cover 100% of cost of trades -> causing Robinhood, not having the capital to cover these trades, to restrict buying -> causing stop of momentum and vast uncertainty during extreme volatility for GME.

- Now the actions and needs of the Hedge Fundies is very opaque... yes there probably is still a lot of short positions in the red. Will they still need to sell and drive up the price? Maybe. Did they find some way to offset their position and now able to unload in a controlled manner? Maybe. 

Was the squeeze stopped before completion? Yes. Will it continue and still happen? Who knows?

If AMC goes under, I can take out a loan buy the local location all intact with projectors, seats, screens ect and start a movie Theater for a couple of million or less. Its hard to start a commercial airline like American Airlines, or mass produce cars like Ford. To replace an operation of that size would take 100's of billions and would be likely to fail. Movie theaters can be small or big and still service the coumminity.  If ford went under Tesla couldn't even fill It's spot. Tesla produces 1 million cars and Ford produced 17.5 million. Tesla would have to double sales every year for 17 years straight to replace Ford. Same for an airline. There are piolts that operate small fleets and contract with major airlines. Then you have Jet Blue which is like the Tesla of the airline industry. They only operate on the east coast and islands with a fleet of 193 planes. to replace American Airlines who has 885 planes and operates in 55 countries would require expansion beyond feasibility.

I think the retail investors have a fond spot for GME and that has helped people hold for belief in the company as opposed to the belief of the HF's that the company is doomed.

480,GME," Here's my theory, and I'm probably wrong, what with being a retard and what not. I dont think the squeeze happened yet, like a lot of you. I think the day Elon first tweeted gamestonk, sent GME skyrocketing because so many people were buying right? The day it hit $480 was not the short squeeze. That was insane market volume buying. I think very few shorts have covered at this point and I dont think they will cover until they get it down to below $20. My theory here is, these brokers dont give a fuck. They're not gonna recall these shorts. You think the brokers that make billions off these hedgefunds are really gonna make them buy back right now? No fucking way. The brokers will bend over for these hedge funds and wait as long as their told. I dont know when or if they'll be a real short squeeze but it won't happen unless people hold and or, keep buying.

Someone please correct me if I'm wrong. I keep seeing posts about the data but haven't heard anyone flat out say, the brokers are working with the hedgefunds NOT to let a short squeeze actually happen. We saw short ladder attacks all week to try and get that price down so they could cover but most of us didn't sell so they didn't cover.

500,CEO," He also single handedly caused an infinity squeeze on a highly shorted and dead company in 2015. What a legend. The [full article](https://moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/) is not behind a paywall or anything, it's a good read. 

Here's some parts of the article.

> Shares of KBIO had bottomed at 44 cent on November 16th, 2015, but then quickly spiked back to over $2.00 on November 18th.   Most observers attributed the rise to some simple (but unexplained) short squeeze.  As ‚Äúan obvious zero‚Äù, KBIO attracted many small retail short sellers, looking to ‚Äúplay the fade‚Äù.  In fact, there was a very good reason why the stock had been spiking up from 44 cents.
> 
> After the close of markets on November 18th (just one day after KBIO received its delisting notice), KBIO announced that an investor group led by Martin Shkreli had just acquired ‚Äúmore then 50%‚Äù of KBIO‚Äôs shares.  So this is why the share price had spiked from 44 cents.   When the market opened the next day, KBIO skyrocketed from $2.00 to over $14.00 on staggering volume, as terrified shorts scrambled for the exits.
>
> After the close on November 19th, KBIO released a second announcement, stating that the group had now acquired a full 70% of outstanding shares and that Shkreli had been appointed as KBIO‚Äôs new CEO and Chairman.  Shkreli‚Äôs group had stated that it would inject an initial $3 million in cash with an additional $10 million following shareholder approval.  By November 23rd, KBIO had briefly hit $45 per share.  But, even then Shkreli was not yet finished with his plan.
> 
>  After briefly hitting $45, KBIO quickly retreated into the $20s.  After all, it was still just a defunct biotech stock without a real drug. Even with a bit of cash from Shkreli, the stock was worth nowhere near a market cap of over $200 million.  Short sellers piled in to short more in the $20‚Äôs on the basis that ‚Äúthis was just a squeeze‚Äù that would quickly fall apart.
>
> As KBIO‚Äôs share price had been spiking, short interest had been growing.  And Shkreli now owned 70% of the outstanding shares.   Then on Thanksgiving Day 2015, when markets were closed, Shkreli tweeted that he had decided to recall his KBIO shares that had been lent out to short sellers.  The resulting squeeze was just a simple math problem.  When Shkreli recalled his shares, brokers would be forced to buy-in the short sellers, causing it to spike uncontrollably.
> 
> When the market reopened on Black Friday for a shortened session, shares of KBIO continued to squeeze higher reminding some investors of the Volkswagen/Porsche infinity squeeze from 2008.  Shares surged 31% as shorts trampled over one another to close their positions.

I got in with $350k when I saw the GME [venture capital valuation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/) post from last month.

556,GME," Lol unity my ass. I've said this from the beginning that anyone who remotely knows what they're doing has been in the GME game for a longer than the people who jumped in the hype at 200+. 

Bought in at 40 or 50, got a bunch of new dumbasses to buy at higher prices, getting it wildly popular all over the internet and slowly selling it at each major price point. Again, keep in mind a lot of the whales bought it when the price was the lower end of 2 digits so their RoI when the stock hit 200 is pretty massive, couple that with a larger sum of stock since the initial buy-in was significantly cheaper. 

Also options trading is what many use too. That's the bet part of WSB, which the influx of new people don't really know. Options is how you make the real money. But you also need money to make money if you're doing options, of course. 

Anyways, point being, everyone is here to turn a profit. Y'all must be super duper deluded to think that everyone will actually hold. Imagine buying GME when it was <20, and you decided to yolo 5K into that bitch. Come last Wednesday-Thurs when you see that shit sitting at 300-480, what absolute fucking numbnut *wouldn't sell at least half to make a retarded amount of money* that took absolutely no effort at all? This is a no brainer guys. Buy the dip, sell high. Look at the massive crash that happened. 49 bucks, perfect time for those that cashed in to toss a decent chunk back in because the price *will* rise, likely not to 480, but enough to make another wonderful bonus.",MisterKrayzie,88,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lecx7j/if_gme_gain_porn_is_cool_again_then_ill_share/gme63tl/,0.054,0.866,0.08,0.8676

574,SI," What is not discussed enough is what strike of options we think they used, which is where I think there is 4 broad scenarios. 

They sell Out of The Money calls, eg strike $800(OTM):
This would have very low delta, hence the hedge funds would need to sell like 5 times their short to get enough length. And if the squeeze ever got to $800 then they would be 5 times more squeezed past that point.

They sell In The Money calls, eg strike $4(ITM):
This would have effectively 100% delta letting them hedge fully quickly, but in reality wouldn‚Äôt change any dynamics, the call would almost entirely act as an already exercised short, making them short again unless price actually falls below $4.

They sell At the Money calls, strike = that days price(ATM):
This would have about just over 50% delta so they would need to sell double their position to fully hedge. And if they did this man did they win so far. BUT they would have then doubled down on their position, the next time a squeeze happens it would happen twice as hard.

They bought Puts at any strike:
This would have the same effect with MM hedging and Hedge Funds rebuying the length. But without too much detail, this would mean the Hedge Funds are paying More premium, increasing their daily costs and meaning the squeeze or fall better happen soon.

TLDR: If I understand correctly, Options to reduce SI is a way to hide but actually would make a future squeeze more prominent.",Arutha_Silverthorn,12,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/gmhqfuk/,0.047,0.883,0.07,0.9041
575,GME," **What shares did Melvin short with?  Who did he think would back his shares when he shorted?  He didn‚Äôt have any, and Citadel barely had any**

This is probably dumb but I'm looking through GameStop's info and various 13-F filings to see who owns how many shares and all that. I'm at the point where I'm not totally sure I know the implication of what I'm seeing, so I'm just wondering if anyone has any input that can help me at least know which direction I should go?

-	Basically, I'm looking at GME's 13-F and trying to see what Melvin Capital LLC and Citadel have/had invested in GME. I know these are not up to date and are just the Q4 numbers.

-	At the end of Q4 2020, Melvin Capital had 5,400,000 shares worth of put options on GME. That was their total investment in GME at the time.

-	GameStops holders for Q4 2020 list Citadel Advisors LLC as the only Citadel company in there. Citadel Advisors LLC has the same data in their 13-F, so there is consistency there at least. Anyways, Citadel Advisors LLC had the following investments in GME stock: 111,805 shares; 2,570,100 put option shares; 2,016,500 call option shares.

-	How was Melvin able to short so much if neither them nor Citadel had the actual shares anywhere to back it up? Between the two of them there are only 111,805 actual shares but then 7,970,100 put option shares (and 2,016,500 call option shares).

-	Even Point72 Hong Kong only had 26,878 shares.

579,GME," I think the shorts are being replaced by new shorts.  It‚Äôs going to be tough to for all shorts to close their position.  The float is just too small.  There‚Äôs only about 42 million shares outstanding after removing the three largest holders that own more than 10% of shares outstanding.  With 5 million subscribers, retail holders could own the entire float with less than 10 shares each.

I also think there‚Äôs three distinct ways retail investors are placing their bets.  Each attracts a different risk tolerance.

Team 1: The diamond hands buy shares not calls.  The original investment thesis was not to put a deadline on when the share price will increase.  Just keep holding and occasionally buying more.  This reduces the float and gives a natural slow increase in price.

Team B - The call buyers.  Lotto ticket buyers had a big impact on the share price increase.  Before becoming a worldwide phenomenon, GME had back to back gamma squeezes made possible by the OTM calls being held to expiration while there was a thin float.

Team C Theta gang showed up.  Attracted by absurd IV, selling deep out of the money puts.  This will put a bottom on share price.  I‚Äôm willing to sell 3/5 $20p because I think fundamentals justify a minimum of $20 based on RC‚Äôs team.  Mark Cuban said last week, ‚ÄúThe lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again.‚Äù  At $300 taking 100 shares out of the float cost $30K.  If I‚Äôm assigned on the shares from short puts, I‚Äôll be assigned 3,300 shares.  If the price keeps dropping towards $20, I‚Äôll increase my position to represent 7,000 shares.  That makes retail shareholders more powerful as the price drops.

The downside for Team A Diamond Hands is limited by the fundamentals near $20, while the upside is several multiples of the current price.  That seems to be a good Wall Street bet.

585,GME," No matter how elaborate you make the conspiracy theory, there's no escaping the fact that bubbles are straight up going to expand as long as new money in larger than old money out, and go down once old money out is faster than new money in. We are way past that point, you already made national news, and then GME was then out of national news, and then drastic selling happened.

There never was a MOASS, and never was one possible. You just managed to get 15-20 or so billion dollars of money to flow into the stock, half of which was probably retail, and much of which was boosted by call option delta, and then gamma hedging (and previously, Melvin's ITM puts which expired, and contributed a ton of short gamma, 5m shares), and then later boosted by Melvin and a few other firms doing absolutely no risk management and being forced to cover underwater... and it just made the stock move in an expected leveraged way at that strength of inflow. Predictably, a bunch of new shorts piled on once it looked like it was all weakening, and will stay short until the flows stabilize, which they haven't. Short GME is one of the best institutional trades in the business right now on this basis. The robinhood unlock was the last hoorah.

You aren't going to be able to do this again to GME, so there's no squeeze to be had. These new shorts are operating from a much higher basis, and longs lack tools.

In particular, IV is at 900%, very few people will buy OTM calls, and if they do, they'll be drastically out of the money, and thus, options won't make a new gamma ramp for you, so it's just new money in, and options were an enormous part of how this happened in the first place. Recall that it was an epic gamma squeeze and minor short squeeze to even get to 70 in the first place, the conditions would take months to be possible again. There's some residual gamma, but it keeps falling off, and huge expirations in April.

I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.

Thank you for your time,

Power to the players,

Tell them you have reason to believe that an emergency shareholder vote has to be called, in order to save the company from bankruptcy. Calling the vote means calling shares back to their owners, eliminating all synthetic stock, and hence taking leverage away from fraudulent shortsellers.

597,GME," So if they're short shares and synthetically long with options, GME to zero means they take assignment of the puts (buy at very low price, closing out their shorts) and if it goes to infinity (assuming the number of call options bought equals shares shorted / 100) then they profit as much as they lose.

Sounds like they are hedged even if they're not closed, correct? If the price spikes does that mean they'll be forced to close still potentially? If this happens they would have to close their shorts first and then sell off the calls at the insane price to cover the losses. However with that kind of volatility they will have trouble I suspect closing all those positions out for a good price as the bid-ask will be insanely large. Worst case for them is they are forced to buy back via a margin call and then the stock tanks and their calls are worthless meanwhile the puts take assignment eventually. This is for real playing chicken with billions of dollars and sounds to me insanely risky from their perspective.",mgwidmann,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/gmi50jx/,0.147,0.776,0.076,-0.9408

601,GME," They've covered, that's why it leveled out at pre-reddit-push price, plus a tiny bit 

Seems like that tiny bit was the new next level apes with diamond hands who know their will be a small swing back but it's goings to take time.

Unless you are buying the dips now, and have been the whole drop, you are going to get hammered...

It's called exit strategy, everyone needs one. People say the shorts don't have the strategy, but unless you are buying and holding you aren't going to be able to tell them I told you so.

Likewise if the shorts really can't cover then they will turn around and take big loans with made up funds, and then use it to borrow against their debt some more. Then they slowly wait for the ""diamond hands"" to drop off and watch their losses turn into long term yields. 

If you think you will make money on gamestop based on the fact that they are worth more than the price suggests, buy, right? Why would you think GameStop was in trouble? They just one of the most epic free PR gimics in history go off, which did nothing but bring them to the forefront of the media. Meanwhile, we are in a supply shortage that gamestop has a ton of pre-orders for and people who are eagerly awaiting getting product at a reliable price. 

Guess what's about to open back up, trade with a major foreign supplier who is just waiting to put their workforce back to the task of building those pre-orders and gadgets that every kid in America is wanting so bad they are learning to code just to try and automate hitting the buy button at...

Yep, Gamestop. GME.

He put his opinion on YouTube, but did not shill or attempt to encourage others.  He can sit there and say ""I liked the stonk, I posted screenshots of my gains on WSB.  My analysis on YouTube is in the open.""  He has no case to answer for his behavior on either YouTube or WSB.

I have no idea whether he's in a corner in his professional capacity, and that is between him and his former employer, but he is a smart, courteous, humble and thoughtful gentleman who will come across well under cross examination.  It would be a brave move to associate himself with WSB conspiracies, or defend or explain the actions of the meme crowd.

A lot of wrong information is still going around, but considering the time-span and the amount of people, this is absolutely incredible.

Then there will be non MM players who would also be selling OTM calls (naked calls or even covered calls) and MMs could offload similar number of shares to remain delta neutral.

So as I understand it, it seems we would want to define some kind of float/options activity ratio as an indicator (no idea what to use to define this, I don't have a finance background). When that ratio gets smaller, the effect you describe becomes stronger and you see the non-linear effect of options activity have a more dominant effect.

Is it possible the initial run up in GME was caused by this effect? If so, this would mean we were in a low liquidity environment on the way up and there may not have been enough shares available for shorts to cover all positions. That would also mean that, contrary to what others are saying, retail actually could have had a large effect on the price action.

This is supported by the fact that when buy side retail was cut off to artificially neuter liquidity two Thursdays ago, we saw the sharp reversal you described.

Fair point. However in simplification the message is coming that for every call bought MMs are going to buy close to 100  shares. Which is not even close. You have to account for net calls bought and sold  plus you have to account for delta. Net Impact is way way smaller than what is conveyed here.

No it isnt. I am referring to following lines from your post.

>Want proof? Go look at 10 day spy chart, right now. Then go look at a GME chart. Look what happens to spy, tick for tick, as GME rises and falls. 

Here is my issue/concern with your post: you claim to teach newbies delta hedging but fail to understand that goal is to be delta neutral, not buy 100 shares (close to) per contract. 

You also kind of hinting that buying 10 OTM calls vs 10 shares is a good idea. Since they are forcing MMs to cover 1000 stocks.. also ignoring the activities on call selling side.

I'm certainly not implying that buying calls is better.  Personally I'm sticking to SPACs near nav for now while I watch this play out. (And some spy scalping to keep my degeneracy credentials)

810,GME," I have no interest in changing anyone's mind, I also own GME.

But most people here don't even know the fundamentals. There was a strange idea circulating that shorts have to cover - not true, they pay interest on their position instead, at the moment that's 0.06% a day (the formula is interest rate/360).

Now if you think they're going to close a position on a stock they're pulling down 10-30% a day to save 0.06% you've got another thing coming. People were saying they'd close last week, of course they didn't, they just murdered the stock instead using basic manipulation techniques. They also shorted it heavily at the peak and took most of our money.

Anyway, I strongly believe this will continue and they'll cover when the stock inevitably goes into the teens or even under 10 bucks, at which point they'll have more than made the difference from their new short positions which are eating our money.

814,IMO," I think most of the true diamond handed apes have enough other money to play with to let this ride. That's the mechanism by which one becomes truly diamond handed--if you needed that money for other trading, groceries etc, you would give too many shits to move on and you'd paperhand out.

Plays like this are a little like playing roguelike games. You start at zero every time, and if you die, you die. There's no leaving the game early to carry your resources to the next game. You give it your all, learn to take risks and accept the consequences, and most importantly, you learn not to invest too much in a single game because winning is no guarantee.

GME: Hedge fund insider reporting

Edit: this is not financial advice

As you can see, most of things going on with GME right now are just MSM being paid to lure normies into selling their positions. For background, I work in one of the major finance companies, not on finance but with machine learning/time series prediction, but I've lots of meetings with lots of people, and people talk. I can't give away too much info because it may cost my job, but the deep shit going on is over the charts, in 100 years this event will be spoken of.

First of all, not all hedge funds shorted GME, this is important because of what is about to happen, some funds managers are actually selling the assholes of their wives and first born sons to banks to get loans, I'm speaking of exorbitant amounts, remember that 35% of the dollars ever printed were printed last year, guess who is going to get a big piece of that ?

GME: Hedge fund insider reporting

Edit: this is not financial advice

As you can see, most of things going on with GME right now are just MSM being paid to lure normies into selling their positions. For background, I work in one of the major finance companies, not on finance but with machine learning/time series prediction, but I've lots of meetings with lots of people, and people talk. I can't give away too much info because it may cost my job, but the deep shit going on is over the charts, in 100 years this event will be spoken of.

First of all, not all hedge funds shorted GME, this is important because of what is about to happen, some funds managers are actually selling the assholes of their wives and first born sons to banks to get loans, I'm speaking of exorbitant amounts, remember that 35% of the dollars ever printed were printed last year, guess who is going to get a big piece of that ?

990,GME," I also think there are three teams on the retail side.  You can‚Äôt completely discount retail holdings.  There‚Äôs only about 42 million shares outstanding after removing the three largest holders that own more than 10% of shares outstanding.  With 5 million subscribers, retail holders could own the entire float with less than 10 shares each.

Team 1: The diamond hands buy shares not calls.  The original investment thesis was not to put a deadline on when the share price will increase.  Just keep holding and occasionally buying more.  This reduces the float and gives a natural slow increase in price.

Team B - The call buyers.  Lotto ticket buyers had a big impact on the share price increase.  Before becoming a worldwide phenomenon, GME had back to back gamma squeezes made possible by the OTM calls being held to expiration while there was a thin float.

Team C Theta gang showed up.  Attracted by absurd IV, selling deep out of the money puts.  This will put a bottom on share price.  I‚Äôm willing to sell 3/5 $20p because I think fundamentals justify a minimum of $20 based on RC‚Äôs team.  Mark Cuban said last week, ‚ÄúThe lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again.‚Äù  At $300 taking 100 shares out of the float cost $30K.  If I‚Äôm assigned on the shares from short puts, I‚Äôll be assigned 3,300 shares.  If the price keeps dropping towards $20, I‚Äôll increase my position to represent 7,000 shares.  That makes retail shareholders more powerful as the price drops.  

The downside for Team A Diamond Hands is limited by the fundamentals near $20, while the upside is several multiples of the current price.  That seems to be a good Wall Street bet.

My two cents for what its worth: You should always spend time learning about the company and have a thesis/DD why you think a stock will move.  Dont let others tell you what to do with your money unless you are convinced yourself.  
Its your money on the line so i say invest the time and energy so you own up to a buy/sell decision yourself - this allows you to build a strong conviction and not get easily swayed by small declines along the way.",Traditional_War_8229,68,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lefi7z/have_conviction_and_hold_through_with_grit_wsb/gmd6t24/,0.019,0.828,0.154,0.9165

1127,FB," When people on FB that i met 15 years ago in High school, that I know are barely into finance, are talking about GME and ""fuck the hedges, never sell"" I knew it was time to sell at $300. I was a teen during the Dot Com boom/bust and one thing I know clearly is that all, and I do mean all, the investment media people had stories about cabbies, hair dressors, airport porters, bartenders, etc giving them stock tips in the run up to the crash. GME went from WSB play getting a little news coverage to a global phenomenon in a week. 

I didn't see how it was gonna get screwed up, but cheaters never stop cheating. Tthe prospect of a 100 billion dollar loss on GameStop was going to bring out the worst of Wall Street. Also, I paid attention to the news story about the Korean fund that bought GME low and then dumped it for a billion dollars in profit. When big money takes a pay day, its better to go with the flow than fight the tide.

I was a teen during the Dot Com boom/bust and one thing I know clearly is that all, and I do mean all, the investment media people had stories about cabbies, hair dressors, airport porters, bartenders, etc giving them stock tips in the run up to the crash. GME went from WSB play getting a little news coverage to a global phenomenon in a week. 

I didn't see how it was gonna get screwed up, but cheaters never stop cheating. Tthe prospect of a 100 billion dollar loss on GameStop was going to bring out the worst of Wall Street. Also, I paid attention to the news story about the Korean fund that bought GME low and then dumped it for a billion dollars in profit. When big money takes a pay day, its better to go with the flow than fight the tide.

In 5.5 shares @ 88

Out @ 360 a share

Looking to jump in long term once hype is done. Im expecting sub 40 within the year (but I also expect it to run up at least one more time; I'd rather park money in Apple and sleep well).

Thanks, great work! Also shows who amplify the hedge manipulation, whether through laziness or on the take.  The hedge against WSB started with $AG hype and lies to drive Silver

Using $AG which for a few million and targetted articles/ interventions to build positive sentiment can spike price, then do the media/research circuit and connect it directly to the full commodity market to shift sentiment in silver into a rocket stock like GME! and also direct some new wsb money away from the Gamestonk!

Well played I say. Genius! These guys aren't stupid so we shouldnt be either!

Thanks to your post of the chain of events, its much clearer who are lazy at best, criminal at worst.

It would have cost a few million to do but a smart way to maximise impact using AG >> SLV to make it also seem that a subreddit with no common strategy, full of degenerates making big bets and laughing at losses is dangerous to stable industries. People think wsb is bigger than it is because Melvin created the fear in stable markets through silver. What BS.

But we should also realise this gives WSB more influence today than it has financially which is why people are jumping into a movement that wasnt original intention of GME play or wsb. I am new here but thats what I read from OG Apes. Just saying the narrative is against wsb which brings people to wsb not interested in next big play here, but want to make sure that it is still possible for retail to make a big bet/play - if this narrative plays out and limits get put on our trading to ""protect"" us.. Some peeps wanna stick it to the man, not me, just don't want them to use this to lock down our involvement in the market as well as in our homes. With no trading... my only freedom will be which streaming service to subscribe to, or which of my wives boyfriends should blow first.  

The reality is Melvin through Plotkin made extreme dangerous short bets and doubled down with customer money then took even more extreme steps to limit losses that involved some form of help from a friend/collusion with a competing hedgefund and the owner of App and retail flows from RobinHood. Yellen gets involved as a backstop to make sure the SEC knows who is in charge and (was?) on Citadels payroll with ethics waiver in hand...

When I read comments from other hedge fund managers that go short there is a shock of not only Plotkins bet but the fact that he used PUTS which exposed his idiot position.

a good explanation from hedge fund manager of what hedge funds sometimes need to do.

1144,BB," I've been invested in physical silver and silver miners for a while, which is a pretty frustrating place to be honestly, because the FED and the bullion banks constantly suppress the price (in order to sustain the illusion of a somewhat strong USD).  


That silver post was the thing that led me to WSB in the first place, and naturally I was pretty excited by it all. Especially after seeing GME moonbound, which was a party I was unfortunately late to.  


I am pretty surprised to see the level of scepticism in here regarding silver, and the guys like me, who like silver as an investment and a store of value. In a reddit group like this with over 6 million users, I find it weird that there is not really room for anything else than GME/AMC/BB/NOK pump. Even to the point of deleting or hiding posts, that do not stick to the script of pumping these tickers.  


The way I see it, the timing of that first silver post, was pretty unfortunate, because it could seem like it diverted attention away from GME. In the media it certainly did, but among the holders of GME and the general WSB community, did it really do that?  Did many GME-holders sell their shares to go buy silver? That is not my impression. In fact I have not seen a single example in here of someone claiming to have done that?  


The silver move faded, as you know. For now. Bullion banks shorted it back in place as they always do. For now. The FUD campaign, mistrust, censorship and total lack of support by the WSB community didn't really help us old silverbugs either.  


There are fishy accounts.. Bots... People with hidden agendas... I no longer doubt that.  
Their interest is not to create a big bullish move in silver, I think that is quite clear, if you just take a look at the silver chart?  
Rather, if anything, their agenda must be to create division within WSB, or to start some kind of stupid war between old WSB users and new users, or between GME gang and silver bugs?  


I feel like too many people in here are seeing this the wrong way. That silver and people who like silver stocks (like me), are not the enemy here. Us fighting among each other is the ""enemy"", because not only is it a waste of time, but it is also hurtful to both camps.

BUT a new company called AEW is picking up steam and potentially will become legit competition. One driving factor is their action figure line which is a big deal in wrestling.

WWE is a somewhat safe bet because they have no real competition in their market, so it would take a lot for the company to fail, but in particular with their business practices I don't see them going much higher than they are now. Their attempts to expand have often fallen flat and Vince's other business ventures usually fail, eg XFL. WWE is in a spot where it's too big for its niche but can't expand past that, they've often been very out of touch with pop culture, for instance their push of Tout or their use of certain celebrities who are completely washed up.

GameStop could call a proxy vote on something or offer a special dividend to have lenders recall shares.

The apparent decline in SI could be due to sneaky market manipulation based on MM hedging.

The short volume ratio has been really high lately and if shorts haven't been covering a lot that could mean a very high SI again.

1327,AMC," A few points:

GME is trading at 25x its 52-week low. It's a category of stores that was already doing worse than the retail sector pre-pandemic. The rest of the retail sector has had decent momentum, so I also don't see a big wave it could ride on. As far as why it's trading so high, just look how long VW's price stayed way above its pre-squeeze price, post-squeeze.

AMC is trading at 3.6x its 52-week low. It's in one of the sectors that's had no momentum since the crash, as theaters are still closed - the sector is basically dead, but revivable. They also can't bankrupt it, and if they drive the price down enough, it'll get bought out. That may be the point it goes up quick, but shorts will get out before the news comes out (there's plenty of time for them to get out slowly at the crazy volume we're seeing). Don't think they'll get squeezed, but it's definitely worth more than the current price IMO.

I'm not necessarily a veteran myself, but I do have 2 years going at this, so let me share some insights with you.

If you're thinking of doing this, you can't. Or at least you'll find very limited success.

If you have less than $25,000 available in funds, you're limited to 3 day trades a week. This is not a Robinbood rule, this is an SEC rule that applies to all traders, regardless of your broker.

What constitutes a day trade?

Say you buy 5 ABC on Monday during trading hours. If you sell 2 ABC that same Monday during trading hours, that's a day trade.

If you buy 10 ABC just before market close on Tuesday, and you sell them at market open on Wednesday, that's not a day trade and doesn't count towards your 3 strikes.

If you enter into Monday already holding 10 ABC, you buy 10 more on Monday during trading hours and you sell off 8 before market close on Monday, that's not a day trade (because you already started with 10, so you can sell up to 10 before the day trade strike kicks in, deapite the fact that you bought 10 more).

I highly suggest you familiarize yourself with the rules before trying to day trade. There's much more to it than this.",70U1E,84,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leift2/you_guys_know_that_day_traders_are_still_making/gmdx5wl/,0.053,0.896,0.051,0.1739

So if $10 is as low as it can reasonably go then it doesn‚Äôt make sense to hedge with puts at $10.

1517,AMC," AMC is not a good buy. Given the massive loss in sales and the possibility of bankruptcy, it's best to avoid. Yes, the price is cheaper, but it will land a lot lower.

GME on the other hand has significant sales and expected growth due to covid. Not that you should buy either, but it's best to avoid AMC.

Edit:
Sorry to be the pessimist here. 
They're losing over 200 million per quarter due to Covid. Their stock price is higher than it was before covid. It doesn't seem likely that things will turn around anytime soon. I'm not sure what there is going for them.

I just think that smaller audience is generally willing to part with more money than your typical Logitech customer. Same outcome, different reasons.

I understand that it is 2 strong companies combining into a much stronger industry position, but Is there any actual reason to believe TLRY rockets up at merger or in the near future as a short play instead of a long one?",IamaLlamaGod,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lehg4a/sndl_dd_2621/gmh7k13/,0.051,0.775,0.174,0.9294

Here are some useful excerpts:




>Despite the widespread criticism, not all naked short selling is abusive.  Some naked short selling occurs unintentionally when a short seller, in line with current regulation, locates shares to borrow (or has reasonable belief that shares can be located and borrowed), but for some reason is unable to borrow the stock in time for delivery.  Further, some naked short selling is due to market making.






> FTDs can also arise from various processing errors, delays in obtaining physical stock certificates or human error in entering the incorrect stock symbol. 






Source: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228260887_Naked_Short_Sales_and_Fails_to_Deliver_An_Overview_of_Clearing_and_Settlement_Procedures_for_Stock_Trades_in_the_US








FTD's occur with every stock and if a stock has a lot more volume than before and many firms are trying to buy, sell, borrow, and short brokerages may not be able to do all of these things properly or as quickly as needed. So, it natural for a stock like GME to have more FTD's than other stocks and more FTD's than it's had before.

Manipulating the price down to the level it is right now through trading would take billions daily.

And, it wouldn't even work since any one else would just buy up the cheap shares since the price was manipulated. I don't know what more proof you want. Wall Street wants to make money. Manipulating the price using billions of dollars doesn't really help that at all.

>It's also impossible to imagine stops being triggered by this imaginary selling to also accelerate the drop. It's also extra impossible to imagine someone like Jim Cramer admitting to a scheme like this.







Cramer didn't admit to anything like this. Cramer said he you a few million to move the price of a stock up or down a bit so that shorts/options were better priced.

No. Because you aren't understanding my argument and why I linked that site. When I read that post everyone misunderstood what the 177% was referring to. This could have changed but at the time this was true. That link explains why it could be reported that over 100% of float is owned. 




I used the link to prove as an explanation of how ownership of float could be reported about 100%. It had nothing to do with anything else. The fact that short-selling could lead to over 100% has nothing to do with my argument or why that site was linked. And, it doesn't contradict my usage of the site at all. Since, I wasn't using the site to imply that short-selling was low; I was using it just as an explanation of why over a 100% ownership was reported.

This is when I came back to reality. 

When I realized how long I‚Äôm going to have to wait to see a return if I held my entire position -vs- reducing my position and taking that amount to flip on short flip positions. 

Then it occurred to me, I made one of the biggest options trading mistakes with these two stocks.

1743,AAPL," Yes and no. For a calendar spread, you might want the short end (the sell) to expire out of the money, then you can sell another call against the long end. But more often, you want it to rise, and then you roll it over to a higher amount a few weeks out to get an additional credit.  

That way your long leg continues to increase in value while you keep rolling out your short ends further closer to the long. 

Eventually, you can either roll your long end, or allow it to expire with your sell as a simple debit spread. By then, your sell credits have likely paid off your entire initial investment (plus some profit) and the spread exercise is entirely profit.  

For a simple debit spread, you want the buy and the sell to expire in the money, and as soon as possible, to achieve the maximum gain. You let both ends get exercised, and you collect the difference. Many at-the-money $1 spreads can be bought for around $0.35-$0.45 a week out, so you get a nice return for a relatively safe short-term position... as long as the stock doesn‚Äôt take a shit. Or you can get deep in the money spreads for $0.60-0.70. Potentially 30% to 100%+ per week depending upon your risk tolerance. 

But you‚Äôll never get anything screenshot worthy.  

With my AMC, BB, PLTR, and KOD.K spreads, I‚Äôve already recouped my initial investment through the sale of calls over the past three weeks. The AAPL spread paid for itself in the earnings runup last week. They‚Äôre all free money at this point. The AAPL long is for end of May, the rest are Jan 2022, so there‚Äôs a lot of credits left to get. The higher the stock goes, the more I can get both long and short term, so I don‚Äôt worry about hoping the sells stay out of the money.

The AAPL spread paid for itself in the earnings runup last week. They‚Äôre all free money at this point. The AAPL long is for end of May, the rest are Jan 2022, so there‚Äôs a lot of credits left to get. The higher the stock goes, the more I can get both long and short term, so I don‚Äôt worry about hoping the sells stay out of the money.

Of course, I don‚Äôt necessarily know what I‚Äôm doing, and this certainly isn‚Äôt advice or any kind of recommendation.
