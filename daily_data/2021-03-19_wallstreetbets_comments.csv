9,DD," You know, I was reading this DD on Robinhood and I think I know what happens. So, you scroll Reddit, and everyone is talking about PLTR, so you run out and buy PLTR on WeBull or Robinhood. Now the shares you buy aren't really shares but something called margin, which comes from the word margarine. It's like butter vs chemicals that look like butter. Same thing. So you buy stock but you really don't own that stock, the platform does. So suddenly 1 million people buy PLTR and Robinhood and Webull then take the OPPOSITE position and loan out those shares to short against you to cause you to lose money on purpose. Catch is, when you buy 50 shares, they only really buy 25 because they know you will ultimately lose, and ultimately sell. So the trick is to avoid meme stocks and instead buy quiet stocks few know about where you are the oddball because then you won't likely be shorted as much.

So it‚Äôs not like everybody knows that their order flow is routed to HFs who can front run the orders or do the complete opposite and short the stock.

Not to mention, Robinhood doesn‚Äôt buy physical shares for you.

Also, my suggestion, if you don‚Äôt have time sensitive stock on Robinhood, like you don‚Äôt need to sell a stock soon because a potential big market move, I would do a partial transfer to your TDA account.

Thank you everyone for all of the awards and kind words. You do not understand just how much all of that means to me. I've been going through some really dark times and being able to do this for you all has really kept me going these past few weeks.

This is such an incredible community and I hope everyone realizes how lucky we are to be a part of something like this. Regardless of what happens, please realize that we are a part of history during an event that will be talked about for generations.

I'm so excited to see where this goes and what the end result will be.

**4:33 Update**

Multiple sites showed a different end. I have everything consolidating to 200.27. That was fucking close. 

I'll make a more detailed recap of today at some point this weekend. I have a lot to process.

Thank you all for joining me in this journey. I hope you all are having fun. Enjoy the weekend, and I'll see you all next week.

Current price: 200.27

**4:00 Update**

Holy Fuck.

Current price: 202.44

**3:56 Update**

It's going down again. Is velocity enough?

4 minutes remain.

Current price: 202.23

**3:53 Update**

GME has stalled. 6 minutes remain.

Current price: 203.91

**3:47 Update**

GME seems to have stalled. Are the HFs done?

Current price: 204.46

**3:41 Update**

Current price: 203.32

**3:27 Update**

[The juggling continues](https://i.imgur.com/CxTGMBW.png), and so does GME's very slow descent. I'm honestly really impressed that they're still able to keep going. I wish I had access to more information to see what exactly is happening.

I still don't think that they'll make it below 200, but if the current velocity persists, it's going to be really fucking close.

Anything can happen. Enjoy the ride. Journey before destination.

Current price: 204.13

**3:11 Update**

It looks like they do indeed still have some firepower. The shorts available keep fluctuating by a few hundred every 15 minutes or so. I've never seen this since I've been keeping tabs on IBorrowDesk. They're essentially juggling desperately trying to get some sort of foothold.

45 minutes left. Can they somehow get it below 200?

Shorts available: 300

Current price: 208.15

**2:53 Update**

LOL 

It definitely looks like they just ran out of ammo.

All aboard!

üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Current price: 213.80

**2:43 Update**

This is starting to look eerily like what happened yesterday. Slow decline starting before 2, making it's way towards 200. Do they have enough firepower left to make this move again? If this goes like yesterday, we should see a spike down at around 3.

Happy Power Hour y'all!

Current price: 207.70

**2:24 Update**

At this point, I'm going to have to assume that either they're getting shorts from ETFs or somewhere that doesn't report their availability. 5,700 shorts were borrowed, but I'm not sure if that amount would cause the current downward trend. We'll see how long this continues. I'll be impressed if GME drops below 200 again. 

Current shorts: 400 (LOL)

Current price: 206.63

**1:50 Update**

I don't know what the HFs are doing at this point. They took out another 2,000 shorts, but if anything, the price has bumped slightly up. There's still a of volatility, but it seems to still be stabalized around 213. We might see one more major price change before the end of the day, but don't be surprised if this is where we end up.

Shorts available: 6,000

Current price: 211.79

**1:25 Update**

Volume seems to be dying off, which means that the lunchtime rush has calmed. A lot of stuff has happened and GME is currently settled at around 212. A lot of changes have happened with the shorts available which I can't really pin down. They keep going up and down, but we're only taking about 1k amounts instead of the usual 100k amounts we've been seeing in the past. This makes pinning the shorts to stock movement difficult to guess. I'm still not 100% sure how much of the 12:30 run was shorts closing and how much was retail. Just as I'm not sure how much of the recent drop is from shorts being dropped and general retail selloff. 

Regardless, GME is in the green and would go into the weekend with a really strong position if it closes at this price point.

Shorts available: 9,000

Current price: 213.96

**1:04 Update**

I think the HFs are flailing and desperate to stop GMEs current climb. They're failing miserably.

I'm starting to believe that the 12:30 spike occurred due to shorts closing. Here's the thing, shorts available only climbed up 10,000. During that time? GME spiked up nearly $10.

I hope you all realize how fucking insane the implications of that are. If 7,000 shorts close and the price jumps up $10, what kind of jump will we see when MILLIONS of shorts close at this point.

Shorts available have since gone back down to 8,000, but GME continues to push back up to 220.

Shorts available: 8,000

Current price: 219.01

**12:52 Update**

GME has consolidated down to around 216. We saw this type of consolidation happen right after the 12:00 rally as well. Next round of people go to lunch at 1, so let's see if there's another spike at that point.

Remember when they were fighting for 200? 

Current price: $216.78

Like who ever said that the quadruple mega ultra witching was upon us and FOR SURE the analysis is clear that this Friday would be the day. Oh. Everyone said that. Well, 99% of you.

1% of people are saying hold long term, whether they are right or not, they aren't doing what you're doing, which is the opposite of what you want to do. Inspiring people to hold through losses Friday because Monday it will surely moon this time.

People will just dump on Monday when you're wrong.

The bet here is there's literally millions of hidden shorts somewhere on cooked books. The upside is the chance that is correct. Since that's what we are betting on, obviously nobody fucking knows if it's true, and if it is true, when it would show itself, and if it did show itself, what would actually happen.

I'm taking that bet, but man is it fucking hard when every fucking comment is a witch doctor predicting a moon tomorrow. Perpetually tomorrow.

* Pierce has been short since $30 and is constantly trying to spread FUD, but does a hilariously bad job at it(like, he gets the school newspaper to run a piece on how leading market analysts have found that everyone who holds GME is gay and the short interest is actually minus 500% or smt, dropping a dead cat off the roof to illustrate the uptick is just a dead cat bounce, etc.)
* Annie obviously has a meticulously balanced and diversified portfolio so well hedged that price drops don't even affect her
* Britta is constantly and loudly talking about diamond hands this and it's about the cause that but at the end of the second act it's revealed that she has been paper handing every dip and buying in higher than she sold constantly so she's further in the red than Melvin Capital
* Jeff is the guy telling everyone to chill and not even look at the price of the stock for a while because it'll only make them nervous, but we get several scenes with him completely losing his shit when he's alone at home, in the hallway between classes or in the bathroom, obsessing over every cent of movement
* Shirley did her own DD after Abed recommended the stock, bought in early and sold at her set target somewhere around $100. When confronted about her ""betrayal"" by the group, she tells them they're all being insane and she's going home to have a nice day trip with her children.

Well let's imagine that there's only one monopolistic internalizer trading a security, and that internalizer is internalizing all the retail volume trying to buy a security. Even if millions of retail traders are buying the security, **the stock price on the open market wouldn't move, there would be no volume on the open market, and the internalizer would have a massive short position on the stock that they have to unload.** What this looks like in the world of green and red candles is a **massive bull flag while the internalizer is internalizing** and **massive upward breakouts when the internalizer unloads their short position**.""

Holy fuck this actually explains why BB hasn't really moved. I'm deep into BB since the last breakout and have cost averaging my positions none stop. I ran numbers on fundamentals and did a bunch of chart analysis and I was predicting, by at least this week that BB was going to pop again. Everything was lining up, news on security, Baidu, Amazon I thought for sure we'd get a pop. If you notice the volume has tripled! But still, we got NOTHING! Then I noticed this week when I thought we'd get a pop, the share float has ballooned up. Some real manipulation going on here and this explains it. They're probably internalizing a massive short position on BB and stabilizing the price. This is fucking bullshit. I had to rollover an option I had for March 19 today.

In this sub since day one, it has been stressed repeatedly to not to put any money into it that you can't afford to throw away.

The shelf was controversial and I hated it at the time. But you have to consider the time. GME had just reported lackluster earnings and given no guidance. It was trading in the $15-$20 range. $100M was a big potential dilution.

I'd call it nearly negligence not to take advantage of the chance to do a big capital raise at present prices. Its 1/10th the dilution it would have been when created...

To be fair, if the squeeze is squoze the way alot of people have been suggesting then HFs holding large short positions and synthetic shares would have to sell other positions to raise capital.

597,GME," I'm sure HF's will hedge against any serious losses... that is what they are experts in, not all but most.

I mean, retail literally has no clue what is happening.

&#x200B;

1. Basically what everyone says could be happening(HF's overplayed their position).
2. HF's could be entirely setting up retail by putting on this show that the HF's overplayed their position when they did not... basically extracting billions from retail and some institutional investors.
3. RC could be involved in such a scheme. The idea is that he invests a few mil in to GME, takes control, tanks the stock, profits(he shorts the stock himself). he could be working with others.
4. etc

&#x200B;

The idea is that no one knows what the hell is going on. No one can trust the data but many do. If we assume that much of the data cannot be faked then it suggests 1 is the probable case but that doesn't mean MOASS. In fact we might have seen the last squeeze already and GME might just go back to 20$ a share.

&#x200B;

Now, we have quadruple witching, earnings release, etc coming and if GME does the right shit then we can potentially see significant increase in stock value.

&#x200B;

If/when GME converts to ecommerce that could make the 200 value of the stock meaningful. This really only means, though, that those who bought in when it was 4-180ish will make any real money. It could spike higher, to 400 or 1000 or maybe larger depending on circumstances(but there is an actual limit since people will sale to profit even though that actually reduces their over potential(but they do lock it in).

&#x200B;

Now if the HF's have been naked short selling over 100% then basically manipulating the stock to profit they might be in a hole they cannot get out of.

&#x200B;

Suppose there are 100 stocks and 1 stock was fabricated(naked short sold beyond all the stocks that exist and used FTD's to hide it). There is no way to fabricate that stock(except having the brokerages and DTCC allow it).

E.g., suppose you are the short seller and you naked short that 101th stock. Now you have to buy that stock back. Suppose there is one seller who will sell it to you. Ok, so you bought it and ""covered"" your position. There is still 101 stock at large. All that has effectively done is the shorter became that buyer and that original buyer(now seller) got out. Still 101 stocks floating around.

&#x200B;

If one creates a stock out of thin air the only way to get rid of it is to destroy that stock. If you make 100 voodoo dolls and someone makes one forgery then there are 101 voodoo dolls with 1 being fake. That will never change until one is destroyed(and it has to technically be the fake except with stock they don't really make such a distinction like they should).

&#x200B;

The issue is that people believe there are 100 dolls and yet there are 101. That makes the dolls seem rarer than they actually are(well, the legit dolls are still just as rare but in the buying and selling game there is more surplus than what people think).

E.g., suppose there are 100 legit stocks and 100 fabricated. People think there are only 100 yet 200 are actually being traded. The fabricator then has extracted the total value of the 100 legit stocks and has that in his pocket and the stock is overvalued by 2x.

The only way to make this a zero sum game is for the fabricator to give back the value he extracted. The stock market, if legit, is suppose to be zero sum(minus trading fee's).

&#x200B;

So, if the short position was ever over 100% it basically is impossible to be rectified except for someone to lose whatever the fake shares cost. This could be done by making retail lose(trick them in to selling then ditching the fake stock), the government/brokerages/DTCC eating the cost(cheaters win then) and removing the fake shares, or the cheaters having to give back what they stole.

There is ultimately no other way to fix such a problem.  Of course they could just let it continue but then the problem just gets worse and worse or GME could pretend they create new shares to cover the fake shares, not actually sell them but claim they did(this is the same as selling the shares to the cheaters at 0$) but this would just be rewarding the cheaters.

&#x200B;

When a shorter shorts a stock they are selling stock that doesn't exist so they have to buy stock to nullify that at some point in the future. If they short more stock than exists it is impossible for them to buy it all back. At best they can only buy 100% of the stock.

&#x200B;

If you sell 200 voodoo dolls before you actually own them and all you can get your hands on is 100 voodoo dolls where are you going to get the other 100? You can't. You can fabricate the 100 and that might let you get away and cover it up, but now there are 200 dolls on the market, not 100, so each doll is actually worth 1/2 of what it is suppose to be worth. Yet on one hand people are still paying the same price but supply and demand will try to drive down the price to 1/2 of the value.

This is important: If the people are paying X for a stock and the fabricated stock makes the price worth, say, 1/2X then 1. People are being ripped off. 2. People that buy in when the price was low(e.g., when GME was 4$) will make a killing if/when the problem is fixed and the price goes back to X. (e.g., they would double their money)

So, IF what is happening is that the shorters truly have shorted 100%+ of the stock, depending on how much, they have devalued the stock by that percentage and so buyers of the devalued stock will be able to reap the profits if/when it is fixed.

&#x200B;

This might be why we are seeing GME so high, it's value was always around 200$ a share, the shorters drove it down to 5$ a share, that is 40 times lower and behind the scenes they have been having to rectify the situation and it's finally stabilizing at around 200$. It could be the stock is worth 40$ and then it would be only a 10x factor and it's overpriced because of retail/demand.

There are complicating factors though such as the options market, other shorters, etc.

&#x200B;

If this is what is going on I don't think anyone has any clue how bad it is. It could be enough to totally collapse the markets or basically they will slowly deflate the bubble so no one will know. It kinda depends on what GS does. They might be forced to go along with the charade and not make things ""worse"" for the economy.

&#x200B;

What we do know is that the retail investors will be the ones screwed at the end of the day because there is no way in hell the HF billionaires are going to admit they are thieves. Unless, of course, this is so bit it can't be pushed under the rug.

&#x200B;

Basically the shorters can be screwed IF buyers buy and hold. The shorters can keep shorting and manipulating the price and the brokerages will let them fabricate shares but as supply runs out there will be a MOASS as long as people hold. If that happens, who knows.

&#x200B;

If RC is on the side of retail(and IMO that is in his best interest unless he is playing both sides just for the $$$, which he might be) then GS can definitely cause this bubble to inflate by a factor of at least 10 or even 100. 200$ a share could go to 20k$ a share. This would then trigger the options chains and writers would be screwed out of their potential profit and a gamma squeeze would occur... then a vega squeeze(as volatility would skyrocket). You are then looking at 100k to 1M a share.  But this is impossible since there isn't enough money in the world to cover the positions... so at some point it all breaks down or the oligarchs make shit happen just like they did with Espstein and this could screw over retail(since retail always gets screwed over).

It might end up like ""Ryan, if you dilute your shares(to cover the fabricated ones) we will give you 10B"".. then shorters get to cover, RC gets his fat check, DFV cashes in, and retail gets diluted and loses.

I sure hope that is not the case. GS isn't the first company to be over shorted. It's happened many times. 2008 was one of those instances as was the dot com. Many billionaires made their billions by fucking over the economy and hurting a lot of people.

It kinda depends on what GS does. They might be forced to go along with the charade and not make things ""worse"" for the economy.

&#x200B;

What we do know is that the retail investors will be the ones screwed at the end of the day because there is no way in hell the HF billionaires are going to admit they are thieves. Unless, of course, this is so bit it can't be pushed under the rug.

&#x200B;

Basically the shorters can be screwed IF buyers buy and hold. The shorters can keep shorting and manipulating the price and the brokerages will let them fabricate shares but as supply runs out there will be a MOASS as long as people hold. If that happens, who knows.

&#x200B;

If RC is on the side of retail(and IMO that is in his best interest unless he is playing both sides just for the $$$, which he might be) then GS can definitely cause this bubble to inflate by a factor of at least 10 or even 100. 200$ a share could go to 20k$ a share. This would then trigger the options chains and writers would be screwed out of their potential profit and a gamma squeeze would occur... then a vega squeeze(as volatility would skyrocket). You are then looking at 100k to 1M a share.  But this is impossible since there isn't enough money in the world to cover the positions... so at some point it all breaks down or the oligarchs make shit happen just like they did with Espstein and this could screw over retail(since retail always gets screwed over).

It might end up like ""Ryan, if you dilute your shares(to cover the fabricated ones) we will give you 10B"".. then shorters get to cover, RC gets his fat check, DFV cashes in, and retail gets diluted and loses.

I sure hope that is not the case. GS isn't the first company to be over shorted. It's happened many times. 2008 was one of those instances as was the dot com. Many billionaires made their billions by fucking over the economy and hurting a lot of people.

600,RC," I'm sure HF's will hedge against any serious losses... that is what they are experts in, not all but most.

I mean, retail literally has no clue what is happening.

&#x200B;

1. Basically what everyone says could be happening(HF's overplayed their position).
2. HF's could be entirely setting up retail by putting on this show that the HF's overplayed their position when they did not... basically extracting billions from retail and some institutional investors.
3. RC could be involved in such a scheme. The idea is that he invests a few mil in to GME, takes control, tanks the stock, profits(he shorts the stock himself). he could be working with others.
4. etc

&#x200B;

The idea is that no one knows what the hell is going on. No one can trust the data but many do. If we assume that much of the data cannot be faked then it suggests 1 is the probable case but that doesn't mean MOASS. In fact we might have seen the last squeeze already and GME might just go back to 20$ a share.

&#x200B;

Now, we have quadruple witching, earnings release, etc coming and if GME does the right shit then we can potentially see significant increase in stock value.

&#x200B;

If/when GME converts to ecommerce that could make the 200 value of the stock meaningful. This really only means, though, that those who bought in when it was 4-180ish will make any real money. It could spike higher, to 400 or 1000 or maybe larger depending on circumstances(but there is an actual limit since people will sale to profit even though that actually reduces their over potential(but they do lock it in).

&#x200B;

Now if the HF's have been naked short selling over 100% then basically manipulating the stock to profit they might be in a hole they cannot get out of.

&#x200B;

Suppose there are 100 stocks and 1 stock was fabricated(naked short sold beyond all the stocks that exist and used FTD's to hide it). There is no way to fabricate that stock(except having the brokerages and DTCC allow it).

E.g., suppose you are the short seller and you naked short that 101th stock. Now you have to buy that stock back. Suppose there is one seller who will sell it to you. Ok, so you bought it and ""covered"" your position. There is still 101 stock at large. All that has effectively done is the shorter became that buyer and that original buyer(now seller) got out. Still 101 stocks floating around.

&#x200B;

If one creates a stock out of thin air the only way to get rid of it is to destroy that stock. If you make 100 voodoo dolls and someone makes one forgery then there are 101 voodoo dolls with 1 being fake. That will never change until one is destroyed(and it has to technically be the fake except with stock they don't really make such a distinction like they should).

&#x200B;

The issue is that people believe there are 100 dolls and yet there are 101. That makes the dolls seem rarer than they actually are(well, the legit dolls are still just as rare but in the buying and selling game there is more surplus than what people think).

E.g., suppose there are 100 legit stocks and 100 fabricated. People think there are only 100 yet 200 are actually being traded. The fabricator then has extracted the total value of the 100 legit stocks and has that in his pocket and the stock is overvalued by 2x.

The only way to make this a zero sum game is for the fabricator to give back the value he extracted. The stock market, if legit, is suppose to be zero sum(minus trading fee's).

&#x200B;

So, if the short position was ever over 100% it basically is impossible to be rectified except for someone to lose whatever the fake shares cost. This could be done by making retail lose(trick them in to selling then ditching the fake stock), the government/brokerages/DTCC eating the cost(cheaters win then) and removing the fake shares, or the cheaters having to give back what they stole.

There is ultimately no other way to fix such a problem.  Of course they could just let it continue but then the problem just gets worse and worse or GME could pretend they create new shares to cover the fake shares, not actually sell them but claim they did(this is the same as selling the shares to the cheaters at 0$) but this would just be rewarding the cheaters.

&#x200B;

When a shorter shorts a stock they are selling stock that doesn't exist so they have to buy stock to nullify that at some point in the future. If they short more stock than exists it is impossible for them to buy it all back. At best they can only buy 100% of the stock.

&#x200B;

If you sell 200 voodoo dolls before you actually own them and all you can get your hands on is 100 voodoo dolls where are you going to get the other 100? You can't. You can fabricate the 100 and that might let you get away and cover it up, but now there are 200 dolls on the market, not 100, so each doll is actually worth 1/2 of what it is suppose to be worth. Yet on one hand people are still paying the same price but supply and demand will try to drive down the price to 1/2 of the value.

This is important: If the people are paying X for a stock and the fabricated stock makes the price worth, say, 1/2X then 1. People are being ripped off. 2. People that buy in when the price was low(e.g., when GME was 4$) will make a killing if/when the problem is fixed and the price goes back to X. (e.g., they would double their money)

So, IF what is happening is that the shorters truly have shorted 100%+ of the stock, depending on how much, they have devalued the stock by that percentage and so buyers of the devalued stock will be able to reap the profits if/when it is fixed.

&#x200B;

This might be why we are seeing GME so high, it's value was always around 200$ a share, the shorters drove it down to 5$ a share, that is 40 times lower and behind the scenes they have been having to rectify the situation and it's finally stabilizing at around 200$. It could be the stock is worth 40$ and then it would be only a 10x factor and it's overpriced because of retail/demand.

There are complicating factors though such as the options market, other shorters, etc.

&#x200B;

If this is what is going on I don't think anyone has any clue how bad it is. It could be enough to totally collapse the markets or basically they will slowly deflate the bubble so no one will know. It kinda depends on what GS does. They might be forced to go along with the charade and not make things ""worse"" for the economy.

607,GME," When a person naked shorts a share they are creating a share out of thin air because the brokerages don't necessary make sure that share is actually covered or borrowed. They assume that at some point in the future the share will be bought back... but what if it isn't?

What if 100 shares are shorted but no one is selling them to be covered? Then what? If someone shorts a share it is fabricating a share temporarily. Else how the hell could you short a share in the first place? If you could never create a share out of nothing you couldn't sell something you never had.

Fabricating shares is what shorting is.... but brokerages are suppose to make sure when someone shorts that they borrow it from a buyer so that if the buyer sells they will sell it to the short. This then would at most allow for a max open short position of 100%.  (this would assume every buyer would end up selling to a shorter to cover the short)

But because there is lag in the system and a bunch of hocus pocus by the brokerages and hedge funds all kinds of crazy shit can happen. FTD's can be used to fabricate more shares than can be covered. Buyers don't have to sell to shorters. Buyers don't even have to sell(although greed makes this one rarer).

The idea is simple. What if 100 shares exist and 100 buyers have them and 100 shorters short them.  You now have 200 shares in ""existence"" 100 fake shares(the shares created so shorters could sell) and the 100 legit shares the buyers own. What if the buyers did not sell? Well, the basic idea is that shorters have to pay interest to the brokerages on those fake shares(which the brokerages love) so eventually the shorters will end up buying a share from a buyer(assuming there is one) to stop losing money(or to make money) and that will then balance the equation. The brokerage will unfabricate the share they created for the shorter. All this is essentially fine and dandy. Sure fake shares were created but one ends up with a ""liquid market"" and supposedly an ""efficient market"". The problem is when things to go as planned and the shorters short more shares than exist or buyers don't sell. In the first case the time interval that the fabricated stock exists goes to infinity since now it is impossible to buy every stock back.

E.g., if you have 100 owners and 100 shorters then there are at least 100 owners to potentially buy stock back to rebalance the equation. But if you have 100 owners and 101 shorters how can it ever be rebalanced? There will always be that 1 fabricated stock that the can never be bought since there will only ever be 100 owners. You can't buy more than exist.

So what happens is that these fabricated stocks float around in the system and the brokerages and HF's are able to manipulate everything to keep the problem hidden. FTD's are used to constantly shuffle all the fabricated shit around. Shorters are still able to short further increasing the problem. In fact, over time if this scenario happens one just gets more and more fabricated shares because buyers are not always selling to shorters. When more shorters come in it exacerbates the problem.

With GME, this is what happened when it was heavily shorted and then retail came in to drive up the price. It caused the shorters to hold, but more shorters came in to short. This created more fabricated stock. As more retail came in to drive up the price the shorters held the stock more creating more fabricated stock. This ended up creating probably several orders of magnitude of fabricated stock, probably 5-20 times. Why? Because shorters are not going to buy back stock at 300$ when they shorted at 4 or 10 or 20 or 40 or 50 or 100. They will just wait for it to go back down(or short some more to try drive it down). At first it is not a huge deal, although scary, but at some point it becomes very scary since they could lose billions overall. At 400$ one literally has multiplied the losses by 100 and one doesn't even know if that is the ceiling. They are losing money on interest too and this means less money to short the stock. 

Basically their only out is to continue to short the stock, create disinformation, etc. They have to get the stock down... but more shorters are coming in even at 200$. Everyone wants a piece of the pie. How many fake shares are floating around for months on end? what if buyers do not sell? 

So ultimately it all depends on the buyers. If they get greedy then the shorters win. It's that simple. If they can hold out for months then the shorters lose. (assuming GS, Gov, or DTCC and others don't fuck the buyers over)

The shorters and some buyers were able to drive the stock down to 40$ at one point and this let some shorters get out with ~10x the loss(but they were hedge funds so they were able to minimize this loss to some degree). Many buyers sold out to cash in and this effectively sided with the shorters and actually minimized their potential gain. Robinhood helped the shorters by limiting buys(which would have further drove the stock up).

What seems to be going on is that the shorters are doing everything they can to drive down the price using their manipulation tactics. Only time will tell if it works. There are a lot of shit at play on many fronts. HF's that bought in millions of shares at 4-100$ could sell out and this would drive the price down allowing shorters to cover. If shorters shorted along with this then they could benefit greatly.

Unfortunately greed will limit the highs. The stock will almost surely not get to 1000$ a share unless many of the right things happen at the same time. Retail will get tired of the game or don't know what is going on. If RC and GS put out really good news it could create a new push and if buyers hold and more HF's come in because of it then we might see it shoot up again. If shorters are forced to buy in and continue to lose money then it will further reduce the shorting pressure. But the shorters doing everything they can to get the price down and they are slowly doing it... will they get it down in time? Doesn't look like they will IF GS gives good news. If RC sides with the shorters then game over. The ace of the sleeve is DFV assuming he's still playing and has this all figured out and again, assuming he won't screw retail.

My take. Gamestop is almost surely going to convert over to an ecommerce. This should allow their P/E to be evaluated at a 10x ratio. If gamestop was a 20$ stock this means the stock will be valued at last 200$.  So it is essentially trading at what it is valued at right now. There will probably then be one more squeeze as everything sorta works itself out. The peak depends on the news.

This created more fabricated stock. As more retail came in to drive up the price the shorters held the stock more creating more fabricated stock. This ended up creating probably several orders of magnitude of fabricated stock, probably 5-20 times. Why? Because shorters are not going to buy back stock at 300$ when they shorted at 4 or 10 or 20 or 40 or 50 or 100. They will just wait for it to go back down(or short some more to try drive it down). At first it is not a huge deal, although scary, but at some point it becomes very scary since they could lose billions overall. At 400$ one literally has multiplied the losses by 100 and one doesn't even know if that is the ceiling. They are losing money on interest too and this means less money to short the stock. 

Basically their only out is to continue to short the stock, create disinformation, etc. They have to get the stock down... but more shorters are coming in even at 200$. Everyone wants a piece of the pie. How many fake shares are floating around for months on end? what if buyers do not sell? 

So ultimately it all depends on the buyers. If they get greedy then the shorters win. It's that simple. If they can hold out for months then the shorters lose. (assuming GS, Gov, or DTCC and others don't fuck the buyers over)

The shorters and some buyers were able to drive the stock down to 40$ at one point and this let some shorters get out with ~10x the loss(but they were hedge funds so they were able to minimize this loss to some degree). Many buyers sold out to cash in and this effectively sided with the shorters and actually minimized their potential gain. Robinhood helped the shorters by limiting buys(which would have further drove the stock up).

What seems to be going on is that the shorters are doing everything they can to drive down the price using their manipulation tactics. Only time will tell if it works. There are a lot of shit at play on many fronts. HF's that bought in millions of shares at 4-100$ could sell out and this would drive the price down allowing shorters to cover. If shorters shorted along with this then they could benefit greatly.

Unfortunately greed will limit the highs. The stock will almost surely not get to 1000$ a share unless many of the right things happen at the same time. Retail will get tired of the game or don't know what is going on. If RC and GS put out really good news it could create a new push and if buyers hold and more HF's come in because of it then we might see it shoot up again. If shorters are forced to buy in and continue to lose money then it will further reduce the shorting pressure. But the shorters doing everything they can to get the price down and they are slowly doing it... will they get it down in time? Doesn't look like they will IF GS gives good news. If RC sides with the shorters then game over. The ace of the sleeve is DFV assuming he's still playing and has this all figured out and again, assuming he won't screw retail.

My take. Gamestop is almost surely going to convert over to an ecommerce. This should allow their P/E to be evaluated at a 10x ratio. If gamestop was a 20$ stock this means the stock will be valued at last 200$.  So it is essentially trading at what it is valued at right now. There will probably then be one more squeeze as everything sorta works itself out. The peak depends on the news. Might get to 400$ or to 2000$ depending on exactly what is done... or more or less depending on all the parameters that no one actually knows.",EternalDissonance,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m830vh/twitter_thread_from_domo_capital_saying_ryan/grhbypy/,0.104,0.791,0.106,-0.8378

Those that create these policies know exactly what they are doing and pay politicians/bureaucrats to pass them then go on to exploit the holes in the policies/rules they knew about all along. The government doesn't care. The citizens are simply seen as the piggy bank. All the degradation of humanity by these lunatics doesn't matter because they are insane and it's simply all about them. Most people can't understand the butterfly effect, how something like what HF's have done to GME could, hypothetically, lead to to nuclear war. Most people are idiots, in fact everyone is an idiot. Societies are the most complex things humans have ever created. In fact there is only one society since every society is now interconnected(of which it will only become more so).  It's like people think allowing the fox to guard the hen house won't turn out bad or if they just ignore potential problems the problems go away. Literally our governments are run by psychopaths and almost all politicians are bought/installed. It only gets worse because the psychopaths only get more powerful and better at the game. Imagine what it would be like in 50 years, 100 years... your great grandchildren trying to live in such a world... all because of the way our ancestors ignored the problems, how our parents ignored them, how we ignored them.

In the 70s it would take years for a film like Star Wars to end up on CBS (there were only 4 channels at the time).

Since the mid 90s, these windows have been getting crushed and the future says Theatrical turnaround will be 3 weeks... 21 days.  Meaning, after 21 days in the theaters it will be available via Premium VOD, then Sell Through (not all, anymore), then, HBO, then streaming SVOD.

1020,AMC," In addition to 'just seeing movies' I see future potential for AMC (and movie theaters in general) in diversifying. Some of our local theaters host church services on Sunday mornings and business meetings on weeknights - in this day of COVID it still allows for good social distancing.  


Future growth potential:

Things like gaming tournaments (my kids watch hours of other people playing online), local business conferences/meetings, schools/colleges could use them as lecture halls, there are still endless possibilities out there.   


I imagine a company like Amazon, Netflix or Disney purchasing a chain of theaters and hosting Friday night viewing parties for the Mandalorian or Ozark or hell even a Tiger King binge party.  


Folks used to line up for Rocky Horror Picture show on Friday nights, movie theaters are more than a place to just watch movies - the social aspect of watching the Death Star blow up and everyone cheering is what will be (and is being) missed.

1056,DVD," I could see that being a valid concern, especially with the release of Disney+. Disney and Marvel movies were the highest earners and made up the bulk of box office revenue over the last decade. If they decided to shorten that window and put those movies on Disney+ early, that could hurt the theaters a bit.

For example, 'Frozen' was in movie theaters for over a year. That movie made a ridiculous amount of money and continued to draw in crowds for months, so Disney left in theaters and put off the DVD release. Then after the DVD was released they even re-released the movie theatrically as a sing along because it continued to make a lot of money.

A counterpoint to that would be that Disney has been withholding movies like Black Widow for a year now when they could've released it on Disney+, but they're holding out for a theatrical release to potentially make more money with the right timing.

If the business heads that direction, I think that the theaters would try arrange some kind of contract with the studios saying 'You'll let us show your movie x amount of time before you release it via VOD or a streaming platforms otherwise we won't show it'.

There's a lot of theaters open now that chose not to show 'Raya and the Last Dragon' because the contract terms weren't that favorable for the theaters.

Personally, I'd rather watch the latest movies on the big screen than at home. Marvel movies are so much better that way.

1062,AMC," I did think it through and I wholeheartedly disagree.

The big reason that another company would buy them out given the opportunity, is to lock out the competition. When I worked for Cinemark, they would keep theaters open that weren't making them any money just to keep other movie theater chains from moving in.

AMC is the largest theater chain in the world. If they had to sell, whoever bought them out would not only dominate the U.S. market, but also have a global network in place. 

Cineworld just bought out Regal a few years ago to get a footing in the U.S. and if they bought up AMC, they would have 1169 theaters in the U.S. alone, which is over twice as many theaters as Cinemark has in total.

Cinemark would buy AMC just to keep Cineworld from out numbering them 2-1.

1067,TV," I think ultimately it will come down to what is more profitable film producers, I get your let us show your movie so many times or we won't show it thing but how much power does the theater really have in that negotiation with Disney for instance. If Disney is sitting there like we have a streaming service it costs us basically nothing to put our movie out on and still get that viewership, they don't even have to make all the whatever the modern version of a film reel is for the theaters to show, they are keeping customers on their own service too. Only massive ticket prices are going to persuade them to go to/stay in theaters and that will push away business from theaters.

Here's the simple, biggest thing that really makes me really question if theaters will rebound. Here it costs (last time I went to the movies, probably 3 years ago now) like  $12 CAD or more for a regular adult movie ticket, one month of Disney plus just went up apparently to also $12 CAD. 

So if you see more than 1 movie a month you are getting value from streaming, if you have a family (2 adults 2 kids) would cost say $40 for tickets or watch on TV at home for 1 subscription.

No you lost all our money buying stonks retard, and my boyfriend isn't going to pay $36 for tickets when Disney plus is $12.",T3nEighty,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8ei9r/why_amc_is_a_buy_an_employee_perspective/grhp2p2/,0.04,0.903,0.057,0.305

1110,GME," Doesn't the Cup and Handle analysis only work if the right rim of the cup is equal to the left rim of the cup?  When they are equal it indicates a line of resistance preventing the stock from going higher; a line that will most likely be broken through when people/companies buy the dip in the ""handle"".  That's why traders look out for this pattern.

But with GME, the left from of the cup was due to a moderate short squeeze, right?  It didn't exactly hit a line of resistance, heavy investors just started selling off once it got to the mid-$300's for an insane profit. 

So idk if you can really call this pattern a cup and handle because the right rim isn't really close to the same level as the left rim.

1142,IMO," Real good advice?

Predict a trend, can go either volatile or something slower (ex: TLRY vs NVDA, one can easily move 10-30%+ in a day, the other only 5-10%.) and buy options with little money that is 10-30% from current price, 1-4 weeks out, or further(if you can even afford to buy the options), there are so many variables I can't give them all. Experiment with time and price values. take little wins until you get confident. Learn to squeeze as much out of it as you can with good risk management if you're wrong. Also your trading software should have an options profit potential graph too, if not google one to see if it's worth the call/put. Safer options with longer timeframe require more capital. If you git gud, you should expect 100%+ gains on your option. You don't need to put a lot in options to make a lot. Being right on a trend is what makes you money here.

As per Elliot Wave GME is in wave(ii) of Wave 5. I am looking at an expanded diagonal which is very rare in setups. But, again GME is also very rare phenomena. My end target is $500(conservative) and aggressive ($575).

Edit 1: Just checked your other comment. Looks like you are fellow Elliotician. You are correct we are Wave(ii) and currently doing ABC correction. Are you also looking at expanding diagonal setup. Also, we are in Super Wave 3 which per my chart is taking us to $500-$550 range. We are yet to see super Wave 5. Happy to engage in discussion.

Edit 2: At one point of time, it felt that it was .786 level but it is now resting at .618 level. By end of day, it should go back to .382 level. Remember, today is the last day of quad-witching.

Important point - Pain is temporary but gain is permanent. Hold your positions.

Edit 3: Beautiful bounce. Let‚Äôs continue this momentum. Bulls need to control and kill the bears here. We need to show bears that bulls are the boss and control the price.

Based on elliot wave formation. 1,2,3,4,5 Retracement A,B,C  
Wave A and Wave B are ""assumingly complete (Blue lines and blue letters). The GME market is bullish and now moving towards C wave (which is the biggest wave. This wave MUST past the high of wave A or else this pattern will ultimately fail and now entering bearish census.   


To find your fib levels for C wave, drawn it from high of A to B. These are your fib levels or known as resistance levels for wave C. As you can see, on the daily chart, it broke thru 23.6 and 38.2 resistance levels. The fundamentals of wave pattern is (what goes up must come down to find support to go back up) Think of this as satellites positions for refueling the rocket. However, in the midst of C wave formation, you can make a healthy assumption of when market retracement can happen through previous support lines or again fib levels. So wave C, again, will have smaller waves of 1,2,3,4,5 and retracement A,B,C. When we reached the peak of 349 last week, it was completion of wave 1 (within wave C), and now testing fib level 38.2 (twice). This means its a strong fucking support line as you can tell that it GME has not been closing below 200.   


If  GME closes below 200, it can find support at 23.6 level but any further than that means its game over. Too little momentum or volume.

1344,PDT," Well yeah. PDT is pretty much in place because of the T+2 settlement. It‚Äôs to prevent you from borrowing money that you technically should not be able to borrow due to collateral reqs. If transactions were instantaneously settled, there would be no need for it. But your broker has to be able to protect itself in the event of a break in the settling chain.

Example: I spend my $1000 on XYZ, then sell it for $1010 before day ends. Technically I have not spent any of my money, as the broker puts up their money to make the transaction. Both transactions go to clearing and then uh-oh, the guy who bought it for $1010 doesn‚Äôt have any money in his account- he now gets margin called, but the money isn‚Äôt there. Now imagine the mess it would create, if you could then go on and spend that $1010 (that isn‚Äôt currently there it‚Äôs somewhere in the clearing process) and repeat the process over again. Creates a potential backlog of paperwork and bullshit for everyone involved if you could do this. 

So imagine it like this: I go to the store, buy some stuff and write a check. The check doesn‚Äôt clear. But the store already spent the money I was promising to them. This leads to trouble.

He moved the headquarters of Quicken (Rocket's mortgage arm) from Livonia (suburbs) to downtown Detroit and then *paid staff* to move to downtown Detroit.

At the time, 2010, Detroit was known for its ""abandoned skyscrapers"" and nobody wanted to be there. The city continued to spiral and ultimately filled bankruptcy in 2013. Then it began to rebound, but what Rocket/Quicken did was the catalyst for the downtown rebirth. They set the stage. Within a decade you have new investment everywhere in Greater Downtown Detroit. The Pistons moved from the suburbs back to the city and now Gilbert is building a new skyscraper in the center of Downtown to fill a hole left by what was once the world's largest department store (demolished in the 1990s).

I want Rocket to do well, not only because I bought a few shares months back, but because their success is in some ways reshaping the economy of Detroit from cars to ... well ... cars still, but cars AND mortgage/tech. That's huge. So yeah, thanks Dan, for going long on Detroit.

&nbsp;

- As far as major market driving news goes, The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package. **FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%**. Extremely fuckin‚Äô bullish. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that **the central bank would tolerate some overshooting of its inflation and employment targets as the economy makes strides in recovering, and would keep monetary policy loose until more data confirms the economy is back on track**. The Federal Reserve‚Äôs assessment of the economy also helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. The Fed also played down the risk from inflation, with their projections showing a very modest and, importantly, only temporary overshoot of their 2% target. Given that the Fed‚Äôs not yanking our dicks, I think this is bullish? I don‚Äôt know man, I‚Äôm sure someone who‚Äôs smarter than me can figure it out, I just write the transcripts.

&nbsp;

- On Thursday, The Department of Labor released their weekly unemployment report. **Initial jobless claims were 770,000 vs. the 700,000** that were expected. A shockingly high 10% increase. Not good looks. Continuing claims clocked in at 4,124,000 vs. the projected 4,034,000 during the prior week.

&nbsp;

- Overall, this week felt more brutal than most. We were clearly in a bull bear reverse head and shoulders bear ascending trap wedge upside down overhand bull inverse descending double triple bear top, but I‚Äôll admit, at the time it was hard to see. I just want it to end. **SPY** actually finished the entire week down only 1%, with all the major indices following suit. Bears got fucked. Bulls got fucked. Theta gang got fucked. If you made money under these market conditions you deserve to be arrested.

&nbsp;

- In EV land, Volkswagen (**VWAGY**) had a stellar week, finishing up over 20% after announcing that the company is making a push to become the market leader in electric vehicles in Europe. The company recently announced plans to build 6 factories to produce EVs by 2030, impressing investors. The music stops here, as **TSLA** and other EV stocks got absolutely curb stomped, closing the week down roughly 6.5%. Situations like this are the reason why every time I think about buying TSLA calls, I pay a hooker half the amount to step on my balls in heels. I save money, support local business, get a good view, and experience the exact same sensation! Fuck.

&nbsp;

- Speaking of **TSLA**, on Monday, Elon went full retard, changing his title at the company to ""Technoking of Tesla"". He also brought his butt buddy and Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn along for the ride, giving him the title of the ""Master of Coin"". Thank you Elon, very cool!

&nbsp;

- **AMC** had a pretty stellar week! On Monday it was announced that theatres finally get to reopen in Los Angeles after nearly a year of shutdowns because of the pandemic. On Wednesday, it was announced that *all* theatres in California would be open by the 19th. Unironically, this is all insanely bullish news. I still think AMC is kind of a retarded investment, but those who stuck to your guns were rewarded handsomely, kudos. AMC Closed the week up 26% at 14$.

&nbsp;

- On Tuesday, **PLUG** was caught cooking their books like fucking Enron. I don‚Äôt even know how you ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù omit hundreds of millions of dollars and make such a critical ‚Äúaccounting error‚Äù on such a large scale, but here we are. PLUG finished the week down 20% at 38$. I unfortunately don‚Äôt know if this was because of them straight up creating money out of thin air, or because of the wider market selloff, since plenty clean companies also got hammered just as bad. PLUG bulls live to see another day.

&nbsp;

- **RBLX** ‚Äúinvestors‚Äù got absolutely pantsed this week, with it drilling over 20% from its Wednesday highs, going from nearly 80$ down to 65$, closing the week at 70$. To all the newly minted WSB bagholders, let me impose some wisdom on you. My general rule of thumb is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt buy anything you won‚Äôt want to explain if it tanks‚Äù. If I somehow lose money on Amazon or Apple or MSFT, whatever, I can live with those decisions. But if I have to tell someone I lost 4k on fucking Alibaba or 3k on fucking Doordash I‚Äôm gonna feel like an actual retard as I should. Don‚Äôt play anything you won‚Äôt want to explain, it‚Äôll quell your itchy trigger finger while looking at the meme plays.

&nbsp;

All in all, this week felt *heavy*. I know we technically finished down only 1%, but man, what a ride we had. I especially enjoyed the part where The Fed came in and lied to our faces about how ‚Äúinflation is under control‚Äù. When the 99 cent Arizona at the 7/11 down the road is selling for $1.40, I know something ain‚Äôt right. Regardless, the stimmy hit my account, I‚Äôm still in the green, and I‚Äôm ready to keep rolling the dice. Three things in life are certain ; death, taxes, and the March chop.

1559,EA, NOBODY would buy an EA game if there were other options for the games they play. Gamers rejoiced when the new star wars game wasn't going to be made by EA. People fucking hate EA. Roblox is a place for kids to play games but there's aspects of it where kids can actually create games. It's not as one dimensional as EA. The quality continues to increase whereas EA's quality is diminishing and usually only half complete when released (buy rest of game later via DLC).

Over the long though, I see UWMC becoming obsolete (anti-competition screams desperation, and most emotional UWMC investors are brokers themselves at risk of becoming obsolete). They're too behind on the times and the tech and have no direct/retail channel. Their sole purpose is to protect a layer of inefficiency that are the broker channel.

If you see a stock that‚Äôs appreciating on high volume, it's more likely to be a sustainable move. If you see a stock that‚Äôs appreciating on low volume, it could be a¬†dead cat bounce. Logically, when more money is moving a stock price, it means there is more demand for that stock.

If a small amount of money is moving the stock price, the odds of that move being sustainable are lower. 

The only thing holding GME up is reddit holding on to the stock and spending their stimulus checks on it.  If the volume doesn't pick up it will continue to drip away.

Preventing that is the very definition of market manipulation, and picking winners and losers, esPECially when the underlying is diving.  Preventing shorting the underlying is just as bad, but if it's HTB you may not be able to execute at a given time. That's understandable.  There is no reason I know if to prevent buying call options unless you want to prevent the stock from shooting up from a buy rush.  TDA has had plenty of safeguards in place for years anyway to prevent them from losing money on a short squeeze.

Yes, the original data suggests that we're already back above the 61.8% retrace and that our current metrics COULD lead to much higher returns moving forward, as long as volume moves it that way. But I made this basing it off of LOWER volatility, and therefore picked a part of the graph that more accurate displays current price points based on ""semi-normal"" or even ""low"" volume.

EDIT: To kind of show my point, it bounced off of $193 three times in the last 4 days. That new resistance line (which is 61.8% of the original $483-->$38.50 retrace) isn't totally incorrect.",HazelnChaCha,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m82v5d/gme_dd_why_the_fibonacci_proves_gme_isnt_done_yet/grhtguc/,0.032,0.842,0.126,0.9685
