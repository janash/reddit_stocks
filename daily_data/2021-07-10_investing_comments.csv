0,OR," Avoided buying a house for a decade listening to stuff like this but its wrong for a number of reasons:

1. It assumes people are buying with cash, which would indeed be a subpar investment. People are leveraging 4-20X with money borrowed at rates below inflation.
2. Speaking of inflation, you have to account for how much of the initial loan amount was inflated away every year. That is an implicit payment to the borrower.
3. Interest, taxes, insurance, maintenance definitely make the bulk of the expense. The only real comparison here is to measure that against the rent, which is what you would be paying otherwise OR the renter would be paying for you.

1,OR," >. It assumes people are buying with cash, which would indeed be a subpar investment. People are leveraging 4-20X with money borrowed at rates below inflation.

Over 30 years your leverage runs off, so it doesn't really provide as much benefit as you think. Although I agree it helps. 

>Speaking of inflation, you have to account for how much of the initial loan amount was inflated away every year. That is an implicit payment to the borrower

Yes, but you also get inflation + on your investments you made instead of a house. 

>Interest, taxes, insurance, maintenance definitely make the bulk of the expense. The only real comparison here is to measure that against the rent, which is what you would be paying otherwise OR the renter would be paying for you. If it is less (which isn't always the case), it is usually a good deal.

Yes you have to include rent into the calculation. But also your opportunity cost on your down payment. Markets compound typically around 8% while RE over 30 years historically has given about 3%ish. 


The only ret RE even comes close to rent plus invest is the leverage. On equivalent financing terms rent+nvesting is orders of magnitude better. The cheap government leverage just closes the gap a bit. 


The one big caveat is that RE returns are super regional so if you get a hot market you could outperform and if you get a slow market you really underperform. Just like picking stocks really.

8,BAH," It’s not impossible for military guys to save up almost all of their money while on duty (the military pays for a lot of stuff) however, given that e1 pay is about 20k a year, I’m sure you can see where even if they never touched a penny of their pay, it would take years and years to come anywhere close to purchasing a house with money from their salary in the cheapest of areas. And it leads me to believe that something else was likely going on (some kind of windfall from somewhere else.) Without knowing the details I can’t say what but I can say that it is very, very unusual for military members to be sitting on hundreds of thousands of dollars and to be able to pay for houses in cash. Which is why I assumed you brought up California (cashing out money from a home sale there.)

As far as pay varying, the basic pay rate does stay the same everywhere but things like BAH (basic allowance for housing) can vary wildly. An e1 in California can easily be getting over 3000 dollars a month in housing pay (almost 4000 in some areas) whereas someone stationed in say, Oklahoma may only be getting 800 dollars a month. If you are putting your BAH towards a mortgage, then you can see how this would help you build value in a home if you later move (like putting money in a saving account). As a side note (that’s also not necessarily applicable here) there are special programs (like through the VA) for military members seeking mortgages with terms like no closing costs, no money down, and very low rates. So people in the military that pursue home ownership potentially have very powerful tools to accomplish that goal. Tools that not everyone has. Many of them don’t use those tools but it’s another reason (amongst many) why members of the military have substantially different circumstances and why it’s hard to compare them to the “regular person” in society.",Ogediah,1,/r/investing/comments/ohip7l/how_did_house_prices_perform_during_the/h4qh9da/,0.054,0.858,0.088,0.9538

11,RE," Yeah but to have an apples to apples comparison you need to use the length of the financing terms. 


Also the average length of owning a single home is 8-10, but ppl who sell will likely buy another home so home ownership is much longer. Because of the transaction costs to selling, the lower duration of owning any individual home actually decreases the value of ownership vs rent + invest. 


You also need a longer period to minimize the distortions from volatility in both RE and financial markets.",y0da1927,1,/r/investing/comments/ohip7l/how_did_house_prices_perform_during_the/h4q65ej/,0.031,0.916,0.053,0.2263

19,CARV," Great question. That's because the return on investment for certain stocks based on momentum is better than it is for value or long term growth.

22,MT," Well, MT is a steel company and their P/E is 13.78.  You have to look at the industry. So, Steel companies are likely all going to trade around the same P/E range. They aren't going to trade at the same P/E as tech companies. One reason is growth. Since you are dealing with a Steel commodity, likely the demand and growth is going to be more consistent over time and provide little growth opportunity.

23,GM," Some industries will have low P/E ratios and it makes sense why they do. For example, Central Pet and Garden ($CENT) has a P/E of 16.5 (ripping it off of QuickFS). I'd call that low relative to today's market. GM has an even lower P/E at 9.50. If a company's growth prospects are low it'll show up in P/E because they won't have many places to put extra cash into. $SBGI is usually like this. It's one of the biggest broadcasters in the U.S and can trade at a P/E of maybe 4x or 5x earnings. Why? Because within P/E are two assumptions that make P/E very sensitive to minute changes: ROIIC and growth. If any one of those changes slightly P/E can tank. If any one of them go up then P/E can skyrocket. You'll have to figure out if ROIIC or growth (or both) have changed for the company. Some companies with low P/Es have no growth prospects or can't reinvest ROIIC into anything better (either because they have few reinvestment options or because they're led by idiots that can't move money around). A low P/E company may deserve a low valuation.

38,JPM," Volkswagen isn't listed on a US exchange. These are unsponsored ADRs which are traded OTC.

Definition of unsponsored ADR - [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsponsoredadr.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsponsoredadr.asp)

I'm unfamiliar with the mechanics but if I had to guess why there are multiple listings - it probably is because there are multiple depository banks that are offering receipts in Volkswagens. From what I can tell both Citi and JPM offer receipts which is why you see at least 2 symbols.

You are seeing VOW because that's the actual ticker that is traded on the Frankfurt exchange.

49,DD," Good post. 

Will add a few things to what you said. There are individual RE stocks and RE ETFs. https://etfdb.com/etfdb-category/real-estate/

* Some are REITs like SCHH or ICF 

* Others are not. VNQ or IYR

Main difference is that REITs are generally geared towards generating income and have higher dividends. So they are good if you are nearing retirement and want consistent income generation. One downside is that their dividends are always taxed as ordinary income rather than capital gains which can be bad for those in high tax states or make a lot of momey. You can get around that by either being a low income earner or buying these in your tax-shelters IRA/Roth/etc.

Within RE ETFs there are very different types from residential (homes, apartment complexes, mortgages), commercial (malls, storage, 5g towers), mixed res/com, and even LoanFinancing+MBS. Make sure you look, DD, and invest carefully.

My personal RE exposure was an early margin investment in MORT, sold puts on OPEN, and bought LEAPs on OPEN. Pretty risky, but I'm very bullish on the economy, entered these positions earlier, and they've been panning out pretty well so far. Would like it if others can share their RE plays too.",zxc123zxc123,1,/r/investing/comments/ohjs59/reit_for_home_ownership_savings/h4pyqxb/,0.031,0.832,0.136,0.9609

54,AAPL," I'm not asking about a ETF that is traded a lot during after hours, I'm talking about an ETF that tracks a lot of things are are traded a lot more on average than other stocks after hours. After hours when the market is closed, that's usually it for the day for my portfolio. I don't get anything else aside from the rare occasional slight changes of a few cents.   


The benefit of that ETF would be that I can ""make some profit while I sleep"". For example, would you rather portfolio A that, after the markets close, rarely changes, and if it does, it goes up/down a few cents, or would you rather portfolio B which would have such an ETF, that, after the markets close, is still doing stuff and making some money? It has nothing to do with the trading itself or the ETF itself, just the stocks that are more traded after hours.   


This is why I said, that if you have stocks like AAPL, MFST, and SPCE, and let's say they're traded on average more after hours (even if they aren't). Then let's have, 100 or so other stocks that are also traded more after hours in that ETF too.

56,AAPL," We are talking about the same type of ETF here: one that trades during regular market hours but is comprised of underlying securities that trade a lot outside of regular hours.

The issue here is that, because the ETF only trades on exchanges during regular hours, you are only making paper profits/losses on the underlying after hours, and these can never be realised because the ETF would not be available to trade during this period. Also, the ETF would not be trading any underlying securities itself during this period and so would not benefit from any after-hours moves. So ultimately, you would not be gaining anything from those after-hours price movements. I expect such an ETF would not provide pricing for itself out of hours (much like existing ETFs that hold AAPL do not) because it would not be a tradable price, so you wouldn’t be able to track those paper profits/losses.

Because the ETF then will not be affected by after-hours pricing of its underlying, that led me to the conclusion above that the ETF would mostly be a proxy for highly liquid securities.


This is why I was curious as to whether you wanted an ETF which traded 24/7, because this would allow you to see the pricing outside of normal market hours and realise those paper profits/losses.",AnInvestmentsDude,8,/r/investing/comments/ohf5et/is_there_such_thing_as_an_after_hours_etf/h4ooysh/,0.029,0.891,0.081,0.8751
