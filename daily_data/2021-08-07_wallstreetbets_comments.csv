57,IMO," I don't like retail buy orders being routed to darkpools even if 99% of the time it benefits retail.

However, the argument for darkpools of block trades only between big players sorta makes sense.  A big player can put literally 1 share up for sale, everyone sees it and now automatically the rest of their shares are assumed ""for sale"" and thus tanking the price.

Same with buying.  Large investors get fucked this way.  Not enough people make this distinction IMO.

Edit: nice pussy downvote with no response left.  All I'm saying is that there is nothing inherently wrong with darkpool transactions among big players as long as ultimately they have to go to the lit exchanges at some point.",actuarythrowaway445,-3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ozg4d7/being_a_retail_investor_in_2021/h81qc7w/,0.106,0.802,0.093,-0.4129

59,GME, But what about cases like GME where these huge hedgefunds complete their options and sales through the darkpools without effecting the market and therefore profiting off of this when instead as they buy the price should rise because demand is rising.

74,DE," So the actual rule making ‚Äúinsider trading‚Äù illegal is rule 10b-5 which prohibits an intentional misrepresentation or omission of material information in connection with the sale or purchase of a security (or a securities based derivative) in violation of a duty. I don‚Äôt really think this is insider trading but the CEO has omitted material information (that he will crater the stock) and he is violating a duty both to his counterparty and to his employer so you have all of the elements of securities fraud. 

Additionally, DE corporate law has a concept of the ‚Äúduty of loyalty‚Äù where corporate execs are required to act in the best interests of the corporation, not themselves. This is a very clear violation of the duty of loyalty so the corporation (or it‚Äôs shareholders via a derivative suit) could sue CEO for the damages he caused (the drop in stock price).

Traders
Special rules apply if you're a trader in securities, in the business of buying and selling securities for your own account. The law considers this to be a business, even though a trader doesn't maintain an inventory and doesn't have customers. To be engaged in business as a trader in securities, you must meet all of the following conditions:

You must seek to profit from daily market movements in the prices of securities and not from dividends, interest, or capital appreciation;
Your activity must be substantial; and
You must carry on the activity with continuity and regularity.
The following facts and circumstances should be considered in determining if your activity is a securities trading business:

Typical holding periods for securities bought and sold;
The frequency and dollar amount of your trades during the year;
The extent to which you pursue the activity to produce income for a livelihood; and
The amount of time you devote to the activity.
If the nature of your trading activities doesn't qualify as a business, you're considered an investor and not a trader. It doesn't matter whether you call yourself a trader or a day trader, you're an investor.

282,YOU," Ok, inasmuch as I feel the need to explain myself to anybody much less some anonymous rando here.  
1. I don't personally conceptualize selling covered calls as lowering my cost basis because that's not how my brain works.  

I conceptualize it as making free money while I allow the stocks to hopefully move in the right direction over a longer time period.  

Right now the market is down/sideways so I'm sitting on everything in my portfolio  I'm not selling at a loss so I might as well put that investment to work by selling covered calls.  No? 

Do you honestly have a problem with this logic as you get so far up your rear end with calculations?  Nevermind, I'm being rhetorical.  
2. I try to choose my strikes logically to get a balance between the premium and risk.   
a. I will never choose a strike below my cost basis so I'll never lose money no matter what.  At worst the strike limits my upside and I get that.  And I'm ok with that.  I know the rule: don't sell calls on a stock you don't want to lose.  I'm a dilettante/dabbler in all of this.  If I exit with a few thousand profit, I'm ok with that.  I won't cry if I would have made a little bit more.  
b.  I know it's not perfect but I take the delta as the rough probability of being assigned following the guideline of 0.30 or below.  From memory this Wish call was 0.25 but don't swear me to that.  It wasn't higher than 0.30 because that's my cutoff.  

So that's a 25-30% chance of assignment on a stock that YOU think is a long term hold.  I'll take that bet (this is a casino, sir): $450 with a 70-75% chance of expiring worthless.  Those are better than Vegas odds.   
At 15 strike would have been completely safe but the premium would be shite. This is a casino and I'll take my chances.  I'm a big boy and accept responsibility for my actions.  
3. Even if it looks like it's moving, I know how to buy to close.  Even if the premium to do so is higher than what I got, I can also do basic math.    
So let's say I have to pay $1000 to close the call.  I'm down $550.  But if the stock hit say 13, I could sell for 1500 \* +2 over cost basis = 3000 = 2450 net.  Sure, I'd have made $3000 without the call.  
If it were going to 14 and YOU KNOW it's not doing that by Sep 17th, I could sell at  
1500 \* +3 = 4500 - 550 = 3950.  I'd have made 4500 without the call.  
The math works out the same no matter what: whatever value it hits that I could sell it for over strike, I make only $450 less due to the call.  
But since it's almost assuredly (well 70-75% chance) going to expire worthless, refer yourself to 1.  

Even you think this is long-term, why are you busting my nuts over this?  You know full well it's not getting assigned in the next 27 or so days.  
   
So far as I'm concerned, I made $450 for doing nothing with what I consider a very calculated risk. This is a casino after all.

It is absolutely not true that everyone got it for $1 per pill.  People with commercial insurance did not get subsidized and patients with 50% copay had $16k copay bill.  People on Medicare had cost share based on a percentage.

But some stocks that have been selling off suddenly have a change in fortune. CLOV needs to get a lot cheaper before I'd look at buying in tho. But it would also need a major catalyst to change everyone's low opinion of the stock.

As soon as the pandemic hit, they furloughed a lot of their departments and straight up told everyone it was to survive through 2022...

They've already started hiring some of those furloughed employees back as well. They're slowly bringing ppl back.

A few years ago, they got rid of most of their leased theaters as well. Minus mall locations, they own most of the land their theaters are on.

So it comes to $100 for a family of 4. On the other hand, you can watch it at home for $15 on any steaming service. I am trying to understand AMC or Cinemark business model here. 

Most of the spending now could be driven by temporary helicopter free money sprayed on poors by the govt. I want to see what it looks like in July.

366,DVD," The entire back end economics of the film industry are going through drastic changes, and theatres are becoming far less important in the structure. So many people (studios, licensees, above the line talent, producers etc.) are now getting paid upfronts instead of a piece of the back end. That means a 200m budget movie now costs 300m+.

Watch the outcome of the ScarJo lawsuit. Or the structure of the recent South Park deal. Right now, movie theatres are the battleground of the whole industry, and the entire industry is not favoring them whatsoever. In fact, they‚Äôre increasingly restructuring so that cinemas are synonymous with DVD sales.

Theatres aren‚Äôt going anywhere soon, but don‚Äôt expect big money back or anything long term. It‚Äôs like investing in Blockbuster in 2008.",madavison,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ozyj0s/cnk_huge_opportunity_in_cinemark/h838iiq/,0.037,0.877,0.087,0.8311
