I have a checking and savings account, a 401K, and Roth IRA (that I started and manage myself), and my Robinhood account. Think of all five of these account as ""baskets"" in which to keep your money. Keep your checking up to snuff and keep a monthly budget. Hold at least 6 months living expenses in your savings for emergency situations. Try to top out your Roth IRA at 6k per year. Let your Robinhood account help feed these other accounts.

This was a long-winded way of saying, if you need to fill a basket, withdraw some funds from Robinhood and feed it. Don't fall into the ""Well, let me just get RH up to XXXX and then I'll withdraw some. Well, let me YOLO this, make a quick buck, and then I'll withdraw the profits, etc etc"" In the trading and swinging game, you very well could take a big hit in the next week, month, year, and then you'll wish you had.

98,AEZS," Do any of you guys sell covered calls regularly? I've lucked into a bit of a good situation with AEZS.

I own 10k shares of AEZS at $1.29. My current calls for $2 and $3 expire on the 19th of this month. I'll be able to sell 100 contracts at a $1.5 strike price and collect a premium of $2000. If the stock is close to 1.5, I'll play it safe and sell it at a $2 strike for $1500. Then I repeat again next month.

If the stock ends up going above 1.5 or 2, I will still make a decent profit since the average is only $1.29.

As long I keep it under $1.50, it's all golden and if it goes above, then I exit with a great profit + the premiums I've collected until then.

I was wondering if anyone has any stocks they regularly selled covered calls on.

208,DD," I take everything from a DD post with a grain of salt. The person writing the DD is *most likely* selling you something. They probably already hold a position. Research what they say in their post. Don't just look for confirmation bias.

I check unbiastock.com to see what reddit and Twitter are talking about. From those tickers I check each on yahoo finance, open insider, trading view, fintel, and seeking alpha. Stay the fuck away from stock twits, it's just a bunch of shills.

I'm still learning technical analysis so my foundation is in company fundamentals and catalysts. Do I understand what the company does and where they fit in their industry? Are their products innovative or reliable and are there any moats? Will this be a long position or swing trade? Are insiders buying? Are institutions buying and if so, which ones? Any recent news about the company, either positive or negative?

For me volume is king. All your research could say one thing but volume could say another. How does the balance sheet look? A lot of pennies are clinical stage biopharma, so do they have cash and what is their burn rate like? Look at earnings QoQ and YoY and notice trends.

I think the most important thing is forming your own opinion and taking the time to do your own research.

220,TRCH," Not sure, probably neutral. The META shareholders can exchange for TRCH -or- Canco stock. So probably they are giving time to let shareholders figure out which one they want. Also of note is that after the exchange they will undergo reverse stock split, which will make the price go up and this may mean that META shareholders could opt to sell at the top. It's a big ball of wax and I'm not quite sure what it all means. No positions cuz no free capital.

Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRCH), an oil and gas exploration company (""Torchlight"") and Metamaterial Inc. (""META"") (CSE:MMAT), a developer of high-performance functional materials and nanocomposite products, announced today the execution of a non-binding letter of intent (""LOI"", signed on September 15, 2020), for Torchlight to acquire 100% of META and to divest within the first half of 2021 Torchlight's oil and gas assets for the benefit of Torchlight's legacy shareholders (the ""Proposed Transaction""). Upon completion of the Proposed Transaction, shareholders of META are expected to hold a 75% interest in the combined entity.

Legacy shareholders is why I believe the special dividend is TRCH only, but if that is TRCH before or after the split I am unsure. In any case, you are also correct that TRCH shares will be issued for MMAT (the new ticker) at 1:4 ratio in respect to the current META shareholders.",Cardinalsfan5545,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m0t18i/metamaterials_and_torchlight_extends_deadline_for/gqcmmnv/,0.014,0.877,0.108,0.91
