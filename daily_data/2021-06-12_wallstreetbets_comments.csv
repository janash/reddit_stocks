37,TD," See if you're eligible for a ROTH IRA (or possibly a ROTH 401K). I know, you're probably young and all retirement accounts sound boomer boring, and they probably are, but, hear me out ...

You may know that contributions made to a traditional IRA are tax deductible and NOT tax deductible for ROTH IRAs. However... The beauty of ROTH IRAs is that nothing you hold, buy or sell inside a ROTH is taxable. So you can trade your way to a fortune and not pay tax on it.  And, when you're finally old enough to start getting regular disbursements from your ROTH IRA, the money doesn't normally count as income for tax purposes then either, unlike with a traditional IRA. Win!  
One other potentially helpful thing about a ROTH IRA... It is possible, in certain situations, to take out some/all of your profits without being hit with penalties, unlike with a traditional IRA.

Fidelity, TD Ameritrade and other big names offer 'self directed' ROTH accounts but not all companies do. You need 'self directed' because then you can do your own investing - trading - if you want. I have accounts with both of those companies and was approved for option trading within my ROTH IRA as well (once I adjusted my account profile to show I was OK with high risks).

Just an idea for you to think about. Of course you should do your own research before doing anything at all. :)",WellWishez,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny9pav/can_someone_spot_where_i_found_out_about/h1jiei9/,0.006,0.846,0.148,0.9894

It doesn't matter if groups of people have their goals and ideas , just leave them alone, they can do what they want with their own money and time.... its just a waiting game.
Personally I'm still in profit in AMC so I'll hold for the sole purpose of seeing what it does and the intent on selling when I'm in the red , so I'm pleased people are shouting to hold, it suits me, but that doesn't mean I'm getting irate over people that claim its wise to sell. 

Who gives a shit what groups of people say and do with their money and posts. If someone is so stupid as to go against their urge to sell because a small group on redit tells them not to with silly ape emojis and child-like speeches,  then they REALLY shouldn't be in the markets and this will turn out to be a lesson in life, so either way there is value lol.",Think_Machine_7442,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxte5i/the_most_important_thing_i_have_learned_is_not/h1hsyse/,0.11,0.806,0.084,-0.7549

99,DD," In the beginning was the Meme and it was Gamestop (wasn't it?)

Redditors banded together to skyrocket the value of GameStop stock at the expense of hedge funds who had bet on it falling.

That last bit of the sentence is the important bit.

It was in fact **the HF who bet on it falling** and it was in fact **the HF who skyrocketed the price** because they HAD TO buy from freakz who would not sell.. Hence ""diamond hands"". There was **a point to holding** in that situation. It was pretty well documented, IMO.

But diamond hands is only a good thing if someone is desperately bidding for those shares. Just holding them when no one particularly wants them won't do anyone any special good - the only people who want to buy are other meme-freaks who have got hold of the wrong end of the stick. No one is interested in the shares except the meme freaks. They are interested because ""it's a meme"". They bid against each other and when one of them wins the others lose. The hedge funds probably laugh about that. Why should they care unless they were caught with their dick trapped in the door?

So - that definitely is not an attack on the roots of privileged and insider trading, there is no special situation, and it **is NOT** the retailers getting rich off the booty of the Hedge Funds. Unless there is ATM a sound DD reason for it, don't go there. Without that concrete base a ""meme frenzy"" is just a mob excitement where some retailers win and a lot of retailers don't win.

Bottom line - It's the **meme-freak fantasy** under the sheets dream : **For 100 dollars you buy an electric guitar and then you become the guitar hero of the generation** \- **right?**

.. ? ..

You dont have to understand what the fucks going on, you just have to shout the same shout as everyone else and throw in your money. Except by the time you hear where to throw, you probably too late & already lost. Smarter or faster folk got there first. You push the price up, they sell for a profit.

So forget the diamond hands and the hodl - NO stock is special, and nothing is going to the moon. Only get involved in a meme if you have solid DD on the situation and YOU TRUST IT, because for a while now there is a lot of crap being talked in all directions. TRUST your sources and understand WHY you trust them or dont get involved.

Except by the time you hear where to throw, you probably too late & already lost. Smarter or faster folk got there first. You push the price up, they sell for a profit.

So forget the diamond hands and the hodl - NO stock is special, and nothing is going to the moon. Only get involved in a meme if you have solid DD on the situation and YOU TRUST IT, because for a while now there is a lot of crap being talked in all directions. TRUST your sources and understand WHY you trust them or dont get involved.

You can't give a sucker an even break.

183,AMC," Idk what the issue is. Should all high level investors be silent when they make an investment, or is it al just manipulation. Nobody ever seems to care when a hedge fund announces they are long a position, but when it is short (in this case via short calls), many cry about market manipulation. That might be what happened, but there are plenty of reasons to go short AMC (not that it‚Äôs wise to bet against a meme stock in the short term), and I don‚Äôt think announcing they think the stock is overvalued is gross manipulation. A conflict of interest, maybe, but they‚Äôre a fund not a news paper, so what would you expect? That‚Äôs literally what a fund is supposed to do. 

Shorting or any functional equivalent isn‚Äôt scum. It‚Äôs an important set of mechanics in a well functioning financial market. A fund providing its rationale for utilizing these mechanics on a particular security is a useful resource to be considered by other investors (to challenge/support their thesis on said security). I‚Äôll defend that any day.",insightful_pancake,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxsxy4/after_weeks_of_profiting_from_the_stock_and_debt/h1jgnll/,0.101,0.785,0.114,0.5267

253,GME," Because when you naked short a stock at 3 dollars, for 4 years, you can't cover, and they never planned on covering.This is not uncommon with naked shorted stocks, as the strategy was to bankrupt Gamestop and take all the cash from the shorting as tax free cash. 

And because GME would have gone bankrupt, there would have been no naked shorts to cover.

There is still a ticking time bomb hidden on GME, be it the FTDs, the deep OTM puts, like on July 16th having 405,173 OTM puts, which is 40,517,300 theoretical shares.",Skid_and_Pump,22,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxtvgy/melvin_capital_again_reports_losses_also_mudrick/h1icmk6/,0.12,0.803,0.076,-0.6808
254,GME," Let‚Äôs say you shorted a half billion dollars worth of GME at an average of 4$ a share over months. GME is now 200 (rounding down to keep it simple). If Melvin capital wanted to close their position today, they would have to pay 25 BILLION dollars to do so at the current price. They don‚Äôt have that kind of cash (remember they got a 3 billion dollar lifeline in January from shitadel? That was likely to stave off a margin call which would have had a domino effect on the entire market since it would have rocketed GME to the thousands thereby also fucking other big players who shorted GME). So what choice does Melvin capital have? They just keep kicking the can down the road by paying the borrowing fee for the shares (currently 1% which I think is bullshit and is being manipulated by the lenders to help their buddies out). As GME continues to slowly rise in price, eventually (days? Months? Years?) the borrowing fee will be too much for them to handle and they will have to close out their position. 

The awesome part is that it is costing us exactly 0 dollars to break these guys. They are paying millions in borrowing fees (which is now a survival fee basically) each day while all we are doing is holding and buying the dips. 

They‚Äôre fucked, they know it, it‚Äôs just a matter of when at this point.

Side note: I truly believe GameStop can trigger the MOASS at any point (crypto dividend would force the shorts to cover just like what happened to overstock). Extra Tinfoil hat time: either GameStop is waiting for a green light from the government to wreck these guys or they just need more time to enable the infrastructure to support a crypto dividend. 

Side-side note: GameStop hired 2 Amazon execs to lead their company. Why the fuck would these guys leave AMAZON (their stock is 3300 a share and a lot of their compensation comes from stock options) and come to GameStop? I think they know their shares will eventually be worth 10-10000 their current worth.",Pepticulcer,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxtvgy/melvin_capital_again_reports_losses_also_mudrick/h1ix3og/,0.053,0.852,0.095,0.8955

It's always a possibility, which is why no one should put in more than they can afford to lose.

If the US government did allow that to happen though, I can't see it being good for the health of the US markets.

301,APP," This is great data and analysis.

I pointed this out on another thread but the main problem with investing in the IPOs at the offer price is that there is adverse selection.  The hotter the IPO, the harder it is to get allocated shares.  And of course, those are the ones that are likely to pop the most.

So if you simply request, say, $10k worth of shares in every single IPO, you will find that your results are far worse than the results here.  You might even lose money, depending on how good of a customer to your broker you are (better customers are more likely to get allocated the shares they request, which make the adverse selection not as bad)

On the plus side, my shares of APP are finally trading above their $80 offer price.",Keith_13,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny6wpp/i_analyzed_3600_ipos_over_the_past_two_decades_to/h1j7x60/,0.11,0.767,0.123,0.0516

All of this within 30 minutes of it going live.  Months after that it got crushed down to 2.   Afterwards, I analyzed all of the IPOs of the period, if I had shorted all of them 1 week after going live, I would have made a fortune.   I see the same with SPAQs this past year.

303,DIBS," Great analysis. I appreciate the time and commitment this took to research and write. 

I‚Äôve been investing in IPO‚Äôs for some time now. Like you stated, the real money is getting in pre Launch before retail. What I‚Äôve found is basically it‚Äôs impossible if you‚Äôre a retail investor trying to get shares before it‚Äôs offered publicly. 

There‚Äôs many websites you can join that will give you access to initial offerings before the company goes public. The catch is you have to invest $250k plus from what I‚Äôve seen. $20k-$50k isn‚Äôt even considered. 

Even know retail is getting the short end of the stick there‚Äôs still money to be made. Let‚Äôs use DIBS as an example. DIBS opened at $20 and closed at $28 last Thursday.  Great increase if you day traded it. There‚Äôs many IPOs that do this. The trick is determining which ones are going to be the winners. 

Here‚Äôs what I do. 

I go to nasdaq.com I navigate the to IPO Calendar. I then research all the companies that are going public for the month. I then look at their financials, ceo, website, and the company as a whole. What are they, what do they provide. I pick a few out I really like and make a list. I then compare that list with companies that are similar and currently trading. 

After all that I wait for opening day and I buy shares as soon as it‚Äôs listed. I buy, wait, and usually sell the same day. 

If you do the research more than often this strategy works.",fadetoblack123,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny6wpp/i_analyzed_3600_ipos_over_the_past_two_decades_to/h1jr0ij/,0.005,0.879,0.117,0.981

For only $1000 I can average down nearly $1. Which is nuts considering I have like 6k in it. Ironically had I just woken up from my nap 10 mins later id have a $12 price point, but that‚Äôs how stocks are‚Ä¶just is what it is.

I know long term I‚Äôll make my money back and it‚Äôs a peaceful feeling after having a pretty painful loss/profit mistake. Couldn‚Äôt fall asleep one night when CLOV was going off. DIDNT set stop loss at $28.25 which was my goal. I was wide awake so I didn‚Äôt bother. All of a sudden I woke up and it was at like $20. Anyways I got killed, it hurt pretty bad because I had finally recovered money lost from a crash in many stocks in a month and a couple weeks ago. I lost like 1500 right off the bat.

471,ASO," I bought some longish term calls on ASO expecting a run up before the March earnings report. I was down for a while but decided to double down the day before earnings because I was expecting them to have a beat on earnings. Some of the calls I bought were some FD $40 calls expiring in two weeks for $2.5k when the stock was around $24. Day of earnings they absolutely outperformed the expected EPS and the stock was up almost 10% but my calls were worth about half of what I paid for them ($1.5k) due to IV crush. I decided that IV had to go up eventually and I was basically getting a fat discount so I went all in and bought $15k worth of the same calls. Over the next several days the stock continued climbing up to about $33 and eventually IV went back up and I basically 10x my position and cashed out.

637,WISH," Their current market cap is their valuation. Current valuation is 6.2B with much more room to the downside. Firstly no one trades at 4/5x expected revenue go look at grub/uber/lyft/dash(though is is skewed from their IPO) and come back with a accurate number. Secondly, their revenue numbers in the logistics space are false. They recognize gross and not net. So you can remove 85% of the logistics revenue as what they actually bank as that money has to be paid to the logistics providers. 

Let‚Äôs say you take an Uber for 20 bucks. Uber‚Äôs margins are 20% so you pay uber 20 bucks, they pay 16 dollars to the driver and 4 dollars uber collects and recognized as revenue. 
In the above example WISH, in their logistics space, is recognizing the entire 20 dollars that was paid to them as revenue. Though still has to pay out 16 dollars. It‚Äôs pretty shady accounting.

If uber booked gross rev like WISH does uber would had have $65B dollars in rev for just 2019. For a company whose market cap is currently 50B. Just to show you how misleading this gross rev number from Wish is in their logistics space.

 Below is from their latest 10-q:

NOTE 2. DISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE
The Company generates revenue from marketplace and logistics services provided to merchants. Revenue is recognized as the Company transfers control of promised goods or services to its users in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company considers both the merchant and the user to be customers. The Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue on a gross or net basis based upon its evaluation of whether the Company obtains control of the specified goods or services by considering if it is primarily responsible for fulfillment of the promise, has inventory risk, has latitude in establishing pricing and selecting suppliers, among other factors. **Based on these factors, marketplace revenue is generally recognized on a net basis and logistics revenue is generally recognized on a gross basis.** Revenue excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including indirect taxes.",Caveat_Venditor_,-1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny69ns/why_you_should_make_a_wish/h1j3ywg/,0.075,0.849,0.076,0.0595

Inflation in a broad based, and sustained increase in prices and wages across ALL categories. Steel is up 300% from the bottom pits of the COVID lockdowns, and still well cheaper than it was in 2018. What has been going on, is oil prices have gone way up, because production/supply got jacked up in covid. Massive and complex supply chains shut down, and take a long time to restart. A very complex issue with chips, that is causing a global supply shortage. A complex problem with lumber that caused skyrocketing prices. A frenzy of shifted demand for good over services, cause everyone was stuck at home, that also compounded a massive shipping contained and worker shortage.

Literally everything that is causing ""inflation"" are just things that will work out, as production scales back up, people get back to working, services start to compete for dollars, stimulus checks end, and so on.

961,UPS, well my you have to create the infrastructure check out you local truck stops it‚Äôs 10 pumps for diesel and maybe on CNG spot until there is enough demand truck stops won‚Äôt change. as a driver i can get 1600 miles per fuel up. o can refuel in about 20 minutes. for owners operators they are gonna go with cheapest they can go with company fleets are also willing to invest for cheaper alternatives but the issues is both fuel and service to the trucks. as a company you will have to open your own pumps at your facility and know where the next one is an app can take care of that. also CNG has been around for a while but hasn‚Äôt even come close to replacing diesel. the cng does not get the same mileage as the diesel so the driver have to fule up more often. also the cold effects how much fuel can fit in the tanks. even though company‚Äôs have signed on to this it only for credit. The companies will do a big press release of how they are going green they will get a couple discounted trucks and they will find so small route that they can do to make it look good and 5 years later it‚Äôs all over. i can see how some companies like UPS and Fedex can do this that already have the trucks and they don‚Äôt care where the fuel comes from but man if you can sell green delivery to the public that makes them wet their panties then good deal as for cross country driving you got to have the infrastructure to support the fleets,DavidLow1836,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nyc8gd/clne_inked_contracts/h1jjn2r/,0.013,0.871,0.116,0.9853
962,CLNE," I like your input and I agree with you that they will not be able to support the whole industry.  I also agree with you that more infrastructure will need to be built and they are in the process of attacking that issue.

However no empire was ever built overnight, it is a process.  The trucking industry is huge and I think we can all admit the amount of emissions produced from running a nationwide fleet of diesel motors needs to be reduced.  Visit almost any major populated city or area in the U.S. and you can visibly see the air pollution.

With the U.S. now back in the Paris Climate agreement their is a push to reduce these emissions.  CLNE has the product available now to make an impact now.

I think we could also admit that Electric semis are no where near close to being an option for either short or long haul trucking.",Jmonahan581,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nyc8gd/clne_inked_contracts/h1jmuma/,0.045,0.837,0.118,0.872

989,DD," If you're looking for more DD, there is A LOT out there from some of us have been following for a while, especially over in r/senseonics.

I'll try to summarize. There is a lot of growth potential here, even without any meme attention or a pump. SENS recently released data that shows strong accuracy for their 180 day implantable continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. This data comes from a thorough study that took about 2 years to complete. From reading responses from diabetics, SENS products are arguably better than Dexcom, which has a much larger valuation from it's growth over the years.

FDA approval is coming soon. No one knows when, but it's very likely it will be this quarter, so anywhere from a few days, weeks, or months. Retail investors will probably be the last to find out about it though, like always.

I think OP's ""$100 stonk"" won't happen anytime in the near-term, but it's an opportunity for massive gains for both short-term and long-term holders.

In addition to the study, SENS has partnered with Ascensia who will be helping them roll out a nice marketing push.

There's also a theory that following the initial rally a few months ago, the MMs brought the price down so they can load up for cheap before it takes off.

Below are some of the results of the study. The translation is that their product works.

* Overall mean absolute relative difference (MARD) against reference value was 9.1% for the primary sensor over 49,000 paired points and 8.5% for the SBA sensor over 12,000 paired points.
* The percent sensor readings within 20 mg/dL or 20% of reference values (20/20% agreement rate) were as follows:
* Across the full 40-400 mg/dL range, the agreement rate was 92.9% for the primary sensor and 93.9% for the SBA sensor.
* In the hypoglycemic ranges of 40-60 mg/dL and 61-80 mg/dL, the agreement rates were 89.4% and 92.2% for the primary sensor and 96.5% and 96.8% for the SBA sensor, respectively.
* Confirmed hypoglycemic alert detection rate was 93% for primary sensor and 94% for the SBA sensor.
* There were no related serious adverse events, all sensors were removed during the initial removal procedure and 1.1% of patients had a mild infection at the procedure site.

998,BIG," PLEASE READ, IM SICK OF SEEING THESE BOGUS NUMBERS.

These numbers are wrong. I‚Äôm a type 1 diabetic and I keep seeing this mistake with regard to sens. There is a BIG difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetics. Type 2 diabetics make up ~95% of all diabetics. When you see that 13% of Americans are diabetic this overwhelmingly refers to type 2. Something like 1/8 Americans have type 2, and 1/400 have type 1. CGMs are specifically useful to type 1 diabetics, but they‚Äôre barely in use by type 2 diabetics. Between 10-25% of TYPE 1 diabetics use cgms, NOT diabetics as a whole. There are only about 1-2 million type 1 diabetics in the US total, so you do the math. This poster claims that 10% of diabetics = 5 million diabetics are using CGMs, but that‚Äôs more than double the total number of type 1 diabetics in the entire country.

Unless CGMs get a lot cheaper and easier, they‚Äôre all but out of the question for most type 2 diabetics, and medically it‚Äôs nowhere near as useful to type 2 diabetics. This is a much more niche product than you‚Äôre being led to believe. Even if we forget about the distinction between type 1 and 2, there are other problems with sens that I won‚Äôt go into detail about this second, but this is being sold as a game changing revolutionary product with mass market appeal, and it‚Äôs simply not the case. It may be a useful medical device for type 1 diabetics, it may continue to improve and it might even sell well and marginally improve some type 1 diabetics‚Äô treatment regime, but most of the DD that I‚Äôve seen on this is based off of some very skewed data.",FETUS_LAUNCHER,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny5dgb/sens_conservative_dd_for_100_stonk_and_beyond/h1jg4ya/,0.046,0.856,0.098,0.9456

1091,SENS," Right, Tandem+Dexcom is current best combination. MDT is probably second and Libre is the last . I don't know if they combine it with any pump manufacturer.   
But here is the thing. Saying politely, I am not convinced that DXCM limiting sensor to 10 days is only care about diabetics . That's how they make money. Libre is targeting Type 2 people in long-term care so nurse can walk by , do a scan and make a record in the log. So ABT (Libre manufacture) makes money from Medicare . And MDT with its fake 'artificial pancreas'  makes money on selling combination pump+CGM and supplies to both.

1180,DD," Nobody cares because it‚Äôs misleading at best. $CLF is a mining company eroding the soil of the Great Lakes region because well, that‚Äôs what mining companies do. But we need them keep mining so they can help the mills turn raw steel coil into products that we use everyday day. 

The problem is that right now they don‚Äôt want to give coil to the mills and in turn the mills don‚Äôt want to turn on the furnaces to produce steel. In the end we have an over demand for steel products and very little supply. Guess what happens to the price of the product? You got it, it goes up. So they are able to manipulate the supply chain, with tons of government support and way less overhead than what they had when the pandemic started. 

The result? Poor revenue but amazing earnings which is what investors want to see. Insiders know it and buy more company stock. Analysts know it and recommend as a ‚Äúbuy‚Äù. Then the herd follows suit and we get a perfect storm of inflated stock prices when the reality is there is no steel and steel products being produced. The very little being produced is getting sold at 3x last year prices.

If you need more proof just look at (USS) $X and (Nucor) $NUE. All domestic steel stocks follow the exact same pattern - except for JSW because they haven‚Äôt been given raw steel since 2018 and just filed a lawsuit.

By the way, natural gas burning produces a ton of emissions but it *can* be 50% less CO2 than usual. If $CLF was so smart and green they would actually recover the vapor from burning their gas and sell it to the City of Toledo.

My point is this is all a marketing plot folks. $CLF is doing just fine as a company and will ride this manipulated market as long as it can, then sell the stock real high to have enough cash to go back to normal operational levels. Be smart and do you DD so you don‚Äôt hold all the bags.

BTW, gotta love how tree huggers love the initiatives to natural gas but condemn producers and the whole oil and gas industry. People need to become more educated about how their lights turn on when they flick the switch.",foreverwealthy84,-3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny0h5y/clf_lots_of_room_to_rocket_w_natural_gas/h1ij95w/,0.054,0.794,0.152,0.9928

- tells the truth about China

- does not spend investor airtime on woke dogma

1278,IMO," Because the call option itself has value and can be sold when it increases in premium as the stock price increases. The inverse is also true, when you buy a call option and the stock price lowers the value of the call also lowers. So if you buy a call for $1 and your stock price goes up a certain amount you can then sell the call for $2. There are more important things to know such as Implied volatility and Theta specifically when choosing call options. You should google how they work, watch a youtube beginner video or something and then try your hand at one this week on a meme stock. Just get a cheap OTM call, watch the stock price, and watch the change in value of the call based on the price movement and you'll figure it out pretty quick.

1312,GDP," Well i have a far less nuanced way to figure out when it's coming.  This applied to the dotcom bust and the great recession.  When your idiot friend or neighbor is talking to you about how so and so tech company is the next big thing or that if you put money into real estate you'll double or triple it within months if not weeks the crash is right around the corner.  Hell i was 18 years old when the dotcom bubble burst and everyone knew that was coming, then lived in Naples Florida in the mid to late 2000s and would drive up I75 every day going to work and see the same billboards advertising housing developments that the only thing that ever changed was the price kept going up.  Meanwhile ive got friends who are working barely minimum wage jobs and are now buying those homes.  Didn't take a genius to figure it out that was unsustainable.

My best guessestimate of what brings this one on.  Stagflation.  Inflation doesn't turn out so transitory.  And the narrative that this is going to be like the roaring 20's because hey they had a virus and got through that is missing the key component of you know having a bunch of the world's countries lose like 10% of their male population in a war then factor in a pandemic on top of that the people who were still around had a much better labor market to return to.  I mean what's the real true figure on how many businesses were lost during COVID and how what is the real unemployment number.  I think the assumption that we are going to be roaring again is based on the false idea that those numbers are reliable.  I can drive down the main street in my little podunk town and see a couple of dozen businesses that closed and nothing has replaced them.  I'm seeing signs everywhere and all i think it will take is just one shitty GDP report to set the entire house of cards on fire.",sinncab6,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/h1jhliq/,0.082,0.83,0.088,0.015

1314,GDP, Yeah but they can hide all that under GDP growth that wont be the catalyst.  Market might go sideways for a little bit but it wont correct as long as we keep meeting or exceeding GDP growth.  My thoughts are that once that number fails to meet expectations we will see a sell off into correction territory which will then lead stagflation and a steady decline downward.  I think the stagflation part will come because the economies of China and India will grow after this and continue growing thusly propping up commodity prices and keeping inflation up despite the US going into a downturn.,sinncab6,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/h1jmn1g/,0.052,0.839,0.109,0.631

I guess that could be a sign of what‚Äôs the come. As Warren Buffet says, ‚ÄúBe fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful.‚Äù

Another age old sign of an impending market crash is euphoria. Leading up to the Great Depression, literally everyone was getting interested in the stock market. People were taking out loans to invest in the market. That is basically what is happening now.

1410,ASO," The short thesis is dumb as fuck but I'll do my best..  

The business wasn't that strong prior to the pandemic and it has pretty bad financials when compared to peers.  I'll come back to this. 

KKR is the money-grubbingest PE firm there is, and there was a lot of thought that they just decided to sell their ownership in the company at just the right moment, before the two best quarters the company had ever had, or would ever have.  The pandemic led to all-time high buying in weight lifting systems, treadmills, canoes, trampolines, basketball systems, guns and ammo, etc.  I.e. the highest margin items that a sporting goods store can sell.  So the results were going to be record breaking...that was sorta obvious back in the summer of 2020.  When the pandemic was over, the assumption was those sales would disappear.

The IPO was pretty disappointing.  They were expecting it to sell around 16-18 but ended up only selling at 12-13.  It also was a pretty long hold by KKR, they bought in like 2011 iirc and didn't sell til 2020, which is a long time in private equity.  Which suggested it didn't go as well as planned.

So anyway, the price was rising after December and many thought it would fall back down...then at some point in January the price spiked to 27...look at the chart on January 27-28.  Two things happened...there were probably some shorts that needed to liquidate so they covered, and there was a spike.  KKR then announced that they'd be selling shares on the spike (non-dilutive obviously), and the stock got shorted down to 20 the next day.

The first time ASO showed up on the short list was in mid-feb, reflective of January 31 figures.

Anyway, the short thesis is still that the stock is too high because they're idiots.  Despite reducing debt from $1b to $300MM and improving margins, the shorts apparently still believe that Academy will return to the humdrum operating results pre-pandemic.  And despite the improvements, other firms have improved more rapidly.  All their peers have a better current ratio, leverage ratio, ROA, etc.  Big Five was a huge piece of shit pre-pandemic and they used this time to erase their debt entirely.  Dick's is absolutely on fire.  Academy is still lagging in the financials.

Anyway, there's not that much short interest anyway.  The institutional ownership is overexaggerated everywhere because the numbers are stale, which means the float is larger than reported, and ASO (along with corroboration from big five) has proven the success is continuing, so the shorts have likely been covering.

I'll just add from my perspective, I haven't seen the stock act anywhere near as annoying as it did from Feb to April, when I lost money on calls because somebody kept knocking it back down, and volume was too low to push through.  It's moving forward pretty steadily since then.

The market sure seems to think that there is serious upward momentum ahead - $45 as an option tier for July 16th.

It doesn‚Äôt look good after these last two days - but next week will be very interesting. 

The stock went from closing at low $8s to closing at $10 in one week. And went up almost $7 in one day this week. 

More importantly, it broke out of the bearish channel with a bullish reversal. Momentum, volume and sentiment has never been higher. 

CLOV went from $9 to $28 in two days - that looks far more like a pump and dump in comparison. Short borrowing fees are rising and this is a dangerous area to be a bear.
