They tend to not follow their own patient nurse ratios which are extremely lax to begin with. I think 12 patients to one nurse unless its ICU. Insanity.

I wouldn't touch this until they raise enough capital to complete a pilot plant.  Might mean missing out, but FOMO is dangerous when a company doesn't have a healthy balance sheet to weather a storm.

136,NOW," Summary of the first conference I've found regarding the CEO's remarks:

1. he said this twice, paraphrase "" MiQlab is commercially available"" - meaning it's real, they're selling them NOW
2. reaffirms 1st sale into Open-Access market (HUGE deal)
3. No competition on the Open-Access market NONE
4. EUA seems to cover the ability of MiQlab to rapidly configure to detect covid variants
5. 2 patents issued, 5 more pending
6. multiplex & 98.2% concurrence with references
7. 2 consumables, 1st is one time use, 2nd is assay cartridge used ~25 times
8. FDA is requiring more food testing through Food Safety Act
9. 40 employees now

The second conference (Benzinga) involved mainly companies from the Nasdaq/NYSE.  Mentioned a re-order from a large biopharma company that I don't believe has been identified yet.",FrankThomas1B,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/mfaybi/lexagene_lxxgf/gsoh4ej/,0.017,0.943,0.04,0.4404
