I have modified it to analyze financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss, etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

28,USA," well then here you go!  

**DD**

**Core Product**

High Tide is Canada’s largest cannabis retailer. The company was founded in 2018 when Canada legalized cannabis. They are a pure-play retailer which allows them to bypass the Ontario govt’s limit on vertical integration.

They are one of the two front-runners in the Canadian cannabis retail industry. The company just completed Its merger with Meta Growth, to become the largest cannabis retailer in Canada. They also own Grasscity which is an Amsterdam-based global e-commerce site for smoking and cannabis consumption accessories.

**Financials**

High Tide currently has a market cap of around $400MM. Their revenue increased by 166% to $83M and gross profit increased by 112% to $8.7M for the year ended on Oct’20. This is not including any contribution from their merger with Meta Growth. The company overall is still in a loss as expected for a high growth startup with a net loss of $5M for the year ended on Oct’20 (compared to $21M loss in 2019).

Their revenue stream as expected is heavily biased towards Canada (82%), with the US contributing 18% and the rest of 1% coming from international markets. Over 50% of the retail revenue for the company came from their Cabana Club members (High Tide’s membership/loyalty program)

The company has a strong cash position of $38M as of Mar’21 which will give them a long runway to execute its growth plans. Their expected revenue for Q1’21 is $37-38M.

**Potential and Hype Factors**

**Store Expansion:** The company is investing heavily into store expansion and expects to have more than 115 stores by the end of 2021 which should significantly drive revenue growth and margin expansion.

**Increasing Cannabis Consumption:** Canada has witnessed an explosive growth in retail sales of adult recreation cannabis. The retail sales increased from $125M in October 2019 to $270M today, \~110% increase YoY.

**Nasdaq Listing:** The company has submitted its application to list on the Nasdaq stock market which would significantly add to the liquidity of the stock and also enable trading the stock in major platforms.

**Further deregulation/legalization in USA:** Any further deregulation or legalization of cannabis in USA would be extremely beneficial to High Tide as they are the largest player in Canada and can effectively leverage their existing position.

**Risk and Competition**

Currently, the biggest risk to High Tide is the barrier to entry within different Canadian provinces. Each Canadian province has a different system for cannabis distribution. For example, the largest market Ontario is currently issuing 30 new licenses per week with no upper limit. There is a possibility that the markets can become overcrowded and the existing margins can erode.

Another risk factor to consider is capital expenditure. High Tide needs to acquire prime real estate for their stores and the company would require continued access to capital to execute their ambitious store expansion strategy. Their competitor Fire & Flower has also announced a significant expansion in the Ontario market. All of this would drive up the High Tide’s capital expense and can significantly affect their margins.

**Conclusion**

The global legal marijuana market is currently valued at $24.6B and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14%. Even though there are significant risks in terms of competition from Fire&Flower and Canada’s licensing system for Cannabis, High Tide currently being the market leader in the Canadian Cannabis industry is poised perfectly to capture the market in the long term and this puts them in a very strong position.

30,FAF," I'm bullish on high tide, but I'm always appreciative of legitimately thought out bear cases.

I dont disagree on the pricing in the next couple months, but I anticipate news of nasdaq uplisting soon will change that significantly. I dont see how this aspect is any better with FAF, considering their consistent downtrend at the moment. I'd say trading semi sideways with a consistent uptrend despite recent market panics is more promising. I'm aware FAF is also pursuing uplisting, but I'm not sure of their timeframe

Where are you getting the data on negative revenue from high tide's retail locations?

I also think you're overlooking HITIs ecommerce business through grasscity and smokecartel, which individually are the largest in the industry. I dont see FAFs Hifyre being competitive in any way.

I read up a bit on the FAF circle k partnership, but I'm not truly convinced of the value here. Best I see is the location market research already done by circle k slightly increasing traffic per new FAF retail location. Otherwise, the businesses are completely separate, circle k is not selling FAF products at their existing locations afaik.",MistrDarp,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/mf10l4/most_discussed_stocks_in_pennystocks_last_week/gsle68h/,0.065,0.793,0.142,0.9523
31,FAF," I'm mostly just upset I didn't get in on it sooner, as for the revenue negative stores, I could have sworn I read an article but can't seem to find it now so I must be mistaken on that.

I do think the runup from 0.25 to 0.80 is speculative and based on perceived future value rather than present fundamentals.
This of course happened with most weed stocks when the US announced intent to legalize federally, but HITI appears to have held onto more of those gains than any of the others.

I do expect it to be worth a couple dollars in a few years, but a big dip at some point before that. I'm hoping to be able to buy in at 0.6 or less

> circle k is not selling FAF products at their existing locations afaik.

They're testing out a program where they put FAF stores next to existing Circle K's, and I'm interested to see if there's a substantial increase of foot traffic for those stores compared to standalone FAF locations.",Asheam,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/mf10l4/most_discussed_stocks_in_pennystocks_last_week/gsls7lt/,0.043,0.832,0.126,0.9343

ABOUT THE COMPANY

It’s a holding company mainly engaged in Telecommunications with plenty of big name clients such as Verizon, Vodaphone, T Mobile and more. It also has subsidiaries in blockchain, EV, Liquid Fuel Distribution, fintech & financial services

In depth summaries on each of the subsidiaries they currently in are on here

[https://www.iqstel.com/](https://www.iqstel.com/)

WHY I LIKE THE COMPANY

Their YOY growth has been solid

* Debt free as of 17/2
* 4 new subsidiaries since 2020
* Management has a long TelComs history
* IT Labs (their subsidiary) is split into 4 other companies covering Chemistry, EV, Liquid Fuel
* Partnerships with Visa,Verizon and more
* They won the appliance of the year award at IOT breakthrough awards just like Apple, Amazon and GE have previously

UPCOMING CATALYSTS

Catalyst one As per their Twitter, they have news this week (16/2) and plan to announce a new fortune500 listed company as a new client.

&#x200B;

Catalyst Two Their subsidiary (IOT Labs - iQBatteries) is currently working with Modus Group to produce an EV Motorbike for Alternatesysntems ReVolt Motorbikes (I’ve emailed their investor relations for a timeline for this but haven’t got a response yet)

[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iqst--iqstel-enters-agreement-to-develop-proprietary-electric-vehicle-battery-for-alternet-systems-revolt-electric-motorcycle-301220308.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iqst--iqstel-enters-agreement-to-develop-proprietary-electric-vehicle-battery-for-alternet-systems-revolt-electric-motorcycle-301220308.html)

IQBatteries alone is looking to produce EV batteries and their new website is currently under construction e.g something is going to happen soon!

I don’t need to explain why this is big, everyone knows EVs are going to be in be one of the hottest markets for 2021 and although they’re not a major player in the EV space, this can definitely help IQST grow as a whole

Catalyst 3 VISA Partnership / MoneyOne ‘Disruptive solutions that deliver control, security,real time payments and international money transfers’

Their partnership wallet with Visa is expected to launch Q2 2021 and become a dominant player in its market ‘Money one will be recognized as a worldwide fintech company to be the ultimate choice of mobile wallet’ (per their website)

I feel like electronic wallets / payments are just getting started. Cash is less used nowadays especially with Rona and so moving all payments to online form may soon be a much greater market, this is why their vision is for 2025 they KNOW where the demand is going they’re just ahead of the game

PR / INVESTOR ENGAGEMENT

With a lot of cheap stocks / OTC stocks I believe that good customer and investor relationships are essential for growth and IQST has both.

Their Twitter is update constantly and replies to investors as best they can as well as their ‘Investors’ section on their website stays current and updated.

UPCOMING CATALYSTS

Catalyst one As per their Twitter, they have news this week (16/2) and plan to announce a new fortune500 listed company as a new client.

&#x200B;

Catalyst Two Their subsidiary (IOT Labs - iQBatteries) is currently working with Modus Group to produce an EV Motorbike for Alternatesysntems ReVolt Motorbikes (I’ve emailed their investor relations for a timeline for this but haven’t got a response yet)

[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iqst--iqstel-enters-agreement-to-develop-proprietary-electric-vehicle-battery-for-alternet-systems-revolt-electric-motorcycle-301220308.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iqst--iqstel-enters-agreement-to-develop-proprietary-electric-vehicle-battery-for-alternet-systems-revolt-electric-motorcycle-301220308.html)

IQBatteries alone is looking to produce EV batteries and their new website is currently under construction e.g something is going to happen soon!

I don’t need to explain why this is big, everyone knows EVs are going to be in be one of the hottest markets for 2021 and although they’re not a major player in the EV space, this can definitely help IQST grow as a whole

Catalyst 3 VISA Partnership / MoneyOne ‘Disruptive solutions that deliver control, security,real time payments and international money transfers’

Their partnership wallet with Visa is expected to launch Q2 2021 and become a dominant player in its market ‘Money one will be recognized as a worldwide fintech company to be the ultimate choice of mobile wallet’ (per their website)

I feel like electronic wallets / payments are just getting started. Cash is less used nowadays especially with Rona and so moving all payments to online form may soon be a much greater market, this is why their vision is for 2025 they KNOW where the demand is going they’re just ahead of the game

PR / INVESTOR ENGAGEMENT

With a lot of cheap stocks / OTC stocks I believe that good customer and investor relationships are essential for growth and IQST has both.

Their Twitter is update constantly and replies to investors as best they can as well as their ‘Investors’ section on their website stays current and updated.

BIG thanks 🙏 TO u/Domoxid

This company also sells/hosts mining equipment and mines Eth ! Which is great revenue producing attribute. If you compare it to other miners you will see how undervalued it is yourself. A lot of these miners went from .60 cents or less to 5$ plus in 6 months ! Do your own DD and you will see the upside on this stock .,Environmental_Park86,0,/r/pennystocks/comments/mfg9yf/cstr_first_dd_post_go_easy/gsnfkq8/,0.0,0.927,0.073,0.8065
