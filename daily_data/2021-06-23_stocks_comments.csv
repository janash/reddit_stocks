Some of these companies offer good services, and maybe even do a bit better than Microsoft in that particular area. But it’s laughable to choose a set of numerous, disparate vendors in an effort to get a solution that is all of 10% better but doesn’t integrate. Seriously, you’re crazy if you go that route.

One of these days, the world is going to wake up and realize that they’re paying vendors to solve miscellaneous problems, and yet they could have been paying Microsoft even less to make everything more efficient and secure.",InitializedVariable,3,/r/stocks/comments/o5w8ta/msft_closes_at_2_trillion_as_second_us_company/h2qrf1w/,0.08,0.754,0.167,0.9265

Same applies here, the *second* game pass proves even remotely profitable well see competition. We saw it happen to Netflix with competitors streaming, we saw it happen on PC with competing storefronts (Gog etc). MS without third party publishers/games simply isn't enough...



Sony on the other hand is surely late to the whole ""digital party"". That said they got *stellar first party games/studios"" and create new AAA IPs with success.

55,HUGE," Like being a gamer is a qualification to judge Microsoft’s long term game strategy. 

Don’t get me wrong, I love my PS4 and the only thing preventing me loving a PS5 is getting my hands on one. But Sony is placing all of their bets on the PS5 doing well. Their usual strategy is getting a huge hardware install base fast, and right now that’ll be a challenge with shortages. 

Microsoft is taking a small hit on the hardware install base, but they have a HUGE advantage with having Windows and Gamepass, both which don’t need to worry about having a large Xbox install base. 

There's also how much of their revenue share truly comes from gaming. Sony gets about 25% of their revenue from gaming, relies on that segment to keep the lights on, and doesn’t have much spare cash to expand that segment. 

Meanwhile gaming only makes up 9% of Microsoft’s revenue. They have cash on hand to expand, and can leverage their assets like cloud computing to expand further then physical hardware limits. They don’t need gaming, but they see it as a segment they can dominate, and that might be true if Sony doesn’t pick up the pace.",BagFullOfKittenBones,14,/r/stocks/comments/o5w8ta/msft_closes_at_2_trillion_as_second_us_company/h2p8p2y/,0.046,0.74,0.214,0.9896

Ship lease companies, $ATCO, $DAC, $NMM.

ATCO, they specialize in longterm leases with numerous of the largest size. In order to see large returns they need the lease rate to stay high because of their long contracts plus size of company. They are considered like a blue chip of their industry.

$DAC they are printing cash, ok dividend could be better but last earnings call they said don't expect much of a hike. They are paying down debt, and saving for???? Not sure, they made waves when they said building war chest. But they are signing 3 and 4 year contracts, based on current contracts they could finish out contract scrap ships, close shop and you would have enough value for mid 70's in cash. 

$NMM - Hybrid containership leasor, drybulk. If they keep signing containership lease agreements like they have been, 3-4 year making tons of cash, you will be getting the drybulk portion for free.

RDS.A: theyre still priced as an oil and gas stock but I think they're the most likely to shift successfully into renewables. BP is a somewhat distant second in this category

CVX: i think Chevron is the best positioned major to continue to pump out dividends. Well run. 

I don't believe in any of the refiners. Most of the best refineries are owned by majors, and the ones that aren't are gonna have huge drag on them by the other portfolio refineries of the refining company.

Midstream: Kinder Morgan is still the go to here. 

For the long term, I'm not bullish on any of the smaller players. Too much risk: management risk, commodity price risk, no economies of scale, political risk.

130,IMO," Aquaculture. Not a ton of big companies are publicly traded but there are a few. The ones with the most growth ahead IMO are the salmon farms aquabounty and Atlantic sapphire (aaszf). Aaszf is on the Oslo exchange, but their main production facility is in homestead florida. Both just recently started harvesting this year. Mowi and salmar are more established companies and much older, but have more environmental issues with respect to the way they are run that aqb and aaszf don’t, which I think will hurt them in the end aside from being located in Europe (shipping costs are rising making customers rethink their sourcing). There are more on exchanges like Euronext but I have yet to figure out how to access them.

For Technology, I think it is sort of a fools errand to identify a name that matters. Instead, I buy BFOCX to get most of the best companies in the field. Anytime there is a tech name I hear about and I get interested in, I discover it is already in BFOCX and go back to not caring. I am bullish on the industry itself and advise diversifying to the point where no name matters more than any other.

For Entertainment, Disney. Granted, I am in at $90/share, but still, would not be surprised to see Disney hit 5x its current valuation within a few years and end up with a ten-bagger.

Infrastructure, CLF. I really like it when a stock is in the Warren Buffet ""Yes"" pile. This is not too hard. Steel is needed. Steel is in short supply. This company is positioned to provide it advantageously.

I'm long on UBI. I don't really like their games, but I can't deny they are good at selling them. They've had a significant drop recently and don't have many huge hitters in the pipeline short term, but they have an Avatar and a Star Wars game coming up from one of their best studios, I'm pretty confident those will do very well. Their household franchises always do well.

Very bullish on Capcom even though the stock isn't doing too well right now. They're pretty much the only publisher bringing their A game this year. Monster Hunter: Rise and Resident Evil 8 both did very well and there's nothing else out so they'll continue doing well for the rest of the year. I think we'll be surprised by how well Monster Hunter Stories 2 will do. These past few years Capcom has had a crazy run putting out great games with little disappointment.

They are number one in their market with credible plans to more than double their share by 2025.  Even in a heavy downturn, they have huge numbers.  And since you raised credit quality they have the lowest default rate and highest average credit score of any major origination company.  They's a stealth fintech, containing within their structure an equivalent of Docusign, an equivalent of Lemonade, and others.

390,HUGE," So I'm definitely biased because I love Peloton as a user, and just became a (albeit tiny) investor. I think there is a ton of potential- their corporate wellness program can help them reach big companies that will buy pelotons for their gyms (at discounted rates and memberships for user), I agree with the other poster who said gyms themselves may start buying Pelotons. I know hotels and Air BnBs have already started doing this as travelers want to be able to have access to their Peloton stuff while away. Peloton has also gamified working out with badges, challenges, etc. as ways to keep people motivated. Not to mention- they have a HUGE variety of classes, and so much growth potential to other venues (boxing, rowing, and a mirror type thing have been rumored), as well as expansion into more countries. Obviously there have been missteps- but the potential is there. There are also rumors about expanding into their own wearables, as it's a pain right now to get Fitbit/Apple watches/ or other heartrate monitors to sync to their devices. They recently upgraded their heart rate monitoring aspect (Strive Score) and I think this COULD also allude to a branch out into wearables (although that's prob more of a conspiracy theory at this point, lol).

Personally, I think that the at-home gym is going to pick up, not slow down, post-COVID as people have realized and appreciate the convenience and affordability of it. This is totally all just my opinion, but as a Peloton user I can 100% see the potential.

416,LMT," There's a few types of dividend investing, I'll focus on 2 that might be good for you:

Dividend growth investing:

This strategy ignores higher yield for a higher rate of growth. Companies that have double digit dividend growth plus a strong company/moat like LMT are ideal on these cases. This is a long term strategy where your initial investment grows its output. For investors with a longer time horizon it's a good idea.

Income investing:

This strategy chases a higher yield in exchange for less growth. Covered call ETFs and high yield stocks are normally the target here, though the same aim of getting into a strong company or smartly managed fund applies here. This is a shorter term strategy that lets you live off your dividends now, so it's better for those with a shorter time horizon.

I personally just have some of each, though I'm more focused on growth than income.",SurfaceToAsh,4,/r/stocks/comments/o66faj/whats_the_best_way_to_earn_dividends/h2red4h/,0.013,0.75,0.237,0.988
417,RIO," Obviously, buy dividend paying stocks. But they're not all created equal. IMHO:

- your safest bet is a dividend fund or ETF like SCHD or HDV. these are higher-paying dividend stocks, from larger established blue-chip companies. you can get a 3-4% dividend. these stocks won't shoot up like meme stocks, but they will have modest capital appreciation over time.

- next safest bet is single stocks from these types of American companies. look up ""dividend aristocrats"", companies that have never lowered or missed a dividend for decades or even centuries. the sweet spot seems to be stocks with high *yield* but low *payout ratio*. this means the dividend is larger relative to share price, but they pay out a lower percentage of profits, because they still devote a lot of money to expansion or research/development. aristocrats: https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/dividend-stocks-aristocrats high yield/low dividend, see page 13: http://csinvesting.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/high-dividends-research-by-tweedy-browne.pdf

- US REITs are also pretty safe (but not foolproof, as the Covid lockdown proved). these are real estate investment trusts, rental properties of some type or another that pay out a lot of their income to investors. VQN pays about 2%. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VNQ

- next safest best is dividend stocks/ETFs from larger foreign blue chip companies in developed markets. IDV is an example for an ETF. Japan, Western Europe and UK commonwealth nations are relatively stable and will often pay a bit more than US stocks. Rio Tinto mining pays 4-5% https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RIO and Legal & General, a large old UK insurance company, pays 5-6% dividend. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LGGNY?p=LGGNY&.tsrc=fin-srch

- next best is something like DIV, which is very high yield US stocks in the 5% range. these are from smaller companies, or distressed companies that have raised their dividend to attract investors. this pays higher dividend than SCHD, but the companies are often lower quality and the share price is more likely to flatline for years. https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/div/

- last option is emerging markets dividends. this is the highest dividends but also highest risk, due to currency fluctuations and political risks. look at something like SDIV or DYYE. for an example, Sperbank from Russia pays a very high dividend, presently 5/6% but historically up to 8-10%. the risk is it's a Russian state-owned enterprise. ditto for China or Turkey.

494,NVDA," You said it yourself, you are thinking price goes up based on psychology not on what it actually does. Factually speaking a stock split is a nothing burger other than psychology.

Technically the right way to value a company is by how much money actually makes/can make. I have no doubt in my mind that NVDA is a fantastic company. That in no way means that it is worth the current value. 

The best way to really value a company is by imagining that you can never sell it. The only way you make money is if the company will generate enough earnings to send it to you via a dividend one day. As of right now NVDA would have to move mountains to one day dividend out enough cash to justify it's price. It could literally double for 3 years straight and then grow at 25% every year after and then you'd get your money back after 10 years. That would be insane growth and mean it basically wins the entire dedicated GPU market forever. 

If it grows at a more consistent 25% forever it will take 14 years.

Consider these figures are not even discounted at any interest rate. Everyone is investing as if rates will be <3% forever. They very well may be but is that a good way to base the success of your investment?

The only way the value of my 10 shares would stay the same is if the split applied to them.  Because no matter what on the morning of 7/20 the value of each share is going to be 1/4 of what it was at closing the night before.  There aren't going to be 2 different share prices for NVDA, one pre-split and one post-split.  So either the split applies to me (and I now have 40 shares) or I just took a 75% loss.

I do question their valuation right now but by the same token, I've seen a few estimates of them hitting $295 by end of the year.  There is a lot of enthusiasm around CRWD and cybersecurity is a hot space with everything that's happening in US right now.

When it comes to solidity, everyone knows that USA banks are involved in all kinds of fuckery, I would never let a penny into an USA account after I take profit of my investments. 

ITUB has over 300% of collateral needed for banks as per 2021. 

The financial system structure of Brazil, I can tell you my friend is the number 1 in the world and this happened because we suffered from hyper inflation a few decades ago and all the fears that you guys are afraid now. 

We suffered from scammers as well, that's why all the banks developed strong security systems. When I take a look at how ""secure"" are the USA banks it just makes me laugh, you guys adopted the 2nd factor not too long ago. 

Does that means we won't suffer from this anymore? Absolutely not, everything depends on what our government does, but it's unlikely. We don't have a FED printing money like it's nothing. About our Central Bank, by law it was declared independent to avoid political interference. 

When it comes about investing in Brazil, take note we are talking about 1 dollar for 5 real (our currency is called real). Everything is cheap to invest here aka lower valuations and that's what Buffet always take care. 

How deep do I know about financial market? Well, I'm a financial advisor here and I also set international investments for my clients. That's how I know how things work in USA, Europe and Asia.  


Now for the article, it's talking about Nubank. It's a financial start up that emerged to cheapen financial costs for their costumers, the thing is: They never profited since they born. But the startup environment is way different from a traditional company. Usually they burn cash to acquire market share and that's what Nubank is doing, they already have 35 million clients as per 2021/may. 

Buffet and other investors bet is that when it comes the time, Nubank can become profitable and then the valuation will explode even more. My only concern is: with 35 million people used to not pay any kind of account or credit card tax, how Nubank will begin to demand this? 

Regardless, most of Nubank clients are students and low income workers and don't get me wrong, but that's not exactly the clients you want to make a huge profit.

When it comes about investing in Brazil, take note we are talking about 1 dollar for 5 real (our currency is called real). Everything is cheap to invest here aka lower valuations and that's what Buffet always take care. 

How deep do I know about financial market? Well, I'm a financial advisor here and I also set international investments for my clients. That's how I know how things work in USA, Europe and Asia.  


Now for the article, it's talking about Nubank. It's a financial start up that emerged to cheapen financial costs for their costumers, the thing is: They never profited since they born. But the startup environment is way different from a traditional company. Usually they burn cash to acquire market share and that's what Nubank is doing, they already have 35 million clients as per 2021/may. 

Buffet and other investors bet is that when it comes the time, Nubank can become profitable and then the valuation will explode even more. My only concern is: with 35 million people used to not pay any kind of account or credit card tax, how Nubank will begin to demand this? 

Regardless, most of Nubank clients are students and low income workers and don't get me wrong, but that's not exactly the clients you want to make a huge profit. But, there are rumors that they are planning an IPO and probably that's when Buffet will take the most advantage by selling his investment with an inflated valuation direct to the market.

563,ATH," Putting in money at ATH is not risky in general. It depends how high it is and how much future earnings will be worth. Also on your time horizon.

If you only hold for a year, then it is really risky. If you hold for 50 years you will notice a drop but still make good money.

It is unlikely that the market as a whole will perform well over the next decade, a decline is likely or that inflation negates a majority of profits. Waiting for a crash could make sense if you know at which prices you will buy and even more if you have an alternative that will give you inflation protection.

In the end it also comes down to how long you would have to wait and how much of a drop it will be. If your time horizon is long enough, and the drop far enough (or your average buys during that time) it could make sense if a crash will happen in the next few years. If it doesn't, you will miss out on potentially massive gains.",ValueInvestor0815,0,/r/stocks/comments/o6ceht/time_in_the_market_for_latecomer_considering/h2rjkm3/,0.071,0.83,0.098,0.4953
