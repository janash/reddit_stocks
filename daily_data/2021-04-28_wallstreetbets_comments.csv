42,IMO," The 43million shares they are looking to sell at market should already have been baked into the price when they originally announced it. Regardless of what ""analysts"" claim, the price should be closer to 16-18$ a share on a bad day and potentially 20-22$ after covid clears up. I would rather see them sell the already booked 43million shares now than wait and take on higher rate borrowed debt when rates shoot up. 

Taking the 500 million off the table is really positive but we are in Bizarro World so we might see a pullback while everyone digests it. The current PreMarket price is still a good buy in level.

And then of course there's that $6 ***billion***+ in high interest debt still on the books with no discernable revenue stream to service this...those 500m shares could therefore be literally life-or-death for this company, so while nobody wants to see that kind of dilution, it's pretty likely that that's going to need to occur sometime over the next 2-3 years.

78,AMC," Good. A lot of people were concerned about AMC diluting the market with 500m shares which would give the shorts/HF a chance to cover by buying up the diluted shares, ruining the short squeeze. The CEO participated in an interview and promised they will not use any of the 500m shares they're asking for during 2021. However, people were still skeptical because he was still pushing for the vote to have 500m dilution shares at AMC's disposal if they ever needed it after 2021 ends. Now they're straight up saying they're not even going to bother vote/discuss for the 500m dilution shares for a long time, hinting as to when the squeeze is done, because the shareholders(us) don't want it. Retail investors own about 90% of the float as of currently to give you a good idea of how scary it is for the shorts.

109,MVIS," Alright, so as someone who works in robotics engineering, let me educate you apes about what this means. In short, this is extremely impressive. There's two traditional approaches to LIDAR: time-of-flight and frequency modulated continuous wave. Time-of-flight (TOF) is fairly straightforward, and is also called pulsed detection - you have a laser and a receptor, you shoot the laser at something, measure the amount of time it takes for the laser to reflect off a surface (which doesn't need to be reflective like a mirror, if you weren't eating glue during high school physics, you'd know that all surfaces reflect light), and does some simple math to calculate the distance of the object. This approach is pretty slow and it gets fucked by sunlight, since unless you have a really powerful laser, the reflection is almost always going to be weaker than sunlight. The other approach is frequency-modulated continuous wave LIDAR, also known as coherent detection. FMCW LIDAR works much in the same way, but instead of measuring the time and power of a reflected laser, it measures the frequency of the reflection against a constant waveform, and uses some spicy math to figure out the distance of the object based on the Doppler shift produced by interfering the constant waveform against the return waveform. I have less experience with FMCW, so this is a VERY basic primer on how that approach works.

In any case, LIDAR has two big issues when operating in the field (at least in my experience) - interference from sunlight and a lack of range. Both are solved by slapping a more powerful laser on the sensor platform, but people seem to take issue with lasers that can cause serious burns and start fires. With the laser power restrictions in mind, you're really limited as to what you can do. FMCW has some promising results in terms of solving these issues, but there's a bunch of issues relating to the signal/noise ratio of such a sensitive signal. 

This platform from MVIS is a massive improvement - they claim that their platform is ""immune to sunlight interference"", which I'm somewhat skeptical of, but even the 250m range is EXCELLENT with a 30Hz sampling frequency. I'm not sure what exactly they're doing, but it seems likely that they've figured out a way to improve traditional approaches to FMCW in order to claim such a large range improvement at that sampling rate. Speaking of, the 30Hz sampling rate is also a very important bit of information, and it's pretty impressive. Normally, of speed, precision, and range, you can pick two. The sensor characteristics that they claim are REALLY good for a 30Hz sensor, and that sampling frequency is only going to improve with time. As it stands, this opens up a lot of possibilities for applications that LIDAR has traditionally been too imprecise, slow, or expensive to be practical in. The big one is autonomous cars, but this could also see use in robotics, military applications, consumer electronics, and VR/AR. 

TL;DR: Bullish as fuck, the science is impressive.

2.	Sell 780 strike 

You effectively created a bear call spread. If GME stays below 780, you keep entire credit, win and profit. Of course profit is capped, but profit is profit

327,LOVE," You think if a stock has a move on a day that it means it's a short squeeze?

&#x200B;

Here, let me explain to you how this is going to go down:

All you Capuchins are going to pile in and drive up the price based on the fact that big money is going to let you do it for a moment.  Hell, they're even going to buy into it with you to accelerate the price.

&#x200B;

Then, when they've got enough of you in the cage, they'll run the rugpull.exe program on you (using shares th ey were buying with you to artificially drive up the price) and wipe your asses out by low-selling and drying up all the buy liquidity, which will cause all you paper handers to cut bait and all you diamond handers to become bag holders.

&#x200B;

Then the cycle will start again.

&#x200B;

They already participate in the illicit market so have no issue with illegality.  If you do some research, that is precisely what they are already doing. They are actually buying magic mushrooms etc illegally to help with their anxiety or addiction issues as they, like everyone else, are reading these studies as they are reported in the press. In the end, I see many of these psychedelics becoming legal but difficult to patent or protect with IP in any substantive way.   Im invested in Red Light Holland (TRIP/TRUFF) heavily for this reason as Bruce Linton has experience with this idea of turning the illegal into legal with regulations with his success with Canopy. That being said,  I have a small position in Mind med too due to the versatility of their studies. Im also invested in Field Trip as it has its hands in everything. I think the psychedelics investor community is currently blinded by companies focused on studies which will take years and require lots of luck. Legislation for legalization/decriminalization seems like it will outpace these studies and at any rate, I see consumers mostly preferring an organic natural substance as opposed to the synthetic pill.  Even celebrities are already microdosing.  How is Mind Med or Compass going to charge hundreds of dollars for a pill in 3-5 years which is already so cheap illegally? I dont see it.  They are making the same mistakes that they did with Cannabis just in a different way.

380,IP," Three flaws with what you're saying:

1. The NNT will improve.  There has only been one study that directly compared psilocybin to an SSRI, and by all educated accounts (I'm a psychologist who studies psychedelics), it was a VERY poorly conducted study for a variety of reasons.  Many researchers in the field were pissed off about how much of a faceplant that study was and how it hurt the whole field's reputation.  Hold tight, and the next wave of better-designed studies will show what some of the earlier exploratory research started to show: psilocybin is much more potent at treating depression than SSRIs.
2. From what I understand, the junk IP that companies like Compass have been pushing is part of a ""throw everything at the wall and see what sticks"" strategy.  I think they know there's a lot of junk, and that's just some internecine warfare between companies.  I'm speculating here, but I don't think the success of these companies is going to come from IP.  It's going to come from partnerships with other entities in the medical field.
3. Oral dissolving formulations (which several companies are developing) will shorten the time frame of drugs like psilocybin without the need for an antagonist and all the problems that would come with them.  So, that's one novel, patentable formulation of a known compound that isn't bullshit and will have an appreciable effect on the cost effectiveness of the therapy.  MNMD might be more LSD-centric, so maybe this doesn't help them, but let's not paint the whole field with the same brush.  

That being said, I am skeptical about MNMD as ""the one"" to buy.  It's currently overvalued, it will be years before the company's profitability will be put to the test.  I'm planning to invest in the Horizons Psychedelic ETF, since the field as a whole is sure to explode, albeit in a way that makes it hard to pick winners.

389,DD," I think you underestate the efficacy of psychedelic assisted therapies. For instance, Dr. Griffiths found an 85% success rate for smoking cessation after a single dose of psylocibin. Compare against other leading treatments (craving reduction drugs for instance).

Bupoprion apparently has a 75% reported positive effect. But that's not after *a single dose* like in the case for psylocibin. And that's just for nicotine addiction. Ibogaine has had a very impressive success rate to treat addictions of a more dangerous type (see that god-tier DD you linked to). MNMD is pursuing a non toxic version of this compound (Ibogaine is dangerous in itself) to treat those types of addictions. And this compound is *proprietary*. 

There is good research on end of life anxiety treatment using psychedelics. However, those studies are limited. Basically, the studies exist because the patient was terminal. So the study could be done ""safely"". There still isn't enough rigourous research on psychedelic assisted therapies to treat anxiety in non-terminal patients. Nor is there enough rigorous research done on psychedelic assisted therapies to treat all sorts of other mental health disorders. 

The potency of psychedelic compounds is proven. But you seem to imply that we know what we need to know about them because we've been studying them since the 50s. Which I think is misleading. Considering there has been a war on them since then, studies have been made extraordinarily difficult. And what little research has been done has shown that psychedelics are very promising as medicine. Now there is big boy capital being raised to do this research and to bring a product to market. 

You make some good points that are worth thinking about, especially about competition. But as of now MNMD is blowing the competition out of the water. It could be that when the research results come out and they are less than favorable (hint, we've already gotten some results and they have been boss AF: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfYisIQ9Z40&t=508s) then we will have a much better bear case. 

Your points about competition is real. The leading competitors in the sector simply do not have the pipeline or the staff that MNMD. It doesn't matter to what extent staff are involved in MNMD. Most companies in the sector are young and operate roughly the same. It's not like Gabor Mate is working in the Nanaimo lab for NUMI. 

The thing is that this sector is new which will bring more capital in to do proper research. And considering the research we do have already suggests strong results. I am confident more research will simply further substantiate the effectiveness of psychedelics as medicine. And so far, MNMD is ahead of the pack. 

I think your best bearish point is big pharma not taking kindly to a potential new kid on the block acting as a disruptor. This is sort of both a bull and bear case. If big pharma is threatened that means MNMD is the real deal. But frankly, that's still years into the future. Lots could happen between now and then. As an investor I look at the pipeline, the research, the business model and the CEO.

Yet your weak ass paperhanded reptilian brain is scared. Here's why.

**The product** : So basically like almost all its competitors ([atai-linked](https://www.atai.life/programs/), [numinus](https://numinus.ca/clinics), [cybin](https://www.cybin.com/), etc) this company decided ~~not to invest in any meaningful drug discovery. Instead they bought pipelines for well known compounds. Bonus, you can say on your website you already passed the ""pre discovery"" stage. No shit. It's done since the '50s. Candy-flipping is not ""next-gen"", sorry. Ibogain derivatives are not that good.~~  **>>>They are working with MindShift (from Switzerland on next generation psychedelics and have filed patents immediately for at least 2 brand new compounds. There are also other promising leads. This avenue, however, will reap benefits 15 years from now. In the meantime, MindMed is focused on currently available psychedelics, especially LSD. They are by far the most advanced with LSD than ANY other competitor. Derivatives of Ibogain are no good? BS. 18-MC is off the charts. Do you even research?<<<**

**The market :** Psychedelics work, right? Yeah.

* For MDD (depression), they are only slightly more efficient than first intent antidepressants. And how efficient are antidepressants? Well not much. They have NNT ranging between 7 and 20. What's a NNT? Wait you were going to invest in a FUCKING BIOTECH without knowing what a NNT is? NNT (number needed to treat) indicate how good something is relative to a control. With a NNT of 7, an antidepressant will beat doing nothing 1 time out of 7. Yup. **That's shit**. Why? Because we know jackshit about how depression really works, and however smooth our brains are, it appears they still remain very complicated thing (I guess that's a good thing?).What does it mean? It means LSD, Shrooms, or whatever shitty therapy you can imagine with psychedelics will work for some and won't for the others. Which means MNMD will have to share the MDD market with the approx. **50** other fucking antidepressants. ~~Also J&J's Spravato is less invasive and has better results.~~ **>>>Most of the above is just fluff. But surprised he mentions Spravato is better. Results for ketamine (is it even a psychedelic) came out recently from a study, and they weren't good (**[**https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/949457**](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/949457)**) The next link just one of hundreds about how researchers say that psychedelics work.**[**https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/20/psychedelics-depression-treatment-psychiatry-psilocybin**](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/20/psychedelics-depression-treatment-psychiatry-psilocybin) **<<<**
* For anxiety. Is it gonna be the same? NO. MNMD is right on that one. The NNT of benzos is approx. 3 depending on the study. LSD is estimated to be around 2. That's nice. But don't pre-order your lambo yet. Benzos are fucking easy to use, and they are addictive. Many people won't tolerate psychedelics, won't have the time for it, or are afraid of the compound to begin with (thx war on drugs). The pharma industry won't let a hipster's biotech ruin its profits. So they'll either lobby against (if you are a physician it's good news, more free cruises in the coming years) or bring their own psychedelic drugs on the table (and they'll be better than acid). Acid antagonists will just compound problems. ~~All their pipeline is based on the premise that they can safely stop a trip with this antagonist. Else the patient will be tripping balls for too long, making the treatement unpractical compared to other psychedelics and state-of-the-art anxiolytics. That mean pushing 2 pipelines plus a combined drug pipeline to reach market.~~ **>>>more fluff. So big bad pharma will come after them? please. The crossed out part is flat out wrong... so wrong I will just say it's a flat out lie. Possibly the opposite of that statement is true, actually.<<<**
* For addiction. Didn't find anything bearish about it except that it might not get approved, like for any other biotech.
* ADHD. There's no exclusive market in selling microdosed lsd, but it might just work. The data isn't here to predict the success of the therapy yet.

**The IP :** It's gonna be a fucking bloodbath. Almost all the psychedelic biotech decided to work with the same exact compounds because they are inept at innovation (more below). There gonna be a lot of overlap, and many lawsuits. Even better, almost all the IP I found related to the psychedelics applications is very badly written, and, put mildly, trash. Bullish on IP law firms.**>>>Not convinvinced much of this applies to MindMedicine. They are focused on many chemicals that no one else focusing on. Also, they are way ahead in the trials.<<<**

**The people :** In biotech, the idea isn't worth anything. Execution is the only thing that matter (and luck). So who's behind MNMD? They have anywhere between 25 and 40 employees depending on how you count, good thing if you [work there](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mindmedco/people/), you'll have a nice title for your resume as you're either a C-suite or a director or at least a lead. And most of them don't work-work for MNMD, they are just consultants, or also work on some other stuff on the side, because well, you don't need that much businessmen in such a young biotech.They outsourced all of their innovation capacities to their academic collaborators. Which is smart. Or not. It will make scaling up extremely tedious without acquiring everybody else. They don't have the chemical know-how, and neither the patents, to produce. They'll need to partner with a big pharma or buy/merge someone, which will considerably reduce the profits. They also don't have much expertise in regulatory affairs either so that's 1 more (costly) outsourcing. Their current philosophy is ""throw money at it"". Which has been proven to fail in the biotech/pharma world, see eroom's law. What about the AI guys (the whole handful of them)? They come from the famous HealthMode (and also related Merlon) company. Never heard of them? Because they never put a product on the market.Basically the company is a weird employee merger between weed company veterans, an obscure 2 California based Czechoslovak AI companies and some expensive-ass consultant-executives.

~~TL;DR : Mindmed is trying hard to appear as the next big thing but all they have is a highly contested pipeline of low-innovation drugs. They are stretched thin between Drug Development and AI and lack the proper verticality to achieve success, but are too high-level to succeed as an horizontal growth company. Ride the hype while it lasts i guess.~~

401,IMO," Solid post. It will take them a while to get off the ground. Academia --> market is always difficult. But we can't ignore the massive strides in research in this field recently. 

Yes, we're basically going back to where we were in the 50s. But I think the future is bright. MindMed will go up, but it's likely it won't survive in the long-term. With nine nascent research projects in early stages, they have a lot of options. 

To me, the ketanserin project is exciting. Ketanserin blocks seratonin receptor 2A, responsible for hallucinations. Psilocybin-dosed, depressed mice given ketanserin got the antidepressant effects of psiloycbin without hallucinations. 

But this is one of ~ten projects, all of which are in very early stages, and any of which could fail. But really, all MindMed needs is one of these projects to go to market.

410,MNMD," > well why wouldn't these addicts just go ahead and buy these drugs illegally to solve their addiction problem?

The drugs aren't a miracle cure. what MNMD is in the business of is ""psychedelic assisted *therapies*"". And they are not just developping the drug, they are developping the distribution and treatment infrastructure. 

People who treat addicts are the ones who would be using these drugs. The drugs being illegal means there is no proven protocol for treatment and also means it's fucking illegal for a therapist to use them. But if it's legal and there is a scientifically proven safe way to use the drugs then the people who treat addiction have a tool for treatment. 

In addition to this, MNMD has a proprietary ibogaine based compound that the are developping. Ibogaine which has a good track record of treating addicts is also dangerous physically. But research and compounds developped from Ibogaine could help make it safe to use in treatment. 

As for the decrim thing, as I understand it decrim doesn't need to happen for a drug to pass FDA approval.

If the person receiving therapy is skeptical and doesn't trust their therapist those feelings might be amplified under psychedelics. Likewise, if someone is in a poor state of mind, psychedelics might amplify those feelings and leave them with a traumatic experience if they never used psychedelics before. On those shows, people with addiction issues would typically relapse shortly after. Microdosing with MDMA and psychedelics might be more effective.

You have to listen  to one of the fathers of psychedelic research, who has been conducting research for more than 30 years. In Europe,  they have been doing research for much longer than in the u.s.

 ""However, the researcher would not speak of a “child prodigy” for a long time, as he distinguishes himself from the American euphoria.  And calls headlines, according to which one is cured forever after a single dose, as “nonsense”: “That is the American groove, their belief in feasibility.  The Americans have an idea, grab it and run. ""  Psychiatry in Europe is more grounded.  He himself has already had inquiries from young American investors who see psychedelics as the business that is being done with cannabis in the USA today.  They'd rather patent a substance like psilocybin today rather than tomorrow.""

Just look at 2020 drug approvals [here](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/new-drugs-fda-cders-new-molecular-entities-and-new-therapeutic-biological-products/novel-drug-approvals-2020).

It's because pharma is a sales industry, biotech is a medicine industry. It makes sense for pharma to achieve economies of scale in salesmanship while outsourcing the creation of new drugs.

Not only is it time consuming to create a new drug, but it's expensive. The average cancer drug biotech needs $200M off the bat. The average success rate of a cancer biotech is 5%.

About 10 years ago I was deep in it and was really done. I randomly tuned into an am radio station while driving that had the Thom Heartman show on and just when I tuned in he said, ""our next segment, magic mushrooms can cure depression"". The timing couldn't have been better. Listened to the story about the research Johns Hopkins had done and decided to turn around and try the one thing I hadn't. Long story short, after doing the recommend dose, 3.5 grms, I was amazed. The experience was incredible but more importantly I was better. I haven't had symptoms since, no more drugs, no more suicidal thoughts and feel everything more fully. Now I dose twice a year and have never felt better.

Or open market hedge funds have their computer servers directly next to the NYSE which allows them to transact faster and buy the shares before anyone else . I’m just asking because it seems like what happened was the perfect conspiracy to make everyone happy their was no dilution while maybe allowing the hedge funds to cover . This allows hedge funds to get off cheap and amc doesn’t lose retail interest. I wouldn’t put the amc board past a bribe and even if it’s open market offering hedge funds and buy them to cover shorts before anyone else gets a chance .,lukebreit,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n0fo2q/entire_life_savings_into_amc_calls/gw6o9zx/,0.088,0.794,0.118,0.7506

528,AMC," I'm not a big GME bull (I think it's a $40 stock based on fundamentals) but there is little comparison between their situations. GME has an existing revenue chain, that is slowly declining, but exists. They have no debt and $500m of cash on hand. They are saddled with 5500 stores but the leases mostly expire within 2 years so it's easy to close down most of them and transition to selling stuff online, keeping just the most profitable stores in place. 

AMC had to borrow so much money just to survive COVID they are screwed going forward even if business jumps up to 2019 levels. And given the few number of block busters in the pipline such a revenue return is unlikely until 2022 at the earliest, maybe never, depending on how streaming goes. 

The only solution for a company saddled with so much debt is to try to issue their way out which they did. From 100m shares to 500m shares. And as long as retail is dumb enough to keep buying their shares (debt) then they can muddle along. But sooner or later something will happen, retail will lose faith, and this company will be in bad shape.",terrybmw335,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n0fo2q/entire_life_savings_into_amc_calls/gw7vx6o/,0.127,0.75,0.123,-0.4297

I would think GME would fare far better setting up pro game tournament eco system rather than being yet another e-commerce system when there is Wal-Mart, Target, Amazon and god knows who else to get your console from. And thats a once every what, 2-4 year expense? Especially considering most people just buy software directly now.

Also, AMC is saddled with debt, do you know how much debt AMC are in? I imagine the AMC venues are far greater of an expense than the GME stores. Specifically for Covid, it seems like they would have pulled in a lot of the govt rescue money.

537,GME," Thank you so much for the detailed reply!! It's really helpful.

Also congrats on the GME calls!!!

I guess my confusion is that you say an option seller is obligated to deliver if those options are exercised. But if he closes his position by selling the options now doesn't that technically put him at risk for an obligation to deliver in the extreme case where someone chose to exercise them or it expired ITM on some unlikely squeeze later?",neutrino64575,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n0fo2q/entire_life_savings_into_amc_calls/gw7rlop/,0.05,0.863,0.086,0.4672
538,BSM," I’m glad you asked. 

Theta is obviously the “time decay” of an option so the rate of change of the value for an option, portfolio or swap/future derivative in relation to time with everything else remaining constant. Theta is typically presented in a by day calculation (which is why it seems so small at -0.00123) but in reality when theta is calculated it is expressed as a yearly number. Now by buying a far OTM call option like OP has, his theta is initially low because of how far out it is but as time passes and the price stays below the strike of $25 it will continue to increase in a negative manner -1, -2 and so on until the contracts are worthless in which case theta will have eaten the whole position. Now as for how this relates to BSM it is broken down into the following equation: -[(Stock Price*N’(d1)*volatility)/(2*SQRT(Time))]- (risk free rate*strike price*E^-(risk free rate*time)*N(d2). And that’s just theta for a basic call. If you don’t know what d1 and d2 are then you should read up on it and both of their relations to other Greek calculations/options calculations. 

Obviously other Greeks, mainly Delta and Gamma, as well as IV all play into the value of the options and as I mentioned earlier the IV is ridiculously high at 143% so regardless of if his theta was -0.000000001 it would take a parabolic movement to even begin to slightly profit off of such a position. 

I can help explain IV to you next if you need it. Just let me know :)

578,DD," the science with Psychedelic is advancing and seems promising--but what makes mind med such a good choice compared to all the other companies in this crowded space? they are far from alone and as best as i can tell don't have anything that sets them apart other than a slightly more diverse pipeline. a diverse pipeline is great but its arguably better to have the entire or large market share for one drug and/or pathology (ie first line for MDD or GAD).

I think the real issue here is that people are getting confused about the difference between being excited by the advancements being made with regard to Psychedelics and whether Mind med specifically is a good investment.

Edit TLDR: you can believe in the science/potential but also realize MNMD is a very risky investment. Lots of companies--and some very large pharma companies--are also studying the same compounds and MNMD doesn't have any exclusive drugs in their pipeline other than an aerosolized LSD-antagonist/reversal agent.

583,MNMD," Finishing my doctorate in clinical psychology (one year away, woo!) and am very interested in this approach to treatment.  I fully anticipate opening a practice that utilizes psychedelics in the future but it's many years off until that actually occurs.  The first psychedelic expected to be granted regulatory approval is MDMA through the MAPS organization because they're the furthest along in the phase 3 FDA trial but it's not even expected to clear these hurdles until 2025.  MAPS is also a nonprofit and will likely be able to drastically undercut MNMD on prices for these substances in the future as long as MAPS gets there first in terms of clearing regulatory hurdles.  They'll already have approvals for MDMA under their belt by the time they move on to psilocybin (which they are already doing) and will likely be able to do the same undercutting for that substance as well.  Psilocybin is arguably the most exciting substance in this approach to treatment thus far and is incredibly cheap to produce- a profit-seeking company like MNMD will have a very difficult uphill battle to fight every step of the way.

Pair this with the complete lack of knowledge about the efficacy of these treatments by the vast majority of people in my field and you have a huge problem for MNMD.  I'm quite literally the only person in my program who ever discusses this approach to treatment- the faculty are completely unaware that this is a thing or only have tangential knowledge about what used to take place prior to the beginning of the ""war on drugs.""  This is going to radically shift approaches to mental health treatment but it's **a decade** away at least from being a reality in the grand scheme of things.  This approach to treatment currently requires special training as it's radically different from every other approach taught thus far.  There's simply no infrastructure in place for such a radical shift to occur in any sort of meaningful way that will make this company viable for a long, long time.",Substantial_Papaya,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n0emqp/mnmd_a_story_of_forecasts_and_fundamentals/gw6lvjf/,0.081,0.823,0.095,0.6501

592,MNMD," That's the problem- suboxone generates more profit because users go back to it time and time again.  Psychedelics are currently being researched and marketed as one-time use ""cures"" for these issues.  I think there will be greater room for clients to undergo multiple psychedelic experiences as this approach to treatment is expanded but that's many years down the road.  The comparison to Suboxone in this post makes little sense given these factors and MNMD is not likely to be able to reproduce those profit margins with an alternative.

To be fair, microdosing may see the greatest profit margins but sound studies on microdosing for noticeable benefits have *barely* been started in the last couple of years.  The research that's out there is largely anecdotal and needs to be much more robust before it's even seriously considered by the FDA.",Substantial_Papaya,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n0emqp/mnmd_a_story_of_forecasts_and_fundamentals/gw6nm23/,0.024,0.8,0.176,0.9781

616,ACA,"  here is the exact part of todays factsheet:

**Extend expanded ACA premiums tax credits in the American Rescue Plan.** Health care should be a right, not a privilege, and Americans facing illness should never have to worry about how they are going to pay for their treatment. No one should face a choice between buying life-saving medications or putting food on the table.  President Biden has a plan to build on the Affordable Care Act and lower prescription drug costs for everyone by letting Medicare negotiate prices, reducing health insurance premiums and deductibles for those who buy coverage on their own, creating a public option and the option for people to enroll in Medicare at age 60, and closing the Medicaid coverage gap to help millions of Americans gain health insurance. The American Families Plan will build on the American Rescue Plan and continue our work to make health care more affordable.  The American Rescue Plan included a historic investment in reducing Americans’ health care costs.  The biggest improvement in health care affordability since the Affordable Care Act, the American Rescue Plan provided two years of lower health insurance premiums for those who buy coverage on their own, saving families an average [of $50 per person per month](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/03/12/fact-sheet-american-rescue-plan-reduces-health-care-costs-expands-access-insurance-coverage.html).  The American Families Plan will make those premium reductions permanent, a $200 billion investment.  As a result, [nine million](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/03/12/fact-sheet-american-rescue-plan-reduces-health-care-costs-expands-access-insurance-coverage.html) people will save hundreds of dollars per year on their premiums, and [four million](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/what-if-american-rescue-plans-enhanced-marketplace-subsidies-were-made-permanent-estimates-2022) uninsured people will gain coverage.  The Families Plan will also invest in maternal health and support the families of veterans receiving health care services. ",saint242,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n044k0/why_tomorrow_may_be_the_day_to_buy_clov_no_short/gw5q33s/,0.042,0.758,0.2,0.9937

1057,MVIS," Real talk here:  let's face it, very often stonks go DOWN after an earnings call even if the news was favorable, especially if there's been a big runup before earnings which is the case here.  Price adjusts to the reality of the news, not the optimism.  And MVIS earnings have always been negative, I don't expect that to change this afternoon.  The only way I see it jumping after earnings is if they make forward looking comments about new contracts, etc. that will help earnings in the future.  

The ""real news"" that I would think boosts the stock has already been published (link below), so the stock price already has that built in.

Instead, they cut themselves fat checks, attempted to dilute shares and only pulled out realizing how fucked they'd be to piss off their most loyal and only remaining supporters.

I'm in with 2k shares on CLOV, so don't take this the wrong way.    


Two points. 

1)  When you just dismiss something out of hand, it does take away from your otherwise great writing.    


""As you can see it says deceleration on the top left. This is ok because the stock is so young id just ignore that since we've clearly bottomed out now.""  


If it's so clear, why doesn't the marker, whatever it is, show that?  If you dismiss something out of hand, it appears you're trying to hide something.  Most people, especially those who have been manipulated for years in the market, can see that.  


2) Your closing.  ""We just need volume"" requires a whole lot of other things in order to happen.  A news release, continued buying by lots of retail and no selling from institutions, something outside of our control.  Government mandate that everyone use CLOV.

1172,AMD," Ok, I'm going to tag my thoughts about AMD in the datacenter as a system admin/engineer in a medium size company with massive growth goals over the next 5 years. 

We absolutely aren't looking at ARM chips for datacenter work, and their lack of compatibility with legacy line of business software is a drawback for even end-user work. (We're using entirely x64 traditional architecture in our fleet right now.) 

As Hyperconverged network/virtualization/storage/compute infrastructure continues to grow in the datacenter world, AMD will need to compete with non-traditional companies in this sector like Cisco, but I believe the cost of Cisco Hyperconverged infrastructure limits their appeal to many SMB size companies. 

Lastly, I see regular advertisements from HPE (our current vendor) showcasing the benefits of AMD processors in the datacenter, but I see little from Dell EMC and some other vendors we are working with. If AMD can secure the kind of exposure they are getting from HPE with other vendors and increase their name recognition and reputation in the Datacenter market, thats going to be a massive boost to sales.

1235,MVIS," This is the way… On stocks you know and understand. 

This one falls outside that circumference for me. The other 10 I currently hold I know intimately and use their products every day and fully understand the reasons why I bought them. MVIS is the first day trading I have done since the technology boom when I was in my 20s. Probably inspired by you retards. But after one week of it I remember why I got the fuck out of daytrading. It’s just not for me. And I played professional poker for a year and they are not fucking around when they say this is a casino. It is the same vibe. It is the same highs and lows. It is not for me. I buy long-term and companies I believe in and use. The trick is to get in early. For example I know many friends who use medical marijuana and I have been inside the Curaleaf dispensary many times and seen the way they run their operation, I’ve tasted their products, :) and I just feel like I have a complete handle on their business. Got in at five and it’s been my greatest moneymaker for the last couple years. That’s how I like to do it. Pouncing on MVIS eight days ago after reading a great due diligence report it was one of the riskier moves I’ve made in the last 20 years and I don’t plan to do it again unless another Ape blows me away with a report like that. 

Honestly I bought it at 11 thinking other people would feel the same way I would I was planning on eventually exiting at 18. When it blew up to 13 the very next day I took the gains. Then I completely man in my strategy and chased. Then I got crushed and had to cost average down. And then one today a crossed back over my threshold for gain I just took the money off the table and walked away. I just don’t have that in me anymore. And also I don’t find it to be as powerful as strategy as the one outlined above. But if I was a young Turk again I’d probably ride MVIS.",HappyGoLuckyBoy,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n0h35b/mvis_porn_come_take_a_ride_with_me/gw6t0hk/,0.039,0.832,0.129,0.9898
1236,DD," Love to hear it!  Congrats.  Getting in early is literally the night and day difference in this game.  I'm in on MVIS at 10, and it goes to 20, and then drops to 13, sure, I feel a LITTLE bad I didn't sell, but I'm still up overall so I shrug and just keep living.  But if I chase and get in at 15, it runs to 20, then down to 12, I feel like 1000xs worse because I'm now in the red, vs. the guy who got in early and is still bothered, but doesn't feel like dogshit.

Entrance price is everything for a long-term play.  So much easier to deal with the highs and lows.  If I was long on MVIS I would have held after buying in at 11, but my whole point was to see if I could predict the stock that WSB would move on, because I personally felt something powerful when reading a certain piece of DD, and I was pretty sure anyone else reading it would too.

I executed more trades in my 20s in 1 year than I have done cumulatively in 2 decades since then.  Anybody with some history in the game would absolutely fucking love what I did here, it's filled with brilliance, and complete fuck ups, just like life.  And in the end I came out ahead 3K over the course of 1 week.  I'll take it.

I don't disagree with buying and holding, that's my main strategy.  But if you wanna day trade, and you look at the above and go, ""Pfffft... you shoulda just held,' then guess what, bro?

1239,DD," That's the wrong question. 

The question is, when is the next buy-in that intersects with YOUR personal goals on the trade?

If the goal is a day-trade quick hit, I wouldn't go near it at 23 right now price-wise; and I wouldn't go near it time-wise with Earnings tomorrow.

If the goal is a potential long-term ticket to the moon, I'd watch like a fucking hawk tomorrow and start buying if/when the street reacts positively.  If they like the news tomorrow, I don't see it tanking anytime soon.  Just get in early after the earnings (if they are good).   If it tanks after earnings on bad news,, then quite obviously buy in on the dip... I like it at 18. 

But again, do you know what they do?  For a long-term ticket to the moon, you better know exactly what company you're buying and why you like them.

I sold a bunch of shit recently and bought google because I'm obsessed with YouTube's STILL potential.  Today it popped 5%.  Fuckin' Google!

1252,DD," Fair enough, but definitely not an 'ouchable' offense.

Also  we quite clearly disagree with what paper-hands means.  Paper handing it has a far lesser role in day trading.  The term was meant for long-term  plays, i.e., don't get paper hands and abandoning a stock you like just because of rough waters.

That is NOT what happened here, anywhere along the way.

In fact, I'd argue you can't paper hand a day trade. Literally, the point is to sell within a short span. I was never long on MVIS.  So I think you are using the term wrongly. 

Here's a walk through of the above trades, for anyone interested: 

1) I read a DD that blows my mind, and think, ""Fuck, if I feel this way, maybe others will read, and jump on board.""  I wake up the next day and the stock is off to the races.  I jump in late but get on. 

2)  Within 24 hours, I'm up 16% on this flyer.... $1700 in 24 hours.  Now, if this was a long-term diamond hand, sure, I'm not budging.  But this play was ALWAYS about selling once I get a decent return.  That's where, with all due respect, anyone who can't recognize the value of $1700 in 24 hours honestly is a chump and a bag holder.  It's akin to 5,840% on the year.  If you don't learn how to take a $1700 gain off the table in 24 hours, you're fucking toast in this game.  You NEED these micro-trade gains to withstand rough waters in your long positions.  I stand behind this move 1000%.

3) Now, comes the problem.  I'm at a guys weekend that we look forward to all year; we are drinking and talking about the stock, and I'm watching it climb and climb. So I excuse myself to an upstairs room, filled with booze and other things, and I jump back in at 16.6.  A bit of a chase, but I'm fine with the move.  

4)  Here comes the really interesting part.  The life part.  As I""m sitting there, watching it sink from 16 down to 14, evaporating my $1700 gain, I start to feel nauseous.  WTF am I doing?  There were still 2 days left in my guys weekend, and I was upstairs hovered over a keyboard like a fucking loner loser.  It dawns on me that if I stick with this stock, I'm literally going to be a ghost, a shell of myself, all weekend, as I sweat and panic MVIS, while all my friends are playing guitars, drinking, socializing, etc.  So as soon as it climbs back up to breakeven or so, I bail.  Literally just 15 minutes later.  That's why you see that anomaly there. And I stand by this move too.  I chose 3 days with my buds over stalking the stock.  But that's something you can only learn as you live life: what price do you put on your experiences?  In this day and age, a social weekend with my best buds is invaluable, and I wasn't going to ruin it by checking out and stalking the ticker all weekend.  So I sell and enjoy the weekend.  I like the move.  I have my $1700 still. 

5)  On Monday, as it flies up to 28, I'm definitely kicking myself, and out comes my absolute worst move in the chain.  I start thinking moon rocket, and I don't want to miss it.  Sign me up.  Buy in at like 29, and watch it plummet.  I will take all shit for this trade.

6) Down to 19, I can either take my bruises and walk away down 6k or so, or I can cost average down to about 23.  This decision took a long time, and I can't get into the reasons I decided to do it, as it comes down a myriad of personal factors.  But I did and purchased another 700.

7) Yesterday it shows signs of dying, just trickling around, and all day long, I contemplate exiting the position and wiping my hands clean of MVIS.  But again, a series of signs and instinct tell me one more day.  If you owned MVIS and you weren't fucking shitting your pants about what might happen today, you are lying.  Today was EASILY the day to 'paper-hand' it in your words, and a quick scan at WSB will show you many people who were in my exact position who bailed and took the loss.  I didn't.  All day yesterday I dug deep for an iron stomach, and held, and when I woke up today, I set up my phone and strapped in for a long day of watching. 

8)  Today at many points along the way, I could have bailed, and reduced losses from 6k to 4k to 2k etc.  I didn't flinch.  I waited.  Cashed out about +$1300. 

You can wipe your ass with your paper hands.",HappyGoLuckyBoy,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n0h35b/mvis_porn_come_take_a_ride_with_me/gw73g3g/,0.084,0.792,0.124,0.9868

1274,TA," A stock's price at any given time is an equilibrium point between buyers and sellers. The trend in the stock price depends on the (a) the historic stock price, i.e. are buyers willing to pay this? are sellers willing to sell at this? and (b) prediction for the future sell price.

Forget the prediction of a stock's price movement - at its most fundamental the market is about supply and demand. TA trends (e.g. head and shoulders, double/triple tops and bottoms) are just manifestations of the buy/sell equilibrium negotiations. TA tells you who won the past few battles and based on who won, you can get a pretty good guess as to how the war's going...

Put it another way, you're telling me buyer and seller sentiment is NOT at all influenced by the current price of the stock and what it's done in the past? Really?",baconara,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n0k8m3/quick_47k_in_less_than_20_minutes_scalping_googl/gw806ri/,0.046,0.842,0.112,0.924

1276,GME," Cramer is the consummate insider and realist. 

A great investor, if he was private, if he did happen to get burned initially in the GME story, I think he would have taken his losses and go long for the ride. JMO.

This will one of the great all-time stories on the street and the first display of real muscle by the ""organized"" retail investor all thanks to the reddit platform. 

Don't kid yourselves, the HFs have had their own dark web reddit-like platform in play for decades, with mouthpieces in the media and especially CNBC pushing their narrative.

So here is my take on GME. 

Will it hit $10,000 a share? Maybe, but look to the government to step in at some point. The investment/financial community routinely pays off politicians- Biden has been one of their water-carriers ever since he was elected. And they can use connections and options to push the day of reckoning out months, hoping that the retail investors will tire and cash in.

WSB has 10 million members. How many actively trade stocks? I would say all of them. How many have been burned at some time by the shenanigans of HFs and know it? Well, let's say half. So they hate the HFs. But it takes more than hate to pull this off.

Now, how many members have been successful enough at investing and have been burned enough by the HFs to want to jump into GME and buy 100 shares?  And hang on to them in a non-margin account for months or years if necessary and  risk losing a large amount of money just to stick it to the HFs and a corrupt system (the DTCC and Cede&co)? 

Let's say about 5%. That percentage includes me.

So 500,000 motivated retail investors hanging on to 100 shares each is 50  million shares total- five million more than the 45 million share float.

They also have sold handheld projectors and mobile phone projector units, and they have a consumer LiDAR division, but they've never been shy about discussing their customers/partners on those products (but aren't currently selling any). They had a $100M contract lined up with a big 'Tier 1' tech company last year for an interactive smart speaker that got cancelled when COVID hit. They were also under an NDA for that but everyone thinks it was Amazon.

I can't recall if they've ever come out and said that the current revenue is from the AR division, but the teardown confirms they have parts in the HL2 and the timelines match up and Microsoft is a 'well-known' customer. Both the MVIS CEO and the head of the Hololens project (Alex Kipman) have awkwardly danced around the subject whenever they're asked about it so it's obvious there are NDAs.

However, it doesn't mean MVIS is directly contracted with MSFT. It could be a contract with a manufacturer (STM or Micron, as they also manufacture parts for the HL2) who then contracts with MSFT. Not sure that really makes a difference? It's definitely not for automotive LiDAR, though.

I've also been considering a straddle play around this earnings call. I'm not sure what investors are expecting after this morning's announcement. I highly doubt a buyout will be announced today or tomorrow and they already dropped the PR everyone was waiting for. I could see it dropping if nothing big happens.

So revenue's exist and seem to be a better play on the upcoming sector if you want to play tourism. I am invested in them and used to be in VG up until late last year.

So if SpaceX and other orbital launch companies continue to evolve at their current pace I wouldn't bet on VG being a profitable investment or venture at this point.

1632,CF," With regard to phosphogypsum, there are a few important things to understand:

1). The bulk of the $600M settlement wasn’t a fine.  It was funding set aside to pay for the future clean-up of these sites.  So some of the liability is priced in.

2). Only phosphogypsum in central Florida’s Bone Valley is radioactive.  Elsewhere, the gypsum by-product can be used but it is of minimal value.

3). The real problem isn’t the solid material, it’s the entrained water.  The gyp is mostly water and as it settles/dries, it leaches out acidic water with high nutrient and metal concentrations for decades.  This is in addition to any water that was on top of the stack when it closed.

Mosaic purchased the Plant City site from CF Industries about 3 years ago.  It was never profitable and was shut down about a year after purchase.  Mosaic of course now is responsible for closure.  That’s part of why I say Nutrien is better managed.  Mosaic has been left holding numerous bags.

In any case, in the near term (less than 3 years) I don’t see much changing with the stacks because there are multiple technical and regulatory challenges.

As for fertilizer prices rising.  It’s complicated.  Prices used to be controlled by the major phosphate producing countries similar to OPEC.  Russia decided to go alone and tanked prices maybe 7-8 years ago.  I don’t have a feel for the global capacity and all of the moving parts.  I do know that Nutrien in Canada got out of the phosphate business about 2 years ago so between the Redwater and Plant City plants; production capacity in the North America has been reduced.",AlpineAspirations,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n020im/mosiac_company_mos/gw4sudz/,0.041,0.894,0.064,0.6695

I don’t understand what’s going on with the P/E for Nutrien but my experience working with them at their Redwater (Alberta), White Springs (Florida) and Aurora (North Carolina) sites was all pretty positive.  I was never impressed with Mosaic’s management in FL or LA but you have to keep in mind that I work on the environmental side of the business so what I do is always a cost center.  Mosaic is run quarter to quarter and I see a lot of deferred costs adding up.  That’s why I’m not a big fan of their phosphate operations in FL and LA.  That said, many investors are looking quarter to quarter or in the case of WSB, day by day.

1647,RH," I mean this with all due respect, seriously. Just trying to be educational. 

You have a fundamental misconception of the “market value” of your options. The “bid” is the highest current price someone is willing to buy that contract at. The “ask” is the lowest price someone is willing to sell that contract. The “mark” (what you see as the price of the option on your platform) is the midpoint where buyers and sellers need to meet to make a deal. The difference between the two is the spread. Blue chip stocks have a very narrow spread typically. Super volatile stocks usually have wider spreads. 

The way to think of this is if you wanted to guarantee a sell of that option RIGHT NOW, you’d have to sell at the bid price. If you wanted to buy RIGHT NOW, you’d have to buy at the ask price.

If you trade options on a highly volatile stock you face 2 issues: First - the spreads are going to be wide so what you think of as your “profit” really isn’t your profit (because the spread is so wide), and second: with the stock being so volatile, your chances of getting filled at a limit order is much much lower. 

Let’s say there are 10 people with 1 contract each and they all have a limit order at $3. Let’s also say your are the 10th person in that queue. As the VERY VOLATILE stock drops significantly there are only 9 people willing to buy at that price. Everyone gets filled except you.

This also happens with limit orders when stocks gap up or down. The thing is stocks are MUCH more liquid than options, so getting skipped happens less often.

1652,RH," Right, I'm not really trying to blame RH, this was more of a first-hand cautionary tale of exactly what you described. My only complaint is that the bid price was over $4.xx for a while, and my take profit was set to $3.80, with my stop loss at $3.00 (with a cost of $2.80 each). Sadly I made the mistake of not watching my position closely and came back to a big loss. If the bid-ask only went above my take profit for a few seconds or minutes, of course it isn't likely to fill, but there was a pretty decent amount of trading done above my limit. Of course, as you said, volatility and liquidity are likely why my order did not fill, it just sucks that the price I was trying to sell at was essentially giving the bidders a discount in that moment, but no one wanted it.

Many things were wrong with this trade, and I know how risky it was, but I wanted to turn a quick profit and to an extent my plan worked out, there was profit to be made on my trade. But this was a good lesson that ""profit to be made"" is worthless if you can't exit your position.
