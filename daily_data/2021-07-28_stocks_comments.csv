9,AMD," It depends at whats the evaluation it is right now. Lets say that the stock has been going up like crazy since last earnings for no particular reason, does the price right now equals the evaluations from this earnings? If no, then it will drop. If yes. It will stay neutral. If something out of ordinary surpases a statistic and analyst was not expecting it, then it will jump up a lot.

In the case of Apple, the stock has gone up like crazy since last month from $125 to $149, if the stock has been around the $125-$135 like last earning, there will be a huge jump today and increase in the following days. Dont worry if you own Apple, it tends to go up after the sligh drop in earnings. A drop of 1.5% is nothing for Apple.

Microsoft also beats earnings, it stayed neutral. I expected a pull back similar to Apple due to the stock being already very high since last earning and a pull back similar to last earnings but I guess the hype of Asure server side wont make the stock drop.

Hasbro went up almost 10% yesterday due to Magic the gathering being more successfull than expected.

AMD stock has been neutral for almost the entire year, it was expected it to go up eventually and the earnings proved that the company was solid so its up right now 6% (it might drop during the day). Even with the supression of the merger and what not.

Evaluation also depends on which sector it is, even though Apple is in the tech side of things, its more like Microsoft than Google or Amazon. Even though they are both tech, they are value differently.",zethras,4,/r/stocks/comments/otaax4/why_do_the_price_of_stocks_drop_when_the_company/h6ufz6l/,0.055,0.87,0.075,0.7053
10,AAPL," It has to do with expectations from investors and forward looking guidance from the company  AAPL for example was trading at a 35 PE ratio. Historically AAPL lives below 18. So investors were presumably expecting an even bigger earnings beat. And they gave some forward looking guidance that this year over year growth was going to slow, maybe even stall from the semi shortage.

11,IMO," IMO the greater the price to book ratio disparity, the greater the fall in share price when ""buy the hype, sell the news"".  Ultimately share price is founded on the fundamentals, and so they have to support the share price.

Lately earnings have been the buying in the lead up, and then a sell off on the news, followed by a bit of a recovery, or.recovery over time.

13,NVDA," Take Apple for example. It had amazing earnings beating expectations by roughly 30% but it went down. Why? well, it's quite simple, everyone that matters already knew they would beat. Retail investors r the runts of the litter. Apple had already moved higher and higher before earnings (considered the earnings run-up) since Wall Street simply knows more than the rest of us.

In cases involving other tech giants such as NVDA it may not be so clear since NVDA has had a high run-up before earnings and after also beating preavious earnings they continued to rocket even higher.

Has anyone else seen FINRA is investigating CEO Vlad Tenev as not being licensed? Also, that $70MM fine HOOD had to in June? How about the fact HOOD wants to “Tackle Cr¥pto Volatility by Overriding Some Trades”?

  
This IPO is more of a pump and dump than the €r¥pto market has been in the past week (forever) and will fall harder than the Chinese markets have. At the very best, people should be shorting this IPO, but I simply wouldn’t touch it.

  
Research people, research.  


PFOF will allow Hedge Funds to destroy the retail investor, no matter which way they go on this IPO. Retail goes long, hedge funds go short and take their money when HOOD goes under; retail shorts it, HF goes long and takes makes money on retail covering their losses, then shorts HOOD into the ground.

Furthermore, OP, I strongly feel you're misinformed about the Robinhood situation. Not one person who is invested in these meme stocks sees a long future at Robinhood. The social sentement tells me they are going to get shorted into oblivion until it comes true. Also fact check me with the stats of how many transferred out of Robinhood in the last year after what happened with GME. To add, finding out that CEO Isn't even FINRA licenced is not going to help their cause.

45,SR,"  Fundamentals don't apply here. Fundamentals would have stopped shorting two companies the moment they were in the green for business. Fundamentals would say ok 80-90% of this stock is not outstanding so the price should reflect that. 

Tell me how it's possible for institutions to hold short positions in a company for an extended period of time while hitting the FTD dates and reshorting stocks, routing trade volume through the Darkpool and ignoring its own rules on the Darkpool for volume all while saying the business is flawed in both cases, yet GME carries no debt and AMC had bankruptcy off the table. Tell me please.

But it is hard to have earnings good enough to justify the kind of growth it has had. Thus, the AH drop. But don't get me wrong, long term Apple is a juggernaut.

80,MSFT," > I see this trend no matter of good performance or bad performance

It might look like that but sometimes there is more to the story when you peel back the layers.    Share price is about the future and NOT the results that just happened.  So it can have a really big factor on share price as it is forward looking.

So say there is killer results and the company gives weak guidance.  Well that is going to cause a decline.

Or say there is some killer numbers but something in the numbers is not good for the future.

Take MSFT for example.  They had some pretty incredible numbers but in those numbers was a 3% decline in Windows OEMs.  When you look at that and then also that Windows sales share will decline below 75% for the first time in 2021 it makes some to pause.

That is while Azure continues to just kill it.

102,WW," ""Big Debt Crises"" is one of the best treatises on the topic of Deleveraging, Monetary Policy and political interventionsm, and how the politicians often get it ""wrong"" in hindsight as well as the mania / euphoria unfolding just before deleveraging.

Current scenario looks very much like it rhymes with an inflationary one (let's not get hyperbolic with adding the word ""hyper"" just yet), but parts of current monetary developments will also match to deflationary (Bank of Japan, Lost Decade) scenario right before it unfolded back then. 

Since however Fed and ECB are creating massive amount of Book Money by QE, no single route can currently be forseen and the actual monetary policy with massive QE is not comparable 1:1 to any historical event, not 70's not WW II (since we're not at war), not Japan 1987 run-up in stock markets, then the unfolding / bubble burst and following 1991-2001 the Lost Decade happening .",BestGermanEver,2,/r/stocks/comments/ot22sk/ray_dalio_principles_of_navigating_big_debt/h6tvmu7/,0.064,0.866,0.07,0.0101

163,AMD," Maybe this will make you feel better. Was its really that bad to sell at 94$ ? Its up 30% since mid May. You sold after a run up and sold specifically on a big green day. Lets say AMD goest to 96$ but stays there for the next year. Your sold position might now be used to get into another position a get a better return  then if you stayed with AMD for the next 3 months.

202,BABA," cathie woods has lately been selling many stocks at their lows after accumulating at their highs (REGN being one of them)

she's a one trick pony, and many new investors got tricked into thinking since ETFs are considered safe, why not buy it as a long term hold

one minor detail they missed was the whole passive vs active investing thing

also the amount of pump and dump stocks ARK was invested in

there is a reason why she picked low float stocks, and pumped it by releasing her daily buys, so followers could jump in and by the same shares

unfortunately that only works when you are considered a messiah

these reddit threads used to be full of praise for her, and now its straight up insults towards her which I find funny

just shows her days are over

as for me, I bought 0 ARK

but I bought hella lot of BABA yesterday, and I am sure hedge funds were loading up as well (we will find out in next quarters 13-fs)

another case of dumb money loses money

250,ETH," I wrote explicitly in reference to their application as money/currency. That block chain technology has potential is, albeit intertwined with its function as currency, a different discussion.

And yet you did not provide an answer to my primary objection to how cryptocurrency, e.g. ETH since you brought it up, has inherent value as a mode of payment if we do not accept its value as a function of currency. Without dollar, currency, demand for ETH it will not have a discernable value.

Add to this the inherent price stability issues with many, including BTC and ETH, cryptocurrencies that make them impractical to useless as a method of payment. BTC has increased by 6-8k USD per BTC in the last week or so to high 30's and slumped similarly the week before, I assume similar movements by ETH, which makes them useless as a method of payment.

Which again relates to cryptocurrency not having inherent value and their speculative nature, lack of price stability, make the rationale for investment as opposed to consumption.

You transfer wealth to crypto to speculate, invest, not unlike other investment opportunities. That is the status of crypto today and the scope of the post you replied to.

Since you favour the crypto revolution. What happens to ETH and BTC if the US government tonight ban the use of the US financial and banking system to transfer wealth from and to banks to crypto marketplaces etc? Add that the US will sanction banks, clearinghouses, middlemen etc. if they provide services to get around regulations.

269,ATVI," ATVI: Down ~7% yesterday and trading in the low $80s compared to my $116 price target. The stock went down in response primarily due to the State of California filing a lawsuit against ATVI, especially the Blizzard unit, for having a discriminatory workplace and a strong minority of current & former employees signing a letter condemning ATVI leadership, organizing a protest today, etc. The major risks I see is that this will be a short-term distraction for current employees to develop content & games (minor delays), some long-term risk to recruit talent, and minor churn from gamers with values that strongly goes against what happened or may still happen to ATVI. My research suggests the 28% discount is unwarranted since engagement for the games are still strong (went on Twitch yesterday and viewership is still consistent, especially CoD which is generally #2 after GTA. That implies most gamers are still going to embrace the games) and ATVI leadership are actively working on the issue to ensure an inclusive work environment. In my view, this is a short-term distraction for employees that will go away and customer engagement is strong as ever.",ricke813,1,/r/stocks/comments/ot1tcl/undervalued_stock_suggestions/h6ta810/,0.074,0.78,0.147,0.946

But seriously man, are we really talking about valuations….. how many public companies listed as of today aren’t making a profit…..last time I checked the market doesn’t give a fuck what the valuations are, I believe in AMD and my opinion is it is undervalued, and will continue to climb as people move away from intel seeing as AMD again is taking market share from them and simply cannot keep up when it comes to the advancements of their chips. If you’re worried about high valuations, there a loooooooot of companies out there you won’t be buying.

293,AMD," In the short term stocks can diverge from earnings... but in the long term they always realign and you know how the saying goes, the most dangerous phrase in investing is ""this time will be different"". 

And if valuation doesn't matter, how can a company ever be undervalued? If AMD was trading at 200$ per share you would still call it undervalued because the fundamentals dont matter and you think even though you are overpaying for it there will be an even bigger loser later on you can dump it on for a profit. So you are just trading sentiment basically. But like I said AMD is already the favorite, noone is investing in Intel right now and the few who are arent doing it for their semiconductor business but the new stuff, so I doubt AMD will get a drove of new investors from Intel that way. 

If they do you can trust I am buying Intel though because the returns just from the dividends and buybacks would be insane. 

And yes there are a lot of companies I am not buying, why would pay 40x earnings when my returns will be dismal If I am a long term investor?

294,AMD," I agree with a lot of what you say. How do you feel about Tesla? Because they are trading at such a high eps do you think there is no long term growth there? I agree with what you’re saying but I just don’t see intel getting back into favor anytime soon with AMD widening the gap in their chips, and as the years go by I think AMD will continue to rise as intel struggles.  I could be totally wrong but that’s just what I see. I like Lisa Su, I’m a believer in her and I think she’s done an amazing job and will continue to do an amazing job. So in that regard, over the next five years I see AMD as being undervalued right now. Who knows intel could turn it around tomorrow, or they could end up never turning it around, I don’t personally think that but for the next five years I see AMD gaining even more market share.  Ask me again in 5 years, my answer could be completely different then.  But for now I see AMD as undervalued if I’m looking 5 years out.  I know sentiment isn’t everything, but technicals aren’t everything either.  My investing style has been working pretty good for me over the past 10 years, but then again, who hasn’t lol. I just try stick to stuff I know at least somewhat about.  But as for the OPs original question, personally I see AMD as undervalued right now if I’m looking out 5 years.  Again just my two cents lol",Mr_Pete_Diamond,1,/r/stocks/comments/ot1tcl/undervalued_stock_suggestions/h6un93w/,0.034,0.794,0.172,0.9905
295,AMD," Yeah with Tesla I bet they will reach a new ATH and they are a great company who I think will only grow larger over the coming years, but all that is priced in to the valuation already so I dont see much growth potential in the long term unless the price comes down, which I think and hope it will sometime not too long from now. 

But to be clear, I am not saying AMD is not undervalued based on its fundamentals. A rich P/E ratio can be justified if you expect a high continued growth rate. I am interested in both AMD and Intel so I wanted to hear what your thesis was. But AMD is richly priced so again if it fails to deliver on that growth there is not a small downward potential. I like a large margin of Safety in my investments because I know usually I wont be able to predict the future with 100% certainty. 

As for Intel people arent really investing due to their semiconductor business, but the new ventures they are creating. Even if they can just offsett the lost revenue from the semiconductor industry with their new ventures that would mean an upside of 100% in the coming 5 years. 

So both companies could be worth investing in but for different reasons, in my opinion.",ZealousZushi,2,/r/stocks/comments/ot1tcl/undervalued_stock_suggestions/h6ux4dj/,0.061,0.766,0.174,0.9797

Stock markets are seen as risky and unsafe in most developing countries. North America and EU to some extent has a track record of steadily growing and stable stock market that extends for decades. This gives the population a lot of trust since the market has been so good for so long. In developing countries the stock market is relatively new and still has to win over the populations trust and this takes time. On top of that there is no cultural knowledge or large scale infrastructure encouraging people to invest in the stock market. In North America its common to invest in the stock market through your employer, pension, 401K or TFSA. There are a lot of nudges in society that push people to the stock market.

I don't assume that. Learning about investing may or may not make you perform better than the market. But I sure as hell know that someone won't beat the market if their entire experience is one reddit post.

This is all interesting, and something I'm aware of. However, it's not quite analogous to what an individual (like me) is doing. 

I have several important advantages that a pension fund does not have. 

1) Size. It makes intuitive sense that the more size you have, the harder it is to generate significant returns. Law of large numbers and all. Let's say Warren Buffett really likes this company and thinks it's worth 3x what it costs. Well if the company is worth $500mm there's not much he can do with it. And the little he can do with it is not worth his time. But if you're dealing with $250k in capital the story is different. **This is the biggest advantage. I don't need my strategy to work for $50 billion. I need it to work for <$1mm**

2) Incentives/mandates. Pension fund managers have strict mandates and incentives. I have none of that. I could do nothing all year and not have to worry about people thinking I'm slacking off and not doing my job. I don't have any ""assumed rate of return"". No one's gonna fire me or force me to sell off my positions if I'm down 10% for the year. That freedom means I can do things the Buffett way - hold few and hold long. 

3) Concentrated positions. I can dump all my money into one stock and no one could tell me otherwise. In fact, up until recently that was sorta true. I took a job at a software company 4 years ago and received RSUs. I took the job in big part because I thought there was a ton of potential, and in that time the stock has 10-15x'd, and up until recently those RSUs made up a giant chunk of my networth. I'm already far past where I would be if I had been earning market returns on those. 

So, ultimately I do believe it's very possible to beat the market. Having small size, concentrated positions and unwavering emotions are key. Not everyone can/will do it, but it's possible.",LambdaLambo,1,/r/stocks/comments/otcucc/how_to_choose_midlong_term_stocks/h6vjfpx/,0.045,0.802,0.153,0.9953
351,DTE," From first glance everything looks correct. So why would you use a butterfly?

It's mainly a return on capital (ROC) that changes quite a bit. Personally, I don't like butterfly's unless I'm legging into them (converting a put ratio spread to make a free butterfly). But the two situations that you describe for profitability have very different ROC.

To own 200 shares even on regular margin requires $2,200 ($4,400 without). So selling Covered calls for $0.86 is a ROC of 3.9% in a margin account or about 1.95% in a non-margin account. 

The butterfly at max profit is a ROC of 284.6%.

Now, holding a butterfly to expiration just doesn't happen. You're dealing with so much gamma risk near the end that it's just never worth doing. But if a stock waffles back and forth past the $22 strike and you opened the position at 45 DTE, then when it crosses $22 again with 25DTE there's a good chance that theta has eaten away enough of the position that you can close at maybe 30% max profit. 

30% max profit on a position like this is still an 85.4% ROC. That's a huge return.

Butterfly's have very narrow ranges of profitability so it's probably never going to stay in it's range the entire time. But it's a low risk play with a high reward. 

That's why that trade-off exists. High returns can't also be high probability",OptionsExplained,3,/r/stocks/comments/otbjqn/confused_at_butterfly_spreads_and_why_someone/h6u6pro/,0.065,0.781,0.153,0.9765
352,DTE," Ah makes a little more sense, thanks for writing out all this. So is the benefit essentially that you don't have to actually own the shares in the beginning to execute? I assume you still need to have the cash or in this case $4,400 to safely be prepared if they do get exercised is that right? Might be dumb question, what does DTE stand for, I probably know what it is, but simply not the acronym for it? 

So I assume essentially the difference between butterflies and simply selling options is that it requires less capital to start, although ultimately the same amount of capital to execute is that right to say? In other words, for the example given, unlike typical selling calls, you don't have to spend $4,400 on the spot to buy the shares to execute, but you simply have to have that amount ready if you do, assuming you're going for the covered strategy and want to play safe, by avoiding margins and naked moves?",LifeInAction,1,/r/stocks/comments/otbjqn/confused_at_butterfly_spreads_and_why_someone/h6u8nys/,0.029,0.837,0.135,0.9468
353,DTE," DTE is short for ""Days to Expiration""

From the way you're prompting the question, I'm guessing you're mainly looking at things from an ""at expiration"" point of view. Most option traders don't want to own the underlying, we tend to close out the position early when we're profitable. 

For example. I sold a 41/41 straddle on FXI. This means I sold a put at 41 and a call at 41. I did that when IV Rank (IVR) was about 120. Even with just one day passing and IV dropping that position has made about 20% which was enough for me to close it. Straddles are effectively always in the money since they share the same strike. I don't want to take it to expiration because I don't really want to own the shares, I just know that IV usually regressed back to the mean and theta decays the position.

Strategies like a butterfly you have to look through a slightly different lens than what it will do when it expires.",OptionsExplained,2,/r/stocks/comments/otbjqn/confused_at_butterfly_spreads_and_why_someone/h6ubqy2/,0.046,0.879,0.075,0.7804
354,PLTR," I think you're getting it. For that spread, I paid $0.26 to open it. If the stock stays exactly over my strike (just to make this easier to understand), then over time my option, the cost to ""sell to close"" my position will actually go up all else being equal. So if I can now sell my 4 options back for $0.35 then I'll make a profit of $0.09 or $9 total. I could have 10 of those spreads on and make a 35% return.

Someone doing that trade probably wants to collect 15% of the $0.74, maybe even less. That's way too risky a position for me to ever use so someone else would have to chime in on what they want.

Butterfly's are definitely not the vehicle to be learning this on, there's too many legs to keep track of. 

Any time we buy an option (pay a debit for it) we want the option to increase in value so that we can resell it for more than we bought it (just like stocks). Let's look at PLTR and buy the Sept 21 Call at 24. Right now it would cost $1.19. If tomorrow PLTR moves up to $25 then my calls are going to be worth closer to $2.40. This means if I sell them I can make $1.21 (2.40-1.19) because they are now more valuable. 

If I exercised now I would actually lose money even though my position is ITM. That's because I paid $1.19, and my calls give me the right to buy at $24 so my breakeven is $25.19. 

I just lost $0.19.

But you can see that selling my position made me the $1.21, basically a 100% return. All with no shares changing hands.",OptionsExplained,2,/r/stocks/comments/otbjqn/confused_at_butterfly_spreads_and_why_someone/h6uklm9/,0.031,0.9,0.069,0.7796

383,BODY, Don’t buy options unless your betting on a catalyst. Personally I would not buy calls on BODY - peloton was the ultimate stay at home play that’s likely to see heavy selling pressure in the upcoming year as investors rotate into more cyclicals.,dougieknowsall,3,/r/stocks/comments/ot9eya/1000_stocks_vs_10_option_leap_contracts/h6tveud/,0.052,0.892,0.056,0.0516
384,UK, Depends on what you trade. I used to do £100k position size in UK microcap. It was impossible to trade. You would move the shares. You wouldn't find any shares half the time. Basically you needed a proper broker to work the order in the market. If your doing purely doing US large cap... then to be honest the skies the limit. You can execute almost anything near instantly and with low cost.,Mortal1ty1337,1,/r/stocks/comments/ot0hwr/at_what_portfolio_size_does_one_consider_as/h6tw7dw/,0.027,0.872,0.1,0.6808
385,AMD," From my experience, the worst thing you can do is touch your portfolio. The best investors are dead investors. In the past I've sold positions that I thought were trash, AMD, bitcorn, GME. I would be living in a penthouse if I hadn't. My new strategy is to buy relatively small positions and let them just decay if they don't work. So crap stocks like those from the crazy lady are all decaying, but as the positions are small I don't care too much. I've so many small positions that it's impractical even to sell them on a bad day, so I don't. I've a few that do extremely well and these make up for everything else.

That said, I would at least reduce the position from that media celebrity snake oil charlatan billionaire to something you are comfortable losing. If it does work out in the end like other scams such as bitcorn, which he also heavily promotes btw, then you have at least still some left. I also would reduce weed stocks, it sounds more futuristic than it is IMO.

Also study at least some parameters such as market cap and others on finviz. And don't trust the news, youtube, it's all fake, they want your money. Reddit to some extent can be an inspiration, but it too is lagging rather than predictive IMO.",biologischeavocado,1,/r/stocks/comments/otfeon/keep_my_picks_or_start_over/h6vmbf6/,0.146,0.752,0.102,-0.9048
