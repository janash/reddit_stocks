0,IMO," I think what the OP intent to say is that a prolonged bear market isn’t likely to happen soon - as for market crash, by definition we’ve already had one last feb-march where S&P dropped about ~30%. 

Are corrections/pull backs/retrace or whatever you wana call them going to happen? Absolutely yes & likely on a monthly basis (to various degrees). Are we going to suddenly experience another ~25-30% crash in S&P? For that to happen it needs some sort of catastrophic event (which let’s all pray won’t happen), rather than just fear of overvaluation. 

Are we going to suddenly enter a bear market of prolonged declining asset prices across the board? My guess would be is even less likely due 

a) unprecedented fiscal support and QE programs that most central banks across developed economies have committed

b) record high level of average household savings and pent up demand for consumption due to COVID

c) many business sectors (whether is tech, airlines or energy) have learned to become more efficient and leaner during the pandemic, which will likely result in an increased productivity rate and more effective use of their capital - two factors critical for future growth. 

d) lastly, crashes and bear markets are likely to happen when everyone is LEAST expecting them. With the Covid crash and even 08 crisis still fresh in the minds of many investors, you can see that we’ve already experienced multiple sell offs due to valuation concerns, I think this is a sign that many participants are fearful of an overheated market, which ironically isn’t a typical sign of an imminent crash. 

There are many more reasons I can think of that will support the thesis for a prolonged bull market rather than a bear one. Note this does not mean we go straight up to the moon, but IMO a gradual uptrend in the next 3-5 years is much more likely than a gradual down trend.",Environmental_Yam_57,413,/r/stocks/comments/ltf3iq/i_am_bullish_about_the_future/goxzsmg/,0.059,0.874,0.067,0.1489
1,DD," I love the DD, but you’re missing some big pictures things. Housing prices and health care costs are at unsustainable levels.

Something’s gotta give. Look at all the index charts and you see a pattern, spikes since 2017, small Covid drop, even bigger spikes since.

2,NDAQ," 1) The Nasdaq100 PE is not 22.74, thats NDAQ the company. The Nasdaq100 pe is 38.5

2) The market is is filled with Chinese scam companies and dead businesses that earn no money. This is not healthy.

3) Tons of new investors joining typically signals the end of a bull market

4) Margin/leverage usage is at record levels (options now control the market, usually its the other way around)

5)The Fed thinks it has control. It doesnt. The Fed always believes it can save the market/economy but its always hubris.

6) The actual economy certainly isnt better off than a year ago, its actually taken a big hit, yet the stock market keeps melting up.

3,GME," But! But!!! People on the internet is extremely bullism and Warren Buffet said be scared when others are greedy. Surely a crash is coming!! /s

I agree. We had the same narrative on November before the rally, before that in September, before that in March, etc. Tesla, a huge ass company with huge ass potential for growth being overvalued is not the same as a .com company in a garage that sells nothing and basically has no idea what they will in the future.

Plus, I am sure that whenever the next crash does come, it will either be due to events we can't foresee (like Covid, or a war) or that we have no idea about. Retail is a lot smarter than we are given credit for but if GME has shown us anything, is that we are at a massive disadvantage when it comes to access to information.

Edit: I am an environmental professional (engineer+economist). The next *real* crash (and possibly war) will come due to climate change induced problems and resource shortages, and that's definitely within our lifetimes but definitely not in the next few months/years. Probably will start to see serious effects in the 2030s, but it's anyone's guess (yes, that's actually a professional opinion :D )",filmmakerwannabe92,7,/r/stocks/comments/ltf3iq/i_am_bullish_about_the_future/goyo66h/,0.127,0.757,0.116,0.4248

6,GDP," Totally disagree. The only reason our current market is valued this high is because of exceedingly low interest rates and a massive amount of fiscal stimulus. How we know valuations make no sense?

1. The current S&P500 PE ratio is 40x. Historical average is 15x. That means a normalized PE ratio would yield a 62% market drop. 

2. Market Cap:GDP. Historical average is 80%. Current ratio is 195%. Returning to average of 80% GDP would yield a 59% correction. 

3. Half of all market gains in past 120 years have come from dividends. Average dividend of S&P500 is 4%. Current divided is 1.53%. To get back to a dividend yield on S&P500 of 4% we would need S&P500 to be 1450 or a 63% drop. 

But wait don't low interest rates justify such valuations? Why then are most other developed and emerging markets have much more attractive price to earnings?

I mean seriously how can we continue to have 2% GDP growth, with 6% earnings growth, and 9% market growth? Sure the market can stay irrational for a long time but eventually prices will revert back to the mean and my guess is that will happen when interest rates rise.",BJJblue34,3,/r/stocks/comments/ltf3iq/i_am_bullish_about_the_future/goyocdj/,0.061,0.834,0.104,0.8738

9,AAPL," You're missing an important point. The stock market is a human invention, it's not a process taken from nature. The only _natural_ law the market is based on is supply and demand, and even that's debatable as a natural laws vs a psychological law. 

Everything else that happens on the market is bound by the laws of _human psychology_. Humans are greedy, they want to make money. If the market becomes insolvent, nobody can make money. So at the end of the day, even the bears want stocks to go back up. 

Because of this, stocks will always go up, and almost always higher than before they dipped. 

When you get a bond driven selloff like the one we have now, buy low and wait it out. The stocks will recover on their own, and when bonds mature and people start coming back to the market, demand will drive it up further. 

So take advantage of the yard sale and go long. A $100 10 year bond will absolutely be worth $100 in 10 years. But a $120 AAPL share will _probably_ be worth $200+ by then.",IHaveGiantBaseballs,3,/r/stocks/comments/ltf3iq/i_am_bullish_about_the_future/gp0nvgd/,0.049,0.843,0.108,0.8568

11,CSCO," Granted I am very hungover today but I think you might not have all the facts about what kicked off the Dot Com crash.

But much like Tesla, Cisco’s insane valuations were based on wild projections about future growth that, in retrospect, was based on pretty flimsy reasoning. Then one day CSCO missed analyst projections, which shook confidence and became part of a cascade of other factors that took everything down. 

There’s also companies like SNOW, which, yes, do make a profit but in no way justify their huge valuations. Let’s also not forget the SPAC market. MANY of these companies make no product or profit and some are purely speculative plays. You also have huge froth in penny stocks/OTC stocks and rampant crypto speculation, with a ton of new and inexperienced money pouring into both.

Usually new investors trying to make a quick buck and say things like “we’re in a new paradigm” and “the boomers are just jealous of our gains.” They thought so in 1999 too...

Now I’m fine with trying to make a quick buck, I speculate too.

Hence, you argue: a new crash ""should not"" happen, because we had this massive pre-2000 (ca. 1980-2000) Bull Run that lead to exaggerated and inflated market valuations in a large time frame and we should just compare the past with the future.

Because you, the average and newly minted Investor Joe, will use the stimulus check to YOLO it into the ""stock market"" instead of buying some new dentals for your gramps or a new doggie bath for your poodle etc. pp.

\- Further, since we saw what happened with ""GME"", notwithstanding facts like the initial overload in short interest that spiked stock prices initially to the crazy zone. The takeaway here is: ""more people to join in the neverending bull run"" is good. At least, you state, it ""obviously isn't bad"".

I just wonder what will happen if there is a c-word crash. To me, it's very similar to the .com bubble. You could argue for BC or whatever, even some of the top ones, but there are tons out there that are worth $100mil - $multiple billions that barely do anything or make any money. Most are centered around security and contracts or whatever, but how many can really be profitable if there are 100 to choose from in that niche of DeFi?

If that $1.5+ trillion dollars goes back into stocks, that would be nice, but also if losses are big enough, some might have to sell their stocks, so I can't tell how bad a big c-word crash would be in relation to the market. 2018's crash didn't have a big enough market cap with big enough players for it really to bleed out much.

If a sizeable percentage of companies have c-word investments in place of bonds and there was a crash in c-words, I could see that crashing the stock market too, ofc we could be talking 2030 by the time enough companies have a sizeable amount on their balance sheets.",brucekeller,1,/r/stocks/comments/ltf3iq/i_am_bullish_about_the_future/goz2q0g/,0.085,0.826,0.089,0.2126

I own GME and i fully expect that when the squeeze happens it can very likely crash the economy. Maybe it doesn't.

Covid was spreading like a wild fire through European countries and market was still going up. That crash was so foreseeable. This thread just shows short memory people have. News sites and investing subs were stressing about Covid before market did. Hell pre-crash ATH SPY most companies were preparing for remote work because it was clear things were about to change (at least in transport companies).

38,IMO," Housing prices (or health care costs) being high is more bullish than bearish IMO. We have a bunch of young adults (20-35) now, who are coming into the market now, due to the spread of easy access retail brokerages. They are less rich than their parents (or grandparents) were at the same age, even if they did all the things the system tells you to do (go to college, get a job, etc.). They can't afford homes and have access to the market. What do you think people are going to put their money to? A bank savings account that doesn't even cover inflation? Bonds that pay \~1-2% a year? Or stocks (or even ETFs) that at least have the potential to grow their wealth, instead of just (barely) preserve it. (and the same thing is happening in Europe, and at least part of that money is coming into the US stock market too). 

Look at what happened with stimulus checks. It wasn't even a lot of money but a very big chunk of people went and put it into the market. Young adults are going to continue to pour their money into the market exactly because if they actually want a chance to improve their financial standing and for example be able to afford a house, there is literally nowhere else to put it.",filmmakerwannabe92,2,/r/stocks/comments/ltf3iq/i_am_bullish_about_the_future/goys11p/,0.005,0.921,0.073,0.9252

46,DD," I literally haven't read one piece of DD that actually makes a good case for an actual crash. There is only ever the very same proverbs, not followed by actual evidence. (also, they only ever come when the market is down for a couple of days and then disappear as soon as it comes back up).

We have a ton of reasons why the market won't **crash** anytime soon and have the set up for a continued bull run. 

* You have bears always saying there is a bubble, shilling about tesla and what not. OP might have taken the wrong PE, but what he says it's true. The market is overvalued but not as overvalued as some people like to scream about. (Some companies are obviously are, but the market as a whole)
* Interest rates are going to stay low until at least 2023. A lot can happen until then. 
* A new round of stimulus is coming
* The is literally nowhere else to put your money. Bank savings accounts, bonds, etc. are not an option anymore. Money will continue to pour into the market. 
* Covid ending is going to have a lot of companies bounce back strong as long as they can survive. Some stuff will never be the same, but after sitting at home for 1.5 years, I think we all can agree that everyone is ready to travel, go out, spend money, etc. 
* Covid has changed a lot of things for good. One main thing being: a lot of (white collar) companies have realized that they can have the majority of their workforce working from home at least most of the time, and won't go back to the 5 days a week 9-5 workweek in the office. People will be working a lot more from home, which means a)cutting costs for companies, meaning increased productivity on their money b)people spending their money (and changing their habits) differently. 

I do think there will be a real crash, and a big one in the relatively near future. But it will be because of climate change fucking us in every way possible (resource shortages, natural disasters, possibly wars, etc) and the problem will be a lot bigger than a market crash.",filmmakerwannabe92,1,/r/stocks/comments/ltf3iq/i_am_bullish_about_the_future/goyujz0/,0.086,0.829,0.085,0.1779

57,AAPL," I am bullish too. Here’s my thesis why we won’t see a crash. And frankly, ABH*. This saved me a lot of potential loss a year ago (late Feb 2020).

-The current evaluations are sustainable and not built on hope as the 2000 .com crash did. The Dow, S&P 500 and Russell 2k are loaded with real companies with real businesses and real growth/dividend potential that have moats, high floors and are mostly centered in the best economy in the world (USA). PEP, WMT, FB, AAPL, CAT, AMZN, JNJ, etc. are not going out of business. The .com bubble was frenetic and the market was treated like a casino at the time. Those “investors” got what they deserved.

-As eluded to earlier, the rest of the world will continue to invest in USA companies. Where else is money going to find “Safe Harbor”. Bonds are still too low, cash is about to be the worst investment as it will LOSE value against inflation.

-Boomers are going to still move their income to safe assets. Real estate is a potential location, but not many boomers want to deal with the work of real estate investments.

-ABH* = Always Be Hedging. Pigs get slaughtered as they say. Sell covered calls against your stocks and generate downside protection. If you’re really bearish, create collars. Regardless, my portfolio broke even this week because I am always in weekly covered calls.

-Institutional money needs a place to go. Do your junk those managers are selling everything and then going into bonds? I think not.

-USA economy is poised to enjoy a nice recovery when the pandemic is under control (Q32021 is my guess). The pandemic put out of business some companies that were going to fail anyway. Others companies found ways to become more efficient and bridge the pandemic gap. While others used the efficiency to make more revenue and profits and will prosper after this Covid thing is behind us.

-There is a massive geographic population shift going on IN THE USA. No one is fleeing the country, but moving to places where freedom is not a bad word. Meaning our GDP by state will change, but not in the USA. Once the shift is complete, this will settle the new normal.

-Growth companies (E.g. PLTR, CCL*, SQ, etc.) are viable and will continue to grow. Some will fail, but there are many that are based on sound ideas and are buttressed by really smart people, technology and market efficiency.

*I think CCL will take off once we are past the C-19 thing.

-The housing bubble in 2009 will not be recreated. Banks lended money to anyone with a pulse. That’s not happening anymore. I have an 820 credit score, more cash and securities x 5 than a refi I just completed in December. They underwriter put me through the ringer and I’m a “vanilla” loan risk. Through my personal experience, I know there is no way that the current national housing debt is in bubble territory. Just the opposite.

70,SP," For folks saying last week was a crash / correction. We barely lost 5% on the Nasdaq and SP was down about half that. That is not a correction. That’s normal course of selling. Correction is that 8-10% range and feels very likely to still come. 

There are a lot of reasons for a correction.

1) Interest rates rising is a legitimate concern and who knows where they really head from here
2) Inflation is going to come. Economics 101, M2 money supply goes up, inflation goes up. Passing another $1T bill is going to make this even more apparent. Possible that Interest rates may be signaling. 
3) Valuations are crazy. This one is a bit weaker because of all the QE/low rates/stimulus I’d expect crazy valuations comparative to history
4) Institutional money is sitting on enormous long term gains from March of last year that they are going to trim and rotate into different names over time. Plus end of quarter is typically rebalancing time and you see an uptick in volatility.

82,IP," Most of these companies were already struggling before the pandemic, with the current events just highlighting it even more. Macy's, for example, was facing serious solvency issues before covid, and was on track to declare bankruptcy in a few years. Covid obviously fast tracked that, but most of these weren't healthy before. Exxon Mobil is a company I'm actually bullish on, but was loaded to the gills with debt before all of this, and warranted concern from shareholders. And even if covid caused a lot of this, some of these companies are honestly just going to be hit too hard to ever recover. I would have to go digging for the source, but I believe health care is heavily represented on this list as well.

Some of these companies will recover. I'm not here to say that 700+ companies, some of them the most recognizable names in America, are all going to go under within the year. But this just highlights an issue that's really been going on since the last major Fed intervention in 2011. Bad companies allowed cheap credit are able to crawl along like a patient on life support. In addition to this list you have your near zombies, the companies that teeter on that fine line of profit. Even those that manage to resurrect themselves don't usually go on to be major economy drivers.

The issue I think is that these companies are already struggling, here today, with near zero interest. Some of the cyclicals will boost revenue post pandemic. Some won't. And when the Fed inevitably raises rates, perhaps not until 2023, but certainly at some point, what happens to all those companies already in zombie status or on the brink of?

Even assuming some of these companies survive, the overall toll on the economy is greater than the good they provide. $2 trillion in debt, and growing rapidly, with realistic uncertainty on how much of that gets repaid. Hundreds of billions, if not trillions of dollars tied up in assets like real estate, production, IP, etc, that could otherwise be used by profitable companies. Not to mention the talented professionals stuck working for these companies.

And when even just a few of them fail, the ripples will be far bigger than just their immediate market cap. Tens of thousands of jobs lost as companies cut expenses where they can. Loan defaults, on top of capital stuck in these companies. Billions of dollars lost by ETFs, retail investors, and institutional investors alike. Panic reactions from all of that spreading to the market as a whole.

These companies need to be allowed to fail, but the Fed won't allow it. In the long run, the assets and market space will be taken up by successful companies, and jobs regained from the same. But by keeping rates low, the Fed allows these companies to struggle along, which ultimately does the economy more harm than good. I think some companies will be able to turn it around, but I worry that even a reasonable uptick in rates is going to have at least short term negative effects in enormous magnitudes across the entire market, stemming in part from the dead weight of these companies.

Oh, thank you for the concern, but it wouldn't significantly change anything for me if that $1000 disappeared entirely; very sad, but in a 'I just had a bump-up in the parking lot and now my fender is fucked' kind of way, not a 'I was just t-boned by someone going 45mph' kind of way.

106,AAPL," Great question. I don't see the current valuation as anything being insane or illogical. I see it as logical.

If you think about Ben Graham's Intelligent Investor, you wouldn't presently find any stock that actually fit the ideal criteria of the stock that Graham describes. This proves that the market has fundamentally changed. That's because the market has moved to a point where DCF has become the prime way of finding bargain.

People look at lagging indicators and scream bubble when they don't realise we are still in a crisis situation which is hurting earnings. But the values of most stocks are still rooted to fundamentals if you do DCF and count their future earnings potential with a pinch of optimism. There are certain areas and companies which may be overvalued and is being filled with speculation, but the stock market overall is pretty fairly valued.

For example, AAPL and similar stocks suffered selloff because their present value of future earnings got decreased due to treasury yield spike. This points to a market that is actually functioning.

Sure, some SPACs and companies like Lemonade make little sense in their valuations, but they won't last long. Also, most SPAC investors just dump their SPACs before the merger is completed.

Using metrics like P/E, Buffet indicator etc won't work in the current market because for 1. earnings are down, P/E would be logically high and 2. US companies have globalised quite a bit from when these indicators were introduced plus the worldwide investment community uses the US stock market as a sort of hedge and primary investment destination, thus increasing the multiple for US stocks and 3. the revolution in free trading and such is finally helping attract younger investors who are more risk tolerant and have a long time ahead of them thus making equities more attractive compared to bonds.

You have to realise that, equities don't need to be cheap to be in a bull market, they just need to be the most attractive form of investment compared to any other form of investment. Liquidity is there. It will do the rest of the job.

And if you are still too worried about the valuation in our domestic stock market, I suggest you to take opportunities in foreign markets. No need to keep yourself stuck for any reason. Do remember though, our domestic market will always trade at a premium compared to foreign markets because of USD.

Plus, I think the opportunity cost of not being invested in the market is just too high compared to the risk.

206,BABA," (Reuters) - The Biden administration plans to allow a Trump-era rule targeting Chinese technology firms deemed to pose a threat to the United States to go into effect despite objections from U.S. businesses, the U.S. Commerce Department said on Friday.

The department issued an interim final rule in the final days of the Trump administration aimed at addressing information and communications technology supply chain concerns and said it would become effective after a 60-day period of public comment.

On Friday, a Commerce spokeswoman said in a statement the department would continue to accept public comment on the rule until March 22, when it would go into effect.

""Trustworthy information and communications technology and services are essential to our national and economic security and remains a top priority for the Biden Harris administration,"" the statement said.

My favorite line is ""jumping off a speeding train causes injuries.""   Once your allocation to equities has been trashed you need to keep invested in them as time will eventually heal all wounds.  Again if you have the time.   I entered both 2000 and 2008 fully invested in equities in my 401k.  But I had the time before retirement to let things play out.  At that time I was more interested in what I was doing at work than even thinking about the market.   But I had a good friend that had to be ""the Guy"" that defined the bottom.  He called his SB broker on March 9, 2009 and told him to go to all cash.

280,VC,"  

1. **ESG is dumb**. It's a repackaging of greenwashing or sustainable investing. It's a marketing gimmick used by financial services to sell retail a feel-good story. ESG should always be ***considered*** when conducting a financial analysis, but to buy a company just because it makes you feel good is the dumbest financial decision. For example, an oil company doesn't care if you sell their shares. By selling non-ESG stocks, the company doesn't lose money, and by buying ESG stocks those companies don't receive any money. The only way to fund ESG is direct investment through IPOs/2ndry offerings or debt/lending.
2. **Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (Acronyms) are scams**. Acronyms raise money which they must then spend at least 85% on an acquisition. If they use 10$ to buy 10$ worth of a company, then that 10$ should not be worth 50$ on the open market. If CertainTicker goes and buys CertainCompany for 10$, why should I buy CertainTicker for 30$??? SCAM. It's a viable way to raise capital and take a company public, but there is no way that Acronym sponsors are such good deal makers that they are able to find private companies that they can buy at <1% of their intrinsic value (if you buy 10$ for 50$ you are saying the Acronym is buying the target at 1/500 of the value, >99% discount).
3. **Valuations do matter**, but there is so much VC money and capital structures are so skewed/rigged that institutions are able to shovel the shit into retail's mouth at bloated prices. Eventually it will come crashing down, but not unless there is a broader market event.
4. **We need a market crash** to clean out the toxicity in the capital markets. I don't want pain anymore than you, but the system is too rigged and too propped up to be efficient in the long run. The market needs to fail in order to restore balance and faith in the long run. Millennials get blamed for the ""everyone wins"" mentality, but Boomers are the ones that created that system, and I see the current monetary policy and ""save the market"" mentality as a extremely similar. Let it fail.
5. **Oil is not going away.**

* Everything you use touches oil in some way or another, either directly or ancillary in the supply chain.
* Retail use of oil/petroleum is absolutely dwarfed by industrial use and the military industrial complex use. All military vehicles (ALL) run on diesel. That isn't changing until electric is stable and reliable.
* The most efficient way to heat large spaces is still by burning coal or natural gas. Industrial boilers run on burning things. Again, retail/residential heating might be able to be electric, but that electric also has to come from somewhere.
* Ships: the most efficient way to get things across the ocean is floating it on a boat. Those boats run on fossil fuels. Deal with it.",Capn-Stabn,5,/r/stocks/comments/ltqnrm/unpopular_stock_opinions_discussion_thread/gp1sg7g/,0.066,0.8,0.133,0.9888

287,FB," I’ve been buying FB here and there. Everyone hates it. People are worried about regulation and slowing user growth. I’m not a super FB bull but the reason I’m adding to my position is this-

Feels like we’re at a weird place where everyone’s wondering if there will be a rotation out of high growth/ tech into value. People are trying to figure out if they should get more aggressive buying “economic recovery” plays and how much is priced in. 
FB is trading at a discounted P/E and forward P/E to the S&P 500 for the first time in its history. (About 18x forward 21E) It’s still growing revenue  by 20% -25% a year and earnings by >10% a year. It obviously has a strong balance sheet.
There’s more to it but basically I feel like it’s a higher growth stock trading at a depressed multiple due to sentiment. I don’t think it’s “going to the moon!” any time soon but feels like a nice balance of still getting exposure to tech and growth with much less downside from higher rates / growth selloff due to valuation.",Verb0182,2,/r/stocks/comments/ltqnrm/unpopular_stock_opinions_discussion_thread/gp2csle/,0.079,0.735,0.187,0.9739
288,EV," Oil is going to be one of the best investments in the medium-term

Tesla and Palantir are significantly overvalued by all metrics and will continue to drop significantly.  Tesla is not even dominant anymore - competition is already here.

Did I say overvalued? - let’s not forget EVs, SPACs, green energy and weed stocks. 

EVs - people seem to think that every EV company will be insanely profitable despite how the current automotive market looks like and they are discounting the crazy competition. 

SPACs are just an opportunity for the riskiest companies to get funding. A majority of these companies will likely continue to ask for capital raises and likely go bust.

Green energy - may be the future, but mostly unprofitable and valuations are stupid.

Weed stocks - 95% of these companies will go bust. Weed is literally a weed. Anyone can grow it. I don’t think there’s any differentiation. Margins will be a continual race to the bottom. Not only that, but I think people severely overestimate the amount of people that would use weed when it’s legalized. Personally I might do it once in a blue moon for the novelty but I don’t think it’s going mainstream. 

Elon investing in Bitcoin was idiotic - crypto in general has no utility nor should be considered as a digital asset. If I were a Tesla shareholder I would be fuming that they put my money unsolicited into Bitcoin instead of investing it into their own growth",mcoclegendary,2,/r/stocks/comments/ltqnrm/unpopular_stock_opinions_discussion_thread/gp1tyte/,0.103,0.827,0.069,-0.9283

300,ARE," Big companies don’t pivot well, people running them are better off ditching the old structure and building anew.

Look at companies like Kodak, they dominated cameras, but now they aren’t good at it, I thought once USPS is going to be the biggest email provider when email became popular, that didn’t work. How many of the big type writer makers pivoted to become computer makers ? Even established banks and brokers who long have used technology in their bussiness are facing a stiff competition from newer and agile fin tech companies. 

EVs are much cheaper to run, and much cheaper to build and require less maintenance. China is poor in fossil fuel, they are full committed to electrifying the entire transportation spectrum, and if they make cheap solar panels and cheap EVs (and they already do both ) the rest of the world will follow.

Within 5-10 years we will have EVs with a range of 600+ miles that can be charged at home, and at price parity with gas cars if not cheaper. In fact I would argue that Tesla’s ARE cheaper than any gas car if you take performance and features into account. 


The rise of EVs will increase adoption of home solar, and that will take a huge chuck of demand from gas power plants, people with free electricity from their solar roofs will be inclined to update their home appliances, including HVAC  and dryers with devices that take advantage from the free electricity, so that is further demand taken out of natural gas.

It will take a couple of decades for that to happen, sure, but it will happen, and faster than you think. 

Fossil fuel will then only be used for making plastics and such, if the bio plastics don’t take that out of them.

311,EV," VW switched their whole manufacturing lines to a completely modular setup during the last 10 years. they can switch out about any car module from chassis to motor within months. they probably have the most flexible production lines out there. 

Nissan, as mentioned by others. They have been building the NIssan Leaf since 2010 (!!!) and have several iterations completed on it already. Why nobody talks about it ? I do not know. 

I personally LOVE Toyota. Instead of hopping on the EV Hype train like all the other companies, they actively bet on Hydrogen. Which is much much closer to current technology, scales much better and is drastically cheaper. it´s not without its own share of problems, yet offers  significan upside. it is also a much ""greener"" technology than batteries.   
(consider this: fueling a Toyota Mirai takes 5 minutes and gives you a range of about 400 miles). 

BMW and Mercedes. They will ride the fossil rocket a little longer, but already have promising models.

312,LOVE," VW switched their whole manufacturing lines to a completely modular setup during the last 10 years. they can switch out about any car module from chassis to motor within months. they probably have the most flexible production lines out there. 

Nissan, as mentioned by others. They have been building the NIssan Leaf since 2010 (!!!) and have several iterations completed on it already. Why nobody talks about it ? I do not know. 

I personally LOVE Toyota. Instead of hopping on the EV Hype train like all the other companies, they actively bet on Hydrogen. Which is much much closer to current technology, scales much better and is drastically cheaper. it´s not without its own share of problems, yet offers  significan upside. it is also a much ""greener"" technology than batteries.   
(consider this: fueling a Toyota Mirai takes 5 minutes and gives you a range of about 400 miles). 

BMW and Mercedes. They will ride the fossil rocket a little longer, but already have promising models.

They already have the infrastructure and partnerships that allow them to scale quickly. We’re just in the infancy of THC drinks—Coors only began selling THC drinks in Canada in August. There’s a huge addressable market for those who would prefer not to smoke or vape. Imagine going to a bar, getting high off THC drinks and not having a hangover? It could potentially change the bar scene, especially places where the smoking bans are. Someone is going to have a hit beverage. The beer companies have the motivation and reach to get there.

318,IMO," > If a company doesn’t have sufficient growth initiatives generating a high rate of return, then it doesn’t benefit you as a shareholder if they are just hoarding cash.

IMO there are always growth initiatives. No company has complete dominance of an industry and if they can't grow in their current subindustry for some reason they can always branch out horizontally or vertically. If a company can't find the proper vectors for 
 worthwhile growth then they're not trying hard enough. Also I call BS that hoarding cash does nothing for me as a shareholder. It makes a company's business and future prospects, and thus share price, way more stable. How can you say something like that given the last year is beyond me. We just had a perfect example of the safety net keeping cash provides.

>Now Tesla buying Bitcoin imo is akin to lighting cash on fire. With their significant growth they are throwing money instead into an unsolicited digital investment? This is far worse imo than giving it out as dividends.

I mean I'm not really going to argue much about tesla. That's a whole can of worms that's been discussed to death. Although ironically enough they made like 50% growth off that purchase(musk tweet market manipulation notwithstanding) at least on paper, so it's not really lighting cash on fire. *Should* they have done it?

319,THC," Do you ingest THC? I think you completely ignored my post. Where are you seeing that there’s a huge market for THC drinks? As someone who’s been in the scene since 2009 when medical became legal in Colorado I can tell you that drinks are not popular! People don’t like THC-infused drinks. They do not sell. Beverages are not a great way to ingest THC. If you take too much you can have a severe panic attack - even experienced users. It also takes much longer to hit you which makes it very difficult to titrate your dose with beverages. There are already much better ways to ingest THC than smoking or vaping. Vaping flower is pretty easy on the lungs and a great way to ingest. Otherwise there are edibles, pills, powders, etc. It seems like a lot of people who don’t have experience with marijuana think drinks are going to be huge. The market has already spoken in Colorado and California.

331,EC," Listen, this is what is happening.

Hedgies bought up all the ITM calls at around the 60/s mark. They flipped sides. They doubled their positions and are now LONG. They want GME to moon. 

The option writers now have to cover all those calls and naked calls. Hedgies make money because they are now long and price is going up.

This runs out of steam mid-week. Price hits the 200-300 mark and starts to fall. Hedgies then short it on the way down and make even more money and flip sides again.

Rinse and repeat every Friday until this runs out of steam. There is no MOASS coming. Hedgies have passed the bag to the MM contract writiers. Hedgies can exit short posiitons and still make money. With no MOASS, it makes it safer for Wall Street because the stock has lots of little squeezes but these are offset by big dips. No different to any 'normal stonk'. 

GME will never pass 500 based on the number of calls that are outstanding. There's lots of call options around the 150 mark, 200, 250 etc up to 500. After 500 it's a barren wasteland until you reach 800.  If it got to 800, it would probably trigger the MOASSx10 but good luck finding a way to boost it from 400 to 800 in a week. 

The next 3 weeks will be Monday price hikes to 200-300, maybe even 400 as lates as Tuesday, then large dips towards friday back down to the 100 mark.

After a few weeks, when all is settled, Papa Cohen speaks at the EC and the price gets another big boost before settling again.

Final price prediction for GME - Around the $140 mark. 

As the business turns around (and it will), it slowly creeps up to it's peak of around $200/s in a couple of years time.

I truely feel bad for some of the new people there trapped in an echo chamber of fantasies and false promises taking advice from people who wouldnt feel the impacts of their loss if it all goes south.
In wsb people always mention (or atleast when I was actively on there) that mark cuban told them to hold(he has no position in gme) or that DFV is holding so they are holding even though he made hella gains on puts. But even if he hadnt the amount he has lost is well worth it considering all the clout he has gained. If he made 2 or 3 times what he lost and spent it on advertising or expanding his avenues he wouldnt get remotely close to the coverage or the reputation he has recived.

My issue is people posting endless ""DD"" about a massive squeeze. It's pushing people to FOMO at high prices rather than learn about the market and how they can invest long or short term and make money.

The expectation is all wrong it's a promise of huge instant returns which 99% if the time have no basis in reality.

I think Southwest (LUV) will do better than most airlines during full recovery due to their model, but I’m not alone and I believe that’s why the stock price has almost fully recovered. 

So to answer your question, companies with strong models but their entire industry/sector was artificially depressed by quarantine.

Ideas?

If they start sailing out of the US this summer or fall I expect them to really take off. There is money to be made here.  Pre-pandemic CCL had close to 50% of the market and 40% of the earnings...

There may be better options than DAL, but out of those two that I looked at it seems the better option.

When airlines start traveling more they'll be looking for new equipment.  That's why I looked at BA. Pre-pandemic $350+ a share...$212 now. I believe they usually use Pratt and whitney engines, but pretty sure they are private. So I looked at RYCEY. Trading over $3 prepandemic...about $1.55 now (yes, diluted, etc).

400,BIG," What if?

I was thinking and reading a lot about what happened with GME, not only these past days but ever since the first squeeze. We all know that there were (and I believe still are) massive, short positions on GME. We assume that this was the cause for the first squeeze. However, many apes in [r/GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/) and other subs have already shown data that there were massive calls expiring when the first squeeze happened. Could It be that the first squeeze in January was caused by these calls?

Let us hypothetically assume that the shorts on GME were never covered during this first squeeze. Some data in the DD from [u/HeyItsPixeL](https://www.reddit.com/u/HeyItsPixeL/) shows that the currently estimated shares of GME are over 400% of its float.

If this is the case this means that it could be possible that during and after the January short squeeze no positions were covered. They were just balancing the cost of borrowing with the gains from the price drops after the first squeeze.

Why? Because they knew that if they would buy back the total position of all their borrowed shares including the naked ones that they would break the market.

But in that case, a GME MotherOfAllSqueezes is inevitable so what are they waiting for? My guess is that they are buying time to hedge by buying puts. [u/HeyItsPixeL](https://www.reddit.com/u/HeyItsPixeL/) has again in some amazing DD showed data supporting that massive amounts of puts on BIG companies are being bought. This could be a move to hedge if the inevitable MOAS will hit the market. Why? Because if this MOAS happens it will break the market and I think hedgies are buying time to hedge enough to protect them when this happens.

409,AAPL," This is great. Apple will be around for a long time. I got my son (he picked) a share of AAPL at $129 and it’s split twice and has dividend added since then. My only advice is to keep it diverse and since he has a long while before he needs to access it and if you don’t plan to go in and rebalance it often, a market index fund could also work. There’s also a 529 plan so that you can pull money out for school tuition, college expenses without taxes on any of the gains. 

And because I have a senior in high school, if he plans on getting financial aid someday when he is in college and independent of you, just know that these count against him. We are fortunate since I’ve been investing myself since I was 22, but that means that if he decides on one of the colleges he applies to and gets in, it’s $80-$100k/yr by the time he’s done with undergrad and he will need to go to grad school likely (that’s where it’ll really count against him since he will be an independent applicant).",TwoSuns168,9,/r/stocks/comments/ltsl85/please_judge_the_portfolio_ive_started_for_my/gp1javj/,0.0,0.958,0.042,0.7003

It's currently the largest company, but why else did you pick that company?

411,CPA," in principle it's a great idea. 

but the Ark ETFs are all less than 10 years old and haven't been tested by a major prolonged economic downturn. I think their success is partly just coasting on a bull market. so be careful, keep expectations in check. QQQ has a lot of crossover with an S&P 500 index, both are dominated by a handful of large tech companies. 

to keep costs low, assuming this is a taxable brokerage, I'd consider moving to Fidelity which has zero-fee index funds. VOO has a 0.03% fee, but FNILX also tracks the S&P 500 with zero fee. https://www.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/investing-ideas/index-funds

I'd also consider adding to a 529 plan for college or other post-high school education. many states offer a small tax break for 529 plans. and withdrawals are tax-free if used for qualified education costs. 

if you're in a higher income bracket, might want to look into an UTMA account. Uniform Transfer to Minors Act. Withdrawals will be taxed at your child's rate, rather than your rate. the typical 20 year old has a much lower tax rate than a 45 or 55 year old parent. an estate lawyer or good CPA can help with this.",harrison_wintergreen,4,/r/stocks/comments/ltsl85/please_judge_the_portfolio_ive_started_for_my/gp1jge8/,0.027,0.88,0.093,0.9234

438,GME," The best way to bet ""against"" usually is to do the counter-biased thing and purchase a call when a stock you watch is at a low point and everone can't get out fast enough. But you are the savant and think it can ""only go up from here, really"".

Oppositely, bet on the other direction for a ""downwards future development"" with a put if you think ""that price is insane, that's truly overheated!"" and ""can only go down from here on out"".

All this option play is super high risk with real chance to invite financial desaster. Usually it means you lose what you bet on your options. The worst case is you have puts or calls that contractually would oblige you to actually purchase the stock to buy/sell at that high (buy price higher than actual market valuation) or lower than market valuation price per share to someone selling you those contracts... ie take GME as the prime example of how this can go massively wrong.

For that, imagine you made someone pay you a premium in December to ""sell X GME for $105 in February"" ... when the price was raging way above when the contract would need to be fulfilled.

479,GME," I always pull a third out, then a third of what's left, after 4 iterations of that you're down to 20% of your original position's size.  Like dollar cost averaging but in reverse.  Your biggest pull will be the first, followed by the second, so if you're deep into green you won't have to worry about it dropping and losing most of your gains, since you already pulled most of your position.  Eventually you wind up with a very small position and it's house money - you pulled out enough that you paid for your entire position, have a profit, and paid for all the shares you still have in, so you can either close it out or let it sit and see what happens.

Also, don't look at things and think ""I wish I did something different"" or ""maybe I should let it run a bit longer"".  If you see something good right in front of you and your gut tells you to take it off the table, take at least some of it off the table.

Buying begets buying and selling begets selling, and sometimes it escalates quickly and then everyone realizes that maybe they shouldn't be buying into something running up that hard or selling into something dropping that quickly, and then it bounces.

If it starts crashing you might want to flip it around and pull 2/3 or all of it out, but if it's running up just pull a little at a time so you don't get that 'I wish I didn't pull everything too early' regret feeling that you'd get if you sold it all and saw it run up even higher.

When you start looking at things like that, the whole 'if it looks too good to be true', buying low and selling high makes sense - if you see the market crash and the S&P goes all the way down to 2500 really sharply, you might think to yourself, from the standpoint on getting a good deal, it might seem too good to be true that it just kind of tanked that much in a couple weeks or a month, like it did last March, and instead of being afraid, you might tend to look at it as a really really good time to buy, that kind of thing.

Yes apply to ETF too. For example let's say you bought Yolo, you later learn that its canadian cannabis and you think that's bad, its ok to sell it and buy MSOS for example, which is US cannabis. But selling something like VTI just cuz the market had a small correction is a mistake imo.

Coca Cola (KO). Everybody loves a coke. 

Proctor and Gamble (PG) They literally make everything you clean your house, clothes, or body with, and own a lotta snack foods too. 

Altria. (MO). Great dividend. Strong company. Despite what analysts “think”, smoking and chewing are continuing to remain a strong business. They also own a large chunk of Miller Coors brewing. 

General Electric. (GE). The néw CEO has turned Around the company. Brought their dividend back. 

Regions Financial. (RF). Biggest bank in the South. Maybe second to Wells Fargo down here. Strong business. Nice dividend.

Also, sbux reward system+ gift card part is acting as a bank, free money to sbux to hold and spend with 0 interest. How many other coffee place can do this?

577,CEO," Well, let’s look at this company from a few aspects of it:

1/: Good News : Plenty of cash !

This is great news, even it’s relatively new company;

In the tech space, having sufficient cash flow is great thing;

2/: Bad News :

Not projected to be profitable in the next 3 years.

But, hey, how many startup Tech companies make money in the first 3 years, right ? 

3/: Fundamentals:

a/: Sales growth:  last year grew by 35.8%,  it It is projected to by 19.5% in the next a few years. As a tech company, the growth rate is not handsome. But not terrible, neither.

b/: OK, like many new Tech company without profits, the only way to measure its future is its sales Growth. Frankly, 19% growth ( based on the public info that you can Google), is mid to lower end of growth. I will only pay a price 9 times of sales as their market cap. 

Currently, it is traded at $59.11 X outstanding shares = market cap = $ ?? 

I won’t pay more than 9 X annual sales.

591,IIPR," There is nothing that says you can’t do both. Growth stocks can be an exceptional value over the long haul. So can dividend stocks, particularly ones that grow their payouts over time. Good investors learn how to invest in both.

Certain stocks will fit the bill for both growth and dividends. One of my largest holdings is IIPR, which has seen incredible share price appreciation as well as dividend growth. Costco is another example (and one which I kick myself for not investing in). It has seen great growth, pays a modest quarterly dividend, but also pays out large special dividends every few years.

To learn more, I recommend reading One Up On Wall Street by Peter Lynch. He is largely considered to be the greatest money manager of all time, and the book provides a great framework for investing in both growth companies and dividend companies (along with other investments, such as cyclicals, asset plays, and turnarounds).",thats_your_name_dude,1,/r/stocks/comments/ltsf4v/is_it_smart_to_invest_into_dividendsetfs_or_just/gp2zz4z/,0.0,0.73,0.27,0.9922

I don’t believe all Chinese manufacturing companies are the same. While most might prioritize cost over quality, NIO is in the luxury market. This means they will need to attempt to achieve a level of quality of at least current luxury automobile manufacturers to be competitive. However, if they want to break into new markets, I believe they’ll need to exceed them.

594,ICE," On a macro level, China has a target to get 25% of all vehicles to EVs by 2025. If the target is met, expect a more aggresive position thereafter. They do this not just because of whatever climate agreements they've signed (which is mainly a marketing and political play), but more so because they want to reduce their reliance on oil and that air pollution is literally killing their industrialised cities.

ICE vehicles have a 4-6 months wait time for a registration approval whereas EVs are straight through. EVs get all sorts of rebates and tax reductions compared to ICE vehicles.

As a brand, NIO targets the luxury car market which means their prices tend to be higher with higher margins. The build quality is on par with the German pedigree brands like Merc/BMW/Audi etc. Just look up any review of NIO cars on youtube, there are many non-sponsored, independent videos.

Sure we can say that these brands are also producing their own EVs, but when we compare traditional car companies building EVs to specialists, we have to note that the ecosystem of the car is completely different. This includes software integration and centricity within the car, to the support infrastructure and services in the environment.

Specifically, NIO is creating an ecosystem of their brand, positioning themselves not just as clean vehicle manufacturers, but also clean and sustainable product manufacturers, with plans expand into apparel and other product segments. ""NIO houses"" are like luxury cafes where NIO owners hangout and share experiences they've had with the cars and give feedback to NIO customer service. They're building a culture along with a brand.

The direction that they've taken with battery swapping and battery as a commodity is a game changer especially in metropolitan cities where a huge majority of people live in high rise apartments. The swapping station takes up the footprint of 4 parking lots, is mobile, and can be re-deployed based on supply/demand. Commoditized battery means car owners get to upgrade their batteries as battery tech improves, without the need for major downtime or overhaul of the vehicle.

This essentially solves the most pertinent problem and main blocker of mass adoption of EVs - charging infrastructure and charge time. No one is the market is currently doing this.

And we have to remember that NIO is only just starting, with plans to expand globally. 

Not rebutting any of your points, I think the numbers and facts are all solid. But growth stocks (just like Tesla) tend to invite many interpretations, opinions, and sentiment, so everyone paints their own picture based on the palette in front of them.",fabbbles,3,/r/stocks/comments/ltsex8/bear_caseopen_discussion_on_nio/gp1x8g1/,0.04,0.846,0.115,0.9842

596,EV," Ok, elaborate?

NIO stock is literally a boom or bust situation. EV as a sector is not boom or bust. But to be more valuable than competitors, you have to make more money? Correct? When the prophecy is that you are worth this much $ today because we are pricing in how much you’ll be worth in the future. When the future comes, and you’re not worth what people thought, what happens to the share price? Does it keep going up 900% a year? No, it tanks. Investors aren’t patient and nor are the markets. NIO succeeds or the stock price will drop back to reality. 

Plenty of companies that ICLN hold could be boom or bust based on how overvalued they are. You get a little protection from this when you buy an ETF versus the individual company stock. 

You can’t take my reasoning on why NIO, an individual company, will struggle to succeed in the Auto industry/EV sector and apply it to the Energy sector as a whole and then say “see this doesn’t make sense”. Yeah it doesn’t because it has nothing to so with solar, wind, and a lot of other niches that ICLN is comprised of.
