2,GME," This is the stupidest fucking post I’ve ever seen about the stock market. 

A reminder that the stock market isn’t a money printing machine is the dumbest shit. I don’t think anybody that knows anything about the stock market thinks it’s a money printing machine, with the exception of some 19 year old who learned what the stock market was when wsb was spamming GME. 

It was only like 16 months ago that we had bloody October. Some of us were actually alive in 2008. 

You realize we got excited that the dow hit 25k THREE TIMES UNDER TRUMP.

27,GME," That 1st one especially, I see a lot of people getting into investing that seem to just ask people what stock everyone is buying, then buying for the sake of buying in order to copy, instead of actually understanding what it is. Imo, if you're able to understand it, you'll have much more confidence in holding it, almost regardless of short-term performances, since you'll have belief in why you think its going to do what it's going to do long-term. You might be right or wrong, but at least you can play with some strategy into it. 

As oppose to blindly making moves, then panicking over small dips, or even more during massive movements, lost at what's going on. I'm thinking about GME, many I recommended buying at under $50, then sold it as soon as they saw a slight dip, never riding to even above $100, then others that bought at $300, finally settling for something much less. I'll admit there's luck to it and I think the Gamestop situation was much more particular, since it's something that almost never happens in traditional markets, no one even experts could've anticipated we'd be cheated out the system, by hedge funds and brokerages who would just pause trading all of a sudden, but nonetheless the need to really understand what you're buying still stands.",LifeInAction,12,/r/stocks/comments/lnw3w5/stock_trading_101/go3kk60/,0.068,0.875,0.057,-0.5749

48,AMC," There might be a couple issues but I really don't think it's anything actually nefarious: (pure speculation BTW)

With something as volatile and hard to deliver as GME they may have pumped the brakes bc thousands possibly millions of crazy high limit sells could effectively spoof the system. I know this isn't intentional and spoofing is illegal but it happens. A lot of the ape gang have ridiculous limit orders in place already.

Secondly it could be bc of the time a brokerage is given to deliver. I couldn't sell CC on BB and AMC either a couple weeks ago, which I regularly do with other meme stocks. The stated reason was that the shares were too hard to borrow. This seemed odd bc I ""owned"" the shares. It was a quick play to capture IV crush or effectively a limit order so wasn't paying much attention to their delivery. Bc brokers get a little time to deliver shares.

49,BB," There might be a couple issues but I really don't think it's anything actually nefarious: (pure speculation BTW)

With something as volatile and hard to deliver as GME they may have pumped the brakes bc thousands possibly millions of crazy high limit sells could effectively spoof the system. I know this isn't intentional and spoofing is illegal but it happens. A lot of the ape gang have ridiculous limit orders in place already.

60,FOR," Why are they treating GME different from GOOG? Because one is Alphabet (a highly successful blue chip) and the other is GameStop (a highly unsuccessful, yet extremely volatile as of late stock).

To answer, it’s because a lot of things are tied to volatility of a stock; it’s not about GME, it’s about volatile stocks. GME has been extremely volatile, so different rules apply to it internally, it’s not a conspiracy, brokers set different rules for different volatility levels of stocks. Higher margin requirements, different limits on stock, etc. And no I’m not going to go setting a bunch of limit orders in to find examples FOR you. 

The answer is in front of your face and has already been given ad nauseam by Robinhood: the broker has to clear the trades, and if it is volatile then the broker runs into margin issues and becomes highly at risk to fluctuating prices. Schwab doesn’t want to let you set the price to $250, then have to “buy” that share from you at $250 as someone pumps the stock to 250 for two seconds before it falls to $20 again and they are stuck having to clear that.

The other reason: other bag holders of GME are probably setting sell orders at their entry price ~250 to 450. They can’t let everyone just set their exit at a super inflated price because they won’t be able to clear those orders effectively the higher it goes during time of volatility (and if GME gets to 250+ that will be a time of volatility) *especially* if a mass exit at that limit price *then* drives the price down.",Tbone-Steak,5,/r/stocks/comments/lnvero/i_strongly_suspect_that_schwabameritrade_does_not/go4agpc/,0.032,0.881,0.086,0.9392

62,GME," I completely agree. I had a sell limit order of 500 before the first spike. I then changed it 1500. After it dropped back downbto the 300s, I went to reset the value higher. It told me it was too high. So I decided to just change the number of shares. Said the value was too high. Then I tried lowering the price point to 500. Was still TOO HIGH. I finally tried deleting the limit order and set a new one. Everything was still too high. 

I get that this is a company that needs to survive and not get buried when GME goes to the moon. But this doesn't make sense to me. Why would the high limit order be allowed before the manipulation started, and now I can't set one remotely distant from the sell price now!?!?

My avg is 72 range. Im not severely in the red so I'm willing to ride this thing until the end.

90,GME," This is the same at Vanguard. When I submit the limit sell they say ""pending"" then the next trade day the order is canceled without explanation, email or any notification it was canceled. Which is concerning, if I didn't check I could have assumed the limit sell was set. 

They told me when I called that it is outside of the reasonable ""trading range"". I asked them why they could define what I was able to sell my shares for? Then explained that I don't have a limit on how much I can post my car for sale, for example. If I want to post an ad saying a million dollars for my Honda civic, why not? It's my car. 

The gentleman on the phone just laughed at me and said... they aren't going to accept a limit sell that high, sorry. So I asked him, how high can I set a limit sell for GME? He stated that he could not define that and wouldn't be able to tell me. He suggested I just watch the stock and if it goes up near that price, set the limit sale once it's closer to my asking price. 

So to clarify I asked him.. So you won't take my limit sell because it's to high due to it being outside of the ""trading range"" but you cannot tell me what the trading range is either in high and low dollar numbers or even a high and low percentage from current price? For example 80% higher or lower than current price. 

He said, that's correct. 🤷‍♂️

They don’t “let you do what you want” on their platform because they are *liable* for what occurs on their platform. Limit orders are a *service* provided by the platform, not simply something OP “should be able to do if he wants.” There are ramifications in risk and volatility that are included when you allow people to pre-program an exit or entry.

134,SI," On your point of short interest.

According to Webull as of 1/29 SI was 3.34M and free float sits at 18M, so about 18.5%. That seems high for a company with good fundamentals.

At the same time the market cap sits a 3.58B, and EPS TTM is positive. That could make it a candidate to enter the SP500 if it approaches 100$, at which point there would be a massive inflow of capital from index funds.

From a technical analysis point of view, it's been trading with higher minimums for some months finding now a good support at 38$ in the 50 day SMA and 1st Fibonacci level. I can see it breaking this structure and reaching 52$ in the short term.

As a long term play I am bullish, Corsair's sector will only increase with time, they have a good brand recognition and so far solid financials that if they can maintain with growth will put them in the SP500, at which point the shorts will need to rotate to higher prices.",trillo69,1,/r/stocks/comments/lnvgl7/taking_a_look_at_corsair_gaming_crsr_5_min_read/go50zlq/,0.0,0.824,0.176,0.9822

OP himself even admits there is no moat to the company. They _could_ dominate their industry segments, or they could continue to be a solid competitor.

Also if you had good positions in EV stocks why sell? i mean even if they don't grow as much as they did in 2020 (im sure they won't) i don't see a reason for a sell off and they are still very well positioned to grow into the future.. curious about that decision.

154,EV," I've been trying to shift to value/travel for awhile, but tax implications make it hard. I have a $160k gain from Roku that I don't really want to pay a 30%+ tax rate on. Same with $90k from Crsp (though this might actually end up being a bit smaller given it's recent trend). Short term taxes on those two might exceed my annual income....hard to swallow. I think a lot of people are stuck in the same boat. 

I have a feeling once most long-term investments start activating through the summer there may be a selloff on the weaker stocks. I've seen several predictions of a selloff in Summer/late spring as well due to long term gains coming into play (combined with vaccine distribution and reopening becoming more clear). 

I think stocks that have proven strong growth and market dominance like Telsa/Roku/Amzn/Nflx will hold steady though, since they are good long-term holds, even if they are overpriced atm.

164,IMO," I mostly do very small caps and micro caps lately, because those are on a great run. Those stocks are usually too small for posting in this subreddit because they discourage stocks that are under $10-$20, and that makes sense because just a few hundred buyers piling in can create a pump and dump situation. So I can't really discuss my super small micro tech stocks here.

I have put in a lot of work finding small caps and mid caps for my relative's dividend portfolio, and of those probably Flushing Financial (FFIC), which pays a 4.2% dividend is probably a safe but good recommendation. It's been solidly growing for months now, about 50% in the last 3 months, 20% since the start of the year. It's well rated on Wall Street, too. There are a lot of small cap financial stocks that are making good gains lately, tho, not just this one stock. So that's a sector/market cap combo that is worth a look, IMO. 

Small caps take a lot of time and effort, because there are so many and their growth arcs can be uneven. In the past couple of weeks I've put in time looking for small cap & mid cap thematic ETFs that have strong growth, because there wasn't enough time in my day to research all the small caps even just in the tech sector. 

I like Jacobs Internet mutual fund, JAMFX (which has some large caps but a lot of small caps and mid caps), and is actually beating the ARK funds lately.  JAMFX pays a massive dividend with a year-end conversion of gains to dividend, so you see a big drop in the NAV at the end of December when this dividend pays out. A non-fixed income person might just reinvest the year-end dividend. JMCGX is Jacob's microcap tech mutual fund, but I haven't been able to buy it through Fidelity, for some reason. A thematic tech small-cap ETF I like is BFTR, the Blackrock Future Innovators ETF, kind of like Blackrock's version of an ARK fund but for small caps. 

Buffalo Small Cap Fund, BUSFX, is a general (i.e. not specialized in tech or something) small and mid cap mutual fund that also pays a high dividend and is beating the small cap indexes. It was up 2.3% on Friday, beating the Russell 2000 composite and Russell 1000 value indices. Like JAMFX, it will dump a big percentage of its NAV into a dividend payout in December, so the NAV always looks like it takes an 8% dive at the end of the year, but it's just issuing a dividend that can be reinvested. 

PSCE & PSCM are small cap energy & mining ETFs and they have been outperforming the large-cap versions of energy & mining ETFs lately. PSCE has had twice the gains that XLE has had in the past 3 months: PSCE has had 61% gains in 3 months and XLE has had 29% gains. For a while I was killing myself researching small cap energy and mining companies and finally just gave up and bought into PSCE & PSCM, although I do have a couple of individual energy and mining stocks in my growth portfolio. KBWR is a regional banking ETF full of mostly small caps that has done very well recently.

Also, a lot of stocks in those sectors are still values and not overbought.

And the flip side - if PLTR goes to shit - you’ve essentially reduced your average price to $15 a share if the call isn’t exercised.

The call is out of the money and since you re-invest the premium, you even lose money from that. So that wouldn't be great, but a 2 year play is far off in the future. 

The other issue is that selling a call option that far out is troublesome because even if it expires in the money, the funds you purchased the 100 initial shares are simply locked up for 2 years. I think this is honestly the biggest crux of the method. The real trade off is the question 'is locking up $2900 for 2 years worth 50 shares of PLTR'.

180,PLTR," I don't think I like it. It seems that you created an unnecessary double hedge. 

Do you have additional cash available to cover the call if needed or would you have to sell the additional 50 PLTR you bought to do it? 

Options rarely get exercised before expiration. So you're locked into holding PLTR until Jan 2023 and selling 100 shares at $30 no matter what. That's a very long time and that's the part I wouldn't feel comfortable with. If the stock sails over $30 then you're basically bagholding until expiration. That money will no longer be making money for you. 

Having the additional 50 shares creates the double hedge. If the stock closes at - say $75 - on expiration, you do have a nice profit ($3750 from the 50 shares + $3000 from the call) but if you didn't do this whole thing, you would have 100 shares to sell at that price and make $7500.

And that's if it closes at $75 on expiration. If you had only the 100 shares, you'd be able to sell at anytime. It would be a real kick in the dick if the stock flies to $75 in 2022 and comes back to $33 in Jan 2023.

Since you're collecting the premium as cash, this would be true if you didn't buy the additional 50 shares. Assuming you ride until expiration, you've locked in $1490 regardless of what you do next.  

You're painting this as if you're getting 50 PLTR for free. You're not. Your initial investment isn't $2900. It's $4350 (150 shares @ $29) because you used money from the premium that you already had free and clear to invest in the stock. 

If the stock closes at $30 on expiration, then you'll lose 100 shares at $30 for a $100 profit (from the call) and you'll have 50 shares that sat around doing nothing for you for 2 years. In this case, it would have been better to use the premium you collected and invest in something else.

 This is neither a day trading or an investment strategy. You bought 150 shares but have 100 shares already set to be sold at a specific price and time.

193,PLTR," You’re looking at it wrong. You’re making two investment actions:

1) Invest $2,900 in PLTR. Sell a covered call at $30 strike for $1,490. Your max profit over a two year period is ~55%...approx 27.5% annualized. Meanwhile your max loss is 100%. I think the risk reward ratio you corner yourself into on this trade isn’t even close to worth it, but you do you. Furthermore, there’s always more theta to be made selling weeklies or even monthlies versus two years out. 

2) your second investment is buying more PLTR shares worth approximately $1,490. Is investing that into PLTR a good investment? I don’t know, up to you to decide. 

Whatever you want to do with the $1,490 is whatever you want to do. It’s not a part of investment number one detailed above. Ultimately investment number one is on its face a bad investment. You seem to be bullish on PLTR...bullish enough to buy 50 uncovered shares. So based on that thesis, why would you cover 100 shares at $30 (effectively $45 with the premium)? And for two years?!

* as frugal retirees in our 50s, we have no mortgage or debt, and live comfortably on 2 pensions. We won’t touch our 401k & other investment accounts for another 10+years;

* along with the pension from our former employer, we also have guaranteed health coverage (that we pay for) until we hit Medicare age.

I was working as a FT contractor for 2 years after I retired in 2017, and after maxing out my pre-tax 401k, I had leftover “gravy” money so we could travel a little more to see grandkids, etc., but COVID hit...so rolled the wad into self-managed retail investments at 165% gain since April 2020.

Since we weren’t planning on using the gains to live off of, and with travel in hold, we decided to use gains for gifting.

We gave money to all three of our daughters on purchase of their first homes/renovations over the last 12 Months.

(We had a deal with them from a young age, that if they didn’t have big weddings, we would gladly gift them first-time home purchase deposit money, up to allowable amount without a gift tax).

219,CEO," I can barely remember the names of some of the dogshit companies I actually bought.  :)   

It was easy for a young, inexperienced investor to get taken in.  In hindsight it was like a giant pump and dump where nearly everyone was complicit, the financial media, the general media, the companies' management, the supposedly independent financial analysts, fellow investors.  Nearly all the information you were getting was designed to keep the party going as long as possible.  So even though you could laugh at a clueless CEO who had demonstrated he did not understand the technology his company was supposedly developing--think Trevor Milton of Nikola and his HTML 5 supercomputer--there were other companies that everyone agape at dodgy estimates of their future total addressable market and bogus metrics used to show quarterly growth.",TrioxinTwoFortyFive,1,/r/stocks/comments/lns27w/warren_buffets_thoughts_from_pg_14_of_2000/go5kiib/,0.049,0.829,0.122,0.8834
220,MO," Think about moving to a dividend income strategy. Check out MO. Maybe AT&T.

Check out a dividend calculator.

If you put in 100k to MO at 7.92 div yield ($3.44 annual per share dividend), with some modest div growth expected (1.2% per year) and share price appreciation (3% per year), you'd be earning close to $20k/mo ( 230,000 / year) in dividend income. Total investment would be worth over $2.3 million ($2,315,850.79) and that's AFTER 15% tax on all the dividend income. Further, total dividend income would be $1,939,577.15.  and that shows you the crazy power of dividend income over time.

221,DCF," > I think stocks are ridiculously cheap if you believe ... that 3% on the 30-year bonds makes sense,” Buffett said in an interview with CNBC’s Becky Quick on “Squawk Box.”

This was from 2019 and Warren has concerns that the market Dynamics can't last.  It's 2021 and the 30 year yield is now 2%.  

Bonds/treasuries are so expensive they make stocks look cheap even at historically ridiculous valuations.  I sold IEF (7-10 year treasury fund) recently that I'd held for most of a decade.  Rates have raised to the point it'll likely pay 1.5% this year and going up but fund is already down 2.3% YTD.  It's worse than cash rn both protect that money from a downturn but cash you'll at least be on the plus side ignoring losing to inflation.  Stocks are really your only hope for any upside rn.  Runaway inflation is a big risk but the general thought is we'll get a crazy year or two due to stimulus and pent up demand and then it'll go back to his it's been the last decade.  Low inflation and bond yields due to outsourcing and tech which haven't gone away with their deflationary pressure.

If you're worried stay away from everything recommended here for the most part.  Due to how DCF is calculated high growth stocks benefit the most by lower yields and will suffer the most if yields have to go up considerably.  That's why we got all the woe is me, why is everything down so much threads last week w/ the S&P down less than one percent.  Yields spiked a bit too fast and spooked the market and they instantly hammered a lot of those high growth stocks 10-20% over a couple days.",aspergillum,2,/r/stocks/comments/lns27w/warren_buffets_thoughts_from_pg_14_of_2000/go4j4m4/,0.133,0.794,0.073,-0.9557

229,GME," Ok, hopefully this will make you feel better. As in not that I left a lot more than you on the table with GME but that I'm at peace with myself.

I cashed out $325,000 from GME. I had 2600 shares at an average of about $19. Had I sold all at a reasonable price, say $250 that would have been $650,000. Had I sold at not even the tip top, say $375 that's just shy of a million.

I took a little profit with 500 shares at $60 something. Had the rest for the crazy run up. The best I did was a 750 share lot at $252.

So, yeah, I left a lot of money on the table but hindsight is 20/20. But I'm 60 (can't you tell by the hindsight axiom?) and this helps the retirement quest quite a bit. Good for me.

246,DD," The major factor in this new wave of retail investors is that a lot of them are relatively young, mostly in their 20s. It's easier than ever to access the market with discount brokers and all the information you need to learn how to invest is on the internet.

Young people are less risk averse, largely because of a lack of experience and financial obligations. They might have rent and tuition, but it's a lot different than having a mortgage, retirement, bills, or even supporting children. What this creates is that a lot of young investors are making risky plays. Most of their portfolio might be in a few volatile stocks (PLTR, PLUG, TSLA, etc...) or ETFs (ARK funds, ICLN, etc...) rather than a traditional diversified portfolio.

BB could be making 2x revenue growing at 16%. CRWD could be 22x revenue growing at 86%. There is your 10x, it’s coming from a 5 year forward view.

Now this very much assumes a naive projection of the current trends into the future. CRWD will likely sustain its growth but slow down. 

I do agree it’s interesting to see BB with an up year in revenue after being viewed as a declining business since their smartphone days.

So in summary, I think there is a value investing opportunity in BB if you believe the turnaround story. But with current trends on a 5 year time horizon, the difference seems completely reasonable.",vansterdam_city,1,/r/stocks/comments/lob3m5/crwd_vs_bb/go5faqq/,0.012,0.825,0.164,0.9591

They just completed their first crop this year.

If everything goes according to plan, Canada will position itself as the #1 distributor of psilocybin for the treatments of depression and anxiety. They’ve just acquired Mindspace Wellbeing in Montreal in a bought deal at market price.

Garena is a mobile game company which has the worlds most actively played game, Free Fire (at least it was when I last checked on it a month or two ago). Free Fire is a battle royale type game that players spend money on skins etc.Shopee is an e commerce similar to Shopify or amazon. And Sea Money is a mobile banking company similar to square that ties into Shopee.

Yes, the company is still unprofitable but that is because they are heavily investing in the business and the logistics within the company. They are following the same strategy that amazon followed when they were growing. 

Their management is fantastic. It’s fun by Forrest Li (fucking badass name). He’s got a degree in engineering and an MBA in business from Stanford. On the board are the former Ministers of trade from both Indonesia and Singapore (to my knowledge similar roles as Jerome Powell for the countries). 

The competitors are Lazalde (Alibaba owned). Someone mentioned Takopedia but I haven’t researched them much and haven’t heard them come up as a true competitor before. I’ll research it later.

This could play a role in their slower growth in the region. Speaking of the region, there are around 600 million people in Southeast Asia, double the market of the United States.

Furthermore, there have been recent reports that SEA may be entering the South American market, another under served region with 600 million people. Although I’m sure they’ll face stiffer competition from MercadoLibre than their currently facing against Alibaba.

363,ABNB," It won't be years before it catches its share price because the entire market is overvalued. What will happen is this:

* ABNB will surge ahead of booming business as the economy reopens in full and pent-up demand results in the biggest year ever for travel. But AirBNB will never catch their stock price as long as *every* stock is overvalued

* The market will crash, and ABNB stock (and their business) will take a serious hit

* Somewhere in the climb back, the two will presumably match up again.

I am much more optimistic than others here around ABNB, but people around here tend to be pessimistic about new tech stocks with recent IPOs (even though some of those, like FVRR and PINS, are the top performers in my portfolio – imo new, brand name tech stocks are the most likely route to 10x your money)

AirBNB has a phenomenal business model, and they have to spend very little in marketing relative to the money they make. I think they're going to go on a run in the short term and will grow long term. When the next crash comes, I expect them to take a sizable hit – IMO they're a great stock for the next year and a great stock to hold 5+ years, but the 1-5 year range is less clear to me

I'm also a little wary of regulation here. Tech companies like Uber and Doordash have so far been great at pushing back on regulation, even in ballot measures in liberal states like CA. AirBNB might be different. It converts residential housing into tourist housing, and people interact with housing much differently than with delivery services – most people experience housing costs in the rising rent they pay and the increasingly visible homeless crisis on many cities' streets.

I too called cs but their only response was

I told them 
 I didn't file the options paperwork so I can't be eligible for shorting myself/options. Has to be a glitch.

Nah. Just brushed me off and said look you can cover it or wait 30 days

398,GME," How long did you wait in between those 2 sell orders? I use Schwab too and if the order can’t go thru, it gives me an error instead of saying “order submitted”. So it looks like your first order went thru but because their system was overloaded that day, it just glitched and didn’t actually show up as the order submitted? 

Also, I’ve never shorted a stock in the traditional sense in that I borrow shares and then sell them hoping for the price drop. Does Schwab allow you to do that? I.e if Monday I wanted to go to any stock I don’t currently own, and I submit a sell order for 10 shares, then I’ll be able to sell 10 shares and it’ll show up as I’m holding -10 shares? If Schwab allows you to do that, I’m afraid you might have a lot tougher of a battle as technically it would have gone into their system as you shorting GME in the second order you submitted.

402,GME," > No, not in a cash retirement account. What you're describing is a feature that should be available in margin accounts only.

From my personal experience, Schwab doesn’t stop you from doing things on your account that you’re not authorized to do, they just penalize you for it if you end up violating. 

I violated some margin trading rule back in January (not GME related) that I was completely unaware of and they locked my account from trading on margin for 90 days (I don’t trade on margin anyways). I called them and asked why there wasn’t some flag or message that prevented me from making the trade, and the guy said there’s no error message I just have to be aware of it myself lol.

I agree the second trade shouldn’t have gone thru based on the type of account you have, I’m just sharing what happened with me bc maybe your case is similar? Idk

My only other advice would be to contact a lawyer bc the amount you lost is staggering and def worth trying to get back.",theironicfinanceguy,2,/r/stocks/comments/loffqz/a_bug_in_schwab_caused_my_retirement_account_to/go5mmw4/,0.115,0.827,0.058,-0.8718

404,ATH," As a recent T purchaser, I'll try to make my bull case.

I see both value and growth in the company.  The stock has traded sideways to down for so long that people assume it is only a dividend play.  Reminds me of when I bought MSFT in 2014.  P/E is a bit off now because of the write down of Direct TV, but they had 27B in free cash flow in 2020 and projected similar for 2021 vs a market cap of just 206B.  This is low-risk value in any industry, but especially compared to TMUS, DIS.

I see some moderate bottom line growth in 2021-2022 due to COVID recovery on Warner & Direct TV, HBO Max subscriber increase from international rollout, mobile & fiber subscriber increase, and higher margins due to OpX efficiency. Longer term, I see 5g as a big driver in top line and margin growth. They have foot holds across the value chain from mobile & fixed network to cable/streaming subscriptions to content creation.  And I see this value chain consolidating across the industry as 5g is truly deployed in 2023 and beyond. This should be much less operating and capital expense intensive and also provides a chance to pickup customers from Charter, Comcast, Verizon, DISH and T-Mobile, who have far more narrow platforms currently. I think there is also opportunity to increase advertising, data, and consumer device revenue to the top line.

Weaknesses & Threats include high debt/dividends and customer relations. The CEO covered this on their Q4 conference call.  [AT\&T; (T) Q4 2020 Earnings Call Transcript | The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/att-t-q4-2020-earnings-call-transcript/) . Essentially, they restructured the debt to make if more favorable in the near term and are committed to using the 11B+ in free cash (after 16B dividends) to pay down the debt. But with recent M&A, CapX, and 5g spectrum buys, it may take awhile. Meanwhile, they are missing out on another 8B in free cash flow each year due to interest.  Growth analysts want them to freeze the dividends and pay down the debt to get the earnings and stock price up; Dividend analysts want to keep the quarterly div payments to supplement grandma's social security checks. I don't really care either way but if feels like they are getting beat up from both sides, keeping the stock price down.

He also addresses customer retention/satisfaction in the earnings call above. They've been losing cable subscribers fast and TMUS was eating their lunch in mobility through 2020 Q3 but ATT fought back and won some in Q4. We saw TMUS stock price drop from ATH of 135 down to 120 but that capital didn't get plugged back into T shares price.  They have data to back up the Q4 customer focus with net adds, slower churn, and improved results on customer surveys. Still, as someone interested in moving from their cable to streaming service, I can't figure out what they hell is going on with all their various platforms. They need to take lessons on building an easier customer model.

[AT\&T; (T) Q4 2020 Earnings Call Transcript | The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/att-t-q4-2020-earnings-call-transcript/) . Essentially, they restructured the debt to make if more favorable in the near term and are committed to using the 11B+ in free cash (after 16B dividends) to pay down the debt. But with recent M&A, CapX, and 5g spectrum buys, it may take awhile. Meanwhile, they are missing out on another 8B in free cash flow each year due to interest.  Growth analysts want them to freeze the dividends and pay down the debt to get the earnings and stock price up; Dividend analysts want to keep the quarterly div payments to supplement grandma's social security checks. I don't really care either way but if feels like they are getting beat up from both sides, keeping the stock price down.

He also addresses customer retention/satisfaction in the earnings call above. They've been losing cable subscribers fast and TMUS was eating their lunch in mobility through 2020 Q3 but ATT fought back and won some in Q4. We saw TMUS stock price drop from ATH of 135 down to 120 but that capital didn't get plugged back into T shares price.  They have data to back up the Q4 customer focus with net adds, slower churn, and improved results on customer surveys. Still, as someone interested in moving from their cable to streaming service, I can't figure out what they hell is going on with all their various platforms. They need to take lessons on building an easier customer model.  But at the end of the day, their cable loses are back-stopped by their own streaming assets and the real risk is losing to TMUS/VZ as 5g rolls out.",visgc,2,/r/stocks/comments/lnw7lx/thoughts_on_t_in_terms_of_long_term_growth_vs/go5dpfz/,0.082,0.744,0.175,0.9948

Sold OPTT at $7.50 by March 19. It is under $5 right now so chances of it hitting $7.50 aren't too high. But it is green energy so you never know with catalysts. If it happens I would be stoked as I bought at $5 so that's $250 profit even if it goes higher. If it doesn't, it is green energy stock so I will hold anyways as this can be the future. The premium was $38 (0.38 x 100) so it was nothing. I just hope the price increased to $5 or more and then get better premiums later while I reevaluate. I wanted to do a longer one (May or later) but there were no buyers there so I just settled for March.

Sold ATOS at $5 by April. It is below $4 right now and I own 400+ shares so I didn't mind losing 100 of them at $5 if it really takes off. I also took the premium to buy more ATOS stock which put my total to about 496 which is close to being able to sell another future call since it is 100 per contract.

It is good if you are going to hold the share regardless of what happens and you don't mind selling even if you could've gotten more gain.

To your other questions - it’s a good strategy to make some extra money on a stock you’re okay selling at that strike price. But you’re capping your upside as someone else pointed out. You’re also getting paid for shares you already own - which if the price stays level or decreases you’re ahead.

Year out calls on a stock like TSLA is risky for both parties - because Tesla can easily go to $2,000 in a year based on its movement in the last 8 months. Or it could collapse and go to $400.

Take UBER and Spotify as an example. They are the leaders in their sector, not generating a profit. And we don't know if that will ever happen, since huge competitors are entering the market as well (Apple Music, Youtube Music, Tesla, Waymo, Apollo etc.) takinf costumers away

I'm not saying that Ark haven't done a good job. But growth is growth, and we'll see if most of them can turn their reach into profit. I've given the examples of Uber and Spotify - will they ever make money? We don't know. Another one is Slack.

468,TD," Mandatory disclaimer, I'm not a financial advisor and I can't give you financial advice.

If you had $2000 in apple in 2016, it would be worth 10k now.

If you did research and invested in any of these risky stocks back in 2016 because there was a bunch of good news about them,

[Best Penny Stocks to Watch Today 3/9/2016 (yahoo.com)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-penny-stocks-watch-today-162500247.html)

Well, you would have either lost money or made no where near that.

So yea, it's hit or miss unless you know what you are doing and are performing hours of research into every trade, and at that point you may as well just get a job.

I'm not telling you what you should or shouldn't do, I just feel like trading away Apple stocks to make high risk trades is like trading Lebron James because you think you might be able to sign the next big player.

The one thing I'll definitely say, if you do sell your apple stock for something else, do it because you are confident that there's a stock which is about to take off. Not because you saw it was trending on TD Ameritrade, not because a bunch of idiots on WSB are saying to buy and hold (what they really mean when they say that is buy and hold so that they can sell and make money while you are screwed), but because you have something solid

Example:

""I think this company's thing is going to take off, at least that's what this ""top 10 tech stocks to invest in NOW"" article said.""

That's retarded.

""This company sells millions of these things in Japan and turns a profit every year. I think it's only inevitable that they expand into Europe and America, which would quadruple their market cap. Oh, and nobody is talking about it, which means this information probably isn't already reflected in their stock price.""

That's not as retarded, you at least have a strategy in your gambling. But remember, it is a gamble, nobody really ever knows what is going to happen in life, and it is very difficult to beat the market in the long run. Sure you might get a 25% return then you screw up one month for 16% loss and look, hours of research for that 11% when you could have just kept your apple stock and done nothing for probably the same thing

521,USA," Two that I think are worth looking at for dividends are Coca-Cola company. I think I read somewhere they have increased their dividend every single year for the past 58 years or something crazy. Just a stable stock that is easy to understand the business model and easy to see the demand first hand while receiving your dividend every year. The next would be Altria. They are a company that profits off of addiction. Mainly cigarettes, and pays their shareholders dividends for investing with them. Recently they are trying to switch off entirely from ciggerates and go to this non com-busting vape they own patents on, but truthfully I think the real future for Altria is weed. They have always proven profitable in the adult product market and have their products already positioned everywhere in the USA with every convenience store and grocery store owning a ciggerate booth. All they have to do is switch a certain ciggereate package/brand to now do weed pre rolls 100% of the time and they will have their legal weed sold all over the place. They have invested in Cronos, a weed company in the USA so it’s not some far off distant thought either.",CLYDEFR000G,1,/r/stocks/comments/loen1n/high_earning_monthlyquarterly_dividend_stocks/go5kox7/,0.014,0.871,0.115,0.9485

531,AMD," New Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger started on Tuesday, perhaps why its slightly up this week.  He brings a lot of energy, hope, and an engineering background, but Intel has a big hole to dig out of.  AMD has performance leading products at lower prices so they're eating into Intel's market share quickly.  Intel is expected to respond to this growing competition but with their manufacturing delays (which are hopefully behind them now) its likely a few years before Intel has a chance to regain the thrown on performance.  I would not count Intel out yet, they are pissed they got caught snoozing and will claw their way back.

That said, the first big wildcard that I see right now is Biden's recent announcement to address the issue around the reliance on foreign manufacturing, namely from TSMC.  It could play out in many different ways, but Intel seems well positioned already having manufacturing across the world but also at home in the U.S., something AMD does not.

The second wildcard is ARM.  The big recent news was Apple's M1 chip which is better performance than Intel or AMD.  How does Intel or AMD respond to this?  Do they let the big players like Apple, Google, Microsoft, etc build their own chips and they just focus on those who cannot, or is there another play?  I don't know that Intel has a response to this yet, but they're definitely talking about it.  Pat even brought up the M1 directly in his welcome webcast to employees and the threat it poses.

635,GM," >Sorry if I’m stereotyping, but I imagine a lot of people who drive trucks are somewhat against electric vehicles, but they’re going to have to come to terms with the fact that that’s where the world is going. That being said, Ford has made it clear that they want to change their vehicle production to all electric, and if any company can convert the minds of all the people who are against electric vehicles, I think it’s Ford. 

I think the pickup truck market will really like the torque EVs can put out, plus the mechanical reliability they supposedly will have.  

However, the big issues are with batteries, especially range and thermals.  That's the key bit of technology the value proposition hangs on.  Gasoline and diesel are excellent at packing a lot of energy into a small volume, and in cold environments batteries struggle, whereas ICEs benefit from the thermodynamics.  

While many automakers are pledging to go all-electric, the speed of such a transition will be highly regional and market-specific. I agree that Ford has better odds of handling that than GM from a marketing+business perspective, but Ford historically hasn't been as good as GM with electrical things.

My big question is if Geely will start to significantly enter the US/European market at some point.",Tehbeefer,1,/r/stocks/comments/logla3/which_automaker_will_be_the_msft_of_ev/go5qdzu/,0.026,0.842,0.131,0.9761
636,IMO," the 401k allocation is great IMO. small and mid-cap tend to outperform large cap over time, but many investors have very little or no expose to these stocks. a total market index is about 5% small and 15% mid, while the S&P 500 is only about 10% mid cap IIRC and the rest all large cap. I like a healthy chuck in mid/small.",harrison_wintergreen,2,/r/stocks/comments/lo9dnz/hows_my_portfolio_look/go4opvl/,0.062,0.801,0.136,0.7242
637,BH," > Berkshire Hathaway has underperformed the S&P500 in like the latest 5 years 

on the Morningstar podcast, Charles DeVaulx said BH has underperformed only because of the large cash holdings. adjust for that, and all the underlying companies/stocks are outperforming by a substantial margin.

But then again I read Chinese news and have a social groups in China that keep me up to date on latest trends in China.

643,EV," It's more private greed than government conspiracy. A few reasons why Chinese companies list on US exchanges (and on HK and London exchanges):

1. Air of legitimacy and success. Think of it as PR/marketing. When you say you're listed on NYSE or NASDAQ, you give the impression back in China that you're a legitimate business and a successful one. Why wouldn't you be? The Americans with all their experience, regulations, and scrutiny have arguably vetted your company, so you must be legit, right? Of course, Chinese consumers are obsessed with foreign commodities. While we in the US are hoping for some of the Chinese EV companies to get the same growth as the famous US ones, Chinese citizens are flocking to purchase US EVs in China because it's a symbol of success. This isn't a new phenomenon. If you've visited China, you'd see that people will generally drink Coke and Pepsi products over domestic alternatives. Simply put, in China, you succeed when your kids study abroad in the US and you can show off foreign-made luxury goods. As such,  **listing in the US helps a company build up its legitimate success (or con its consumers) back home.** In the end, it just comes down to which companies are for real and which aren't. (As a general rule of thumb, I'd stay away from holding a long position in a Chinese company unless there's strong evidence that it's actually operating.)
2. USD-RMB exchange rate. Getting the Benjamins is always a plus. Especially when it equals around 6.50 of your native currency.
3. Global publicity. For example, Chinese EVs can get attention from US/international investors if they list on US exchanges. This gives the company additional sources of revenue outside of China. Especially if the Chinese company plans to break into the US market.

Of course, some US-listed Chinese companies are state-owned. But it's hard to say if some of the random ones we see on the exchanges are state-owned.

EDIT: Forgot to add, yes, sometimes a Chinese company will end up conning US investors. If I were to give it my uneducated guess, it's likely to happen around 1/3 times. So tl;dr, **INVESTOR BEWARE!**",517UATION,3,/r/stocks/comments/lntv83/chinese_companies_on_nysenasdaq/go2fw9z/,0.03,0.879,0.091,0.9755
644,IMO," IMO it's more like a big scam cooperated between those Chinese companies and Wall Street. I am not sure about the political motive behind. But I am sure the goal is to target American investors' pockets, co-conspired with wall street.",thevalleylife,3,/r/stocks/comments/lntv83/chinese_companies_on_nysenasdaq/go2c04i/,0.181,0.755,0.064,-0.6242
