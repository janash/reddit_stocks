76,IGC," Ooof. I got smacked today. I am happy about this new day momentum strategy I found but today was a lesson to me in how hard it can backfire when you donâ€™t pick tickers well. 

Saw IGC with a seemingly good setup in the 7-8 hour and focused on it too soon which made me miss IPA which had infinitely better fundamentals. Need to keep and vigilant mind longer and do more research before picking a target in the future.

Sucks cause that cost me 60 of the 100 bucks I made yesterday (this is why I am working with a small account and trying to work up) but honestly i probably needed to get humbled.

166,DD," This company doesn't have a cure for anything, they have procedures that treat a few diseases very effectively have contracts in numerous markets for them. The big news is that they are developing technology to treat some major diseases and preclinically the tech has shown to be better than anything available today, so they are working with the FDA to start human trials. The company is 5 years old from going public, so no, there's not a lot of cash on hand...it's a 3 cent stock. As far as the management team goes, it includes Amit Patel, the inventor of Jadi Cell and the first surgeon to put stem cells in the human heart; Thomas Ichim, the founder of Medistem - which was bought out in 2014; and Camillo Ricordi, the top scientist in the world in his field, to name a few. So while I understand what you are saying, I don't see how your comment is valid outside of cash on hand. Since you were PM'd about this more than once per your statement (and even thanked me for the invite at the time), it looks like you didn't do any DD to make a valid point.
