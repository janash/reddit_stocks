Regarding doubling down on the shorts, I'm not entirely sure how it happened because it's likely that there are many more players than just Melvin Capital on the receiving end of this clusterfuck (hell even I considered shorting GME prior to Ryan Cohen's arrival on the scene but diamond hands all the way now...) but I reckon they must have thought that the price action upwards wasn't warranted by the fundamentals of GME and were happy to open more shorts expecting to make even more money when it did eventually come back down. What I don't get about this though is that if you're some hotshot hedge fund manager why wouldn't you see the potential for a short squeeze? Maybe they underestimated the ability of retail investors to band together and bend them over the barrel. 

Take with a pinch of salt as i'm trying to understand all of this and like you said think that doubling down on your position is a strange choice to make, would love for someone with more knowledge of wtf is going on to come in and correct anything that i've said but that's my understanding of the situation so far!",0.052,0.824,0.123,0.9559

If they don't have to pay heavy margin interest, then I suspect they will just sit on the stock for 6 months or a year or 5 years if they have to in order to avoid massive losses.

147,QS,"Please advise (somewhat threadjacking) - 

Should I sell my meagre holdings in Nio and LIT (both safe companies that have been steadily rising) to buy a GME stock? This would cost an additional $60 in brokerage fees. 

(I do have the “gambling” funds to buy it outright, but it takes 48 hours to go through as I’m not in the US)

I also have Tesla shares that I’m not touching 

Major FOMO... but could be like the QS disaster - is it probable GME will dip massively when the market opens tomorrow? Or could it continue to rise massively?

It's not that the current quarter doesn't matter but I'd say a stock's AH move is probably about 90% guidance and 10% results. Sometimes if expectations are high or a stock's gone on a run leading up to the quarter it can still fall despite a beat and raise. Often times specific comments on the call can set off a negative reaction in the stock too. All of this is why I recommend to my friends that they shouldnt play earnings lol.

Last time this happened in March, centrals banks and in particular the Fed, made it crystal clear that they don't want financial assets to be cheap and interest rates high. They've also said they will support the markets should they crash. At some point in March, the Fed said they will inject $1T of repo a day if they have to to calm the credit market.

As much as I agree that we're in a bubble and it's supposed to end badly, it won't. I think the governments around the world will continue to issue more debt, print more money or bank reserves, and manipulate markets because they have to. The alternative is to let the free market correct 80-90% and have the economy go into a deep deflationary recession with massive layoffs, bankruptcies, probably also riots and famine. Absolutely no government in the world wants that, none.

I think what the central banks and governments are doing (QE, YCC, etc.) is eventually going to lead to inflation and growth in earnings and GDP. Over time, P/Es will come down as the major currencies lose purchasing power. We could have 5-10% dips, but don't expect a 30-50% crash (or if it does happen in 5-10 years, know that you have days or weeks to buy the dip, not months).",0.057,0.857,0.086,0.7169

A minority of companies made up a disproportionate amount of the gains and overcame the losses of others for the overall indexes to be up. Energy sector is very oversold. Tech sector is insanely overbought. COVID core stocks are just starting to wane from lofty valuations. COVID ravaged stocks, a lot came back despite being nowhere close to back to normal operations. Your mileage will vary I think but the money isn’t going to leave the market, just going into other areas. Nobody is pulling money out of the market and buying bonds at the current interest rates.

The vaccine rollout is much slower than expected, and it looks like the current vaccines may not be able to protect against the South African variants. New mutations could evade it completely. I think people are waking up to this unfortunate reality. We might see restrictions eased in the summer but more lockdowns next fall and winter.

I've also heard from Katie Woods' podcast that the FED may not be able to keep rates this low for as long as planned. If they raise the interest rate even slightly, that could precipitate a crash.

Always a bit of luck and some patience. I try to find stocks that have a price to book ratio that is below their median p/b ratio as well as compared to their industry peers. Tech companies have P/ZM. Ratios that are like 30-50 whereas energy stocks are around a 1-4 ratio. Container and oil tank companies seem to have a P/B ratio of 1.0. 

Metrics and fundamentals aren’t popular these days but they are relevant. Lot of people have a favorite but I think you need to cross check each one with another to give it a reality check. Old timers like PE ratios under 20 to show something is undervalued. PE ratios cash be misleading since they don’t take into account future upside of a growth stock or a disrupter. P/B ratio on the other hand is useful in determine if a stock is historically undervalued or overvalued compared to previous P/B ratios it was trading at. For example lets look at Occidental. In September it’s book value was $22 a share but it’s stock price was around $10. Giving it a P/B of .5. In 2019 it traded most of the year around it’s book value which is common for an energy stock paying dividends. So with this historical information and verifying the book value looking at their quarterly financials we can theorize that the stock has the potential to get into the $20s. Now given the world happening around it with oil prices we want to make sure they were trending in the right direction as well which they started to do.  

Now if you check the price of OXY today its in the low $20s so our theory panned out. Energy stocks are pretty easy to evaluate compared to other companies where a lot of the value is brand and IP.  The idea with OXY was it should at least get back to half of what it was worth given how much it was oversold. As for a long term holding of it given the current political environment it’s sex appeal will be limited going forward but the world still needs oil and if oil prices go higher OXY’s financials might improve and we can check in on the P/B ratio again and see what’s going on. 

I did the same kind of analysis for coal stocks such as ARLP and ARCH. Actually ARCH I tested the theory out and bought like 10 shares just to keep track of it and did well on it so I bought more. Then it ebbed and flowed with the COVID news cycle (up on vaccine news, down on lockdown news, etc.) 

PEG ratio serves as good reality check to your hypothesis in looking at a stock. If it’s over 1 you might want to start with a smaller position see how it goes. 

For stocks that are still off their pre-COVID highs a long play could be profitable if they’re fundamental business prospects haven’t changed such as the case with a lot of the tech companies.

524,OXY,"Surely!

Always a bit of luck and some patience. I try to find stocks that have a price to book ratio that is below their median p/b ratio as well as compared to their industry peers. Tech companies have P/ZM. Ratios that are like 30-50 whereas energy stocks are around a 1-4 ratio. Container and oil tank companies seem to have a P/B ratio of 1.0. 

Metrics and fundamentals aren’t popular these days but they are relevant. Lot of people have a favorite but I think you need to cross check each one with another to give it a reality check. Old timers like PE ratios under 20 to show something is undervalued. PE ratios cash be misleading since they don’t take into account future upside of a growth stock or a disrupter. P/B ratio on the other hand is useful in determine if a stock is historically undervalued or overvalued compared to previous P/B ratios it was trading at. For example lets look at Occidental. In September it’s book value was $22 a share but it’s stock price was around $10. Giving it a P/B of .5. In 2019 it traded most of the year around it’s book value which is common for an energy stock paying dividends. So with this historical information and verifying the book value looking at their quarterly financials we can theorize that the stock has the potential to get into the $20s. Now given the world happening around it with oil prices we want to make sure they were trending in the right direction as well which they started to do.  

Now if you check the price of OXY today its in the low $20s so our theory panned out. Energy stocks are pretty easy to evaluate compared to other companies where a lot of the value is brand and IP.  The idea with OXY was it should at least get back to half of what it was worth given how much it was oversold. As for a long term holding of it given the current political environment it’s sex appeal will be limited going forward but the world still needs oil and if oil prices go higher OXY’s financials might improve and we can check in on the P/B ratio again and see what’s going on. 

I did the same kind of analysis for coal stocks such as ARLP and ARCH. Actually ARCH I tested the theory out and bought like 10 shares just to keep track of it and did well on it so I bought more. Then it ebbed and flowed with the COVID news cycle (up on vaccine news, down on lockdown news, etc.) 

PEG ratio serves as good reality check to your hypothesis in looking at a stock. If it’s over 1 you might want to start with a smaller position see how it goes. 

For stocks that are still off their pre-COVID highs a long play could be profitable if they’re fundamental business prospects haven’t changed such as the case with a lot of the tech companies. 

Now that’s not to say fundamentals are all knowing. No fundamental would have given you TSLA or PLUG or any of those. Sometimes you just gotta take a risk and gamble on the people running a company that can disrupt. I drove a Tesla starting last year so I bought Tesla stock, it was literally that stupid simple for me. This is actually my wife’s method of investing, she buys everyday things she uses and never sells them. Pretty sure we have similar returns so your mileage will vary.

There's so many times some big funds have shorted a company, and likely spread misinformation and caused a crisis of confidence that pushed them in to insolvency. And apparently it's fine because ""the market is efficient"".

A company will get in to serious trouble with the SEC if they're in accurate in any way overstating their financials or prospects. But shorts can just blatantly lie over and over again, and it's fine. 

WSBs didn't cause this, they're just the most vocal. What most likely happened is that some other hedge fund spotted the ridiculous short situation with GME, and used sock puppets to get WSB talking about it. Which snowballed when the price kept going up and the shorts just kept digging themselves in deeper.

Really what we should be looking at is how Melvin capital was able to take out such a ridiculous short position. And why other hedgefunds would bail them out (and keep they're shorts open another day) instead of letting them go bust. And why their broker/dealer didn't step in sooner to limit the exposure.

If some idiot retail investor loses his life saving making stupid bets, then it's their own fault. But if a stupid investor has a 100 million dollar hedge fund, then clearly they're too smart and sophisticated to go bankrupt and their losses must be due to market manipulation.

We have to stop acting like a lucky idiot with a lot of money is actually a genius. Melvin capital made a bad bet and stayed in too long and they deserve to go bust. Anyone else who was short and couldn't see this coming deserves to lose they're shirt on this stupid trade too.

This is my theory too. A hedge fund would have people to answer for this and potentially be held accountable. A seemingly organic and disorganized group on reddit does not.

893,OVID,"Kind of a massive question, but I'll put it as concise as possible. 

Depends on the risk: 

Lower risk: larger market cap with upward trajectory in net income and price ratios in favorable territory compared to industry peers. Or I want them to be the industry leader. Macrotrends and LazyFA are good places to run quick checks of financials. Also, macrotrends would need to line up with investment goals (ie, oil companies can be good for a 6 months or 1 year time frame due to COVID recovery, but they're much riskier on a 10- or 20- year time frame.)

Higher risk: smaller market caps, companies that may not be generating profit but are trending in that direction. This requires knowledge of macroeconomic trends, as well as specifics about the business and industry you're looking at. (Meaning, if small healthcare stock A is an investment based on a treatment for pervasive disease Z, make sure that there's no small healthcare company B out there who's about to cure Disease Z, because it would render treatments worthless.)",0.103,0.799,0.098,0.0364
894,CEO,"In general I stick only with sectors and industries that I am familiar with.  That way, I know pretty quickly what to look for in terms what their product or service is, and if its of any quality.

Then I'll look at their ""fundamentals.""  Their revenue, assets, profit, and debt.  I like to see a history of these numbers for the past 5 years, if the company has been around at least that long.  There are more fundamentals, but those are the four I look for.  As you read more and more of these about more and more companies, you'll learn more and more about which details there matter.

Try to find moves the company has made to get better position.  Sourcing deals, partnerships, spinoffs, mergers, anything.  Seeing jumps or drops in stock price history can hint about what time frame in which those events occurred.

Then I take a gander at the competition.

After that, I look at leadership.  You need to know about the people calling the shots, because they determine whether the company is successful, stagnant, or failing.  They determine the vision, direction, and path to their goals.  A company with a great product, lots of profit, tons of assets, and little debt doesn't mean shit to me if their *new* CEO is SpongeBob FuckPants.  Bad leaders can tank good companies.

Conversely, good leadership can save failing companies. 

So find out who's calling the shots, who the CEO is, CTO or whatever, head of research, anyone.  Their career history, the track records of previous companies they've worked for (did they save something or tank it, or just meh?), where they went to school, etc.  It doesn't have to be FBI-class dossiers, but you should be able to name names and say ""They did such and such at X company before, and now they're at Y and building/doing an even better version!""

Fight your own confirmation bias.  Look for potential obstacles for that company, and give them real consideration.  This is why I stick to things that I know - I'll already be familiar with industry trends and common obstacles.  By doing this, I can skip writing many pages about obstacles.

The reason to do any DD is to inform *yourself*.  Once you've read, summarized, sorted and collated all of the relevant info and have a nice 5-pager, you can take a day off, then read the whole thing over again with a clear head.

So find out who's calling the shots, who the CEO is, CTO or whatever, head of research, anyone.  Their career history, the track records of previous companies they've worked for (did they save something or tank it, or just meh?), where they went to school, etc.  It doesn't have to be FBI-class dossiers, but you should be able to name names and say ""They did such and such at X company before, and now they're at Y and building/doing an even better version!""

Fight your own confirmation bias.  Look for potential obstacles for that company, and give them real consideration.  This is why I stick to things that I know - I'll already be familiar with industry trends and common obstacles.  By doing this, I can skip writing many pages about obstacles.

The reason to do any DD is to inform *yourself*.  Once you've read, summarized, sorted and collated all of the relevant info and have a nice 5-pager, you can take a day off, then read the whole thing over again with a clear head.

Then I'll look at their ""fundamentals.""  Their revenue, assets, profit, and debt.  I like to see a history of these numbers for the past 5 years, if the company has been around at least that long.  There are more fundamentals, but those are the four I look for.  As you read more and more of these about more and more companies, you'll learn more and more about which details there matter.

Try to find moves the company has made to get better position.  Sourcing deals, partnerships, spinoffs, mergers, anything.  Seeing jumps or drops in stock price history can hint about what time frame in which those events occurred.

Then I take a gander at the competition.

After that, I look at leadership.  You need to know about the people calling the shots, because they determine whether the company is successful, stagnant, or failing.  They determine the vision, direction, and path to their goals.

No my friend, that represents a fundamental misunderstanding of money entirely. The government makes money as they need it, taxes are just how they take some of it back out of circulation. We aren't on a gold standard anymore, it's all fiat currency. The government poofs numbers, then prints bills (or more often these days just marks up bank accounts directly) to match it.  Taxes are all due in dollars. Our national debts are payable in dollars. Where do the dollars themselves come from though? The Fed. 

MMT is fascinating stuff and I cannot do it justice, but the long and short of it is that a bailout isn't coming from taxes, and even if taxes were created to claw some of that money back to the government, they would not extract all of the money that retail traders are going to make out of the short squeeze. So if they bail out the hedge fund, then try to claw back some of it via capital gains taxes (which there are all kinds of loopholes in by design), the people on the squeeze end still come out marginally better off than they went in.

Looks like you got into GME to take advantage of the short term price fluctuations.

Care to share your thought process on getting in at 300 and out at 340? 

Wouldn't it be too risky a trade as it jumped more than 100% pre-market?

The main issue with the stock is that they released the drug last year during covid, and no-one goes to the doctor to check cholesterol right now. Combined that they expect to burn through \~360 million and have 300 million in cash currently.

They already have deals for Europe and japan, but the rest of world (not USA) deal has been delayed due to ""increased interest"", which combined with the lack of insider buys for past couple months have some wondering about a buyout.

He warned me every week, how about the pandemic is going to be a big, big issue. He sold in February, at highs. Me? I didn't think the pandemic would become as monumental as it did, and held.

Long story short: I sold off what would have been bigger losses in my porfolio ..... though only for the merest, shortest, month!

No reason to keep missing out on silly gains. All strong now. Many people are in the same boat: they are waiting for a correction which might not happen anytime soon to put their money to work. Me?

1121,DD,"Diversification serves many purposes. It serves as a way to minimize risk if you don’t know anything about investing (which is why ETFs are always suggested for people who don’t have a lot of financial knowledge or can’t find the outperforming stocks). Similarity, minimizing risk = wealth preservation, if that’s your goal, then diversification is suited for you. 

If you do your DD, performed all your financial analysis and extremely confident in your pick, then I honestly don’t think having everything in 1 stock is a bad idea. The key factor is that you aren’t risking more than you are willing to lose. Your risk tolerance is a key factor, some people are fine with running 1-5 stocks as their portfolio, some want 5-10, others want 10-20, Etc. If you feel confident in having 1 that’s fine as well, but you need to know the risk of holding one stock. 

For example, 6k to me isn’t a large sum of money to me and I would be fine in investing it all into one company, especially if it was Apple. 

Again, if you aren’t confident in buying individual stocks yourself, there is nothing wrong with going with an ETF. Outperforming the market on a consistent basis is extremely difficult, and having a safer route is better for some.",0.071,0.781,0.148,0.9425

If the 50 day loses support....it heads for the bottom of the 1 year channel at 100. Brutal. CRSP is already beyond correction and in a full blown crash with no signs of stopping. Be wary on this one.",0.155,0.836,0.009,-0.9698
