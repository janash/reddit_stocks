1,GME," Seriously though, my wife confronted me about my obsessive behaviour with my phone over the past year. She actually asked me last month whether I was cheating on her. Started sending me picture quotes of why it was wrong to cheat and such.

I explained to her that I was addicted to trading like a retard and started sending her tons of links to WSB posts. She was pleasantly amused. She was especially happy to see my GME gains over the last couple of months.

Heck I sent her this post just now. I laughed, my wife laughed, and my wife's boyfriend laughed. It was quite good.",AsABrownMan,137,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8xmxi/her_hes_probably_cheating_on_me_him/grkg01e/,0.142,0.651,0.207,0.8586

10,AMC," We won this month. We won last week. We won this week. We won today. Don’t let negative media mess with you. Stay positive!

Their only method to stop us was by “crushing people’s hopes” when we set price targets on specific dates. They hope negative media can scare us away when they manipulate the price target under our “goal”.

I’m glad March 19 is over... 

No more setting specific price targets on specific dates.

AMC is naturally growing regardless 📈

🚨 Here’s why I think we won today:

✅ We still closed over $13.50 (21.5 million shorts must be bought back which isn’t even far from the 25 million we could have received if we closed over $14)

✅ They wasted millions of bullets for a cute little dip (Short shares available went from 4.8 million to 600k + the true borrow rate fee has grown behind the scenes)

✅ Today they exposed themselves to major manipulation

✅ People are reporting them to the SEC to raise awareness of their illegal actions today

✅ The shorting today will backfire in the future

✅ The results of the quadruple witching effect actually kicks in starting next week

✅ Our community is very quick to call out the hedge fund’s tricks. Today the fear some people felt when we closed below $14 was unnecessary and exaggerated. However, posts like this one here are all over the internet by now so that “fear” is already fading away.

This is just the beginning... 😉

The only way they can stop this is by shutting off internet access across the entire world which isn’t ever happening.

Don’t forget GME took 5 months to go from $5 to $482...

AMC is following a similar path (But don’t worry, it won’t take 5 months in this case since AMC has been mainstream since January)

Does this mean it’s the hedge funds desperately trying to keep redditors down? No.

Without HF’s trying to profit from option expiry could the price explode higher? Yes. But the price could also crater in no time flat from paper hands.

34,AMC," I believe today was to get everyone to FUD all weekend and sell regardless if it dips or rises on Monday. 

AMC is a profitable company and you don’t have to be a stock expert to know that. Movie companies have been saving moves especially for when the theaters open. As well as AMC pretty much holds the monopoly on Theaters. Even if there was non of this market manipulation mess AMC would still be a good BET. The only reason they were hurting last year was because of COVID mixed in with not many great movie hits came out the year before. But if you look at 2018 and before they were doing very well. 

Now that going to the movie is big again it should rise regardless.

Now, ask yourself, why would your drub dealer be loading up on supply if word on the street is that everyone and their mother are building drubs now? Maybe they're trying to hoard supply while it's cheap? Seems odd that they've been consistently buying up supply when everyone is saying bonds are super shit (aside from the QE supply).

We don't know exactly how the SLR rule applies to banks' internal plumbing, but... Let's say the primary dealers have a few wrinkles and somehow know that banks **have to** buy up a bunch of treasuries **once the SLR rule is re-implemented**? What's the easiest way to get supply for cheap? Lots of FUD about the SLR rule, plus people fucking hate bonds. Maybe we'll through some hyper-inflation scares in there and BAM bond prices tank across the board.

2) Bond yields (interest rates) significantly rise. This would follow the hyper-inflation and V-Shaped recovery, but I don't think this is a likely scenario. Why? *Mortgage applications have significantly declining for the last 2 months slowing.* **<insert Interest Rates are Too Damn High>.** And banks are still not lending with unemployment this high, so I see interest rates falling more. In this case, stonks should keep going up?

3) The USD rallies. This seems likely to me, given how little money is flowing in the economy right now (people sitting on stimmies & throwing money into the market). It also fits into my understanding of how QE works, so this could just be an after-effect of QE. So, if we rally, it would drive yields down and it stonks would likely drop as well.

76,GME," In isolation, this move would cause inflation because it floods the market with treasury bonds. The treasury bonds become cheaper (more of them) so the yield increases (cheaper bond, same return = higher yield). Since the opportunity cost of money goes up, interests rates go up. 

However, this isn’t the only thing that is happening: the fed is buying bonds and is not releasing anymore. That should offset the excess demand (edit: I meant supply). 

Why you here FUD about increasing interest rates is because banks don’t want to give up their bonds. If they do, they’ll actually have to do their fucking job and lend out money instead of playing the stock market with that cash the bonds free up. So, as retaliation, bond market spikes are occurring to get people on the side of the banks. It’s just smoke and mirrors. 

Also, the whole inflation thing is more FUD or just wrong (even Michael Burry gets it wrong every now and again). Yes, there is a lot more M2 out there but M2 hasn’t mattered for 40 years. What matters is money in the pockets of those who actually spend it, the lower and middle class. You could multiply the wealth of the billionaires by 1000X and it wouldn’t cause inflation except in private islands. 

Unfortunately, the lower and middle class isn’t any better off. The latest annual inflation was in bottom 30% over the past 80years. The economy isn’t good and inflation isn’t going to be a problem anytime soon. 

Finally, the stock market is a massive fucking bubble propped up by banks investing in stocks (instead of doing their fucking job) and retail not having vacations and entertainment to spend money on. When both of those stop, down goes the market.

P.S. GME is a great stock for this scenario. The banks didn’t touch it from what I can see. Also, the gaming market spiked during covid restrictions (people needed something to do) and it’s an addictive activity. So, no reason to believe the gamer market is going to go down. Further, there is the console cycle (couldn’t be better timing) and Ryan Cohen (couldn’t be better for the face of the company).

169,GME," To add: for those with some wrinkles. The reason options are “attractive” to buy is their convexity. You have limited downside and unlimited upside, and before expiration the payoff profile is convex. Higher gamma = higher convexity. The higher the implied volatility of an option, all else equal, the **lower the gamma** is, and the less convex the payoff profile is.

Thus GME (and any other options with >100% ivol) offer a less attractive payoff profile. 
You can think of this in terms of convexity, or the simpler version which is just $$- you pay a lot thus your breakeven are much higher than the strike price. 

Also people are evaluating “breakevens” the wrong way. You should look at breakeven on your option investment (where your pnl is $0) AND breakeven versus just buying stock. This is unusually unattractive for GME haha.

*Example* April 16 $240 calls are about $45 at mid. You could buy these for $4500 and your breakeven is $285. **or** you could buy the stock. $4500 of stock at $200 a share = 22.5 shares. 

April 16th 
•stock $285, options profit = $0, stock profit = $1912.5 (42%)

•Stock $300, options profit = $1500, stock profit = $2250 (+50%)

•Stock $310, options profit = $2500, stock profit = $2475

**So your breakeven on the option is $285 but breakeven vs buying stock is just under $310** 
You can calculate this by 
# shares * (x-share purchase price) = # options * (x - options breakeven) and solving for x
22.5*(x-$200)=100*(x-285)

Every analyst see the fundamental value of the company at less than 30$ ( average price target is 14$ on IBKR - based on 7 equity analysts ) . So clearly nobody who is serious or know what they are doing will argue that the stock is worth 200$ now, so the problem is what will keep this stock up if they hype dies down and the apes get nervous?

213,GME," It will not and I had a thread nuked by some p'tahk of a mod for pointing this out. Could GME hit 10k per share over a long period of time - absolutely.  Could it Moon to 10k+ - in the course of a en epic gamma --> short squeeze?  Not a chance in hell.

Loose 1bn - it's your problem, loose 100bn and it's the feds problem.

See [LTCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management) for precedence on what happens when a hedge fund over-leverages (27 to 1) into a bad position and is facing a margin call of 100bn; with potential of derivative losses exceeding 1 Trillion.  The fed stepped in, liquidated the firm and forced every major bank/counter-party to take and hold the underlying positions.

Also see [Wamu](https://www.thebalance.com/washington-mutual-how-wamu-went-bankrupt-3305620) or [Bear Stearns](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/bear-stearns-collapse.asp) for other examples of how the Fed can and will step into to stop systemic risk.

If GME start's mooning and gets to the point where hedge funds are dumping otherwise unrelated stock to cover margin calls that's where the Fed will step in, and it's probably at a price point not too much north of about $2,500 per share (putting GME's market cap at 125bn)

How can the Fed act if you diamond handed apes don't sell your shares cause you are setting your own price to stick it to the hedgies?  They will force other market makers to offset the shorts at a price the fed decides - which will effectively crash the price back down to pre-moon levels.

During GMEs first run up CNBCs Fast Money (show at noon) ignored it for the first few days. Then once it hit in the 300s I remember Steve Weiss (CIO of Short Hills Capital) said on air that he just bought $45p expiring mid March.

I’m sure he probably sold those as GME tanked but if he held to this point those options are still OTM. A lot of big buyers have a bit of hubris concerning GME and think they know which way it will trade.

For the most part I respect a lot of what Steve Weiss says on that show, he seems to be fairly level headed and more aligned with my mindset than the others, but when he said he was buying puts on GME I immediately thought it was a dumb idea and that he didn’t actually understand the reason for the run up.",HotBoyFF,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9229p/stop_being_robbed_of_call_premium_for_the_mirage/grlz5ci/,0.044,0.899,0.057,0.2657

224,GME," I have four pieces of evidence showing that the short squeeze did in fact happen Friday to Tuesday January 22–26, and that the short interest currently is approx 30%. It’s summarised below with links to relevant sources. 

Du you reject these facts? And what is your evidence that GME has 130% short interest?

1.	The volume during the three days of the short squeeze spiked to an insane almost 200 million shares per day, compared to a normal less than 10 million before January. On Wednesday when the short squeeze was over volume subsided to less than 100 million despite a massive media hype, and it has never been near 200 million shares since. 
2.	Melvin capital admitted to losing about 7 BILLION Dollars in January which is fully sufficient to explain the massive drop in short interest before January 29 (approx 40 million shares)
3.	Short interest peaked at 70M shares in December but dropped to 60M in mid January and 20M by January 29. It is now below 14M.
4.	Cost to borrow GME shares peaked at an insane 84% during the short squeeze in January but has dropped since and is now more than 100x lower at a historical low of 0.5%.

225,GME," Minor correction--you don't need to be exactly right on the price.  The general direction is fine.  Option value goes up with volatility and as the price approaches your strike.

If you bought GME 800c's when the price was $100 and sold when it was $300, you made a TON of money.  You just have to be right about the direction and upcoming volatility.  The option price will be higher if GME does $100 -> $300 -> $250 -> $300 -> $200 than if it slowly climbed gradually from $100 to $200 in the same time period.  People are getting crushed by GME options because the price is already way high due to the volatility.  If you buy options in a stock trading sideways that suddenly shoots up, even if it doesn't shoot up to your strike price, you can easily 5x your money.

Options are a way to leverage change in stock, sort of like a mega leveraged equity with an expiration date.

239,AT," If you want to learn about them, the important parts are: theta (how much it loses every day), IV (if it's high, you better be betting a huge swing to get $ back), and delta (higher the #, the more the option price changes as the stock goes up or down). 


So for SPY, it's like 390 now. Look at the website https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html 

Enter SpY as the ticker, choose a call like 1 month away @ 400 for example. 

Now look at the screenshot - https://imgur.com/AsnoxXK 

This is showing you how every day, the value of this 4/16 SPY 400C goes down by about 6 dollars. If you bought it today, it would cost about $183. Tomorrow, if the stock didnt change AT ALL, it would be worth $177. BUT if Monday, SPY rocketed to 400 in one day, you would have paid $183 and watched as your option went up to $612. 

This is just one example, then you have covered calls/puts and other strategies. Check youtube and you'll find good explainers for this stuff.

It all depends on what you want out of this - actual steady gains? Probably just get stocks, and maybe solid ETFs. Want dividend payments? Research that too.

252,DD," Literally nobody in this comment chain said anything about ""sticking it to the man"". Yes, there are people who feel that way, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the argument you're currently in, so try to keep thing straight if you want to sound credible.

That said, there's nothing wrong with having an opposing viewpoint... however, posting laughing emojis and making declarations isn't a debate strategy. Lots of people have done research and given solid reasons why the price can skyrocket *potentially* beyond $5k. So where's your research and argument to the contrary? Show us your DD, make your case. I can't promise a bunch of apes are going to listen, but *this* ape listens to solid attempts at debate, at least.

255,GME," Just read over your original post. You realize that in order for your income to make up for the loss of IV, *you* have to pay for that exponential growth you're abusing? What do you think the stock will settle at? No matter what you're gonna need at LEAST tens of millions in external revenue because it's not going to continue jumping up and down 1000% for 30 years. 

Your best bet is if it crashes to 1$/share; then at least it only costs 7 million to buy, and you'll have a decent chunk of that from calls (If this somehow goes on for *5 more years* and you truly reinvest everything like you claim, you'll have around 360k before the crash, 35%+0.5% of which sticks around), so around 120k. With your income that is at least semi-feasible.

If it's a vaguely reasonable number instead, let's say $10? You need 70 million, of which (35%+5%)*360k = only 144k will be from stock gain after 5 years. 70 mil-144k is... still 70 mil.

The problem is the strategy of selling calls requires the price to stagnate or decrease forever to make profit, but in that situation the IV doesn't stay high. And even if it DID somehow keep a meme stock volatility gain of 10% forever it would take like 50-60 years to buy GME at 10 bucks a share, and that would make you the best stock picker in the world.",nat20sfail,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8umr9/i_will_own_gamestop_update_mar_19_2021_no_more_rh/grkwp6m/,0.039,0.836,0.124,0.9672

331,GME," I’d like to just add that quadruple bitchin hour showed one thing, buying ridiculous OTM options in GME (like 800c) is not the way. It’s a shitty greedy lottery ticket  that just puts money in MMs pockets, as it is so unlikely to be called that hedgies aren’t required to hedge against it by buying the physical shares. Losing your option virginity on GME is full retard.

Just buy shares for the same amount of money and hold. There’s a realistic return on investment with it and no one but you will make money from it. 

Tldr: GME share good, GME option useless.

This isn’t financial advice though. Be as retarded as you like.",lemonslip,202,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8xhu8/gme_amc_dd_what_we_know_so_far/grkn544/,0.151,0.737,0.112,-0.6369

336,AMC," We won this month. We won last week. We won this week. We won today. Don’t let negative media mess with you. Stay positive!

Their only method to stop us was by “crushing people’s hopes” when we set price targets on specific dates. They hope negative media can scare us away when they manipulate the price target under our “goal”.

I’m glad March 19 is over... 

No more setting specific price targets on specific dates.

AMC is naturally growing regardless 📈

🚨 Here’s why I think we won today:

✅ We still closed over $13.50 (21.5 million shorts must be bought back which isn’t even far from the 25 million we could have received if we closed over $14)

✅ They wasted millions of bullets for a cute little dip (Short shares available went from 4.8 million to 600k + the true borrow rate fee has grown behind the scenes)

✅ Today they exposed themselves to major manipulation

✅ People are reporting them to the SEC to raise awareness of their illegal actions today

✅ The shorting today will backfire in the future

✅ The results of the quadruple witching effect actually kicks in starting next week

✅ Our community is very quick to call out the hedge fund’s tricks. Today the fear some people felt when we closed below $14 was unnecessary and exaggerated. However, posts like this one here are all over the internet by now so that “fear” is already fading away.

This is just the beginning... 😉

The only way they can stop this is by shutting off internet access across the entire world which isn’t ever happening.

Don’t forget GME took 5 months to go from $5 to $482...

AMC is following a similar path (But don’t worry, it won’t take 5 months in this case since AMC has been mainstream since January)

I’m doing my own DD alongside your post and i 
saw that there was also some insider selling listed on simply wall st. *screenshot attached*

Although this might just be the ceo buying these shares from other shareholders. For some reason on this app there isn’t any buying listed, and only selling. maybe the buying just isn’t listed yet?

GME had a process in place to issue shares to strategically raise cash, so I no longer think they'll go bankrupt. They could create even a dubious online games distribution service and WSB would encourage each other to support them, even if it means buying worse games just to protect your investment. Either way, there are people who are able to extract cash from our willingness to hold ""at all cost"", and people will be extracting cash from this situation for as long as it goes on.

389,SEE," Every retard and/or kid with a smartphone being able to trade fucking options is relatively new. I cannot stress how dangerous this is. That was the whole point of this sub lmao.
However, every person should be responsible enough to actually *know* what they're getting themselves into. That's generally speaking, not *just* in trading options. We all know goddamn well that that's *never* been the fucking case, What. So. Ever. 

I'm gonna be completely blunt here so make what you will of it -as a retail trader that trades their own money, I feel personally threatened by the sheer amount of stupidity influx to market trading. Coming into the market, day in day out, you *know* the spread is top game and that the brokers are those who profit off everything, whether it's winning or losing you go through them. They know this shit inside out and in fact everyone who trades, imho, should have spent at least a couple of years working there. So yes, options are a way to hedge larger positions. They're risk management you need to do if you manage a lot of OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY. That's what HeDGiEs do also. But a broker can do this to further profit off the outcome of the market on top of what they make already. They kinda really want/need you to lose too. And they SEE your bets and your assets. Even if they didn't, they could swing by here and see all your positions, apparently. They can literally choose if they want to remain delta or you're just an idiot and you're gonna lose so they won't have to buy anything. Go ahead, buy more way otm calls. They love that shit. Trading options with no intention of ever exercising them is a way to make a quick buck but also stupid and dangerous. Not saying it shouldn't be done. Just need to know what in the fuck you're doing. You can trade options from a mobile app, but you need to understand how options work. You need to understand your OS of choice, you need to understand how that particular app works. You have to *think* about that shit not just blindly deciding something means what you want it to mean.

For you see, to really understand the market you'd have to have been on every side of it. Managing large portfolios, knowing what risk actually means for banks, hedgefunds, everyone. Retail trading should kinda come last lol. When you've been *inside* the machine you know exactly how it operates looking from the outside.

433,GME," Aight I think I'm starting to get what you're saying, but I have a follow up question. When a bulk of these $200 call options were written, GME wasn't believed to hit/maintain levels that would put them ITM, and delta hedging was within their budget. Has that changed now that the price skyrocketed beyond their expectations?

For example, a 4/16 $300 call has a delta now of 0.44. If I were to short that, I'd wanna buy 44 shares to be delta neutral, right? But if two weeks from now, that delta jumps to 0.88, I'd have to buy another 44 shares to stay delta neutral. At normal GME prices, this would be doable for MM, but it's more of a stretch when the price is exorbitantly higher than their expectations. At what point do they skip delta hedging and instead try to keep the price down so that those options don't go ITM? Instead of hedging based around the delta, they try to keep the delta down itself? 

What if instead of dumping a ton of cash into GME that they may not need (cash they'd get from closing other positions, as seen by negative beta), they hedge by keeping price low? 

That all aside, I'm assuming they do delta hedging differently than the simple math I did? Cuz if so, 3/19 $200c closed with a delta of 0.5195 and OI of 3593. Even if they were delta neutral, they'd only have 51.95 shares/option. Assume every call option contract writer did that, and they'd have to buy ~173k shares to make up their shortfall.

439,GME," So they hedge the whole time. Literally their computers are using models to “dynamically hedge” with almost ever penny move in the stock. 
You buy a $300 4/16 call, dealer buys 44 shares. Monday the stock goes up to $210, they buy another share. Tuesday it goes up to $240 they’re buying more shares. 
They’re *losing* money on their short call but they’re *making money* on their long shares. That’s delta neutral. 

If this sounds like the dealers always lose money... remember for GME they are “charging”exorbitant prices. That $300 call has an implied volatility of 278% which is really expensive in option land. The “only way” they lose money is if realized volatility is higher than 278%. If it’s lower they’ll make money (Ie even if stock goes to $350 they won’t necessarily lose money)

They are short *volatility* they aren’t short or long the stock price. 

As for the $200 call... I wrote an addendum to the post but yes, right before 4 PM the ATM options have a delta of just around 50%. A lot of times when you see that kind of sharp movement right before the close it’s dealers capitulating and getting 100% hedged because at 4 pM the delta actually goes to 100% for that $200 call.

442,GME," They're worth approx 14b at today's values, but more than 100% of the shares are outstanding. According to the three link below insiders hold 27% and institutions hold 122%. Retail isn't mentioned. The data for Maverick Capital linked above was only current at 16 Feb too. Even without over 100% of the shares outstanding it's still entirely possible that they own a 6.7% stake (as confirmed by the above link).

443,GME," So basically, they've had to pour crazy amounts of money into the GME options machine since get-go, and now that  the dust has settled, they'll have to lose those shares since the calls are ITM. But since the puts aren't ITM, they've got shares that haven't been called away. 

I guess my last question boils down to this: did they pour enough money into the GME options machine to hedge their shit adequately? Other than the intuitive logic we/you worked through, do we have some tangible way of knowing whether they did? Negative beta seems to suggest it, right? A more calculated version of ""Oh fuck, GME went up again. Sell off another couple AAPL!"" 

If all this is true (and I'd believe that to be the case) then Monday we should see them maybe sell off some of their shares that they don't need for hedging?

488,EDIT," I bet there are a lot of people talking about **other** people putting their stimmy into GME though.

A possibly more accurate test would be to try to have some rudimentary NLP to determine agency. In other words, look for first-person pronouns like ""I"" or ""my"". If you're more familiar with NLP, you could dependency parse to eliminate first-person pronouns in cases like ""my wife's boyfriend"" where it's clear the commenter is not talking about their intentions, but someone else's.

It's totally possible that these media outlets have received data from some firm that's done analysis with these sorts of things in consideration. These aren't very complex NLP tactics, and any form that analyzes anything on internet forums (a field that's been increasingly popular in the past few years) is likely to have taken these types of things into consideration.

tl;dr - you need to find instances of people saying ""I will"" or ""my stimmy"" in order to filter out all the people saying things like ""people are gonna put their stimmy into GME"". Those just build up confirmation bias in your data despite not actually showing any sign of it being a reality.

EDIT - I find it hilarious that Bank of America had a typo that doesn't get corrected in CNBC's article: ""Conservations involving"". MarketWatch throws in a ""[sic]"" and corrects it lmao.

I've never really had anything in common with him, and now being 30 years old, I am so happy that I feel like I've got a great relationship with my father when it was previously more of a ""we love each other because we have to"" kind of thing.

Don't get me wrong, he tells me I'm an idiot on the daily for holding my 100 shares of GME. But this whole situation has really changed my life, not just financially. I feel like I'm a part of something. It doesn't matter whether I'm right or wrong, honestly. I feel very strongly about my decision to hold, and I find it very empowering to be involved in a situation that has a chance to change some things that I don't agree with, and however big or small that chance is matters not. 

I don't even know if I'll ever sell my shares unless I absolutely need to for bills. This has been one of the most exciting adventures of my life, and I can't wait to keep holding.

I don’t think AMC executive board was being evil in wanting more class A shares they obv want the price to go up but they don’t want it to go to the moon necessarily because then people might 💰 out but......So if they had more class shares it would just go up a lot people will just see it’s legitimate value and hold it until they SPLIT possibly

And guess what who cares what they want we have 90% voting power 🤣


I voted no against any class A share increase because I will still hold no matter what because AMC is my OG movie theater 🤘🏻😎

695,AMC," Folks need to understand.

AMC needs dilution to survive. I mean for goodness sakes people, they laid it out in the 10k in December.

They basically said they need massive cash to stay alive, and they were burning 350m a quarter. They received a bail out of 500m due to dilution ontop of taking out another 500m in lines of credit plus selling stock at the height for 308m.

Add it all up, they have 880m in cash as of January 25th and access to 500m in credit 


They explicitly said three things needed to happen to survive this year

1) attendance returning to 80-90%

2) vaccination roll out success in Europe (25% of revenues come from international markets!)

3) studios stop going straight to streaming services. 



I honestly don't think 2/3 of these are going to happen on 2021. Ontop of burning 350m in cash a quarter! Do the math people, the dilution is coming or bankruptcy is coming.

Buy out isn't even an option because the debt ratio is over 120%! On paper amc is worth 8b give or take, a majority of it is in real estate assets, they owe about 12b in liabilities. 

No company would ever buy them for a premium let alone anything for shareholders. Look what Citibank and wells Fargo did to wachiva in 2008 when they bought them out.

736,AMC," AMC needs cash badly.  They are creating cheap shares for both the public and employees.  They probably have about 3-5 months worth of cash right now to pay their bills.  The proposal is to inject cash to stay afloat past those months when the pandemic is supposed to be over.  Sure it'll drop the shares by a lot and assure no rocket to the moon, but it'll at least keep the company from going bankrupt, shares worthless, and allow for a very slow gain for the shareholders once the pandemic is over.

864,GME," Google covered calls. 

An option contract on GME (and most stocks) is a lot of 100 shares. If you’re holding 100+ shares of any stock you can sell a covered call. It’s basically the other end of when you Buy a call. 

When you’re selling a covered call, you’re selling a contract that obligates your to sell all 100 shares of that contract for whatever price you set it to when you originally sell the contract. If the expiration date arrives (or the buyer decides to exercise) and your set price is “in the money” (under current strike price) then it will require you to complete the contract by selling your shares at the set price. 

You make money in GME doing this by selling covered calls every week that expire that week, against the shares you own, and you sell them for a price you hope it doesn’t make it to so it expires “out of the money”. If this happens you get to pocket the contract sale price AND keep your shares. Do this every week and it’s constant flow of profits even when the stock doesn’t go anywhere. And with GME options volatility, they are selling for outrageous prices so people are making a killing doing this.",leadfoot100,10,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m994pb/still_holding_i_like_the_stock_apologies_for_rh/grm824v/,0.04,0.873,0.086,0.7964
865,AAPL," So I understand it quite a bit more, but I guess I’m still unsure how you turn this into serious cash. People say to sell calls for stocks that seem to keep going up like AAPL, but then I’m almost betting against myself. AAPL is at $120 right now. It could easily be $127 within the week so I’d want to sell my call higher than that… but at $128 it’s only 22¢ per contract, so I’m looking at making $22 this week assuming it doesn’t hit $128? That’s some pretty weak sauce, no? The comment above about making 20grand a month… is that just suggesting that I’ve got 10,000 shares so i sell 100 contracts and have to make $50 per contract per week? But that’s suggesting I continually bet that AAPL won’t hit $125? I mean I might be able to run that for like two weeks but pretty soon it’s gonna hit $125 and then my shares are gone. I mean I guess I can then rebuy my shares… I guess I’m still missing how to make consistent money with this.

And why does it have the ability to sell calls below current market price? Wouldn’t someone just buy that as soon as the market opens and then I instantly sell my stocks for less than their worth?",InfectedAssMomFucker,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m994pb/still_holding_i_like_the_stock_apologies_for_rh/grmh5x3/,0.056,0.811,0.133,0.9592

872,GME," Good advice, and I'd do it if I had that much on the line... but it's also capping your gains. 
Let say you sell two $200 calls that expire next Friday 3/26. 

Currently they're ~$33 apiece, so you'd gain ~$6,600 (16.5% of your investment is absurd for the record, but we are in absurd times)

If it closes on 3/26 below $200 (or really $233) you will keep the $6,600 ""premium"" and your shares. 

If it closes on 3/26 above $233, someone will pay you $200 a share, and you still keep the $6,600 --- but $46,600 is the max you will net even if GME hits $100,000 / share.
Once I stop gambling money away on deep out of the money options, I plan to actually move towards this cuz it f'ing prints money, especially in times like this.

Lastly, it really eats into your profit, but if you wanted to hedge against extreme losses, you could also buy something like 2 x $150 puts for ~$12 apiece ($2,400)

Edit: Each put/call represents 100 shares, so 2 calls x 100 is why we keep multiplying things by 200... probably should've said that part earlier. Oh well",espressoforall,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8ses2/had_to_join_the_club_with_200_shares/grkceje/,0.037,0.802,0.162,0.9801

903,ICE," I like ARK, and own a Tesla, but this is so wildly optimistic it’s insane. 

Tesla’s current valuation is already baking in at least a decade of growth. And now to this already extreme valuation, she is saying the bear case is more than double and the expected value 5x in 4 years...

Her model includes something like 30% of revenue from ride hailing. 

It also includes around 80% annual growth in car sales, and good margins. I guess there will be no EV competition? 

As a general point, I fail to understand why EV companies in general will deserve so much higher multiples than ICE companies? Regardless if it’s EV or ICE, car production is a capital intensive business with high competition and relatively low margins - they are not SaaS companies who generate nearly 100% profit for each extra unit sold. 

These astronomical valuations for every EV company do not seem sustainable in the long run.",mcoclegendary,70,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8xlk2/ark_invest_2025_new_price_target_for_tslaget/grkg4lq/,0.078,0.774,0.149,0.9114

WARNING: After you become a Billionaire from selling GME, you generously create a Gorilla Sanctuary in 2022. But a disgraced former CNBC host wanders into your Sanctuary one evening, coked out of his mind, he grabs his bananas and begins some monkey business with your Gorillas.

You wake up fearful for your gorillas safety, as you hear them retardedly screeching for help.

In a mad rush, you slip through the sea of titties and ass, of your many wives and concubines, that usually blanket you while you slumber.

After sprinting to the scene, you have no time to catch your breath, as you are horrified to see a little bald goblin yelling, ""This Sanctuary is  Cramerica now! I used to be Mad Money, but now I am Mad for Monkey!""

As you desperately try to apprehend the former CNBC host, he scratches at your face while staring directly into your soul with his dead eyes, gently imploring you, ""BUY Bear, BUY Bear, I love Bear Stearns, BEARS A BUY!!!""

His words will haunt you forever, but at least you got him to the ground detained and begin to dial 911. But out of the bushes comes a CNBC camera crew. They had filmed the whole thing. And with new state of the art deep fake technology, they set you up!

Replacing the disgraced former CNBC host and his disgusting acts with a digital replica of your likeness.

923,TSLA," The biggest issue I find is that TSLA's current price never ran up due to fundamentals. TSLA was the very first company to absolutely run up in price due to gamma squeeze/short squeeze. If you think about it, very few people actually bought TSLA stock and most just played options, both on WSB and big whales (SoftBank). 

People were literally gaming TSLA and kept buying calls nonstop and caused media hysteria due them being unable to shut up about it for months and months similar to GameStop. With enough time when the price stays flat, boomers wrong and wrong again will eventually throw in the towel and accept it. Now whether they continue to jack up the price I doubt it.

934,TSLA," Internal combustion engines gain efficiency in total production costs and performance capacity every million that are built through improvements in logistics and design as well as raw material procurement.

Once lithium engines are going to be built in the millions similar efficiencies will take place. $25,000 4 door sedans with 500 mile range per charge and over 1 million battery/engine lifetime will be a possibility and that possibility will erase internal combustion engines from transportation the same way internal combustion engines erased horses from transportation. 

Innovations from SpaceX, StarLink, Neuralink, and the Boring company will offer further advantages to Tesla. 


I think TESLA reaching 3000 is possible by 2025 - but if Elon Musk makes his private companies public then funds may diverge from Tesla. 

Efficiency in Tesla batteries will allow for improvements in the energy sector that will be significant. 

And the autonomy pathway for vehicles, while a significant cultural, social, and political development - will also be enough of an economic trigger to change the picture of the whole market the same way the internet changed society.

979,DD," You're still only thinking of weekly options. Other call options could actually be less risky than buying GME outright IMO. Here's a look:

The current stock price of GME is about $200. If you're going to buy 100 shares, that's $20k. Now GME drops to $40 and stays there, so you've lost 80% value- those stocks are now worth $4k total. You've lost $16k.

Now let's say instead you're looking at GME options expiring in 2023 (two years from now). Right now, an ATM call option with that expiry on GME would cost roughly $12k. Let's say you buy the option and the price drops down to $40. Now, you've lost that entire $12k investment because the option is worthless. If you had bought the stock, however, you would have lost an additional $4k.

And that's just looking at ATM call options in 2023. You could even do a $100 call which is going for $14.9k and in that case even if GME dropped to $120 the option would still have value. Alternatively, you could do an OTM call and risk less - a $300 call with 2023 expiry is going for about $10.7k.

What strategy would be best depends on what your investment thesis on GME is, but with all the DD that's been happening on GME it seems most likely that in the next two years either GME will moon and go sky high, or will crash down and stay down.

1000,FOR," I would not say easy.Right now valve has the huge advantage that they offer a steam workshop FOR FREE. There are games where their entire lifespan depends on haveing easy access to mods, assets, map, ...  and valve offers just that. Not to mention that contentcreator for games like Dota use this (or in combination patreon) to make a lot of money from it too.

The other factor is trust. The best example for me would be oculus vs vive.Oculus was first an independent company and now requires you to login via facebook and if you do not merge accounts you and I quote "" can continue using your Oculus account for two years."". With valve being its own platform and not on the stockmarket aka not dependent on investors there are a lot less shady moves.

To make this clear, I am not saying valve never pulled anything shady like for example offering a Doom themed bundle at equal price for all countries when due to restricted lists that ment certain countries did have 6 or more games less in the bundle.

I am saying that valve earned trust by being more pro than anticonsumer on top of offering other services I have yet to see properly implemented by other onlinestores and I would not call that easy to beat.

But you have my upvote good sir/madam because I believe that haveing more competition will be good for the market and users too.

1031,DD," It's been a bit irritating watching people use iborrow to determine the exact volume that gets shorted for each ""short attack"" when there are so many other lenders when I see them write DD.

Some questions I'd like to ask:

What are the other main factors that determine how much the fee is?  

For example price of market security, demand and availability right?  Right now the demand is not high because someone is keeping the price stable at this time, and I'm sure they are worried about adding more fuel into the fire if the short is worried about getting caught in a trap.  Or as shorts, they may need to launch it at a rally or during an attempt at a squeeze, so they are keeping the availability of borrowed shares as high as they can to counter so they don't get margin called with what shorts they have remaining.

If you check the borrow fee for GME history, even when it was shorted at >100% in August 2020, the Borrow rate was only 4% when it was <5 dollars for a good month until it needed to borrow more.  This is much less than the current borrow fee x borrow rate.  The borrow rate x borrow price is 5 times greater right now than when it shorted at >100% in august during a lull period.

There are temporary increases during that time that brought it to 20-60% - likely when the short demand was even more high because they wanted to keep the price down during catalysts, but the % fee does not tell us how short a stock is, we as retailers don't get that information.  But I'm sure the longs whales/institutions have a much better idea than us, and they are still in the game trying to do something.  There is a ton of buying power and manipulation going on in GME, and retailers do not have that level of execution to do it.

Understandably, there are millions of shares still left as some have covered, but there is still a considerable short position - with a lot of other things that need to be taken into account - FTD's, hiding FTD's with OTC options, etc.  Someone is under fire still - Just take that drop from 350 down to 200.  No one overwhelms a buy side with millions of shares in minutes to make money.  If they wanted to make money, they would have sold it slowly over time.  Someone who is under fire wanted to either create panic for others to sell or tank the price because of fear of a Margin call, etc.",tomzaD,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8r4yt/setting_the_record_straight_on_borrow/grkfe89/,0.094,0.847,0.059,-0.9308

1043,SI," Not sure I follow the “under fire” comments. The price to borrow is simply what HFS are willing to pay at any point in time. Supply and demand. Too pricey and they’ll cover. Sure, there is still a large SI. Many stocks have this. The comment about hiding FTDs with options don’t hold up over time especially nit now when the SEC is breathing down the neck of ever BD in this name.

1044,GME, I am not a fan of that theory. Makes little sense to short an ETF which only has a portion of its components invested in GME when there are plenty(millions) of shares in GME to borrow cheaply. My whole point is that too many people are looking to short interest and borrow stats as the MAIN reason to squeeze the stock.

1046,GME," While I agree that most people don’t understand who the biggest lenders of stock are, it’s not that simple. A big reason why fees at etfs and mutual funds are so low is because of securities lending. If you did a side by side comparison of two identical funds one lending their portfolio and the other not lending, there would be a substantial drag on the non lending portfolio. 

When a fund lends its fully disclosed in its prospectus. 99% of people don’t read it. 

Additionally, and here is the real eye opener, anyone who is long GME in a margin account and utilizing that leverage is lending their shares to hedge funds. It’s in the margin agreement we all sign. A BD has the right to “rehypothecate” up to 140% of the margin debit. In this scenario the long holder is not compensated for lending their shares.",Germanicusss,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8r4yt/setting_the_record_straight_on_borrow/grkfk92/,0.031,0.876,0.093,0.8156

1052,PB," I’m not sure institutions are helping to create a short squeeze. There is no doubt they profited handsomely lending out their shares for massive profits but ultimately this has not been a great thing for the PB/Sec lending space. Their main revenue source is to make money on high short balances. If a large percentage of them are hard to borrow all the better. What’s occurring now could be deemed “demand destruction”. Hedges funds have deleveraged massively in the hard to borrow space to avoid a Melvin Capital like event. What’s in it for the lenders is to reap large fees by lending their shares. Lenders clearly would welcome a short squeeze as well because they are ultimately long the stock.
In this context I’m referring to lenders as the beneficial owner or ultimate lender of the stock such as pension fund or mutual fund.

1343,GM," Not trying to be an ass. Just trying to clear confusion and.   There is a major difference between EV (full electric) and PHEV (plug-in hybrid).  

I works for a dealer, I personally sold 10% of all of the CT6 PHEV’s that are in the US.  I leased one myself.  Loved it and I swore I’d never buy “an electric car”.  

Gm has had an EV before, but it was 1996-1999…. Nothing recent.  

GM has surpassed Tesla in self driving and battery tech.  There will be problems with every car for every manufacture but I really feel confident about this new lineup.  I can’t wait.

With or without a squeeze, GME will do fine, you just have to have patience because slow cooking is how you make money in the stock markets. If a squeeze happens, and the possibility looks high, then we all win big.  

Even if your average is high, you can fix it. I got in GME at $328, but I held and bought the dips. I got my average down to $87 on my other account at one point. Keep cash available for opportunities like that and you can't lose. Stay patient because instant gratification will kick your ass in life. Fuck easy!
