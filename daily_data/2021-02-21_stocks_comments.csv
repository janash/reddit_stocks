1,ATH," Incredible stuff as always, /u/bigbear0083! Thanks for all your work!

This coming week, I'm hoping to see the market pull back a little bit more from ATH, with my eyes on a number of dividend and consumer stocks. My portfolio, as always, is overweight in high-growth tech, so I'm hunting for some better diversification. I have fantasies of seeing WMT under $137, or WBA in the mid-$40s. 

I'm also hoping to see good earnings numbers from Salesforce. I bought the dip on that stock after their Slack purchase (doing most of my buying on the day of the Capitol riot, if I'm to be honest). I think CRM under $220 was a great value, but we shall see.",vacalicious,113,/r/stocks/comments/low4ch/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/go81lri/,0.033,0.838,0.128,0.8217

5,TSLA," What are y'all's thoughts on fake meat? The more I think of it the more I convince myself it's the future. Vegan/vegetarian is exploding everywhere I look. Can't get away from it. Vegan restaurants (pre-covid) are doing well and even major fast food has put it on their menus in the last couple years. This isn't going away and I think this is a lot like picking TSLA 10 years ago. In fact, I'd guess it almost completely replaces real meat within 50 years, if not sooner. The real die hards are the boomers and once they die off it will dominate the market. I haven't tasted it myself (don't have it where I am) but I've heard enough people say that it's getting very close to real meat in taste and texture. Plus, while they are making fake hamburger now with beans and soy, the real meat killer will be lab-grown meat. ""Real"" meat but not from living animals. That's where things become hazy for me.

38,AZEK," I'm bullish on financials, but, in the short term, having trouble seeing why everybody is excited about WFC. I'm a bit old-fashioned and use old simple charts, featuring MACD and stochastics. For WFC, (3-month), the MACD spread looks to pull the 12 period down to the 26 (in other words, stock is expensive at current level), and the stochastics are flashing ""SELL"" (although, granted, they've been pegged at a high level for a while). Stock may continue to meander up a little, but it looks poised more for a correction than a break-out up. Longer term, financials are probably a good place to be. But this week seems unlikely to be a buy entry point for WFC. Especially given the market's latest tendency to punish stocks for positive quarterly reports

42,ON," Hmmmm. Right. I get it...

So, at any point time I have 75% invested.  

What that REALLY means is that I hold 25% of my play portfolio aside for dips/opportunities/GameStop/whatever. 

When an opportunity pops up, that 25% is ON IT!!  

But after a few days, weeks, months, as appropriate, I kinda go “is this the opportunity, or is it another investment??”  (Usually a week or two for me, but your threshold is all about you.)

It’s totally legit, (imho), to sell off an entirely different position to get the 25% back. But, yeah, the bottom line is to have 25% sitting in cash at any point in time to “buy the dip”. 

Also, I like to work with some leveraged (volatile) ETFs. So if I’m long on a particular ETF and it tanks - that 25% mentioned above buys in.  But I program an auto-sell at a particular profit.

54,GME," When you have both a long term strategy and a short term strategy, and there's a gap when selling your short term stocks and deciding which long term stocks to put your money back into, and a dip just happen, Voilà, there's your chance to buy into the ones you have been looking forward to buy for long term, and you pull the trigger.

That doesn't quite follow one's calculation, and doesn't happen quite often, both selling on short term stocks with a gain, and getting back on with a long term growing momentum, are random.

It does happen to me just last week, I was emotionally swing by the market with the GME incident, dragging down all my short term investments, and then I panic sold with a profit. Then I got back in to the same short term investments with some change for long term investment, so I put it right away to work, not at the dip.

And then I still have some change left either use as cash bonus to my original emergency fund, or to enter the market again, but I haven't decided yet which stocks I want to put my money into, I have been grouping a few stocks into the must buy for months already, and since my long term portfolios were fully invested already, I didn't have the fund to put into any of those, and such a dip finally made my spare changes to get to work, the group of stocks I were able to buy at that exact amount of what I have.

55,NOW," Well what you SHOULD be doing normally is dollar cross averaging. So if you have 1000 dollars every month to invest, you invest 1000 dollars every month no matter WHAT the market does.

NOW, if the market dips, it might be wise to temporarily ""throttle up"". Maybe you invest 1500 a month instead of 1000. You can temporarily cut back on drinking/eating out etc. to take advantage of the dip.

Then when the dip is over, you throttle back down to 1000/month.

I did some of my own digging into which parts of the supply chain were choked and they all led to Asia, either $TSM and Samsung being unable to meet demand or mainland China fabs being off limits to US-based buyers since the Trump trade war. 

$ON does have an interesting US-domestic fab footprint based on what looks like a habit of scooping up obsolete IT sector fabs which formerly produced IBM Power CPUs and Freescale/Motorola before that, but looking at $ON’s product and services offerings they target lower sophistication applications than what you’d expect from the likes of TSMC or Global Foundries (which isn’t going to IPO till 2022). 

$ON could maybe find itself in a position to respond to a US strategic defense push to regain competitiveness in the US domestic chip fab business, but that would be something that takes years to come to fruition. If you’re looking to bet long on $ON, sure, there’s a kernel of something there to pin your hopes to. Not a slam dunk IMO, though. 

As for this current silicon supply crunch, there’s probably more near-term action to be had shorting the downstream firms like automakers and their direct suppliers who are being forced to shutter plants and will be downgrading their guidance due to not being able to ship product, especially into a market about to be frothing with stimulus cash and post-COVID hopium.

There’s plenty of reason to be bullish on the whole semiconductor sector long term, just because the demand across the sector is only going up.

Agreed. 

>	They are a semiconductor design company that outputs their designs to other semiconductor foundries.

Completely incorrect. Both TI and Micron have several of their own chip fabs, but for thing like analog (TI) and DRAM & NAND (Micron). That’s why they have nothing to do with the supply crisis, not for any of the reasons you list. 

>	ON is a much bigger semiconductor foundry so will be supplying all of the demand.

LOL no. $ON does not necessarily have the capability to swoop in and produce whatever Infineon had contracted TSMC to fab. They can certainly work toward that, but it will take years. 

>	TI and Micro will be the ones demanding (asking for others to fabricate their designs), in other words spiraling downward, the same way Qualcomm just reported super poor earnings because they are a chip designer, not manufacturer.

TI and Micron are not dependent on third party chip fabs. They are just first party manufacturers with products adjacent to the ones impacted by this shortage. The automotive industry really should have been diversifying its upstream chip suppliers, if only because cars of all things do not really benefit from being on the latest node the way the Qualcomms, Apples, AMDs, and Nvidias of the world do.

I can see an argument to being long $ON based on their niche in the fab space seeing increased demand and perhaps a boost from a US government initiative to revitalize domestic semiconductor manufacturing for defense reasons, but the idea that there’s a quick buck to be made buying $ON (or any other semiconductor sector stock) in reaction to this news about Ford and GM idling plants due to lack of chips is silly.",ogminlo,1,/r/stocks/comments/lol05g/major_silicon_shortageis_there_a_play_here/go9mwdx/,0.092,0.783,0.125,0.9038

Their phones don't need a fast CPU to be faster than the competition, but that's been true for a decade just bc of Android's flaws not bc they innovated so well.  They're a very successful company bc the price vs cost is so staggering.  I'm probably just biased and grumpy  but to me their moves are all money not innovation.  One USB c port on a laptop.

I am a new investor and I a have just been wondering, the stocks that you have listed all seem to have already shot up 2x - 3x within 6 months.   


For individuals who are looking to buy some of the listed ones, wouldn't that be unsafe as its already gone up so much?  


I really like the look of DMTK and I will be investing into them after reading up about them. So, I assume the other companies are similar? Shot up a lot but they have so much potential in the future (releasing a ground breaking product, getting patents etc) that it could only be the beginning?  


I hope this makes sense, just trying to learn as stocks that are already 2x higher then 5 months ago seem to worry me.

Initially I could tell they’ve had 4 straight quarters of earnings beat and reported their best quarter at $4.62 per share. $1.62 above expected EPS. The stock immediately dropped in price and by Friday was down nearly 27%. All of this because they failed to provide guidance going forward on expected earnings due to covid-19. It was a conservative position to take, and many companies have done it during the last year. Let that sink in for a second. Records profits and the stock falls by 27%. So I dug deeper. Since April of 2014, STMP has beaten every single expected EPS. That’s incredible. I wanted to know the full scope of their business. So after further research learned they’ve been expanding their footprint by acquiring other companies involved in shipping and shipping management. Companies include, ShipStation, ShipWorks, Endicia, ShippingEasy and MetaPak Ltd. They’ve been doing this while maintaining record profits and beating expected eps every quarter since 2014.

Or that CFO needs to refit his yacht because last weeks banger destroyed all the leather on board, and someone threw up on the vintage teakwood deck?

334,BABA," Yep, fair points all around.  I myself have never actually used Ali and like the reliability of Amazon.  There's no beating that, at least for the time being.

What I do see is people using Ali as a low-cost alternative, and in countries where wealth is not as abundant in the US they are willing to take the risk of bummer transactions because they simply don't want to or can't pay for Amazon.

This is totally anecdotal, but since I live in Europe (I'm from US) I like taking into account these anecdotal perspectives along with good DD.  I feel I see things that people back home don't see sometimes.

Amazon is here obviously, in southern Europe, but I do see Ali catching on a lot more than back home.  Not sure how it would compare in northern Europe.  But southern Europe is reflective of poorer countries in general, which is a pretty big market that Amazon may not be tapping effectively.  Lots of room for growth there, too.  

BABA is here to stay IMO.  I'm only hesitant to YOLO because of China, unfortunately.  I don't think it will matter but it's still too much of a gamble to go all-in at the moment.

336,IMO," Yep, fair points all around.  I myself have never actually used Ali and like the reliability of Amazon.  There's no beating that, at least for the time being.

What I do see is people using Ali as a low-cost alternative, and in countries where wealth is not as abundant in the US they are willing to take the risk of bummer transactions because they simply don't want to or can't pay for Amazon.

This is totally anecdotal, but since I live in Europe (I'm from US) I like taking into account these anecdotal perspectives along with good DD.  I feel I see things that people back home don't see sometimes.

Amazon is here obviously, in southern Europe, but I do see Ali catching on a lot more than back home.  Not sure how it would compare in northern Europe.  But southern Europe is reflective of poorer countries in general, which is a pretty big market that Amazon may not be tapping effectively.  Lots of room for growth there, too.

347,IMO," IMO, gains management is as important as risk management. So many people complain about getting stopped out of a stock, as if they think the only way to exit a trade is with a static stop loss.

If I buy a stock with the intent of holding on for a long period of time, I let it ride. But if I have a shorter timeframe with a potentially high reward stock, I set a target price where I take a certain number of shares (ideally 50% once it doubles) off the table with a limit sell trade. I then set a one-cancels-the-other trade with a sell limit on one side and a trailing stop on the other. I can participate in future upside while protecting some gains to the downside.

Note this would not be the answer for all stocks, but the holdings look to be high-growth with plenty of room to run.  The sale of 20% is to lock in some profits, giving you an opportunity to buy more for less and in the event of a market correction that takes this with it.",IntrepidFromDC,1,/r/stocks/comments/loozhj/should_i_take_profits_if_the_stock_jumps_20_right/go8a70v/,0.028,0.841,0.13,0.9036
351,IMO," I'm both a trader and an investor, and tend to keep the activities relatively separate. The only sin I've committed is panic selling.

Standard caveats apply: I'm not an investor, this is not financial advice, take it as entertainment.

With that said: as an investor, you need to know \*why\* it went up 20%, because you need to know if it went up 20% because of your investment thesis or because of something else. If it went up because of something else, sell it. If it went up 20% because of your investment thesis, keep it, provided that your investment thesis isn't complete.   


Here are a few examples from my investments:

* Cloudflare went 20% up because of a new product launch. My investment thesis: Cloudflare means that you're betting on the internet and the growth of the internet. A new product launch means a manifestation of how the internet could be used in different ways. So keep the stock.
* Tesla goes up because of pure hype to 10x. Sell. My investment thesis: people are wrong about Elon Musk. Most companies don't innovate because they either lazy or get stifled by bureaucracy. Elon doesn't have this and keeps things simple. People don't believe him, and therefore Tesla's price is depressed (my opinions/thesis obviously). Now, however, the stock is hyped, and has lost all connection to any fundamental form of value. To an extent my investment thesis is fulfilled a bit (a new group started believing in Tesla), to a much bigger extent the market is irrational and I have to reassess how my investment thesis will hold up against this new environment. My revised thesis is: I have no clue what is happening. So I sell everything.
* Pfizer goes down 15%. Whatever, they give 4% dividend, which is why I bought them.
* Takeaway merges (or buys?) Grubhub and goes back to previous price levels. Buy extra, since my investment thesis was that Takeaway was underappreciated since IMO they were the most likely European candidate to expand to the US (and I believe there's value in that).
* Takeaway gets a higher price level, because the market has turned around and think it's pretty good that they merged/bought Grubhub. Sell everything, my investment thesis is complete. Upon reassessing of my investment thesis, I couldn't tell how they would perform in the American market with Grubhub on their side, since I don't know Grubhub well enough.",Radiant-Experience21,1,/r/stocks/comments/loozhj/should_i_take_profits_if_the_stock_jumps_20_right/go8a8d0/,0.071,0.873,0.056,-0.7435

Unless you strongly think that OBSV is going to go to like $7 per share or something you should be selling.

When prices inflate like crazy, it's usually because of a bubble or the result of a market correction. If you can't prove the latter, assume the former.

413,IBM," Tl;dr 5G and physical server providers are a good play IMO, just based on personal industry experience.

I have no tickers, but I will say a lot of the compute work probably won’t be done on the device itself, for smaller devices like wearables, for battery/space reasons. It will, IMO, be done on mobile edge.

So like, the camera on your device will capture video frames, and send it to a server on the “edge” of a carrier network, to do image recognition. Mobile edge just means the server is close to the location you’re at and can bypass much of the carrier network to decrease latency.

That means carriers will have a big hand, b/c every device will need to have an internet connection. And providers of large compute servers, Microsoft azure, prob IBM, etc. will also have a large share. Hardware providers for 5G and beyond (like Ericsson) are a good idea IMO as well.

AI can be used for data analytics, but there's many ways to analyze data that don't require AI, and there's many applications of AI beyond data analysis.

This is the best I’ve ever done having the conviction to average down during a falling market, because we all know now what followed.

594,AMAT," For UMC, I picked up 200 Apr 21 $65c contracts. I've contemplated picking up ON, TSM, and AMAT to get in on the semiconductor play but ultimately picked up UMC because the options were well priced and would be the most profitable should there be upward movement. 

I got my contracts on 2/12, a day before it rallied up pre-market and then started to dip down along with the rest of the market which is why I'm currently in the red. However, I expect everything to bounce back so I'm not worried.

Also, I believe when semiconductors start rallying, new investors will probably pick it because of its cheap price. Also, despite being cheapest, it also experienced the greatest price growth and I believe it will continue to experience more growth because it's so cheap. I think cheaper stocks have a better chance of experiencing higher upticks IMO.

608,FSLY," Let me put this in perspective which may make more sense (or not depending on your view)

FSLY is expected to have earnings of 381.25 Million in 2021 (avg. estimate). It currently has a mktcap of 9.15B. That means P/S ratio for 2021 is 24. Also growth rate for revenue is 31.01% from 2020 to estimated 2021

Now lets look at everyone's darling (especially on reddit) PLTR.

PLTR has an estimated revenue of 1.48B for 2021 (average) and currently a mktcap of 54.46B. This will make PLTR P/S for 2021 of 36.79. Interestingly PLTR has a similar estimated revenue growth rate as FSLY at 35% (so a bit more).

Goldman just upgraded PLTR saying a company that has >30% growth rate can have a P/S of 44. I think that's a bit nuts and again shows valuations don't matter much nowadays but this is what they said.

So comparing the 2 companies that have very similar growth rates for 2021, FSLY is actually a pretty cheap stock (I can't believe I am saying this) when compared to PLTR.

However PLTR is much more of a meme stock than FSLY at the moment so it automatically is accepted for a higher valuation especially if you see a new post here almost daily saying how great the stock is.

It seems (very) unlikely anything in your portfolio is going to have the sort of run up that balances the percentage PLUG currently takes up in your portfolio, let alone the multiple positions having this kind of growth. Some of them could well have a solid run up (eg PLTR hopefully, as I’m in myself; also in DIS and see a bright future), but you’d still be needing to rebalance.

639,EV," No, not unless you want to be on margin.

If Extrensic Value (EV) is still high because your far away from expiration and implied volatility is higher than you started when buying the call, then you are better off selling to close because you get the EV + IV (stock price - strike price), times 100 per call/contract. This is because you're selling the contract not the shares, so you have the ability to make back the cost of the contract and then some.

If you exercise the option instead, you are buying the shares at the strike price (potentially on margin) and then selling them. However, you forfeit EV (basically the cost of the contract) and only gain the Intrinsic Value (the difference between the strike price and stock price) because you are selling the shares but not the contract (EV + IV). However, you can always hold the stock and wait for it to go up, but you would probably be better off just buying the shares directly because you lost EV.

That doesnt take away anything...look how long it took Bezos to turn profitable all whilehe considered one of the worlds richest leading an unprofitable company. Same with Tesla etc.

What bothers me about Cohen and GME leadership is how passive they have been. I know they cant manipulate the market but they could have by now said something fair and within reason to protect their brand and give confidence to their loyal supporters worldwide.

Something so easily as and this isnt perfect but something like..""we understand the media attention surrounding our company and would like to state that while we are turning this company around we hope that financial institutions have not illegally or deliberately manipulated our brand and our market.

683,GME," I will take both sides of the argument.

BestBuy tried to create niche spaces in their stores. At one time they dedciated an entire closed off area for musical equipment and instruments. That failed. They tried other specialized areas...like Magnolia and even high end kitchen..those footprints are decreasing each day and now you cant tell the difference. They tried electrical motorcycles, needless to say that failed too. What did work for them was partnering with product companies directly like Samsung, Apple and Microsoft, giving them dedicated space and charging them rent and getting their foot traffic. Best Buy was also at a time where their cash positions sustained them while competitors like Radio shack Circuit city etc couldnt survive the shift to ecommerce. 

Bestbuy even tried mini stores in malls etc and those failed too. While I cant see Best Buy succeeding in having dedicated gamer areas, there is potential partnership opportunities for GME to utilize and leverage BestBuys traffic?

Regarding GME they won't survive by being just a gaming center or shifting to just online. They will have to increase their business lines and become more of an entertainment epicenter brand and start partnering with alot more influencer brands. I think the biggest threat to GME is Netflix or Amazon. They already shifted to Entertainment as a Service and they can definitely create gaming communities and platforms deliver gaming too if they have not already.

691,CC," You mention radio shack, but circuit city would be a better example and one I lived through. Worked there while I was in college, and experienced it's fall first hand. It went from being the #2 electronics retail store behind best buy to bankrupt in the 4yrs I worked there. At the time, my analysis from the ground floor was CC did not evolve to meet the new marketplace. Walmart had entered the electronics space in a huge way and Amazon was also taking off, but CC didn't change to meet these new competitors. Best buy had the bigger name recognition, so circuit city is the one that lost more business to the new competition.

I remember when I realized the situation was bad was when halo 3 launched. It was one of the biggest video game launches until then, and everywhere was sold out. I would have people call very sheepishly to say ""yeah I know you guys are probably out, but just wanted to check if you have any copies of halo 3..."", And I'd turn around to look at the literal wall full of copies we had sitting there and let them know they might want to stop by. It's when I realized that so few people were even considering our store for gaming.


All this to say, that in the last decade since then even though gamestop has tried many things to keep afloat, I just don't see them competing with all the big box stores and e-commerce sites that now sell games.",y2jasper,2,/r/stocks/comments/lp0lo7/gamestop_vs_bestbuy/go91r00/,0.055,0.834,0.111,0.9366

I won't take anything away from Bezos BUT his retail business is still a BIG LOSER. If not for their other innovations, which were only enabled by their retail business, they would have never turned a profit.   


I totally understand the idea of rapid growth to dominate an industry but at some point you need to make a profit. Guys like AirB&B or Uber have been private for so many years and arguably already should have reached some market leader mature status. If they aren't profitable now then it's not clear how they will get there or when. Which is why I'd never invest in those. If they were IPOing 5 years earlier, I'd be in, but these valuations now exist only to give the original shareholders an exit. IPOs use to be about raising capital so the business could grow or accomplish some added value... Uber IPOs and continues to lose money.

697,LADR," * SJM (yes schmucker, that boring af company that makes the jelly). Check the charts. It's surprisingly good for swing trading on both short and medium term and is a very stable company. It's also entirely recession proof which for people worried about a bubble, not a bad place to trade on. It has ridiculously strong supports at $100 from what I can tell, but you may have to wait months and months to get anywhere close to that, and another few months for it to jump back to the 110's. I'm mainly waiting on this one to fall into the 100's before I buy it. Definitely an email alert kind of stock. It also shot up a ton(to $130!!!)during the gamestop fiasco that brought the general markets down a bit, and to 120 in April 2020. That to me screams a company that people flock to when there's uncertainty in the market. Unfortunately it also has times where it does basically nothing for 5 months before spiking 15%. If there was ever a company to go balls deep on margin at a good price it's this one, but be prepared to wait and probs sell CCs on it at your exit point in the meantime to fight margin interest and make passive income. I played with it a little for some modest gains, but I'm waiting for a bigger drop.

* Mastercard is the one I've made the most money on. Getting in in the mid to late 20's and selling at the low 40's is basically free money as far as I'm concerned. Visa can theoretically be traded the same but I dunno I like MasterCards volatility better

* Amazon is decent but I haven't made anything off it. It's honestly kind of boring for swing trading imo, but I won't say it's bad. Never a bad long hold either it's friggin Amazon after all.

* Shopify if you're feeling adventurous

* Facebook's really good for swing trading, but I only just entered it recently. 261 is a steal and I got it on Friday. Planning to sell at 275 but I could just as easily wait a month or two for 285. We'll see what happens I guess.

* LADR, another boring but potentially very profitable company. It's on an upward trend like many recovery stocks, and it has dips all the time you can capitalize on. I just sold it this week from 10(gobbled that shit up when it dropped 6% in a day so it doesn't even show up on the dailies :D) to 10.55 for some pretty solid gains in like a week. Had I waited I'd have been able to sell at 10.85, but I take my profits when I can. SPG is another good REIT but it's significantly harder to predict as a swing and is better as a long hold.

Microsoft and apple are also great for swing trading. But I haven't done them yet and they're in kind of a weird price discovery phase right now after earnings so it's kind of making them harder to model. Maybe in the future.

At the end of the first period, XYZ is up 5% and 3 mo LIBOR is 1%. Therefore Party A owes 5% on the notional, Party B owes 4% (3 + 1).

756,IMO," As great as this sounds, it's not really that simple IMO.

What you're saying is that ""a lot of people think we're in a bubble, therefore we're not."" So if people then take that as evidence that we're *not* in a bubble, then really we don't actually think we're in a bubble, right? Which would then contradict your original statement.  See the issue here?

People predicted the early 2000s housing bubble as well.  I defer to our friend Wikipedia:

>Although an economic bubble is difficult to identify except in hindsight, numerous economic and cultural factors led several economists (especially in late 2004 and early 2005) to argue that a housing bubble existed in the U.S.  Dean Baker identified the bubble in August 2002, thereafter repeatedly warning of its nature and depth, and the political reasons it was being ignored. Prior to that, Robert Prechter wrote about it extensively as did Professor Shiller in his original publication of Irrational Exuberance in the year 2000.  
>  
>The burst of the housing bubble was predicted by a handful of political and economic analysts, such as Jeffery Robert Hunn.

[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_housing_bubble#Identification).

You may be right.  But the fact that people are so openly dismissive of it is exactly what makes me fearful.  You could argue that the housing bubble wasn't like what's going on today or whatever.  That's fine.  No two bubbles are exactly the same.  The future is always uncertain.  Plus, let's remember that we *learned* (hopefully) from the events of 2008.  People are more skeptical for a reason these days.  It doesn't mean they're wrong.

So that's why I'm being cautious.  I'm still investing, but I'm investing strategically and safely, with limited risk.  If I had gotten in 5 years ago, I may have been singing a different tune.  But right now I'm a bit cautious.

Anyone who says ""we are"" or ""we aren't"" doesn't have a clue. The best answer, IMO, is maybe, maybe not.

771,KO," What’s your time horizon? There are 2 trade offs; 
1. Chose a high paying dividend today; this implies low growth potential with implies low revenue growth with then implies low dividend growth potential. So high dividend today but not much more tomorrow 
Ex: oil, energy, KO, boomer stocks basically 

2. Chose a low dividend paying growth company; a company that has a low yield today but reinvests most capital, implying high growth, implying high revenue growth, implying high dividend growth. So in 5+ years this could be a best, especially if the share price accrued nicely thanks to the natural growth.
Ex: Apple, Microsoft, discruptive insurance/healthcare etc.

797,PLTR," I was investing for 20 years before I started trading options. Honestly, I wish I would have started sooner. 

I would recommend you start boring - put everything into an S&P 500 index fund via your work 401k and an IRA. You should be maxing those each year before you do too much with stocks and options. 

Take your time to study stock investing. Don’t worry about options initially. 

Get in the habit of following the markets. Closely follow a few companies you believe in. Learn to read financial statements. Read earnings call transcripts. Pay attention to how events in the economy, the business, etc move the share price. 

Open a paper trading account on Think or Swim (Ameritrade) and open some positions so you can test your trading skills without risking any real money. 

Once you’re comfortable with your ability to identify good long term investments, begin to open real positions in stocks that you believe will provide long term value. 

Read up on Covered Calls & Cash Secured Puts - these should be the only options you trade initially, possibly ever. I probably wouldn’t mess with options for 3-5 years if you’re brand new to investing. Make sure you can pick good stocks first. 

Always do your own due diligence. While I strongly believe in PLTR, don’t take my word for it.

803,PLTR," I'm actually holding a similar position, 30C 2/26. Two things I'd encourage you to keep in mind:

1. You DONT need to hold to expiry. In fact, I've never held to expiry a single time. As the price rises (hopefully), the contract value will too and you should sell when you think PLTR stock itself is at your price target. Think of it this way. Let's say PLTR goes up to 34. You'll make a lot of money as the price of your calls goes up. However, if by Friday, it doesn't cross 35, your contract goes to zero, regardless of how close the price got to 35. Get out and take profits when you feel it's appropriate I always like to sell half my position when it hits my first price target (31 int his case, for me), then hold the rest with a 10% stop loss until my next target (35).
2. In the future, do NOT buy options just because they're cheap. I'm guessing you bought the 35C because they'd only put you down 100. It may work out in this case as you probably got in at a good time (kudos to you on that) but in general, buying options for the sake of them when they're cheap is almost just like throwing money away, unless you have a solid thesis.

Hope this helps! There's always a lot of negativity towards newer traders and I'm sorry for any that you may have faced. Best of luck!",hotpieazorahai,1,/r/stocks/comments/lojofg/pltr_options/go9q888/,0.034,0.844,0.122,0.9742

813,DD," Cant comment on this particular portfolio but some general thoughts on this. I've been holding ICLN and TAN since mid last year and have no intention of selling even with this pullback. Im bullish on renewables over the next 10 years so one, two months of red isn't going to give me cold feet. 

Some thoughts on your situation here. 

Why did you buy this in the first place? Are you looking for a short term pump and sell or did you buy for something long term as your DD came out to this is a good bet? 

When a fund gains value over time, its not going to be a straight line up. A pullback on renewables was always going to happen given the huge rises over the last 8 months or so. Its unfortunate that you bought in just before a pullback but anyone who has invested longer than a year or two will tell you this happens from time to time. 

To your other comment- If you are going to sell now at a loss, why bother keeping any money in it at all? Either you think ill grow so don't touch it or sell it all to buy something better. Leaving a bit in just in case it goes up again makes little sense as a strategy. Plus then if it does go up, you'll just kick yourself and have regrets for not holding the rest. 

On the day trading question- my only view on this is that trading platforms love it as you'll be paying commissions every time (even commission free there's still a cost with spreads, poor prices etc). Buy and hold doesn't make them much money so they love to portray day trading as the thing to do. I've seen so many videos and ads showing this a get rick quick but in reality you'll need a very detailed strategy mapped out probably using formulas and more advanced features of your trading platform. If you are really keen on this, I'd seriously switch to a paper account for a few months and practice.  Just my 2 cents on this as someone who doesn't day trade, so take this opinion with a pinch of salt.",elephantbaboon,1,/r/stocks/comments/lou1ic/etoro_copyportfolio_fell_quite_hard_and_im/go7rxir/,0.066,0.829,0.105,0.9584
814,DD," Hmm the problem with the green energy /ev play is it ran a lot. Personally I find jumping in late is a recipe for disaster sometimes you just miss it and that’s ok. Outside of a bit of arkk exposure I did. There’s always another opportunity or sometimes a dip in that specific sector. That said if your DD says it looks good and the numbers of the companies in that portfolio look good to you that drop is nothing. If 6% scares you it sounds like you don’t have conviction, that should be a buying opportunity. If you listed the companies it would be easier for people to answer.

815,OXY," It is similar to a stock and can be purchased or sold. But you also have an option to execute the warrant for a stock purchase and a set price. Example. OXY had warrants issued to shareholders last fall. One warrant for ever eight shares held. These warrants had an initial value of $5. It was to entice shareholders to carry OXY. These warrants give the holder the right to buy one share of OXY for $23, until 2026. Not a great deal when they were issued and OXY was as $9. I bought every warrant I could and have a cost average under $3. Now that OXY hit $23 I can exercise the warrants and buy shares at $23 regardless of actual price. So each share would be my warrant price plus the $23, total $26.5 regardless of actual trade price. As I expect OXY to hit $50+ I see this as a great investment. However if OXY had never hit $23 again my investment would have expired worthless in 2026. It's very similar to options / calls.

816,IMO," IMO, it’s not worth it. What you’re describing is called a margin call. The time between the trade and the funds being needed to cover it depends on the platform/broker you are using. If anything does get hung up along the way you will be penalized and if it happens more than once you could lose your ability to trade for a certain period of time (for RH users this kind of thing often comes with a 90 day penalty). This also kind of goes with my “don’t trade first thing in the morning/at the start of the market” policy because that is when stocks are most turbulent. Start the transfer and check on it mid-day throughout the week and then buy the stocks when the money is available. I have never waited so long for funds to transfer that I felt like I had really missed out on a stock. Sure, it may go up a bit, but then you also learn to keep some liquid cash in your account. It also sounds like your account may be new, I find that the longer I have an account the faster deposits seem to go through.",Bone-of-Contention,1,/r/stocks/comments/low22k/stocks_and_available_funds/go8mgfa/,0.026,0.923,0.051,0.6021

818,TFSA," I think OP needs to understand there are very different forms of investing in the stock market. I think they look at some of the posts on here and assume everyone is a wanna be day-trader making big moves, jumping from one stock to another chasing the one quick score and that just simply isn’t the case. 

If you’re patient and not greedy, if you’re portfolio is well-balanced and you don’t get caught in stupid hype trends then you will always win. Why? Because stocks like apple, Microsoft, amazon etc will ALWAYS win. And even minus the taxes will always, over the long run, yield a better return than anything a savings account can offer you. 

Side note: they also seem to have totally forgotten about investment vehicles like a TFSA (Canada) where you’re gains up to a certain point are tax free.

820,RA," Short term sacrifice for long term gain.

Think of every dollar you aren’t spending on that loan as you’re earning 18% return annually (or whatever the heck your loan rate is).

18 year olds aren’t smart with money - make a budget and stick with it. Don’t be afraid to tell buddies you can’t go to the bar (but don’t be afraid to spend $5 on 3 four Loko’s and still get lit). Live on campus - it’s cheaper despite what people will say about renting a place.

Just be smart and stay in your lane. I graduated debt free (scholarships, hard work in the summer, worked as an RA for free room and board for two years, etc). I know I’m one of the lucky ones - but it’s set me up to be able to buy a house by the time I was 24, pay for graduate school without loans, etc.

Again - short term sacrifice for long term benefits.",Washedup11,1,/r/stocks/comments/lokzh0/investing_my_student_loans/go6jv4d/,0.028,0.876,0.096,0.8735
