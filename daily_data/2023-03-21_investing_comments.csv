In link below we have Amazon workforce breakdown 2019 vs 2021 you can see how much their IT workforce grew. Overall workforce Doubled the size and this doesn’t even include 2022 when they went even crazier hiring (till Q3).

6,MSFT," If you look at a lot of these companies and how much they hired during the last 2-3 years and then look at the recent layoffs; they are still up a massive amount.

I cannot find the chart but like in the past 2-3 years MSFT hired like 250k people and has laid off like 20k recently

Amazon hired 1.5 MILLION people and has laid off like 25k

Point being these companies have grew and hired a massive amount over the last 2 years and their layoffs are just a small fraction of that",SirGlass,1,/r/investing/comments/11ww3oy/amazon_deepens_techsector_gloom_with_another_9000/jd3zma0/,0.0,0.847,0.153,0.9331
7,TC," >	hiring 40 000 people to serve multiple countries with online purchases makes lots of sense.

Depends on the type of jobs. Warehouse workers and delivery drivers and other retail support jobs, sure.

But this layoff impacts mostly white collar corporate jobs including PMs, engineers, engineering managers, designers, etc. They are cutting headcounts in Devices and AWS as well.

You don’t need to scale the headcount of the engineering team the same way in order to serve more online purchases, so that wasn’t the reason why the headcount exploded during the pandemic.

So yeah, all the big techs did overhire a lot. I was in the middle of it and Amazon recruiters were spamming everyone with a pulse nonstop for 2 years. Fresh out of school kids were getting $200k+ a year TC offers, frontline engineering managers were getting $600k offers from Meta, even interns were getting paid $10k+*a month*.

10,IT," They lost a trillion dollars last year. I can confirm we lost hundreds of warehouse workers this month and more from IT and corporate positions. Turnover and transfers in middle management are constant. I’ve had 5 different managers in less than 8 months. Half the workers aren’t self motivated anymore because they are told to do double the work with same pay and your raises max after like 3-5 years at 20/hr. Half the elderly and college kids walk around on their phones while the adults work. It’s all just going down hill and middle management doesn’t care. I literally can show up to any department on certain days and they can’t track me down or get me to work, if I wanted I could be a ghost for weeks without working and collect thousands in pay. 

It’s not just the economy, “the worlds best employer” is a joke and was over speculated. Now the market is just reversing to what it should be… which to me me would be pre-covid minus another decade of over speculation and people wanting easy money by pumping and dumping our economy. This is why millennials are so obsessed with sustainability and accountability, the previous generations failed miserably at it.

They have also planned to open dozens more warehouses and headquarters with the largest warehouse featuring most amount of robotic workforce ever and etc. They want amazons robotic workforce to increase from maybe 30% robots to at least 40-60%. But that is on pause and probably won’t happen in the next few years. Things are not looking good using their current business model and from what I can see management and CEOs haven’t changed shit.

23,EU," Their terminals pricing for Project Kuiper is very good, but no word on how much the satellites and launch will be, and those can be big costs. 

I think the main question is, Starlink's growth is already rapidly slowing down, so who will buy Amazon's satellite connectivity?

Forget the rest of the world. $400 is cost-prohibitive even in the wealthiest African countries (middle class salary in Nigeria is around $6000/yr), so Africa is out. China is out. Russia is out. They might pick up a few customers in EU, but again, how many customers left after people who bought into Starlink?

Normally your brokerage going bankrupt isn't an issue unless perhaps you have over 250k of CASH (key word cash) sitting uninvested even then the chance is small you would lose much. To mitigate this if you are worried just do not keep over 250k cash, just take that cash and buy bonds/short term bond funds/money market mutual funds

Unlike banks for stocks/bonds/etfs/mutual funds/ ect brokerages do not commingle assets (or its very illegal for them to try). When you deposit money into a bank that money is commingled it goes into a big pot. If that pot suffers losses and everyone wants their money back there may not be enough

A brokerage does not do this , you buy 100 shares of stock, those stocks get assigned to you. Those shares just sit in your account. If everyone wants to with draw or sell all their shares of ABC at once, well they can. 

So when you buy those securities those are in yours , no other creditor or person can make a claim to them. They will be sitting in your account. It does not matter if the brokerage goes bankrupt those assets are yours, no one else can take them , not the brokerage , not the creditors

Missing assets are the main concern of SIPC  , basically assets go missing if  your brokerage committing fraud , or suffers some technical glitch (servers blow up) .  So everyone worries if their brokerage goes bankrupt that is usually not really an issue because your assets will still be yours. Assets do automatically just go missing because the brokerage is bankrupt 

Your bigger worry is if your brokerage is committing fraud , and if you go with an established brokerage (schwab/fidelity/etrade/vangaurd) they are so big with so many people working I highly doubt they can get 1000s of people to help do the wide spread fraud. There are just too many eyes on them

Fraud usually happens in smaller cases like you have some advisor managing your assets and the advisor cashes out and runs off .

48,IMO," Masterworks is shady, in the sense that they cherry pick and change their ""benchmark"" for their performance over time whenever the previous metric doesn't give them the numbers they want to sell you on. In other words, their claimed historic returns are absolutely not to be trusted.

Publicly traded real estate, in the form of real estate investment trusts (REITs) is already part of any broad market index fund. There is no real reason to intentionally overweight them because they are real estate, any more than there is to intentionally overweight any other sub sector of the market. You can if you want to, but your are effectively weakening, not strengthening your diversification.

Private real estate can be a good investment, but if you want to do that and have the capital and income for it, do it truly locally, buy rental properties, and work them. It's a lot of work and comes with it's own set of risks, so I personally wouldn't bother, but it's worth considering. Most websites that let you invest in fragments of real estate of some sort are there to make money off of your capital. You'd end up with mediocre or no returns while they reap the benefits. Don't waste your capital IMO.

Commodities are interesting as a diversification but have the frustrating downside of a long term real return of approximately zero. As in, they more or less keep pace with inflation and don't gain or lose money in the long run. Which means that, effectively, it's fairly dead money in a portfolio, dragging down your overall returns. Now, the timing of their returns is uncorrelated to bonds and equities, so it does reduce overall portfolio risk, but the risk reduction on it's own isn't worth the reduction in portfolio returns. There are two ways around that. The first is that you use some moderate leverage to make room for adding in commodities without reducing your stock and bond allocations. For instance, if you want 20% commodities, you'd use 1.25x leverage on your stocks and bonds, so that that 80% of your portfolio still covers a 100% stock and bond allocation, and now you can include your commodities in the other 20% of your portfolio and the fact that it doesn't return anything in the long run won't matter. This is the approach a few risk parity funds and ETFs take for instance. The second option is to get your commodity exposure in the form of managed futures or macro funds/ETFs. Both of these types of funds get access to commodities in the form of futures. However, unlike commodity funds, these types of funds go long and short, can concentrate in specific commodities, can use leverage, etc, in order to get a much better return profile than a commodity index. Note that pretty much any of these funds will get you commodity future exposure, but many of them also use currency and global bond futures, and in some cases also various market index futures, so look under the hood what you're getting, but all of them tend to be excellent return diversifiers. Also note that I mentioned two different types of funds, managed futures and global macro, and then proceed to describe what they do as the same. That's because what they do is essentially the same, but the how is different. Typically, a managed futures fund will make its decisions on what to be long and short on based on trend following, as in, they are rules based. On the other hand, macro funds make those decisions based on the interpretations of the fund managers on the overall global macro environment. In practice, this makes managed futures probably a bit more consistent/predictable, but macro funds (with good managers) on the other hand can react faster to unique events in the markets over time, so both have their own pros and cons.",StrategistGJ,1,/r/investing/comments/11xbx1s/what_are_the_benefits_of_alternative_investments/jd3ciej/,0.062,0.842,0.097,0.9799

According to trackingdifferences.com. Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF (Dis) has a tracking difference (TD) of -0.02% since 2012. Three questions:

1. Does this mean the total cost of ownership is basically almost 0%? (Assuming external costs such as bid-ask-spread, brokerage fees and taxes are not considered)
2. Why is the tracking difference 0% when its expense ratio is 0.22%? How does that work?
3. Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF has an accumulating version, but the fund performance has only started since 2020.

56,AAPL," Hi,  
  
I've an idea around my head.What about... buy LEAPS of mega cap or index, and with the rest of the money buy some bonds or t bills (maybe a wheel of that) and sell covered calls (pmcc)?  
  
Example:LEAP of AAPL at strike 100 expiration 360DTE cost \~5500$, the rest 10,000$ you could buy bonds or T-bills and sell calls agains that LEAP.  
  
If the stock goes to the moon, sell both calls. If the stock goes lateral, ""premium"" (hehe). If the stock goes down, you lost same as if u were holding 100 shares, and if the stock goes deep in the mud, you only loss your 5,500$ but still having 10,000$ to buy more shares at a discount :)  
  
What do you think about this? Appreciate your comments!

**Total Portfolio = 15,500$ // Total income gross = 2,621.75$ = 16,91% Yield**  
  
Example of a LEAP on AAPL.  
  
Explanation:  
LEAP: 2Y maturity call of AAPL at strike 100 (Delta 90)  
Buffer: Approximately half of the LEAP, kept for market plunges if it hits strike of the LEAP. This is for purchase another LEAP deeper (50% stock plunged price maybe?)  
Bonds: rest of the cash invested in a wheel of 3 months t-bills.

61,CD," If you withdraw early from a CD you will pay some or all of the expected interest earned as a penalty. For example, if you have a five year CD you might pay one year's worth of interest or more as a penalty for early withdrawal. If you haven't earned that interest yet the money comes out of your principal. In your case you'd have to come up with that money to pay back to your loan provider.

So, if you're going to use it as an emergency fund make sure you know the withdrawal penalty and that you can cover the cost of the early withdrawal if you need to do that. If you can, great that's a good option. 

Managing a T-Bill ladder doesn't make much sense compared to just opening a 3-4 year CD in your situation.

You may want to open a Roth IRA since you qualify to contribute because you're married and your wife works. You can currently contribute for 2022 and 2023, and then for your next several years through fellowship and up until you start making real doctor money. 

The money grows tax free but you can withdraw all your contributions (not the interest) to pay off your loans. You can invest into treasury bills, CDs, or stock through your Roth IRA and in this situation you don't have to pay taxes on the earned interest.

62,CD," Current MS3 in a similar situation to you, but have dealt with no interest on my loans for 3 years now. I’ve done a mix of several things but most of them give me a guaranteed return because I want the loan money to be there when I need it. I have a CD ladder set up through Ally Bank in their 11 month no withdrawal fee CD that is earning 4.75%. I also have a liquidated amount in Ally’s HYSA earning 3.6% and contributed the max for myself and wife’s Roth IRA and have that money earning interest in a money market account. Honestly just having the HYSA and CD ladder is probably enough. T-Bills require a little more effort for not too much return. 

I have struggled with wanting to contribute to a Roth IRA and invest in the market versus keeping the money in a savings account to minimize how much loans I take out. I generally have settled on minimizing the loans because once the interest kicks in, it is essentially earning you a guaranteed rate of ~6% to not take out more money. If you keep the interest and use it to further boost your savings account and don’t take out more money each semester, that would be the safest bet.

Just thought I would add, make sure to not spend too much time and energy strategizing the best place to put your loan money, because in the long run it will make a negligible difference with your future earning potential.

I'm usually downvoted by people that don't seem to understand this basic difference between a savings account and a brokerage account. 

If you are seeking to invest in CDs which are offered by banks, it's probably simpler to keep your funds in a brokerage account which offer access to brokered CDs. It can also be simpler to build a CD ladder in a brokerage account than at a bank that limits you to the bank's own CD products. 

Lastly - if you have more than 250k in savings - you can spread your emergency fund between different bank CDs more easily in a brokerage account. You can't do that in a single bank account. 

Some brokers also offer bank sweep programs so that uninvested cash can be swept between different depositories (ie banks) so that no more than 250k is at a single bank. 

And if you need liquidity - you can also use money market funds. You can adjust the yield and risk using treasury, government, and/or prime money market funds. Money market funds accrue and compound interest daily and pay out monthly.

And if you live in certain states - you could consider muni money market funds which can increase your tax equivalent yield because muni interest may be exempt from both state and federal taxes depending on the fund. 

You can also ladder into treasuries and be exempt from state taxes. 

tl;dr - there are more investing options in a brokerage account than a bank.",greytoc,4,/r/investing/comments/11xkql7/safely_investing_my_emergency_fund/jd3kyr6/,0.031,0.892,0.077,0.8662

81,OP," I think OP is overstating the case, but there is something to it.

Any company can collapse, as you say, but one of those things which can accelerate collapse is being over-leveraged. Making bets with your own funds *and* borrowed money is inherently riskier than making bets with your own funds. If one company raises capital and makes widget factories, and another raises capital *and* borrows money to make widget factories, the latter is going to be the riskier bet, all else being equal.

And the nature of banks is that everything they do is inherently leveraged, because most of their lending is from depositors who need to be paid back first.

Of course, it's more complicated than this simple model. Banks are much more heavily regulated than random widget making companies, and that can factor in. But I think it's fair to say that banks have ways to fail that don't necessarily apply to other kinds of companies, and than an investor needs to be aware of those possibilities.",wild_b_cat,4,/r/investing/comments/11xl5se/are_banks_the_riskiest_stocks_to_own/jd3xu5g/,0.106,0.878,0.016,-0.9559

108,AI, AI is really good at finding efficiencies that people miss.  The problem is that it would do so based on past information and markets can get weird.,andybmcc,1,/r/investing/comments/11x8goi/how_long_do_you_think_itll_be_before_an_ai_will/jd2n6rm/,0.178,0.651,0.171,0.2006
109,AI," > Wouldn’t AI have to assume everyone is rational and the markets are 100% efficient?

What makes you think that? AI can absolutely deal with uncertainty, unknowability and market inefficiency, they are just parameters of the problem space.

> How would AI learn to trade around irrational behaviours from human investors ?

Same way human do, trial and error but AI can develop a much more accurate ""gut feeling"".

Also considering that the result of each trade can easily be graded (by how much profit it makes/loses), it would be a pretty clean application of Reinforced Learning. Short term trading is a perfect information zero sum game (or it's supposed to be without insider trading), it's perfect for AI to master. The rationality of opponents are irrelevant.

Don't get me wrong, the problem isn't trivial by any means. For example training would be expensive, literally, and you only get 1 day of training data from well... each trading day. And due to the complexity of the game itself backward simulation may prove to be of limited use too.

But *theoretically* speaking I can't think of any insurmountable challenges here, especially when compared to much more difficult problem spaces (such as when success criteria aren't even defined well).",cookingboy,3,/r/investing/comments/11x8goi/how_long_do_you_think_itll_be_before_an_ai_will/jd238vy/,0.085,0.754,0.16,0.9679
