18,TRCH," Nobody knows yet, it depends on how much money TRCH can sell their oilfield rights for.  


Anyone who has shares before the 22nd, and holds through the 24th will get a preferred share as a placeholder until it pays out.  After that your TRCH shares are converted 1:1 to Metamaterials shares.  Once you have that you can sell your shares if you want.  


The dividend has to pay out before the end of the year, and there are estimates flying around between $1 and $20+.  


So a lot of what you do depends on how much you think the dividend is going to be.",phate_exe,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/nzz1hd/trch_looking_ducking_beautiful_today/h1uanpj/,0.013,0.873,0.114,0.836
19,TRCH," DO you have any info on why your dividend estimate is that high? I have been running some numbers and the most realistic estimates I've come up with are in the single digits. I really like the company and am going to hold through the merger long term because I think META is on the launch pad to do great things, I see the dividend as just a little gravy on the side, and honestly I will use most of it to just buy more of the stock after the flippers get rid of theirs and temporarily drive the price down.

&#x200B;

I am basing my assumption on recent land sales in that area, current oil and gas prices, the price TRCH got for their last land sale ($1,300 per acre) and the fact that they need to sell by a deadline. Obviously it would be awesome if the dividend was over $20, but I just don't think that is a realistic price.
