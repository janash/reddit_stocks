0,AMC," Realized my strategy was obviously not working the past year. So I changed it up to shift away from options and into a strategy more aligned with swing trading and compounding account size

Edit: I have only used Robinhood as a play account so anything in here I planned to lose. I used it to test different strategies and different challenges. After the blow up in august I decided to use 4K and see if I could get to 100k with trading purely stocks. I also recognize December to February was insane for small caps and anyone could have made money

2,DD, Out of curiosity how did you size your positions? I'm always curious as to how people turn small amounts into large amounts so quickly lol.

7,RH," So is your strategy to just put everything into one stock, take gains, roll it all into the next? My RH account is also mostly all play money (I earmarked a few grand that it would really hurt to lose for the long-term) and I'm only up a little over 3k (on the initial 6.5) since January. Right now I'm thinking I might have spread it all out too thin, though.

8,CTXR," When your account is small unfortunately yes you have to do this. Once I got into the 7-8k range I could spread more money out across different plays. When you have it spread thin you don’t have the conviction or attention to make correct plays. So it’s best just to have 1 on a small account, 2-3 at a time on a smallish account and 3-5 on a bigger one. I currently have like 75% of my account in CTXR Right now obviously because I have super high conviction for this trade. If I played it correctly I would have bought my 5k shares sold at 2.7-2.9 then rebought when it got back to 1.5. Obviously didn’t do that and planned to hold until the catalyst of Mino Lok. I am getting a little worried with this massive run up though, if there’s anything less than stellar news it will crater and erase a substantial amount of gains.

15,GTE," * GTE has oil fields in Colombia.  The recent protests are no longer affecting production.
* With people taking COVID vaccines, economic activity related to travel and transportation could pick up, increasing the demand for oil.
* The price of Brent could go up to $100 per barrel.
* They have a high amount of debt and have worked out a deal to pay it off.
* One of the major stockholders is a hedge fund - GMT Capital.  They shorted on $TSLA a while back and lost big time.  GMT sold a lot of GTE to keep their investors happy, keeping the price down.  Now they own less than 10% and don't have to report each sale.

30,DD," I’m not going to go into defending my position bro. I have done extensive DD on the company and everything is pointing to this going way up. They spent a lot in 2019 to increase production and then oil crashed putting them in debt. However due to that spending and higher oil price they will be able to pay off all of there debt in the next three months in just three months time, well nearly all the debt. Priming them for extremely fast money making growth. Not saying that there isn’t other play but IMO this has the biggest possibility for the fastest growth. chevron/exon stock price is already way up and there isn’t much room for profit and as far as I know the government of Ecuador doesn’t publicly trade their stock.

Edit-The hedge they had in place ends july 1st and like I said they will be making roughly $800,000 a day pure profit at current oil prices and I see oil going up IMO. this will be a very profitable company before a years time.

38,GSAT," I've been a huge believer in GSAT since I started trading. I made a lot of profit on them when I realized that options suddenly appeared without any news whatsoever or SEC filings. So I figured if someone was going to write calls on a 30 cent ticker and someone bought the absolute crap out of the $5 calls, well I'll buy the .50 calls! Easy money... Then the news starts rolling in and they are a 5G play after all.

Along the way I found a paper from 2017 detailing their satellite broadband technology. So get this, a satellite up in orbit communicates to your phone over typical 2.4GHZ band, and beams back to the base station at 5GHz, which is connected to fiber and the rest of the internet. It has near complete coverage across the globe, +70 degrees to -70 degrees.

Ok, so what? Well that's a 5G offering using existing technology for one, when 5G is having trouble with current terrestrial radio coverage. Pretty crappy range. Nokia chose to partner with Globalstar for some of their 5G coverage, meaning 5G EVERYWHERE!

This is extremely beneficial for Nokia, but the best part of Nokia is their acquisition of Bell Labs from Lucent, meaning they get the IP for the Plan 9 operating system, which is perfectly suited for massive-scale networking and computing with software that can run on a phone. Beyond groundbreaking, and the OS has had stupendous potential for decades, if only someone could make the interface dumb enough for the average user. That's why phones are the obvious choice for rollout. Say goodbye to Android and it's bloat, say goodbye to iOS; plan9 is better by design.

Remember when Google was only known for it's search engine? Then gmail and other services came along? That was from the Bell Labs crew, that's what they brought to the table from their work with plan 9 systems, and that was groundbreaking enough when these concepts were introduced on current production operating systems of the time; the code just works, because it was made as a cohesive and simple project from the beginning where small code can be leveraged with other small code for bigger results. The Bell Labs guys even came up with golang for Google.

This rallied to $9s on news of the merger, so even if we only test that it's a great R/R. 
I'm selling 20 puts @ $3 expiring August and long on 1,500 shares at average of $3.81 after averaging down today.

68,TRCH," For me, TRCH dividend was only worth gambling under $8 which is where I entered yesterday. Today is ex-date, so if you paperhand now you don't get divvies. You gotta hold through tomorrow to get the divvies for what you held yesterday. Now is a good time to buy more for more META shares if you are in to META. Whats a fair value for META? TRCH at $3-5 w/o dividend in my opinion right now.

This is a great ground-floor opportunity on investing in META. One interesting tidbit from SEDAR is that MMATF is worth about 25-100M, if I read and understood the figure correctly, which is about on par with TRCH's facility for sale. So are MMATF's shares actually inflated? It is a technology company, so that would be somewhat justified.

The deal is complicated, but it's something I wanted to gamble on since I want to get into dividends. I think with the extremely sharp gap-down without more selling volume means I did the right thing. Not sure what happens next, but after the dividend record date (EOD tomorrow) I'd suspect a sharp sell-off. But with TRCH getting transformed into preferred shares I'm not sure if you can buy back in for more META on the 30'th. We'll see.

Another aspect is that MMATF holders get 3 META shares as opposed to a 1-to-1 META share for a TRCH share. There will probably be a profit-taking selloff on the 30'th when META comes online.

Just some ideas I've had about the deal, and what I'm looking out for.",WhatnotSoforth,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/o6d0tx/is_trch_worth_holding/h2sc6j5/,0.029,0.846,0.125,0.9574

83,ATOS," Ok so market cap is current stock price multiplied by amount of outstanding shares. Outstanding shares aka total number of shares offered in the market held by people and available shares. 

So in a way, when an analyst says that a stock will hit a certain share price they would value the company (in the future) and derive a share price from it based on outstanding shares. Like a math equation, market cap = shares * share price.

So like ATOS, if they were to hit a share price of 100$ it would mean that the 120m outstanding shares * 100$ would value the company at 12 bn. 

The hard part comes, especially in speculative buying such as ATOS who has 0 profits at this moment, will they be valued at 12bn in the future and will enough people be convinced its actually worth that value to bring the price up to match the sentiment.
