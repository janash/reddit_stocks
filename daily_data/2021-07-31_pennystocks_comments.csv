11,DD," Set up some kind of paper trading account so you can learn at no cost. Do your DD, make your paper trades and see what happens. 

There is no quick buck. I know you see +100k posts all over the place but that is the exeption, not the rule. Giant gains are not reality. 

This really is a casino, a casino that you will owe taxes on.

18,DD," dd=due diligence

And he‚Äôs right, it‚Äôs just research, DD, and trial and error. If you are trying to get rich quick you‚Äôll probably just lose it all. I started with $500 five years ago trying to ‚Äúget rich quick‚Äù. Went down to $40 being dumb. Got serious and now that $40 is about $2k. Yea I missed the train on stuff and sold too early on others. If I spent more time and energy could probably have been $4k or more, but gains are gains. Just try to make a little with each investment and it‚Äôll slowly grow. Very small chance you end up like these guys posting $200 investments that turn into $250k or whatever.",picklejam82,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/ov0705/need_some_help/h762dua/,0.067,0.781,0.152,0.9167
19,TD, Not sure I understand your question but I will tell you a lot of times it pays to be able to trade between 4-7 because some penny stocks will get news overnight and make monster moves. I've missed being able to sell due to holding stocks on my Robinhood or TD Ameritrade accounts,teemstro,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/ov0705/need_some_help/h78eyih/,0.082,0.918,0.0,-0.5075
20,TD," It's all about percentages. Yes, you can make a good living trading, but people who do have tens of thousands of dollars they can move around, at least. Even people that are really good lose money sometimes. Penny stocks are fun and can be really profitable, but they are also risky af. It's not a get rich quick scheme. More of a get rich slow scheme. But you have to learn how it works. 

The best thing you can do is educate yourself. Download WeBull or something (not robbinghood!), put 10 or 20 bucks in. Lurk on this sub, see what people are doing, build a watch list, and just watch tickers and paper trade for a few weeks before you start buying anything. Study technical analysis, learn to see the patterns. If you decide you like it, get a decent broker like Fidelity or TD. I like Fidelity 'cause they don't charge a fee for pennys and I still have a pretty small account. Their app kinda sucks right now but they're working on it.

22,DD," This is giving me flashbacks to TRCH. NSAV is listed as a healthcare company with 1 employee and is only a penny stock. It's not a real competitor to CoinBase or a Greyscale. This seems more like a ""buy everything to grow with big promises"" venture. Additionally if it was a big deal there would be media coverage of it, even in passing, on places like Bloomberg/MSNBC/Fox Business (I know, I know ""fuck the media"" but if it was an actual competition against Coinbase they would cover it. Coinbase is regularly talked about on Bloomberg at least). 

That being said, I do own shares of the company and have taken profit already the same way that I did with TRCH.

23,DD," This place is weird, nsav is the best play with such easy tangible DD that you can actually touch but they rather bet on things with a rumored court case or a biotech company working out of a foreclosed house. 

Just enjoy your gains OP, leave these dinosaurs alone. If they can't deduce how big it is to launch a crypto exchange, backed by wall street money after LCLP rocketed just on news alone they were going to aquire one then it's pointless to talk to them.

Also, they want to buy 270 million shares from German shareholders at 0,5‚Ç¨, so why has the SP not skyrocketed to represent this? Why are people not buying them at the current price and just reselling them to the client, making easy 5x?
