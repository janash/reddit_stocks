0,DD, I bought mind med at 0.18c and sold it at 3.15 in January. Was the first stock I bought and made money on. Only bought it because they did psycadelic research. I'm trying to buy as many psycadelic companies that I can find on degiro. Unfortunately they don't seem to all be available on degiro and neither is the $PSYK etf.

30,EDIT," Don't buy calls before earnings.

If you're worried you won't get in because it won't dip after, buy shares.

Right now,  $1 call for 3/19 has an implied volatility of almost 300% and a Vega of .0009.   It's pretty common for stock implied volatility to plummet after earnings, and you will end up losing 9 cents for every percent it drops.  Pretty common for stocks to get under that 100% mark after earnings.  .0009 vega actually isn't horrible, but it will still add up if you lose 200% volatility overnight.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT:  Obligatory this is not financial advice - even though it reads like it. Don't listen to me; look up how vega works for yourself (you should do that before trading options anyways).

EDIT 2: In all reality, if you actually plan to exercise the options at a later date, I guess it doesn't matter when you buy them.

42,ASRT," It is a covered call. It means you sell a call option but you have 100 shares of the stock (per contract) already. It basically negates losses on the option because if the call goes in the money and the buyer of the contract exercises  the option, you don't have to purchase the stock at a higher value to fulfill the contract. 

Example:
I own 100 shares of ASRT at $1. I don't think it will hit $3 by March 19th. I sell a covered call at $3 to the market for March 19th (which means I am selling a contract where I say I will sell 100 shares of ASRT for $3 a share). Someone thinks it will go to $5 by March 19th. They pay me a premium of, for examples sake, $20 to hold that contract to buy my shares at $3 whenever they want to up until March 19th. The premium is mine forever. The buyer doesn't get it back. It's instantly in my account to do what I want with.

Now for a few examples of how this can play out:

* Let's say on March 19th ASRT closes at $2.90. The option did not hit it's call price of $3 and expires 'out of the money'. I keep my stock and the premium. 
* Let's say on March 19th, ASRT closes at $3.10. The option hit it's call price but it didn't make as much as the buyer wanted. The buyer might let the call expire because they don't feel confident in it rising further. 
* Let's say on March 19th, ASRT closes at $3.10. The option hit it's call price and the buyer exercises the option. I sold my 100 shares for $3 a share, netting me a gain of $220 ($300 - $100 for initial purchase of the stock +$20 for the premium I received.)
* Let's say on March 19th, ASRT closes at $5. The option hit it's call price and the buyer exercises the option. I sold my 100 shares for $3 a share, netting me a gain of $200 ($300 - $100 for initial purchase of the stock) and the buyer sells ASRT for $5 a share, netting him $180 ($500 - $300 for purchase at $3 and -$20 for the premium.)

Now compare this to a normal single call where you don't own the shares under:

* Let's say on March 19th, ASRT closes at $3.10. The option hit it's call price and the buyer exercises the option. I now have to buy 100 shares at $3 to sell immediately to the buyer, netting me a loss of $280 ($300 - $20 for the premium paid when I sold the contract.)

A covered call protects you from taking large losses if things go well out of the way.

There are 3 downsides of covered calls. 

* You need to own shares in multiples of 100 (1 option contract is always 100 shares) which can get pricey. 
* Your gains are capped at whatever you sold the covered call at, so if you sold a contract at $5 and it goes up to $25, you only make the profit of it going up to $5.
* You must hold the stock while you have the contract. If the stock starts tanking 10% a day over the course of two weeks, you have to sit there on the ride and watch.

Covered Calls are great ways to collect some more money on your already owned stock with very low risk compared to other options. There is a lot that isn't included here but this is the relative basics of how it works. I'd suggest looking up some information about options and how they work (Youtube InTheMoney has a great set of digestible information about options and the different types including a great video about Covered Calls.)",tehcraz,37,/r/pennystocks/comments/lrrgzl/asrt_looking_bullish_big_fuggin_gains_coming/goq7ure/,0.032,0.842,0.127,0.9963

57,DD," This DD amounts to 'look at this thing, looks legit right?' The bear-DD did a way better job of pointing out problems that this DD doesn't solve. 

The whole concept is pretty iffy to begin with. They are 'backing' their coins with gold, but not really backing them in the sense you get to trade it for gold. So just the basic premise is already defunct.

Just about anyone with a basic understanding of monetary policy history will tell you that gold-backed currency is nonsense and bad overall in the long run for any currency. Its inflexible and doesn't allow for the kind of growth fiat currency does. That is just a matter of historical fact. You can only have so much gold in the world and gold only has so much worth to it. What happens when their mine runs dry? Or when the cartel in that area wants a piece? Are they just going to sit on the gold? What are they going to do with it while pretending their crypto has backing (especially if they don't have to actually give you gold)? 

This is the worst crossing of goldbuggery + cryptocurrency imaginable. 

If you like crypto, cool, just know that it doesn't really work like currency and its more like a volatile penny stock than it is like a currency. I could go more into why fiat currency works as well as it does, but the angry 'inflation is coming, run for the hills'-types are already mad right now and wouldn't leave me alone, so I won't. 

If you're a goldbug, your time to shine was about a hundred years ago. Your gold is gonna be worthless if shit actually hits the fan. Its only worth something now because modern society arbitrarily values it beyond its actual functional worth. The only nice thing about gold is basically that there are still lots of goldbugs who like to collect it and the price goes up occasionally. Its virtually useless in any sort of emergency scenario. When the mad max-style marauders come for you, they are coming for food, guns, fuel, and maybe you, if your mouth is pretty enough. They won't want your shitty heavy-ass gold.

As I posted in response to him Gold is routinely found in locations with iron. Gold is also highly localized. Furthermore Colima Mexico is listed as don't not travel from the US state department because its murder rate is almost 1:1,000 and is a hot bed for cartel activity. This is likely why they don't say where their gold mine is. At best it is inviting cartel involvement at worse increasing cost of protesting their assets. 

Core State Holdings has a product that has been out for years. Yes an employee left that is listed on their website as being a co-founder. Another employee has the same name as someone they want to/have purchased real estate from. They announced the building of a headquarters in March last year that may not have started work, assuming google maps is up to date. Another person on their website is listed as an advisor and doesn't appear to directly work for them, again not a mystery, she is probably a consultant.

($HITIF) High Tide price target doubled at ATB Capital

It’s double your pleasure with **High Tide** ([High Tide Stock Quote, Chart, News, Analysts, Financials TSXV:HITI](https://www.cantechletter.com/stock-quotes/?qm_symbol=HITI%3ACNX)), according to ATB Capital Markets analyst David Kideckel, who in a Tuesday update to clients raised his target on the stock from $0.60 to $1.20 per share, saying the cannabis retailer is poised for growth.

[High Tide](https://hightideinc.com/) is a Calgary-based retail and wholesale business with now 70 bricks and mortar stores across Canada, online retail platforms and a wholesale business in designing, manufacturing and distributing smoking accessories and lifestyle products through its subsidiary Valiant Distribution. Through the company’s recent acquisition of Meta Growth, High Tide is now the largest cannabis retailer by revenue in Canada, while its CBD and accessories business in the United States currently makes up a little under one quarter of HITI’s revenue.

The stock has seen a surge in recent months taking it from $0.20 in December to now in the $0.70-$0.80 range. But there should be more upside, according to Kideckel.

“Our positive view on HITI is driven by a healthy growth outlook and attractive valuation. Considering HITI’s ability to sustain share in the Canadian cannabis retail market, we believe the Company’s core revenue stream will grow rapidly over the next years,” Kideckel wrote.

“We note that HITI also has growth optionality stemming from its international sales of accessories and CBD, notably in the US. We estimate that the stock is trading at an attractive FY2021 EV/Revenue of 3x compared to Canadian LPs (16x for large-caps and 7x for mid-caps) and US MSOs (8x for large-caps and 6x for mid and small caps),” he said.

Ahead of High Tide’s fourth quarter results due on March 1, the company provided preliminary revenue guidance on February 18, saying its fiscal Q4 ended October 31, 2020, would be ahead of the range of analysts’ estimates of between $23.3 million and $24.2 million, while gross margin percentage should be stable with that of the first nine months of the fiscal year. HITI said its full fiscal 2020 revenue should also be ahead of analysts’ estimates of between $79.7 million and $80.6 million.

Kideckel has updated his estimates and is now calling for Q4 2020 revenue of $24.9 million (previously $24.2 million) and adjusted EBITDA of $3.2 million (previously $4.5 million). For the full fiscal 2020, the analyst is estimating revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $81 million and $9 million, respectively, fiscal 2021 revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $162 million and $24 million, respectively, and fiscal 2022 revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $243 million and $46 million, respectively.

“We have increased our revenue estimates considering not only HITI’s preliminary guidance, but also the continued growth in Canadian cannabis retail sales and the acquisition of SMCK in the US,” Kideckel wrote. 

“We have decreased our EBITDA margin estimates over the near-term due to our expectations regarding acquisition integration costs (META and SMCK) and the impact of COVID-19 (e.g., higher costs for delivery). Considering HITI’s significantly improved balance sheet and the improved liquidity on the stock, we have decreased our discount rate from 16 per cent to 15 per cent,” he said.

With the update, Kideckel has retained his “Speculative Buy” rating for HITI with the new target of $1.20, which at press time represented a projected 12-month return of 54 per cent.

“Our higher price target is driven by our lower discount rate and higher long-term revenue estimates, partially offset by the Company’s increased fully diluted share count given HITI’s equity raises and debt conversion,” Kideckel said.

Concerning its balance sheet, High Tide closed on Monday on a $23-million bought deal including over-allotment, issuing a total of about 48 million units at $0.48 per unit (each unit being one common share and one-half of a warrant) for proceeds of $23 million. HITI says the proceeds will go towards opening more retail outlets, M&A activity and general corporate and working capital purposes. The company has also announced the conversion of debt totalling about $27 million in debt into common shares.

For investors, Kideckel said major catalysts on HITI would include continued expansion of its retail footprint, better visibility on its international retail sales of CBD and accessories, improved regulatory outlook in Canada for cannabis retail and its listing on the NASDAQ.

HighTide announced on February 10 the opening of its 70th retail location in Canada, a rec cannabis store under the Canna Cabana brand in Calgary. 

“The new store is part of our strategic plan to build scale and drive revenue growth by selectively opening new locations in neighbourhoods that aren’t over saturated with existing cannabis retail options,” said Raj Grover, President and CEO, in a press release. 

“As with all stores operating under the High Tide umbrella, this new location will follow our exclusive one-stop shop approach that allows consumers to purchase all of their cannabis and accessory needs under one roof,” Grover said.",18AMG-GT,19,/r/pennystocks/comments/ls1cpc/daily_plays_february_25_2021/gop60i8/,0.017,0.9,0.083,0.9918

So I bought into Supreme because I truly appreciate their turn around efforts since getting a new CEO April 2020. They also have a great product and a true potential to grow.

I have 28,500 shares @ an average of 0.335 US Dollars.

I truly believe this company is being limited and held back because of being shorted and some articles like Seeking Alpha protecting this short interest. The last 2 Quarterly Reports have trended so strongly upwards and this company is significantly undervalued even given their wild stock dilution and remaining debt.

271,IMO," I'm guessing it has as much to do with the app being delayed and it had gone up 90% on Monday, so it's giving back profits... But I definitely saw a correlation between the reddit attack being posted and a big dip, and then it was deleted and AABB recovered a bit.

If you look at yesterday, the post appeared right around the big drop and it got deleted around 3, when it stopped falling and even rallied.

At this point, I don't think reddit drives prices due to redditors investing, rather it is because other social media like Twitter share reddit links and expose a lot of non-redditors to the hype. So we may only see ""X"" views/comments here, but any post gets seen by 10x as many people as we see here.

Edit: I'll add that it's the combination of everything that would spook investors. It's falling hard and they don't know why and they see an article calling AABB a scam... That makes them unsure of their investment, and other investors that would have bought in at a support line decide to avoid the murky situation altogether, which is why it fell so hard.

It’s double your pleasure with **High Tide** ([High Tide Stock Quote, Chart, News, Analysts, Financials TSXV:HITI](https://www.cantechletter.com/stock-quotes/?qm_symbol=HITI%3ACNX)), according to ATB Capital Markets analyst David Kideckel, who in a Tuesday update to clients raised his target on the stock from $0.60 to $1.20 per share, saying the cannabis retailer is poised for growth.

[High Tide](https://hightideinc.com/) is a Calgary-based retail and wholesale business with now 70 bricks and mortar stores across Canada, online retail platforms and a wholesale business in designing, manufacturing and distributing smoking accessories and lifestyle products through its subsidiary Valiant Distribution. Through the company’s recent acquisition of Meta Growth, High Tide is now the largest cannabis retailer by revenue in Canada, while its CBD and accessories business in the United States currently makes up a little under one quarter of HITI’s revenue.

The stock has seen a surge in recent months taking it from $0.20 in December to now in the $0.70-$0.80 range. But there should be more upside, according to Kideckel.

“Our positive view on HITI is driven by a healthy growth outlook and attractive valuation. Considering HITI’s ability to sustain share in the Canadian cannabis retail market, we believe the Company’s core revenue stream will grow rapidly over the next years,” Kideckel wrote.

“We note that HITI also has growth optionality stemming from its international sales of accessories and CBD, notably in the US. We estimate that the stock is trading at an attractive FY2021 EV/Revenue of 3x compared to Canadian LPs (16x for large-caps and 7x for mid-caps) and US MSOs (8x for large-caps and 6x for mid and small caps),” he said.

Ahead of High Tide’s fourth quarter results due on March 1, the company provided preliminary revenue guidance on February 18, saying its fiscal Q4 ended October 31, 2020, would be ahead of the range of analysts’ estimates of between $23.3 million and $24.2 million, while gross margin percentage should be stable with that of the first nine months of the fiscal year. HITI said its full fiscal 2020 revenue should also be ahead of analysts’ estimates of between $79.7 million and $80.6 million.

Kideckel has updated his estimates and is now calling for Q4 2020 revenue of $24.9 million (previously $24.2 million) and adjusted EBITDA of $3.2 million (previously $4.5 million). For the full fiscal 2020, the analyst is estimating revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $81 million and $9 million, respectively, fiscal 2021 revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $162 million and $24 million, respectively, and fiscal 2022 revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $243 million and $46 million, respectively.

“We have increased our revenue estimates considering not only HITI’s preliminary guidance, but also the continued growth in Canadian cannabis retail sales and the acquisition of SMCK in the US,” Kideckel wrote. 

“We have decreased our EBITDA margin estimates over the near-term due to our expectations regarding acquisition integration costs (META and SMCK) and the impact of COVID-19 (e.g., higher costs for delivery). Considering HITI’s significantly improved balance sheet and the improved liquidity on the stock, we have decreased our discount rate from 16 per cent to 15 per cent,” he said.

With the update, Kideckel has retained his “Speculative Buy” rating for HITI with the new target of $1.20, which at press time represented a projected 12-month return of 54 per cent.

“Our higher price target is driven by our lower discount rate and higher long-term revenue estimates, partially offset by the Company’s increased fully diluted share count given HITI’s equity raises and debt conversion,” Kideckel said.

Concerning its balance sheet, High Tide closed on Monday on a $23-million bought deal including over-allotment, issuing a total of about 48 million units at $0.48 per unit (each unit being one common share and one-half of a warrant) for proceeds of $23 million. HITI says the proceeds will go towards opening more retail outlets, M&A activity and general corporate and working capital purposes. The company has also announced the conversion of debt totalling about $27 million in debt into common shares.

For investors, Kideckel said major catalysts on HITI would include continued expansion of its retail footprint, better visibility on its international retail sales of CBD and accessories, improved regulatory outlook in Canada for cannabis retail and its listing on the NASDAQ.

HighTide announced on February 10 the opening of its 70th retail location in Canada, a rec cannabis store under the Canna Cabana brand in Calgary. 

“The new store is part of our strategic plan to build scale and drive revenue growth by selectively opening new locations in neighbourhoods that aren’t over saturated with existing cannabis retail options,” said Raj Grover, President and CEO, in a press release. 

“As with all stores operating under the High Tide umbrella, this new location will follow our exclusive one-stop shop approach that allows consumers to purchase all of their cannabis and accessory needs under one roof,” Grover said.",18AMG-GT,11,/r/pennystocks/comments/lry2d9/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gopkj1i/,0.017,0.899,0.083,0.9918

“Our positive view on HITI is driven by a healthy growth outlook and attractive valuation. Considering HITI’s ability to sustain share in the Canadian cannabis retail market, we believe the Company’s core revenue stream will grow rapidly over the next years,” Kideckel wrote.

“We note that HITI also has growth optionality stemming from its international sales of accessories and CBD, notably in the US. We estimate that the stock is trading at an attractive FY2021 EV/Revenue of 3x compared to Canadian LPs (16x for large-caps and 7x for mid-caps) and US MSOs (8x for large-caps and 6x for mid and small caps),” he said.

Ahead of High Tide’s fourth quarter results due on March 1, the company provided preliminary revenue guidance on February 18, saying its fiscal Q4 ended October 31, 2020, would be ahead of the range of analysts’ estimates of between $23.3 million and $24.2 million, while gross margin percentage should be stable with that of the first nine months of the fiscal year. HITI said its full fiscal 2020 revenue should also be ahead of analysts’ estimates of between $79.7 million and $80.6 million.

Kideckel has updated his estimates and is now calling for Q4 2020 revenue of $24.9 million (previously $24.2 million) and adjusted EBITDA of $3.2 million (previously $4.5 million). For the full fiscal 2020, the analyst is estimating revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $81 million and $9 million, respectively, fiscal 2021 revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $162 million and $24 million, respectively, and fiscal 2022 revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $243 million and $46 million, respectively.

“We have increased our revenue estimates considering not only HITI’s preliminary guidance, but also the continued growth in Canadian cannabis retail sales and the acquisition of SMCK in the US,” Kideckel wrote. 

“We have decreased our EBITDA margin estimates over the near-term due to our expectations regarding acquisition integration costs (META and SMCK) and the impact of COVID-19 (e.g., higher costs for delivery). Considering HITI’s significantly improved balance sheet and the improved liquidity on the stock, we have decreased our discount rate from 16 per cent to 15 per cent,” he said.

With the update, Kideckel has retained his “Speculative Buy” rating for HITI with the new target of $1.20, which at press time represented a projected 12-month return of 54 per cent.

“Our higher price target is driven by our lower discount rate and higher long-term revenue estimates, partially offset by the Company’s increased fully diluted share count given HITI’s equity raises and debt conversion,” Kideckel said.

Concerning its balance sheet, High Tide closed on Monday on a $23-million bought deal including over-allotment, issuing a total of about 48 million units at $0.48 per unit (each unit being one common share and one-half of a warrant) for proceeds of $23 million. HITI says the proceeds will go towards opening more retail outlets, M&A activity and general corporate and working capital purposes. The company has also announced the conversion of debt totalling about $27 million in debt into common shares.

For investors, Kideckel said major catalysts on HITI would include continued expansion of its retail footprint, better visibility on its international retail sales of CBD and accessories, improved regulatory outlook in Canada for cannabis retail and its listing on the NASDAQ.

HighTide announced on February 10 the opening of its 70th retail location in Canada, a rec cannabis store under the Canna Cabana brand in Calgary. 

“The new store is part of our strategic plan to build scale and drive revenue growth by selectively opening new locations in neighbourhoods that aren’t over saturated with existing cannabis retail options,” said Raj Grover, President and CEO, in a press release. 

“As with all stores operating under the High Tide umbrella, this new location will follow our exclusive one-stop shop approach that allows consumers to purchase all of their cannabis and accessory needs under one roof,” Grover said.",18AMG-GT,11,/r/pennystocks/comments/lry2d9/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gopkj1i/,0.017,0.899,0.083,0.9918

Several of the items in those posts calling it a scam have been disproven or are weak at best. For example, all of the stock being dispersed to one person are because that person was an investor in 2016, according to SEC filings. I found that in 10 minutes of googling.

> On  February18,  2016,  the  Company  received  $1,450,000  from Time  Call North  America LLC  for  a  convertible  note  withan  interest rate of  6.4%  per  annum.  The  note  had  aconversion  price  of  $0.25,after  a  2  year  period,and  a  4  year  term  to  maturity. As  of September30,  2020,  the  total  amount  of  the  note  outstanding  withaccrued  interest  was $160,065. 

So the real questions come down to...

Do they actually own mining property? (hard to prove)

Do they actually have all the income they claim (I'm sure the SEC would like to know if they are lies)

Are they actually developing a crypto? (Signs point to yes)",SH01-DD,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/ls8pn2/aabb_and_speculation/gor76n7/,0.062,0.843,0.095,0.7423

391,CEO," I agree with a lot of this, the CEO does seem to have a history of over promising and under/not delivering. That being said, I think a lot of it is the CEO getting overly excited about the potential they have right now. He is great at saying one thing while meaning another, I don't know if it's intentional or not.

He did clarify that when he said a ""leading"" broker, he was talking more about their technology.

While the new board member may be a smaller name than many were expecting, he at least is a legit name in the crypto space. He is also apparently doing new things with tokenizing real-estate which might be where the ""pioneer"" part comes into play. I trust NSAV slightly more with this hiring.

I'm undecided on the other stuff. Not naming the bank they are working with does seem sketchy, as well as the fact that Virtuabroker is a very new company with no revenues yet. 

They at least seem to be making an effort at becoming something more than just a pump and dump scam. They did announce today they filed an 8k.",Enderphor,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/lrot5p/2x_5x_10x_100x_nsav_new_crypto_trading_platform/gon9f3g/,0.052,0.85,0.098,0.8442

394,CEO," CEO is the face of the company, incompetent CEO will 100% lead the company to the ground, which is what he did in the past! CEO of the company = pilot of the plane you're flying on.

Second, there is no technology yet! What they are trying to build takes months at least, lots of money and a team of engineers, data scientists etc (which they do not have), and apparently the crypto broker team has other jobs according to their LinkedIn profiles - this will never work. Not a single investor will invest in the company where founders are not committed 100% of their time because the success rate is very low. Trust me, been there, done that. Also, what they want to build is not the same as what's already built, therefore there is no tech!

And lastly, their new director hasn't even twitted about it yet. I mean come on, it has to be huge for him, right? It would be for me to get on the board of directors of very exciting company.

427,PG," I worked in the ring of fire as a geologist 10 years ago, they were saying its inevitable then, and since then many small exploration companies and larger companies have tried and failed to hold claims and work effectively with the indigenous and first nations people in the area. The geology is similar in some ways to red lake, much of the gold and other PG element deposits are lower grade and arent as quartz vein hosted, this remobilisation of the gold in the system concentrates in in certain systems making it more efficient and cost effective to mine. Red lake has many concentrated deposits and the mine is under ground. Ring of fire is more likely to be a pit deposit. This leads to a higher environmental impact barriers to cross in remediation and during the pre-mining and mining process.

Not necessarily a bad play eventually, but when is the question.

432,TRCH," I think the dividend price is hard to gauge at this point, but I expect $1 with room for more. The big piece to me is that they own 147k acres of land. I have seen valuation on the land vary wildly, but $1k/acre would be more than $1/share dividend.


One factor that I haven't seen covered by you or others is how the shorts factor into the price. They have to cover all shorts by the merger, so how that impacts the share price is unknown. I'm holding on hoping that it hits $4 again, which is lower than some thought of $6-8.

I think your point about the ratio of TRCH to MMATF is valid, in that you can get a better bargain buying MMATF directly, but I would also caution that that doesn't mean the share price should be LOWER, per se. Instead, it could just mean that MMATF shareholders will get ""bonus value"" upon the merger. 

For example, let's play a hypothetical in which the merged META company ends up being worth $4/share. TRCH shares would currently be undervalued (it's now below $2.5) because they end up being worth $4, while MMATF shares are seriously undervalued, as they end up being worth $12 ($4 x 3 shares). So the value of both companies directly depends on what people think META will be valued at in a few months.",PsycheRevived,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/ls99s3/trch_argument/goq8fp1/,0.039,0.783,0.178,0.9882
433,TRCH, Not the entire value of their company. But the value of TRCH shares is intrinsically linked at a ratio of 1:3 with Meta. That’s what their agreement says you get after merger (+special dividend from selling the oil side). The shell of the company is worth 1/4 of Meta after the merger. I’m saying that the value of that special dividend does not add up to the two companies trading at nearly the same price.,thosewhocallme-Tim,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/ls99s3/trch_argument/goq7n88/,0.073,0.806,0.12,0.5983
434,TRCH," I’ve seen the valuation of the land all over the place. To be fair, I haven’t seen much of “why” people are validating it so high. $1k/acre sounds dirt cheap if you’re buying land near anywhere close to civilization. The thing I keep coming back to is if it was actually worth that much, why wasn’t it valued at that in their financials? Fair warning of my own bias here, I’m a geologist and have worked in the oil industry. There are reserves all over the place, but this site just isn’t worth that much unless oil goes far higher.

Shorts do have to cover, though it seems unlikely that this turns into the next rocket to the moon stock. The float is way high and the volumes are too. I’m not the expert on that and I hope it does jump up to everyone can make money. I don’t trust in that but it is a compelling argument for another raise in prices.

My thoughts are that I’m taking the money from TRCH and transferring it to MMATF because it looks to be the better value for this company. I don’t know how that land will increase in value by 4.2x from $238/acre to $1,000+ before the June sale date to get that $1/share dividend.",thosewhocallme-Tim,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/ls99s3/trch_argument/goqbuae/,0.034,0.82,0.147,0.9765
435,TRCH," All holders of TRCH keep their shares, while they issue new shares so that holders of meta get triple that number after the merger. It was in covered in their financial announcements. 

I’m agreeing that the value of the shares in total will go up when listed, still bullish on the company as a whole, but that is independent of which set of “original” shares you hold. The only thing that matters is the relative valuation of the shares as to which company is the better deal to buy into pre-merger.
