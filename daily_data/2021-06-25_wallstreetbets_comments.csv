3,AMC," Hello, I am an amateur WSB historian.

I followed what happened in Feb/March and what happened with AMC. When WSB pushed GME hard for the short squeeze, Twitter already felt they were left behind because the stock went up to $60 from ~$15. Now, the surprising thing was AMC originated from Twitter and it wasn't ""initially"" a WSB thing and Portnoy himself pushed hard on AMC. While WSB rallied to squeeze GME and thought BB was a fundamental gold mine, twitter itself spun up their own alternatives to these stocks AMC, and NOK. And Portnoy was one of the first few people that started to plug AMC alongside GME and BB. When the dust settled Portony made a profit (not a killer profit) with AMC and essentially left his followers in the dust. DFV never ever was responsible for the squeeze move for GME and he never bragged about leading the charge. Portnoy did, and he flipped.",anyfactor,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o7h526/david_portnoy_called_a_paper_hands_and_little/h2zeg6q/,0.057,0.912,0.031,-0.47

10,IMO, I don't know why you chose this out of everything he said as evidence of him being a dick head. What he meant was that if you spend your life taking online criticism to heart then you'll have so much anxiety and fear that you'll never end up going anywhere in life.

This new group of traders who have come along have created so much more volatility and added a lot of new money to the market. It REALLY is a game changer.

You can overlook the gains/losses and B.S. that came along the way - but the long term effects are going to be drastic \*(not sure if it's incredibly good or terribly bad) but it's likely very very bad in the short term and really really good in the long term

Who knows) \*\*Note - i don't mean all time highs or historic crash of GME and AMC - I am Talking about SPY and QQQ and the overall market.

There was a moral panic about this in the media and old school Wall Street, so they created the PDT rule. The theory was day trading platforms had to stop letting the poors join because they couldn’t make enough commissions off of them if they were blocked from trading.

This DD is terrible. It leaves out huge, important facts about the company, including their inability to turn a profit since 2006, and that it’s a mature company (founded in the 1990s) run by its original founders that sucks.

They exist purely through stock offerings because actual AR tech sucks. You can buy Chinese headsets on Amazon for cheap that do everything Vuzix sets do. 

And Google has a whole enterprise business for Google Glass, and it’s been around for years. There’s just no business in the space because real AR isn’t the Vuzix photoshopped PR that OP is giving you. 

Do we all not remember the whole “people couldn’t wear Google Glass anywhere because people would try to fight them thinking they were recording them because AR functions with a forward-looking camera?” 

And if the pandemic would make Vuzix profitable, why didn’t it? Sure, revenue was up a bit during the pandemic, but they did less business than a busy suburban pizzeria does. 

Snapchat released some new AR glasses just a few weeks ago. Big splash they made, huh? Honestly, when was the last time you heard about HoloLens or Glass? 

The “oh their patents” stuff is bullshit too. None of those patents are for related, useful technologies. How do I know this? Because the company is 20+ years old and if they had such a profitable patent they wouldn’t be doing 40m in revenue a year lol.

252,DD," Theres a ton of DD and analysts valuing the company between 18 and 30, with a majority putting the target at $20

The ecommerce market is expected to double by 2026, wish has been growing its userbase by 40% annually consistently for like the last 5 years, theyve got a lot of liquidity and no debt, and people expect 3.3 billion in revenue, so if wish was traded at the average market cap to sales ratio like amazon alibaba and ebay, its fair market price would be $20

The only reason wish dropped from 30 in the first place is because their high sales and marketing costs wrecked their margins. But they are addressing that with their own proprietary logistics platform and offering expedited delivery for additional cost and by trying to ensure quality products to reduce refunds

Yahoo, stocktwits, and any other platforms just really suck so it is good to see Reddit being a place that people can express themselves freely without any censorship or account getting locked because you hurt someone else’s fucking feelings.

279,SNAP, I don't doubt that people are just going to attempt to pump this and walk out with a hefty sum. That's just how trading via trends usually work. Regardless of that I still believe it's still an undervalued at its current price 13-14. Short term prob good % change. Long term likely will still end up stabling at a much higher price point. I felt the same way with SNAP about a year ago bought at 13$ watched it pump to 20$ then tank to 7$ and haven't looked at it till awhile ago saw it roughly around 68$ now. Frequently used apps such as wish/snap regardless of how garbage their initial products are have a lot of traction.

619,CLOV," 
CLOV news of expansion is a good sign and CLOV's stock will be attractive to longer term investors. Expansion plans usually entail higher capital costs and this will weigh on CLOV's books. So this might not be good but it is a transitory step to secure CLOV future revenues. As soon as its expansion plans get underway, we should see CLOV price action becoming more stable and move with market norms. Because of meme stock's associated volatility, these investors are well advised to steer clear of CLOV for now. For meme stocks traders and to get this CLOV gamma squeeze and moon shot, we really need to buy and have the volume to crowd out the short sellers. To the would-be paper hands, maybe you are in a cash strapped situation and need the small profits to get by. We understand. To the diamond handed CLOV holders, I'm with you and love the CLOV ARMY.

1012,AMD," Booger eating and neck beard  wearing nerd reporting here: 

Intel bought Altera a few years back; AMD buying Xilinx has been a moot point in terms of anti-trust since then... Altera and Xilinx were practically a duopoly in the programmable devices market, much like Intel and AMD being a duopoly in the desktop PC market.

Bullish on merger going through. Politicians' pockets are being lined as we speak. 

 With programmable logic alongside general purpose processors (also called systems on chip or SoC), imagine having a run-time reconfigurable procesor that adapts to tasks that are hogging resources. If you have a dedicated graphics procesor unit, but you never play games, then that GPU is a physical waste of space. Ergo, doing reconfigurable computing makes sense, so that when you do play games, voila, we can instantiate a GPU for you on the programmable side of the SoC.

In terms of raw processing power the AMD 6000 series GPUs are still behind (20.7 TFLOPS vs 29.7TFLOPS float performance), despite having a higher processor clock and smaller transistors. But the main selling point of a NVDA GPU over an AMD one currently is DLSS, an AI-Driven upscaling algorithm which significantly improves performance, especially when raytracing (simulating actual lighting rays which can be reflected and refractured instead of simulating shadows via ambient occlusion), and all whilst not sacrificing image quality (if implemented right). About two years later AMD now released a first glimpse at it's own counterpart, which is inferior in all terms: No AI, no temporal component, no significant performance boost and a small sacrifice in image quality.

1068,AI," For the non computer savvy folk here:

Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) indeed wipe the floor with FPGAs, but their limits are: 

1. that they are application specific (GPUs, crypt0 mining, computer vision, AI, etc.) and therefore if not used for their purpose, they waste space on a SoC/CPU
2. Expensive ($100+ of M to $1B+)  to develop and slow deploy.

General purpose CPUs that Intel and AMD develop aim to do everything, but at the cost of **not** being application specific and slow at those tasks. This is why co-processors, such as floating point units (FPUs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) were developed first off-chip, and nowadays as we are able to pack more transistors per chip, on-chip. 

FPGAs allow for reconfigurable on-demand computing, which ASICs never will. They allow the flexibility to make the general purpose CPU morph, when needed, to a time-bound (albeit \~10x slower) ASIC of a sort. They are also very energy efficient, and can increase the CPU processing speed of certain tasks by 100x to 1000x (still slower than ASIC, but not bad overall). This is their edge that general purpose future CPUs/SoCs will exploit to increase performance and power efficiency. 

The third, and probably most important, benefit is that they are reconfigurable by software updates; deploying the hardware first while incrementally adding value to the consumer via  updates is why they makes sense business-wise. Yes, they require expert programmers, but the software development chain has become ubiquitous and very rapid in the past decade and will continue to accelerate.",squathammer,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o7bb1e/amd_the_dd_that_will_make_you_rethink_why_you/h2yj980/,0.018,0.819,0.163,0.9909

1071,AMD," FPGAs aren't programmed like normal software. You use a hardware descriptor language (HDL such as Verilog or VHDL). While these languages support sequential functions the real benefit is that it's inherently parallel at the individual signal level.

Then take a few of these and design it such that opcode 1 dumps the output in a custom register that opcode 2 needs and so on. Then realize you don't even need to explicitly call each of them individually if you always want to run them in that order.

That said an FPGA won't out perform an ASIC in tasks the ASIC was designed for, so it's more for operations for which the ASIC wasn't explicitly designed.  The real nifty bit is you can reconfigure them in a few seconds and if companies really wanted to make them as application specific coprocessors then they'd need to implement something like a stack push/pop process for the configuration so that it could be switched in coordination to the scheduler swapping processes.

So the final answer is that in theory someone could write a library that reconfigured the FPGA to perform custom functions for that library when you call it from your application. There's a few missing pieces to make a smoother process, but I'm pretty sure this is the longer term plan for both Intel and AMD.",aint_no_lie,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o7bb1e/amd_the_dd_that_will_make_you_rethink_why_you/h2zcdoj/,0.028,0.907,0.066,0.8438

CLOV news of expansion is a good sign and CLOV's stock will be attractive to longer term investors. Expansion plans usually entail higher capital costs and this will weigh on CLOV's books. So this might not be good but it is a transitory step to secure CLOV future revenues. As soon as its expansion plans get underway, we should see CLOV price action becoming more stable and move with market norms. Because of meme stock's associated volatility, these investors are well advised to steer clear of CLOV for now. For meme stocks traders and to get this CLOV gamma squeeze and moon shot, we really need to buy and have the volume to crowd out the short sellers.

1510,ET," ET is the only short term bear case unless they somehow miss earnings, which they never have. A few things to consider, about a month back they sold 3-4 million shares around 32 on a high volume day of 4.5 million, clearly an organised trade to someone. Yet on last weeks pump they only sold 5 million over 2 days at a much higher price on a combined volume of nearly 100 million. They obviously could have dumped much more if they wanted to quickly exit at a better price than they have sold for previously, yet they didn’t. I have a few theories on this (none of which we can confirm so take with salt ofc). They have pre set sells at certain price levels by certain dates, they don’t want to drop below 50% ownership for various obvious reasons, or they simply couldn’t dump more, the CEO stated at a conference a few months ago “I wouldn’t worry about ET selling too much as they can only CONTRACTUALLY sell so many shares by certain dates”. I believe if we have another pump unless it goes much higher than last Monday we won’t see any more ET selling, at least in the short term.

I've only been in the stock market for about 6 months, and by sheer coincidence, I bought my very first share of AMZN today.   


Given the current circumstances, I am 100% fine with paying $3500 for it: by my read, it just got above daily resistance, and I can put a stop very close underneath. My risk on the trade is like $150. It's nothing. If I'd bought a few weeks or months ago, the price would have been lower, but the risk would have been much higher. And that's just quantitative stuff, it's not even thinking about the fundamentals. But the idea is the same.    


Of course, this being WSB, I probably shouldn't be saying any of this.
