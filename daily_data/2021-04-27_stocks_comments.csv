4,EA," I am long on GameStop due to several reasons:

1. Esports
2. Market cap of EA Games, 140 Billion (Not similar comparison, but you get the idea of how huge gaming is)
3. Gaming sector is 280 Billion (not inclusive of China)
4. Chewy is 40 Billion Mkt Cap vs GameStop 11 Billion. I have trust in RC‚Äôs mgt and they‚Äôre bringing top level execs from Amazon.
5. Shills, misinformation and negative narrative on the stock asking people (won‚Äôt label who)  to sell. If it was truly done for, people would not spend tons of money on negative marketing and let it bankrupt on its own. 
6. And I like the fact that we will give Amazon a run for its money as GameStop will carve out a niche for gaming down the road.

Seems like GME selling 3.5 million shares, it's a 4% dilution of the stock but that volume covers 1/3 of the outstanding short interest.

I fail to see how this makes the short squeeze closer to reality, it feels like this should move it farther out.

32,GME," I would say it depends on what you mean. If you expect the level of MOASS as some in the dedicated GME subs that think they will be millionaires with their singel digit stock count before summer its unlikely but not impossible. And by not impossible I mean if we argue that there is an infinite number of dimensions where every single thing that can happened has happened somewhere then a few of those has that level of MOASS. 

The more likely play is the long term bet on RC and the reinvention of GME and if that happens there is a realistic chance of a fundamental stock price in the 500-1000 range.

And no matter what you think of GME it is shorted and the stock must be bought back at some point. And the argument that the float still is in the tens of millions is becoming more and more unlikely. If you look at the ask bid total count it was in the hundreds of thousand in the first run up and now its unlikely to see it over 10k and dips below 1k in the lulls. 

The biggest factors of the likelihood and magnitude of a MOASS is how fucked are the shorts and how much of all the crackpot DDs about GME has actual merit. If it is more then none I think there will at least be a lot more volatility and more then one spike but how high that spike goes is uncharted territory and no one knows and anyone that claims otherwise is full of shit.",callebalik,4,/r/stocks/comments/mz87ma/gamestop_completes_atthemarket_equity_offering/gw1cjcp/,0.082,0.868,0.051,-0.9124

We know some companies are going to come out winners in the coming AR/VR gaming revolution and eSports space. Why not Gamestop, a company with a national presence, a strong name brand, devoted customers and an active board that has absolutely every interest in growth and innovation?

Everyone seems to focus on the short squeeze, and not on the long thesis put forth by true GME bulls, like Keith Gill, who actually seems to be more on point as each development rolls in.

Its 5% of the outstanding shares of (3.5M / 70M), (potentially over 10% of float which is around calclated at around 27M conservatively) which is not a ""drop in the bucket"".   Also as the the stock price goes up we def will see some small amounts of share dilution (this is a good thing if the cash is used for growth instead of paying down debts).  The fact the stock has been trading sideways the last few weeks despite the new shares should be the big news.  150$ may honestly be the new floor now that GME has basically wiped the slate clean in regards their past problems, and now has some cash left over to stay afloat with zero bad debt.

Article is from 2008. The problem was known all those years ago, it just wasn't fixed. All they did was change some of the dates involved in FTDs. But they left the loopholes wide open.

Juicy tidbits: It quoted an article from 2005, that examined 341 proxy contests (shareholder voting). ""It found that there was evidence of overvoting in all 341 of the case."" (Naked shorts resulting in stock ""multiplicity"" being the source of the phantom shares causing the overvoting.) At that time, in 2008, they estimated a settlement fail rate of at least 24 percent for settlements using DTC's CNS process. They quoted the case of Global Links, Inc., who had ""27,000,000 delivery failures oustanding for company shares. This while Global Links authorized and issued shares stood at 1,100,000, or an amount of fails nearly 26 times the maximum float.""

This may help explain why Gamestop's millions of shares issued in the last month wasn't noticed, didn't cause a noticeable blip in the share value. Instead of diluting a true or real share float of 26 million or whatever, the 3.5 million was poured into a much, much larger combined pool of real+phantom shares, greatly in excess of the real shares. How much larger? Who knows, but with r/superstonk pushing all shareholders to register to vote, GameStop is probably going to get a *significantly* larger vote count this year. Significantly larger than its 70 or so million issued shares.

To be clear, if buy orders are being routed through dark pools it also means it‚Äôs being sold in the dark pool. You can‚Äôt literally just buy orders and conjure them out of nowhere. Nor can you ‚Äújust sell‚Äù on a dark pool. Every transaction requires both a buyer and a seller.

>Every trading day, someone borrows 300,000-500,000 GME shares, as well as millions of ETF shares with GME in them.

Have you looked at this activity for other stocks too? Because this is completely normal. What you‚Äôd be looking for here is whether or not the borrowing premium is high or not. If it‚Äôs 1% or less the shares aren‚Äôt that scarce.

>If there aren‚Äôt an absolute ton of synthetics being shorted every day because the short hedge funds never closed out in January, then how else does the math possibly add up?

Because the sheer volume was more than enough for them to have covered and Melvin posted Q1 results. 53% loss for January is on the books- closed positions.

I‚Äôd also point out the February explosion was also a hedge fun blowing up the price via options. So they‚Äôre trying to both blow it up and keep it down? Makes zero sense from a short perspective. Just look at the big after hours spike tonight, it isn‚Äôt retail doing that.

135,DD," A lot of times is justs luck. For example, I learned about a micro stock named KRUS because one day I had great salmon and wondered if there were any sushi franchises. Typed sushi and to my surprise, there were none in the USA except KRUS. I did a ton of research and practically begged them to take my money (lol). Of course, at the time, their stock price was getting hammered by COVID so once I figured out there was no chance at all of bankruptcy, and how well locations were doing prior, it was a no brainer.

That was just luck plus normal due diligence.

Another one was Enphase. It was all over the news when that short report was published last year. It was also beat up by market forces and beat again by the report. I know a ton of about solar because I do installs for friend and family so for me, the DD was super easy and I could tell the short report was total fiction. I bought a bunch and at the time while it was still a midcap around $40.

Again, just chance. I just happened to read the news about the short report.

This happens all the time if you just stay alert. Back in the financial crash there was a huge effort to figure out what companies will survive. It was easy for me, years of experience in real estate, and i ended up buying tons of hard asset real estate companies, especially residential (rent goes up when people lose homes... gotta live somewhere) and government back mortgage stuff.

For example I've been building up my position on M V I S since it was $2. I did this by finding a massive 40+ list fo companies in the EV marketplace and doing a bit of research on all of them. I decided the LIDAR space was an emerging market, found three LIDAR companies that seemed relevant (LAZR, VLDR, M V I S) and had a position in all three. I ended up exiting my positions in LAZR and VLDR close to their peaks once I decided that M V I S was the most undervalued of the three.

I did have some gains/losses in other EV companies as well (GOEV, TSLA, C C I V, etc) but as I cut losses/secured gains and adjusted my portfolio I continued to grow my position in M V I S and I've been all in on them for about a month now with an average PPS of $10.

154,ALL," Remember for every post of a stock someone bought into a $1.20 and now it‚Äôs at $30, there is a 100 people that bought something at $30 and now it‚Äôs at $15 or $5.
  
Don‚Äôt mean to be rude at all, but the better question is ‚Äúhow and what resources do people use to research stocks to make solid investments‚Äù
  
I think there‚Äôs no right and wrong answer, it‚Äôs different for everyone and you quickly learn what works for you and what doesn‚Äôt. It only takes you one time to lose $1000 to not make a rash choice or use thin info again.
  
Some sub Reddit‚Äôs are good, some discord groups, some Twitter accounts, lots of news outlets like Bloomberg, Barron‚Äôs and Reuters. But I think the best approach is using ALL the resources at your disposal, cross check everything and research claims or opinions you find in one outlet on all the rest.
  
Those people that bought a stock you never heard of and now it‚Äôs a winner, probably fall into two categories. Either they found some info and did a lot of cross research and decided to invest and have been holding it long because they believe in it, or they saw an opinion and were able to time something right without any research and hit on a stock before a big catalyst.

168,DD," That's naive. There is usually reason a company is going down or a reason that it is going up. You need to do DD as to if the company is oversold/overbought or not.

Momentum is actually a pretty significant factor in returns. You could've bought all the dips in sears and lost a ton of money.

Secondly, with Nvidia, Microsoft, etc, if you bought them when up and held instead of selling early when up a few bucks, you would still have a high return.

In this bull market it's been working great, but that's because most stocks aren't down.

213,AI," You seem to have no idea about how robotaxis will work.

> People will still own personal vehicles for many decades. Even if they get autonomous driving to work, Tesla can't make enough cars.

Tesla can absolutely make enough cars. If robotaxis become the norm, car sales will collapse as people no longer need to own a car to get around. Sales will mostly be to taxi fleets. Tesla in theory can build 20M cars by 2030, in practice they may not even need to as that could be 50% of the market by that time provided we solved autonomy somewhere this decade.

> No operator would be willing to take you 2 hours to a low density beach town or to a mountain hike and risk having no fare on the return.

You don't need a fare back because the car can just stay there until someone wants a ride in that location. And if there are already enough cars in that area, one will drive somewhere else while you are taking your trip there and your car will replace the one that drove away. The network will automatically scatter cars around the country based on how many trips are planned at what time a day from which locations, etc.

This might sound unrealistic right now, but it's already being doing with things like eScooters that aren't even autonomous.

> No taxi operator would be willing to take a passenger cross country because if there's a vehicle issue, it will be hard to get fixed and expensive to tow.

Again, there's no taxi operator and it doesn't matter if it's difficult to get fixed because the car can just drive to a service center.

> Taxi service will be restricted even if the car can drive anywhere. Even if Tesla operated the service themselves, they would only operate in high density regions. They need a certain volume of cars in the fleet so the wait times aren't horrendous.

Again, see my explanation above. Wait times are irrelevant, because cars can distribute themselves. Many cars in high density regions, fewer cars in low density regions.

> It will be decades before no one will need personal vehicles. There just isn't enough production or demand.

People said they'd never carry a mobile phone around during the late 90s. 5 years later everyone had one.

> I'm not saying it's not in the cards, I'm saying the immediate future of autonomous taxis is more likely waymo than Tesla. If or when Tesla figures out autonomous driving, they will still compete with the other companies for a long time. There just isn't enough cars.

While I do agree that geofenced or at the very least area-limited robotaxis are most likely in the near-future (next 5 years), it all depends on how fast Tesla's neuralnetwork can train itself once their supercomputer comes online. If it trains itself as fast as other self-learning AIs, which is most likely, it will happen within 5 years and Waymo is fucked. That said, it could be more difficult than other self-learning AI products, so we won't know for a few more years.

I'm sorry to say, but no expert truly believes this. The projections you're referring to have been wrong every year for almost a decade now, yet they still refuse to adjust their expectations. They keep expecting EV sales increases to flatten off, when realistically they're just increasing.

EVs are already cheaper over a 3+ year period of ownership today. They are expected to become cheaper in terms of sticker price within 1-3 years. Then they're expected to drop another 20-40% throughout the rest of the decade. Meanwhile ICE cars are becoming more expensive.

Which idiot is going to buy an ICE car in 2030 when they're 20-40% more expensive to buy and 4x more expensive to own, as well as slower, less comfortable to drive and worse for the environment?

Chevron and toyota have a solid new-ish deal with Chevron providing cleaner hydrogen for toyotas fuel cells and also investing in the infrastructure required for said fuel cells.

I also invested in platinum/palladium mining companies (mainly sibanye-stillwater) because EVs and hybrids use a lot more of those platinum group metals than ICE cars. I figured that was the safest exposure to that bubble.

You can review their financial statements any time. Their bikes and treadmills are just a way to provide another avenue towards their app. The revenue is high on the products, but so this the cost. Their margin is almost entirely made up out of people who use the app.

In a future world, it's very possible these machines are collecting dust and the stock also reaches 400 precisely because it's able to focus growth on the app. In other words, in today's world they ""steal"" customers from gyms like SoulCycle with necessarily expensive equipment but it's conceivable that in the future the only people who connect Peloton with indoor cycling are the same people who connect Amazon with used books.",CommercialFindingNo9,6,/r/stocks/comments/mzklc7/rstocks_daily_discussion_technicals_tuesday_apr/gw2s9nl/,0.0,0.939,0.061,0.8608

Is it a good time of year for buying your stock? For example, everyone wants to have clothing retailer stocks when they are reporting Q4 earnings. Nobody wants to be buying then. Buy after everybody else is done taking profit.

What's the company's situation with debt? High debt to assets (more debt than assets) or not so much? Is it mostly short-term debt or long-term? Is the company turning a profit? All the revenue in the world is not impressive if it gets eaten up by keeping the lights on. A certain stock beloved by non-human primates has shot up today upon news that a ton of the company's debt has been retired early, and the at the market offering of 3.5 million shares has been completed without the stock falling like a stone. That company's balance sheet is now a lot healthier, and they will be able to use the rest of the new money to change the business to run primarily online and be more customer service focused. I'm not convinced it will end up being the lunar phenomenon that the most ardent fans say it will be, but I'm happy to see that the company will have a second chance at life thanks to the likes of Ryan Cohen.

What kind of uncontrollable things might affect your company? This year, everyone with their eyes glued on semiconductors has gotten a lesson in Taiwanese climatology. Turns out water is pretty important to TSM's bottom line.

Go to Finviz and look at the chart for your stock. Is now a good time to buy? Does it look like it's at a temporary peak and volume is decreasing? Maybe hold off. Is the RSI over 70? Just wait a few days and pick it up at a discount. On the other hand, does it look like it's hit a bottom, bounced, hit the same bottom, bounced, and hit the bottom again? Now might be a good time to buy in that case. Check out the moving averages too... 20 day MACD shooting up over the 50 day is good news for bulls, 20 day MACD falling down below the 50 day is good news for bears.

While you're at Finviz, take a look at what analysts are saying about the target price of that stock. It's not that the analysts are always right, it's that people often listen to them. 

Ok, now price to earnings is a little controversial. Historically, a ratio of 39 or higher was considered bearish (see the crash of 1929 for more details), but due to the unprecedented situation we find ourselves in due to the pandemic, speculation is higher than normal right now and for the moment that's ok. Once we start reopening fully, if a company's price to earnings stays ridiculously high, that's not a great sign.

If you want to buy a stock with some weirdness going on with the price, make sure you have put some thought into why it might be inflated.

I'm not convinced it will end up being the lunar phenomenon that the most ardent fans say it will be, but I'm happy to see that the company will have a second chance at life thanks to the likes of Ryan Cohen.

What kind of uncontrollable things might affect your company? This year, everyone with their eyes glued on semiconductors has gotten a lesson in Taiwanese climatology. Turns out water is pretty important to TSM's bottom line.

Go to Finviz and look at the chart for your stock. Is now a good time to buy? Does it look like it's at a temporary peak and volume is decreasing? Maybe hold off. Is the RSI over 70? Just wait a few days and pick it up at a discount. On the other hand, does it look like it's hit a bottom, bounced, hit the same bottom, bounced, and hit the bottom again? Now might be a good time to buy in that case. Check out the moving averages too... 20 day MACD shooting up over the 50 day is good news for bulls, 20 day MACD falling down below the 50 day is good news for bears.

While you're at Finviz, take a look at what analysts are saying about the target price of that stock. It's not that the analysts are always right, it's that people often listen to them. 

Ok, now price to earnings is a little controversial. Historically, a ratio of 39 or higher was considered bearish (see the crash of 1929 for more details), but due to the unprecedented situation we find ourselves in due to the pandemic, speculation is higher than normal right now and for the moment that's ok. Once we start reopening fully, if a company's price to earnings stays ridiculously high, that's not a great sign. Take a look at a bunch of car companies like Ford, Toyota, GM, etc. Check out their price to earnings. Then look at Tesla. The Tesla fan excuse is that TSLA is not purely a car company. If you want to buy a stock with some weirdness going on with the price, make sure you have put some thought into why it might be inflated.

Let's talk about the options chain. I know, you just want to buy shares, but the options chain will let you know if people are anticipating big moves in either direction. Compare the ratio of puts to calls to get a feel for how people expect the stock to move. Of course, they could all just be wrong and theta gang wins again...

Finally, check the news about your stock. Google news search is your friend.",Cheshire_Cheese_Cat,21,/r/stocks/comments/mze4nb/what_are_some_key_things_to_look_for_when_doing_dd/gw0c9he/,0.057,0.784,0.159,0.9975
420,PM," potential events that could heavily influence the stock one way or the other are probably the most important. 

many companies have some major event looming around the corner that could heavily influence the stock price.

recent example: chip shortage, based off the companies inventory how their operations responded to the chip shortage is huge. 

severe weather, a severe flood in an area early in a companies supply chain could very easily MESS up their earnings that quarter.

If you double the workers it means can work on 2 project at once. It doesnt matter if dev times are the same per project, you still have double the number of releases assuming similar scope/scale of projects.

You don't do a pre-prod phase of any game with 700 people. Ramping up to 70 in pre-prod can take up to a year. Seasoned developers who started a new product, were decent enough with their skills to be let anywhere near team building and recruitment would know that.   


Their culture change, where they 'embrace more agile ways of work' got me chuckling for a while.

Gamedev is not a sweatshop, and you don't do creative stuff like that. If they do transform more towards Agile, good for them. It will take 1-2 years, and for the love of god I do hope they'll stay away from SAFe. As a seasoned dev you understand the difference between SAFe and Scrum, so I'm not going into details here.

First thought would say no. The technologies that enabled companies to communicate during the lockdown are valuable and will forever replace some business travel.

However, nobody wants to commute anymore. It seems likely to me that many employees will work from home most/some of the time. Where will these employees stay when they come back to the city centers for their monthly meeting?

I wonder if hotels in city centers are a better investment than office space in the same areas.

To counter point CDPR position, a lot of its hype was due to gamer good will they had built up over that same decade or so period.  Good will that has evaporated since then.  Now can they rebuild it?  Possibly, its true gamers really struggle with long term memories.  That said their free marketing team which was the goodwill of those same gamers at least to the short and medium term IS shot.  

The biggest difference is imo EA never tried to make itself pro-gamer as one of its pillars of its business.  It just pumped out games and marketing.

510,NEW," I disagree only with the timeframe. There are only 1.4 million electric cars on the road in the US right now, with 280 million privately owned gas vehicles and 12.5 million gas commercial trucks. While electric cars existed since the civil war, its only since 2016 that electric cars made any inroads. While sales should begin to ramp up, 15 million gas cars are expected to be sold in 2020. That's a normal year for gas automobiles. Projected sales for 2030 is half that, at 8  million privately owned gas cars projected to be sold for 2030. So for 2030, gas and electric car sales are projected to be equal. This will not diminish by attrition or replacement, any significant percentage of the 280 million currently owned gas vehicles.

Not only do NEW car sales have to transition to EV, but all 280 million current gas automobiles need to reach a minimum mass through replacement. If by 2040, gas automobile sales cut in half again to 4 million, with 12 million electric cars sold, that is when electric cars will begin to significantly replace gasoline automobiles. Using the projected sales figures by the auto industry, by 2040 there would be half electric vehicles on the road and half gasoline remaining, with about 150 million of each. Gas stations won't feel the heat to have EV charging until this critical mass is reached about 2040.

And this timeframe is assuming there is 0 pushback from Exxon, and other gasoline giants with massive waves of advertising to sway public opinion to retain their products, or kickbacks to car manufacturers.

You have 100 XYZ @ $1

XYZ does a 10:1 reverse split

You now have a 10 shares of XYZ @ $10

If you look at the chart of XYZ before the reverse split it'll show a price of $10  per share (because the new share is worth 10 of the old ones)

I'd guess CEI was at a few thousand a share back then before they did that really big reverse split so that's why it says 2 million a share lol",suna123,3,/r/stocks/comments/mzfrsq/can_someone_help_me_understand_reverse_splits_cei/gw0k4zo/,0.0,0.763,0.237,0.9633

But how long can the general store compete? One little upset and it's bankruptcy. This isn't a matter of opinion, it's something that has played out time and time again. 

I go to a specialty grocer for a focaccia, fresh squeezed OJ, and sometimes gourmet ice cream. EVERYTING else I buy from Trader Joes or Costco. I LOVE the specialty grocer, it's an amazing store. Kind, friendly employees who provide an enjoyable experience. So, why go to that dreary Costco with the annoying lines? Because I can't justify spending an extra $100-150 on weekly groceries.

520,IMO," A couple things...IMO 

First, doesn't sound like you have a plan/goal when you're buying.   Take $CRSP for example.   Did you buy it to own it, or to trade it?  If to trade it, what was your target profit??  Having a plan going in allows you to be less reactive to the ebs and flows.

Second, if something gaps up way past where you thought it would be/above your target price for profit,  but you think it's got more room to run, you can always take your cost basis off the table and let the rest run.   That way you're guaranteed profit, maybe less than what you planned if it drops, but you still have exposure if it continues to run.  And again, since you covered your cost, it's all house money, so it should be a little less of an emotional experience. 

It's not about timing the market, it's about time in the market.
