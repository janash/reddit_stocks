32,NAV," That depends on what portion of the $150k is in your whole investment fund. If $150k is the whole fund, then, I would be divided it into 4 sections.

1.) VTI, as a lot of other said, since it is the whole American market, it is less likely to crumble, and given a very long time frame, it is most likely profitable. $50k to $70k, depends on your risk tolerance, and expected return of the time span. If a 15% annual return expectation in 5 year, or 20% annual return in 10 years are feasible, I would definitely go to $70k.

2.) USA, any high dividend ones do, I said high, means at least 6%, $30k to $50k. Again depends on your risk tolerance, expected return is about 8 to 15% annually in 5 to 10 years. Given the dividend reinvested, is quite steady, backtested to 1995 comparison to SPY, it is just about 21% off of SPY gain, that's about 0.80% off per year (I know my math sucks, so just Google, YouTube, research about it yourself).

3.) Individual small-mid cap stocks mostly that have prospective, and a little bit of sure win large cap (example, ZTS). $30k to $50k, you want to risk a bit more to gain more, that's what investment is for, you wanna brag about how your investments grow after years.

4.) Individual stocks or ETFs for short term gamble, $10k to $20k. Here's where the fun seconds to 3) or more, you can play however you want, risk it all, or play several at a time. There's nothing wrong to lose or win less in comparison to others, just the amount and ones you feel comfortable with.

Pretty much sums up all what I am doing right now. Not that I have $150k to invest. I don't know nothing about real estate, and consider it very time consuming and less profitable if done wrongly, so I stay out of it.

If on the other hand, $150k is not your whole investment fund, you have other risky investments, and you want steady income, you may just pour it into USA like I said, grants you about 7.5% annual income, that's about $900 to $1000 per month of income, consider if NAV don't drop much over time.

34,GOOGL," Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon, or simply just broad market index funds and ETF’s. I feel like the massive companies everybody knows and uses their products are the ones that will continue to grow, innovate, and be around years from now, especially tech stocks, and especially just 5-8 years from now. Apple and Microsoft both have over $2 TRILLION market cap. If you wanted the highest possible % return then I wouldn’t just dump it all into a blue chip or an ETF though, that’s where you take on a little more risk, but if you wanted a somewhat comfortably safe place to put it where you aren’t worried about not seeing any return at all, the blue chips are where I’d store it. I put $100 into GOOGL at the end of last year and it’s currently worth $138+. With $150K, and a 5-8 year timeline, theres a lot of potential there. Also, this is a stocks subreddit so I only mentioned stocks but otherwise, with that kind of capital, you’d likely be able to put money down on a rental property and receive monthly income from the unit(s), also gain equity in the property in the meantime and make a return upon selling the property down the line as well. Real estate is the best passive investment besides the stock market for sure. For multi-family real estate investing I’d suggest looking up a guy named Grant Cardone. The guy leverages his money against the bank’s to acquire huge assets (like 400-unit apartment complexes) and simply manages them and pays off the loans on them at the same time as keeping the rest of the profits for himself and his investors at Cardone Capital. Either way, remember that some return is still better than no return.

If you expect the interest rates to go higher (and they are quite low), then tech tends to suffer a bit. This is part of the reason SPY has gone up 14.7% this year, while QQQ has gone up 11.6%. Mind you, it's still an awesome return.

47,PLTR," Your comment is like my comment, the only difference being that you seem to be serious. OP, don't do any of the things this guy is telling you.  


1. There's no way to seriously value any Coins, so I personally wouldn't touch Crypto at all, but if you seriously want to get into Crypto I'd advise you to NOT put 40% of your money into Crypto lol.  

2. PLTR and TSLA are great companies but not great investments in my opinion. Especially Teslas valuation, even after falling about 30% YTD, is way too high. I seriously wouldn't even buy Tesla at $50. They're not only diluting the hell out of you but the ""projections"" (read: phantasies) are in no way shape or form realistic to justify their current price. If you seriously want to buy Tesla at a Market Cap of 650 Billion Dollars you should go to a psychiatrist first because this thing won't end well. People always laugh at you for not owning X stock. It was Cisco in the year 2000 when the Dotcom bubble burst. They'll laugh at you for not owning it, but they'll get very quiet the second all their phantasies turn out to be unrealistic which makes the stock crash. You might miss the hype but you'll also miss the crash. Generally I would advise you to not touch any EV or Renewable Energy stocks at the moment because almost all of them are horrifically overvalued, for obvious reasons (just like in the dotcom bubble).  

3. It's great how you think Real Estate is overvalued but don't think that most stocks are in the same situation. I disagree.

48,TSLA," Your comment is like my comment, the only difference being that you seem to be serious. OP, don't do any of the things this guy is telling you.  


1. There's no way to seriously value any Coins, so I personally wouldn't touch Crypto at all, but if you seriously want to get into Crypto I'd advise you to NOT put 40% of your money into Crypto lol.  

2. PLTR and TSLA are great companies but not great investments in my opinion. Especially Teslas valuation, even after falling about 30% YTD, is way too high. I seriously wouldn't even buy Tesla at $50. They're not only diluting the hell out of you but the ""projections"" (read: phantasies) are in no way shape or form realistic to justify their current price. If you seriously want to buy Tesla at a Market Cap of 650 Billion Dollars you should go to a psychiatrist first because this thing won't end well. People always laugh at you for not owning X stock. It was Cisco in the year 2000 when the Dotcom bubble burst. They'll laugh at you for not owning it, but they'll get very quiet the second all their phantasies turn out to be unrealistic which makes the stock crash. You might miss the hype but you'll also miss the crash. Generally I would advise you to not touch any EV or Renewable Energy stocks at the moment because almost all of them are horrifically overvalued, for obvious reasons (just like in the dotcom bubble).  

3. It's great how you think Real Estate is overvalued but don't think that most stocks are in the same situation. I disagree.

145,AMC," Short selling doesn’t directly affect a company. The only reason that I’ve heard as to why people would believe short selling affects a company is that AMC was able to climb out of bankruptcy by selling stock after the short squeeze.

But my argument for that is AMC operates in a dying industry, and was bankrupt because of it being a poor company.

Unpopular opinion: short sellers were very smart to short a movie theater chain during a pandemic. Most cultists don’t like to hear that 😂

Bottom line: shorting does not affect a company directly.",Jack-Skinne,20,/r/stocks/comments/o8tpoc/how_does_shorting_affect_a_stock/h372ufb/,0.119,0.806,0.074,-0.6873
146,AMC," Failing ≠ Failed 

Shorting affects the company, by effectively removing one way of financing a pivoting strategy. Let's say, for example, that AMC realizes it's current business model isn't working, so it comes up with a new one to bring it into the modern world.  But to adopt new technologies, it needs to raise $100 Million which is not available from lenders, so it needs to issue stock. Let's say that the stock was holding pretty steady at $50/share, so the offering is set for 20 million shares to be issued.

Now hedge funds come in and significantly short the stock... shaking confidence and dropping the price to $25. That drop would likely result in much less capital being raised, maybe not enough to make the pivot that would have saved the company. 

It's like draining a lake of water and blaming the fish for not being able to breathe air, or not choosing a different lake.",goinLAte,1,/r/stocks/comments/o8tpoc/how_does_shorting_affect_a_stock/h392xga/,0.076,0.796,0.128,0.8807
147,IMO," True, that's the worst case scenario for the company and the best case scenario for the bears.

Good accounting practices plus profitable business equals no need to raise money through floating more shares IMO. Plus, if you float more shares, you dilute your existing shareholders and I've seen that most companies tend to resort to bank loans anyway before floating more shares. After all, diluting the shares leads to a lower EPS, lower dividend yield, lower book price per share, etc. No well-performing company would do that  IMO unless they're seriously overvalued (Tesla).

S3 partners and Virtu also have extremely cozy relationships with some of the hedge funds they report on.

1: selling does not decrease a stocks price. In fact, every buy needs a sell, so your logic would create an infinite loophole. 

2: the stock price is an imaginary number that doesn't exist. It either shows bid+spread/2 or the last sell price for most brokers. 

3: if I own a 250$ NVDA share and sell it for 300$, then it didn't decrease the stock value. In fact, it increased it if the last stock sale was below 300$.

4: shorts can't magically make up a price. A short position first requires the broker to buy a share at the current price and then you straight up just sit there, hoping it goes down. It's the same as buying. Your act doesn't influence what other people sell or buy at in the slightest.

Addressing your first point:

Selling a stock CERTAINLY decreases a stock’s price. The stock market is based on supply and demand. By selling, you increase the supply. No, I am not saying your one share of AAPL will decrease the stock’s price by any measurable amount but if 50% of AAPL shareholders decided to sell one day, the price would crater. 

“If more people want to buy a stock (demand) than sell it (supply), then the price moves up. Conversely, if more people wanted to sell a stock than buy it, there would be greater supply than demand, and the price would fall.”

Addressing your second point:

An imaginary number that doesn’t exist? 

The current price is the most recent selling price of the stock, with adequate liquidity this number certainly isn’t “imaginary” but instead a very good indicator of what you could buy or sell the stock for. If you want to “market buy” you pay the ask, “market sell” and you get the bid. Again, with enough liquidity these numbers, or the “spread” should be very close to the “current price” or what you called “imaginary” 

Source: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentprice.asp

Your third point:

Yes, buyers meet sellers and a exchange of shares goes through.

Your NVDA is example is not necessarily realistic though, you’re essentially saying you have a limit sell at $300 that you’re sure will get filled. You don’t get to choose. If the last sale was at 299, your share is available at $300 but the market has people willing to sell at 298, 297, 296, 295 etc. do you ever think your $300 limit sell will get filled? Probably not, and thus why selling pressure increases supply and reduces the price (see point 1).

Your fourth point:

Again referencing point 1. Borrowing a share and selling short increases the supply of the shares available, when you sell the on the market it creates extra supply, this decreases the price. 

To quote the article you provided as evidence 

“Short sellers, by their nature, drive down the price of a company’s stock.”

“Short-sellers alone do not have the power to hold down the price of a stock for any significant amount of time. They can succeed in doing so in the short term. But the effects won’t last for long.”

I am not saying at all that shorts and shorts alone could bring a company to the ground, unless there was naked shorting involved or the company was truly fraudulent. However, it is completely untrue to suggest the mechanics of a short sell do not temporarily decrease the stock’s price (and your article agrees).",Tackle-Express,3,/r/stocks/comments/o8tpoc/how_does_shorting_affect_a_stock/h37uyec/,0.041,0.846,0.113,0.9869

>Your NVDA is example is not necessarily realistic though, you’re essentially saying you have a limit sell at $300 that you’re sure will get filled.

False. My example was that my NVDA share got filled. You can't take my example while referencing me and then apply different rules. You can make that and make your own example, but not put words into my mouth. I spoke against you saying that selling has to decrease the price which is simply wrong. **EVERY BUY NEEDS A SELL.

>Again referencing point 1. Borrowing a share and selling short increases the supply of the shares available, when you sell the on the market it creates extra supply, this decreases the price.

Short selling means your broker will buy (or borrow) a share until you buy it back. Meaning your made up scenario of having more shares available is simply wrong. Only when you buy back, the share goes back to the market, BUT it also requires someone to buy it. So no, you do not have more shares.

>“Short sellers, by their nature, drive down the price of a company’s stock.”

No no no. Quote the entire thing:

""Short sellers, by their nature, drive down the price of a company’s stock. Executives, on the other hand, are incentivized to drive up the price of their company’s stock.""

What you fail to understand or attempt to represent accurately is that they mean short sellers, the person behind shorting, not the actual short, want to drive the price down. While the CEO, and for that concern anyone on a long position, want to drive the price up. You will never read negative sides on a bull DD and you will never read positive sides on a bear DD. That is natural and stupid to reference out of context.

>“Short-sellers alone do not have the power to hold down the price of a stock for any significant amount of time. They can succeed in doing so in the short term. But the effects won’t last for long.”

Thank you for confirming my point. We are talking about a company filing **bankruptcy**. Having to file for bankruptcy is not something that happens in weeks or a month, this builds up over years.

You what? Listen. A company doesn't give a single frick about what traders do - for their business. They care about what happens to their stock when they **NEED** or **WANT** to raise money. All the other times it literally doesn't matter for the company itself, the entire time. This also belongs to taking a loan and having your stocks, that the company holds, evaluated.

164,NVDA," What the hell has supply and demand to do with this?

If someone shorts a stock, the shares have to be bought first. That straight up negates your entire argument.

>No, I am not saying your one share of AAPL will decrease the stock’s price by any measurable amount but if 50% of AAPL shareholders decided to sell one day, the price would crater.

How can you even write that, thinking this is true? Who do they sell to? The air? No, someone else has to buy it. Every single day someone buys or sells someone else sells or buys. Do you think there is an invisible force that this goes into?

""Source, because you likely won’t believe me:""

This source is flawed majorly - the statements in it are true, but what you fail to understand is that it doesn't matter if stock ABC currently sitting at 100$ has 500 million asks and 500 million bids at 90$ and 110$ - it doesn't do jackshit if there is enough liquidity sitting between 100$ to 110$ and 100 to 90$. What your ""source"" references to is that whenever you have either more demand or more supply, it will move into the opposite direction because it's all about who breaks first, and more people mean it's more likely that this happens. **But that has literally nothing to do with shorting because what this talks about is owning shares and then selling them vs not owning shares and wanting to buy them, thus bid and ask.**

>Your NVDA is example is not necessarily realistic though, you’re essentially saying you have a limit sell at $300 that you’re sure will get filled.

False. My example was that my NVDA share got filled. You can't take my example while referencing me and then apply different rules. You can make that and make your own example, but not put words into my mouth. I spoke against you saying that selling has to decrease the price which is simply wrong. **EVERY BUY NEEDS A SELL. THEY WORK TOGETHER.**

>Again referencing point 1. Borrowing a share and selling short increases the supply of the shares available, when you sell the on the market it creates extra supply, this decreases the price.

Short selling means your broker will buy (or borrow) a share until you buy it back. Meaning your made up scenario of having more shares available is simply wrong. Only when you buy back, the share goes back to the market, BUT it also requires someone to buy it. So no, you do not have more shares.

>“Short sellers, by their nature, drive down the price of a company’s stock.”

No no no. Quote the entire thing:

""Short sellers, by their nature, drive down the price of a company’s stock. Executives, on the other hand, are incentivized to drive up the price of their company’s stock.""

What you fail to understand or attempt to represent accurately is that they mean short sellers, the person behind shorting, not the actual short, want to drive the price down. While the CEO, and for that concern anyone on a long position, want to drive the price up. You will never read negative sides on a bull DD and you will never read positive sides on a bear DD. That is natural and stupid to reference out of context.

>“Short-sellers alone do not have the power to hold down the price of a stock for any significant amount of time. They can succeed in doing so in the short term. But the effects won’t last for long.”

Thank you for confirming my point. We are talking about a company filing **bankruptcy**. Having to file for bankruptcy is not something that happens in weeks or a month, this builds up over years. You have the relation wrong. Shorts don't create a failing business, but a failing business creates shorts.

>I am not saying at all that shorts and shorts alone could bring a company to the ground, unless there was naked shorting involved or the company was truly fraudulent.

What the hell is this even meant to mean? Okay let's digest.

""I am not saying shorts could bring a company down, unless the company was truly fraudulent.""

What? What the hell do shorts have to do with whether the company is fraudulent or not? What hell of a point is that supposed to be?

And second part:

""I am not saying at all that shorts  could bring a company to the ground, unless there was naked shorting involved""

You what? Listen. A company doesn't give a single frick about what traders do - for their business. They care about what happens to their stock when they **NEED** or **WANT** to raise money. All the other times it literally doesn't matter for the company itself, the entire time. This also belongs to taking a loan and having your stocks, that the company holds, evaluated. But again, what you fail to imply is that a failing business causes shorts to come in, not shorts coming in cause a failing business. The topic of the post is still bankruptcy and no, shorts do not have an effect on the share price. Again, by your logic every long position that sells has the same negative effect because the share magically goes back to the market, meaning less supply. Which is simply wrong, someone else is buying it.

**As a final word:**

Supply and demand in shorts matters in 3 cases only:

1. for algorithms. They use the spread to of bid and ask for high frequency trading. This actually does have a major impact on the trading volume, as well as the way it's going
2. who of the bid ask sides breaks first. But bid and ask mostly long positions selling and non-positions buying. So that entire theory doesn't work out for reality.
3. if the float of a stock is either close to or at 100% or the trading volume is insanely low. I've been in stocks that I put up a MARKET ORDER and it wasn't closed for 3 months, so the end where no one is buying or at least enough to cover enough positions that mine is included. And the other end is of course that no one wants to sell.

170,VERY," Think of options as a coupon. let's say your buying a company named PAIR and you buy calls with 2 weeks of time and the current price of PAIR bf buying was $120 a share and you think it will go to $130 a share by the end of the 2 weeks bc of some up coming catalyst.  So you buy 1 options call contract ( coupon) for $2 ($200). Your basically saying hey I think the stock will go above $122 a share or higher by the end of the 2 week period. So naturally this to you is a deal.. So you buy the contract aka coupon. You have no problem paying $12200 ( $122 a share x 100 ) ( all options contacts are in 100 share qts ) by the end of the 2 weeks bc you belive it will be worth $13000 by that time, banking you a gain of $800 total. 

Well let's say the day after you bought your coupon the stock shoots up to $125. Well you know have a coupon that's worth more then when you first bought it. Now ask yourself, would you sell your coupon to me for the same price you bought it for the day bf? No, why? Bc PAIR stock is now currently worth $125 making your coupon more valubale bc PAIR is now worth  $125 or $300 more then what you bought the coupon for. 

So the reason the contract ( the option aka coupon) goes up in value in the short term is bc it's worth more then what it was the day bf. So let's say all of a sudden you don't think Apple will keep going up or you just want to collect the premium. You could sell the option ( aka coupon ) for a $300 gain and be on your way.

Know this can go in reverse just as fast as it went forward. If instead the next day PAIR was at $118 well now your coupon is worthless or worth -$200.. why you ask? Bc who would pay a extra $200 for your coupon when they could go and buy PAIR for $200 cheaper at $118.

Basically you get to collect the premium if you so choose. If you do so you can sell your coupon and ONLY collect the premium that the coupon is worth, not the shares. So you make money bc your coupon is now worth more then what is was when you bought it. 


It's confusing for sure. And this is a VERY VERY basic explanation. There's alot more that goes into it. That's why you should paper trade or read and learn options bf you invest or start playing with them. This feed is full of ppl who lost more then what they could afford bc they dident fully understand how options work. They are complicated. Please, Un.der.stand. bf you dive into them.

249,AMZN," I believe there are at least three (3) parties who would recognize significant strategic gains from an acquisition of Rite Aid:  
  
\*\*\* Amazon ( $AMZN ) \*\*\*  
  
CFRA Research group recently stated (Thursday, June 3, 2021) in its latest Rite Aid (RAD) analysis report:  
  
""It would make more sense for AMZN to acquire a regional drug retailer like RAD to quickly establish a physical presence.""  
  
Also, it should be noted that there is already a partnership existing between Amazon and Rite Aid since July of 2019. Rite Aid was the first partner that Amazon selected for its retail in-store pick-up program called Amazon Counter. Here is the link for the launch of the program:  
  
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-rite-aid/amazon-launches-new-in-store-pickup-option-with-rite-aid-as-first-partner-idUSKCN1TS0RI  
  
So the companies are already coordinating some business activities to a minor extent.  
  
Finally, with the acquisition of Bartell Drugs, Rite Aid became the #1 retail pharmacy in Seattle, WA. Should Amazon buyout Rite Aid, AMZN itself would be able to cut out the middleman and provide cost effective prescription drug benefits to its 75,000 employees at the Seattle headquarters.  
  
\*\*\* Walmart ( $WMT ) \*\*\*  
  
Walmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company. However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens. In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale. If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over. WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.  
  
A couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:  
  
Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions thereby lowering its overall drug cost, improving profitability  
  
All the goods sold in the front-end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products Walmart sells in its own department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.  
  
Based on the above 2 points, Walmart would improve both its own existing margins and at the same time would improve those of the Rite Aid revenue through such an acquisition.  
  
The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.  
  
If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $4 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels. So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payback on the investment.  
  
Whichever company, Walmart or Amazon, utlimately decides to buy Rite Aid, that corporation will instantly become the #3 retail pharmacy in the USA, and will be well-positioned to someday challenge CVS and Walgreens for the #1 or #2 spots.  
  
\*\*\* Walgreens ( $WBA ) \*\*\*  
  
Another darkhorse in this whole race is Walgreens. This week, Walgreens completed the sale of its Alliance Healthcare businesses to AmerisourceBergen for $6.5 billion (---see link below this paragraph). This windfall gives WBA the needed funds to finally finish the takeover of Rite Aid that it started back in 2015. While that deal was ultimately blocked by the courts, no judge could reasonably claim today that there is insufficent competition to support consumers if the balance of Rite Aid was taken over by Walgreens (NOTE: WBA bought 1,900+ RAD stores in 2018, and RAD currently has 2,500+ stores remaining). With CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Kroger, and numberous mail order prescription services (including Amazon), there is pleny of competition in the USA.

\- Blocking both Amazon ( $AMZN ) and Walmart ( $WMT ) from acquiring Rite Aid thereby removing the threat of a financially powerful competitor moving into the #3 retail pharmacy spot in the USA.

255,CVS," LOL ! U know what, that's not a bad thesis to go on. Especially if they struggle to get feet back in the door as areas re-open, I could see a CVS or Walgreens buying them out for the space if we see any of the competition growing rapidly .... definetly something to watch for that I really wasn't thinking about. 

Being in the stock for so long, do you think it was overvalued and headed towards a more realistic price, say, 12.50 ? Or do you think the quarterly reactions got a little carried away and the stock is going to pull back up? I see it sold off from 40 to like 6 bucks a few years ago. OUCH. Don't wanna get caught in something like that. 

When I first saw the sell off i was like, ""Rite Aid? Dude thats goin back up forsure and then I looked at the 4Y chart and listened to an interview w the CEO and now I'm like uuuh idk this might tank from where it was and stay down for awhile.  To be frank I sold an $18 and $17 weekly put on the way down and now im trying to figure out if I should dump the shares on Monday or hold to ride it back up... decisions decisions.",ShroomingMantis,2,/r/stocks/comments/o8o4qb/rad_thoughts_opinions_ideas_feelings_sentiment/h366wky/,0.03,0.873,0.097,0.9267
256,WF," All this assumes that the Whole Foods acquisition has been a success which it really hasn’t been. Amazon barely mentions WF in their quarterly reports despite it being a $16B business. It was a $16B business in 2016 the year before they bought it, so it hasn’t grown at all. They’ve had revenue decline in physical stores 5 out of the last 6 quarters while Target, Walmart, Kroger and Albertsons are putting up double-digit growth. 

It also ignores that Amazon is currently under antitrust scrutiny and pressure to get smaller, not bigger. Rite Aid is close to a penny stock but they are a huge company by revenue. It won’t be allowed.",SmallParade,2,/r/stocks/comments/o8o4qb/rad_thoughts_opinions_ideas_feelings_sentiment/h37lhtr/,0.028,0.881,0.09,0.7108
257,RAD," 2 failed mergers with Walgreens years ago. The FTC claimed it would be a monopoly eliminating the 3rd drug store option and giving WAG too much power in the industry.

The possible buyouts were rumored to come from AMAZON but that is not happening. 

I work for the company and they are lost. 2nd quarter sales are promising, but will be with most retailers as things begin to open , so proceed with caution. I would love to see the company turn itself around but they do not focus on the real issues the company has and instead places a bunch of 'innovative' concepts at the top of the list every few weeks/months just to satisfy shareholders.

They have supply chain issues and distribution centers (at least where I'm at) are unreliable and inefficient. Their PBM is not strong enough to compete with the pricing of WAG CVS and they don't the foothold as a household name in the drug business. People more associate rite aid with thrifty ice cream which is just a cute gimmick to get front end customers to come spend a few bucks.

I will say that it does seem to be another relatively over shorted stock, and these drops are not new. It appears there are massive sell offs at every bit of negative news as it RAD is some company on verge of bankruptcy. They are not, and the price typically rebounds fairly quickly on the announcement of another gimmicky launch.

258,AMZN," First, Whole Foods is in a completely different segment.  You can't compare groceries to pharmacy / convenience goods.  So the Whole Foods experience has no relevance whatsoever to Amazon's intentions in the pharmacy sector.  If Amazon does not go big into pharmacy with an acquisition of Rite Aid or similar, then the Amazon pharmacy business will be destined to fail.  Amazon does not win in a category just by being Amazon.  In pharmacy, you need to be large enough in prescription drugs to be able to negotiate the lowest prices to compete with the likes of CVS , Walgreens , Walmart , etc.  Amazon is not even in the top 15 in the USA in prescription drug sales.   So AMZN either goes big, or they drop out and go home in this category.

Second, your entire depiction of antitrust concerns is incorrect.  The US government's use of antitrust laws is to ensure that monopolies are not created and that there is healthy competition to provide consumers with multiple options at fair prices.  Once again, Amazon has not been able to crack into the top 15 in the USA in pharmacy.  By acquiring Rite Aid with the goal of building that business out, Amazon would essentially create the 3rd pure national retail pharmacy in the USA, along with CVS and Rite Aid.  This would increase competition in the space, not decrease it.  So, Amazon could easily make an argument that taking a small regional business and growing it into a national pharmacy would be very good for the market, giving consumers more choices and increased price competition.   And we all know that lower prices for prescription drugs is a national goal of the US government.",Michael_Therami,1,/r/stocks/comments/o8o4qb/rad_thoughts_opinions_ideas_feelings_sentiment/h38740k/,0.064,0.793,0.143,0.9469

271,BABA," With Fidelity, I believe when you buy a stock with your cash- 40k, it is settled in your account and that 40k becomes a marginable position. Ex.: BABA (m)
And that should give you 40k margin, total 80k buying power.

If you had 1k left over and made another 20k purchase on margin, I believe it would be interest free on margin, and they would not touch your 1k. 

If you then added 99k, I believe they would fill your margin, leaving you with 80k in cash reserves, 60k in holdings, and 140k buying power, so total 180k with margin.

The first probably 100K/140k of your purchases would end up being interest free- or 30k of interest free margin, with the final 50k margin at an annual interest rate of 6.575% due to having more than 100k in the account

That said, I'm not saying they're bad investements either. I'd pick EA or TTWO over ATVI, because they've got more room to expand their overall business imho. I personally also have a bit more faith in both EA and TTWO's, game development pipeline, overall business strategy & diversity and management vs. ATVI.

Something to take into account is that some forms of microtransactions like lootboxes might face some regulatory headwinds in some countries, which could impact revenue and profit. (I don't object the opposition to lootboxes at all, it's a very questionable business model, but it's something to take into account if you invest in a company like EA, because a lot of their revenue comes from FIFA Ultimate Team)

Nintendo seems like the most attractive one based on the valuation, but their management is a bit too conservative for my likings (not necessarily a bad thing, but just something I take into account when looking at the valuation). Nintendo is a great company though: they're highly profitable, have very little overhead (they generate incredible amounts of revenue of profit relative to the capital that their business requires), their games have an enormous reach and they also have an incredibly die-hard fanbase that's also very monetizable. I consider Nintendo a very low-risk investment, but with limited upside potential for the mid-term. So overall, Nintendo stock is pretty solid, just don't expect too much from it on the short-term and mid-term.

Ubisoft looks pretty interesting in terms of valuation when you look at the P/S ratio, but their profitability leaves a lot too be desired. They lack the reliable/recurring cash-cows that EA (FIFA/FUT, Battlefield), ATVI (COD, COD Mobile, Candy Crush, WoW), TTWO (GTA V, NBA2K) have so you're more dependent on Ubisoft's ability to bring out hits in the future. If you believe in Ubisoft's ability to bring out big hits going forward, then they're the gaming stock to own imho.

Ubisoft also has an enormous amount of employees on payroll: 19 000 employees which is by far the largest of any gaming company. Despite this, they kind of struggle to bring out the reliable and highly profitable big hitters that their competitors are able to pump out with a much lower employee count.

If I had to pick one gaming-related stock it would be Sony by far and away because of the strength of their gaming brand (PlayStation obviously), profitability, outlook and extremely attractive valuation (Sony Group EV/EBITDA = 8, based on their mid-term target), though it's obviously not a a pure gaming stock. Their aim to expand the reach of their IP's with mobile games, and also porting first-party games to PC and expand their PlayStation Network (partnership with Discord) beyond just console also seems very interesting. They also have a lot of great developers and their business has little overhead.

Only thing I don't really like about Sony's PlayStation business right now is the loss-leading console model especially: scalpers are making huge amounts of profits by reselling PS5's, but Sony is taking a sizeable loss on each PS5 they sell. It's a pretty weird situation to be in for them and goes to show that the market would easily have supported a slightly higher PS5 price. But hindsight is 20/20 and overall it's a good thing that PS5 turned out to be a phenomenom.

Despite this, they kind of struggle to bring out the reliable and highly profitable big hitters that their competitors are able to pump out with a much lower employee count.

If I had to pick one gaming-related stock it would be Sony by far and away because of the strength of their gaming brand (PlayStation obviously), profitability, outlook and extremely attractive valuation (Sony Group EV/EBITDA = 8, based on their mid-term target), though it's obviously not a a pure gaming stock. Their aim to expand the reach of their IP's with mobile games, and also porting first-party games to PC and expand their PlayStation Network (partnership with Discord) beyond just console also seems very interesting. They also have a lot of great developers and their business has little overhead.

Only thing I don't really like about Sony's PlayStation business right now is the loss-leading console model especially: scalpers are making huge amounts of profits by reselling PS5's, but Sony is taking a sizeable loss on each PS5 they sell. It's a pretty weird situation to be in for them and goes to show that the market would easily have supported a slightly higher PS5 price. But hindsight is 20/20 and overall it's a good thing that PS5 turned out to be a phenomenom.

I think they also could PlayStation could been a bit more agressive with content acquisitions. Capcom was struggling financially 5-10 years ago and would have been a great (and inexpensive) acquisition for their IP alone.

283,TTWO," Most of them are overpriced right now imho. Ubisoft, ATVI, EA, TTWO obviously were all fantastic investments 5-10 years ago, but you're not getting a good deal if you buy them right now.

That said, I'm not saying they're bad investements either. I'd pick EA or TTWO over ATVI, because they've got more room to expand their overall business imho. I personally also have a bit more faith in both EA and TTWO's, game development pipeline, overall business strategy & diversity and management vs. ATVI.

Something to take into account is that some forms of microtransactions like lootboxes might face some regulatory headwinds in some countries, which could impact revenue and profit. (I don't object the opposition to lootboxes at all, it's a very questionable business model, but it's something to take into account if you invest in a company like EA, because a lot of their revenue comes from FIFA Ultimate Team)

Nintendo seems like the most attractive one based on the valuation, but their management is a bit too conservative for my likings (not necessarily a bad thing, but just something I take into account when looking at the valuation). Nintendo is a great company though: they're highly profitable, have very little overhead (they generate incredible amounts of revenue of profit relative to the capital that their business requires), their games have an enormous reach and they also have an incredibly die-hard fanbase that's also very monetizable. I consider Nintendo a very low-risk investment, but with limited upside potential for the mid-term. So overall, Nintendo stock is pretty solid, just don't expect too much from it on the short-term and mid-term.

Ubisoft looks pretty interesting in terms of valuation when you look at the P/S ratio, but their profitability leaves a lot too be desired. They lack the reliable/recurring cash-cows that EA (FIFA/FUT, Battlefield), ATVI (COD, COD Mobile, Candy Crush, WoW), TTWO (GTA V, NBA2K) have so you're more dependent on Ubisoft's ability to bring out hits in the future. If you believe in Ubisoft's ability to bring out big hits going forward, then they're the gaming stock to own imho.
