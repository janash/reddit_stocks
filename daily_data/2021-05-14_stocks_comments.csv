0,ONE," Panic selling is a Hedge Funds/Investments funds golden goose and people fall for it every time.

Monday- Things got bad, people started to freak  
Tuesday- Full melt down mode, the END OF THE WORLD!  
Wednesday- Bears are on top and the ""huge"" bubbles are about to pop  
Thursday- What, its not the end of the world?  
Friday- Everything is great again!

Didn't sell ONE share this week, only bought and  now I'm back up and in the green on all three of my trades.

Lesson, ""End of the world"" events only happen every 20-100 years give or take, these ""dips"" happen all the time and are normal. Stop falling for the fear bating every time after earnings when funds are looking to cash out/drop the price and then buy back at a lower price when panic selling ensues.",Temporary-Repeat-874,61,/r/stocks/comments/ncajlk/dont_worry_about_the_green_days/gy41fxa/,0.159,0.803,0.038,-0.9499

You can have “end of the world” personal events in a huge bull market if you don’t know how to play the game or make a few wrong moves but we both know that wasn’t what I was trying to convey though.

We just had one of these events last year, Bears have to come to terms with this, no big crashes are coming anytime soon. Maybe down the road when things get back to normal and demand slows and all this money is out of the system will see a contraction but until then enjoy the ride and make some money.",Temporary-Repeat-874,-1,/r/stocks/comments/ncajlk/dont_worry_about_the_green_days/gy4aief/,0.05,0.868,0.083,0.5647

Yeah if we just take into account the last 21 years, what if we take from 1950-2021? or 1850-2021? We just had our first Pandemic in 100 years, we haven't had a Depression in the US in almost 100 years.

Never said they didn't, my point was End of the world events don't happen that often and we shouldn't live our lives thinking the next big one is always around the corner and the odds of two black swan events happening back to back is mathematically improbable(not that it can't happen).

18,TSLA," Idk all of the tickers you have picked out, but on first glance I'm not overly concerned about your portfolio's long-term performance. I see people with most of their portfolio in a single growth-centric industry (i.e. TSLA, NIO) and I can only imagine how heavy the bags are getting.  
  
Will things keep getting worse over the next few months? Quite possibly, yes. If that concerns you, perhaps sell your weakest convictions and store it in a broad-market index fund to ride it out.  
  
The one thing I'd warn you is to try and not catch a falling knife and overcompensate by putting more and more into a falling stock. Be mindful of your diversification and be patient. If you haven't already, do more research on your current stocks and build confidence in a target price of yours.

I mean, cool, I don't have anything against ETFs, but for me that means that the person doing that went into investing with the wrong strategy in the first place.   


I got like -20% portfolio atm (started invisting 4 months ago). And I would love to panic about it, but the fact that I will invest for next 20 years, sometimes take profit, makes me relaxed because I know 4 months are not that much of a time period to make conclusions.   


Tbh I fell more bad because of last 3 months profit in crypto (100%+),  witch is only 30% of my portfolio, and the 70% in stocks are down 20%.

Even if we don't ascribe a sort of conspiracy to the powers that be that rule the market (I do think a handful of tutes and their algos exercise inordinate power over the market using things like order flows gleaned from Robinhood), the fact is that one sector got overbought. Seriously overbought. Rotation happened. 

Reasons were given, parroted endlessly by financial media: inflation, rate hike hysteria, reopening, etc. All kind of after the fact like Cramer shouting at retail.

Now another group of sectors is seriously overbought (look at $SEAS lmao). Rotation back will happen. But only when the prices have gotten cheap enough for big boys to load up. We need full capitulation in the oversold sectors, though. And then we'll see the reasons -- ""oh, it was short term price inflation due to stimulus and reopening and supply shock! inflation not a thing, and Fed reassured us about rates all along!""

A lot of us were touting $1+ eoy (when it wasn't consolidated) they are definitely still on track for that. Do your own DD. Their values are solid, they have their foot in the door in the US market after purchasing FabCBD (80% bought, 3 years to purchase the other 20%) they are one of the biggest online retailers, they are supported by Aphira (now Tilray after their merger) they are opening retail locations in tourist destinations left and right (think 80+ stores right now) and they have passed most of the NASDAQ checks and plan to launch out of otc to mainstream by end of month.

If US goes full legal like everyone thinks the Biden administration will do. This thing will explode. Even if US doesn't they are fucking solid and worth at least $1 a share in my book (or $15 a share under current consolidation) Raj Grover is a fucking mastermind

116,IBM," Just look up IOS vs Android market share on your favorite search engine and find recent data. They have been shrinking for a while now. Though there is some variation, the trend line is definitely down for several years. This is not news.

As for entrenched, hard to say. Phones are not enterprise productivity devices aside from the common communication usage. Further, its not like there is a killer app on the iphone that you cant get on android or any other phone OS. You can argue consumers are entrenched in itunes in many cases so there is definitely some consumer pull with that but question is whether or not that valuable enough. I am not sure. Again its not enterprise. 

I look at it like Facebook. Is it entrenched? I dont think so. I just dont think the stuff I have in there is very valuable at all. The pics are really backups and my friends list is all over my phones anyway. The friends not on my phone arent really friends and I can lose then at any time. So is it really entrenched? I am not sure.

And then you also have to ask, even if the entrenchment lasts, can Apple keep growing and at what pace? Certainly the past 5 years have been much slower than the 5 prior. This is the problem of being consumer heavy. Enterprise, unlike consumer services, happily pays more every year for services as long as the price is less than cost of training for new software. But consumers dont have to worry about that. They dont care. So convincing them to pay more every year is a hard sell.

Still like Apple, but just saying. Its not all roses. Apple can become the next IBM and just go sideways for a long time. It will come down to how they spend that cash.",thejumpingsheep2,2,/r/stocks/comments/nbtk08/anyone_else_just_plan_on_hunkering_down_and/gy3rh98/,0.119,0.786,0.095,-0.6776

No one company dominates their market forever. KO has had poor returns for a while now, and if you owned their stock over the last decade, you're likely well behind the market.

158,AI," 1st of all separate the hype from reality. The hype the last 20 years is every ipo wants to somehow be a tech company. So everyone is calling themselves tech. Its semantics and not reflective of reality.

2nd, understand that AI is not really AI. It was redefined the last 10 years or so to include things that traditional were not considered AI. They are simply statistics. Thats all. We analyze stats then program a computer to do something specific. There is absolutely no intelligence involved. ML is not AI and never will be. It can lead to AI one day but on its own it isnt. Think about the cells of your body. They have functions. They are important. Are they intelligent? No they arent. Will they ever be intelligent? Nope. So why do companies go out of their way to claim AI? See #1 above.

3rd, if you dont work in tech, you really shouldnt be talking about tech. All software companies work with data. Size of data isnt really as big of a deal as people make it out to be. ""Big Data"" is just marketing hype and has been for at least a decade now. There was a time when processing large data was hard. That was 20-50 years ago... big data means nothing now. Its literally trivial to do and cheap especially when we are talking non-science researchy stuff.

Last, know your industry. What exactly do you think all the other defense contractors do these days? Manufacture weapons? Nope. Mostly software services... aka they put a GUI on data. Exactly the same thing these guys are doing. I was doing similar work for Raytheon more than 10 years ago at Irwin.

Summary: They are a plain old defense contractor. Nothing wrong with that, but they are not really a tech company unless you count all the other defense contractors as ""tech."" Semantics...

Lots of land has been burnt in the seasonal forest fires, I'd expect we'll have another burn unless this is a very wet summer...

Gloabal supply can't meet the NA demands, we're usually a net exporter and they suffer similar problems with land rights, pests, and fires.

The semiconductor manufacturers are selling all of their capacity to the miners, because it is profitable to mine right now, and they are paying top dollar for the chips.  For that reason supply will be constrained limiting the growth of companies that have not already secured manufacturing time in the foundries.  

In the past this has been the case with CPU's and GPU's but with the growth of ARM as a general purpose ISA,it is affecting Electric vehicles, regular vehicles, and even the companies that make semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

I know a lot about the company and have been involved 4 years or more.

I have made a car off ACB(3K) and Canopy(5K). I reinvested in ACB because of their aggressive growth philosophy. They were the #1 legal producers in the world. Demand was bottle necked in Canada for the ability to buy at the retail level. They didn't allow as many stores to sell as the government proposed. They had a lot of medical throughout the world and bought many companies with stock all along the way.

The thing is, the dilution of stock, managing these companies and direction is hard. Thanks, Terry!!

But, the infrastructure is there and yes they did have to contract because they were making a f\*ck ton of premium weed and discovered that there was the retail side that was either bottle necked or over priced due to taxation vs the local illegal weed guy.

Jeanine Wai -- Barclays -- Analyst

Hi, good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. My first question probably maybe for Rob. I just want to make sure I heard your comments right in the prepared remarks.

So getting down to the mid-20 billion range on gross debt, that's where you think you need to be to hit IG status at mid-cycle prices. And I think ultimately, that's an important goal for you all. So about 10 billion more to go from there. Can you just remind us what your view of mid-cycle prices are at this point? And how does this jive with your prior target of three times leverage as the trigger for growth, which I think was also at mid-cycle prices?

Rob Peterson -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes. It's around the $50 range. And if you look at the price decks that are being used by a lot of rate agencies, they're in the high 40s right now to look to close to $50. They're not -- so they don't move their price decks with the current environment of being in the mid- to high -- low 60s.

And so that makes a significant difference on where that breakeven location is at. And so is it exactly 20 -- $10 billion? Obviously, there's a lot of different things to factor, as I indicated in my remarks, but it's somewhere in the neighborhood of that. It's somewhere -- other things will go into that. It could mitigate it to be a little higher than that would be possible or even a little lower than that.

But obviously, there's a lot of things that go into it, but it's somewhere in that range. So even though that you can probably move forward and get pretty close to that or lower that three times in your model for the second half of the year. But by the end of the year, based on -- if current oil prices were to continue, it's not that price deck that we're going to be considered for investment-grade.""",VersusYYC,1,/r/stocks/comments/nc2kt9/oxywhat_reduction_of_debt_or_fcf_is_needed_to_get/gy3mj5n/,0.045,0.902,0.053,0.2848

407,MMM," My personal advice is unless you’re going to be actively researching things and reading earnings reports and stuff - stick it in an ETF and keep adding to it.

ETF= Exchange Traded Fund. It’s a basket of stocks that you invest in the basket, not individual stocks. That basket holds things like Apple, Microsoft, Target, Walmart, Pepsi, MMM, Home Depot, etc - think the biggest companies and brands you see and use regularly. But you aren’t picking and choosing individual stocks. You’re capping your upside, but you’re also heavily limiting your downside. Generally when someone says “the market is up” they’re talking about the S&P.

I am pretty heavy in QQQM - which mirrors the NASDAQ (tech heavy - biggest holdings are: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Tesla, NVidia, PayPal, and Comcast). I think tech is the future and will continue to grow exponentially over the next 30 years.

Of course - the S&P holds those stocks as well - but at a lower percentage of their holdings.

QQQM has 11.2% of their holdings are Apple (their largest holding), VOO meanwhile has 5.74% of their holdings in Apple (their largest holding).",Washedup11,1,/r/stocks/comments/ncege4/retirement_plan/gy4ort9/,0.028,0.908,0.065,0.7269
408,DOW," Well the 7% return is based on the S&P 500 Index. A grouping of 500 of the largest companies in the US.

That tends to be considered safe. It’s also not likely to go up 70% in a year like some handpicked stocks might. It also won’t go down 70% like some individual stocks might.

Another index is the NASDAQ - which is 100 tech stocks

The DJIA is 30 companies.

S&P - being 500 companies - tends to be the most “safe” of the three. But generally speaking - if you’re in an ETF that follows any of those three - you’re being fairly conservative.

There are ETF’s that mirror those indices. You’ll see SPY and VOO (S&P), QQQ (NASDAQ), and j honestly don’t know any ETF’s that track the DOW. They exist - but I’m in S&Ps and NASDAQ. 

Again - generally speaking - if you’re in an ETF that mirrors one of these three - you’re being fairly safe and conservative.

409,CVX," I'm not interested in where ""my"" money goes when my specific portfolio loses value. Looking at it in the aggregate, there is a flow of value in and out of certain products that is reflective of the price of those products. When the total value of the stock market goes down it is because there has been a transfer of money at lower valuations of the underlying asset than previously. More selling pressure. That decrease in value is equal to the money transacted that did not then flow back into another stock asset. After-all, the DOW doesn't move at all if I sell $1000 CVX and buy $1000 XOM (Note: This requires some assumptions about price discovery and liquidity, but I think the assumptions are fair).

So, if the total value of all stocks goes down that value extraction must go somewhere. Immediately it is deposited in the accounts of investors in the form of money, but then ... is it put right back in the market, or does it go into other assets like commodities, real estate, commercial products paid for by that money?

Think or Swim app is the same as AmeritradeTD so your portfolios are the same in both apps, one is just more suited of options. (You have to buy full shares here, I think, no partial stocks) Same log in for both apps as well. 

I initiated a full account transfer through Ameritrade TD and it will take 4-5 business days to complete. I started yesterday and my RobinHood account is already deactivated. I got emails from both stating transfer is in process.
