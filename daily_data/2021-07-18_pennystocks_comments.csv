6,PDT," They are very up front on how they profit from trades. They even have it in their FAQ on how lol (payment by order flow)

They only charge commissions during PM and after a certain amount of shares, which if you have a small account or even slightly above PDT, youll be fine. They only charge up to .003/share when they do chargew for commissions. They have great amount of locates if you want to short as well, which is why I'm with them.

Their Fills and executions are pretty fast... Once you're above 50K you can use direct access routes, which is the only down side to them.",TradingForCharity,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/omjwut/whats_the_best_investment_app_for_penny_stocks/h5nxurj/,0.0,0.813,0.187,0.9612
