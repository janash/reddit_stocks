5,ETH," Huge catalyst for Coinbase is going to be EIP 1559 + the migration to proof of stake. Why?

Coinbase offers PoS for its customers (offering up to 6% of a return). However, validators can earn \_substantially\_ more than that (some estimates up to 25%) - pending the migration to proof of stake and the addition of fees (30% of fees that aren't burned) being paid to validators.

That spread is just accumulating to Coinbase. 19% of staked ETH on Coinbase accumulating to Coinbase... who can either hold or sell or lend.

20,APR," A new revenue stream they aren't mentioning is staking. Besides traditional proof of work systems like BTC there are currencies that operate or are transitioning to operate as a proof of stake system where instead of mining, the blockchain is updated by staked nodes.

With Ethereum 2 staked nodes process transactions and in exchange receive 7.9% APR. In order to operate an Ethereum 2 node you need 32 Ether which as of right now would cost roughly 80k. If you don't have 80k in Ether you can now use Coinbase which has staking pools where you can stake your Ether in exchange for 6% APR and they keep 1.9% of everyone's staked Ether for operating the nodes.

41,MA," There is plenty but it's all content that I pay for so nothing really I can link you. It's gonna be hard to explain why I'm confident it's going back up without writing an essay...but I'll give it a go. 

First of all while it was quite a substantial crash recently, it was not unexpected. I thought we'd be trading between 40-50k for a few months but instead it looks like we'll be between 30-40k. The growth so far this year was not sustainable. We were far too extended from the 20 week MA. Last cycle we rode it all the way up until a blow off top. The cycle before, in 2013, we got too far extended & when we finally tested it, we fell below it, that was the forming of the first peak in a double peak cycle. Then we had months of consolidation before blasting off again, reaching a blow off top & then a sustained bear market. 

A similar thing just happened. We were so far above the 20 week that when we tested it we fell below it. Falling below it means alt coins get wrecked. Part of the reason you see so much fear online & in r/cryptocurrency is because a surprising amount of people own no BTC & go all in on alts. Which is a terrible idea. When BTC drops significantly the alts get destroyed & people who thought they were getting rich quick start to panic because they're losing money badly. There are even more similarities between 2013 & now. The guy I mainly get my content off has been predicting a double peak cycle for months now & he's not the only one. The intra-cycle volatility between this cycle & the last has been very similar to what occurred between 2013 & the one before it, which is where the suspicions of a double peak originally came from & so far it's playing out. 

I realise all of this probably is worthless without charts so I'll move on.

The asset class is maturing & things are of course overvalued, but they're been way more overvalued at times in the past. There is very clearly diminishing returns & reduced volatility over time, but it's years off reaching a stage where it flattens out. The utility in crypto improves year after year & Blockchain is an industry disrupting technology for many industries. I'm not a bitcoin maximalist but I am a crypto maximalist & the likes of xxx, XXX & xxx are going nowhere for years to come. Most alts are worthless but during a bear market the ones that actually do something tend to be ridiculously undervalued (xxx at 2c last year now at 1.5 & previously well over 2, xxx at 0.002 last year now at 0.10 & previously at 0.28.)
Then in a bull market they get ridiculously overvalued. Overall the asset class reached I think a 4x from its previous cycle peak when BTC was at 60k. Even with diminishing returns that is well below what anyone predicted. There was also no blow off top which will come at some stage. A period where greed reaches its peak, instead we just put in new ATHs 3k above the previous for a few months before the crash.

II interest is not going away & has only been increasing in the past few months but what investor wants to buy a 60k BTC? The likes of Grayscale & MicroStrategy will, but their average buy is already way lower than most else & they're in it for the real long haul. To move to 100k IIs are needed & those who were interested but didn't act because the price is too high for an entry point. Now they've got a great entry point below the average buy of the likes of Tesla. 

I'm gonna stop now, I'm sure if you have no interest in crypto then it seems like nonsense rambling but if you see BTC hit 100k or more then know that during the bear market that follows, whenever it comes, you have a great opportunity to buy undervalued solid projects & make fantastic returns.

Crypto has grown because knowledge of it grew. I got started with it in 2013 and back then no one knew what it was. You went to message boards, and there was lots of discussion about the technology behind blockchains and purpose. If I told anyone about crypto, they looked at me like I was a nutjob/falling for a scam.

Fast forward to 2021, and EVERYONE knows what crypto is. You have celebrities selling NFTs and people paying millions for them, and apps like RH making it super easy to 1 click buy without having to handle setting up a wallet, backups, etc, and institutional involvement as well. You have Coinbase running ads saying ""If you bought bitcoin 10 years ago instead of that coffee you'd be a millionaire now"". Obviously these returns have drawn people in seeking to get rich quick. It's not a pyramid scheme as it's just a decentralized technology, but its valuation effectively functions like one.

Go to any message board, the boards are flooded with people talking about price.

57,TAP," Hello there!

I wouldn't know why investors do not seem to like ICAGY as much as other (especially US airlines), but here some food for your thoughts and evaluations:

* Europe is behind the US in vaccination, the majority of EU countries won't finish their vaccination before August/September. That of course reduces margins for recovery of airlines and other tourism-related business.
* It is expected that work travel for business meetings, fairs,  conventions, etc. will be impacted long-term. In Europe for medium-distance travel, fast railways are a viable alternative. Some governments such as France are also planning to ban domestic flights where a fast-train alternative exists for environmental reasons (of course this is France and not the UK or Spain, but it gives an idea of some policies floating around here in Europe).
* As part of the recovery plans approved by EU governments, there has been also some direct help for their main airlines. This has pushed some competitors to file suit to the EU General Court, as according to them these measures may infringe competition rules. In one case in particular the General Court sided with the plaintiff (Ryanair) against KLM (Dutch airline) and TAP (Portuguese airline). [Reuters article here](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/eu-court-backs-ryanair-challenge-klm-tap-state-aid-2021-05-19/).
* In January, Iberia bought distressed airline Air Europa. The Antitrust approved the deal (to be completed this summer), but it also demanded Iberia cede certain route slots they had in common with Air Europa to avoid creating quasi-monopoly for those routes. Moreover, Air Europa did receive more than € 400M in state aid last year and the Spanish government is still financing part of Iberia costs by contributing to personnel salaries (an employment protection instrument called ERTE in Spain). Competitors might asks the courts to assess whether those aids are still *kosher* given the merger.
* Last but not least, Europe has much stronger social protection for workers. That means that big companies such as Iberia could not simply lay off personnel in 2020 and wait for better times.

To sum all this up, analysts think that air traffic won't resume its pre-pandemic volumes before 2024 here in Europe. I have no basis nor knowledge to assess how accurate these estimations may be.

My two, very personal, cents is that the current price is probably undervaluing the company, but also that post-pandemic effects, coupled with consumers' behavior and sentiment changes, will prevent European airlines to soar again for quite some time.",pablochs,18,/r/investing/comments/njunge/whats_the_deal_with_icagy/gz9gdqf/,0.043,0.898,0.059,0.7898

Wash sale rules just mean you won't be able to claim capital losses - the strategy will need to work without help from the tax system in that sense.

92,APR," So, I'm currently involved in a crypto protocol that pays me fees over time based on underlying principal, but those fees are not automatically reinvested.

If you're familiar with crypto, you'll understand that reinvesting that amount into the principal costs fees on its own.Are there calculators that can tell me the optimal timing of reinvestment, assuming constant APR and with reinvestment fees as the variable(s)?  It seems like something that equity markets would already have as a calculator.  It's like wanting to DRIP but it costs a flat fee to reinvest, so too often would spend too many fees and too seldom would fail to maximize compounding.  


For example, let's say I have 100k earning 20% APR, except what's earned accumulates in a separate account.  It would cost 100$ flat to reinvest the entirety of the accumulated amount.

93,API," ERRFY (Eurofin's ADR) was delisted on May 11th of 12th

Hello everyone. I have had close to a 1000 of units of ERRFY since some time in 2020. These units were located in two separate brokerages - Wells Fargo and Fidelity.

I  noticed that my own Google Spreadsheet stopped returning quotes for ERRFY, but I just assumed it was a temporarily glitch, of which Google Finance API had plenty. However, it seems that the ADR is now non-existent. I found no news to the matter by searching online.

Last Friday, I called Wells Fargo, and a trader listened to me and said ""I don't see any issues with this ticker"". I then asked him to put one unit for sale, which he was able to do. However, a couple of minutes later, that order was cancelled. I later received a voicemail from the trader, saying that ""the ticket seems no longer listed in the US"".

Has anyone every run into this situation before? What are my options?

I am yet to reach out to Fidelity, but I'm going to call Well Fargo the second time today.

Appreciate any inputs! Thank you.",new_optimist_7a,1,/r/investing/comments/njtgdu/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gzatu9b/,0.05,0.865,0.085,0.7052

98,DCF," The main differentiating factor is that the inputs to cost of capital for different companies can differ widely enough that it could cause significant variation in your discounted estimates of free cash flow.

And as we start to look at cash flow 5, 10 years out, this error gets magnified.  Imagine that you thought the fair value was $100 per share and that at $80 it's a bargain.  But let's say you've flubbed cost of capital.  So your discount factor for 10 years of free cash flow is going to then be off considerably and that 20% discount actually ends up being a premium.

Margin of safety protects us when we are reasonably solid on our DCF analysis.  It can't protect us if our foundational assumptions are wrong.",th3cr1t1c,6,/r/investing/comments/nk0n2u/how_complex_does_a_dcf_model_need_to_be/gzaryin/,0.062,0.772,0.166,0.8753

100,DCF, We use EPS estimates to analyze if their trend supports the current price instead of DCF.

101,IRR," You can come up with an estimated IRR for an investment fairly simply if you've done the work.

Maybe a business where you know the market will grow 3% organically (1% population growth, 2% pricing), maybe there's a runway to get 3% from M&A, with some margin expansion from operating leverage.

102,UK," As far as currency risk affecting your USD-denominated returns is concerned, your portfolio is probably well suited to mitigate it. If the USD weakens, your international allocations will benefit. It gets a bit more complicated when talking about converting back to your home currency. Vanguard has done some research about currency risk’s contribution to the volatility of returns and found that it doesn’t predictably increase or decrease volatility. Over the observed period, unhedged portfolios had lower volatility than hedged portfolios in the US and UK, but higher than in Canada and Australia. So currency hedging may not meaningfully mitigate that risk. Increasing your domestic allocation would meaningfully reduce volatility associated with exchange rates, but you’re then essentially changing your entire investment strategy and betting much bigger on your home country’s market. I can’t say whether that’s a good or a bad thing, I am not familiar enough with the Philippine’s market to say. I would start by looking at the volatility of your domestic market (as denominated in PHP). If it’s much more volatile than VTI/VXUS, you might just be trading one driver of volatility for another.

109,MSCI," Your portfolio allocation should be based on your goals. 

Want to get your annual ~7% long term? Stick to your typical MSCI World ETF and you'll be fine. If you're concerned about the US Dollar, maybe put that moeny in ETFs that are priced in EUR for example.

Want to put less money on the US market? Well you can certainly do that with regional ETFs, just look at the unstoppable S&P500 the past decades. Hard to beat that, looking back.

Want to (try to) outperform the market? We'll for me I put a big chunk of my portfolio on a few selected German companies (I'm from there) that I feel like I have a better insight into and that I hope will outperform the market. Ofc that means more work for research. Maybe you have reason to believe that a certain countries economy is going to go full bull run fairly soon? Put your money there. If you have that insight. Live with the risk of underperformance. 

You don't want to put all your money into stocks? Fair enough. Real Estate and Gold should also be fine long term. Ofc with less expectes results in terms if performance. What you get is more safety. Looking back, you would have been better of (again, longterm) with just stocks.

114,UK," TL;DR: Real exposure doesn't depend in what currency you buy the stock.

Most gold mines are not located in USA. So you aren't really exposed to dollars. You think you are because your broker calculates a simplified exposure based on the currency you bought the stock with, it is a simple calculation, but incorrect.

For exemple if you buy 10 shares of the German Bundesbank in the New York stock exchange your broker says you are exposed to dollars, if you buy 10 shares of the German Bundesbank in the German stock market it will say you are exposed to Euro. But in both cases you hold the exact same stock and your exposure is the same.

Real exposure depends on where the company assets are located, the currency the customers pay with and the currency the suppliers are paid with, and many other things. Not what currency you used to buy the stock. In fact with gold you have an inverse exposure to the dollar, and with gold mines you have leverage on that.

&#x200B;

If you don't trust the US system (ETF and exchanges) there are a lot of great gold mines in London and yu could make your own ETF-like mix. But again their assets are not in UK, so you will be exposed to foreign currencies even if your broker say you are not.",Fruity_Pineapple,3,/r/investing/comments/nk2e5h/gold_etf_fx_conversion_conundrum_what_to_do/gzajpv3/,0.021,0.889,0.09,0.9245
