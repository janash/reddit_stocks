2,BBIG," If the reverse merger is already announced that should be priced in. There even in mergers there is always a winner and a loser, depending on how they structure the deal there is a consideration paid (in which case the stock would already be around that price upon announcement) or there is some exchange rate of stock where 1 BBIG is worth X of the other stock. If the other company is larger it is likely the BBIG shareholders will get diluted from inequitable exchange rate.

6,DD," Nah man, too complicated:

IMO, DD is to answer: ""Is this company undervalued?""

You can't understand how a business works inside and out because filings and public information will not provide the depth you need. You can only guess at a certain point. You can see how flawed some of the DD gets on here and how it just becomes hype when you have to fill the gaps with subjectivity. 

You can simplify a lot of the research by answering these questions instead:

""is the company making money?""

""if not, will the company eventually make money?""

""If they will eventually make money, am i willing to hold until they do?""

as for product:

""Is the product released?""

""If not, how long will it be until its released?""

""Does the product offering provide substantial benefit or value compared to other products in-market?""

""If the product is not released, will i be willing to hold until commercialization?""

and to wrap it up

operations;

""Is the company profitable?""

""if so, how profitable?""

""does their profitability justify the current SP?""

""If not, will they be profitable""

""If they will eventually be profitable, am i willing to hold until then?""

25,ALOT," XELA seems to be getting the love here that ATOS got last month. As in there are ALOT of people buying/talking about it. 

Here is what I have to say about that personally 

Scenario 1) you already own the stock. 


Prepare an exit strategy for both positive and negative days. If you have a position and it starts skyrocketing this week. Have a set price In your head you think would be a good price to sell at that you would be like “heck ya I turned $300 into $600” in real life if you did that at the blackjack table you would be very happy about this win.   So let’s say your mental happy place is $5 a share.  When Xela Hits $5 a share set what is called “a trailing stop loss”. Every single broker has one. 
When you place one for 3% if the stock goes from 5->5.50 without dropping 3% from the high you don’t sell at all you ride the wave up. If it then goes down to 5.40 then to -> 6 you still don’t sell you still ride that wave. Then stock drops to 5.75 from there your trailing stop sells and you sell out of however many shares you wanted to sell. Don’t have to sell everything but it’s good to secure profits.    Then from there you can take some emotion out of the play and decide if you want to chase the moon with remaining shares or just cash them all in. 

Now let’s say instead of green, stock tanks tomorrow have a plan then. Do you stop loss your way out? Do you HOLD and pray for recovery? Set up a mental plan for whatever you feel best fits how you would treat this money if you had it in cash in front of your face.  Because guess what it literally is your cash money.  Don’t forget that. Never forget that.  If you’re fine with it crashing in order to chase moon that’s fine too have fun with it.  If you wanna save some cash for the next spicy play set up stop losses and wait for next big runner. 




Scenario 2). You don’t own the stock yet. 

I’ll make this one shorter 

Enter with starter positions and have liquidity available to buy into dips that may occur either during the day or during the week.  If you yolo 100% portfolio $1000 in at $3.50 your avg is $3.50 and you have no cash to buy a dip.  If you open up say $350 into $3.50 and it dips to say .. $3 you can buy up 100 more shares and move your avg to $3.25 and make higher profits if the stock jumps up again. 


Or just save cash and wait for next rocket ship to jump on. 




For the record I got in at $1.95 and sold 50% at $3 on trailing and $2.50 at stop loss  so I’m already in and out and hope everyone holding makes tendies too. 



Either way I hope these comments I leave daily help some people. I don’t want to come across as a know it all, I really genuinely don’t. I just wanna make sure new traders don’t get hurt too bad. It’s more fun when we all make cash.",LeoFireGod,21,/r/pennystocks/comments/oj76y2/the_loungedaily_plays_july_13_2021/h506hay/,0.066,0.771,0.162,0.9956

169,CMC," I bought into CMC, Cielo Waste Solutions, and Im surprised its up by 12% today. Nice surprise.

This company has an exclusive global license from a related party to a technology for refining household, commercial (includes municipal waste) and construction/demolition waste into high-grade renewable fuels/diesel. The technology is also effective on wet organics (compost), all plastics, paper, tires, cardboard, sawdust and wood. Cielo plans to construct renewable diesel refineries globally using alternate waste feedstocks.

Cielo already has their 100% owned first refinery operating in Aldersyde Canada. As of July 2021, the Aldersyde plant is currently running at 5,000 liters per day, on process to ramp up to the designed capacity to produce 24,000 liters per day of diesel fuel. 

A very nice business given that regular diesel prices globally are averaging about C$1.73/liter, boosted by the recent oil price surge.

During all of this the heavy short interest may need to close their position as margin requirements will grow quickly. If shorts start closing this will add more buy-side pressure.

The original post was merely to begin discussion; which thankfully it has.

I'm going to stand by my conviction that a company ($BEST inc), which is generating $5+ billion USD in 2021 should be at $21+ a share with a 1xP/S; radical I know, but I do believe their fundamentals warrant a much higher share price.
