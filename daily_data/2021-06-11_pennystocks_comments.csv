1,ALL," Didn't have time to read the other responses so apologies if I am repeating...

The point is to limit investments in PENNY/ INDIVIDUAL stocks to only what you can lose.  Investing in a penny stock is like investing in your friend's idea of starting a bar.  The chances are low it will be successful and a chance of total loss.  That is why you only put what you don't need to pay the bills for food or shelter.  You wouldn't your rent money for next month tied into if your buddy's bar is still around next month.

Now what you are confusing is it is GOOD idea to invest as MUCH as you can in investments that have less risk of total loss.  How do you decrease risk of loss in stocks?  Well using the example above what if you could invest in ALL the bars in your city?  The chances of all the bars going to zero is about zero.  The return you get for doing this would be the average of ALL the bars revenue each month based on how much of each bar you own (market cap weighted).  You don't get a chance to hit it big as if you would have if you put it all in your buddy's bar which may end up being the top revenue maker, but you eliminate the chances of investing it all in the bar that closes its doors as it is not profitable.  This analogy is why any intelligent financial expert will advice index funds for majority of your investments.  If you know statistics by index investing you ultimately cut off the right and left tails of possible returns and get more of the average.

So a reasonable split would be 90-95% index funds and 5-10% single company bets.  So YES you want to invest as much as you can in stocks (gives the best chance at high returns), but not take on too much single company risk (risk of losing all your money betting on one hand).

Hope that makes sense.",10xwannabe,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/nxbc2v/only_invest_what_you_can_afford_to_hold/h1g870a/,0.064,0.824,0.112,0.9586

As for Rolls Royce, be sure to do your DD. I sold mine a bit ago, because I just don't see any kind of real growth coming anytime soon.

In addition to this, today was not the last day to buy in for dividend or merger benefits in general. The ex dividend date has yet to be announced so you can still buy TRCH shares for the dividend.
