1,SNDL," Not much usually but I got three bucks for the last contracts but within thirty minutes the bids jumped to four. I made the most when the value spike several weeks back, sold the calls totally expecting to get assigned and get out of SNDL altogether but the value dropped before expiration so it worked out just right lol",OriginalG33Z3R,5,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/n5darx/sundial_becomes_a_stronger_and_more_diverse/gx1e72x/,0.0,0.835,0.165,0.8931
2,RH," You can sell options on RH but they will not track your cost basis to reflect premiums, positive or negative.  I am not aware of any platform that does (but I've only ever used RH and Schwab so my experience is limited).  I track my cost basis on a spreadsheet.  Also, this is not cost basis for tax purposes to the best of my knowledge, only to track my own profit/loss for each stock I sell options on.",Chaosmusic,5,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/n5darx/sundial_becomes_a_stronger_and_more_diverse/gx1ioua/,0.058,0.818,0.123,0.7684

13,ZOM," I set a limit order to buy ZOM at .80. It triggered in late April. I set a stop loss after my limit order filled. A week later, boom, 40% gain before I got stopped out. It's ridiculous.
