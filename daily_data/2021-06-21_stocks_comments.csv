1,IBM," I forgot what the class was called, but it was business related and we entered a Long Island stock competition put on by Newsday.  We came in 3rd amongst hundreds of teams thanks to awesome stock tips from my Dad...this was early 90's and we were pouring our fake money into Microsoft, Adobe, IBM, and other tech stocks....while most other kids were buying Nike and Coke.  The two teams that beat us had returns several multiples above ours.  My teacher was convinced they were backdating their trades.  :-)  But whatever, it was a ton of fun and planted the seed for later in life.  That teacher wrote in my yearbook he expects a share of the first million I make in the market...I actually want to make good on that.",Gorpachev,35,/r/stocks/comments/o4n02o/why_dont_high_schools_have_classes_on_stock_market/h2iatgt/,0.028,0.78,0.192,0.9761

It wasn‚Äôt very in depth, but it was more helpful than a lot of the other shit I had to study while I was there. I do think that all schools should have some form of this in their curriculums because a lot of people end up learning basic money principles way too late and have either already missed a lot of time in the markets or are in financial trouble due to debt or poor understanding of credit scores.

When you're an adult it's a very harsh process to learn like a child.  You have to be willing to act like a total moron for a while.

FB immediately began falling post-IPO, and went south of $15 within a few weeks.

86,IP," For my job I listen to a lot of earnings calls. I suggest you do this for any stock you want to invest in

Canoo had the worst one I ever heard. 

First off, if you‚Äôre going to have a major change in the management of the company, the absolute worst place to do it is in the earnings call. If you‚Äôre going to throw your strategy in the trash can, the earnings call is also the worst place to do it. 

Feast your eyes and decide if this is the person/company you trust your money with:

""Today, we announced that Renato Giger, who I have worked with and known for many years, joined us as our Interim CFO.""

New CFO announced on the earnings call? WTF.

Craig Irwin (Analyst):
Okay. The second question there ‚Äì there's a little bit of a contradiction in your prepared remarks. So Tony, you talked about how engineering IP broadens your TAM, but then you announced that you're deemphasizing your engineering services. Can you help us resolve that and maybe give us a little bit more color about why you would deemphasize engineering, given that the original story was ‚Äì it would subsidize the development and broaden the partner opportunity with potentially multiple hats on their license.

Tony Aquila (Executive Chairman):
Yes. So look, I would say that from the comments perspective it was a contradiction, it hasn't been a contradiction from my statement. Look, as I said in the new marks we looked into this, it kind of goes to your first question too with the talent war and everything just the $25 million, it would yield us. We at the board really feel like the best thing to do is to accelerate our derivatives and focus our talent on creating IP for the company. You also have a lot of IP leakage when you do this work. And from my perspective, if I had been more involved earlier certainly, I certainly once I started ‚Äì I invested and then I took the chairmanship, we started the analysis. I had concerns about this. If you study all OEMs, you can find a partnership or something like that if it makes sense. And we'll continue to look for things, but to be a contract engineering house is just really not going to drive the best shareholder value.

WTF!!!!!

Craig Irwin
Okay. And then, this is a tough question, but all the institutions are going to ask this question tomorrow, right? So first Alex Marcinkowski is gone now Paul Balciunas. These are the two gentlemen that sold the pipe. A lot of people met with them and Ulrich for your de-SPAC process. That's a fairly heavy turnover and we didn't have Ulrich on the call today, which appears like I'm missing. Can you maybe talk about the high turnover and what's going on here; and is Ulrich still Chief Executive Officer?

Tony Aquila
Yes. So look as we've kind of been navigating through going public. We're obviously bringing in people with extreme public company experience. We're making the call today from Dallas, Texas; not in California, due to the California still in a bit of a lockdown, and Texas being wide open. So yes Ulrich is still currently the CEO of the company, and as far as with respect to your comment about turnover, its true there's been some turnover in these positions, but we've been bringing in people that one and they have worked together as I mentioned in my comments, and this will stabilize. I think a lot of SPACs and a lot of companies as they go through this migration will be bringing in people with experience in the public markets. So, I just think we're a bit ahead of it and we'll stay ahead of it, and as we navigate this step-by-step quarter-by-quarter.

Craig Irwin
Last question, if I may. You're obviously deemphasizing engineering and engineering services. So that seems to imply that the original SPAC model is no longer guidance going forward. Is that accurate?

Tony Aquila
We'll be giving ‚Äì we're not going to give ‚Äì at this point that doesn't make sense to give guidance until we complete the work that we have started. And with all that's gone on in the SPAC world, in the pre-revenue side, we want to be very conservative. If you look back at the history of the team that is now more and more coming into play, they've been ‚Äì they never missed consensus. And so doing this at a high public company standard, I think is important for all SPACs, and certainly we're going to do our best to lead the way here. And so we will be step-by-step building this and we will be delivering information as it is. It is known and contracted, not based on light rev ‚Äì reservation models. I think that's dangerous. I think it could be somewhat misleading.

And so typical of any leadership change at different standard comes in and will guide you through that. Kamal, we'll be following up with you on a regular basis. Certainly do acknowledge your point; Craig that you got so to speak, as you mentioned showed a different model, but this model is better from a return on capital basis. And I think as you work through it, you'll like it, especially the areas and the margins of the areas we plan to operate under. So let's kind of table that and discuss through it.

Craig Irwin
So I will acknowledge that these are significant surprises on the call today, and that's not ideal after a SPAC IPO process. So, I just wanted to underline that? Thank you.

Tony Aquila
Totally understand your understand your perspective; obviously I wasn't here when they did the original model, but certainly wanted to get ahead of this and explain to you how this really is going to work and how to build a profitable company, which we've done in the past. And we intend to do here, but hey, we understand the situation it puts you in and we work closely to rectify that. So you can understand very clearly where we're going.

107,NAV," So the price per share of an ETF can represent different number of shares of the underlying stocks in the ETF but they should all represent the same ratio of the underlying companies to get the same performance.  Some may want to buy a cheaper ETF per share but the most important factor are the expense ratios and the fact that one ETF is more expensive than another per share really doesn't matter much as you just own a different number of shares of each.

The actual value of an ETF is represented by the NAV and the NAV will go up and down with the value of the underlying securities even if the price of the ETF is not changing because no one is trading it.  If the price of an ETF gets too far out of sync with the NAV then authorized participants can create or destroy shares of the ETF, They will buy shares of the underlying companies to create new shares of the ETF that they can sell at a profit if the price is too high or they can buy shares of the ETF and eliminate them and then sell the shares of the underlying companies for a profit if the price of the ETF is too low.  This keeps the price of the ETF in line with the NAV no matter the inflows or outflows of the ETF.  Obviously the price will still stray a little from the NAV but never too far.",imnotgood42,19,/r/stocks/comments/o51e6a/question_about_etfs/h2kbx5b/,0.037,0.758,0.206,0.9915
108,NAV," Only looking at the prices of ETFs that track the same index is essentially meaningless for most purposes, because like you said they track the same thing, which means returns should be equal if they track the same index using the same methods. You shouldn't be thinking of these price differences as if they are worth or cost more/less, think of it more along the lines of the minimum required to invest in a fund because thats all it is. If you only have $60 then you cant invest in the funds that have a minimum higher than that to invest, but if you have $100k then you can use other factors to decide which to invest in.

The price of an ETF is determined mostly by its Net Assets and its number of outstanding shares. Net Assets divided by outstanding shares = NAV, the NAV of a ETF should closely follow the price of the ETF, share price deviations from the NAV are referred to as Premium/discounts. 

The number of shares is also somewhat arbitrary, one ETF could for a simple example have 100 shares, lets call it ETF1, and another ETF, ETF2, could have 10 shares, now if they track the same index, had the same Net assets, and everything else equal, and net assets=X then ETF1 would be worth x/100 per share and ETF2 would be worth x/10 per share. So if no premium/discount exists then ETF2 (x/10) would cost 10x more than ETF1 (x/100) but ETF2 is not really 'worth' more more, because you end up owning the same amount of underlying assets if you put the same amount of money in either. The only difference would be the minimum required to invest in each fund, or in other words the share price.

Now why would someone buy an ETF that shares cost 10x more than another ETF if they are essentially equal? Well there could be a few reasons, volume of shares actively traded/liquidity, the premium/discount could play a role, as well as expense ratio or maybe there are minor difference in the way they manage the fund or track the index, this is just to name a few. But at the end of the day if they are putting in $X amount of dollars it wont matter much which ETF they chose because they end up with the same % of assets per $ either way. Expense ratio and trading volume are what I look for most when deciding between ETFs personally. (Not financial advice)

For your final question, this goes back to NAV, if an ETF's NAV goes up and no one is buying well then the share price will stay the same and the NAV will just continue to go up until people realize the discount that exists on that ETF by comparing its share price to its NAV. The market will eventually correct itself so the share price and NAV are near equal.",ScionCopyCat,2,/r/stocks/comments/o51e6a/question_about_etfs/h2khmcq/,0.018,0.819,0.163,0.997
109,NAV," ETF's have the NAV (Net Asset value) value and they have the stock price value.

These are not always the same and that is called a ""discount"" or a ""premium"" to NAV.

One may sell on a red day because he thinks upward momentum is lost. And waiting for a Green Day, when you already plan to sell soon, may mean riding the damn thing all the way into the ground in the hope of a tiny extra gain.

Kinda like the mentality to Buy the Dip when a stock is down 1% after a 20% run up. Focusing way too much on the short term.

I don't love Pharma companies because I'm an idiot when it comes to medical science but I understand their Mino-Lok product has been fast tracked by FDA and all data that has been revealed so far has been positive. Currently, if a central venous catheter is infected, the standard is to remove and replace it. This has a high percentage of complication and sometimes leads to infections that cause death. Mino-Lok can clean the catheter and avoid this pretty common problem. Potential Global TAM of $1.8B. The product could be on the market in 2022. They have a decent amount of cash that should get them to market as long as things continue to go well with FDA. 

The President and CEO is Myron Holubiak who was the President of Roche which is one of the largest pharma companies in the world. The Chairman Leonard Mazur ran Cooper Laboratories which spun off a few successful companies including Cooper Dental which grew into Oral-B.

247,GM," My problem with GM and other traditional automakers are EV plays is this question: How will shifting their entire automaker lineup over to EVs help them bring in more profits in future years? I've yet to hear a convincing answer to this question.

People have Tesla's price up so high not because it's about EVs, but because they're delivering rapid growth year over year. They're expected to continue growing 30 to 40 percent year over year for a number of years as they continue building more gigafactories. I see little chance of established automakers like GM ever putting up those kinds of numbers no matter how successful their transition to EVs is.

GM's best hope for growth quite frankly is if a number of other automakers fail to make the transition to EVs and go bankrupt, allowing the survivors like GM to cannibalize their market share. But there's a problem with making this into your bullish thesis for why GM will grow a bunch from EVs. If a lot of other automakers can't transition to EV's then chances are GM will run into a lot of the same troubles that prevented those automakers from transitioning to EVs. So what's your explanation for how GM will overcome those problems and thrive while other automakers will fail to overcome those problems and collapse?

I think this is part of why GM is struggling right now in the EV market. Most of the people buying EVs today are still early adopters, and early adapters don't have a good opinion of the GM brand. Early adapters want all the latest tech and gadgets, which is why Tesla does so well with them, GM isn't exactly known for being first at bringing consumers the latest car tech.

When EV's become more mainstream I think GM will have an easier time selling them to the people who are typically interested in buying GM vehicles.",ShadowLiberal,1,/r/stocks/comments/o51hbh/gm_is_the_next_big_ev_opportunity_short_term_and/h2kgok8/,0.068,0.786,0.146,0.8234
258,GM, That doesn't answer the question though. Shifting to EVs for GM means spending billions to make LESS money on their cars in the next ten years.

259,GM," A ton of what you said is simply misguided and shows a lack of knowledge.Tesla produces EV batteries at a cheaper price than their competitors. That's why their cost will be lower than other EV makers while having equal or better performance. A large percentage of EV vehicles will be the cost of batteries. GM is expected to reduce the cost of battery cells to $75 per kilowatt hour by 2025 while Tesla is already targeting a $50 per kilowatt hour by the same timeframe.

You also need to convert your factories. ICE vehicles cannot be constructed using manufacturing designed for EV's and vice-versa. Tesla is fully EV so there is no conversion process that GM will undoubtedly have to face as a learning curve.

Tesla is expected to produce a $25,000 sedan by late 2022. My assumption is mid 2023 is a better estimate. NOTHING GM is expected to produce will beat that value.

You also completely ignore the beauty of a Tesla... their autopilot system is designed for the future. GM's Cruise is severely underwhelming and unlikely to be anywhere close to what Tesla has. Tesla's autonomous driving already logged 500 million self-driving miles during year 2018. GM only logged 447k miles. GM is way behind in terms of research and development.

Your regulatory credits is a terrible argument. Is it helping Tesla? Sure. But the fact that the regulatory credits continue climbing show that plenty of other auto companies are still lagging behind which means Tesla's lead continues to grow. Companies also plan their spending based on what they expect to receive. If regulatory credits didn't exist, Tesla would change other parts of their business. That regulatory revenue just means Tesla has more money to play with but it doesn't decide the fate of their business. It's just what novices like to point to when they try and discredit the sustainability of Tesla.

The government rebate, which I believe you are referring to as tax credits, already expired for Tesla years ago during July 2018... The individuals purchasing Tesla's right now are not receiving a federal tax credit. GM also doesn't have any federal tax credits as well. If this isn't what you mean by government rebate, please tell me which one you are specifically referring to.

My relatives own Teslas. The build quality could be better but Tesla is still relatively new at the mass manufacturing part of constructing vehicles. Could they be better? Definitely. But the build quality isn't 'trash.' And it will improve as they gain more experience. Constructing EV's isn't cheap. That's why GM is planning to spend $35 billion. There will be a learning curve for GM just like there was for Tesla.

As for the labor claims, many auto companies end up dealing with labor claims. GM has one right now in Mexico. Stop acting as if these labor claims are going to defunct Tesla's business. They will be handled accordingly and your assumption that they will have a 'hard time' shows that you haven't really paid attention to numerous labor claims that have happened for auto companies for many decades now. They aren't new concerns.

260,ICE," A ton of what you said is simply misguided and shows a lack of knowledge.Tesla produces EV batteries at a cheaper price than their competitors. That's why their cost will be lower than other EV makers while having equal or better performance. A large percentage of EV vehicles will be the cost of batteries. GM is expected to reduce the cost of battery cells to $75 per kilowatt hour by 2025 while Tesla is already targeting a $50 per kilowatt hour by the same timeframe.

You also need to convert your factories. ICE vehicles cannot be constructed using manufacturing designed for EV's and vice-versa. Tesla is fully EV so there is no conversion process that GM will undoubtedly have to face as a learning curve.

Tesla is expected to produce a $25,000 sedan by late 2022. My assumption is mid 2023 is a better estimate. NOTHING GM is expected to produce will beat that value.

You also completely ignore the beauty of a Tesla... their autopilot system is designed for the future. GM's Cruise is severely underwhelming and unlikely to be anywhere close to what Tesla has. Tesla's autonomous driving already logged 500 million self-driving miles during year 2018. GM only logged 447k miles. GM is way behind in terms of research and development.

Your regulatory credits is a terrible argument. Is it helping Tesla? Sure. But the fact that the regulatory credits continue climbing show that plenty of other auto companies are still lagging behind which means Tesla's lead continues to grow. Companies also plan their spending based on what they expect to receive. If regulatory credits didn't exist, Tesla would change other parts of their business. That regulatory revenue just means Tesla has more money to play with but it doesn't decide the fate of their business. It's just what novices like to point to when they try and discredit the sustainability of Tesla.

The government rebate, which I believe you are referring to as tax credits, already expired for Tesla years ago during July 2018... The individuals purchasing Tesla's right now are not receiving a federal tax credit. GM also doesn't have any federal tax credits as well. If this isn't what you mean by government rebate, please tell me which one you are specifically referring to.

My relatives own Teslas. The build quality could be better but Tesla is still relatively new at the mass manufacturing part of constructing vehicles. Could they be better? Definitely. But the build quality isn't 'trash.' And it will improve as they gain more experience. Constructing EV's isn't cheap. That's why GM is planning to spend $35 billion. There will be a learning curve for GM just like there was for Tesla.

As for the labor claims, many auto companies end up dealing with labor claims. GM has one right now in Mexico. Stop acting as if these labor claims are going to defunct Tesla's business. They will be handled accordingly and your assumption that they will have a 'hard time' shows that you haven't really paid attention to numerous labor claims that have happened for auto companies for many decades now. They aren't new concerns.

267,KGC," We got a small glimpse of how the market feels about gold as an inflation hedge. Personally, I can‚Äôt get on board with some of your bull cases.

>The P/E is 6.58, which is lower than most competitors.

For one, this isn‚Äôt a growth stock. PE should be low. Most people invest in miners as a hedge, to de-risk their portfolio. KGC is much more risky than competitors because their largest mine is located in Russia. That has likely detracted investors so they aren‚Äôt putting a premium on KGC over competitors.

>Plans to increase mining production by 20% from 2021 to 2022‚Ä¶ This could either offset a decrease in gold price

Disagree heavily. This is the same thing Oil & Gas E&P companies face all the time. They get in this vicious cycle of having to ramp up production to offset falling commodity pricing. Any new production capacity is met with new capital expenditure thus making that new production initially cost more than existing production. Lower prices makes this worse. That‚Äôs why in the Oil sector, rig counts fall as prices fall.

>‚Ä¶restart dividend payments in 2020

Little bit suspicious. There was a money flow to dividend stocks and the thought that if the Fed didn‚Äôt raise rates, this was where you park your money for low risk low return. Last week saw a lot of that money leave. 

>analysts

Are generally useless. Hasn‚Äôt been any upgrades/downgrades since Jan. And there were 14 buy recommendations in May that fell to 8 in June.

The biggest thing for me is that KGC has underperformed the S&P 500 for over 5 years consecutively with the exception of the gold spike in 2020. 

TL;DR Highest risk of all competitors. Has consistently underperformed S&P 500 for years. Gold spike will help the stock but you‚Äôre better off being directly exposed to gold instead.

268,KGC," Thank you for your response.

>For one, this isn‚Äôt a growth stock. PE should be low.

I agree. I don't see this as a growth stock - I see it as a value stock. By definition, the P/E will be low, and based on my analysis, I find that it is lower than what KGC's financials warrant.

>KGC is much more risky than competitors because their largest mine is located in Russia.

As of 2020, I don't think that this is the case. I believe that their largest mine by production is in Brazil. Regardless, the research that I've done shows little in the way of disruption in the Russian mine operations.

>Any new production capacity is met with new capital expenditure thus making that new production initially cost more than existing production.

Also, I agree with this sentiment. However, I find that the primary driver of increased production capacity for KGC will be increased production at existing mines.

2. Example bought GME, had a 80% return, was happy didn't sell because of the possible Squeeze. Could nearly doubled my money. (Before someone complain about selling GME Shares - Screw You)
Same with some other stocks, i decided for example Tesla is a long term play, but it still will be swinging around.
On small caps stocks, i will not risk my position for a quick dollar, they could easily take off, when the reasons are there.

Next time i hope will act different, take your money, wait for the dip, buy.",iyo97,2,/r/stocks/comments/o4x706/when_to_take_profits/h2jv1mk/,0.031,0.827,0.142,0.9379
293,CHEK," Is it ctxr? Nvm: saw another comment. 

What I can say though is that im currently up 190 percent on CTXR which kinda puts me in the same boat as you. I think there are multiple things you can do and all have justifiable reasons.

First one is just cash out and take the profit. Let's be honest a big percentage profit is unreal. If it's enough to screenshot then it's probably time to cash out. However, I did this with my CHEK shares at a ~65 percent profit after buying in at 1.01 beginning of march. 2 weeks later FDA approval for a study came and it went as high as 4.50 intraday. Needless to say I was bummed out.

Second option: sell half the shares or a different portion and let the rest ride. This is probably the only option that let's you nibble the cake and have it too. Obviously you limit your upside but also your downside and profits are profits. 

Last option: don't sell. I'm honestly just going to ride my CTXR shares out since I am going to be long on this company anyway. I'm also waiting on some FDA related news and will definitely sell if there is a spike and buy back later may it drop to lower levels. 

Either way the choice is yours. All depends on risk-tolerance, level of conviction and let's be honest making the right decision also involves a bit of luck sometimes.

Either way gratz on the (potential) gains.",alttoby,1,/r/stocks/comments/o4x706/when_to_take_profits/h2kb9cg/,0.041,0.804,0.156,0.9829

342,COIN," Cool, I personally invest with the same mindset!
So I will switch gears a bit and explain my thoughts on coinbase + the questions I used to make my decisions, rather than tell you what you should do. 

I think it‚Äôs important to remember that (based on their business model) $coin has a revenue case when crypto is crashing as well as rising-

Because they profit per transaction, not per profitable trade so panic selling can actually work in their favor, generative short term revenue. 
Plus the same emotional investors who panic sell are likely to fomo back in during a bull run, so they aren‚Äôt going to loose much in long term customer base. 

Additionally, long term investors who are interested in (for example) buying Ethereum and then staking it, and might view this as a time to do that on discount;
Given that COIN profits from long term Hodlers doubling down and from traders cashing out, Coinbase is within my personal tolerance as a mid to long term play. 

This will be COIN‚Äôs first earning report during a prolonged period of negative price movements, so investors haven‚Äôt necessarily seen proof that negative price action in cryptos can be profitable for them. 
I personally think that this isn‚Äôt priced in, and that the price going down reflects people thinking of investing in COIN as a way to invest indirectly in cryptocurrency as whole. 

What is your personal risk tolerance for this?
How in the red are you willing to be, and for how long?
Do you think there is a value you see that isn‚Äôt reflected in the current price? 
How confident in that value proposition are you?

Then it‚Äôs just a personal balancing act between your risk tolerance and confidence levels.

I think many value investors agree that the most important value is free cashflow.

As a value investor you want to invest in profitable companies with a moat.

A moat is a **lasting** competitive advantage. This can be a brand, a patent or even cheap production costs.

Ok then you want to look at P/E ratios. You want a low P/E, cause then your starting yield is better.

Then you want a high ROE.

Warren Buffett for example says that the company should have a P/E of 10 or lower, but he's an OG so it doesn't necessarily mean that he's right or wrong.

I think it's crucial to invest in solid companies as a value investor!!!

You want to be in a solid industry that doesn't get disrupted.
