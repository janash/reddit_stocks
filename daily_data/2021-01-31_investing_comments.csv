2,GME," If you're curious to understand what this looks like in real time, take a look at the GME this Thursday 1/28/2021 when it went artificially from \~$390/share to a low of around \~$125 in \~50 minutes despite a ridiculously low volume of shares being traded. It's a play called a ""short ladder"" (I'm new to all of this but hell if I'm not learning a ton these last few weeks!)I'm still baffled at how disgusting these moves are... and I'd wager it's far from over.

Edit to add what short ladder attack is:

Say price of XYZ stock is $400/share.

Hedge A sells shares of XYZ stock to Hedge B for $390. Hedge B sells shares of XYZ stock back to Hedge A for $380. They ping pong back and forth on an extremely rapid pace, making it appear that the new price per share is far lower than the market value previously was. This spooks the hell out of people who are worried about losing their entire investment and they sell (probably at a loss), Hedges scoop up shares they've shaken out and the price rises back to it's regular level when they're done.",DystopiaInbound,331,/r/investing/comments/l92fz7/jim_cramer_gave_an_interview_in_2006_on_how_the/glg3q91/,0.159,0.734,0.107,-0.9557
3,TV," Some background on Jim.  This interview was actually supposed to be redeeming him.  In some ways it brought things to light, but in others it just shows how shady he is too.

Jim recommended buying tech stocks at the height of the dot com bubble in 2000 famously saying PE ratios are irrelevant.  He also had stocks he recommended at that time, all of which declined precipitously.

He recommended buying banks in 2008, including Bear Sterns.  We all know how that worked out.

I read once, not sure how true, that if you bet against Jim using puts and calls you would have beat the market consistently.

Jim is a talking head.  Hes like that guy who everyone wants to talk to at the dinner party because he is entertaining but you know that his heart is black as coal and he is a shell of a person.

I like Jim for his entertainment value.  But he toes the line on TV, and you more or less shouldnt listen to him.

* Another major problem with TV news is entertainment.  We want to be entertained.  Stewart is an example of where this works well, but he is just providing the criticism and not the education/solution side.  The education part is REALLY hard to sell unless you do the Cramer thing.    

* The real world is always more complex than what fits in a tweet.  The details of how settlement and so on get really boring really fast, and that is how this nonsense thrives.

24,SO," Is there anyone today that's dependable for financial investigative journalism? (Legit question)

ALWAYS think about where a company makes their money.

CNBC makes money from being entertaining, NOT giving sound financial advice. They could care less whether what they're saying makes any sense, as long as you're watching.

Near as I can tell, we still to this day do not have consistent and quality financial journalism. Hedge funds are the ones making actual money off legitimately knowing what's going on, and they make SO MUCH MORE than anything else they could do, there's an extreme disincentive to sharing that knowledge or knocking their own house down.

r/wallstreetbets, for better or worse, is essentially a crowdsourced hedge fund. The only issue is the peasants figured out how to play the game.

In that case taking profits isn't your goal, and you're willing to lose all the money on principle, and leaving the stock long puts a LOT more pressure on the financial system to come up with a longer-term solution.

I think it is unlikely that the price of GME goes much higher than it does right now.  Oh, I understand the rules and how it SHOULD go higher, but it won't.  If they were following the rules the short interest wouldn't be over 100% in the first place.  In order to cash everybody out at $1k+/share you need hundreds of billions of dollars.  The hedge funds and their brokers don't have that, so they can't pay it.  The only way that can happen is if somebody else, like the US Treasury, comes up with the money.  

I could see there being a bailout here, but as with most bailouts there are going to be haircuts.  Maybe the hedge funds are forced to go bankrupt.  Maybe the redditors all get $100/share or something.  Congress isn't going to hand everybody $10k+ per share just because that is what the hedge fund should have owed them.  I wouldn't be surprised if people just got their original purchase price refunded.

The system really needs a lot more constraints on margin so that these problems don't happen in the first place.  This was a $100M company when this all blew up and look how much it will cost to fix if you want people who bought in late to at least break even.  You can't let the brokers make billions when things go well and then make the taxpayers pay hundreds of billions when things blow up.  You can't make the brokers pay hundreds of billions either since they don't have it - they're playing games with other's people's money and the only solution to that is just not allow it.",rich000,3,/r/investing/comments/l92fz7/jim_cramer_gave_an_interview_in_2006_on_how_the/glib1sd/,0.073,0.83,0.097,0.7553

&#x200B;

It’s great to get insight into the strategy for both sides and this helps prepare for the battle on Monday.  Couple of quick questions:

&#x200B;

\- Are there any good sources or ways to estimate the remaining GME float in the market?

\- Is retail support (i.e holding shares) \*\*truly\*\* important to the whales or is it just about creating the environment to get the squeeze to happen?

60,SO," Thank you SO much for this explanation. As someone who has only a very basic understanding of investing but keeps an eye on the market, this has been indescribably insightful. I've already started reading more about the many models and KPI's you've been mentioning throughout your posts. These have been inspiring me to learn more about investing (not just gambling).

Now to the question: I get the sense that you are mainly focused on providing hard facts and not advice, but FOMO is getting the better of me. Would you say that it's too late to get in on the action come next week? I would only put enough in to purchase a share or two at the current price - money that I am willing to lose (fully aware that it won't make me rich and it won't make me poor). If so, at what point would you recommend buying in (if it dips)? Is there usually a point during trading hours that this typically happens (early/mid/late in the day)?

I've also been seeing that $AMC is also part of this movement - what are your thoughts on that side of this?

Again, THANK YOU. These have been absolutely wonderful. I've been keeping up with WSB throughout this, so you're explanation is a breathe of fresh air.

64,GME," So I'm a complete newbie to investing. I bought into GME for 5k during the big attack on Thursday and ended up with a much better position than I should have had just on dumb beginner's luck accidentally nearly perfectly timing the ladder attack. I'd be disappointed if I were to lose everything, but ultimately it wouldn't affect my life in any way. I plan to hold it long and use this once in a lifetime event as a learning opportunity. If I break even, that's great. If I can show a profit, so much the better.

I recognize that this post is related to my question, but I'm not sophisticated enough to understand it well enough to supply my own answer.

I really like GME. I like it so much that I want more but I'm not willing to throw in any more cash because that would actually weaken my ability to hold it long term. I'd start caring about losing it.

I'm an idiot but I have a lot of free time these days and have been reading a lot. Too much really, I should be sleeping more. I'm in for the ride, but I also recognize there's a certain number of people who just wanna make a couple quick bucks, that will panic sell at the next attack, cash out and 'paper hand' it 'too early' and so on.

I have this idea of setting up like 2 shares at a sell stop (1k) limit (1.2k) with another 2 shares at a sell limit 1k, and a buy stop (1k) limit (600), with the idea being that if the HFs try to spike the price up to 1k causing people to cash out followed by an attack, I'd then grab up their stocks at a relative discount and increase my position overall without putting in any additional capital.

Of course I respect the fact that I'm a moron and I might be missing something obvious, as well as the fact that the HFs are smarter, more experienced, better equipped, faster and more ruthless than I could ever be. So would I be playing into their game in some obvious way? My only true ambition is to break even on this whole experience, but obviously I'd like to do better if I can. From what I've learned so far I'd probably be giving them something in terms of margins, options, whatever which I'm still yet to understand at all. But wouldn't buying up a couple shares that were being sold anyway at no additional cost to me be a net positive if my basic position is to sit and hold? I'm very much on the squeeze or bust train and kinda plan figure out the rest from there.

I'm sure I didn't format things correctly, so I'd appreciate any corrections and just overall relative risks and downsides to this idea considering my overall position.",Exzyle,13,/r/investing/comments/l97jbo/gamestop_big_picture_market_mechanics/glh8hw7/,0.103,0.696,0.202,0.9956

Crude & Vile is part of the sub and I loved it. But at the end we do watch for for each other, changed our views and most learned a thing or two however it was never a space where politics was a topic or driver of it’s momentum. 

However seems the events which took place last Thursday triggered an opportunity for political agendas to run ramped and morph a unlikely investment victory for the underdog into a totally different game, narrative,  sub reddit etc etc. 

It now feels very political, only leaving room for the anti and pro Wall Street.  That is not what I signed up for.

73,GME," Thank you for your excellent analysis.

I am curious about the collateral issue. How does dtc raising collateral obligations on GME purchase orders affect things, if at all?  Like, is there enough liquidity among the long positions to meet the collateral requirements necessary for continued purchasing  or could the collateral requirement act as an anchor holding the share price down lower than it would if the collateral requirement was lower?

Related: Does the 100% collateral obligations apply to HFs and other institutional players as well as retail investors? 

I have also been curious about the history of collateral increases. Some analysis suggests that the  collateral percentage is purely based on rote calculations. But is that the case? Are there examples in recent history of significant  collateral requirement increases like we saw on Thursday? 

And curious about whether those collateral increases were creeping up earlier last week as the volatility was increasing? Or if there was some triggering event that spiked the rote collateral requirement  calculation immediately from 2% (or wherever it started) to 100%?",Hill_Folk,2,/r/investing/comments/l97jbo/gamestop_big_picture_market_mechanics/glhv93r/,0.023,0.844,0.133,0.9569

89,GME," A fascinating deep dive as usual. The math and modeling behind your thoughts is always a good read!

That said. I've got some daily soapboxing:

>In a way, GME has turned into a battleground stock in the minds of many wall street people. Wall Street vs WSB is basically the way it's been depicted in the media, and a number of them seem to be taking it personally.

I want to emphasize care with the whole 'War with Wall Street Narrative'. The media has a vested interest in gathering eyeballs (like in politics), and the best way to do it is by inflating the importance of a war against wall street. It's a great story, but in the end, its still a 2.3B company inflated to a 23B+ company. If you think [brokers on askreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/l7bl3z/brokers_of_reddit_how_crazy_is_it_where_you_work/) are being remotely honest, this is just a few kids fighting over a kiddie pool.

To GME holders at large, I highly, *highly* suggest taking your shares at a high and walking away. If you lose, the person on the other end of your trade is most likely a whale or wall street institution. There's no glory in giving them your money.

90,GME," Thank you for the compliments.  No, no HF's are pressuring me.  I put my diagrams on an anonymizing file service because I want to avoid anyone ever knowing who I actually am to avoid that kind of BS.

The other post was not negative, or at least that was not my intention.  It was just not hype.  With that post and this post I was trying to show people some of the tools you can use to try to understand what is going on in the market.  You can get a good feel from the ticker action, and trade with better conviction and likely more consistent results if you do this.

My series of posts are intended to just walk people through how I look at things, and then also the importance of going back and verifying.  I know that no matter how certain I am of something happening in realtime, you never have the ability to actually check things carefully in realtime.  That is what I meant about occasionally going back and checking to see if you were correct.  In my opinion, I think it's better for me to show people the tools I sometimes use, ways I might use them, etc. and let them come to their own conclusions vs. trying to tell them what to do/think.  If I want to get psyched I'll go to WSB (seriously, some of those memes are awesome), so I figure I don't need to do any hyping here.  Realtime sentiment-driven momentum trading, on the other hand, means trying to be extremely sensitive to those things, which means trading that way with that kind of mindset, at least for me (hence the very different tone of those posts).

To me, it is important to try to understand players in the market, their sentiment, motives, morale, etc., so you can try to react appropriately, especially in a massively volatile momentum trade like GME.  On the other hand, when you have time, you want to step back and take a hard look at the data.  Over time you will find mistakes in your realtime reasoning, which will then help you learn to make more accurate calls in realtime going forward.

In that earlier post I referenced losing out on maybe $300k in momentum trading opportunity because I hadn't done a good analysis earlier.  Had I done one, I would have:
* Realized by the first after-hours tick of that first squeeze that in fact a squeeze was in progress, because I would have understood that that type of volume just does not happen normally after hours, even during the hype runup.  That would have put in context the $500 high as a squeeze high, not new retail support (i.e. sell there, buy the dip).
* Understood that the hard support to repel that insane short-side attack on Thursday would actually be in the 130s - 150s range (the momentum behind that move would definitely pierce what I labeled the line of defense in my last post, but then likely bounced back).  Just looking at the chart in realtime I figured that the support floor for the day was going to be around the market open bounce near 250s, so I bought into that dip way too early.  The 250s level was also on much lower volume to be a strong support.  Still profitable with the later mean reversion, but literally about 1/2 as profitable as it would have been had I been better prepared.

I would assume that they have more influence than retail, but that retail has a bit. But only if retail truly acts in a fairly consolidated fashion.

92,GME," There will be a point at which they get so far underwater that their broker issues them a recall and they either get some shares for the broker or the broker forcibly liquidates their account to buy back the shares at any price over a short period of time (at that point the broker is less concerned with how heavy the losses will be, and more concerned with getting themselves out of being exposed to the short interest liability ASAP).

The only question is at what price you can achieve that.  The two main things influencing that are: A) the size of the short position relative to the total account margin allowance, and B) the average share price of the short interest.

Based on the above, a few bullet points:

* Larger position size relative to the rest of the portfolio means the price doesn't have to go too far above their average price to trigger a squeeze

* Lower average price means the price to squeeze will be lower

* You can also try to attack the value of the rest of the account to instead lower their margin allowance if you cannot push the GME interest up (typically much harder, but there are exceptions).  This is also more feasible if it is a highly leveraged account.

GME has been an automatic two-way attack by both raising the price and resulting in deleveraging of the overall market, so the hedge funds are losing in both directions (GME going up, rest of portfolio going down)",jn_ku,128,/r/investing/comments/l97jbo/gamestop_big_picture_market_mechanics/glgt0ax/,0.072,0.88,0.048,-0.743

94,GME," I aint an expert, but from my experience last week there may be two issues:
- when you sell you may not be able to buy back in (depending on the broker you use)
- you’re essentially doubling down all the time. Which is cool and fits the spirit of holding more stock and that helps the cause. But it also increases your fear and greed gauge with every new share. Not a lot of people can handle seeing    10k (or a number they consider substantial) unrealized profit disappear in minutes and plunge into the red (have you ever asked yourself why trading platforms tend to display gains and losses very prominently in green and red?)

You must also understand that this is not investing. This is pure speculation. Investing is (should be) a net positive game (for the player A to win, player B does not have to lose). Speculation is a zero-sum game. And its worse than Vegas. In Vegas the house needs to tell you what your odds are.

My word of advice, this as someone with longs in GME: calm your nerves. Try to avoid letting WSB affect too much your mind now. I've personally been further empowered to watch out this by reading this sub and r/stocks. Plus there's still good commentary on WSB. It just requires digging and having a good internal filter. My take on the GME short squeeze hasn't changed.

I personally have posted on WSB that not all shorting is an issue. The issue is when it's going bonkers, like with GME, and when the shorting side doesn't understand to drop in time. It's an expensive lesson for them.

I'm pro equities, so I can't subscribe to the notion of a ""Occupy Wall Street, part 2.""

105,GME," It depends on your risk tolerance, opportunity cost, and investment goals. 

Literally no one— and I mean no one— knows what will happen tomorrow. You aren’t late to anything because we all arrive at the future at the same time, but Wall Street can make and execute decisions much faster. We are all just making educated guesses about that future. 

I’m guessing that you’re wanting to invest because you think the stock is going up sometime in the future. In your mind, when does that happen and, more importantly, why will that happen? If it does happen, when do you decide to sell? At what price? For you to buy the stock, the person selling it to you has a different set of assumptions and preferences that are telling them to sell. What do you think those are? 

The biggest mistake is to make a decision and then find evidence to back it up. Instead, look at the evidence, make a decision and then try to disprove that decision.

I will however be on the look-out for cheaper quality long term stocks that I would have bought anyway, but perhaps will now be able to get at discount. That’s where value for me is in this whole saga.

I also think that the best way to stick it to the man is to extract value that used to be theirs and transfer that value to someone else, i.e. me or you or anyone on mainstreet. That makes GME a sideplay for me, as wall street is very likely to play on both sides here (we just don’t know long side’s Melvins and Citadels), and they will also capitalize on the way down burning retail to the ground (provided that it doesn’t blow up). If it blows up, it will indeed put the whole market under pressure and prices will crash low. But I stand by my thesis, that nobody with influence wants to see this thing unravel uncontrollably (apart from WSB).

To maximize that value for the longest possible time I need to buy and hold as much GME as possible as long as I possibly can. So I treat my GME position as an entrance fee, or a levy, to keep the gates squeezed for as long as possible so that maximum value can be extracted.

132,GME," Something like this is possible, but not between the funds and the brokers.  The brokers have no way to hedge the risk they'd be taking on to do that favor, so they won't.  Basically, the hedge funds have nothing to offer them, and they're not a charity.  The hedge funds would have to instead cut deals with the large institutional holders of GME.

Normally you would say there was little chance of this, but if they wanted to go all-or-nothing into the trade, they would first lever into particularly sensitive parts of the large holders' portfolio, and then go negotiate.  The argument they would be able to make then is that allowing them to be blown up will cost the GME holder far more than bailing the hedge fund out.  This threat might have more credibility now than it did a week ago given that the entire market had to deleverage to an extent because of the GME situation--and it didn't even go full MOASS yet.

The intense focus on the exact SI number is partly why I focused on the mechanics in this post.  What that should help you understand is that as long as you get enough float locked up, whether SI is 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, or 120 is immaterial in terms of whether there will be a squeeze--there will be one.

As far as days to close, you have to look at the source's definition.  Ortex uses currently estimated SI / 30 day average daily volume.  I.e. their DTC calculation is garbage if the volume has been unusual/unusually volatile (which is the case with GME).  It's not that it's not normally a useful datapoint--it's just that this situation is so unusual that it's no longer meaningful.

Also keep in mind that the DTC figure is based on an assumption that essentially 100% of all buying on those days is done to close short positions.

Regarding 1 and 2, it is possible but would have a dramatic effect on the price.  If you think about it, so far GME has been largely momentum to the upside with occasionally strong short attacks down.

143,IMO," So looks like your momentum trading this and trying to time individual hedge fund squeezes and not a massive short squeeze all at once? 

This might be the best dd I’ve ever seen. I’m getting concerned with wsb, like a pyramid scheme. I truly do not think the shorts will be cornered and a name your price situation will happen. Wsb is saying 10-32k... like what. I think this is a misinformation campaign and retail will hold the bag...

Do you think Monday or Tuesday will be significant? I feel like gamma was already collected mid week. While there may be some residual at 320, I doubt it’s gonna be big. I think at this point it’s hedge funds vs other funds and retail is along for the ride?

At this point I feel like 2k is a ceiling, and the best way to collect would be staggered limit sells up. And trying to buy dips <200 for example... perhaps another ladder attack next week... though IMO for the whales they also want this to end soon (next week) as they are relying on retail too (media blame / float holding). Retail can’t hold on, during a pandemic.

145,GME," I pretty much agree with you. I've followed trading with level 2 data throughout the week and I saw how Thursday unfolded.

My take on the issue is, combined with the short ladder attack, that many retail investors, especially the ones using mobile apps like Robinhood and who just aren't sophisticated, went haywire as they couldn't buy more shares (among them GME). Of course that didn't affect everyone, inc. myself, but many either got scared by that or the cratering stock price. (Does Robinhood even require multiple clicks for orders?) Also the liquidation of assets with margin calls was a catalyst. Plus I'm not sure why Robinhood fractionals were being dumped. Panic selling?

Also broadly the sentiment got momentarily cautious, since it wasn't clear what's going on. I personally had a gut feeling somebody is seriously trying to jinx the retail investors and cause havoc. I personally decided to just watch how it unfolds.

If anything, there was a serious colluded attack on retail investors, which does warrant an investigation. I don't mean how they blocked purchases due to liquidity and clearing issues, since that's understandable. I mean that the timing of all the events and how also Reddit was being attacked. And the temporary shutdown of Discord was also dubious.

If anything, the retail side of the GME story held and in the end things rebounded, as the demand was still there.",StonksTycoon,1,/r/investing/comments/l97jbo/gamestop_big_picture_market_mechanics/glit6l8/,0.198,0.766,0.036,-0.9915

I’m kinda burned out on writing about GME, but just know that if this is allowed to play out how it should in a free market, the shorters do need retails holdings to close out. There is not a free market scenario where Blackrock, Fidelity, etc can magically drop their holdings instantly and retail is caught holding the bag without any chance to profit massively. If you’re holding just recognize how volatile this will get. In a free market it’d probably hit $1000 and upwards. You’ve just gotta be wary of how volatile the price swings will be and that you’re trying to profit in a small window. Your limit sells might not execute in time.

156,GME," In a trade like this, if you're careful, prepared, focused, and, let's face it, blessed with a bit of luck, you can :

* Buy and hold a core position to help the squeeze
* Momentum trade to generate more capital
* Allocate a percent of the momentum trading revenue between: further trading, accumulating a larger core position, profit taking

A really good momentum trader had 1 or 2 really good opportunities every day for the last week to make a significant return.  If you had started with, say, a 50/50 core holding and momentum trading allocation, by now you could have more than covered your initial capital outlay in profit taking, and 10x'd your position in both core GME holding and momentum trading capital.  These are normally ridiculous crazy talk-type numbers btw, but this is also probably a once-in-a-lifetime type momentum trading opportunity.  People who got in early and understood the opportunity have 100x'd with options before the option greeks blew up and they became so expensive.

That kind of strategy actually allows you to contribute more if your purpose is to trigger the squeeze vs if you just bought and held from day 1.

Regarding WSB, they are a mixed bag of people who really know what they're doing, and people who follow what those people tell them.  Whether that's wise just depends on whether you trust those peoples' A) judgement/skill, and B) intent.  I tend to believe that at least the OG GME people are both good and sincere, since they were sharing the opportunities and their reasoning transparently before anyone knew what would happen.  The only caution I have is that absolutely no one can tell you with certainty what is going to happen next.  Just remember that when you're riding the rocket... you're riding a F'in rocket... rocket rides are not smooth, but they can be awesome.

Regarding the pyramid scheme vibe.. I'm not sure one way or the other.  At the moment I tend to see more people who have latched on to the cause with such fervor and conviction (for various reasons), that they get mad if they feel like you're even hinting at any deviation from the gospel.  It is also true that at least to this point, if you lacked faith/conviction in this trade, you were almost certain to get washed out for big losses on the massive volatility.  That might be why some of them get so sensitive--they saw friends who got wiped out because at the critical moment they doubted and despaired out into the bottom of a hard dip.",jn_ku,101,/r/investing/comments/l97jbo/gamestop_big_picture_market_mechanics/glgx8ez/,0.061,0.773,0.166,0.9931
157,GME," The disincentive for them is that they might be able to get way more money just sitting tight than cutting a deal.

If GME legit turns around and becomes an important player in the gaming economy, the equivalent of a $1000/share target is realistically achievable. That’s in the neighborhood of $60bn market cap if I remember correctly. It might take years to accomplish, but Wall Street will give the share price the benefit of the doubt, so to speak, instantly if they believe that kind of turnaround is likely to happen, particularly in this monetary policy environment. Companies with way worse financials than GME are getting valuations way higher than that because they can get Wall Street to believe that someday somehow they’ll make insane money.

162,IMO," I agree with you FWIW. IMO there was a real possibility of an ""infinity squeeze"" but the retail buy restrictions on Thursday really let the air out of the tires at a critical moment - before that I was sure we were going to break $500 and beyond that day.

Realistically at this point all the remaining shorts probably came in at $200+ and can afford to wait a while without eating into their profits too badly. It would take some serious capital to drive the price up to the point of busting the current shorts. Maybe there's a whale out there with the will and capital to make it happen but I'm not holding my breath.

163,MS," >A really good momentum trader had 1 or 2 really good opportunities every day for the last week to make a significant return.

1) Do you think there will be similar opportunities in the coming week? I pretty much got lucky buying around $67 on a whim with a smaller amount of money and selling at $320 earlier in the week and sat on the sidelines for the rest of it (though I'm still holding some shares to support the cause and be a part of this grand meme). But part of me was thinking it might be some of the easiest money I could ever make if I just bought anytime it went below 250 and sold anytime it went above 350. Your 50/50 strategy sounds perfect, but I'm not sure if I have the experience or knowledge to actually pull it off, which leads me to my second question.

2) I'm not a good momentum trader or any kind of trader. I'm a retail investor with a basic understanding of the markets and investing principles (family financial planning and counseling MS degree and a investment and portfolio management specialization). But if for someone willing to read and put in some time and effort, how would they become a good momentum trader? Any recommendations on where to get started ? Is it a profitable endeavor for a retail investor on their own without a fancy HFT algo? Taking risk into consideration, could I actually get a better return than I would index investing without relying on luck? How much effort is needed to make that a reality in your opinion?

3) Thanks for your post. I've learned a lot about them.

178,GME," Great writeup. To be honest, it feels weird looking at the situation now. A few days ago I was so caught up in the whole thing, the mania of it that I barely ever questioned that things could play out differently. It's easy to forget that just because someone is on the other side they are not stupid and they may have a gameplan, other than hoping that people sell.

This whole GME thing went way off the rails when it transformed from people wanting to make money to some illusion of class warfare. People are acting like this isn't about making money but pulling some revolution through zero commission brokers. I'm also a bit sad about the hate some of those brokers got. I was mad as shit too, until I took a step back and after actually reading up on the thing realized that their hand was forced in most cases.

I'd also wager that half the ""diamond handed"" people got out the moment they realized this won't play out like volkswagen.",chairflunger,6,/r/investing/comments/l8yi83/common_misconceptions_about_markets/gli78t2/,0.138,0.725,0.137,-0.4978
179,RH," >Of course you were. Selling is exiting an already created position. The liability that RH would get if you were not able to sell and the price went down would be insane. They can not stop you from selling an asset that you own. They can, however, block the purchasing of new assets through their platform.

I don't think this is the full picture here. As I understand it, when a stock is sold from one broker to another, the DTC only requires collateral on the buying side of the trade. That is the side at risk because the buyer might have bought on margin or with funds that haven't fully settled in their brokerage account (like RH's instant deposit). There is no guarantee that the buyer actually has all the money to complete the trade until it clears 2 days later. 

On the sell side, however, you're sending stock to the DTC which doesn't have the same sort of questionable backing. They can accept that stock with a high level of confidence and debit the broker's clearing firm whatever the stock was to have sold for. So selling is pretty easy for a broker because they can debit you and get a reliable debit from DTC which clears the immediate credit risk for the broker. 

DTC is the one left holding the bag if the buyer fails to come through. [I'm not 100% sure about the next part, but I think it's right.] DTC will then keep the collateral payment as well as sell the orphaned stock at market price to recoup part of the loss and write off the rest (or they might make a profit if the stock rose in value during the clearing process). This is where another risk to DTC comes in - if the buyer defaults and the orphaned stock drops steeply in value during the settlement period (as $GME is very likely to do), then they have to rely on the collateral for most of their coverage. That's why they raised collateral for $GME.

Back to the original point, Robinhood didn't shut down selling because of liability risk - but because they simply didn't need to do that. DTC was only making buys difficult to complete.

183,GME," Thanks for the insightful post, here are my thoughts on the subject, though I'm very new to the investing world, I feel like there are a few things that you may be overlooking and things that I would like to clarify. Feel free to point out where I misunderstand.

1, 2 & 3 : RH f'ed up when they didn't plan ahead and realised they would/could have liquidity problem in the coming days. While I understand their reasoning, I still see a few problems with this situation, which you did not mention.

A. They did not plan their strategy or allocation of liquidity very well, when compared to other brokers.

B. They probably waited as long as they could before taking the decision to suspend buy orders, waiting to see if they had to take this extremely hard decision. IMO they probably set a limit on a metric (such as price or volume etc. Idk) so that if it reached it they activate the suspension. They could have done it at many points during the week, but waited to see if they could get away with it. I don't necessarily disagree with that choice, seeing as it wouldve been a disaster anyway. But the timing of this measure is definitely terrible, and they're intelligent enough to understand the implications of it. This is, in my opinion, not in the best interest of investors using RH, but I doubt that was ever their concern.

C. While I agree that Citadel isn't the main reason they did this, we shouldnt underestimate the potential influence their deal or collaboration had in this decision, and maybe they talked with each other. I understand citadel isnt just 1 person or 1 company, but please don't think wealthy people won't try to exercise their influence in any way they can to obtain the edge on their competitors, or simply limit the losses. I dont know how much % of RH's money come from PFOF, but I doubt that RH did not factor this in their decision.

D. RH did not want to say they had a liquidity problem, but the truth is, they did not YET. I think he was just playing with the words, but it is clear for everyone that he didnt want to risk having that problem, and he wouldve had a problem if he let people trade freely. So I think he was trying to say that he did not have a problem yet. Thats why he said he acted proactively (not sure what wouldve happened if he didnt have the money, like does RH shut down or trades get delayed or something?) Also, when he was saying : ""we were #1 on play store"", I think he just meant that he got a mssive influx of new traders, then their predictions were wrong and then they lacked liquidity, which I don't know how they couldve prevented it since they dont make money directly when they get new users. But it's not my job to think about that, thankfully. So yeah, thats my interpretation. 

In conclusion for 1, 2 & 3, I think RH f'ed up in two ways, and may or may not have been influenced by Citadel. If I were in the US, I would look for another broker, such as the ones you mentioned with their own clearing houses.

4. I believe Melvin did not lie when they said they closed their position. I think there are many possibilities here.
A. They closed, they announce it and try to spread the information to take heat off of them, to soothe their investors. They would probably take a huge hit if investors keep seeing melvin getting destroyed in headlines then remove their money from such a nonhedged hedge fund. After spreading this info, they short again, running the risk of SEC accusing them of misleading annoucements or soemthing (because it would be kinda sneaky to say you closed only to reopen a milisecond after).
B. Same as A but they pull out completely for a few days, cut their losses in GME and just go on something else. I think they have shown good returns overall. Huge hit, but they survive the public lynching.

I dont know which one I believe the most, but it doesn't really matter. Whether it's Melvin or other shorters, the % of short interest is way too high. And a lot of shorters are bleeding money.

As much as the stock price is high, the return on the shorters play depends on their thesis. Sure, if you think the stock is going down from 400 to 40, thats a huge profit, and Im sure many shorters will jump on that. However, It is hard to say that there is more money to be made. A hedge fund will be hedging according to risk, and right now the risk and uncertainty is surely hard to determine. There are a lot of factors in play and I am not going to be as arrogant as to say I understand all of it, but you are right when you say they come in more prepared, with strategies already in place. 

You may be interested in data of S3 partners who calculate (no clue how accurate) SI%. The data we get from official filings are usually out of date arent they. Anyway, even if its not as high as we all think, its still extremely high afaik. 

5. I agree with you that HF will probably never get margin called, unless you're Melvin or dumb. What I am curious about is how you seem to dismiss the %interest they have to pay(you mentioned 30%). Obvously they ""can"" pay that fee for years or infinitely, but that was never the point. Of course they ""can"" pay it, but does it make sense in their thesis, and how much money are they looking to gain from this trade? What is the best case scenario, worst case? Let's remember that they don't want to win for the sake of winning. They want profits, and tbey will make predictions. If they predict the stock to drop, lets say, 400 to 40 likes you say, then yes they can pay the 30% interest for years and still come out on top. But thats just one scenario. And when they make their model, they will compare that to other opportunities where they can spend their money, and if there are safer plays with better return out there, they will do it. Paying fees because you can is not a good reason, they have to make a prediction,  and make an exit strategy if things go wrong. In any case, high % interest will clearly reduce the time frame where a short trade is profitable, but clearly this time frame is also affected by the % return in the end. Highly doubt any of these trades are no brainers.

6. I doubt people let options expire worthless if this is what you are suggesting. I don't have much experience in interpreting options expiring, volume and how it affects the stock price, but I calculated a bit over 90k contracts calls expiring ITM and so about 9M shares will exchange hands. It may reduce the amount of shares that is currently being traded, or force some lent shares to come back (no clue what im talking about lol). Surely it has some effect, but I don't know in what direction it pushes the stock if it does, or if it limits the amount of shares that is being traded.

7. Sure why not, some are evil, some are bad, as in everything. I am having a hard time finding the reason of their existence, like... what is the point of winning the market. Whose money are they collecting, to what purpose and is it okay for this to happen? This, I don't want to spend too much time thinking about because it is depressing and will take us a long time to figure out. Is it increasing the gap between rich and poor, or is it dumb money, or is it rich peoples money or a combination of all of this. Doesn't matter. I don't like illegal stuff, I don't like people profiting from other people's failures but it is what it is. Maybe it is evil. 

8. Citadel the market maker indeed makes money when people are trading, so I would assume they want this war to last as long as possible. Also, citadel and citadel securities being 2 different entitites doesnt mean they dont collaborate, especially if it profits both. If no one goes bankrupt, citadel wins by letting ppl trade. If squeeze happens, then the frenzy dies and citadel stop making money. They have an incentive to keep it going (though, how much of an incentive is yet to be determined, it could be pennies or a big deal, I have no clue). That may or may not have been the reason behind them bailing Melvin out, but again, I suspect it may have been a factor.

Also, depending on how much of an increase of profits this war generates for em, it may be that spending a few millions here and there manipulating the markets to keep the ball rolling is, in fact, in their best interest (illegal however). That being said, citadel the market maker could be conaidered a Joker. On the other hand, other parts of citadel may have a side in this war, it wouldnt surprise me if the different entities under a same name bet against each other (like in the big short, morgan stanley i think). Anyway, I think market manipulation is quite common, the hundreds of thousands of bots and the string pulling we have seen in the past week is proof enough. The source of this market manipulation is however very hard to determine, but in the end it is just another another strategy with a cost. It wouldnt surprise me at all to hear some journalists got paid to take a side, but lets face it, Im sure you won't have to pay them to shit on people. Even if SEC sees that, they have decades of experience doing this on a small scale so Im sure they know what they can get away with. Would be nice to catch a few though! Short ladder attacks, I have no clue but I am planning to learn more about that. 

9.Yep.

TL;DR RH bad, Melvin dumb, Citadel making $ if war continues, shorts ""can"" hold forever but depends on their thesis.

They have an incentive to keep it going (though, how much of an incentive is yet to be determined, it could be pennies or a big deal, I have no clue). That may or may not have been the reason behind them bailing Melvin out, but again, I suspect it may have been a factor.

Also, depending on how much of an increase of profits this war generates for em, it may be that spending a few millions here and there manipulating the markets to keep the ball rolling is, in fact, in their best interest (illegal however). That being said, citadel the market maker could be conaidered a Joker. On the other hand, other parts of citadel may have a side in this war, it wouldnt surprise me if the different entities under a same name bet against each other (like in the big short, morgan stanley i think). Anyway, I think market manipulation is quite common, the hundreds of thousands of bots and the string pulling we have seen in the past week is proof enough. The source of this market manipulation is however very hard to determine, but in the end it is just another another strategy with a cost. It wouldnt surprise me at all to hear some journalists got paid to take a side, but lets face it, Im sure you won't have to pay them to shit on people. Even if SEC sees that, they have decades of experience doing this on a small scale so Im sure they know what they can get away with. Would be nice to catch a few though! Short ladder attacks, I have no clue but I am planning to learn more about that. 

9.Yep.

TL;DR RH bad, Melvin dumb, Citadel making $ if war continues, shorts ""can"" hold forever but depends on their thesis.

186,GME," Thanks for posting this. I've been trying to get people to question some of the wsb narrative that's being fed to them this past week with some limited success, so posts like these are helpful to show that there is dissenting opinion on this whole GME trade.

A few suggestions:

Expand on point #4 a bit more. This is the crux of the thesis for the GME trade and people should know that the 120% short number is not settled. I think linking to the NYSE short % release calendar ([https://www.nyse.com/market-data/reference/nyse-group-short-interest](https://www.nyse.com/market-data/reference/nyse-group-short-interest)) so that people can see when short % is actually updated would be helpful. It's also worth noting that an assumption with the thesis is that Melvin and the other HFs have naked shorts in GME, and this may not be the case.

Reword the RH section to talk about disallowing opening of new positions in GME and other meme stocks rather than not allowing buying while still allowing selling, which is technically not true (e.g., I could buy GME if I had an already open short position to close it). While 99% of RH traders would be trying to open long positions in GME, it's worth noting this as framing it as allowing for selling but not buying makes it seem like an nefarious attempt to drive the price down.

This may be beyond the scope of this post, but add in info about gamma squeezes -- I think it's important to not gloss over this point as I think it is being a driver of the price movement now.",makken,2,/r/investing/comments/l8yi83/common_misconceptions_about_markets/glgpxa1/,0.012,0.906,0.082,0.9252

But your thing on options, of course gamma squeeze didnt happen Friday cuz the expiration date is Friday. I dont believe this is fight between retail and institutions (inst. for short) anymore, its now between long inst. and short inst. 

And therefore most of the options are, like they usually are, owned by inst. The fact that Thursdays short attack stopped at 120 dollars (for 115c) and Fridays battle lingered on 320-330 support this (highest call for 29th was 320c) supports that long inst are holding good volumes of call options. Especially since 120 million dollars was used to drive the stock up in last five minutes on Friday (impossible for retail investors). 

Of course long inst wouldnt exercise call options Friday because it would be in their interest to make sure which options are itm and drive the price up by exercising lower priced calls first during an open market.

I dont know if any squeeze, gamma or short, will ever happen but I dont see how keeping the 320 line Friday was anything but a win for retail + long inst.

198,ABC," Great post, but you should update #6: 

Assigned/exercised options move stock between people/institutions. However, this movement does not affect the current stock price. (UNLESS someone sold uncovered calls).

The volume of calls or puts being assigned does not matter. 

Example: stock ABC closes at $11 on expiration. Investor A owns a $10 call, and it is exercised. The seller of the call (investor B)  already owns the shares (or owns another call at different strike). The following transaction occurs: Investor A gives B $1000, Investor B gives A 100 shares of stock ABC. 

IIRC, no volume is reported for ABC, neither a buy nor a sell occurred, and ACB price does not change.

IF they were uncovered calls (not really allowed, its significantly more risk than naked shorts), then Investor B would need to by 100 shares of ABC at current price, prior to the call being exercised.

200,HAS," Mostly accurate but you neglected important information about what really happened:

1) Robinhood only allowed selling for a short window, then they shut that down as well because as you say “cash flow”

2) Robin Hood closed people position both on request and without request at far less than their value. In my case $-75 per share. In some case people lost tens of thousands of dollars they would otherwise have if the just held for a few hours.

3) people are finding that their cash deposits are not showing up in their accounts, accounts show lower balances and transfers to banks are delayed. Call it high volume if you want but they need a notification.

4) Robinhood in some cases are not printing receipts needed to take to your stock broker and make a sell before lunch.

It may be understood that Robinhood has a cash flow problem, but they cannot let money flow in but not out without any notification. Closing peoples position at far under market value is shady as hell.

5) you say it takes 48hours for the clearinghouse to process the shares. BUT ROBINHOOD ALREADY HAS OUR MONEY IN THEIR POCKET BEFORE I HIT BUY!

I understand not allowing purchases on Margin as that affects their cash flow, but if I’m buying cash how does that affect them if they are putting up money for a sale.

6) CHARGE A FEE for volatile stocks to pay for the difference in time for clearing house to process. Then the user can make the decision if its worth it to them. $5 a trade is not uncommon in the industry.

As for the rest of it, the reason the brokers care about the funds blowing up is because it is the brokers share loaning programs that allow the short float to exceed 100.

Without share loaning, a short share has two owners: the short who borrowed it and the long that purchased it.

When the long is at a broker with share loaning, it can be loaned and either shorted again or gain another long owner.

It may not be naked shorting, but it effectively is and is wildly unethical and debatably illegal.

Float short interest is as low at 110 percent and as high at 128 percent from my research... The ladder attacked failed last week so how does the price stay down now?

Not really. For every short there has to be a long lending out the shares. The sum of all long positions minus all short positions is always 100% of stock. For GME with (reported) short being 140% there are 240% long positions.

If you restrict shorts to 100% only then you would restrict the rights to lend stocks for anyone else. EG. You borrow stock and sell it to me (short). Now I own the stock but am prevented to lend it out so someone else can short it, making stocks being sold out of a short essential worth less than normal stocks. That would basically create a two tiered stocks system, stocks that can be lend out and stocks that can't. How would you even attempt to price that?

301,MC," I'm still not convinced.

I agree that many of the new shorts who have just entered the position, would definitely have the funds, and done the calculations that they stand to profit once the prices go back down in the long term. However as it stands, if MC and the initial shorts that shorted the stock at 5 dollars, have not exited their position, the short squeeze will definitely trigger at one point. And if this was to happen, the new shorts that entered the position will definitely get margined called should the squeeze occur, if the price were to go to 100,5000,10000.

Will the new hedge funds entering this position be willing to take the risk to purchase naked shorts against GME? If I wanted to profit off the stock price going down, i would just buy longer term puts against the stock, betting that the price will go down after the whole saga blows over. That's why I disagree with your 5th point on hedge funds just riding it out after shorting the stock. Sure they can pay the interest, but how sure are they that the short squeeze will or will not happen, and are they willing to run the risk of being margin called if the squeeze actually happens. I don't think most hedge funds are stupid enough to do something as risky as that.

I think the question right now would be if the initial shorts have covered, which I really doubt, as the losses that MC would have racked up would definitely necessitate their investors bring lawsuits against them, and also a whole lot of people who invested their money being mad against MC, which we have not seen.

If we talk about vested interest, if Citadel injected 2.75 billion into MC, and MC used this money to continue shorting the stock rather than cover, we wouldn't have seen what went down on Thursday, where DTC raised the margin requirements and where algorithms are trading back and forth to artificially lower the price of the share. This leads me to believe that

1. DTC is preparing for a worse case scenario in the event of the short squeeze.
2. The initial shorts have not exited their position, and rather engage in manipulation to artificially bring the price down before they exit. They missed their exit back at 90, and now they are willing to play dirty and do whatever it takes to bring the price down for them to get out. Why would hedge funds with everything to lose, bother with just sucking it up and taking a loss, do you think they are able to accept losses so easily?

Besides, if the short interest from march was about 68 million shares and while it did decrease in the months following, to a low of about 56 million shares shorted in May, if we assume that MC took profits and only accounts for just half of the shares shorted. They would need to cover about 28 million shares best care scenario, and if they did cover as they said at the price of 90 dollars, they would have lost 28 million \* (90 - 5) = 2.38 Billion. This does not even include options or other forms of leverage which they might have employed. MC reports they have 12.5 billion dollars under management as of Jan 2021. They have the funds to cover.

If so, why would there still be a need for Citadel to inject them with funds, unless it was to either prevent them from being margin called as they have not covered or to allow them to dig deeper into their position. These hedge fund managers are not stupid, and I like to think of them as obnoxiously greedy, if not why did they short the stock to over 140 percent in the first place. Do you really think they are people who will honestly take their losses and move on? These are people who are used to manipulating mainstream media, buying themselves out of lawsuits, playing dirty. If anything I believe they will simply continue to dig deeper. Nothing is off the table until there is clear evidence which shows that the shorts have covered, or when short interest drops below 30 percent.

Nevertheless, your bearish outlook on the issue does make me clearheaded and reconsider what is going on at this point, but I still stand by my case.",fkitagn,2,/r/investing/comments/l8yi83/common_misconceptions_about_markets/glg6jmt/,0.11,0.786,0.104,-0.7218

308,MC," The price going up by 100x was over a period of close to a year, a short squeeze would see an exponential increase over the period of a day or even a couple of hours. 

Also, the short interest remains high which still makes me think that the squeeze has not occurred, as the shorts are merely digging in and going deeper into their short position, as long as the price keeps going higher, and people keep buying in, whether because of MC being margin called, or another hedge fund being forced to liquidate and close their position, the short squeeze will still occur as a result of the high short interest. 

The stock is still shorted over a 110%, and the pressure will keep ramping up as people continue to buy and hold the stock. I agree with you that the hedge funds can ride it out until the interest dies, but they are running the risk of the price increasing even further, that's why you see so much manipulation going on. They don't want the price to go up any more so they are willing to do anything to achieve that. I repeat, anything. There may be parties with a huge short position that want to close their position. But they aren't able to as people aren't willing to sell, so how do they close their position? Easy, controversy, manipulate the market, they still stand to gain as long as the price goes down. The other side of the stock does not have to be MC, as long as the short interest remains over 100%, they stand to lose so much more. This is not the first time that they have used mainstream media to manipulate the market with fake news so as to bring the price of a stock down. They still want to profit! Those on the short side.

To summarise: It does not matter whether the short squeeze has already occurred or not, or whether it is MC or another party, as long as there are people on the short side, as long as the stock price keeps rising, and people holding the stock not being willing to sell, the price will be dictated by the people selling to the people who want to close their short position. There will be a/another squeeze as long as the short interest is still over 100%.

Regarding Citadel investing cash into MC, I have no way to disprove whether it is them investing into MC, or whether it is to support them.

The second part of it is that R&D on fundamental electronics is speeding up as Moore's law comes to saturation, rather than slowing down.

AMD is still the underdog and much of their strength has been from the relative weakness of their main competitor, if and when Intel starts taping out on TSMC 3nm the main competitive advantage of AMD will most likely be diminished.

If electrical vehicles are pushed on the US population you can double the demand for electricity nationwide (for the moment we will overlook that the electrical grid could never handle this increase).  At the same time you are doubling the demand for electricity, the government wants to cut fossil fuel use.  What is going to replace that 63% fossil fuel production?  A large chunk of it is going to be nuclear.  And nuclear plants run on uranium.  Factor in a bunch of countries already use a lot of uranium - Japan/France/et cetera - and globally all countries are moving away from fossil fuels under a new ""climate change accord"" and one can quickly see a massive demand for uranium.

So maybe hydrogen becomes popular in some commercial applications (metro, sanitation, etc)? Is there a feasible solution to the tank size required for long-haul journeys? Like what is the actual market size that hydrogen can feasibly take over if there is not a consumer-scale distribution network?

410,UK," I'm 32 from the UK. I have £10k I'm ready to pull the trigger on. My intention is long term investing for my future. I made good money earlier in the year but it was gambling - I had no idea what I was doing. I've now developed some patience and I'm looking for the right time to get into the market.

I'm sitting on the cash and instead spending my time reading books, keep tabs on financial news and doing my best to educate myself. Last year was a very easy year to make money and I'm in no two minds that I was lucky rather than smart.

Borrowing for the stock markets is high. No one is actually buying anything - everyone I know that's employed is saving their money for a rainy day. Considering the recent performance of the NASDAQ and the downturn with many of last years profitable stocks - is this the bursting of a bubble? Are we heading for a stock market crash?

414,GME," This is an honest question as I am not very knowledgeable about short selling and the exact nature of short contracts with banks.

The whole idea of a short squeeze like GME and others is based on the idea that eventually the hedge fund holding the short position will need to buy shares in order to return them to the broker/bank they were borrowed from.

However, in theory, if a hedge fund were squeezed and saw no way out, they could continue to hold their short position, selling off all their other securities in order to cover the ever-increasing premiums. Eventually, this would leave them with no assets besides the now functionally worthless shorts (Which no one will purchase as they would basically just be buying debt). The hedge fund could then declare bankruptcy and fold, ceasing to exist. The contract to buy and return the shares borrowed from the bank would no longer exist, as the hedge fund no longer exists, and the bank would be forced to eat a huge loss as there was no one left to cover. However, the short position would now be eliminated with no one forced to cover and the squeeze would never really occur.

There would obviously be major downsides for the managers of the hedge fund such as likely being a complete pariah in the financial sector, probably being investigated by the SEC, and likely being sued by the bank in order to go after your personal assets so I don't think any hedge fund would actually do that. That said...this is still a theoretically possible path for a hedge fund to go down when in a short squeeze is it not?

Again, I could be absolutely off base here and if I am, please tell me. I am just looking at the current GME situation and trying to understand if there are any ways for the hedge funds to get out of this.",bowsting,3,/r/investing/comments/l99f3n/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/glirrv1/,0.082,0.857,0.06,-0.7506

427,AMC," I am just reaching a position to start investing, so I opened a Wealthsimple account and transferred $5,000 in there - coincidentally right around the time of the whole GME, AMC, BB, Nokia fuss. My money should be deposited by Wednesday. I need advice on where to go from here - is it worth investing in any of these at this point, or I am too late? Are there other stocks I should be looking at?

Some quick facts:

* I’m in my late 20s, Canadian.
* I am employed, making approximately $76K before tax, $57K after tax.
* I currently have no major expenses.
* I have about $20K put away in savings.
* I have approximately $55K invested in real estate.
* I have no major debts (no mortgage, no student loans, no major credit card debt).
* I am looking to purchase a home in the next 5 years (I have other investments towards this goal), and saving/investing towards retirement by the time I am 50 (or earlier if I can make it happen). 

I mainly want to grow this money aggressively, as I am working on my other financial/life goals through other means. I am quite risk tolerant with this amount - I would be disappointed to lose it, but it won’t have a major impact on my financially. Most importantly, this is my first foray into stocks, and this money is a starting point to learn how to invest.

432,ABBV," Hello, 

I hope someone can help me or give me some ideas about my problem. 

I live in Turkey and want to invest in the US stock market. To be exact, I want to invest some of my money to one or two ETFs, and some of it to stocks. I probably can save $100 every month. 

The problem is, the cost of investing with this little money is too much. 

I opened an account with my own bank about this, and they charge minimum of $25 for a single transaction. I bought some ABBV a couple of months ago and although its price is up, I look like I'm at a loss (well, actually I really am!).

So I started to look for other options and came across to Webull. Investing with them is definitely going to help with that, but getting my money to that account is also expensive. I can't use ACH thing, because apparently it's only for American banks. So I need to make a wire transfer. Depositing using this method, Webull will charge $12,5 and my bank will charge $20 minimum (0,3% is the usual rate). 

Actually, withdrawing money from webull is also expensive. I won't do that frequently, so I don't mind that. 

The obvious solution to this is (to me), don't send money to Webull account monthly, but send it every 3-4 months. But can you guys think of any better way to handle this, and decrease my losses? 

&#x200B;

The other related question is, are brokers like webull good for long-term investing? Or should I look into another option after I have decent amount in that account?",kutubira,2,/r/investing/comments/l99f3n/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/glhu4ts/,0.032,0.866,0.102,0.9475

 5. Are buy/sales garenteed and instant or does it need to have someone doing the inverse at the same time for it to go through? Is it possible to make an order and not get it?

445,IT," Hi there. I'm here from r/wallstreetbets and they said that this would be the place to learn... I've been lurking for a couple hours and reading up, and I'm curious about advice you guys might have for me.

  
 How old are you? What country do you live in?  Are you employed/making income? How much? :  
I just turned 20 and in the military making roughly $32k/yr after tax. I do stuff like Door Dash and Postmates on the side for a little extra money.  


 What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?) :  
I currently have about $2k in savings. I don't have any goals as of right now (kind of why i'm posting this). A few small goals like finishing the sound system in my car ($400) or upgrading my PC ($1000), getting a surface pro 7 for when i'm out of town ($1500). I started putting about $1200 into savings a couple months ago. (IK that and my savings amount doesn't add up, i'll explain that later) and about $100/mo in stocks (80% return in the last year).  
I started a business with my dad last year and that's going decent. We just got a new opportunity in the last week and we're trying to get that rolling.  


 What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs? :  
Any money I put into stocks or anything else, I'm counting it as gone. I'm not planning on it touching my personal account for at least 5 years, if not until i retire.  


 What is your risk tolerance? :  
I'd say risk tolerance is relatively low - about 80% preferred confidence in safety.  
I'm okay with risks about $100 or less for now.  


Specific stocks I have a holding in: ($ - # of shares (profit/loss in $))

* $GPN - 1.2 (+42.22)
* $SPHD - 12.14 (+41.15)
* $ZNGA - 1 (+9.89) Free from Robinhood
* $F - 12 (+68.07)
* $TMUS - 0.884 (+16.38)
* $AMD - 2 (+65.58)
* $AAPL - 1.58 (+15.31)
* $AMZN - 0.079 (+5.31)
* $VOO - 0.4787 (+2.06)
* $VTI - 0.847 (+3.50)
* $MSFT - 0.1089 (+5.13)
* $MRNA - 0.156 (+17.29)
* $AMC - 5 (+2.80)
* $NOK - 5 (-2.55)
* $PHUN - 10 (-1.80)

$2.2k in at about +80% return in the last year

I made $15 profit from $BTC and $400 profit from $DOGE  


(I was told that fractional shares may be sold in the process of switching from robinhood to fidelity. all numbers above are from today and haven't changed since i initiated the transfer yesterday)

&#x200B;

Debts:  
Credit Card has like $20 on it - only used for gas  
Credit Builder Loan has $400 left (started at $1000) at 16% interest  
All other debt is paid off, which is why savings is lower than it should be  


I have about $800/mo in bills

446,GME," I am in the US, early 40s. I have a brokerage account with 10k in it, and want to grow that account to produce passive income to supplement my regular earnings. I can probably put in $500 a month (but it will hurt). More reasonable would be half that. I already have retirement savings (both 401k and Roth IRA) so that is not my concern. I don't really have a time horizon but would like to see yield/dividends quickly (don't we all?).

I'm already in a wide variety of ETFs but with a focus on domestic stock \~70%. I have 20% in foreign stock, 7% in bonds and the rest is a mish mash of stuff. I am a fairly aggressive investor, but have stayed away from pure stock investments, but am open to the possibility. These investments have generated a return of 11% this year (not great compared to the S&P 500). I don't have credit card debt, just student loans but I'll be paying those off in 2 years.

I'm wondering if its worth pulling out.

Kept about 5k for gamble money/fun (we'll not talk about that, but at least GME is doing well for me haha). The retiremrnt money is already down North of $14k in just a little over a week.

I'm wondering if I should just take it out while this blows over and put the money back in later. It's hard to stomach so much loss so quickly basically investing ATH and now its plummeting and I'd hate to see that money basically evaporate right after I put it in there and having to wait months to years to recover.

I know retirement is set and forget, time in market beats timing the market, blah blah, but I JUST put it in and now its bleeding. I dont think I'd need any of the money on the short term. At most, I'd need like 10% of I decide to buy a house sooner than originally planned. Otherwise, I have a HYSA for emergency fund/car fund/house fund.

454,OUT," 22 YEAR OLD PUNK TRYNNA MAKE IT OUT THE HOOD 

Daily Advice Thread - All basic help or advice questions must be posted here.

If your question is ""I have $10,000, what do I do?"" or other ""advice for my personal situation"" questions, you should include relevant information, such as the following:

* How old are you? What country do you live in?  
I’m 22 living in the United States 

* Are you employed/making income? How much?  
Graduated nursing school currently waiting to start RN job next month : pay ~ $65-75k/ yr 

* What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)  
I’d like to generate more money I can repurpose to try and max my IRA each year / liquid income potentially for rent & living expenses (still living at home with parents). 

* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?  
Want to see some gain within the next calendar year and continue to roll back into investments / pull to deposit into retirement. 

* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)  
50/50 

* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?) 
Roth-IRA maxed for the last 3 years with expected S&P returns - hope to continue that. Don’t hold any stocks but interested in getting into long term holdings / trying to run & play with short term holding. Assets, I run a side residential landscaping business ~12-18k/yr

* Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?  
No debt. No car payments

Since last Friday afternoon I’ve been noticing a dramatic shift from the original WSB feel, mood and expression.  The daily boards are gone, binary memes of the movement; heroes and villains are now the main attraction and the sole of what WSB represented is no where to be found.  

Crude & Vile is part of the sub and I loved it. But at the end we do watch for for each other, changed our views and most learned a thing or two however it was never a space where politics was a topic or driver of it’s momentum. 

However seems the events which took place last Thursday triggered an opportunity for political agendas to run ramped and morph a unlikely investment victory for the underdog into a totally different game, narrative,  sub reddit etc etc. 

It now feels very political, only leaving room for the anti and pro Wall Street.  That is not what I signed up for.  We have undergone some much division and now this movement is being highjacked by think tanks and interest groups which see an opportunity to weaponize what is taking place to further divide us.

465,IBKR," Hi, r/investing

Not sure if my question belongs exactly to this sub, so pardon me if it doesn't.

I'm seeking for opinions on choosing my broker for a very long-term investing and Stock trading. Due to my residency restrictions, the only two valid options for my case are either eToro or IBKR. I've already done my own reaserch checking for possible options, and, unfortunately, I'm only limited to these two brokers. The other options for me are either: a) too expensive in terms of trading costs (SAXO, or Swiss); b) looking really scammy/unreliable.

Currently I have open and fully verified accounts with both IBKR and eToro, but none of them is funded yet. I've read pretty much all articles on google about IBKR and eToro I could find. And among those I've also found a lot of controversial/negative material on both of these brokers, which kind of makes this decision to be more complicated than it should be.

- My initial trading capital for this year is 20k USD with a plan of adding 15-20k USD on annual basis;
- My main scope of interest: Spider ETFs, Vanguard ETFs, iShares ETFs, individual contents of SNP500 (rarely). Basically, all top high-cap US stocks/ETFs exclusively;
- Long-term trend trades (weeks / months / years) completely non-leveraged positions only. With fixed cap percentage-based exposure per trade, not more than 2.5-5.0% per instrument (due to high amount of instruments), and up to 65-70% cap exposure max at any given time. Pre-defined hard-capped risk per trade based off cap % (min 1%, max 2%);
- Main goal: preservation of capital > long-term gains >> mid-term gains >>>> short-term gains;

I don't really care about these brokers platform functionality, as I'm using third-party software for charting, analysis and market data streaming. I can live up with using web-site or mobile for orders, and I don't need that precise and lightning-fast execution for my trading. So when it comes to technical aspect of trading with these two brokers - I can live with both of their platforms and respective restrictions no problem.

What I do care about if safety of my money, basically. So far I'm more into eToro just because it looks more convenient to me in terms of trading costs, and absence of activity fees unlike with IBKR. Yes, you also pay activity fee with eToro, but you only pay it if there is no ""login"" activity for over 12 months, according to their web-site, so it's just non-existent. And as I'm not planning to do any day trading, I pretty much see the situations when there will be some months when I'll have to pay IBKR pretty much for nothing - it's 10 bucks, but still.",rekt4k,1,/r/investing/comments/l99f3n/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/glgx8fk/,0.06,0.853,0.087,0.9557

467,USA," Hello all,

I want to trade the Danish market but the catch is that I’m an American who is not in the USA (so the usual suspects of Schwab, Vanguard, Fidelity etc.) are not an option for me.

Other ones I have looked at like eToro also don’t accept non US-domiciled American citizens.  IG only does CFDs not actual real shares (like a lot of companies it seems) and Interactive Brokers doesn’t trade the Danish stock market.

I can’t even fake being domiciled in the US since I dont have W2 income (since I’m not in the USA) and Schwab has asked for mortgage contracts/rental bills/power bills/electric bills.

Does anyone have any ideas about either:

- Brokers that trade shares on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange
AND (hopefully but if not I’m glad to go find out and report back)
- Take non-US domiciled US citizens?

475,AR," Hi all,

Been lurking for a long time - finally created an account. First post.

I'm trying to write my own trading strategy. Would love some hard feedback.

I'm 35 years old. Going through a divorce. I make low 6-figures, which was recently cut in half by my ex-wife. I am starting several businesses this year, and beginning to consider trading and investing more seriously. My goal is to double my income this year in order to recover my losses from the divorce and get back to normal. Part of this plan involves trying to make smart investments that I trade in <1yr (no cap gains tax, right?)

My 5yr goal is to increase my total liquid wealth to over 1m. Currently I only have 50k saved/invested.

&#x200B;

Here's what I have so far:

\-------

**Trading Strategy**

**Objectives & Targets:**

1. Increase Annual Income w/ short-term trades/investments (from days to months?).
2. Nothing held longer than a year (this is for my 401k) to avoid cap gains tax
3. Increase annual income by 50-100k in 2021
4. Make well-researched investments that will yield greater than 50% returns within 1-2yr
5. Do not jeopardize my family’s standard of living - only invest/trade what I can afford to lose
6. Bring in more revenue to invest more if needed

**Strategy Summary**

* Put \~100% of disposable income into well-researched investments with the goal of finding those that are about to explode and yield high returns. Willing to hold for 3 mo to < 1 year if needed. Goal is to find companies that I feel will pop within 3-6months. If not, Will hold longer or wait it out until losses are mitigated if updated DD shows less likelihood of a big % gain.
* Not a buy and hold, not a day trading plan - more of a...heavy DD and try to enter the right company at the right time? If not, hold to mitigate losses and continue to funnel income into more investments. Diversity to sell high when things pop. Hold the rest and do more DD.

**Sectors I'm Well-Versed In:**

1. Food and beverage & Plant-based
2. Telecommunications and its peripherals
   1. 5G, VR, AR, AV, EV, Telemed, Cloud, Edge
3. Education

**Trading Personality / Risk Tolerance:**

* Patient + Risky. Not afraid to take risks, or see lots of fluctuation. I know that time in the market leads to gains typically. Likely to wait it out and have increased time in the market until losses are recovered or mitigated.
* Unwilling to overextend myself - only playing with / investing disposable income
* Motivated by the rush of trading, but really enjoy the DD part of the process

**Rules:**

* Re-invest/trade no greater than 50% of trading earnings
* Replenish trade account with disposable income monthly
   * Do not pull from savings / other investments to re-invest when down, or to jump into another position prematurely abandoning any DD you have done
* Clearly define target for each trade based on DD, then set limits and hold for specified amount of time based on each situation
   * If down more than X% at specified time interval (1mo? 3mo? 6mo?), update DD and HOLD until recovered for X time (3 more mo?).
* Stay within business verticals that you are well-versed in

**Example:**

BHAT

* Rationale: companies on the periphery of 5G are often overlooked during this wave. Countless new industries will rise rapidly. AR/VR are still in testing labs to find out capabilities and commercial applications. AR/VR for education - growing demand for virtual and online school will not halt. Especially in China. Need for an immersive and engaged at-home learning environment. Highly scalable. Also diversified into gaming - potential for acquisition model high. Aligns with Comm party’s goals and vision
* Buy in and hold for 3 months then reevaluate unless I double my money, then sell
* If still climbing, or DD shows likely to climb, buy back in
* IPO within past few years
* Spread from 0.50 to 2.30 over 2020. Currently at 1.33
* Just announced prelim earnings on Friday - rev up 70% (20M)
* Buy in at 1.30 -> Hold until breaks the $3. Mark then sell. At end of year, if up more than 50%, sell. If not, Hold and treat as long-term investment",Less_Education_6809,1,/r/investing/comments/l99f3n/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/glhkvzc/,0.048,0.886,0.066,0.9269

I'm trying to write my own trading strategy. Would love some hard feedback.

I'm 35 years old. Going through a divorce. I make low 6-figures, which was recently cut in half by my ex-wife. I am starting several businesses this year, and beginning to consider trading and investing more seriously. My goal is to double my income this year in order to recover my losses from the divorce and get back to normal. Part of this plan involves trying to make smart investments that I trade in <1yr (no cap gains tax, right?)

My 5yr goal is to increase my total liquid wealth to over 1m. Currently I only have 50k saved/invested.

&#x200B;

Here's what I have so far:

\-------

**Trading Strategy**

**Objectives & Targets:**

1. Increase Annual Income w/ short-term trades/investments (from days to months?).
2. Nothing held longer than a year (this is for my 401k) to avoid cap gains tax
3. Increase annual income by 50-100k in 2021
4. Make well-researched investments that will yield greater than 50% returns within 1-2yr
5. Do not jeopardize my family’s standard of living - only invest/trade what I can afford to lose
6. Bring in more revenue to invest more if needed

**Strategy Summary**

* Put \~100% of disposable income into well-researched investments with the goal of finding those that are about to explode and yield high returns. Willing to hold for 3 mo to < 1 year if needed. Goal is to find companies that I feel will pop within 3-6months. If not, Will hold longer or wait it out until losses are mitigated if updated DD shows less likelihood of a big % gain.
* Not a buy and hold, not a day trading plan - more of a...heavy DD and try to enter the right company at the right time? If not, hold to mitigate losses and continue to funnel income into more investments. Diversity to sell high when things pop. Hold the rest and do more DD.

**Sectors I'm Well-Versed In:**

1. Food and beverage & Plant-based
2. Telecommunications and its peripherals
   1. 5G, VR, AR, AV, EV, Telemed, Cloud, Edge
3. Education

**Trading Personality / Risk Tolerance:**

* Patient + Risky. Not afraid to take risks, or see lots of fluctuation. I know that time in the market leads to gains typically. Likely to wait it out and have increased time in the market until losses are recovered or mitigated.
* Unwilling to overextend myself - only playing with / investing disposable income
* Motivated by the rush of trading, but really enjoy the DD part of the process

**Rules:**

* Re-invest/trade no greater than 50% of trading earnings
* Replenish trade account with disposable income monthly
   * Do not pull from savings / other investments to re-invest when down, or to jump into another position prematurely abandoning any DD you have done
* Clearly define target for each trade based on DD, then set limits and hold for specified amount of time based on each situation
   * If down more than X% at specified time interval (1mo? 3mo? 6mo?), update DD and HOLD until recovered for X time (3 more mo?).
* Stay within business verticals that you are well-versed in

**Example:**

BHAT

* Rationale: companies on the periphery of 5G are often overlooked during this wave. Countless new industries will rise rapidly. AR/VR are still in testing labs to find out capabilities and commercial applications. AR/VR for education - growing demand for virtual and online school will not halt. Especially in China. Need for an immersive and engaged at-home learning environment. Highly scalable. Also diversified into gaming - potential for acquisition model high. Aligns with Comm party’s goals and vision
* Buy in and hold for 3 months then reevaluate unless I double my money, then sell
* If still climbing, or DD shows likely to climb, buy back in
* IPO within past few years
* Spread from 0.50 to 2.30 over 2020. Currently at 1.33
* Just announced prelim earnings on Friday - rev up 70% (20M)
* Buy in at 1.30 -> Hold until breaks the $3. Mark then sell. At end of year, if up more than 50%, sell. If not, Hold and treat as long-term investment",Less_Education_6809,1,/r/investing/comments/l99f3n/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/glhkvzc/,0.048,0.886,0.066,0.9269

483,AMC," I am 28 years old, single, and make 30k a year in a field where I could potentially jump to 60k after a few more years of experience. 

When starting with a low investment ($1000), would it be better to try to get more capital quickly by playing the volitility slot machine or just go straight into the long term plays like ETFs or Apple/Microsoft type stocks?

I know the slot machine is very risky but it seems like you'd have a much better time doing long plays with like 10k worth of capital rather than a measly 1k.

Basically, if you hit on a bunch of low cost potential doubles, you'd be able to kickstart your investing much quicker than a safer, long term play that goes up maybe 10% a year. For example I could only buy like 7 shares of Apple or I could buy 80 of AMC. Obviously these are only 2 examples but the thought process is the same.

I specifically bought BB two weeks ago because I thought it would have more volatility and wanted to sell and roll covered calls on it weekly as long as it made sense to. I still made money on the trade, so I'm only losing theoretical future money at this point, but I still feel robbed.

Is this something worth complaining about to them or asking for remediation? Again, my time during business hours is limited, so I don't want to be on hold for an hour for no reason. Thanks for your ideas.

Also, if you feel that this post doesn't belong here can you suggest some other good subs.

Anyways, the first stock I was thinking about getting was ACES. It's an etf for clean energy and I think that is important now because of the current administration's approach with the environment. It is also relatively cheap ($91.62) but still seems to keep going up. With the growing concern for our environment I feel that this would be a good investment. Feel free to recommend any other etfs i should look into to.

The second stock I was thinking about getting was GM. They have plans to release more electric cars. With recent legislation I think this would definitely be a good investment. GM has also really spiked since JAN. 2020.

The third stock I was looking into was DAL. Before Covid it was pretty stable and now it's about half the price it was. My thought is that once covid clears up it will skyrocket.

The fourth stock I was looking at was WKHS. WKHS is another car company that is electric and it has been going up since JAN. 2020. I truly think it can be the tesla of delivery. It's also still pretty cheap ($34.96).

Two other stocks I was looking at were IDEX and BLSP. These are really low stocks but I think if I hold these for a long time they can become big players. They are centered around clean energy and have potential.

It is also relatively cheap ($91.62) but still seems to keep going up. With the growing concern for our environment I feel that this would be a good investment. Feel free to recommend any other etfs i should look into to.

The second stock I was thinking about getting was GM. They have plans to release more electric cars. With recent legislation I think this would definitely be a good investment. GM has also really spiked since JAN. 2020.

The third stock I was looking into was DAL. Before Covid it was pretty stable and now it's about half the price it was. My thought is that once covid clears up it will skyrocket.

The fourth stock I was looking at was WKHS. WKHS is another car company that is electric and it has been going up since JAN. 2020. I truly think it can be the tesla of delivery. It's also still pretty cheap ($34.96).

Two other stocks I was looking at were IDEX and BLSP. These are really low stocks but I think if I hold these for a long time they can become big players. They are centered around clean energy and have potential.

506,GME," Here's what I don't understand about the GME situation:

When you short a stock you're required to hold 150% of the value of your short in your account as collateral (https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortmarginrequirements.asp)

As the stock increases you have to add dollars to your account for maintenance margin to ensure you have the assets to cover the short as it continues to rise.

So how do Robinhood and others say they don't have the money to cover all these shorts on GME??? Isn't that supposed to be covered by margin requirements??

508,GME," Same age and country as you so. Whatever you do use an ISA. It’s a complete tax wrapper, all the money you make in an ISA is untaxed, you can only put £20k per year across two ISA (one cash, one stocks and shares) but no matter how much it grows it’s all yours.

If you have a higher risk tolerance (which it sounds like you do) I would suggest opening a share trading ISA account with IG (once they allow new accounts after this GME silliness). Pick 15 companies across a broad spectrum (some large cap, some mid cap and a couple of small, maybe even recently gone public, cap) split it evenly (or as evenly as you can since IG don’t allow fractional shares purchases) and then review every 3 months and make sure no one company has grown to an uncomfortable percentage of the portfolio, sell a bit and reinvest into something else if it has.

Don’t worry about the cost of a share, worry about the total market cap of the company, do you think that number will grow? Is apple likely to grow fro 2T to 20? Not in the short term, could fiverr grow from 20B to 200B? In 5 years? Maybe. But higher risk.

If you don’t want to faff on with the above then pick a managed portfolio ISA with someone like Ageon/Nationwide (to be honest, you should think about doing this anyway and putting 30% of you money in there) - in fact, thinking while I type, you should have a portion of this 10K in something stable and spread across a number of companies like an index fund and you can do this through IG.

I’ve always thought in pots to be filled appropriately:

Pot 1: cash on hand, low return, very liquid
Pot 2: managed fund, slightly less liquid, slightly higher returns
Pot 3: individual company shares, higher risk, might be down when you need the money though forcing you to sell when you don’t want to

518,GME," 1.	Questrade is good 
2.	Markets closed on the weekend - if you have the proper broker you can trade after hours. Trades made after hours are honoured. You buy something for a price and own it at that price.

3.	Limit orders on day are probably most common and safe for buying. 
4.	Yes. This is called a stop loss and you can set these types of orders in Questrade 
5.	Every order has to have the inverse. This is Bid/Ask spread. Buyers want the Bid price and sellers want the Ask price. For something to exchange the Bid/Ask needs to meet. Look up “order book” for a visual. 
6.	there’s plenty of safe stocks out there. Familiarize yourself with ETFs. If you want something long turn with safe upside buy something like a S&P 500 ETF. Most people buy ETFs for safe long term plays and allocate additional capital on individual stocks that fit their risk profile.

1-The risk and reward are both extremely high and nobody can honestly say they know what’s going to happen.

More regulation might come, more short interest might like in as the price plummets, men stock investors may get distracted by other crazy fun ideas or just lose interest. 

2-You should only invest money that you won’t feel bad about losing.  GME could be back under $50 by end of week, which would be an 85% loss for your investment at this point.

It also helps in recruiting. Top talent wants to work from the top names. It's a prestige thing. It's part of Google's competitive advantage. Not that I expect that to make any substantial difference short-term, but from the Buffett perspective of what company I wanna own, like Coca Cola and Nike, I want to own the brand consumers like.

I know you probably don't want to give me a course in the Questrade UI, they have help pages and everything but I still want to make sure I won't do something stupid, so a second validation would be appreciated.

So even though bid and bid size is currently at 0, they allow me to create an order right now, is that because the broker support after hour trades as you mentioned? Is there any downside or should I wait for the markets to be open?

So there's 3 settings, the ""limit price"" which is the maximum value I would be willing to pay over the current price, and the ""bracket order"" profit and loss, which would be prices I would set for an automatic sale after I got my buy order fulfilled. Is that right?

560,GME," Sure. Plenty of people have heard of GME and are now under the false belief that it's quick and easy money. This is not the case. You need to do lots of research into industries that are ready to capitalize on world events and get in early.

Let's say you see on the news that the government may legalize cannabis. Will there be a demand for that cannabis? If so who is in the best position to fill that demand? Will this lead to an increase in demand for snacks? Who is in the best position to fill that demand? How are the snacks getting from supplier to retailer? Will they see an increase in demand? What ingredients do they use? Will they see an increase in demand?

Point is it takes a lot of research. Once a market starts to move due to an announcement then you're already getting in too late. 

I can't recommend a specific stock if that's what you're after. Will green tech take off soon? Maybe. Can they fill the energy needs? Maybe not. So what's the outcome? This is what I'm working on at the moment. Governments are swaying towards climate friendly energy but the technology is not ready to fulfil the demand.

Look at IG - facebook bought instagram and since then have continually borrowed from competitors in order to evolve instagram's competitive advantage. Isn't that basically how snapchat died? They have enough resources to do everything their competitors do in terms of social media should they wish.

Re: chance of mass exodus - this is unlikely IMO. As much as people talk about privacy, I think there is also a fair amount of resignation in this space as it has become clear that it is extremely difficult to be online and to be private at the same time.

A key point: People's connections to their friends and family and to even celebrities etc overrides a lot of concerns about everything else. I would actually argue that this is FB's core value. People will moan all day about privacy and about coercion, but still stay on the apps because of that psychological value. ie. they tap into one of the key drivers of human behavior: BELONGING.

Plus unless everyone else migrates platforms at the same time, it just becomes so hard to move because of the perceived loss of those connections. FB and its other apps are still safe, so long as they stay competitive and evolve. The need to be connected, to belong etc are so deep within most people that they will stick for those reasons alone. And if they move, FB can adapt/evolve/move with them.  


Most people do not like change. Moving is hard work, and having to build new followers and/or tell everyone to come find you on X new platform is hard work.

I deleted my Facebook account a good few years ago. I hate that they have stepped into Instagram and What's app. I don't necessarily mind giving up my IG account.. but what's app I would find harder because family members who I speak to several times a day use it.

Facebook will continue to do what it's doing with its other outlets and ensure that users are tied to FB in one way or another.

At this point in time, given the company's reach, unless they get extremely lazy or just stop trying, they still have a gigantic monetizable data advantage well above and beyond most other companies.",Square-Grab-5644,2,/r/investing/comments/l9hi1j/is_facebooks_moat_widening_or_shrinking_my/glikdoh/,0.085,0.826,0.089,-0.621
577,FB," Acquiring Instagram was the single biggest thing Facebook did to create their seemingly impenetrable moat. And the biggest risk to Facebook is anti-trust action that could split off Instagram (and potentially other subsidiaries) from Facebook.

What makes you ""generally not concerned"" about anti-trust action? I've studied the big tech companies pretty closely, and Facebook faces by far the biggest risk of serious anti-trust action (Google is #2; Apple and Amazon could face some regulation around their third-party markets, but nothing on the scale of the worst case scenarios for FB & G).

No one knows what the future holds, but there's been a growing consensus in both political parties that tech needs more regulation. Facebook is a prime candidate, and the risk of Instagram being split off is very serious. I wouldn't place a bet on whether or not it will happen, but I also wouldn't bet hard on $FB at this juncture (there's certainly a compelling case to do so, but it's riskier than any other big tech stock rn)",kickit,2,/r/investing/comments/l9hi1j/is_facebooks_moat_widening_or_shrinking_my/glipqu5/,0.109,0.797,0.094,-0.5861

Also snapchat is not dead.  Take a look at SNAP

Fb tried to copy snapchat and as far as i know failed.  They also have instagram reels which is a copy of tiktok - i dont know how well that is doing.  with a terrible reputation fb cant afford to follow behind the social media trends.  Tiktok came out of nowhere and gained a 100 million followers alone in the usa in 2 yrs

593,NAD," Tax implications on muni ETFs are hard to exploit. Your best bet would be dividend harvesting every 6 months.  You have to hold the underlying for 6 months for the distributions to be tax-free, so you buy before the ex-div day, hold for 6 months, sell on the next ex-div day.  Tax-free on the dividends and you can write off the cap gains loss.  If you leverage this with a 6-month credit box spread, you can write off the implied interest as a cap gains loss as well.  With the standard margin requirements for individuals, and assuming a top tax bracket, you are probably maxing out at like 5-6ish percent effective (ie pre-tax) annual gains using something like MUB and 8-9ish (with way more risk) using a CEF like NAD.
