41,NIO,"I had the same mentality. But recently I’ve been adjusting my thinking. I think short term calls are risky. 

But if you can buy leaps (prolly won’t find much of that for penny stocks tho) one year out minimum, it’s like you’re buying stock with leverage. 

Essentially a fraction of the money is needed to make the same potential profit. 

For example I wish I had got NIO calls for Jan 22 as soon as they became available because that same amount of money I had in equity could have been far more valuable in call options instead. 

Or I could have used less money for the same profit potential, and then bought more leap options for a different stock, allowing me to diversify with less money than I actually have in a sense. It’s margin, except the interest cost is theta decay. But if you’re good at knowing what’s a good longish term investment and can wait the time period you can make a lot I believe. 

Please take this info with a grain of salt as I’ve only just started getting back into options after losing $1500 and swearing them off several years ago. Logically tho it makes sense based on the math",0.043,0.837,0.12,0.9468

102,RF,"This device does not diagnose cancer. Read the (only) feasibility study. It was only useful for 19 of 26 study participants, they had to reject the data for 7 of them. And that's in a study that they designed where every variable was controlled, not in an actual hospital or clinical setting with ""real"" patients. 

Liver elastography is also a thing and has been used to quantitatively measure liver tissue characteristics for years, and it does so in real-time without having to switch probes. The promotional videos make this product's tech seem way further along. It cannot be used simultaneously with b-mode ultrasound. You have to find an adequate window, mark it, then switch over to the special TAEUS unit, then compare the data to the ultrasound to make sure the readings correspond to the different tissue layers on ultrasound. With elastography you use a standard ultrasound probe and press a button.

EDIT: Also the TEAUS probe itself is huge, and looks double the size of a standard curved abdominal probe. So to get this tech to the point where it can actually be used with ultrasound in real-time it (and current ultrasound probes) need to shrink considerably. I'm not even sure if it's actually possible given that the piezoelectric crystals in modern ultrasound probes are lead zirconate and how that would work with this technology, which uses RF.",0.011,0.913,0.076,0.9219

Traditionally, you would need to pay a fee to exercise your contract, and a commission to sell your shares, which would result in a smaller profit than simply selling the contract. Since most options are closed before expiration, they will still have time value. When you exercise an option, that time value is lost.",0.053,0.805,0.142,0.7351
273,RH,"1. Interest on margin is actually low, but you must have the money above the margin maintenance level. Drop below that RH will force you to liquidate your position, or you have to deposit more money. This is what we call Margin Call.
2. Margin lets you deposit more than 1K at a time without having to wait for 5 business days.
3. You can leverage margin to day trade.
4. To payback the margin, you have to set the margin back to 0 manually. For example, if you **deposit more money but don't sell the stocks, and you don't set the margin back to 0, RH still charges you the fees daily**

Edit: I want to clarify about number 4 by giving an example.

**Let say** you buy 5 stocks A, at $1/share. You use margin $2 to buy 2 additional shares. You have 7 shares in total  
After a few days, you deposit $2 to your RH account. You think margin has been paid back, but nope you're wrong. You have to do one more step, and there are two ways to do it:  


\-1st method (exit your position): you sell the 2 shares that you use the margin to buy. Then, manually set the margin back to 0

\-2nd method (hold to your position): Go to margin, set back to 0. RH then takes your deposit to pay back the margin without having to liquidate your position.  


**Too long don't read, then read this** **Summary**: 

\-It is an extremely bad practice to buy stock using margin and diamond hand for the long term because you have to pay for interest and a margin call can force you out of your position when the tide goes against you.

\-You should only leverage margin for day trade, and make sure to set it back to 0 at the end of the day.

274,BB,Ok that makes sense now I hope. So just so I can say it out loud I deposit 1k and used up my initial 1k margin I want to buy BB at $14 dip monday and I buy 1k and make 1k deposit which won't be available till like Friday so margin will cover me Monday to make the buy and once my deposit clears I can set margin back to $0 since I'm no longer using it? And I can do this every time I make deposit?,0.025,0.853,0.122,0.7476
275,RH,"No difference. RH gold does not matter, you still have to adhere to 3 day trades per week. Your **pure assets** have to be more than 25K. 

\->"" I thought if i sold my stock it would be in my rh account so wouldn't that reset my margin to 0 ""

I apologize, I just edited my comment about #4 to clarify that misunderstanding.

Manually set the margin back to 0 is a good practice.

To set the margin back to 0, you go back to your RH gold tab, there should be a margin amount button somewhere. You clear out the default number and set it back to 0.",0.057,0.867,0.076,0.2792
276,BB,"Let me rephrase what you are asking, and clarify

1. **Scenario 1**: You deposit 1k. You use that only 1K to buy $BB. This 1K is defined as instant deposit, not margin. You don't use any margin so you don't have to set the margin back to $0
2. **Scenario 2**: You deposit 1K. You then set the margin to 1K in the margin tab. Now you have 2K to play with instead of 1K, this is a margin play. Make sure to set the margin back 0 after you exit the trade.

**Summary**: margin and instant deposit are totally different. Don't get confused.",0.0,0.915,0.085,0.7942
