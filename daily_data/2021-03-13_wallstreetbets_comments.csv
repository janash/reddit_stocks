0,GME," Used unrealized GME gains to adopt a gorilla. [Also got a video.](https://gorillafund.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/urn.mp4?eType=CommSeriesComponent&eId=3a22d556-b96d-4e1b-9f1a-a7dbf2499970)

EDIT: This Gorilla species is called the Mountain Gorilla, they are an **endangered species** due to:

* Poaching: gorillas can be worth $thousands on black markets.

* Disease: transmitted by human-gorilla or livestock-gorilla.

* War: Countries in Central Africa, Uganda/Rwanda/DRC are in various stages of stability to instability.

* Encroaching by human populations: due to poverty, logging, and preemptive hunting by locals to ward off ""threats"".

Due to conservation and education efforts it is estimated that the Mountain gorillas population has rebounded to a little over 1,000.

#**EDIT 2: Please stop giving this post rewards as much as I appreciate them, there are MANY MANY wonderful charities and organizations that can use even $1 in donations.**

Options newbies!! Please learn the MECHANICS of options before you start trading!

I see a lot of new options traders here with questions about what happens at expiry, etc. You‚Äôve done some homework, figured out long calls = bullish, long puts = bearish and think you‚Äôre ready to play. 

Before you start yolo‚Äôing please learn about expiration, exercising, etc. Not every brokerage has the same process for dealing with ITM options at expiry. Do NOT wait until 2 PM on Friday of expiry to sell/ exercise. Do NOT assume your brokerage will automatically sell for you or auto exercise- go to their website or call and ask. Understand if you exercise you need to have cash in your account to take delivery. It‚Äôs pretty rare that exercising is the best course of action. Frankly most options buyers should just take exercising out of their vocabulary. (And no, exercising calls doesn‚Äôt cause a short squeeze) 

Understand assignment in short options. You likely won‚Äôt be notified until Sat or Monday of assignment. Understand pin risk. Understand that options buyers have until 5:30 on Friday to notify their broker of their intention to exercise so if you sell an option that is OTM on Friday at 4 PM and the stock makes a huge move AH you can get absolutely screwed. 

Bottom line - save yourself a headache and **close out your trades before 3 PM on Friday** it might be 2 PM for RH.

96,GOOD," Question... 

Im new to options, but so far Im having some serious beginners luck.

I bought a VaicomCBS $90 3/19 for $126.00 on 3/8 when the stock price was $77.00

Over the next few days leading up to yesterday, I watched it jump from negative numbers all the way to $500. This was with it nowhere near the strike price. 

Ive had some serious issues with exit strategies and when to be happy and take a profit. I had a conversation with myself Thursday that if it got back to $600, Id take it and be happy. And Friday morning, I did. I sold it for $900 at about 10 a.m... right as it neared the strike price and with a WEEK of time value left! Sold it, was happy and then checked ViacomCBS to see it had passed the strike price.

It ended the AH session at $95.40... $5.40 above my strike price. My knuckles drag and show my shame. Dumb ass ape.

I wonder how much I let go with that decision. Sold it on the way up. Nice.

So, my question is, did I do the right thing? I took a GOOD profit for my investment and I sold the contract for $900. Did it sell because I left room for others to take profit? Is that a good practice? Sell on the way up for a ‚Äúsure sell‚Äù? Or hold till the last bit has been juiced and attempt to sell the contract?

In any case, Ive learned one helluva lesson. This is a numbers game, not a money game. When you let yer wallet make the decisions, yer gonna lose. I lost focus and panic sold. Premature ejak at its finest.

Neat.

120,GME," (You might not be talking about selling calls, but I'll tell you what's up anyways.) ""Naked"" usually refers to selling options. I guess technically buying an option is also ""naked"", but people don't usually say that. Whenever someone buys a call option, someone else is on the other end of the trade selling it to them. If you sell a call, you collect premium while giving someone else the option to buy 100 shares at the strike price. If you own 100 shares of the stock, then your call is covered; if you don't then it's naked. You can also technically ""cover"" a sold call by also buying a call at a different strike price to make it into a ""vertical spread"".

Selling naked calls is an especially bad idea if you're a smooth-brained ü¶ç because it essentially has infinite risk. Imagine a few weeks back when GME was trading at $60.  Pretend you decided to sell a $100 call expiring on 3/12 because you thought GME was NOT gonna go up (we're playing pretend, remember). Well, GME went up over 160 points past your strike price of 100, so now your call that you sold has gone up (100 shares x 160 points =)$16,000 worth up value. So if you didn't close it and let it expire In The Money (ITM), you're forced to sell 100 shares of GME that you don't have. Your broker will take care of that part for you, but you stoll got fucked in the ass to the tune of 16 grand that you probably don't even have.

If you just see a big loss in general, it's usually people buying OTM calls or puts that expire worthless, though.",GoodLowered,19,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4a87a/i_teach_high_school_which_means_i_explain_things/gqtmetr/,0.119,0.779,0.103,-0.7218
121,DKNG," So when you buy a call contract you now own that contract. It is yours. That contract constantly changes price because other people buy them too. When I bought the .80 65c 3/12 someone sold that to me and got the $80 from me. 

Now as time goes on the value of the contract changes. If the stock goes up it goes up too. The amount it goes up varies but once it changes from OTM to ITM is the biggest jump. So as DKNG went up my contract‚Äôs value went up until that Thursday when it hit $8.00. Because again people buy those contracts. So I could sell the 65c I had for the next day for $8.00 a share or $800.

I pay the first fee, I check that it goes through a month later, and I see the $150 added to my total cost. I call to ask, and ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just the system, it‚Äôs how it works‚Äù

 ‚ÄúWell, can it be waived? Obviously I‚Äôm paying it in installments because I can‚Äôt afford to front that much money all at once right now. Why should the punishment for being poor be to owe more than half of the original ticket on top of the ticket price‚Äù

 ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just the way it is.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay. Then why offer the option to pay it in installments at all unless the intent is to extort more money from the people who already can‚Äôt afford to do anything about it‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause that‚Äôs the law.‚Äù

Here's where I'm a little confused, lets say (please forgive me i'm not using the terminology correctly):

1. I currently have 0 shares of GME; I buy a call on 3/12 for 100 shares of GME - 1 $2 GME $300c 3/19 for $200 (are number of shares not listed?)
2. Next day 3/13 the Share price goes up to 330 and premium goes up to $5

At this point lets say I sell the call and make $3 profit/share for a total of $500. Now lets say the share and premium go up the next day and the person I sold it to exercises it.

My point i‚Äôm making here, I will never short. You are at infinite risk, that is a position you never want to be in.

Yes, someone will tell me to calm down, some people short for a price down, whatever, screw all that risk.

What I absolutely love about GME, it is a battle ground. The boomers & the seasoned traders & investors like me know in the back of our head that retail will eventually lose on GME. That is because the fundamentals aren‚Äôt clicking here but you know what? Forget their prescribed notion that things have to be operating normally.  Nothing about GME is normal. The people that want retail to lose are scared of the change, not the results. We don‚Äôt care if you all get rich off GME, that is great.

161,GME," Truth. Like with everything else, it's not sufficient to label an entire practice as immoral. In a free market, like a free society, the only way to be objectively immoral is to trample on the freedoms of others.

While many of the short whales have done this with GME, and naked shorts are objectively fuelled by their ability to crush capital availability to certain companies.... there are plenty of shortsellers market-wide who simply are achieving profit by predicting that a more accurate valuation of X stock is below today's market value.

GME is a unique situation in that it brought in a lot of people who don't care for markets but are here for a class struggle, which is a fair label, but only to an extent. As Glenn Greenwald said in late January: ""Traditionally, if you hold beliefs in good faith... if you are on the right, you believe the government's role is to protect its citizens by protecting a free market; if you are on the left, you see the government's role as intervention on the behalf of the most needy.... what we have in 2021 is neither."" So a lot of the influx of new members is here to witness a class struggle firsthand, which is cool. This mixes with a belief held by people across the political spectrum that elites crushing poors is a problem. A number of the HFs that are trying to cripple Gamestop have done this before with other companies, and made tons off COVID lockdowns, etc.

But I'd be lying through my teeth if I were to say that I'll never take a short interest in a company again. That's just cathartic speak from a sect of moral absolutists who will either not be here in a few months, or it's an emotional promise from WSB vets who are mistaking the moral deviations of Citadel, Melvin, etc for the shortcomings of a practice that theoretically  drives close to half of the market over time.

The companies decided to offer free trading and user friendly apps. Wanting them to follow the rules while using what they chose to offer is not ""just wanting shit for free.""

Just one example, customers are required to get ""best execution"" from the ones handling their shares. Obviously, this is to prevent the ones handling your shares from not handling them in YOUR best interest (because you have no choice but to trust them to do the trade).

So, to meet this requirement, while not actually giving you what the plain meaning of ""best execution"" would suggest, they make up a new level of ""enhanced best execution,"" which was briefly brought up during the first GME hearing.

So, if someone else is getting ""enhanced best execution,"" can you really say you're getting the ""best execution""?

197,GME," When GME had the big dip last week, a large number of new outlets were right there (within a minute or less across different sources, you may draw your own conclusions) with the same ""GME was doing alright but look it's crashing now"" story.

It should also be considered that media coverage of last week's encouraging GME performance was completely absent up to that point - just a variable to stick into the equation.

So people caught mw when they published their story about the gme dip **before the dip actually happened**. Just by a few minutes, but the mw story was confirmed to have been published while GME was still peaking. mw updated the text of the story, but forgot to update the URL of the page - the url is usually auto generated according to the story title. Users took this information and were able to find that Google had actually indexed the mw story much earlier.

This implies a) foreknowledge by mw; and possibly b) coordination of news releases between a subset of news outlets. If someone put together a list of the sites publishing stories right after the dip I bet there would be a common thread behind them.

284,RKT," Ummm I don‚Äôt think you understand how momentum driving works and how hedge funds take advantage of their extreme liquidity.       

Example:     
A hedge fund runs as a trading desk with 30+ different traders(high number). With $1b in liquidity that gives the traders roughly 33m each. When they go into the morning briefing, there is a list of stocks that they talk about as a team. The entire team writes down notes on the different keys that a hedge fund might look at whether it‚Äôs 5,10,15 ema and minute spacing or planned news announcements. Now with $33m each, they are all targeting the same stock, but since each trader has a different trading technique it is not considered manipulation or insider trading. For instance: you might have an options trader buying otm options at open while it drops for 5-15 minutes, then when the momentum starts to reverse you might see other traders start buying itm call options to drive the price/delta up. While all of this going on, other parties might be replicating similar moves or adding positions with buy at ask orders. After a set time frame that all the traders will be looking for as indicators of reversal, the otm options will likely sell first and cover with an extreme amount of otm puts, then everyone would attempt to drop their positions simultaneously while picking up hedges to drive the price down. Keep in mind, a hedge fund having $1b of liquidity is probably on the lower end. With $1b of liquidity and over $300m of that being used to trade options(itm and otm, while staying spread out) they can have 2-50x exposure which at $300m is a lot of leverage to have on a stock.           

To my point above: citadel released a news announcement about how they had a ton of calls, a ton of puts, and ridiculous amounts of shares in RKT. They were able to single handedly cause a gamma squeeze and mini short squeeze just buy filling position and forcing people to cover due to high risk which sent the prices sky high in aftermarket/premarket where they were subsequently able to exercise and sell their shares for profit while having the puts as a hedge, and selling the puts once they ran out of shares and hitting profit on both the upswing and down swing.           

That‚Äôs only 1 example of how hedge funds and trading desks use their positions and liquidity to take over the markets and get people to buy high and sell low. It is also how hedge funds are able to drive costs, so people get margin called when it falls. When that happens the brokerage makes tons of money because not only did they buy the stock when it was low via margin call, they can now use the position to drive the stock in whatever direction they want. The reason why you will never hear any complaints about manipulation and price driving by hedge funds is because the broker like schwab or robinhood make immense amounts of money when their clients get margin called and the broker can diamond hand their way to gains because they have an inside track on direction. Look up how much brokerages earn from margin trading and margin calls, not related to margin loans.        

Keep in mind, the same things have had a history of repeating itself throughout history. Everything has a tendency of repeating itself even if it shows up in a different name.",TreeHugChamp,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m42sto/meanwhile_in_australia/gqsv31q/,0.028,0.899,0.073,0.9782

405,GME," No, the calls' strike price is $25, and the call is currently worth $241.33(x100, for 100 shares) per contract, with a quantity of 10 contracts. = $241,330.00 total value of all contracts

Meaning that he bought the contracts thinking that GME would go above $25. And now he is very far ITM (in the money), with GME at $265

If you subtract the current value of the contracts by the total return so far, you can find how much was originally paid for them. 

$241,330 - $235,730 = $5,600 for 10 contracts = $560 paid per contract

$560/100 shares = $5.60 original contract pricing. $5.60 --> $241.33 = $235.73 gain per contract price. 

$235.73 gain in contract price, x100 shares, x10 contracts = $235,730 total return

Imho he got bailed out by COVID because the low passenger rate put the final nail in the coffin to the biggest planes and made the 737max more attractive comparatively. 

Also it gave Boeing more time to get their shit figured out and legal again, and the Airline stimulus helped make up for all the losses of grounded 737 maxes which again were down BEFORE COVID

I'd say when the majority of ALL of the entire fleets are grounded (no matter what kind of plane), the Airline companies are going to be more forgiving then if only one specific type of plane was grounded for years

This wasn't too logical for the sub. This dude belongs here. Remember he wasn't JUST betting the 737max recovered, he bought calls, he put a damn timeline on this shit.

I went crazy and yoloed it all in GME, AMC, BB, and NOK. Ended up like 40K down and the combination of the other market that shall not be named in this sub, and my very thinly paper hands, I sold. Thank god I invested what was left in the market that shall not be named and now I'm richer than I've ever been.

I'm so sad I missed the second rally, I'm a longtime crayon eating ape and will be for life, but will forever remember by paper hands blunder.

I really hope GME reaches a 10000 and all my fellow apes make 100 the money I've made in the past month. It will be bittersweet, but definitely more sweet than bitter.

A naked March 12 call option with a strike price of $270 would have exposed the seller to a loss of $56 a share.

523,GME," OP made a mistake. Buying puts does potentially cause a gamma squeeze, but the other direction. Puts encourage a negative gamma squeeze by putting an overleveraged stock like GME back in neutral. If enough puts are opened with market makers, they'd start selling stock on the potential that they may have to buy it from puts being in-the-money to be delta-gamma neutral.

The same strategy the people in GME are using to boost the price can be easily played in reverse to collapse it or even depress it. I suspect part of the volume of 2M shares sold on Wednesday was one part retail panic caused by the sell of 259k shares sold at 240 limit, but also shares being released after a significant number of 330p were opened about 10 minutes before the 259k share exit.

The only reason this strategy hasn't been employed yet is the hedge funds are still playing in the options playground and are enjoying the volatility to create more plays. They're deeply involved in GME's price movements both up and down, and are happy to leave retail high and dry north of 300.",BackgroundSearch30,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3zh49/gme_dd_friday_opex_312_post_mortem_warning_gamma/gqts4dy/,0.102,0.686,0.212,0.9746

555,GME," I'm with you.  I've grown less enamored with ""fundamentals"".

What is fundamental value when you boil it down?  It is essentially some group of people thinking that a stock is worth some forward projection of earnings, a price to earnings multiple.

And who decides what multiple is ""fundamental""?  The market does through supply/demand, which is all perception.  Why is Tesla valued at going on infinity P/E, when GME was valued at less than 1 before all the attention?  Why are some sectors' ""acceptable"" P/E ratios different than others?  Because fundamentals are just analysis, numbers, and ratios applied to historic data.  What generated that historic data?  Perception and supply/demand moving stock prices around.

At the end of the day a stock/company's value are dictated by what a person or group of people are willing to pay for it.  That person/group could have all manner of reasons why they paid that price, to rationalize value.  ""Fundamentals"" is but one system of rationalization.

572,GME," Yes. Buying a call option gives you the right BUT NOT the obligation to buy a stock at a certain price.

If GME is 260 and I buy a 265 call ( which means a call option with the strike price of 265 ) it means I expect the stock to go up in price (as much as possible) because that one call option allows me to buy 100 shares of the stock at 265 dollars. So if the stock goes to 300 for example, I can exercise my call and buy 100 shares at 265 dollars. That is 35 dollars less for every share I buy. Since I am allowed to buy 100, that is 35x100=3500 dollars profit.

But if the stock doesn't reach the strike price, I am not obligated to buy the shares. All I lose is the premium (the money that I paid to enter into that bet).

So basically, instead of using their money to buy shares, people use the money to buy bets. This is because they can make more money that way and risk losing less. 

There are a lot more details about the option game that makes you or loses you money, but it would take me a ton of time to do so.

In this example, if you end up buying the $300 call expiring Mar 26th and the stock price hits $300 (which is the STRIKE PRICE you chose before buying that OPTION), and It keeps going above your STRIKE PRICE then you'll have an option to buy those 100 shares at the underlying price which is $300 here, regarless of what the market price is. Let's say the the $GME stock price hits $1000 which is obviously possible, then you'll be entitled to buy those 100 Shares at $300, meaning you'll spend $30000 to buy those shares. Now that you OWN those shares, you'll be able to sell those at the MARKET PRICE ($1000 here). Meaning you'd be selling those shares at the price $100000. 

So you expenses were $30000
And your sales were $100000

So your NET PROFIT is going to be $70000.
Keep in mind you don't have to go through the process of buying those shares and then selling them. You could just sell that CALL OPTION to someone else for a minimum of $70000, since that is how much that CALL OPTION is going to be worth at that point in time.

596,GME," This is why the best way to beat them is to buy SHARES, not options or LEAPS. Both the latter can be manipulated to oblivion.

And the shares must be bought on cash accounts, no margin. With lending prohibited wherever broker has that option enabled.

Look again at Ken Griffin‚Äôs testimony to Congress: he says - and emphasises - that options MUST be registered at the ‚Äòpublic exchange‚Äô.

Why did he bring it up? Griffin thought that slipping that titbit into the discussion helped absolve Citadel of accusations of manipulation, because options ‚Äòmust be registered at the public exchange‚Äô. Because this means the INFORMATION becomes public knowledge and the competing market participants can see it. It‚Äôs supposedly transparent and accurate. It allows OP to look at the data and compile this post.

600,GME," Fellow older ape appreciates your wrinkles.

That's all good work.

I had done a much more simpler calculation about a week ago on so looking at the public end of the float and: 

If I had to throw a number at it based off of just the vacuum that is reddit - and let's pretend for a moment that reddit represents 70% the world public portion of the float.

GME has 163K members - let's say 90% there have an average of 5 shares = 733k. I would presume that /GME would represent the die hard fanatical diamond hands for the stonk, thus the super high assumption of 90% ownership within just that sub. GME came out of WSBnew which came out of WSB.

WSBNew has 799k members - let's say 50% there have an average of 5 shares = 2 Million

WSB has 9.4M members - let's say 25% there have an average of 5 shares = 11.75M

So /GME+/WSBNew+/WSB = 14,483,000. Now...multiply that out by 1.3 - and - well, there it is: 18,827,900.

That number was from last week. Since then, WSB has added another 100K members, WSBNew has added another 3K, and GME has added about 31K.

Also - if apes are doing their only two jobs that they have (buy and hold)...(LOL I actually averaged up right during the monster dip on Wed), then that 19M has only grown. 22M?",FunctionalGray,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m47vi8/gme_option_flow_by_the_number_just_hodl_smooth/gqtkb14/,0.029,0.867,0.104,0.9337

611,GME," The initial flaws:

1. Options aren't shorts
2. Volume isn't open interest

Because of this the rest of it is moot.

You make statements like 

> There are currently 8.2 million more shares than outstanding (before apes and dfv of course).Short total should be around 28million shares.Meaning 36.437 million shares need to be bought in order to cover.

But you don't know that they haven't already hedged their positions.

Again, options is *not* stock shorting, this is the options market which I and many others participate in to generate wealth.  Just because somebody doesn't believe in the over-hype doesn't mean they're short.  I wouldn't be that hesitant to buy PUTS on GME because with the right expiration they will absolutely print money.  I assume since you've dug up option flow that you are knowledgeable enough to understand how MM's delta-hedge positions with the goal of ensuring that by the time the closing prices exceeds the strike for calls they've sold, that they own 100% of the shares required to cover.  Gamma is acceleration and if they are over-exposed during a market with poor liquidity gamma's impact on their delta's enters them into the infinite feedback loop that they need to escape to control their hedging risk - this is one of the reasons circuit-breakers exist, to allow the market makers to re-base and determine how to get ahead of gamma since it's their job to make the market they should at least be protected from chaos.

There is far more at play here than 99% of you seem to realize.  This play was identified by HNWI's in December and it was executed in January.  There is evidence that the investment banks offered the shorts an exit-strategy that didn't end up in a squeeze and the shorts refused to take it - then the stock squeezed.   I don't pretend to know what's going to happen next here but many of you are very disillusioned into thinking that you hold the HF's hostage.  They are protected.  They were protected when the brokers stopped allowing buying and their positions are protected now because they aren't just going to let that happen again.  These people aren't stupid, maybe greedy, but they understand how the market works and have access to information and liquidity that retail does not.  It's not as simple as pulling option flow or yahoo finance data and going all CSI on it.

612,SI," I don't think deep ITM calls make any sense for HF's covering shorts, I think it's more likely they were purchased by HNWI's or HF's that want MM hedging to propel the stock price upwards.

I still the trade has some legs to it for the next few days - I'm still in but I think people need a reality check on this one.  People buying-in at $265 with money that they can't afford to lose thinking that shares are going to $1000 is a sure thing is just poor risk management.  Maybe it will, I hope it does, but from my analysis if it doesn't happen this week I strongly doubt the trade will continue to be profitable from these entry-points.  

The problem is, and this is where I take issue with your analysis (and others as well) is there is no way to be accurate and such analysis propagates the belief that the hive wants to hear: HF's are short a % of float that isn't tenable and the squeeze is still on.  Just as much as I can't say that it is, I can't say that it isn't, I accept that, but I tend to be believe the results from S3 partners who does this for money and has clearly stated that the SI is below 20% at this point in time.  In this sub stating these thoughts is considered shill behavior, which is scary itself.  ""Don't fight the crowd"" is going to lead to a lot of disillusion and bag-holding.  The number of ""Why $100k isn't a meme"" posts that get upvoted into the stratosphere scares the shit out of me for some of these young traders.  In reality while the SI is estimably still high, it isn't necessarily squeeze-material without more capital - and how much more capital is going to be thrown into this?  When the shorts can borrow shares at 1% annual interest and ladder-attack the price down to price-pins that limit their risk to prices where they've sold calls/puts in order to pay for their borrow cost.

That's where my graphic from earlier comes into play.  3/19 has an incredible amount of open interest.  The value of all open interest is in the billions, whereas every date following this Friday pales in comparison.

664,RKT," I just went through refinancing my house because of the rates going so low. Since it was a pandemic I also didn‚Äôt want to go into a bunch of banks and talk to people. I emailed places and got on Rocket. I was weary about Rocket bc I thought it was for people who struggled to get better rates from traditional institutions. After everything was said and done, I compared all the offers I got and went with Rocket. Best decision ever. I could do everything online, I had someone who emailed me and called if I needed and walked me through and explained all the numbers. I only had one person drive to my house at the day of closing to sign all the paperwork for 15 minutes. They charged a tiny bit more but being someone that doesn‚Äôt like to deal with slick haired Bob at the bank, I decide it was worth it. 

I like the stock. I think they have a great product. Their biggest hurdle is boomers and others who thought like me in the beginning (only for people who can‚Äôt get a traditional loan). But their process was so easy, I can see this being what younger people lean towards as banks struggle to keep up with technology.

674,HUGE," You're claiming short positions are over-leveraged but even on IBKR's data, right now there are 5 million shares to borrow and the borrow fee is a measly 1.8%. Keep in mind that IBKR's data is technically incomplete because its based only on input from one broker (IBKR) and doesn't represent the full market float; there's likely significantly more than 5 million shares available to short.

You really think large scale funds that actually move the markets use TDA? Those restrictions are for limiting retail risk, not the big boys.

Also, short interest is 20% with 20m shares shorted, and shorts have been gradually covering all week. https://i.redd.it/g7n88sv5ymm61.jpg Is it still heavily shorted? Yes. It is shorted enough to be squeezed without some HUGE moves from whales, whales that have no reason to act this week or any other week? NO.

All of your data on this post is old data from before 3/2's 70% run-up which was combination gamma ramp and shorts in the weakest position getting squeezed out. Squeeze was squoze, new ones opened at $40 and they paid the dividend because it was profitable enough to do so, and if they want to keep RKT at maximum pain to eat up premiums, they have more than enough ammunition to do so.

Look, maybe I'll get some long ITM calls because I think RKT has some legitimacy as a long term hold and it's more likely to trade sideways than downward. But there is NO CATALYST for this play in the short term. None, zip, zero, nada. You are throwing pigs off a cliff and hoping one of them will eventually fly by hoping a whale will buy in 20% of the float for a squeeze and gamma ramp after a substantial decrease in short interest. Gambles are gambles but if you are thinking about buying in, consider the risk and opportunity cost realistically. 

If you're gambling on a short term play (within the next ~2 months until earnings in May), there's literally no catalyst for another spike at all unless you think some fucking magic will happen for 3/19's quad witching.

730,DD," I thought so too initially but started doing some DD on them a couple weeks back and liked what I saw. To be clear, I know jack about mortgages and stuff, but I liked a few things I found out doing research. For one, they have kind of a vertical integration thing going on where they have different companies that are all involved in different parts of the housing market, from mortgages to advertising homes for sale, which means they kind of own a corner of that market to themselves and don‚Äôt have to rely on outside companies as much, rocket can theoretically handle pretty much everything involved in a home buying process in-house. Another factor I liked was that the execs haven‚Äôt taken the shorts laying down, they found ways to fight back, like announcing a massive stock buy back that will take place this year as well as announcing a special dividend of $1.1/share paid to all holders as of 03/05. These counterattacks showed that management has a good sense of strategy and is willing to actively defend the company‚Äôs interests instead of being at the mercy of the market; they also are a big part of what caused the last huge squeeze on the shorts that shot the price up to $40+ as shorts had to struggle to cover ASAP.

837,GME," I don't even understand what Yoda was trying to accomplish. 

The jedi council:

* Was madly involved with politics, although always passive aggressively until the clone wars.

* More or less abducted young children who shows force sensitivity, but only if they were young enough. Leaving the older children to fend for themselves or find a nice Sith daddy.

* Couldn't figure out how to end a war where the enemy was 99% cheap remotely controlled robots.

* Yoda spent 500+ years training and couldn't even figure out immortality until Qui-Gon came back as a ghost and taught him.

* Practiced cult-like rules and forbade basic humanoid emotions such as Love. 

* Knew about the existence of ancient Jedi temples and Grey Jedi texts that offered actual balance to the force, and just ignored them. Yoda eventually comes back as a ghost just to burn them via controlled atmospheric lightning.

* Not a single member of the council could use future-vision to figure out padme and anakin were banging, despite it being blatantly obvious and him being unable to control himself.

* The force sensitive babies in paddy's womb, they couldn't even detect those.

* 3 Jedi masters basically instantly fell in a fight against 1 sith while Mace Windu couldn't even finish the job.

* Yoda got bested in a Lightsaber fight basically every time he fought another Lightsaber holder. He also showed almost no prowess with the force outside of lifting xwings out of swamps. Finally uses future-vision when Luke tries to go to cloud city but basically says ""not sure, try again later"" like some kinda shitty magic 8ball.

* The Jedi obviously had a shit ton of money and real estate on coruscant. Yet failed in every conceivable way to understand the financials involved with cloning a huge army and following the money to the source.

* Pretty much murdered Jango Fett for no reason and left his head for his son to find.

1001,GME," So in January there was actually real concern that the Gamestop rise would crash the markets, and it wasn't unjustified. If there are no shares to cover with, the price can go up forever. This you all know, and everyone here talks about what to do when the price goes to mars, etc. 

But, if a hedge fund has infinite losses, they must sell all their stock. Other funds aren't going to buy it at high prices since htey know the short fund is under duress. They will pull their bids on the entire market to get the short fund to sell at the worst possible price. Some of them might even sell significant portions of their own holdings to get ahead of that situation. 

The amount of leverage in the system, though, could cause margin calls at that point, which would have tanked the markets even further. 

That';s not even getting to the point that once the hedge funds can't cover and go bankrupt, their brokers are on teh hook. The brokers would then need to sell off their stock to try to meet the cover obligation, and, when the couldnt, they would have gone bankrupt too. But then the clearinghouses would have been on the hook. I doubt the clearing houses have much collateral of their own, but, by that point the entire system has been disrupted and key critical segments of the market have been interrupted. Companies that provide liquidity may have gone bankrupt and hte market would have been in complete turmoil. 

It wasn't unreasonable to believe this in January before they conspired to block buying on GME. If they didn't conspire to block buying, it might have actually happened.",rawbdor,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3wdhu/there_are_more_retail_investors_than_ever_but_we/gqrw1ek/,0.113,0.877,0.01,-0.9826

I walked away from both holding the same opinion of them. I used to brag on M1 solely for their ease of entry, and great UI. No bullshit their ""pie"" concept made investing for professional retards like myself much easier.

I LOVED everything about M1. What they set out to do they did fantastically well. Money went in. Stonks got bought. Dividends got paid. DRIP did it's thing.

1108,UWMC," Great post! After learning more about UWMC I have invested more into the stock. Currently around 50% of the loan process uses manual effort and there is an opportunity to utilize automation tools like UiPath to increase automation which would save 5% to 10% of loan costs. There is other opportunities to automate some underwriting process which would further cut cost by 20% to 25% and UWMC is working on all of this. They are making applying for mortgages a lot easier, faster, and cheaper.

The brokers will love this. They get a fully automated mortgage application system, cuts out lengthy human activities, ensures all federal, local laws are met.

I'm not smart enough to know if you're right or wrong about any of this, but I do get the feeling we are being lied to about SI% from FINRA/S3. My broker is telling me that if I want to short GME, I'll be paying ridiculously high interest rates, AND must maintain a 500% margin requirement. No other stock has these requirements... 

If SI% on GME is so low and the shorts have mostly covered, why am I being quoted a price that suggests otherwise?

Another commenter suggested using your method to determine the SI% of another stock to test the accuracy of your methods. I think that's a great idea and would be very interested in reading the results if you choose to do this.

1119,SI," Idk anything but it seems to me that someone is just ignoring that if all those shorts were ""millisecond shorts"" they would be matched by an equal volume of long trade.

So if every day short volume > than long volume that means that at least the difference between short and long = to the new shorts.

If basically everyday that ratio is more than 50% how the hell are they reducing shorts? Even if not increasing as much as OP says, even if 99.9% of the trades were ""millisecond shorts"" the SI would at least stay the same. I still doubt that 140 -> 20 drop.

TL;DR
I think SI as % of float is at least 100%",zampyx,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4btuq/proof_that_hfs_are_lying_to_finra_but_thats_fine/gqu2t0f/,0.135,0.865,0.0,-0.952

1121,SI," I‚Äôm sceptical of 600/900% or what have you, but still very much believe in 100%+. 

I don‚Äôt think anyone should take this as gospel, but given only long positions are needed to be reported, shorts have no incentive to truthfully declare their true position, specially if doing so could be detrimental to your position and all you face is a fine in the 10s of thousands why even bother. 

It came from him attempting to justify reported data and he just can‚Äôt match anything up. So then led to this. 

I think It could be 200/300% if the free float is as limited as it seems and not at the 50m or so quoted, but more in the 24~30m.

I also agree that it‚Äôs definitely a cash grab too as Hulu announced this the day GME spiked to $345+. Would it be better to wait to finish a doc like this to get all the details- yes.

Sentiment is overall very positive and a stable baseline price won't be set for a long time.

Its got huge attention in the market and is getting tons of free advertizing as well which only helps. It will not be staying this low for long. With Cohen's vision and the company moving realize that vision GME will start getting price valuations as a tech company instead of its historical brick and mortar retail valuation. Some people see the nearly 100x increase in price over the last year and assume its a bubble, but thats just the beauty of having such a low float.

I'm sitting on cost of $100 and I honestly don't believe we will ever see that number again.

Just look at AMC, everyone was talking about the death of theatres and how great streaming services are, but now people are boycotting Netflix and Disney plus over Cuties and Gina Carano as a part of cancel culture while people are begging to get back into theatre seats and realizing the value of ""the movies"" as a venue in and of itself.

1321,SP," Cool, so Robinhood let's you trade what's called covered options. Options are a contract that is made between you and the seller of the contract that states you have the right to purchase shares of the underlying stock for the price agreed upon.  This is called the strike price, but it's really just the price that you can purchase the stock at. So You now own the right not the responsibility to purchase the stock at anytime between now and when the option closes. Some would say you have the OPTION to purchase the stock at the agreed upon price not the obligation. Option contracts are actually a bundle of contracts covering 100 shares. 

So the seller is betting that by the date the the share price will be ""out of the money"" or beneath the contract strike price and you are betting it will be above it. Because I'd you buy the right to purchase goev at 15 dollars for 100 shares and it's 30 dollars by the time the contract is up you now own 15 x 100 in value.  This is why options are called derivative products because they derive the value from what they contain not from the actual share of the company.

The price per contract represents money times 100 shares because it is the price per share so a 5 cent 3/19 30c is 5 bucks a contract... 0.05 cents per share x 100 shares = 1 call option contract.

If the Share Price at the time of expiry is 14.99 the option is worthless because you could just go to market and buy it there cheaper it just wouldn't make sense to ""execute"" the option on 99 percent of the situations. A short squeeze is actually one of the situations where executing makes sense for shorts underwater. 

So if I was going to sell you the right to buy goev at 100 bucks, that's a lot of risk for you and not a lot of risk for me so the price would be low... 0.05 cents per contract x100 contracts per bundle would be 5 bucks.  So you with 50 bucks could have 10 contracts... I take your 50 bucks and think I made a good trade...

Tomorrow UBER says they partnered. (A very real possibility) and it revalues the company at 75 billion dollars or so which is 20x it's current share price of so like 200 and now you have the right to buy 10 bundles of 100 shares at 100 dollars per share  that you could immediately sell that on the market for profit. So you spent 50 bucks but in the end will make (10,000 x 100 dollars) so 100,000 dollars) from 50...  But people will buy that form you for that much so you don't have to actually purchase the shares...  so the price of that contract would be 100 (with a little sugar on top for how much time is left on it) x100 per contract. Now what if the expiry of this contract was tomorrow... Is it very likely that the valuation of goev will be 100 tomorrow? No so that would be dumb to even buy for any money.. but what about in 2 years... Well that's way more likely and so the price will change based upon the likelihood of the sp achieving these prices..
.

So you wanna buy options when the stock is down because you get your max benefits like shares... 

You will never owe money on Robinhood because you can only buy or sell calls or puts that are covered. Covered means you set the shares aside 100 of them until expiry.. naked means you have enough big baller money to say hey.. I'm good for it... Naked options are where the theoretically infinity loss comes from sue to the fact that the share price could change infinitely... As in what if you needed 100 shares and there's only 101 and I knew you needed them so I could charge you whatever money I wanted... This is where naked shorting gets I to a problem...  Those calls you bought? Someone else is covering them or more likely a market maker worth billions is good for them. Robinhood wouldn't let you be that dumb... 

The last piece here is that market makers have to maintain a certain amount of shares on hand per every option they sell.. this is related to the Delta which is the change in price over time... So a Delta of .5 means that for every 100 shares a market maker has to own 50 if the price goes over the strike price or itm at expiry a market maker has to have 100 shares per 1 contract sold. So it goes and just buys it at market.  There are a metric fuckton of calls that are sold on goev that are approaching being in the money and when they do mm have to buy which drives up the price... I  actually suspect a bunch of gambling addicted apes are jack those numbers to Mars.  Making MM purchase millions of shares per every dollar of valuation. 

For example there are currently 26523 contracts for 3/29 17.5c 26523 x100 means those contracts represent 2.6 million shares.  When the SP hits 16 and it becomes more likely that it will be in the money market makers will go to market and purchase 265k shares and that's just for that one call for 1 dollar..

This is the real game your playing and how you fit into it my friend...

When the SP hits 16 and it becomes more likely that it will be in the money market makers will go to market and purchase 265k shares and that's just for that one call for 1 dollar..

This is the real game your playing and how you fit into it my friend...

If you are going to put alot of money in, buy over time, using ""laddered"" limit buy borders, with good til cancelled.

Conversely, if you have experience with options and are FULLY convinced about the long term value of the company, sell cash covered puts. Or, more simply, get paid to buy the stock (as long as the price drops) 

Or buy some longer dated ITM calls. 

But DON'T YOLO into a large position. 

This week some dumbass bought ~1 million shares of DIS all at once with a market order. The price spiked like $10 a share in ~1 minute.

So that guy WAY overpaid.

1339,IMO," Most teenagers don't even know who Steve jobs was. You might be right, but Jobs has nothing to do with that. It's their tech that was getting stale, but tbh the M1 looks phenomenal, so they might have just pulled another trick that will significantly increase their value. At this point with apple it's impossible to say when the stock will stop.

Not to mention the fact that they still are very strongly perceived as a luxury brand, and anything they make is bought at unbelievable prices just because it has a big white apple on it.

So overall it's still a very good investment IMO. Not financial advice of course, I'm a retarded",drestonxyz,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3v3pt/yolo_using_100k_of_margin_to_buy_palantir_and/gqs2vaj/,0.072,0.805,0.123,0.7564
