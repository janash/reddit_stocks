154,CMC," $HSTO jump on before 12th Feb. FDA approval results- if positive this will fly 🚀

Histogen Inc. is a clinical-stage therapeutics company focused on developing potential first-in-class restorative therapeutics that ignite the body’s natural process to repair and maintain healthy biological function. Histogen’s innovative technology platform utilizes cell conditioned media.

“”Histogen has not yet received the written notice of its clinical hold from the FDA, which the FDA expects to provide to the company by February 12, 2021. Based upon the verbal communication with FDA, they indicated that the clinical hold is due to pending CMC information that is required to complete their review. Histogen plans to work diligently with the FDA to seek the release of the clinical hold and provide updated guidance on any potential impact to the HST-003 program once the written notice from FDA is received””

155,TNXP," I think it will be a long play(by 2022) but I think TNXP has huge upside potential. Like actually triple digit end value. If you look at the stock, it tumbled in 2018 from $400 to penny stock status over the course of 12 months. This is mainly due to the failure of their very promising PTSD drug.

They now have multiple products in the pipeline. They announced good findings for phase 3 trials of a new fibromyalgia drug. If you know anything about the condition, the current drugs on the market aren't generally liked by patients, with varying efficacy. If they can be a new, better player they can practically corner the market.

Then there's the covid skin test, which will again be a novel product, that could have huge upside if it can get to market soon enough. I think the research into it will be useful regardless of the timeline, and a valuable property.

A Covid vaccine is also in the pipeline, but by the time it comes to market, it will have to be significantly better in some way to have much impact.

Even a modest recuperation of 10% of it's pre-tumble price is big increase.

You may want to hold off on purchase, because they just announced a public offering, which usually drops the price a bit. But I'm in for 2000 @ 1.30 average and I believe in the potential.",hsilman,7,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lf0a07/daily_discussion_thread/gmly4j5/,0.029,0.803,0.168,0.9879

525,GME," Yea I wish I bought a lot more but such is the game. I’m on the conservative side with investing right now especially I don’t have much to work with. But I will tell you, I’ve been taking 15-20% profit in small stocks. It’s been more profitable than waiting for the Unicorn or putting everything into one company. 

Sometimes they go waaaay above expectations (plug, fcel) but I take profit when I can and be in green rather than waiting and possibly be in red. 

Again I’m a very small time buyer and only have enough to buy a few shares at a time. But in a year I’ve went from $700 to $300 (learned a lot about pump and dumps lol) to $2000 right now. 

Sure I’d love to be the guy making thousands or tens of thousands, but I got to work with what I’ve got. Maybe one day it will happen, but I want to play safe and smart.
