122,EV,"I think this is a misunderstanding of where Tesla is in terms of the competition in the EV race in terms of automakers by pretty much all of Reddit. 

Yes, Tesla has nifty battery and auto tech that is putting their EVs ahead of the competition. Their downfall is the lack of, and inability to mass produce and cut costs where it matters to make Tesla a household name the way Toyotas, Chevys, Hondas, and Fords are, in addition to a lack of overall infrastructure that supports these EVs — but that will come with more widespread appeal of EVs to general consumers and mass populations.

Currently, car manufacturers haven’t been able to build sustainable vehicles with their batteries and on-board computers/software to get anything more than an EV that gets like half the range a Tesla would, and that’s the absolute best they can do. 

The time’s coming though. As these companies put their heads together and continue to learn from Tesla’s tech, and eventually figure out what makes Tesla so special, they’ll out-manufacture Tesla’s vehicles into near non-existence beyond just being another pricey brand name, and being even less popular than they are now. And by partnering with software giants, they’ll bring entire windows/Apple and other branded ecosystems to vehicles and revolutionize how people drive in the next probably 5-10 years. 

When this time comes, it won’t be about Tesla vehicles more than it is the Tesla batteries. Future EVs will likely be a combination of software ecosystems that drive an economic (and entertaining) mass-produced vehicle by the big brand names we’ve known for like 80+ years, while having a Tesla battery in them. Tesla hasn’t yet shown that it’s ready to take the world economy by storm despite being so far ahead in terms of tech, because Tesla isn’t actually interested in being the next big car manufacturer. Tesla isn’t going to be developing millions of vehicles and investing in that kind of manufacturing power. 

This is all just a vehicle for which Tesla can promote their battery tech and programming/software advances because the real money will be in letting the big names with established plants everywhere around the world already invested in manufacturing, build the cars, while Tesla sits back and does what they do best with their batteries and tech and takes their cut.",0.027,0.865,0.108,0.9888

182,BB,"I've been in and out of Blackberry since it used to be called ""Research in Motion"".  Down at $5, it was probably undervalued.  But up here, I'm less sure.

All of the recent move has been with zero tangibly financial news.  By that I mean there's no sale, no order, no deal, no merger, no investment.

It's been solely driven by a name drop. 

And when you look into that name drop, it's a vague partnership with no dollars attached.  

People are ""discovering"" something that's been known for years: Blackberry writes car software now.  Blackberry owns QNX.  These are not news to anyone who has followed the,.

The name drop deal sounds like Amazon wants to the third (or fourth?) search engine name on car radio type systems.  Instead of apple or Google Car play, drivers can say "" hey Alexa"" to the car instead of through their phone.  I don't see that as revolutionary.  It seems more like akin to adding an Amazon icon to a desktop.   Are they even paying BB for that, and if so, how much?  

Prior the recent 100%+ mania, the main talk among BB investors was whether or not they should liquidate patents, and which ones. 

The in-car system markets that fresh new investors are assuming BB will be getting into... they're already in.  So the growth potential there might not be as big as some think since it's already captured.  

And from a macro perspective, when it comes to putting components into a vehicle, every manufacturer pinches their pennies like mad.  They go with the lowest bid supplier.  If Blackberry tries gouging too much for their in-car systems, they stand a chance of being bumped for someone else who will underbid them.  The car makers don't care.  It's not like a car buyer can select which system is in their Ford or Toyota.  They just buy the vehicle, and whatever screen shows the radio station and backup camera is basically a utility to them.",0.085,0.844,0.071,-0.5723

Basically, I’m not saying you’re wrong but saying it’s worth picking out some value investments now. If Micheal Burrys predictions are true there also might be a passive ETF bubble collapse taking out a lot of “safe” investments.

This same argument could have been made in 1999, ""valuations don't matter, buy tech"". This would have worked fine until you lost 90% of your portfolio in the subsequent crash.

What you should be doing if you believe there is a bubble is rotating into value now which in theory will protect you from most the damage when all the stocks with unrealistic growth expectations come crashing down.

It's worth remembering that everyone buying tech in 1999 was a genius too. The fact people on Reddit think they're outsmarting the market by buying overpriced EV stocks (or whatever is cool this week) because there will always be another Redditor stupid enough to buy it off them for more should be an indication that you should stay away from those stocks.

So no, this is an awful idea unless you genuinely believe you're going to be able to time the market perfectly and switch into value right at the peak – which you won't be able to.

Their results are solid. There is a statisticaly significant advantage to Voclosporin compared to the control, with a p-value <0.0001. This means there was a *less than 0.001%* chance that the advantage of using Voclosporin was due to random chance. 

Moreover, their drug was given priority review back in July 2020. Combing through the FDA's historical results, a whopping *89%* of drugs given priority review in 2018-2019 were approved. Now, this does *NOT* necessarily mean Voclosporin will be approved as correlation does NOT mean causation, however, it is just interesting to consider nonetheless.

There are ETF that are sector based such as ICLN for clean energy, LIT for batteries.

There are some active managed (an agent keep removing bad stocks and adding good stocks instead of blindly following index) famous one nowadays are ARK series",0.039,0.777,0.184,0.9493

587,AAPL,"So there's something called a ""Realized gain"" and ""Unrealized gain"". ""Realized"" means you cashed out so it keeps track of your entry point and whether or not you made or lost money. At the end of the year, you should be able to see what your realized gains are (at least from TDAmeritrade you can). Say your realized gains are $2,000. Then you pay taxes for that $2k. On Jan 1, that resets to 0 (as far as tracking it but you can look at your history to see what you made (or lost) in the prior year).

Unrealized gains are holdings that you haven't cashed out on. So if you're up $5,000 on AAPL but didn't cash out, you are not responsible for taxes at the end of the year. YOu only pay taxes for Realized gains. If you LOST money and are negative in your Realized gains, then you subtract that amount from the gross revenue you made that year.

I'd love to YOLO into something and ride out the highs and lows for the massive gains, but I have small kids and a mortgage and I assume I'm older than a good 50-70 percent of the people who post here, so my risk tolerance can't handle much of what I read about around here or on WSB. 

Having a firm grasp of my own risk tolerance and what does or doesn't fit pretty much eliminates FOMO for me. It also keeps me from being bitter when it works out for other people and makes them money. 

Example: TSLA makes no sense to me. I gained profits over a short time when I bought the Sept dip at a little over $400 and got out before $600. Current valuation makes no sense to me, but to everyone reading this from the moon, congrats on your bitchin trip!",0.133,0.701,0.166,0.778

- The 'Tesla Effect'; not necessarily to the extreme level as Tesla, but generating hype around their product lines increases capital flow via investment

- They already have infrastructure in place for high volume production of any vehicular product, so they don't need to invest at the same rate as new challengers

- GM has a diverse lineup of vehicles and brands that can aid the arduous transition with their various strengths and appealing to specific audiences

- A similar effect to what Apple faced with smartphones; we can safely pronounce Tesla the 'Apple' of EVs. We can expect opposing brands to partner with each other to compete better with Tesla, such as the partnerships between Google, Samsung, Microsoft, but extrapolated to EVs. I believe GM can be the 'Samsung' in this scenario

- Government subsidies will almost definitely be directed towards helping electric vehicle production, we saw this in Canada already with a $1bln electric vehicle plant for GM. I believe GM can better leverage governments due to pre-existing relations

- GM is looking to have positive net cash on hand soon, is rebounding nicely after the effects of COVID, has constant cash flow, increasing profit margin, etc.

- They have tonnes of assets, which they can leverage or liquidate if needed

- Liabilities are the only issue, though I believe with the current sentiment surrounding GM, they may be able disregard that. The transition to EVs is going to take a long time, autonomous vehicles even longer, and GM won't necessarily have to go about it ultra-rapidly, and won't have to spend too much

Again, not a hundred percent sure about them, but they seem like a fairly good investment for people experienced with automaking investments, maybe not- I tend to stick with financials above all.",0.022,0.832,0.146,0.9922

Don’t buy anything you don’t know. If you can’t explain in 3 bullet points why you own a stock - don’t buy it. Don’t chase hype.

Again - just my beginner lessons - take them for what they’re worth.",0.042,0.843,0.115,0.9487
736,SNOW,"The thing that really hurt me when starting out was making large unrealised returns, but holding too long and losing most of it. Knowing when to sell is extremely important, especially if you're in riskier mid-cap growth names. It's worth remembering that $1.5k you made can easily be wiped out if you don't take profits.

A lot of the stocks that go up 200% in a month while being hyped here often fall 30-40% in the months after. If you get in early to these trade you may still be up, but you would have lost most of the returns. If you get in late, you'll often be down. SNOW did this recently. It was up 60% in December, but now it's down over 25% from its December peak. If you got in early you might still be 10% up, but if you got in when everyone was hyping it here because it was going up 5-10% every day, you're probably down.

I feel like half my comments are warning people about this. You might feel pretty smart if your TSLA investment went from $25,000 to $50,000 last year, but given that a fair valuation for TSLA may be 80-90% lower than it's current market price you're taking a huge risk if you're not taking some of those profits. It's easy to outperform in the short-term simply by chasing the popular stocks that are rallying, but in my experience they almost always drop leaving most people who FOMOed in those position bag holding.

It sounds like you're doing something right if you're avoiding FOMO though, but it's still important to sell if you feel valuations are becoming stretched. I like to look for positions that I believe have less than 20% downside with more than 100% upside over the next two years. Stocks in my portfolio which I feel could drop more than 20% over the next year normally get sold off and swapped for other positions with more attractive risk/rewards.",0.095,0.775,0.13,0.9454

There are rumours of offering. Hell. It may tentatively bring the stock price down or maybe totally skyrocket like crazy. What I believe is,

1) This company won't do offering at all in near future. The reason for that is they are already getting paid contracts and awesome deals. It's always in any company's interest to avoid offering if they don't need it as offering forever gets slapped in company's history and future investors take it as a measure.

2) And, if they do get offering they will use it properly to bring value to the company which will eventually drive the revenue and hence, the share price.

There is HP, which has the Reverb out, that gets great reviews, but it won't have near the market share that the Quest 2 does. 

I don't know if HTC is public *or* if they're even working on a follow-up to the Vive, but they have a big VR software marketplace as well as a solid VR subscription plan called Viveport. If they are public, maybe take a look at them. 

Microsoft also has the HoloLens but same issue still. That's more business-facing from what I understand so there's a good chance they could make surprising money from that.

Valve has the Index but they're a private company and that'll likely never change.

In all honesty, unless there's an *extremely* promising VR startup somewhere, you'll have to settle for a total-package kinda deal where you buy shares of the company and only 1-5% of it is actually VR-related.
