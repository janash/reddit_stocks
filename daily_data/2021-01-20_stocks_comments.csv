However, if EPS goes up, PE will go down again, which most of the market expects right now, and has already started to take place as companies report earnings beats.

194,BB,"I've been in and out of Blackberry since it used to be called ""Research in Motion"".  Down at $5, it was probably undervalued.  But up here, I'm less sure.

All of the recent move has been with zero tangibly financial news.  By that I mean there's no sale, no order, no deal, no merger, no investment.

It's been solely driven by a name drop. 

And when you look into that name drop, it's a vague partnership with no dollars attached.  

People are ""discovering"" something that's been known for years: Blackberry writes car software now.  Blackberry owns QNX.  These are not news to anyone who has followed the,.

The name drop deal sounds like Amazon wants to the third (or fourth?) search engine name on car radio type systems.  Instead of apple or Google Car play, drivers can say "" hey Alexa"" to the car instead of through their phone.  I don't see that as revolutionary.  It seems more like akin to adding an Amazon icon to a desktop.   Are they even paying BB for that, and if so, how much?  

Prior the recent 100%+ mania, the main talk among BB investors was whether or not they should liquidate patents, and which ones. 

The in-car system markets that fresh new investors are assuming BB will be getting into... they're already in.  So the growth potential there might not be as big as some think since it's already captured.  

And from a macro perspective, when it comes to putting components into a vehicle, every manufacturer pinches their pennies like mad.  They go with the lowest bid supplier.  If Blackberry tries gouging too much for their in-car systems, they stand a chance of being bumped for someone else who will underbid them.  The car makers don't care.  It's not like a car buyer can select which system is in their Ford or Toyota.

Blackberry had Apple-level customer devotion and market share that makes current Apple and Microsoft look like failures.  The phones seemed to be made like hockey helmets and were unbreakable. Yet the actual Internet user experience (to me) was garbage.  The WSB-equivalent fanboys of the day were posting RIMM yolos and swearing they would hold Blackberry forever.  ""could it possibly go down?"" would get you flamed.  I remember wild debates about every tiny aspect of the keyboard and buttons.  

They actually had a wicked infrastructure powering it, with messages that were secure and didn't get lost.  They once had a brief outage and the company executives stepped forward to explain and apologize.  They had an App Store designed to make their products useful, not to gouge the hell out of participants.  Nowadays, shitty software and outages abound and nobody has an ounce of accountability.

I bought back in quite awhile ago in the belief that quality software developers with a vault of patents had to be worth more than $5.  I hoped to see it go to $15.  But as time marched on, they never seemed to capitalize on the software thing, even during an era where trashy web and software companies were mooning constantly.  For some reason they stayed tunnel vision on supplying automakers, which I've mentioned is a ""lowest bidder"" world.  When it popped 100% on the Amazon name drop news recently I had to make a quick decision to take gains or hold.  I couldn't (and still can't) find any aspect of Amazon friendship that translate into tangible dollars.  So I decided to bail then.  Being disciplined like that can make you miss gains on bubble action, but I just never like to be holding something of dubious value that I wouldn't want to keep for several years.  I'd point to FSLY.  If FSLY and that sector collapsed overnight, I'd still wouldn't mind holding the smartest company in that arena, with the best tech.  I'd be ok waiting for rotation or retasking.

The plan is to convert excess renewable energy (e.g. from wind turbines at night) into hydrogen and use it to power factories as much as possible.

But that's as opposed to having to keep tabs on the statements, social media, and public appearances of all board members of a company with enough cultural awareness** to not only identify something as bad news, but then to be confident enough in assessing the risk it presents and reacting before the rest of the market does. 

** The level of cultural awareness would be intense and basically require fluency in Chinese on par with the average native speaking college graduate. That's the only way to recognize what the CCP would interpret as a threat and to react before the CCP or the rest of the market does. 

Without confidence in your ability to monitor board members (or at least the CEO) on this level, people should stop feeling confident in their ability to assess risk in Chinese firms. 

Regardless of what did or didn't happen to Jack Ma, the bottom line is that the richest man in China, who's also very outspoken and influential, was silenced and disappeared for months. Further, it took weeks after his disappearance grabbed global headlines before he reappeared, and once he did, it was for a smalltime event where he pretended it was business as usual and still has no comment about why he went dark and failed to speak up to quell the rumors/speculation. 

Anyone who claims to understand risks in a firm operating in a country where that happened is fooling themselves. Can you imagine something similar happening to Elon Musk and what it would be like in this country while he's gone and the alarm bells that would be going off following such a strange resurfacing?

Knowing when to sell is extremely important, especially if you're in riskier mid-cap growth names. It's worth remembering that $1.5k you made can easily be wiped out if you don't take profits.

A lot of the stocks that go up 200% in a month while being hyped here often fall 30-40% in the months after. If you get in early to these trade you may still be up, but you would have lost most of the returns. If you get in late, you'll often be down. SNOW did this recently. It was up 60% in December, but now it's down over 25% from its December peak. If you got in early you might still be 10% up, but if you got in when everyone was hyping it here because it was going up 5-10% every day, you're probably down.

You might feel pretty smart if your TSLA investment went from $25,000 to $50,000 last year, but given that a fair valuation for TSLA may be 80-90% lower than it's current market price you're taking a huge risk if you're not taking some of those profits. It's easy to outperform in the short-term simply by chasing the popular stocks that are rallying, but in my experience they almost always drop leaving most people who FOMOed in those position bag holding.

It sounds like you're doing something right if you're avoiding FOMO though, but it's still important to sell if you feel valuations are becoming stretched. I like to look for positions that I believe have less than 20% downside with more than 100% upside over the next two years. Stocks in my portfolio which I feel could drop more than 20% over the next year normally get sold off and swapped for other positions with more attractive risk/rewards.",0.095,0.775,0.13,0.9454
672,TSLA,"The thing that really hurt me when starting out was making large unrealised returns, but holding too long and losing most of it. Knowing when to sell is extremely important, especially if you're in riskier mid-cap growth names. It's worth remembering that $1.5k you made can easily be wiped out if you don't take profits.

A lot of the stocks that go up 200% in a month while being hyped here often fall 30-40% in the months after. If you get in early to these trade you may still be up, but you would have lost most of the returns. If you get in late, you'll often be down. SNOW did this recently. It was up 60% in December, but now it's down over 25% from its December peak. If you got in early you might still be 10% up, but if you got in when everyone was hyping it here because it was going up 5-10% every day, you're probably down.

832,PE,"15 times earnings is a good starting point for valuation.  This equates to a 6.6% earnings yield (the inverse of PE).  Essentially, if you paid $1,500,000 for the company ($15,000 per share), the company would return a 6.6% return on your investment through earnings.  If you want your annual return to be 10%, you would want to pay $1,000,000 for the company ($10,000 per share).  You can add the $1,000 of equipment to the valuation, but it‚Äôs really trivial in this example.  In summary, if I were buying this company, I would pay no more than $15k per share looking at it in a very basic way.

The example indicates taxes are not included; however, when you look at the earnings of a company taxes are included. So take another 20% or so off the presented profit and the real earnings would be $80k or so. This would adjust the valuation down to $1,200,000 ($1,200 per share)
